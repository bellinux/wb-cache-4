5|$|Conventional {{hydroelectricity}} <b>works</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> {{in conjunction}} with solar power, water can be held back or released from a reservoir behind a dam as required. Where a suitable river is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity uses solar power to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days then the energy is recovered at night and in bad weather by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can begin again. However, this cycle can lose 20% of the energy to round trip inefficiencies, this plus the construction costs add to the expense of implementing high levels of solar power.|$|E

25|$|Another {{suggestion}} for simplifying {{the proof is}} to make greater use of representation theory. The {{problem here is that}} representation theory seems to require very tight control over the subgroups of a group in order to work well. For groups of small rank one has such control and representation theory <b>works</b> <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> but for groups of larger rank no-one has succeeded in using it to simplify the classification. In {{the early days of the}} classification there was considerable effort made to use representation theory, but this never achieved much success in the higher rank case.|$|E
500|$|Based on Bethe's {{intuition and}} {{fundamental}} {{papers on the}} subject by Shin'ichirō Tomonaga, Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman and Freeman Dyson, it was finally possible to get fully covariant formulations that were finite at any order in a perturbation series of quantum electrodynamics. Shin'ichirō Tomonaga, Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman were jointly awarded with a Nobel prize in physics in 1965 for their work in this area. Their contributions, and those of Freeman Dyson, were about covariant and gauge invariant formulations of quantum electrodynamics that allow computations of observables at any order of perturbation theory. Feynman's mathematical technique, based on his diagrams, initially seemed {{very different from the}} field-theoretic, operator-based approach of Schwinger and Tomonaga, but Freeman Dyson later showed that the two approaches were equivalent. Renormalization, the need to attach a physical meaning at certain divergences appearing in the theory through integrals, has subsequently become one of the fundamental aspects of quantum field theory and has come {{to be seen as a}} criterion for a theory's general acceptability. Even though renormalization <b>works</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> in practice, Feynman was never entirely comfortable with its mathematical validity, even referring to renormalization as a [...] "shell game" [...] and [...] "hocus pocus".|$|E
500|$|Casting {{began in}} October 2008 with Downey's signing. Though Don Cheadle was also {{reported}} to be reprising his Iron Man 2 role of War Machine for The Avengers, he later stated {{that he did not}} think the character would appear in the film. At the same time, two major prospects occurred for Marvel: Jon Favreau was brought in as an executive producer for the film, and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget films—Iron Man2, Thor (2011), and [...] (2011)—at their Manhattan Beach, California complex. Lou Ferrigno, who voiced Hulk in The Incredible Hulk, stated that he would be involved in the film. In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury in Iron Man2 and other films. In September 2009, Edward Norton, who played Bruce Banner in The Incredible Hulk stated that he was open to returning in the film. The next month, executive producer Jon Favreau stated that he would not direct the film, but would [...] "definitely have input and a say". Favreau also expressed concerns, stating, [...] "It's going to be hard, because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man, and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero, and then with Avengers you're going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor... the two of those <b>works</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> in the comic books, but it's {{going to take a lot}} of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we've created". In March 2009, actress Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt in portraying Natasha Romanoff in Iron Man 2, a deal that subsequently attached her to The Avengers. The female superhero Wasp was included in an earlier draft of the script written before Johansson's involvement. The following day, Marvel announced that the film's release date had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost a full year later. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the film's cast in June, returning as Thor and Loki, respectively.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "A Christmas special in all but name, and a touching look at the relationship between Marge and her growing Bart." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times said that [...] "thanks to the keen eye of the writers and the rarely shown good side of Bart, this episode <b>works</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> as both an amusing insight to the way a child’s mind works and as a strong relationship building episode between Bart and Marge." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that despite {{being one of the}} [...] "sappier" [...] episodes at times, it [...] "still packs some terrific laughs". Jacobson commented that he [...] "absolutely lost it when Homer’s drawing of a robot grilling a hot dog was seen - it’s funnier if you see it - and Lawrence Tierney’s guest turn as the store detective adds hilarious grit to the show." [...] He added that the episode does not [...] "fall into the classic" [...] category, [...] "but it offers more than enough entertainment to satisfy". Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered {{the best part of the}} episode to be when a depressed Bart makes a snowman from the dirty, leftover snow under the car. She called the scene [...] "amazingly pathetic". Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B. In 2011, Richard Lawson of The Atlantic Wire cited it as the best Christmas episode of The Simpsons, noting that [...] "it's very sweet and there are some funny videogame jokes". He added that the episode [...] "features a terrific guest starring voice performance from the late Lawrence Tierney". Charlie Sweatpants, author of the online book Zombie Simpsons: How the Best Show Ever Became the Broadcasting Undead and creator of the blog Dead Homer Society, claims that it is the [...] "one bad episode" [...] in season seven, due to it being an example of a very special episode; however, he claims that it is only bad by the [...] "towering" [...] standards of the earlier seasons.|$|E

2500|$|In calcium {{chloride}} transformation, the cells are prepared by chilling {{cells in the}} presence of [...] (in [...] solution), making the cell become permeable to plasmid DNA. The cells are incubated on ice with the DNA, and then briefly heat-shocked (e.g., at 42°C for 30–120 seconds). [...] This method <b>works</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> for circular plasmid DNA. [...] Non-commercial preparations should normally give 106 to 107 transformants per microgram of plasmid; a poor preparation will be about 104/μg or less, but a good preparation of competent cells can give up to ~108 colonies per microgram of plasmid. Protocols, however, exist for making supercompetent cells that may yield a transformation efficiency of over 109. The chemical method, however, usually does not work well for linear DNA, such as fragments of chromosomal DNA, probably because the cell's native exonuclease enzymes rapidly degrade linear DNA. [...] In contrast, cells that are naturally competent are usually transformed more efficiently with linear DNA than with plasmid DNA.|$|E

60|$|As we {{had several}} of Napoleon's {{soldiers}} at dinner yesterday, {{and they had}} united to praise the military character of the position taken by the revellers, I was curious to examine it. The Rue St. Méry is narrow, and the houses are high. The tower {{of the church is}} a little advanced, so as to enfilade it, in a manner, and the paving-stones had been used to make barricades, as in 1830. These stones are much larger than our own, are angular, and of a size that <b>works</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> into a wall; and the materials being plenty, a breastwork, that is proof against everything but artillery, is soon formed by a crowd. Two streets entered the Rue St. Méry near each other, but not in a right line, so that the approach along each is commanded by the house that stands across its end. One of these houses {{appears to have been a}} citadel of the disaffected, and most of the fighting was at and near this spot. Artillery had been brought up against the house in question, which was completely riddled, though less injured by round-shot than one could have thought possible. The windows were broken, and the ceilings of the upper rooms were absolutely torn to pieces by musket-balls, that had entered on the rise. Some twenty or thirty dead were found in this dwelling.|$|E
60|$|Near {{the village}} are the coffee plantations. The trees are planted in rows, and are kept topped to about seven feet high. This causes the lateral {{branches}} to grow very strong, {{so that some}} of the trees become perfect hemispheres, loaded with fruit from top to bottom, and producing from ten to twenty pounds each of cleaned coffee annually. These plantations were all formed by the Government, and are cultivated by the villagers under the direction of their chief. Certain days are appointed for weeding or gathering, and the whole working population are summoned by the sound of a gong. An account is kept of the number of hours' work done by each family, and at the year's end, the produce of the sale is divided among them proportionately. The coffee is taken to Government stores established at central places over the whole country, and is paid for at a low fixed price. Out of this a certain percentage goes to the chiefs and majors, and the remainder is divided among the inhabitants. This system <b>works</b> <b>very</b> <b>well,</b> and I believe is at present far better for the people than free-trade would be. There are also large rice-fields, and in this little village of seventy houses, I was informed that a hundred pounds' worth of rice was sold annually.|$|E
