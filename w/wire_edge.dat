If I had I wouldn't be here to-night. You all know how many keepers of tame wild animals get killed. I could tell you dozens of tragedies. And I've often thought, since I got back from New York, of that woman I saw with her troop of African lions. I dream about those lions, and see them leaping over her head. What a grand sight that was! But the public is fooled. I read somewhere that she trained those lions by love. I don't believe it. I saw her use a whip and a steel spear. Moreover, I saw many things that escaped most observers--how she entered the cage, how she maneuvered among them, how she kept a compelling gaze on them! It was an admirable, a great piece of work. Maybe she loves those huge yellow brutes, but her life was in danger every moment while she was in that cage, and she knew it. Some day, one of her pets likely the King of Beasts she pets the most will rise up and kill her. That is as certain as death." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Commercially pure Al wires {{are drawn}} through equal channel angular dies with {{simultaneous}} torsion. The wires are deformed {{up to an}} equivalent strain of 1 to 4 at room temperature after several passes. The microstructure evolution of the wires is investigated using optical microscopy at both longitudinal and transverse cross sections. A grain refinement to a mean grain size of 10 to 15 µm is achieved by using this process. Finer grain structure is observed at the edge area of the wires due to the non-uniform strain distribution. The micro-hardness measurement indicates that the hardness distribution is inhomogeneous and increasing from a minimum value at the wire centre to a maximum value at the <b>wire</b> <b>edge.</b> Finite element (FE) results show that by using a channel angel of 160 ° and an initial wire diameter of 4 mm during one pass, an equivalent plastic strain of about 0. 4 at the wire centre and 0. 9 at the <b>wire</b> <b>edge</b> can be achieved. The most important advantage {{of this process is}} the ability to impose continuous severe plastic deformation to wires.

40|$|In {{wire and}} arc {{additive}} manufacture (WAAM), the twist of wire during a robot’s movement {{can result in}} the sudden changes of the wire-feeding position and thus cause deposition defects and dimensional errors.

The both approach give the same values of the magnetic fields corresponding to the successive subband depopulation and qualitatively similar evolution of the magnetosubbands.

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{demand for}} high-performance and low-power computing warrants {{an investigation of}} technologies beyond conventional digital transistor circuits. We explore a logic device based on magnetic domain walls, which are electrically movable boundaries between oppositely magnetized domains of a wire, for applications to hardware acceleration. A domain wall logic device takes current on the input, which moves a magnetic domain wall to a position in a ferromagnetic wire, and this position is the nonvolatile data token read as an output current through a magnetic tunnel junction. The spatial resolution of discrete magnetic domain wall positions in domain wall logic devices is studied to guide memory and logic applications. Theory, numerical modeling, and experiments on in-plane and perpendicularly magnetized materials demonstrate that the bit resolution, or analog information capacity, of a magnetic nanowire with a single domain wall {{is limited by the}} self-affine statistics of the <b>wire</b> <b>edge</b> roughness. The domain wall logic device is extended further into functional design implementations, including a logic-in-memory architecture to perform deep convolutional neural network operations in a hybrid process with magnetic devices and 45 nm CMOS. A 3 -terminal magnetic logic device is designed to have a 3 -bit resolution, and is used in conjunction with transistors in circuit designs for an ecient logic-in-memory system that can process convolutional neural networks 10 faster than conventional digital CMOS implementations. by Sumit Dutta.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. August 2015. Major: Physics. Advisor: Paul Crowell. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 118 pages. This thesis describes {{the dynamics of}} magnetic domain walls in two very different ferromagnetic systems. In one system, the magnetization prefers to lie in {{the plane of the}} film, which leads to relatively large and complex domain wall structures. In the other system, in which the magnetization is oriented out of the film plane, the domain walls are much smaller and simpler but are more susceptible to the influence of interface effects. In both cases, the dynamics of the domain walls are strongly influenced by the presence of defects, e. g. the inevitable edge and surface roughness of a patterned nanowire. In this dissertation, I explore the resonance dynamics of isolated and coupled transverse domain walls. I show that an intrinsic domain wall mode arises {{as a result of the}} pinning effects of the <b>wire</b> <b>edge</b> roughness, by comparing experimental results with micromagnetic simulations. Because of the strong pinning effects, the dynamics of coupled transverse domain walls are also influenced by the edge roughness, leading to the presence of two distinct modes. Using a simple onedimensional model, the domain wall separation dependence of the two resonant frequencies is explained. As edge roughness is unavoidable, I argue that stochastic pinning effects will be present in other DW resonance experiments. I also explore the propagation of a domain wall through a wire, driven under the influence of magnetic fields and electrical currents. The velocity of the domain wall is shown to follow a model where the domain wall moves via a succession of thermally-activated jumps between pinning sites in the wire. A current-to-field equivalence is established, and the nature of this equivalence is explored through the application of static magnetic fields in the plane of the film. These fields influence the internal structure of the domain wall and thus the torques generated by the current. From the symmetry of these torques, it is revealed that the application of a current leads to a spin-Hall effect in an adjacent non-magnetic layer in the film structure, which influences the domain wall dynamics. A nontrivial suppression of the current-to-field efficiency is observed under large in-plane fields, which is potentially linked to how the domain wall moves through a defect landscape...|$|E
40|$|Domain walls may {{be treated}} as single {{entities}} {{that can be used}} to convey bits of information in potential magnetic memory devices such as magnetic logic and racetrack memory, which use controlled domain wall movement in complex magnetic nanowire networks. Greater understanding and control over certain aspects of their behaviour is required, however, before such devices can be realised. The structure of magnetic domain walls in ferromagnetic nanowires is both material and geometry dependent, thus providing an extremely large parameter space to explore. The structure and control of magnetic domain walls in permalloy nanostructures is investigated throughout this thesis using static and pulsed magnetic fields in combination with deliberately fabricated pinning features using Lorentz microscopy. The effect of an abrupt corner on the structure of domain walls is investigated with the use of a castellated wire geometry. Two different domain wall structures are observed at the corners of the wire, and a completely different domain wall is observed in a straight segment of the wire. Additionally, the reversal behaviour observed is entirely different depending on the direction of the applied field. Reproducibility experiments are also performed to asses the suitability of this geometry for potential use in magnetic memory applications. The ability to control the behaviour of both vortex and transverse domain walls in nanowires with deliberately fabricated defects is also explored, using a range of domain wall nucleation techniques. The magnetic spin structure of a vortex domain wall is completely different from a transverse domain wall and as a result their interaction with deliberately fabricated pinning sites differs greatly. Both domain wall types possess a chirality or sense of rotation. In wider wires however, transverse domain walls also possess an asymmetry which acts as an additional degree of freedom in the interaction with a trap. The result of both increasing and decreasing the wire width on a domain wall is investigated by patterning a single or double notch or anti-notch along a permalloy wire. The propagation of a magnetic domain wall along both a gently tapered and straight wire under the application of a pulsed magnetic field is also investigated, where a distorted vortex domain wall structure is observed to form. The distance a domain wall travels following the application of a short field pulse is measured and a lower limit of the velocity is calculated. Additionally, a domain wall is observed to undergo a number of changes in structure and chirality as it is moved along a wire under pulsed fields. The <b>wire</b> <b>edge</b> roughness also has a significant effect on the domain wall propagation velocity and focused ion beam irradiation is utilised to smooth the wire edges.

5000|$|The final panel {{fabrication}} process, after {{achieving the}} correct surface contour, {{is some kind}} of edge treatment, such as flanging (sheet metal) or <b>wire</b> <b>edging.</b> This finishes and strengthens the edge. Typically, there is {{too much or too little}} metal in the flange, which pulls the panel out of shape after the flange is turned—so it must be stretched or shrunk to correct the surface shape. This is most easily done using Eckold shrinking and stretching, but can be done using heat shrinking or cold shrinking, by tucking and beating the tucked metal into itself, or by using a cold shrinking hammer and dolly. Stretching or shrinking the flange requires a correct profile hammer and dolly. The hammer and dolly must match the desired flange shape at the point of contact through the flange, (known as ringing the dolly) with the hammer. A lot of shrinking or stretching work hardens the flange and can cause cracks and tears. While these can be welded, it is much better to anneal the metal before this happens to restore its workability.|$|R

If magnetic field is perpendicular to the wire axis, pseudogaps are opened in energy dispersion relation E(k) what in conjunction with spin Zeeman shift of spin-up and spin-down subbands allows for quite high spin polarization of conductance.
