5|$|Despite his {{feud with}} Rivadavia, who was {{appointed}} President of Argentina, San Martín offered his military services in the War with Brazil, but received no response. He sailed to the country when Rivadavia was deposed and replaced by the federal Manuel Dorrego, and the war ended in the interim. He intended to return anyway, as a federal government would spare him the persecution he would otherwise have received from the unitarians. He was unable to do as he planned. When his ship docked in Río de Janeiro he <b>was</b> <b>informed</b> <b>that</b> the unitarian Juan Lavalle had deposed Dorrego, and when he reached Montevideo he <b>was</b> <b>informed</b> <b>that</b> Lavalle had captured and executed Dorrego and begun a campaign of terror against all federals in the country. The ship arrived in Buenos Aires, but San Martín did not leave it, instead returning to Montevideo. Lavalle was unable {{to put down the}} federal rebellion against him, and offered San Martín the government. San Martín declined and returned to Brussels.|$|E
