5|$|Cape {{sold the}} US {{rights to the}} {{recently}} formed publishing house of Pascal Covici and Donald Friede. Friede had heard gossip about The Well at a party at Theodore Dreiser's house and immediately decided to acquire it. He had previously sold a copy of Dreiser's An American Tragedy to a Boston police officer to create a censorship test case, which he had lost; he was awaiting an appeal, which he would also lose. He took out a $10,000 bank loan to outbid another publisher which had offered a $7,500 advance, and enlisted Morris Ernst, co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, to defend the book against legal challenges. Friede invited John Saxton Sumner of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice to buy a copy directly from him, to ensure that he, not a bookseller, {{would be the one}} prosecuted. He also travelled to Boston to give a copy to the Watch and Ward Society, hoping both to further challenge censorship of literature and to generate more publicity; he was disappointed <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> him they saw nothing wrong with the book.|$|E

I was depressed because I lost a good job, but I just didn't miss it. Maybe it was the routine of it every week I didn't miss, but I {{have a lot of}} good memories of doing that strip.|$|E

2500|$|First Man made {{bows and}} arrows for the twins, and they {{traveled}} to the south to hunt. [...] They saw a large black bird on a tree, and tried to hit it with an arrow, but it flew away. [...] <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> Changing Woman this, she said, [...] "That was Raven, and {{he may be a}} spy for , the Monster Bird, who devours our people. [...] Do not go there again." [...] The following day the boys took their bows and headed west. [...] They saw a large black bird with a red head, and tried to kill it, but it flew away. [...] <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> Changing Woman this, she said, [...] "That was Vulture. [...] He may be a spy for , the Monster that Kicks People Down Cliffs. [...] Do not go there again." [...] The next day they boys traveled north, and there they saw a black and white bird with a piercing voice. [...] They tried to shoot it with their arrows, but it flew away. [...] <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> their mother, she said, [...] "That was Magpie. [...] He is a spy for , the Monster Who Kills With His Eyes. [...] If he sees you he will paralyze you with his eyes and peck you to pieces." [...] Changing Woman cried, [...] "Now the monsters know about you, and they will come to kill you.

2500|$|In 2009, Im Tirtzu's largest donor was the John Hagee Ministries (JHM) via the Christian-Zionist {{organization}} Christians United for Israel (CUFI). Im Tirtzu received US$100,000 from JHM and $34,000 {{from other}} sources. In 2010, The Jerusalem Post reported that JHM [...] "expressed deep displeasure" [...] with Im Tirtzu after its campaigns against the New Israel Fund and Ben-Gurion University and announced {{the cessation of}} its funding. A JHM spokesman said that Im Tirtzu [...] "misrepresented its focus <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> us their mission was strictly Zionist education".|$|E
2500|$|The Los Angeles Times interviewed {{longtime}} Owens spokesman (and Buckaroos keyboard player) Jim Shaw, {{who said}} Owens [...] "had {{come to the}} club early and had a chicken fried steak dinner and bragged that it's his favorite meal." [...] Afterward, Owens told band members that he wasn't feeling well {{and was going to}} skip that night's performance. Shaw said a group of fans introduced themselves while Owens was preparing to drive home; <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> him that they had traveled from Oregon to hear him perform, Owens changed his mind and took the stage anyway.|$|E

2500|$|The Twins {{figured they}} had a 50–50 chance of losing Breslow when they placed him on waivers in May 2009 to clear space on their 25-man roster for fellow {{left-hander}} Sean Henn. [...] Oakland needed bullpen help and claimed Breslow before his 72-hour waiver period expired. [...] Had he cleared, the Twins could have sent him to Triple-A Rochester. [...] "We were hoping to keep him", said assistant general manager Rob Antony. [...] "We lost a bullpen guy without trying to lose a bullpen guy", manager Ron Gardenhire said. [...] "I kind of got shocked <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Verna is the matriarch of the Sawyer family. According to Taylor, [...] "What {{attracted}} me to Leatherface {{was really}} {{talking with the}} directors. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> me {{they wanted to do}} something that was a cross between Terrence Malick, like Badlands, and The Virgin Suicides, I thought 'I'm there' because what I love is this stuff that's happening with people pushing a genre as far as they could push it and it's exciting to me." [...] Taylor chose to concentrate more on Verna's maternal instincts for her family than her murderous ways, with the character having a denial or compartmentalization about her motherhood and the murder. The film reunites Taylor with Stephen Dorff, who both starred in the 1996 film I Shot Andy Warhol.|$|E
2500|$|Alonso {{believed}} {{the timing of}} the safety car and not a strategy error prevented him from achieving a podium finish, saying if Ferrari had Mercedes's pace, they would remain on track: [...] "The moment of the safety car was probably not good, but sometimes it helps and sometimes it doesn't help. Today it didn't help." [...] Ferrari team principal Marco Mattiacci defended his team's strategy and did not believe anything specific prevented his team from finishing on the podium: [...] "Definitely the safety car didn't do any better for us, but the race is made of 60 laps. We squeezed the car as much as we could; the strategy from the pits was excellent. There were other variables we know we cannot control. We did our best." [...] Boullier suggested Red Bull used coded messages to assist Ricciardo <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> Ricciardo to remain off the kerbing but stressed it was the FIA's task to investigate. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner spoke to Whiting for clarification because Ricciardo had battery damage from going over the kerbing. The sport's governing body confirmed they were satisfied with Red Bull's radio messages and stated the team abided by the regulations.|$|E

500|$|Robert Ford, a {{political}} scientist at the University of Manchester, reported on a YouGov survey on partisan reactions to the Downing Street cats. Participants in the survey were shown a picture of Humphrey, the Chief Mouser appointed by Margaret Thatcher, and told that he was either Thatcher's cat or Tony Blair's cat. Affinity for the cat divided along partisan lines: Conservative voters liked the cat far more <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were <b>told</b> he was Thatcher's and Labour voters liked the cat far more <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were <b>told</b> he was Blair's. Ford concludes that partisanship shapes reactions to everything a politician does, however trivial, similar to the halo effect (and a reverse [...] "forked tail effect") observed by psychologists.|$|R

2500|$|Kenseth {{started out}} his {{season with a}} {{promising}} race in the Daytona 500. He led 40 laps in the waning stages in the race. He took the white flag to start the final lap, but was passed by teammate Denny Hamlin and Martin Truex, Jr.. Kenseth's attempt at blocking backfired as he went sideways and lost several positions. Kenseth finished 14th while Hamlin edged Truex to the stripe to win the closest finish in the race's history. One week later in the Atlanta race, he was tagged for [...] "improper fueling" [...] during a green flag pit stop {{and was forced to}} serve a pass-through penalty. He was given the black flag with the white cross marks for not pitting within three laps. After serving that penalty, he ended up in 31st two-laps down. After the race, he said [...] "I got black-flagged for some type of pit road penalty and I didn’t know it and pitted the lap they told me to do a pass through – I'm assuming they were black flagging us before that and they pulled our card. I never heard anything about it or at least saw the flag or anything, so I came <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> me to come and I guess they must have penalized us a couple laps or something. I don’t really know. I haven’t really seen it.” However, Kenseth did go on to finish 19th. He finished 37th at Las Vegas after being involved in a multi-car wreck with Chase Elliott, Kurt Busch, and Carl Edwards late in the race.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{tropical}} oysters, {{such as the}} mangrove oyster in {{the family}} Ostreidae, grow best on mangrove roots. Low tide can expose them, making them easy to collect.

40|$|Participants {{were told}} to form an {{impression}} of either a liberal or a conservative target person whose behaviors reflected both a liberal and a conservative social ideology. They had better recall of behaviors that were descriptively inconsistent (vs. consistent) with the target`s ideology when this ideology differed from their own. This was not true, however, when the target`s ideology was similar to theirs. In addition, participants had better recall of behaviors they personally considered to be undesirable. This latter difference was more pronounced among liberals <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were <b>told</b> to focus their attention on the opinions reflected by the behaviors described {{but it was more}} pronounced among conservatives <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were <b>told</b> to focus on the behaviors per se.
