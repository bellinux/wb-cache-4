Just before he leaves, the dragon stops him and requests his aid in removing the brotherhood's hold upon her, claiming they are using her for evil and are planning to make her go on a major rampage.|$|E

One way of calculating the water content is to transform the reflectivities in rain rate at all levels in the clouds and to sum it up.

If the cloud would rain out completely, it would be the amount of rain falling on the ground and one can estimate with VIL the potential for flash flood.|$|E
