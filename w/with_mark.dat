40|$|A 3 -manifold <b>with</b> <b>marked</b> {{boundary}} {{is a pair}} (M, X), where M is {{a compact}} 3 -manifold whose (possibly empty) boundary {{is made up of}} tori and Klein bottles, and X is a trivalent graph that is a spine of ∂M. A standard skeleton of a 3 -manifold <b>with</b> <b>marked</b> boundary (M, X) is a standard sub-polyhedron P of M such that P ∩∂M coincides with X and with ∂P, and such that P ∪ ∂M is a spine of M B (where B is a ball). In this paper, we will prove that the classical set of moves for standard spines of 3 -manifolds (i. e. the MP-move and the V-move) does not suffice to relate any two standard skeleta of a 3 -manifold <b>with</b> <b>marked</b> boundary to each other. We will also describe a condition on the 3 -manifold <b>with</b> <b>marked</b> boundary that tells whether the generalised set of moves, made up of the MP-move and the L-move, suffices to relate any two standard skeleta of the 3 -manifold <b>with</b> <b>marked</b> boundary to each other. For the 3 -manifolds <b>with</b> <b>marked</b> boundary that do not fulfil this condition, we give two other moves: the CR-move and the T-move. The first one is local and, with the MP-move and the L-move, suffices to relate to each other any two standard skeleta of a 3 -manifold <b>with</b> <b>marked</b> boundary fulfilling another condition. For the universal case, we will prove that the non-local T-move, with the MP-move and the L-move, suffices to relate to each other any two standard skeleta of a generic 3 -manifold <b>with</b> <b>marked</b> boundary. As a corollary, we will get that disc-replacements suffice to relate to each other any two standard skeleta of a 3 -manifold <b>with</b> <b>marked</b> boundary...|$|R
