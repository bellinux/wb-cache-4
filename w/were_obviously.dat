5|$|Secord's {{fears were}} justified, as USAF {{reconnaissance}} aircraft regularly flying over northeastern Laos in 1967 {{revealed that the}} paved roads constructed by the North Vietnamese <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> approaching Phou Pha Thi. Road constructing activities were observed along Routes 6 and 19, which connected Dien Bien Phu in North Vietnam with Phou Pha Thi and Nam Bac in Laos.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{concluded}} that the conflict of interest materialized in a few ways. First, Stewart declined to cross-examine one of the witnesses, who could implicate Kretske but not Glasser, for fear that it would strengthen the case against Kretske. Stewart also failed to object to the testimony of other witnesses regarding prior statements of Kretske; under the rules of hearsay, these statements <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> admissible against Kretske, but less obviously admissible against Glasser without a predicate showing that Glasser was a co-conspirator. Stewart feared that an objection only on behalf of Glasser would highlight the admissibility of the statements against Kretske.|$|E
25|$|During {{the visits}} from lawyers and, more rarely, {{relatives}} (friends {{were not allowed}}), three jailers were observing the conversations the prisoners had with their visitors. The prisoners {{were not allowed to}} meet each other inside the prison, until late 1975 when a regular meeting time was established (30 minutes, twice per day), during which they <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> guarded.|$|E

25|$|The Caledonian line {{remained}} separate, {{and later}} a serious competitor, but the E and the NBR <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> complementary. The North Bridge station was extremely rudimentary at first and the two companies collaborated in improving it and making a shared station, and it was later renamed Waverley Station. Nonetheless the site was extremely cramped and for many years the accommodation was notoriously inadequate.|$|E
25|$|In May 1937, the Commission of Inquiry {{into the}} Charges Made against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials, {{commonly}} known as the Dewey Commission, was set up in the United States by supporters of Trotsky, to establish the truth about the trials. The commission was headed by the noted American philosopher and educator John Dewey. Although the hearings <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> conducted with a view to proving Trotsky's innocence, they brought to light evidence which established that some of the specific charges made at the trials could not be true.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{official}} figures <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> flawed regarding {{the size of}} the crowd (15,000–20,000), the number of rounds fired and the period of shooting, the Indian National Congress instituted a separate inquiry of its own, with conclusions that differed considerably from the British Government's so-called inquiry. The casualty number quoted by the Congress was more than 1,500, with approximately 1,000 being killed. The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919.|$|E

25|$|Oceaan 7 {{was very}} small for the purpose to which it was being put. The cramped living {{accommodation}} and lack of privacy on board soon caused tensions among the personnel. It proved difficult to maintain the vessel in position off Scarborough as the winter storms came. In November 1966 one storm was so severe that waves were breaking over the vessel's deck and water entered the living quarters and studio. The station carried on broadcasting through {{the early part of}} the storm although the presenters <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> in fear for their lives. Listeners on-shore (including 270 staff member Paul Burnett) were horrified by what was happening. In the aftermath of the storm, the station went off the air for 8 days while repairs were carried out.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the mysteries}} about Leptictidium is whether it moved by running or by jumping. Because {{there are very few}} {{completely}} bipedal mammals, it is difficult to find an appropriate living model to compare it with. If the kangaroo is used, it is probable that Leptictidium hopped along with its body tilted forward, using its tail as a counterweight. On the other hand, elephant shrews combine both types of locomotion; they usually move on four legs, but they can run on two legs to flee from a predator. Studies of the bone structure of Leptictidium have yielded contradicting information: its leg articulations appear too weak to have supported the shock of repeated jumps, but its long feet <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> adapted for jumping rather than running.|$|E
25|$|Strabo {{locates the}} Moschoi in two places. The first {{location}} is somewhere in modern Abkhazia (Georgia) {{on the eastern}} shore of the Black Sea, in agreement with Stephan of Byzantium quoting Hellanicus. The second location Moschice (Moschikê) – in which was a temple of Leucothea, once famous for its wealth, but plundered by Pharnaces and Mithridates – was divided between the Colchians, Armenians, and Iberians (cf. Mela, III. 5.4; Pliny VI.4.). These latter Moschoi <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> the Georgian Meskhi or Mesx’i (where Greek χ, chi, is Georgian ხ, x). Procopius calls them Meschoi and says that they were subject to the Iberians (i.e., Georgians), and had embraced Christianity, the religion of their masters. According to Professor James R. Russell of Harvard University, the Georgian designation for Armenians Somekhi, preserves the old name of the Mushki.|$|E

25|$|Green's mid-1860s Newmarket {{premises}} were in Station Road, {{very near}} where it joins the High Street. They <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> very extensive as they included a vast half-mile wide straw-bed circle which, in hard frosts, other trainers (Blanton, Godding and J Wood are mentioned) he allowed to use. But Green's Newmarket premises were {{put up for}} sale at the White Hart Inn on the 13 February 1868 by auctioneer Ebenezer Feist and presumably he, as a quarterly tenant, was obliged to move to other premises in Newmarket at that point. Further details of the property are given though – a dwelling house with enclosed court yard, stalls and loose boxes for sixteen horses, hay, corn and straw chambers, carriage houses and an ample supply of spring water, within a short distance of the railway station.|$|E
25|$|In 1901 Balmont and Lokhvitskaya met, apparently, for {{the last}} time. Since then their {{relationship}} has been confined to enigmatically constructed poetic dialogues, full of demands and threats on his part and pleas for mercy on hers. Apparently both were taking their shared self-created world of horror and passion seriously. Balmont was continuously complaining in his letters of being 'possessed', while Lokhvitskaya submerged herself in a quagmire of violent visions which, coupled with feelings of guilt towards her family, might have led to an illness the roots of which <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> psychosomatic. Some (Alexandrova included) regard the involvement of Valery Bryusov, Balmont's close rival/friend {{to be the most}} damaging factor. The well-publicized fact that Bryusov (who hated Lokhvitskaya, thinking she was trying to 'steal' a friend of his) dabbled in black magic added a gothic touch to the whole affair.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{his life}} Mark Finch was boyishly charming and often masked his private {{depression}} with public bonhomie. His gently camp affectation would occasionally dissolve into tantrum socially but such outbursts {{were not part}} of his professional life, which was characterised by lively industry, incisive wit and a passionate affability. He delighted in wordplay and inventive imagery; he never stopped writing absurd narratives, and sharp observations of his surroundings. Such commentaries were sent to friends in small packages with brief covering notes or topped and tailed with the greetings and codas of more formal letters. Soon after his birthday each year after his first arrival in London he would often create an inventive calendar collage for the coming year. Similar publications became commercial products in the mid-1990s but Finch's creations <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> amateur and intensely personal. They were photocopied, spiral-bound and mailed to friends as pre-Christmas gifts.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, wearing plain {{dress was}} {{an answer to}} a number of Friends' concerns. Expensive styles were used to show social {{inequality}} and make statements about wealth. Only a select few could afford expensive adornments, which could then be used to exacerbate differences between people based on class, where people in fancy clothing would not want to be seen socializing with others dressed tattily. This was part of the inspiration for the Quaker testimony to equality. In addition, the frequent buying of expensive new styles and discarding what had recently been bought, was considered wasteful and self-seeking, where Friends instead aimed to focus on simplicity, and the important things in life. Notably, Friends did not consider it right to judge people on their material possessions, but this could not be achieved in a society which placed an emphasis on keeping up to date with inconsequential but expensive new trends. At the time, this practice of plainness meant Friends <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> identifiable.|$|E
25|$|The fall of Jerusalem {{and almost}} the whole Holy Land after the Battle of Hattin {{came as a}} terrible blow to the Christian world. Raymond's {{alliance}} with Saladin and his escape from the battlefield aroused suspicion and many Christian writers regarded him a traitor. About 60 years after the events, Alberic of Trois-Fontaines claimed that Raymond and Saladin sanctioned their alliance through drinking each other's blood. The Minstrel of Reims believed that Saladin reminded Raymond about his oath {{to persuade him to}} leave the battlefield at the Horns of Hattin. Robert of Auxerre, William of Nangis and other medieval European historians even accused Raymond of apostasy, insisting that he had been circumcised shortly before God killed him for his betrayal. Muslim historians also knew that the Christians thought that Raymond had converted, or at least wanted to convert to Islam. Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani wrote that Raymond had not convert only because he was afraid of his co-religionists. Modern historians agree that the stories about Raymond's conversion <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> invented.|$|E
25|$|There were {{considerable}} {{difficulties in}} the operation of the contracts and the management of the men. During the period 1870–1875, power gradually transferred from the Provinces to the central government, partly because of the railway question. The Bill to abolish the Provinces was carried in October 1875 and implemented a year later. However, in the interim {{it was very difficult for}} Brogdens to get clear prompt decisions. Brogdens got less work than they had hoped and it became available more slowly than expected. Communications between UK and New Zealand <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> slow so it was difficult to know how many men to send at any given time. Sometimes Brogdens could not find work for the men when they arrived. Men reneged on their promissory notes. There were disputes over working hours, wages and whether they should be paid when the weather stopped the work. Gradually the men drifted away. By August 1873, 2172 English immigrants had been brought out. They included 1299 working-age men who were contracted to work for Brogdens for two years but only 287 of them were still working for them. Most of the men were agricultural labourers, rather than true navvies and they found local agricultural labour and working conditions more attractive than navvy work.|$|E

25|$|Politics again intervened at Munich in 1972, with lethal consequences. A Palestinian {{terrorist}} group named Black September invaded the Olympic village and {{broke into the}} apartment of the Israeli delegation. They killed two Israelis and held 9 others as hostages. The terrorists demanded that Israel release numerous prisoners. When the Israeli government refused their demand, a tense stand-off ensued while negotiations continued. Eventually the captors, still holding their hostages, were offered safe passage and taken to an airport, where they were ambushed by German security forces. In the firefight that followed, 15 people, including the nine Israeli athletes and five of the terrorists, were killed. After much debate, {{it was decided that}} the Games would continue, but proceedings <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> dominated by these events. Some memorable athletic achievements did occur during these Games, notably the winning of a then-record seven gold medals by United States swimmer Mark Spitz, Lasse Virén (of Finland)'s back-to-back gold in the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters (defeating American distance running great Steve Prefontaine in the former), and the winning of three gold medals by 16-year-old Soviet gymnastic sensation Olga Korbut - who thrilled the world with an historic backflip off the high bar. Korbut, however, failed to win the all-around, losing to her teammate Ludmilla Tourischeva.|$|E
500|$|While these {{ceramics}} <b>were</b> <b>obviously</b> recovered as grave goods, {{there is}} a question of whether they were specifically created for a mortuary rite, or whether they were used prior to burial, perhaps by the deceased.

[...] Some Buddhist temples, such as Toyokawa Inari, maintained Inari worship by arguing that they had always been devoted to a Buddhist deity (often Dakiniten), which the common folk had mistaken as Inari.|$|E
