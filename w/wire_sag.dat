40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method of}} determining the <b>wire</b> <b>sag</b> in a multiwire proportional chamber used in RICH (ALICE) by solving the second order differential equation which governs the wire stability has been presented. The three point Finite Difference Method (FDM) has generated a tridiagonal matrix equation relating the deflection of wire segments to the force acting on it. The precise estimates of electrostatic force has been obtained from accurate field computation using a nearly exact Boundary Element Method (neBEM) solver.

The precision muon detector is made of monitored drift tubes with tracking precision better than 50 mum to measure the muon track sagitta in the toroidal magnetic field. A world-wide intensive construction work of the ATLAS muon detector is under way.

40|$|The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is {{evaluating}} {{the feasibility of}} placing a free electron laser (FEL) {{at the end of}} the linear accelerator. The proposal is to inject electrons two thirds of the way down the linac, accelerate the electrons for the last one third of the linac, and then send the electrons into the FEL. This project is known as the LCLS (Linac Coherent Light Source). To test the feasibility of the LCLS, a smaller experiment VISA (Visual to Infrared SASE (Self Amplified Stimulated Emission) Amplifier) is being performed at Brookhaven National Laboratory. VISA consists of four wiggler segments, each 0. 99 m long. The four segments are required to be aligned to the beam axis with an rms error less than 50 {micro}m [1]. This very demanding alignment is carried out in two steps [2]. First the segments are fiducialized using a pulsed wire system. Then the wiggler segments are placed along a reference laser beam which coincides with the electron beam axis. In the wiggler segment fiducialization, a wire is stretched through a wiggler segment and a current pulse is sent down the wire. The deflection of the wire is monitored. The deflection gives information about the electron beam trajectory. The wire is moved until its x position, the coordinate without <b>wire</b> <b>sag,</b> is on the ideal beam trajectory. (The y position is obtained by rotating the wiggler 90 {sup o}.) Once the wire is on the ideal beam trajectory, the wire's location is measured relative to tooling balls on the wiggler segment. To locate the wire, a device was constructed which measures the wire position relative to tooling balls on the device. The device is called the wire finder. It will be discussed in this paper. To place the magnets along the reference laser beam, the position of the laser beam must be determined. A device which can locate the laser beam relative to tooling balls was constructed and is also discussed in this paper. This device is called the laser finder. With a total alignment error budget less than 50 {micro}m, both the fiducialization and magnet placement must be performed with errors much smaller than 50 {micro}m. It is desired to keep the errors from the wire finder and laser finder at the few {micro}m level...|$|E
50|$|The {{practical}} {{limit to}} the length of a tensioned cutting wire is the tendency of the <b>wire</b> to <b>sag</b> under the force of gravity, which requires higher tension for longer wires. Some CNC cutting machines place the ends of the wire above and below the workpiece, with the wire being mostly vertical, to counter this problem.|$|R

They found tin and oil and more copper. Then, by slow stages, they passed on to a land of great grassy plains, of blue grass, {{miles and miles of}} it, and suddenly one day they came to the telegraph posts, rough pine trees unstripped of their bark, with a few <b>sagging</b> <b>wires.</b> Tavernake looked at them as Robinson Crusoe might have looked at Man Friday's footsteps.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. An accurate determination and characterization of electric and magnetic fields produced by power lines is a complex task. Different models must be used for far fields and for near fields. This study is centered on computation and measurement aspects of extremely low frequency magnetic fields in the direct proximity of the conductors of power lines, situated well above the ground level. Conventional approximation of a <b>sagged</b> <b>wire</b> as a straight horizontal conductor of infinite length has been substituted with a periodical catenary model of the conductors A series of measurements performed with all electric utility bucket truck provide unique magnetic field data very close to the conductors.

6000|$|There {{had been}} talk of mono-rails for several years. But the real {{mischief}} began when Brennan sprang his gyroscopic mono-rail car upon the Royal Society. It {{was the leading}} sensation of the 1907 soirees; that celebrated demonstration-room was all too small for its exhibition. Brave soldiers, leading Zionists, deserving novelists, noble ladies, congested the narrow passage and thrust distinguished elbows into ribs the world would not willingly let break, deeming themselves fortunate if they could see [...] "just {{a little bit of}} the rail." [...] Inaudible, but convincing, the great inventor expounded his discovery, and sent his obedient little model of the trains of the future up gradients, round curves, and across a <b>sagging</b> <b>wire.</b> It ran along its single rail, on its single wheels, simple and sufficient; it stopped, reversed stood still, balancing perfectly. It maintained its astounding equilibrium amidst a thunder of applause. The audience dispersed at last, discussing how far they would enjoy crossing an abyss on a wire cable. [...] "Suppose the gyroscope stopped!" [...] Few of them anticipated a tithe of what the Brennan mono-rail would do for their railway securities and the face of the world.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLightning stroke {{causes a}} current {{injection}} into transmission {{lines at the}} point of contact. The lightning performance can be difficult to understand without using simulation programs. PSCAD a powerful software was selected to develop the appropriate data required to investigate this phenomena. In this paper, two points along transmission line are selected for studying voltage–time (V–t) characteristics when any of those points is subjected to lightning strokes separately. The first assumed point is taken when lightning current is injected to the shielding wire {{at the top of the}} transmission tower, while, the other assumed point is taken when surge current is injected to the shielding <b>wire</b> at maximum <b>sag</b> location in the mid-span between two towers. The sag of transmission line has been newly developed and simulated using PSCAD. Both transmission line containing sag as well as lightning injection current are modeled. Fast transient of flashover as well as back flashover occurrence is investigated. The results revealed that the sag of transmission line has considerable influence on flashover and induced voltages across line insulators and phase lines as well. The influence of connecting surge arrester in substations is investigated. A proper transmission line arrester (TLA) is designed in order to minimize the occurrences of overvoltages due to flashover and consequently back flashover across insulators...|$|R
