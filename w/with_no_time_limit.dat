Toyota's retirement event featured a series of one-minute time limit matches, which Toyota finished {{with a record of}} 12 wins, 29 draws and 10 losses. Toyota then had her retirement match <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> against her hand-picked successor, Tsukasa Fujimoto, which she won with the Japanese Ocean Cyclone Suplex. However, Toyota demanded a rematch and went on to defeat Fujimoto again with the Japanese Ocean Queen Bee Bomb. Toyota and Fujimoto then had a third match, where Fujimoto was victorious with Toyota's own Japanese Ocean Cyclone Suplex, bringing Toyota's thirty-year career to an end.|$|E

On May 9, [...] "Hacksaw" [...] Jim Duggan pinned Papa Shango on Wrestling Challenge to become the fourth entrant. The following night, Bam Bam Bigelow qualified by defeating Typhoon on a live episode of Monday Night Raw. On the May 15 episode of WWF Superstars, Tatanka faced Giant Gonzalez in a qualifying match. Gonzalez choked his opponent and was disqualified by referee Bill Alfonso - whom Gonzalez attacked after the match; as a result, Tatanka advanced to the next round of the tournament. Mr. Perfect and Doink the Clown wrestled three qualifying matches against each other, before a decisive winner could be found to advance in the tournament. They first faced each other on the May 1 episode of WWF Superstars, but the match was declared a draw when the time limit expired. Their next match took place on the May 16 episode of Wrestling Challenge and again resulted in time-limit draw. On the May 24 episode of Monday Night Raw, a third match between the two was ordered, this time <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit,</b> and Perfect pinned Doink to advance to the seventh spot in the quarter-finals.

500|$|His illness {{meant that}} Larwood missed the second Test, at Lord's, which saw Australia score a record 729 for 6 {{including}} a rapid 254 from Bradman, {{at the time}} the highest individual Test score in England. Australia won the game by seven wickets, to draw level 1–1 in the five-match series. Larwood returned to the England side for the third Test, at Headingley, Leeds. He later claimed that his first ball to Bradman, before the batsman had scored, was a bouncer that touched the edge of the bat and was caught by the wicket-keeper, George Duckworth: [...] "You could hear the snick all over the ground". The umpire, however, gave Bradman not out. [...] Bradman went on to compile 334, beating his record score of two weeks earlier. Larwood's one wicket in the Australian innings cost 139 runs; England were saved from probable defeat when the game was shortened by rain. The England selectors dropped Larwood from the team for the fourth Test, in which Bradman was limited to 14 runs, but the game was rained off after just over two days' play. Larwood was recalled for the final Test at the Oval that, as in 1926, would determine the series victor. In a game <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit,</b> Australia replied to England's 405 with 695 (Bradman 232), then dismissed England for 251 to win by an innings and 39 runs. Larwood's single wicket—Bradman, {{for the first time in}} Tests—cost 132 runs. In the three Tests in which he played, Larwood took 4 wickets for 292; Bradman, he admitted, had [...] "pasted me unmercifully". Commentators recognised the danger that Bradman presented to English hopes; the former England bowler Percy Fender, who was captain of Surrey and a respected cricket journalist, was convinced that [...] "something new will have to be introduced to curb Bradman". Warner was explicit: [...] "England must evolve a new type of bowler and develop fresh ideas and strange tactics to curb his almost uncanny skill".|$|E

5000|$|Even though nikah mut'ah is {{prohibited}} by Sunni schools of law, {{several types of}} innovative marriage exist, including misyar (ambulant) and ʿurfi (customary) marriage. Some regard misyar as being comparable to nikah mut'ah: {{for the sole purpose}} of [...] "sexual gratification in a licit manner". Sunnis dismiss these claims as nothing more than Shia polemics. Nikah misyar, they argue, unlike mut'ah is not temporary but a permanent marriage <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> The difference between a normal marriage and misyar marriage is that in misyar the man and woman forego certain rights temporarily until both partners choose to reinstate them.

Methods: We performed a systematic review and search of the PubMed, ISI and PsycInfo scientific databases, <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> using the following key words: cognitive, function, panic, and disorder. Of the 971 articles found, 25 were selected and 17 were included in this review. The inclusion criterion was at least one neuropsychological assessment task in patients with panic disorder. Results: The number of publications has grown gradually, especially those assessing executive functions, corresponding to the neurobiological model most widely accepted. Of all the functions evaluated, these patients had lower performance in memory tasks and higher performance in affective processing tasks related to the disorder. However, these data require further investigation due to the high rate of comorbidities, the small sample sizes of the included studies and little standardization of instruments used.

Passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) in 1996 marked the most far-reaching reform of the U. S. welfare system since the 1930 s.

40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) and asthma represent {{a substantial portion}} of primary care practice. In adults, differentiating asthma from COPD can be difficult but is important because of the marked differences in treatment, disease progression, and outcomes between the 2 conditions. Currently, clinical COPD is often misdiagnosed or undiagnosed until late in the disease. Earlier diagnosis could markedly reduce morbidity and improve quality of life. Establishing a diagnosis of COPD requires spirometry testing, interpreted {{in the context of the}} patient's symptoms, smoking status, age, and comorbidities. Additional tests and tools may be helpful in the differential diagnosis, including questionnaires specifically developed to discriminate between COPD and asthma and, in special cases, imaging studies. Follow-up and monitoring of asthma and COPD are always necessary and provide additional benefit in patients in whom only continued care and reassessment can confirm the final diagnosis, such as younger individuals with fixed airway obstruction, smokers with asthma, and patients with both disorders. Key areas for improvement include enhanced case identification, improved quality and interpretation of findings on spirometry, and increased use of tools such as differential diagnosis questionnaires and algorithms to guide the diagnostic and monitoring process. To achieve optimal outcomes, the primary care team should make every effort to establish a firm diagnosis. For this review, we conducted a PubMed search <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> using the Medical Subject Headings chronic obstructive {{pulmonary disease}} or COPD and asthma, in association with the following search terms: diagnosis, differential diagnosis, mixed or comorbid disease, diagnostic techniques, spirometry, questionnaires, and primary care...|$|R
40|$|Planet Mars past {{environmental}} conditions {{were similar to}} the early Earth, but nowadays they {{are similar to those}} of a very cold desert, irradiated by intense solar UV light. However, some terrestrial lifeform showed the capability to adapt to very harsh environments, similar to the extreme condition of the Red Planet. In addition, recent discoveries of water in the Martian permafrost and of methane in the Martian atmosphere, have generated optimism regarding a potentially active subsurface Mars' biosphere. These findings increase the possibility of finding traces of life on a planet like Mars. However, before landing on Mars with dedicated biological experiments, it is necessary to understand the possibilities of finding life in the present Martian conditions. Finding a lifeform able to survive in Martian environment conditions may have a double meaning: increasing the hope of discovering extraterrestrial life and defining the limits for a terrestrial contamination of planet Mars. In this paper we present the Martian environment simulators LISA and mini-LISA, operating at the Astronomical Observatory of Padua, Italy. They have been designed to simulate the conditions on the surface of planet Mars (atmospheric pressure, 0. 6 - 0. 9 kPa; temperature from - 120 to 20 °C, Martian-like atmospheric composition and UV radiation).
