25|$|Khomeini {{served as}} leader of the {{revolution}} or as Supreme Leader of Iran from 1979 to his death on June 3, 1989. This era was dominated by the consolidation of the revolution into a theocratic republic under Khomeini, and by the costly and bloody <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Saddam's endless <b>wars</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq's</b> {{neighbours}} and his genocidal {{campaigns against}} his own people are bizarrely seen {{by many in the}} west as part of an era of [...] "stability" [...] and [...] "security" [...] for Iraqis. Stability imposed with chemical weapons and security achieved with mass graves. We would need to stretch the definition of those words beyond reason and meaning before we could ever apply them to pre-2003 Iraq. Hayder al-Khoei ...|$|R

In making the argument, the thesis considers the Holy See's role in international relations; the development of modern Catholic social teaching since Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical, Rerum Novarum; and case studies of John Paul II's diplomacy with respect to Israel, Lebanon, and the <b>wars</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq...</b>|$|R
25|$|As {{part of the}} Iran–Contra affair, Israel and Argentina {{collaborated with}} the United States to send arms to Iran to assist in arming Nicaraguan contras. Transporte Aéreo Rioplatense, which was {{revealed}} to be operated by high-ranking officials in the Argentine Air Force, transported military equipment from Israel to Iran, {{in support of the}} latter during its <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E
25|$|Clarke came to {{widespread}} public attention {{for his role}} as counter-terrorism czar in the Clinton and Bush administrations in March 2004, when he appeared on the 60 Minutes television news magazine, released his memoir about his service in government, Against All Enemies, and testified before the 9/11 Commission. In all three instances, Clarke was sharply critical of the Bush administration's attitude toward counter-terrorism before the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and of the decision to go to <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq.</b>|$|E
25|$|Though {{some critics}} charged that Jewish {{interests}} were partially {{responsible for the}} push to <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq,</b> Jewish Americans were actually more strongly opposed to the Iraq war from its onset than any other religious group, or even most Americans. The greater {{opposition to the war}} was not simply a result of high Democratic identification among U.S. Jews, as Jews of all political persuasions were more likely to oppose the war than non-Jews who shared the same political leanings.|$|E

The U.S. Park Police, which oversees activities on the National Mall, stopped providing estimates of crowd size after being threatened with lawsuits by {{the organizers of the}} Million Man March, but said that protest organizers only had a permit for 30,000 demonstrators.|$|E
25|$|On January 18, anti-war demonstrations, {{focusing}} particularly but {{not exclusively}} on the expected <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq,</b> took place in villages, towns, and cities around the world, including Tokyo, Moscow, Paris, London, Dublin, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Cologne, Bonn, Gothenburg, Florence, Oslo, Rotterdam, Istanbul and Cairo. In New Zealand, thousands rallied in Dunedin and Christchurch, while in Auckland protesters rallied at the Devonport naval base on January 28, opposing the deployment of the frigate HMNZS Te Mana to the Gulf.|$|E
25|$|Although tourism {{declined}} significantly {{during the}} <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq,</b> {{it has been}} subsequently recovered. About 1,659,000 foreign tourists visited Iran in 2004, and 2.3 million in 2009, mostly from Asian countries, including the republics of Central Asia, while about 10% came from the European Union and North America. Since the removal of some sanctions against Iran in 2015, tourism has re-surged in the country. Over five million tourists visited Iran {{in the fiscal year}} of 2014–2015, four percent more than the previous year.|$|E

25|$|The KC-10 plays a {{key role}} in the {{mobilization}} of US military assets, taking part in overseas operations far from home. These aircraft performed airlift and aerial refueling during the 1986 bombing of Libya (Operation Eldorado Canyon), the 1990–91 Gulf <b>War</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm), the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia (Operation Allied Force), War in Afghanistan (Operations Enduring Freedom), and Iraq War (Operations Iraqi Freedom and New Dawn). The KC-10 is expected to serve until 2043.|$|E
25|$|The {{prominence}} of failed prophecy also lends {{support to the}} cult theory. NESARA supporters often tell their readers that the NESARA announcement {{is going to happen}} in a matter of days. These claims have been made too many times to enumerate, without ever coming to fruition. According to the documentary Waiting For NESARA, the claim was also made prior to March 2003 that George Bush was planning the <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> only to further delay the NESARA announcement. It was prophesied that spiritual beings and UFOs would intervene with Bush's plans and prevent the war.|$|E
25|$|Wellstone {{was known}} for his work for peace, the environment, labor, and health care; he also joined his wife Sheila to support the rights of victims of {{domestic}} violence. He made the issue of mental illness a central focus in his career. He was a supporter of immigration to the U.S. He opposed the first Gulf War in 1991 and, in the months before his death, spoke out against the government's threats to go to <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> again. He was strongly supported by groups such as Americans for Democratic Action, the AFL-CIO, the Sierra Club, the American Civil Liberties Union, and People for the American Way.|$|E

50|$|The main {{purchaser}} of Egyptian defense {{products at}} the time was Iraq. In the early 1980s, Iraq was desperate to replace Soviet military equipment lost during {{the early stages of the}} <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Iran. <b>Iraq</b> blunted Iranian attacks with the Saqr 18, the Egyptian-made version of the Soviet BM-21 122mm multiple rocket launcher.|$|R

25|$|As president, Rafsanjani was {{credited}} with spurring Iran's reconstruction following the 1980–88 <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq.</b> Rafsanjani was popular with the upper and middle classes, partially due to his economic reforms during his tenure and his support for human rights (in comparison to the Khomeini years) which have been widely perceived as successful for the most part. However, his reconstruction efforts failed to reach the rural or war zones where they were most needed, leaving him unpopular {{with the majority of}} the rural, veteran, and working class populations. His reforms, despite attempting to curb the powers of the ultra-conservatives, failed to do so, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards received increasing power from Khamenei during his presidency. He was also accused of corruption by both conservatives and reformists, and was known for tough crackdowns on dissent.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, Moran told an anti-war audience in Reston, Virginia, that if [...] "it {{were not for}} the strong support of the Jewish community for this <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq,</b> we would not be doing this. The leaders of the Jewish community are influential enough that they could change the direction of where this is going, and I think they should". This brought criticism from many of his own party, including, among others, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle and Senator Joe Lieberman. Nancy Pelosi, who was House Minority Leader at the time, remarked that [...] "Moran's comments have no place in the Democratic Party." ...|$|E
50|$|The Luna {{was later}} {{extensively}} deployed throughout some Soviet satellite states. The rocket {{has been widely}} exported {{and is now in}} the possession {{of a large number of}} countries. After the <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Iran, <b>Iraq</b> modified its stock of 9M21s with a joint assistance programme with Egypt and Egyptian Army engineers , by extending their range to 90 km and fitting a submunition-carrying warhead. The rocket was renamed Laith-90.|$|R
50|$|Both {{countries}} are major {{oil and gas}} exporters and have clashed over energy policy. Saudi Arabia, with its large oil reserves and smaller population, has a greater interest in taking a long-term view of the global oil market and incentive to moderate prices. In contrast, Iran is compelled to focus on high prices {{in the short term}} due to its low standard of living given recent sanctions after its decade old <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Saddam's <b>Iraq.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{origins of}} the Al-Hussein could {{be traced back to}} the first stages of the <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Iran. <b>Iraq</b> was the first belligerent to use long range {{artillery}} rockets during the Iran–Iraq War, firing limited numbers of FROG-7s at the towns of Dezful and Ahvaz. Iran responded with Scud-Bs obtained from Libya. These missiles can hit a target 185 miles away, therefore key Iraqi cities like Sulaymaniya, Kirkuk, and Baghdad itself came within the range of this weapon.|$|R
500|$|In {{the final}} days of 2002, when an {{invasion}} of Iraq was still a hypothetical question, Daniels told the New York Times that the cost of <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq</b> “could be” in the range of $50 to $60 billion. [...] It was not clear whether Daniels was referring to the cost of a short invasion or a longer war, but he did indicate the administration was budgeting for both. [...] He also described the “back-of-the-envelope” estimate by Bush Economic Advisor Lawrence B. Lindsey that it would cost $100 to $200 billion as much too high. Two days later, after the New Years Holiday, an OMB spokesperson clarified Daniels’ remarks, adding that the $50 to $60 billion figure was not a hard White House estimate and “it is impossible to know what any military campaign would ultimately cost. [...] The only cost estimate we know of in this arena is the Persian Gulf War and that was a $60 billion event".|$|E
500|$|Following Die Another Day, Madonna {{collaborated with}} fashion {{photographer}} Steven Klein in 2003 for an exhibition installation named X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS. It included photography from {{a photo shoot}} in W magazine, and seven video segments. The installation ran from March to May in New York's Deitch Projects gallery. It traveled the world in an edited form. The same year, Madonna released her ninth studio album, American Life, {{which was based on}} her observations of American society; it received mixed reviews. She commented, [...] " [...] was like a trip down memory lane, looking back at everything I've accomplished and all the things I once valued {{and all the things that}} were important to me." [...] Larry Flick from The Advocate felt that [...] "American Life is an album that is among her most adventurous and lyrically intelligent" [...] while condemning it as [...] "a lazy, half-arsed effort to sound and take her seriously." [...] The title song peaked at number 37 on the Hot 100. Its original music video was canceled as Madonna thought that the video, featuring violence and war imagery, would be deemed unpatriotic since America was then at <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iraq.</b> With four million copies sold worldwide, American Life was the lowest-selling album of her career at that point.|$|E
