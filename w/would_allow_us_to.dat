During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke felt {{something}} like a spider's web on his face, and Shine told him she had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E

25|$|In his 2005 book, The Singularity is Near, Kurzweil {{suggests}} that medical advances would {{allow people to}} protect their bodies {{from the effects of}} aging, making the life expectancy limitless. Kurzweil argues that the technological advances in medicine <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> continuously repair and replace defective components in our bodies, prolonging life to an undetermined age. Kurzweil further buttresses his argument by discussing current bio-engineering advances. Kurzweil suggests somatic gene therapy; after synthetic viruses with specific genetic information, the next step would be to apply this technology to gene therapy, replacing human DNA with synthesized genes.|$|E

25|$|Although {{macroscopic}} {{concepts are}} essential for understanding our world, much of fundamental physics {{has been devoted to}} the search for a `theory of everything', a set of equations that perfectly describe the behavior of all fundamental particles. The view that this is the goal of science rests in part on the rationale that such a theory <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> derive the behavior of all macroscopic concepts, at least in principle. The evidence we have presented suggests that this view may be overly optimistic. A `theory of everything' is one of many components necessary for complete understanding of the universe, but is not necessarily the only one. The development of macroscopic laws from first principles may involve more than just systematic logic, and could require conjectures suggested by experiments, simulations or insight.|$|E

Lt. General Shaul Mofaz, the IDF's Chief of the General Staff, regarded the camps as [...] "evidence of the risks of a new Palestinian upheaval". The Arafat aide who oversees the camps compared the camps to the Israeli Gadna corps for teenagers and said [...] "We hope that we will achieve our rights through negotiations, so that summer camps like these will cease to exist. ...

As we pushed the Japanese back, P-40 pilots were slowly {{left out of the}} war. So when I moved to P-38s, an excellent aircraft, I did not [...] that the P-40 was an inferior fighter, but because I knew the P-38 <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> reach the enemy.

In 1945, the 71st Reconnaissance Group employed them as armed forward air controllers during ground operations in the Philippines, until it received delivery of P-51s. They claimed 655 aerial victories.|$|E

2500|$|Originally, the {{developers}} {{had intended to}} do a straight adaptation of the film. However, they quickly concluded that doing so presented two inherent problems; the original screenplay was so good, they felt it couldn't be replicated in a gaming environment, and because Montana dies at the end, they felt players {{would not want to}} invest in developing a character that they knew was doomed from the beginning. As such, they decided the game would tell an original story, set after the film. Jason Bone, combat designer on the game, explained [...] "We didn't want to rehash the movie because we feel that to make a good game, {{there needs to be a}} compelling storyline with good characters that drive you through it. There have been a lot of games that have been made based on movies, and when they follow the exact storyline of the movie, you lose a little bit of interest if you know where things are going.

2500|$|The [...] "Triumph of Bohr" [...] {{consisted}} in his demonstrating, once again, that Einstein's subtle {{argument was}} not conclusive, {{but even more}} so {{in the way that}} he arrived at this conclusion by appealing precisely to one of the great ideas of Einstein: the principle of equivalence between gravitational mass and inertial mass, together with the time dilation of special relativity, and a consequence of these--the Gravitational redshift. Bohr showed that, in order for Einstein's experiment to function, the box would have to be suspended on a spring {{in the middle of a}} gravitational field. In order to obtain a measurement of the weight of the box, a pointer would have to be attached to the box which corresponded with the index on a scale. After the release of a photon, a mass [...] could be added to the box to restore it to its original position and this <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> determine the energy [...] that was lost when the photon left. The box is immersed in a gravitational field of strength , and the gravitational redshift affects the speed of the clock, yielding uncertainty [...] in the time [...] required for the pointer to return to its original position.

30|$|An {{extension}} to the graph theoretical approach {{for the analysis}} of associative memory introduced by Palm is presented along with details on the derivation of the k-assembly from the cell assembly model. Although Algorithm 4 is not fast enough to solve the problem in a brain-sized neuronal network, it does offer a solution to the problem, permits <b>us</b> <b>to</b> analyze the structure of a given random graph and gain insight on understanding k-assemblies and cell assemblies. For instance, the fact that for some graphs there may be a larger number of minimal 5 -cores than 3 -cores <b>allowed</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> observe how the structures overlap. If we look at it in terms of memory, we can tell that certain nodes are members of several k-assemblies, and the absence of one of them may change the structure of the network completely. If larger data sets become available we could use standard techniques for network clustering or k-core decomposition that <b>would</b> <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> partition the graph and find minimal k-cores within the partitions.|$|R

60|$|The English are patriotic; but patriotism is the {{unconscious}} form of nationalism. It is being national without understanding {{the meaning of}} a nation. The Americans are on the whole too self-conscious, kept moving too much in the pace of public life, with all its temptations to superficiality and fashion; too much aware of outside opinion and with too much appetite for outside criticism. But the English are much too unconscious; and would be the better for an increase in many forms of consciousness, including consciousness of sin. But even their sin is ignorance of their real virtue. The most admirable English things are not the things that are most admired by the English, or for which the English admire themselves. They are things now blindly neglected and in daily danger of being destroyed. It is all the worse that they should be destroyed, because there is really nothing like them in the world. That is why I have suggested a note of nationalism rather than patriotism for the English; the power of seeing their nation as a nation and not as the nature of things. We say of some ballad from the Balkans or some peasant costume in the Netherlands that it is unique; but the good things of England really are unique. Our very isolation from continental wars and revolutionary reconstructions have kept them unique. The particular kind of beauty there is in an English village, the particular kind of humour there is in an English public-house, are things that cannot be found in lands where the village is far more simply and equally governed, or where the vine is far more honourably served and praised. Yet we shall not save them by merely sinking into them with the conservative sort of contentment, even if the commercial rapacity of our plutocratic reforms <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do so. We must in a sense get far away from England in order to behold her; we must rise above patriotism in order to be practically patriotic; we must have some sense of more varied and remote things before these vanishing virtues can be seen suddenly for what they are; almost as one might fancy that a man would have to rise to the dizziest heights of the divine understanding before he saw, as from a peak far above a whirlpool, how precious is his perishing soul.|$|E
