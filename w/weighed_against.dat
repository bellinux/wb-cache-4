5|$|Liver {{and kidney}} disease {{can affect the}} {{biological}} activity of analgesics. When people with diminishing liver or kidney function are treated with oral opioids they must be monitored for the possible need to reduce dose, extend dosing intervals, or switch to other opioids or other modes of delivery. The benefit of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be <b>weighed</b> <b>against</b> their gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks.|$|E
5|$|The British {{government}} has {{required that the}} cost to animals in an experiment be <b>weighed</b> <b>against</b> the gain in knowledge. Some medical schools and agencies in China, Japan, and South Korea have built cenotaphs for killed animals. In Japan there are also annual memorial services (Ireisai 慰霊祭) for animals sacrificed at medical school.|$|E
5|$|Ability {{of judges}} to balance {{competing}} policy considerations. Where the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, judges may be ill-equipped to decide {{because of their}} limited training, experience and access to materials. Thus, the courts should avoid reviewing the merits of such executive decisions. This was mentioned in GCHQ where Lord Diplock held {{that the type of}} evidence admissible in the judicial process {{and the way in which}} it is adduced tends to exclude from the attention of the court competing policy considerations which need to be <b>weighed</b> <b>against</b> one another.|$|E

5|$|Many {{wind power}} {{companies}} work with local communities to reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms. In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects. Appropriate government consultation, planning and approval procedures {{also help to}} minimize environmental risks. Some may still object to wind farms but, according to The Australia Institute, their concerns should be <b>weighed</b> <b>against</b> the {{need to address the}} threats posed by climate change and the opinions of the broader community.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 60% of late-Cretaceous Scleractinia coral genera {{failed to}} cross the K–Pg {{boundary}} into the Paleocene. Further analysis of the coral extinctions shows that approximately 98% of colonial species, ones that inhabit warm, shallow tropical waters, became extinct. The solitary corals, which generally do not form reefs and inhabit colder and deeper (below the photic zone) areas of the ocean were less impacted by the K–Pg boundary. Colonial coral species rely upon symbiosis with photosynthetic algae, which collapsed due to the events surrounding the K–Pg boundary, however, the use of data from coral fossils to support K–Pg extinction and subsequent Paleocene recovery, must be <b>weighed</b> <b>against</b> the changes that occurred in coral ecosystems through the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that the native blue crab in eastern North America, Callinectes sapidus, is able to control populations of C.maenas; numbers of the two species are negatively correlated, and C.maenas is not found in the Chesapeake Bay, where Callinectes sapidus is most frequent. On the west coast of North America, C.maenas appears to be limited to upper estuarine habitats, in part because of predation by native rock crabs (Romaleon antennarium and Cancer productus) and competition for shelter with a native shore crab, Hemigrapsus oregonensis. Host specificity testing has recently been conducted on Sacculina carcini, a parasitic barnacle, as a potential biological control agent of C.maenas. In the laboratory, Sacculina settled on, infected, and killed native California crabs, including the Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus magister (formerly Cancer magister), and the shore crabs Hemigrapsus nudus, Hemigrapsus oregonensis and Pachygrapsus crassipes. Dungeness crabs were the most vulnerable of the tested native species to settlement and infection by the parasite. Although Sacculina did not mature in any of the native crabs, developing reproductive sacs were observed inside a few Metacarcinus magister and Hemigrapsus oregonensis. Any potential benefits of using Sacculina to control C.maenas on the west coast of North America would need to be <b>weighed</b> <b>against</b> these potential non-target impacts.|$|E

5|$|The Vijayanagar Empire ruled Kanchipuram from 1361 to 1645. The {{earliest}} inscriptions attesting to Vijayanagar rule {{are those}} of Kumara Kampanna from 1364 and 1367, which {{were found in the}} precincts of the Kailasanathar Temple and Varadaraja Perumal Temple respectively. His inscriptions record the re-institution of Hindu rituals in the Kailasanathar Temple that had been abandoned during the Muslim invasions. Inscriptions of the Vijayanagar kings Harihara II, Deva Raya II, Krishna Deva Raya, Achyuta Deva Raya, Sriranga I, and Venkata II are found within the city. Harihara II endowed grants in favour of the Varadaraja Perumal Temple.In the 15th century, Kanchipuram was invaded by the Velama Nayaks in 1437, the Gajapati kingdom in 14631465 and 147475 and the Bahmani Sultanate in about 1480. A 1467 inscription of Virupaksha Raya II mentions a cantonment in the vicinity of Kanchipuram. In 1486, Saluva Narasimha Deva Raya, the governor of the Kanchipuram region, overthrew the Sangama Dynasty of Vijayanagar and founded the Saluva Dynasty. Like most of his predecessors, Narasimha donated generously to the Varadaraja Perumal Temple. Kanchipuram was visited twice by the Vijayanagar king Krishna Deva Raya, considered to be the greatest of the Vijayanagar rulers, and 16 inscriptions of his time are found in the Varadaraja Perumal Temple. The inscriptions in four languagesTamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Sanskritrecord the genealogy of the Tuluva kings and their contributions, along with those of their nobles, towards the upkeep of the shrine. His successor, Achyuta Deva Raya, reportedly had himself <b>weighed</b> <b>against</b> pearls in Kanchipuram and distributed the pearls amongst the poor. Throughout {{the second half of the}} 16th and first half of the 17th centuries, the Aravidu Dynasty tried to maintain a semblance of authority in the southern parts after losing their northern territories in the Battle of Talikota. Venkata II (15861614) tried to revive the Vijayanagar Empire, but the kingdom relapsed into confusion after his death and rapidly fell apart after the Vijayanagar king Sriranga III's defeat by the Golconda and Bijapur sultanates in 1646.|$|E

25|$|The {{distributed}} {{production of}} hydrogen {{in this fashion}} {{would be expected to}} generate air emissions of pollutants and carbon dioxide at various points in the supply chain, e.g., electrolysis, transportation and storage.

25|$|Customers {{under such}} tariffs could see {{significant}} savings by being careful {{about when the}} vehicle was charged, for example, by using a timer to restrict charging to off-peak hours.

5000|$|Is {{the claim}} or defense {{for which the}} {{information}} is sought deemed core to the case? No. The information sought by TMRT is associated with only one of 27 defenses.

25|$|Landscape and {{heritage}} issues {{may be a}} significant issue for certain wind farms. However, these are minimal {{when compared with the}} Environmental effects of coal.

25|$|Because of the Canadian lawyers' {{success in}} {{narrowing}} the definition to the actual, observable, economic damage, the arbitrators awarded $78,000 in damages for 2 burns causing visible damage in 1934 and 1936.

When <b>weighed</b> <b>against</b> {{the backbone of the}} Trail economy, as well as the smelter's contributions to the war effort, the economic contributions of small-scale famers in a less fertile agricultural area were minimal.|$|E
25|$|SAD {{paramilitary}} {{teams were}} active in Afghanistan in the 1990s in clandestine operations to locate and kill or capture Osama Bin Laden.
