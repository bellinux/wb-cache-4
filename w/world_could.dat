5|$|William Beebe died of {{pneumonia}} at Simla on June 4, 1962. According to his wishes, {{he was buried}} in Mucurapo cemetery in Port of Spain. Memorial services were held in both Trinidad and New York City, so that Beebe's friends in both parts of the <b>world</b> <b>could</b> attend. Following Beebe's death, Jocelyn succeeded him {{as the director of}} the Department of Tropical Research, and continued to run the Simla station along with the rest of Beebe's former staff.|$|E
5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali with her left foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. The pose shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali would not stop until she destroyed the <b>world,</b> <b>could</b> only think of one way to pacify her. He {{lay down on the}} battlefield so {{that she would have to}} step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali realized that she had gone too far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot on his chest.|$|E
5|$|In chemistry, {{one central}} issue was the {{distinction}} between organic and inorganic substances, especially {{in the context of}} organic transformations such as fermentation and putrefaction. Since Aristotle these had been considered essentially biological (vital) processes. However, Friedrich Wöhler, Justus Liebig and other pioneers of the rising field of organic chemistry—building on the work of Lavoisier—showed that the organic <b>world</b> <b>could</b> often be analyzed by physical and chemical methods. In 1828 Wöhler showed that the organic substance urea could be created by chemical means that do not involve life, providing a powerful challenge to vitalism. Cell extracts ("ferments") that could effect chemical transformations were discovered, beginning with diastase in 1833. By the end of the 19th century the concept of enzymes was well established, though equations of chemical kinetics would not be applied to enzymatic reactions until the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, {{going back to}} director Andrew Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992, shortly after his son was born, {{he and his family}} took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater <b>world</b> <b>could</b> be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.|$|E
5|$|Theistic {{evolution}} was {{the idea}} that God intervened in the process of evolution, to guide {{it in such a way}} that the living <b>world</b> <b>could</b> still be considered to be designed. The term was promoted by Charles Darwin's greatest American advocate Asa Gray. However, this idea gradually fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and more committed to the idea of methodological naturalism and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive. By 1900, theistic evolution had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions, although it retained a strong popular following.|$|E
5|$|The Watcher and {{his companions}} pursue Thaos {{to the city of}} Twin Elms, where they finally learn the truth behind Thaos' actions. The gods are {{synthetic}} beings created by ancient animancers to serve as a civilizing force for the world, which doesn't have any real gods. Thaos is the last survivor of their order, and has survived the centuries by transferring his soul from one body to the next. His eternal mission is to ensure that no one discovers the gods' secret, because then mortals would question their divine authority, and the <b>world</b> <b>could</b> then regress into sectarianism and barbarism. To this end, he works to discredit and suppress animancy wherever it flourishes, because modern animancers may eventually discover the truth through their science. He stole the souls of the Hollowborn to empower the goddess Woedica, who hates animancy and would see it destroyed. Though the other gods have an interest in protecting their secret, they do not want Woedica to dominate them, and so they help the Watcher reach Thaos.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional academies established by the Order, the Exploration Corps maintained several spacefaring mobile academies such as the Chu'unthor so that roaming the galaxy and exploring new <b>worlds</b> <b>could</b> be achieved while still teaching traditional doctrine.|$|R
60|$|Mildred drew back, for <b>worlds</b> <b>could</b> {{not have}} tempted her {{to witness the}} desperate effort that she knew must follow. By this time, Sir Wycherly, who had been an {{interested}} witness of all that passed, found his voice, and assumed the office of director.|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need to find innovative activities to help the older population maintain a healthy life. Virtual worlds, which can provide social engagement, entertainment and creativity as well as useful information and services for older people might offer {{a solution to this}} issue. Although emerging studies have begun to look into the benefits of virtual worlds in healthcare, little has been done in the context of older people. Based on semi-structured interviews and previous research on healthy aging, we identified and described in depth four areas in which virtual <b>worlds</b> <b>could</b> be useful to support older people. In general, it was found that virtual <b>worlds</b> <b>could</b> help empower older people to manage their disabilities, facilitate social engagement, provide mental stimulation and productive activities...|$|R

25|$|If the Islamic {{calendar}} {{were prepared}} using astronomical calculations, Muslims throughout the Muslim <b>world</b> <b>could</b> {{use it to}} meet all their needs, the way they use the Gregorian calendar today. But, there are divergent views on whether it is licit to do so.|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of a topological model to the matter content of a conventional closed-string theory leads to the appearance of many perturbatively-decoupled space-time worlds.

25|$|Men may congratulate {{themselves}} for writing truly and passionately about {{the movements of}} nations; they may consider war {{and the search for}} God to be great literature's only subjects; but if men's standing in the <b>world</b> <b>could</b> be toppled by an ill-advised choice of hat, English literature would be dramatically changed.|$|E
25|$|The great {{influence}} of the 17th century was the French philosopher, René Descartes (1596–1650), whose Meditations (1641) informed attitudes about animals well into the 20th century. Writing during the scientific revolution, Descartes proposed a mechanistic theory of the universe, the aim of which was {{to show that the}} <b>world</b> <b>could</b> be mapped out without allusion to subjective experience.|$|E
25|$|The broad {{availability}} of low-cost Internet connections {{starting in the}} mid-1990s lessened the need for FidoNet's store-and-forward system, as any system in the <b>world</b> <b>could</b> be reached for equal cost. Direct dialing into local BBS systems rapidly declined. The {{availability of}} internet connectivity {{is by no means}} universal, and although FidoNet has shrunk considerably since the early 1990s, it remains in use around the world.|$|E
50|$|Like most 4X games, Pax Imperias basic {{gameplay}} involved building spaceships {{and flying}} to other worlds {{in order to}} take them over. Once captured, the <b>worlds</b> <b>could</b> be upgraded to provide materials, ships, and improve their defensive capabilities. Unlike most other 4X games, Pax had much more complex solar systems, including moving planets, their moons, and a habitable temperature zone that varied depending on the star and the races preferences.|$|R

25|$|After having {{for a time}} {{endorsed}} Theodor Herzl, including {{presiding over}} {{a meeting at the}} Maccabean Club, London, addressed by Herzl on 24 November 1895, and endorsing the main Palestine-oriented Zionist movement, Zangwill quit the established philosophy and founded his own organisation, named the Jewish Territorialist Organization in 1905. Its goal was to create a Jewish homeland in whatever possible territory in the <b>world</b> <b>could</b> be found for them, with speculations including Canada, Australia, Mesopotamia, Uganda and Cyrenaica.|$|E
25|$|In 1881, {{he took a}} job as {{a teacher}} in Oconto, Wisconsin. There, he {{continued}} to read voraciously, and had a particular attraction for science. It was here that he started to develop a passion for helping people understand science. He believed that science was the key to the future of society, and that if people could be taught to think with the reasoned, thoughtful, unbiased critical perspective of science, that much suffering in the <b>world</b> <b>could</b> be alleviated.|$|E

25|$|If global price {{movements}} are transmitted to local markets, {{farmers in the}} developing <b>world</b> <b>could</b> benefit from the rising price of food. According to researchers from the Overseas Development Institute, this may depend on farmers' capacity to respond to changing market conditions. Experience suggests that farmers lack the credit and inputs needed to respond in the short term. In the medium or long term, however, they could benefit, {{as seen in the}} Asian Green Revolution or in many African countries in the recent past.|$|E
25|$|By {{reason of}} the very purity of His being, God is {{distinguished}} from all finite beings. Hence it follows, in the first place, that the <b>world</b> <b>could</b> only have come from God by creation; secondly, that not even {{by way of a}} miracle can any finite nature be given creative power, which of itself directly attains the very being of any being; and finally, that no created agent can in any way influence the being of any effect unless it has itself been moved by the first Cause.|$|E
25|$|Self-sufficiency had {{traditionally}} been a powerful stimulus for exploring and developing the country's huge, yet widely dispersed, resource base. It remained {{a source of}} national pride that the Soviet Union, alone among the industrialized countries of the <b>world,</b> <b>could</b> claim the ability to satisfy almost all the requirements of its economy using its own natural resources. The abundance of fossil fuels supplied not just the Soviet Union's domestic needs. For many years, an ample surplus was exported to consumers in Eastern Europe and Western Europe, where it earned most of the Soviet Union's convertible currency.|$|E
