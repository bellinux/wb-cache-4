5|$|Three-year-old {{polar bear}} Mercedes {{was given to}} the zoo in 1984, after she was rescued in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. She had begun {{wandering}} into the town in search of food. Because of the danger she posed to residents, Mercedes was tagged with a number so she could be tracked. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not be persuaded to return to the wild, a decision was taken to shoot her. A member of the Edinburgh Zoological Society collaborated with a cousin in Canada {{and they were able to}} rescue Mercedes, finding her a new home at Edinburgh zoo.

5|$|About January 1944, Moyzisch hired a new {{secretary}} named Cornelia Kapp, {{also known}} as Nele Kapp, who had spied for the British and Americans in exchange for permission to immigrate to the United States. She had worked at the Germany embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria beginning in July 1943 and within a month had become a spy. In January 1944, she moved to Ankara {{to work at the}} German embassy under Moyzisch. Kapp was asked by the OSS to learn about the spy that Moyzisch met with. Kapp was adept at gathering intelligence within the office. She flirted with Cicero when he called the office to schedule a meeting with Moyzisch. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> Kapp also followed the two men to try to see what the spy looked like, but was unsuccessful at getting a good view of him. Kapp had gathered and shared a lot of information with the OSS over the months that she worked at the embassy, including all that she felt that she could learn about Cicero.|$|E

5|$|The ballad, The Mermaid of Padstow, tells {{a similar}} story of a local named Tom Yeo, who shot the mermaid mistaking her for a seal. John Betjeman, who was well-acquainted with the area, wrote in 1969 that the mermaid met a local man {{and fell in love}} with him. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> no longer bear living without him, she tried to lure him beneath the waves but he escaped by {{shooting}} her. In her rage she threw a handful of sand towards Padstow, around which the sandbank grew. In other versions of the tale, the mermaid sings from the rocks and a youth shoots at her with a crossbow, or a greedy man shoots her with a longbow. Mermaids were believed to sing to their victims so that they can lure adulterers to their death.|$|E

25|$|Catherine {{believed}} in the humanist ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose power depended on letters as well as arms, and she {{was familiar with the}} writing of Erasmus, among others, on the subject. She enjoyed and collected books, and moved the royal collection to the Louvre, her principal residence. She delighted in the company of learned men and women, and her court was highly literary. Her government officials, such as secretary-of-state Nicolas de Neufville, seigneur de Villeroy, whose wife translated the epistles of Ovid, were perfectly at home in literary circles. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> find the time, Catherine occasionally wrote verses herself, which she would show to the court poets. Her reading was not entirely highbrow, however. A superstitious woman, she believed implicitly in astrology and soothsaying, and her reading matter included The Book of Sibyls and the almanacs of Nostradamus.|$|E
25|$|After a brief 1957 {{engagement}} to GMO vocalist Lorry Peters, Hambro met vocalist and beauty queen Lynn Michels in 1958, {{when he was}} 34 and she was 18. Michels, born Charlotte Joyce Wexler, was from Chester, Pennsylvania. She was on stage from an early age, working alongside a number of Pennsylvania-based acts, including The Four Aces and Bill Haley and the Comets. At age 10, she took first place during an appearance on Paul Whiteman's Philadelphia-based Saturday morning talent show, TV Teen Club (an indirect predecessor to American Bandstand). Later, she was a regular on the Sunday morning children's talent show, The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour, hosted by Stan Lee Broza on WCAU TV in Philadelphia and broadcast on WNBT TV in New York. While still in High School, Michels sang with the Al Raymond big band, playing the many ballrooms and lounges in the Tri-State area, as well as performing for weddings, ballroom dances, and senior proms at many Tri-State area high schools and colleges. However, the band's steady gig was Sunday nights at Upper Darby's St. Alice's Social Center. When she met Hambro in 1958, Michels was in her {{senior year of high}} school and singing with Al Raymond. She was introduced to Hambro by the manager of the El Rancho Club in Woodlyn, Pennsylvania, where she had gone to see Ray McKinley's Glenn Miller Orchestra. Hambro called her later that year to invite her to a GMO performance at a ballroom in Philadelphia. That evening, Hambro told her that he would pursue and marry her, but it was an extended and often long-distance courtship. When Michels graduated from high school, she went to work for the Matys Brothers, a rockabilly and later polka band from the Philadelphia area that was part of Bill Haley's stable. She would be with them until June 1960, touring the U.S. and Canada, while continuing to see Hambro <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> Hambro and Michels were engaged July 23, 1960, after a GMO gig at the Brandywine Music Box and married on November5,1960, at The Wynne catering hall on North 54th Street in Philadelphia (Wynnefield), with Ray McKinley as their best man, and Ray's wife, Gretchen, looking on. They moved into an apartment at 159-15 83rd Avenue in Kew Gardens, Queens, New York. Son, Larry was born in the late summer of 1961, followed by brother Lee, in the winter of 1963.|$|E
500|$|Kasuga {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of Destroyer Squadron (Suiraisentai) 3 from 13 December 1915 to 13 May 1916 and 12 September 1916 to 13 April 1917. After the incursion of the German commerce raider [...] into the Indian Ocean in March 1917, the British Admiralty requested that the Japanese government reinforce its ships already present, there and in Australian waters. The ship was sent south and escorted Allied shipping between Colombo, Ceylon and Freemantle, Australia in April–May. She was based at Singapore through November. On 11 January 1918, Kasuga ran aground on a sandbank in the Bangka Strait, in the Dutch East Indies, where she was stuck until June, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> finally be refloated for repairs.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{completion}} of repairs, Scharnhorst went into the Baltic Sea for gunnery training. Heavy ice in the Baltic kept the ship there until February 1940 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> return to Wilhelmshaven, arriving on 5 February. She was then assigned to the forces participating in Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Denmark and Norway. Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were the covering force for the assaults on Narvik and Trondheim; the two ships left Wilhelmshaven {{on the morning of}} 7 April. They were joined by the heavy cruiser [...] Later that day, at around 14:30, the three ships came under attack by a force of British bombers, which failed to make any hits. Heavy winds caused significant structural damage that evening, and flooding contaminated a portion of Scharnhorsts fuel stores.|$|E
500|$|Alexandra's first child, Albert Victor, {{was born}} two months {{premature}} in early 1864. Alexandra showed devotion to her children: [...] "She {{was in her}} glory <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> run up to the nursery, put on a flannel apron, wash the children herself and see them asleep in their little beds." [...] Albert Edward and Alexandra had six children in total: Albert Victor, George, Louise, Victoria, Maud, and John. All of Alexandra's children were apparently born prematurely; biographer Richard Hough thought Alexandra deliberately misled Queen Victoria as to her probable delivery dates, as {{she did not want}} the queen to be present at their births. During the birth of her third child in 1867, the added complication of a bout of rheumatic fever threatened Alexandra's life, and left her with a permanent limp.|$|E
500|$|On July 27, 2010, the {{conviction}} of Warren Jeffs as an accomplice to Elissa Wall's rape was overturned because [...] "instructions given to jurors were erroneous." [...] State authorities considered retrying Jeffs in Utah, though the matter was complicated when Wall was accused of fabricating a key piece of evidence during the first trial; Wall's attorneys had used medical records for proof of a 2002 miscarriage, and thus proof of intimacy in the marriage. Michael Piccarreta, Jeffs' defense attorney, interviewed Jane Blackmore, Wall's midwife {{at the time of}} the miscarriage, in November 2010 and alleged that Wall had requested that she recreate the detailed records <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not find them.

500|$|Pauline was grief-stricken {{and later}} said [...] "My poor little boy. If only I {{had been with}} him...I would have nursed him as I nursed his father". She came to blame Borghese for his {{decision}} to send Dermide to Frascati and called him [...] "the butcher of my son", believing that, {{had it not been}} for her husband, her son [...] "would still be alive". Leclerc's parents accused Pauline of having neglected Dermide, leaving him to die under the care of servants, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have left him in France, to live with them. Nonetheless, Pauline had her son buried at the Château de Montgobert, next to General Leclerc. Dermide's inheritance reverted to his father's family and, in spite of her wishes to be buried beside her son and first husband at Montgobert, Pauline was buried at the Saint Mary Major Basilica in Rome upon her death in 1825.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, she {{appeared}} in an episode of Channel 4's Alan Davies vehicle One for the Road and made her last theatre appearance as a cast member in the Bush Theatre's Two Lips, Indifferent Red. In 1996, she {{had a role in}} Stephen Poliakoff's Frontiers, and played a club barmaid in Dennis Potter's penultimate television series Karaoke. The following year she had roles in the comedy film Roseanna's Grave (Paul Weiland, 1997), an episode of The Bill—as a woman whose nanny is accused of stealing from her—and a two-part episode of the Kevin Whately series The Broker's Man as a police officer. Her role in The Broker's Man {{was one of the few}} occasions on which Ripley played a police officer; she has frequently declined offers of similar roles because she does not want to [...] "summon up the misery" [...] to play a character that performs post-mortem examinations or investigates murders <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be starring in more true to life and funny programmes.|$|E
500|$|Bessie's {{aggressive}} anti-Toryism {{was frequently}} in evidence {{during her first}} years in parliament, especially <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> attribute to them the economic miseries of her Liverpool constituents. In a Commons debate on 28March 1946 she welcomed the government's decision to close the Liverpool Cotton Association, which she denounced as [...] "the bulwark of the Tory administration in Liverpool", {{nothing more than a}} group of financiers who gambled with the industry in order to make profits for themselves. On 1May 1947 The Manchester Guardian, reporting the chaotic Commons scenes during the divisions following a debate on the nationalisation of the railways, recorded that [...] "Mrs E.M. Braddock... danced a jig as she moved over to the Opposition benches where she occupied the seat usually used by Mr Churchill." [...] When the Bolton Evening News called her performance [...] "nauseating, a sorry degradation of democratic discussion" [...] she sued the newspaper for defamation. She lost the case, and a subsequent appeal was unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1936, {{the crew of the}} Insect class gunboat HMS Gnat voted to get a ship's mascot. This was {{due in part to the}} {{competitive}} nature of the gunboats, with HMS Bee, Cicada, and Cricket already having mascots of their own. The Captain and the Chief Bosun's mate, Lt. Cmdr. J. Waldergrave and Chief Petty Officer Charles Jefferey, purchased Judy from the kennel and presented her to the crew. As her mother was known as Kelly of Sussex, Judy was listed as Judy of Sussex in her Royal Navy paperwork. It was hoped to train her as a gundog, but the men began to treat her like a pet instead, and several days after her arrival, Jefferey's log stated that [...] "our chances of making her a trained gundog are very small." [...] Her time spent on the streets of Shanghai was blamed for her lack of hunting instinct, the only time that she would point in the traditional manner was <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> smell food.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Clarence Waldron from Jet, Cole said the idea of recording a Christmas album started after {{a telephone call from}} producer and longtime friend Michael Masser, with whom Cole had worked on the song [...] "Someone That I Used to Love" [...] from her 1980 album Don't Look Back and her 1989 single [...] "Miss You Like Crazy". Cole described the telephone call from Masser as unexpected; Masser told her, [...] "I've got this beautiful Christmas song I wrote just for you". When they met, Messer played [...] "No More Blue Christmas"; after the session they both agreed to record a Christmas album. Cole described the decision to form a Christmas album as leaving her [...] "running around in April, looking for Christmas songs". Cole expressed hope that the album would remind her fans about [...] "the true spirit of the holiday season". She wanted it to communicate that Christmas is [...] "a time for families to reflect and not just wait until the holidays to be a family". Cole's twin sister Timolin Cole said, [...] "Christmas Eve has always been a magical time with Natalie" [...] <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> connect with family over holiday traditions.|$|E
500|$|In 1898 Bondfield {{accepted}} {{the job of}} assistant secretary of NUSAWC, which that year became [...] "NAUSAWC" [...] after amalgamating with the United Shop Assistants' Union. From this time onward she subordinated her life to her union work and to the wider cause of socialism. She [...] "had no vocation for wifehood or motherhood, but an urge to serve the Union... I had 'the dear love of comrades' [...] ". At the time the union's membership, at under 3,000, represented {{only a small fraction}} of shopworkers, and Bondfield gave priority to increasing this proportion. For months she travelled the country, distributing literature and arranging meetings <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> with mixed outcomes in the face of apathy from shop staff, and outright opposition from shopowners. In Reading and Bristol she reported no success, although in Gloucester, she thought, [...] "it should not be difficult to organise every shop worker". In 1899 Bondfield was the first woman delegate to the Trades Union Annual Congress, that year held in Plymouth, where she participated in the vote that led to the formation in 1900 of the Labour Representation Committee (LRC), forerunner of the Labour Party. NAUSAWC, its membership by then around 7,000, was one of the first unions to affiliate to the committee.|$|E
500|$|Although Brooks [...] "never meant" [...] {{to return}} to television, he was helping Tracey Ullman start The Tracey Ullman Show and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not find another producer, he stepped in. On the {{suggestion}} of friend and colleague Polly Platt, who gave Brooks the nine panel Life in Hell cartoon entitled [...] "The Los Angeles Way of Death" [...] which hangs outside Brooks' Gracie Films office, Brooks asked Life in Hell cartoonist Matt Groening to pitch {{an idea for a}} series of animated shorts to appear on The Tracey Ullman Show. Groening initially intended to present an animated version of his Life in Hell series. However, when Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life's work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family in the lobby of Brooks' office. After the success of the shorts, the Fox Broadcasting Company in 1989 commissioned a series of half-hour episodes of the show, now called The Simpsons, which Brooks produced alongside Groening and Sam Simon. Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content. According to writer Jon Vitti, Brooks contributed more to the episode [...] "Lisa's Substitute" [...] than to any other in the show's history. The Simpsons garnered critical and commercial acclaim, winning numerous awards and is still producing original content after 20 years. In a 1998 issue celebrating the 20th century's greatest achievements in arts and entertainment, Time magazine named The Simpsons the century's best television series. In 1997, Brooks was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.|$|E
500|$|Kirkwood branded Mercedes [...] "a savvy, ballsy {{girl that}} can't say no and is unapologetic about it". Metcalfe has {{described}} Mercedes {{as someone who}} [...] "hates every woman in Hollyoaks" [...] except her own sisters, and as someone who talks too much and has a [...] "mouth like a foghorn". She {{went on to say}} that Mercedes [...] "always looks after her family and would never do anything to deliberately hurt them. Mercedes' heart is definitely in the right place". Metcalfe observed that Mercedes is [...] "completely mad" [...] and she [...] "just does whatever she feels like doing at the time. She doesn't exactly think things through". Metcalfe further explained that Mercedes did not [...] "consider consequences", which led her to unintentionally [...] "destroy everything". She elaborated on this, saying that Mercedes never has a happy ending [...] "because she can't. I don't think with Mercedes there is ever a happy ending. Just when something might go her way or something's going to go right for her, she destroys it". She said that her character is [...] "used to getting her own way" [...] so she thought that despite her actions, [...] "everything will turn out right in the end". She opined that Mercedes was at her best in this state, being [...] "minxy and destructive". Metcalfe described Mercedes in this way: [...] "Whatever she does that's bad, she manages to justify in her head. She doesn't have much self-worth and she knows what she's like". Metcalfe also expressed the hope that Mercedes could be happy [...] "free and single". She explained that Mercedes was unable to remain happy, saying: [...] "she has moments of happiness but ruins them herself". She went on to explain that due to Mercedes' first love having [...] "messed her up", Mercedes behaved [...] "the way she is where men are concerned". She further explained that Mercedes believed she could change but was disappointed <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not.
