5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov became {{especially}} appreciated within The Five, {{and among}} those <b>who</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> circle, for his talents as an orchestrator. He {{was asked by}} Balakirev to orchestrate a Schubert march for a concert in May 1868, by Cui to orchestrate the opening chorus of his opera William Ratcliff and by Alexander Dargomyzhsky, whose works were greatly appreciated by The Five and who was close to death, to orchestrate his opera The Stone Guest.|$|E

5|$|Although the Inaccessible Island rail {{may have}} been known to the Tristan Islanders <b>who</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> island {{annually}} to hunt seals, the species first {{came to the attention of}} scientists during the Challenger expedition of 1872–1876. When the expedition visited the island in October 1873, Sir Charles Wyville Thomson learned of the species and recorded observations made by two German brothers, the Stoltenhoffs, who had been living on the island for the last two years. Thomson was unable to collect a specimen, much to his regret.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, WPD {{applied to}} the Environment Agency for a {{discharge}} licence in order to completely drain the reservoir, which was granted in July 2010. The issue was taken to UK Parliament by Jonathan Evans where he stated that an independent report by the Halcrow Group (advising for the Environment Agency) explained that draining the reservoir could create 'new risks to reservoir safety'. Evans' predecessor, Julie Morgan, had previously taken the issue of saving the reservoir site to parliament, and had garnered support from politicians such as Peter Hain (the Welsh Secretary) and Ed Miliband (later leader of the Labour Party), <b>who</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> site during the May 2010 general election campaign, commenting on the site's tranquillity.|$|E

5|$|No {{information}} on the bridge survives from ancient sources. The first descriptions appear in European travellers' accounts from the 19thcentury. The British archaeologist Charles Fellows {{was the first to}} explore the region of Lycia, and visited the bridge in May1840. Fellows, as well as T.A.B. Spratt and Edward Forbes, <b>who</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> site two years later, describe it as having 25 arches. In 1882, an Austrian expedition, including Otto Benndorf, interpreted the structure as part of an ancient road that connected Limyra with the city of Attaleia (modern Antalya) to the east. However, this mission failed to produce any plans or sketches of the site.|$|E
5|$|Pietrangeli, in his {{foreword}} to The Sistine Chapel, written {{after the}} restoration of the lunettes, but prior to {{the restoration of}} the ceiling, commends those who had the courage to commence the restoration process, and thanks not only those <b>who</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> restoration while it was in progress and gave the benefit of their knowledge and experience, but also those who were critical of the enterprise. Pietrangeli made acknowledgement that these people spurred the team on to punctilious documentation so that a full report of criteria and methods should be available to those who are interested, both in the present and the future.|$|E

5|$|The Courtyard Cafe and The Fountain {{located within}} the Library also became an institution, well-patronised by library users, office workers and the local arts {{community}} from The Substation. As such, many fond memories were created for those <b>who</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> compounds of the Library. At the same time, the pressure of urban redevelopment in the city was building up, resulting in demolishing of old city fabric that would threaten the Library building's fate and its sentimental memories in the ensuing years.|$|E
5|$|The Skagen Painters were a {{group of}} Scandinavian artists <b>who</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> area every summer from the late 1870s until {{the turn of the}} century. They were {{attracted}} by the scenery, the fishermen and the quality of light which encouraged them to paint en plein air following the example of the French Impressionists while sometimes adopting the Realist approach of the Barbizon School. They broke away from the rigid traditions of the Danish and Swedish art academies, preferring the modern trends they had experienced in Paris.|$|E

5|$|The camp's {{commanding}} officer Major General J.

The projected expense of the project was $35,000. At first, Berlin called in favors from civilian colleagues to visit and put on local performances to boost morale, but news of a Navy fundraising show on Broadway called Boom Boom inspired Berlin to request permission to write and stage a full Broadway production of their own.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} {{has been the}} subject of folklore in the surrounding area for several hundred years and possibly more than a millennium. Its construction was commonly attributed to a giant known as Wade, a figure from Germanic or Norse mythology. In the 1720s the causeway was mentioned in a published text and became known outside the local area. Within a few years it became of interest to antiquarians <b>who</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> site and exchanged commentary on its probable historicity. They interpreted the structure as a causeway across marshy ground, attributing its construction to the Roman military, an explanation largely unchallenged throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.|$|E
5|$|To {{the sailors}} <b>who</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> Mascarene islands from 1598 onwards, the fauna was mainly {{interesting}} from a culinary standpoint. Of the eight or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet has survived. The others likely all vanished {{due to a}} combination of extensive hunting and deforestation. Due to being easily caught, the Mascarene grey parakeet was often hunted in abundance by early visitors to Mauritius and Réunion. As they fattened themselves from June to September, they were particularly sought after {{at this time of the}} year. An account by Admiral Steven van der Hagen from 1606 even suggests that the grey parrots of Mauritius were sometimes killed for amusement.|$|E

5|$|Under the Umayyads Gaza {{served as}} a minor {{administrative}} center. In 672 an earthquake struck the city but there are few details of its effects. Under the caliph-appointed governors, Christians and Jews were taxed, though their worship and trade continued, {{as noted in the}} writings of the bishop Saint Willibald, <b>who</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> city in 723. The year 750 saw the end of Umayyad rule in Palestine and the arrival of the Abbasids, with Gaza becoming a center for the writing of Islamic law. In 767, Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i was born in Gaza and lived his early childhood there; al-Shafi'i founded one of the prominent fiqhs (schools of law) of Sunni Islam, named Shafi'i after him.|$|E
5|$|With its {{increasing}} rarity, {{specimens of}} the great auk and its eggs became collectible and highly prized by rich Europeans, {{and the loss of}} a large number of its eggs to collection contributed to the demise of the species. Eggers, individuals <b>who</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> nesting sites {{of the great}} auk to collect their eggs, quickly realized that the birds did not all lay their eggs on the same day, so they could make return visits to the same breeding colony. Eggers only collected the eggs without embryos and typically, discarded the eggs with embryos growing inside of them.|$|E
5|$|According to Turkish {{traveller}} Evliya Çelebi, <b>who</b> <b>visited</b> <b>the</b> city in 1670, at {{that time}} there were 200 houses within the castle, 200 in the Christian eastern neighborhood of Kyçyk Varosh (meaning small neighborhood outside the castle), 150 houses in the Byjyk Varosh (meaning big neighborhood outside the castle), and six additional neighborhoods: Palorto, Vutosh, Dunavat, Manalat, Haxhi Bey, and Memi Bey, extending on eight hills around the castle. According to the traveller, the city had {{at that time}} around 2000 houses, eight mosques, three churches, 280 shops, five fountains, and five inns. From the 16th century until the early 19th century Gjirokastër {{went from being a}} predominantly Christian city to one with a Muslim majority due to much of the urban population converting to Islam alongside an influx of Muslim converts from the surrounding countryside.|$|E
