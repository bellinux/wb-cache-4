5|$|The visible {{surface of}} the Sun, the {{photosphere}}, is the layer below which the Sun becomes opaque to visible light. Above the photosphere visible sunlight is free to propagate into space, {{and almost all of}} its energy escapes the Sun entirely. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H− ions, which absorb visible light easily. Conversely, the visible light <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce H− ions.|$|E
25|$|When {{we hear a}} car honk, {{we would}} {{determine}} which car triggers the honk by which car <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> the spatially closest to the honk. It's a spatial congruent example by combining visual and auditory stimuli. On the other hand, {{the sound and the}} pictures of a TV program would be integrated as structural congruent by combining visual and auditory stimuli. However, if the sound and the pictures were not meaningfully fit, we would segregate the two stimuli. Therefore, whether spatial or structural congruent should not only combine the stimuli but also be determined by understanding.|$|E

[...] In contrast to Ciment's reading of a cut to a serene [...] "other extreme of civilization", science fiction novelist Robert Sawyer, speaking in the Canadian documentary 2001 and Beyond, saw it as a cut from a bone to a nuclear weapons platform, explaining that [...] "what <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> not how far we've leaped ahead, what <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> that today, '2001', and four million years ago on the African veldt, it's exactly the same—the power of mankind is the power of its weapons. It's a continuation, not a discontinuity in that jump." ...|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} {{diffusion}} damping is greatly augmented by the finite {{width of the}} surface of last scattering (SLS). The finite width of the SLS means the CMB photons <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>were</b> not all emitted at the same time, and the fluctuations <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>are</b> not all in phase. It also means that during recombination, the diffusion length changed dramatically, as the ionisation fraction shifted.|$|R

500|$|On November 12, 2016, Valencia {{was traded}} to the Seattle Mariners in {{exchange}} for pitcher Paul Blackburn.

500|$|In {{the case}} of Weber's {{critique}} of the left, he complained that {{the leaders of the}} leftist Spartacus League which was led by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg and controlled the city government of Berlin while Weber was campaigning for his party: [...] "We have this [...] revolution to thank for the fact that we cannot send a single division against the Poles. All <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> dirt, muck, dung, and horse-play—nothing else. Liebknecht belongs in the madhouse and Rosa Luxemburg in the zoological gardens.” [...] Weber was at the same time critical of the Versailles Treaty which he believed unjustly assigned [...] "war guilt" [...] to Germany when it came to World War I. [...] Weber believed that many countries were guilty of starting World War I, not just Germany. [...] In making this case, Weber argued that “In {{the case of}} this war there is one, and only one power that desired it under all circumstances through its own will and, according to their political goals required: Russia. [...] …It never crossed [...] mind that a German invasion of Belgium [...] was nothing but an innocent act {{on the part of the}} Germans." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{cover sleeve}} and images were shot by Ellen von Unwerth. The cover was {{released}} by Jive Records on October 12, 2007. It features Spears sporting black hair and wearing a pink (blue in the rear cover) dress, and a white fedora. A reviewer for the Ottawa Citizen felt the design was [...] "horrendous". The centerfold pictures feature Spears and a priest in suggestive poses in a confessional. The first image shows Spears, who wears a cross and fishnet stockings, sitting on the priest's lap, while in the second one she leans suggestively against the confessional with the priest sitting {{on the other side}} of the partition. After the album was released, the Catholic League's director of communications Kiera McCaffrey stated that the group considered the photos a [...] "cheap publicity stunt" [...] to promote the album and condemned Spears for [...] "mocking a Catholic sacrament". McCaffrey added: [...] "All <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> how troubled this girl is now, especially with her family, losing her kids, with her career on a downward slide. And now she's put out this album and this is her tactic to promote it?" [...] Gil Kaufman of MTV said that the images were reminiscent of Madonna's music video for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] (1989). The booklet also contains pictures of empty chairs with ripped tabloid pages and still images from the music video for [...] "Gimme More". The album doesn't include a thank-you list, unlike her previous albums.|$|E
2500|$|Absence, emptiness, nothingness, and {{unresolved}} mysteries {{are central}} features in many Absurdist plots: for example, in The Chairs an old couple welcomes {{a large number}} of guests to their home, but these guests are invisible so all <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>is</b> empty chairs, a representation of their absence. [...] Likewise, the action of Godot is centered around the absence of a man named Godot, for whom the characters perpetually wait. [...] In many of Beckett's later plays, most features are stripped away and what's left is a minimalistic tableau: a woman walking slowly back and forth in Footfalls, for example, or in Breath only a junk heap on stage and the sounds of breathing.|$|E

[...] Treatises were written to discuss its possibility, either as refutations or expressing doubts about Ptolemy's arguments against it. At the Maragha and Samarkand observatories, the Earth's rotation was discussed by Tusi (b. 1201) and Qushji (b. 1403); the arguments and evidence they used resemble those used by Copernicus.|$|E

In the 12th century, Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji proposed a complete alternative to the Ptolemaic system (although not heliocentric).
