50|$|Baddiel {{has written}} four novels, Time for Bed (1996), Whatever Love Means (2002), The Secret Purposes (2006) and The Death of Eli Gold (2011). In June 2015, Baddiel {{published}} his first children’s novel, The Parent Agency {{which won the}} LOLLIE award (formally the Roald Dahl Funny Book Awards) for ‘best laugh out loud book for 9-13 year olds’ and is now being developed into a feature film by, also written and produced by Baddiel, by Fox 2000 Pictures. His subsequent children’s novels include The Person Controller (2015), AniMalcolm (2016) and The Boy Who Could do What He Liked, a short story published for World Book Day 2016. In 2001, Baddiel wrote and starred in Baddiel's Syndrome, a sitcom for Sky 1 which also starred Morwenna Banks, Stephen Fry and Jonathan Bailey which ran for fourteen episodes. He also wrote the hit comedy film, The Infidel, starring Omid Djalili, Richard Schiff, Matt Lucas and Miranda Hart. Baddiel has since adapted the film into a musical with music by Erran Baron Cohen. Baddiel directed the production which ran at London’s Theatre Royal Stratford East in late 2014. Baddiel’s other writing credits include The Norris McWhirter Chronicles for Sky 1 which starred Alistair McGowan and John Thomson and which Baddiel also directed, and two episodes of the ITV reboot of Thunderbirds, Thunderbirds Are Go! In 2004 Baddiel created and hosted Heresy, a BBC Radio 4 panel show which sees celebrity guests trying to overthrow popular prejudice and received wisdom. The show is currently in its 10th series, and has been hosted by Victoria Coren since 2008, with Baddiel returning regularly as a guest. In 2014 Baddiel created and hosted Don’t Make Me Laugh a new panel show for Radio 4 which tasks guests with talking {{for as long as}} possible on obviously humorous subjects without getting laughs. The second series aired in 2016. In 2015, he created and fronted David Baddiel Tries to Understand..., a BBC Radio 4 show which sees Baddiel try to understand famously complex subjects as suggested by his followers on Twitter. Baddiel has appeared in shows including Little Britain, Skins, The Life of Rock with Brian Pern and Horrible Histories and is a regular guest on panel shows including 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, QI and Alan Davies’ As Yet Untitled. In 2016, he fronted a four-part travel documentary for Discovery entitled David Baddiel On the Silk Road, a 4,000 mile journey to explore the most famous trade route in history, as well as presenting two episodes of BBC2’s Artsnight and becoming a regular present of The Penguin Podcast in which he interviews authors and the objects that inspired their books which has seen him interview guests including Johnny Marr, Zadie Smith and Ruby Wax. Other documentaries he has fronted include Baddiel and the Missing Nazi Billions (BBC2), <b>Who</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> Your Child to Be? (BBC2), World’s Most Dangerous Roads (BBC2) and an episode of Who Do You Think You Are? (BBC1).|$|E

Stated simply, Future Best Self aims to increase well-being by helping people craft powerful positive images of their best futures. This paper is presented in three parts: Part 1 (Future Best Self: <b>Who</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> to Be When You Grow Up?) is written as the opening chapter of a book for the general public. It provides an introduction to and overview of the Future Best Self intervention. Part 2 (Appendix A – Life Crafting: An Agentic Model of Life Path Selection) offers a position paper describing a new framework for life planning based on recent research in positive psychology. In short, life crafting theory describes how we filter a bevy of internally and externally derived interests – {{through a process of}} investigation, imagination, and integration – into a series of intentions aimed at building lives of lasting well-being. Finally, part 3 (Appendix B – Writing Well: The Symbiotic Relationship between Writing and Well-Being) offers a second position paper exploring the extensive connections between writing and well-being. It will show that writing can improve well-being, that well-being can improve writing, and that together they can create a virtuous cycle.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{acquisition}} of long-distance questions and the principles of Universal Grammar that govern them (Chomsky 1981; 1986). The questions under investigation are all ones in which a Wh-phrase is moved from an embedded clause, leaving a Wh-trace at the extraction site. Using an elicited production methodology, it is demonstrated that even three-year-old children readily produce a variety of long-distance questions. The methodology is refined to probe children 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge of two principles that constrain production of long-distance questions. One principle governs wanna contraction, prohibiting contraction across a Wh-trace in extracting from infinitival clauses, as in (1). The second principle, the Empty Category Principle (ECP), restricts extraction from {{the subject of a}} tensed embedded clause, ruling out questions like (2) with an overt complementizer (that) :^ (1) *Who do you wanna help you? (cf. <b>Who</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to help you?) ^ (2) *Who do you think that 2 ̆ 7 s in the box? (cf. Who do you think is in the box?) ^ Another methodology, the Truth Value Judgment task, supplements the data from elicited production by studying a constraint that restricts the meanings that can be assigned to long-distance questions. This constraint of 2 ̆ 2 Strong Crossover 2 ̆ 2 prohibits Wh-movement over a pronoun with the same index, ruling out a bound interpretation of the pronoun, as indicated in (3) :^ (3) *Who i does he i think t i has a hat? (cf. Who i thinks he i has a hat?) ^ The findings were that children adhered to the constraints on wanna contraction and Strong Crossover. In extracting from tensed clauses, however, several children consistently produced ungrammatical questions like (2), in apparent violation of the ECP. Other non-adult questions like (4) appeared. I call these 2 ̆ 2 medial-Wh 2 ̆ 2 questions. ^ (4) Who do you think who 2 ̆ 7 s in the box?^ To explain the problematic data, I explore several current formulations of the ECP. A version by Rizzi (1990) is seen to provide a unified explanation of children 2 ̆ 7 s exceptional questions of both kinds. In this framework, these questions are not interpreted as ECP violations but, rather, as attempts by children to preserve the ECP. In sum, the findings support the view that, by three, children have mastered long-distance movement questions and the constraints that apply to them. ...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the current}} {{approaches}} to universal grammar, those {{within the framework}} of the Extended Standard Theory have been considered as promising by a number of transformationalists. In this theory, the transformational component "Move " maps D- structures onto S- structures leaving behind traces which are coindexed with the roved elements. "Move a" represents both "Move NP" and "Move wh-phrase ". In this framework, a large number of phenomena involving WH-Movement and traces have been accounted for. One interesting case is the to contraction phenomenon in English. A familiar example of the phenomenon can be seen in the contraction of "want + to → wanna", and the following are, according to Chomsky and Lasnik (1977), the cases which involve traces (indicated as t) left behind by WH- Movement (i. e., (3), (4)) : (1) I want to meet John. (2) I want Mary to meet John. (3) <b>Who</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to meet t? (4) <b>Who</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> t to meet John? (5) Who do you wanna meet t? (6) *Who do you wanna meet John? where sentences of the type in (3) and (4) are derived from sentences like (1) and (2), respectively, (ignoring the difference in subjects) by WH- Movement. The contraction in question is observed in (5) and (6), which are the contracted versions of (3) and (4), respectively. WH- Movement leaves traces in (3) and (4) as shown in (7) and (8) : (7) [who [do you want [to meet t]]] (8) [who [do you want [t to meet John]]] Chomsky and Lasnik claim that the trace left by WH- Movemrent in (8) intervenes between want and to, which makes the contraction impossible. On the other hand, the trace in (7) does not cone between want and to, hence, contraction may take place (cf. (5)). 142 Jaeggli (1980) refines this account for to contraction phenomena by distinguishing between two kinds of traces, i. e., Case-marked versus non-Case-marked trace. Only Case-marked traces, i. e., traces of WH- Movement, prevent contraction, whereas traces which are not Case- marked allow the contraction. The crucial cases of the latter involve contraction in semiauxiliaries, where the trace is left by Raising. ' At this point, we should ask the question: can contraction phenomena be generalizable {{within the framework of}} trace theory? In other words, can trace theory be extended to account for contraction phenomena in general? If we assume that contraction phenomena cannot be generalized, the to constraction phenomenon would be an idiosyncratic feature, and could be treated in the lexical domain by considering the contracted forms as independent entries in the lexicon. On the other hand, if we assume that the phenomena can be generalized, trace theory should account for other contractions such an auxiliary contraction as well as the to contraction phenomenon. Although the choice between the two assumptions seems to be theory -dependent, we will take the latter assumption in this paper; that is, contraction phenomena can be generalized. Given this assumption, we encounter a problem with auxiliary contraction phenomena. Consider the following: (9) a. Who t has seen John? b. Who's seen John? where t in (9 a) is the trace of WH-Movement, and (9 b) is the contracted version of (9 a). While trace theory accounts for the contraction phenomenon in (5) -(6) on the one hand, it would wrongly predict that the trace in (9 a), which is left behind by WH-Movement, prevents the contraction between who and has on the other hand, since the trace in (9 a) is Case - marked, and is supposed to prevent the contraction. Provided that we continue assuming trace theory can account for contraction phenomena in general, we might posit the contraction revealed in (9) is attributed to other assumptions underlying the derivation of the sentences of (9). One such assumption I would like to examine in this paper has to do with WH-Movement from subject position. Thus far, when we assume "Move wh-phrase" in core grammar for English, we have also assumed movement from subject position as in (9) as well as from object position (e. g. (3)). On the other hand, if we suppose that WH- Movement does not apply to subject position in a root sentence, preserving the generalization of contraction phenomena within the framework of trace theory, the problem with regard to the auxiliary contraction as seen in (9) does not arise, since no trace intervenes between the two elements to be contracted. Besides the problem stated above, WH- Movement from this position raises other problems, which I will discuss in Section 3. Given the above outline of the discussion, in Section 2, I would like to propose the hypothesis that WH- Movement does not apply to subject position in a root sentence (call it the No WH-Movement Hypothesis). The rest of the discussion consists of the following two sections: in Section 1, a set of counterexamples are presented to the trace theory account for contraction phenomena, assuming the phenomena are generalizable, and some attempts are made to solve the problem with respect to the auxiliary contraction as in (9), under the assumption that WH-Movement takes place in subject position; in Section 3, I will formulate a constraint on "Move wh-phrase" in order to prevent WH-Movement from subject position. Throughout this paper, I mean by subject position, the position in a root sentence...|$|E
