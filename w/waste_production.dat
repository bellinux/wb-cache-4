The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage.

Concrete is a material that consisting of cements, aggregates, sand and water which can be a structure that becomes stronger in terms of compression pressure and durability at a time. Many research has been done to produce concrete that is affordable, high quality and profitable. The environmental regulation have initiated in increasing interest in using waste disposal as a construction materials partially replacing the water in concrete with wastewater from industries.
