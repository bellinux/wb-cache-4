40|$|This study {{evolved as}} the third cycle of a {{specific}} action research project to improve teaching skills and the student experience. The overall aim was to promote deeper, work-relevant learning through implementing a new method of assessment (data from the previous action research cycles indicated that the former assessment task promoted rote and surface learning). The study, supported by a peer assisted teaching scheme, combined participative action learning-action research (PALAR) and to change an assessment piece from a traditional multi-choice test to an innovative work integrated learning audio recording task that tested application of theory to a simulated real-world task. Domestic and international students (119) in an international marketing course collaborated in teams to develop skills in radio interviewing. Student responses to the change were assessed quantitatively (a specific question in the formal student feedback instrument) and qualitatively (open-ended questionnaires and a focus group). Of the 88 respondents to the specific question, 60 % thought the task was moderately, very or extremely important to their learning. Major themes from the NVivo qualitative analysis <b>were</b> <b>teamwork,</b> engagement and communication; creative and deeper learning experiences; practical and work-related assessment; and enjoyable and fun learning.

The 5 hypothetically influential factors <b>were</b> <b>teamwork,</b> curriculum, school support, government support, and stakeholders’ attitudes. Teachers from half-day kindergarten and full-day childcare centre settings in Hong Kong with varying teaching experience were surveyed (N = 461). Confirmatory factor analysis defined the 5 distinct factors, all of which displayed high scores (Ms 3 ̆e 4 on a 5 -point scale). A 2 (experience: low; high) x 2 (school type: half-day kindergarten; full-day childcare centre settings) {{multivariate analysis of variance}} (MANOVA) found some subtle group differences. Less experienced teachers found stakeholders’ attitudes to be important, and more so than more experienced teachers, whereas full-day childcare centre teachers found teamwork, curriculum, and stakeholders’ attitudes more important than did half-day kindergarten teachers. The findings imply that whereas all 5 factors are perceived by teachers as important for the success of inclusive education, some factors are of greater concern to teachers working in full-day childcare centres than teachers working in half-day kindergartens.

40|$|Training dentists {{today is}} {{challenging}} {{as they are}} expected to provide a wide range of dental care. In the provision of good dental care, soft skills are equally important as clinical skills. Therefore in dental education the development of soft skills are of prime concern. This study sought to identify the development of soft skills when dental students are paired in their clinical training. In this perception study, four open-ended items were used to elicit students' feedback on the appropriateness of using clinical pairing as an instructional strategy to promote soft skills. The most frequently cited soft skills <b>were</b> <b>teamwork</b> (70 %) and communication (25 %) skills. However, both negative and positive behaviours were reported. As for critical thinking and problem solving skills, more positive behaviours were reported for abilities such as to explain, analyze, find ideas and alternative solutions, and make decisions. Leadership among peers was not evident as leading without legitimate authority could be a hindrance to its development. If clinical pairing is to be used as an effective instructional strategy to promote soft skills amongst students, clear guidelines need to be developed to prepare students to work in a dental team and the use of appropriate assessment tools can facilitate the development of these soft skills...|$|E

40|$|Background Patient {{safety is}} {{critical}} component of health care quality. We aimed to assess the awareness of primary healthcare staff members about patient safety culture and explore the areas of deficiency and opportunities for improvement concerning this issue. Methods : This descriptive cross sectional study surveyed 369 staff members in four primary healthcare centers in Kuwait using self-administered “Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture” adopted questionnaire. The total number of respondents was 276 participants (response rate = 74. 79 %). Results : Five safety dimensions with lowest positivity (less than 50 %) were identified and these are; the non – punitive response to errors, frequency of event reporting, staffing, communication openness, center handoffs and transitions with the following percentages of positivity 24 %, 32 %, 41 %, 45 % and 47 % respectively. The dimensions of highest positivity <b>were</b> <b>teamwork</b> within the center’s units (82 %) and organizational learning (75 %). Conclusion : Patient safety culture in primary healthcare settings in Kuwait is {{not as strong as}} improvements for the provision of safe health care. Well-designed patient safety initiatives are needed to be integrated with organizational policies, particularly the pressing need to address the bioethical component of medical errors and their disclosure, communication openness and emotional issues related to them and investing the bright areas of skillful organizational learning and strong team working attitudes.     </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to explore {{clinician}} perspectives on patient decision-making in multidisciplinary care for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in an attempt to identify factors influencing decision-making. Methods: Thirty-two health professionals from two specialized multidisciplinary ALS clinics participated in individual and group interviews. Participants came from allied health, medical, and nursing backgrounds. Interviews were audio recorded, and the transcripts were analyzed thematically. Results: Respondents identified barriers and facilitators to optimal timing and quality of decision-making. Barriers related to the patient and the health system. Patient barriers included difficulties accepting the diagnosis, information sources, and the patient-carer relationship. System barriers were timing of diagnosis and symptom management services, access to ALS-specific resources, and interprofessional communication. Facilitators <b>were</b> <b>teamwork</b> approaches, supported by effective communication and evidence-based information. Conclusion: Patient-centered and collaborative decision-making is influenced by a range of factors that inhibit the delivery of optimal care. Decision-making relies on a fine balance between timing of information and service provision, and the readiness of patients to receive them. Health system restrictions impacted on optimal timing, and patients coming to terms with their condition. Clinicians valued proactive decision-making to prepare patients and families for inevitable change. The findings indicate disparity between patient choices and clinician perceptions of evidence, knowledge, and experience. To improve multidisciplinary ALS practice, and ultimately patient care, further work is required to bridge this gap in perspectives. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Objective The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to conduct a baseline assessment of patient safety culture in Lebanese hospitals. Design The study adopted a cross-sectional research design and utilized the hospital survey on patient safety culture (HSOPSC). Setting Sixty-eight Lebanese hospitals participated in the study (54 % of all hospitals). Participants A total of 6807 hospital employees participated in the study including hospital-employed physicians, nurses, clinical and non-clinical staff, and others. Main Outcome Measures The HSOPSC measures 12 composites of patient safety culture. Two of the composites (frequency of events reported and overall perception of safety), in addition to questions on patient safety grade and number of events reported, are the four outcome variables. Results Survey respondents were primarily employed in medical and surgical units. The dimensions with the highest positive ratings <b>were</b> <b>teamwork</b> within units, hospital management support for patient safety, and organizational learning and continuous improvement, while those with lowest ratings included staffing and non-punitive response to error. Approximately 60 % of respondents reported not completing any event reports in the past 12 months and over 70 % gave their hospitals an ‘excellent/very good’ patient safety grade. Bivariate and multivariate analysis revealed significant differences across hospitals of different size and accreditation status. Conclusions Study findings provide evidence that can be used by policy makers, managers and leaders who are able to create the culture and commitment needed to identify and solve underlying systemic causes related to patient safety.

40|$|Background: The {{skills and}} {{competencies}} of the {{professionals in the}} supply chain sector have been highlighted since the 1960 s as an area of academic interest. In modern days there are reports and articles highlighting a “skills-gap” between employers’ requirements and business graduates. In the meanwhile youth unemployment is a contemporary, acknowledged European problem and therefore there shouldn’t be a gap between supply and demand of young talents. Therefore it raises questions as to why employers report lack of young talents {{and at the same}} time youth unemployment is on the rise. Purpose: The present thesis will answer part of the abovementioned questions. More specifically it will measure the part of employers’ expectations. For that reason it will investigate in a transparent and systematic way, the requirements that employers state they expect from business graduates within the supply chain function through published job advertisements. Method: Empirical data consist of 60 publically available job advertisements aiming at supply chain graduates. The collected empirical data were analysed by the means of quantitative content analysis and then cluster analysis. Results and conclusion: The contemporary supply chain graduate is expected to demonstrate an all-around personality. The most frequently requested skills <b>were</b> <b>teamwork,</b> problem-solving ability, effective communication, English, and having a responsible, mature and professional attitude. Suggestions for future research: A longitudinal study in a broader linguistic context would raise awareness on emerging skills and track changes over time...|$|E

Phase 1 was conducted prior to the Libyan revolution. This was a quantitative research study, which used the Survey of Hospital Patient Safety Culture (HSOPSC) that {{was developed by the}} US Agency for Health Care Research and Quality (AHRQ, 2004). Phase 2 was conducted post revolution and it was a qualitative research study, which used semi-structured interviews. Setting: The three largest hospitals which were located in the Northeast of Libya were involved in the study. Participants and sampling: Phase 1 of the study included a stratified sample of 346 health care workers who were working as Doctors, Nurses, Technicians, Pharmacists and Managers. Phase 2 of the study used a purposeful sample which involved 27 health care workers from those took part in the survey study. Main Outcome Measures: The survey measured twelve Patient Safety Culture dimensions. It indicated that ten of the twelve dimensions were weak and need to be improved. The interview findings also showed that the 12 patient safety culture dimensions were very weak and shed light on some of the reasons for this sub-optimal practice. Findings: The respondents {{who took part in the}} study were from different departments in the three hospitals.

40|$|Aim: The study aim was {{to profile}} the issues and {{activities}} of critical care nurses and professional critical care nursing organizations (CCNOs), and to identify expectations {{of the role of}} the World Federation of Critical Care Nurses. This information will determine how the critical care nursing specialty is changing over time and assist to formulate strategies that provide ongoing support to critical care nursing internationally. Background: This study is the third worldwide review of CCNOs. Two previous surveys were undertaken in 1999 - 2000 and in 2005. Data were collected from 23 and 51 countries, respectively. Methods: An online descriptive survey was e-mailed to 97 countries with CCNOs or known nursing leaders. Responses were analysed descriptively by geographical region. Results: Sixty-five respondents completed the questionnaire, achieving a 67 % return rate. The most common issues identified <b>were</b> <b>teamwork,</b> access to educational programmes, formal practice guidelines/competencies, staffing levels and working conditions. Respondents perceived professional representation, national conferences, practice standards/guidelines, educational course standards, website provision, skills courses and educational workshops as the most important activities that should be provided by national CCNOs. Furthermore, less affluent countries showed greater emphasis on educational and training needs compared with wealthier counties and had poorer access to Internet and other supportive infrastructure. Conclusions: Teamwork, education, development of practice guidelines and workforce remain important issues to critical care nurses and have changed very little over the last 10 years, although the emphasis on teamwork is stronger than a decade ago. Differences in emphasis occur between affluent and less affluent countries and need to be acknowledged. Future research is recommended to better understand those priorities to enable the global community of critical care nurses to respond constructively.

In order to conduct this study, a survey was designed and administered anonymously to a sample of the professors most receptive to educational innovation at their own university. All total, 80 professors responded to this survey, of whom 26 % turned out to be members of the university’s own evaluation innovation group ([URL] GRAPA. This percentage represents 47 % of the total GRAPA membership, meaning that nearly half of the professors most concerned about evaluation at the university chose to participate. The analysis of the variables carried out using the statistical program SPSS v 19 shows that for practically 49 % of those surveyed, rubrics are the tools most commonly used to assess generic competencies integrated in more specific ones. Of those surveyed, 60 % use them either frequently or always. The most frequently evaluated generic competencies <b>were</b> <b>teamwork</b> (28 %), problem solving (26 %), effective oral and written communication (24 %) and autonomous learning (13 %), all of which constitute commonly recognized competencies in the engineering profession. A two-dimensional crosstabs analysis with SPSS v 19 shows a significant correlation (Asymp. Sig. 0. 001) between the type of tool used and the competencies assessed. However, no significant correlation was found between the type of assessment tool used and the type of subject, type of evaluation (formative or summative), frequency of feedback given to the students or the degree of student satisfaction, and thus none of these variables can be considered to have an influence on the kind of assessment tool used.

The essential learning aims of the course <b>were</b> <b>teamwork,</b> multidisciplinary collaboration, global perspective, industry and business foresight, and scenario building. The passing the Bit Bang course required active attendance at the lectures and seminars as well as writing this joint publication based on the autumn and spring group works. The texts were written by doctoral students presenting their views. During the academic year 2011 – 2012, the doctoral students discussed the societal, business, {{governance and}} technological phenomena that might affect the future development of the Internet. During the autumn semester, the students produced reports on the following four topics: Are We All Criminals?, Back to the Future – Prediction of incremental and disruptive innovations, From Democratizing Innovation to Innovating Democracy, and Proliferation of the Crowdsourcing Phenomenon. The textbooks for the autumn semester were the previous Bit Bang publications (I-III) and Wireless Foresight – Scenarios of the mobile world in 2015 by Bo Karlson et al. (2003). Distinguished guest lecturers from industry and academia complemented the textbook material. The spring teamwork topics were: Internet, Find Me a Job!, Gamification of Life: The rise of gaming and its effects on society, How to Control the Internet? – A complexity perspective, and Education Reloaded: From Socrates to Udacity. The textbook for the spring semester was Born Digital – Understanding the first generation of digital natives by John Palfrey and Urs Gasser (2008).

40|$|The present Bachelor thesis „The Role, Position and Contents of Work in the Organization” {{belongs in}} a series {{consisting}} of three bachelor thesis, where all papers had a different focus {{based on the same}} source material. The aim was to find new input info for The Institute of Journalism and Communication Master’s studies program. The overall aim of this paper was to chart the everyday work of Communication Masters of the Institute of Journalism and Communication – which everyday problems do they have at work, what challenges do they face and which professional roles they have gained in different organizations. The research based on 15 in-depth interviews, which had a similar questionnaire. The questionnaires were conducted with alumni of the master degree of communication management (graduating from 2005 to 2009). Sample was made of everybody, whose work was related to media and communications. Those, who had already done a lot of work and helped the Institute of Journalism and Communications, were left out. Those, who weren’t in Estonia, were also left out of the final selection. The qualitative content analyses method was used. The first part of this paper concentrated on theoretical concepts, research questions and explaining the research method. The bigger part of the thesis concentrated on analyzing the interviews. In this paper I used four bigger content analyses categories: the names of professions of the Communication Masters; the character and the main mission at work; teamwork; position in organizations and communication professional’s prototypes. Based on the 15 interviews, which were taken with the Communication Masters of Tartu University, the respondents could be divided into five by professions: the managers of private sector, the managers of public sector, the specialists of private sector, the specialists of public sector and leader of CEO-s of private companies. In later analysis it appeared, that the names of professions and content of work weren’t always the same. When the chart of prototypes was drawn, different positions of work were discovered: business manager or manager of some field, communication manager of public sector, communication manager of private sector, press representative of greater organization, the leader/owner of the communication bureau, communication bureau consultant, communication specialist of international organization and journalist. One of the most interesting discovery in this paper was the description of group deciding process by Vari and Vecsenyi (1984), {{what appeared to be the}} same as the outcome of the analysis of the in-depth interviews. I came to a conclusion, that the Communication Masters of Tartu University played three different roles in different organizations: commanding, intruding and supporting role. The main key-words, which were used by the Communication Masters of Tartu University describing everyday work <b>were</b> <b>teamwork</b> and media communication. The main working partners and team members of the respondents were communication apartments, the whole organizations with other apartments, journalists, clients and other partners outside the organization. When refer to the most expressive quotations in this paper, nothing in communications work can be done individually as solo-projects. It is important, that the teamwork of organizations is effectively planned, regular and always done on certain purpose. So to conclude, it can be said, that the differences in work of the Communication Masters of Tartu University are coming from organizations area and positions. When different theoretical and empirical materials were compared, it occurred, that certain prototypes of different communications professionals are starting to appear. Accordingly, further researches could focus on more detailed description of different prototypes and give suggestions for developing the Masters program of the Institute of Journalism and Communications...|$|E
