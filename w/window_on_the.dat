5|$|A unique <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Universe enabled by Hubble are the Hubble Deep Field, Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, and Hubble Extreme Deep Field images, {{which used}} Hubble's {{unmatched}} sensitivity at visible wavelengths to create images of small patches of sky {{that are the}} deepest ever obtained at optical wavelengths. The images reveal galaxies billions of light years away, and have generated a wealth of scientific papers, providing a new <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> early Universe. The Wide Field Camera 3 improved the view of these fields in the infrared and ultraviolet, supporting the discovery {{of some of the}} most distant objects yet discovered, such as MACS0647-JD.|$|E
5|$|A one-story kitchen addition, {{built in}} 1961–1962 and {{measuring}} about , {{extends from the}} northwest side of the original 1855 house. The addition has a gabled standing seam metal roof, and its exterior is covered in white-painted board-and-batten siding. It has a vinyl bay <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southwest side, a one-over-one double-hung vinyl <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northeast side and a door (adjoining {{the wall of the}} 1855 house) on the southeast side. An enclosed board-and-batten porch, measuring about , and a shed roof extend from the front (southwest) of the kitchen addition. The original basement under the 1855 house is accessible through this porch extension. A ghost building outline on the northwest side of the 1855 house indicates an earlier structure where the present kitchen addition stands.|$|E
5|$|As {{originally}} built, the Federal-style {{house had}} three stories. The completed house had {{four or five}} parlors. It was built of unpainted, cream-colored brick. The entrance was level with the ground, with an oriel window above it {{on the second floor}} and a Palladian <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third floor above that. An oval portico protected visitors arriving at the front doors.|$|E

50|$|It is a one-story brick {{building}} with a side tower. It featured green-painted wood shingles in its gable ends and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tower. Wide, overhanging boxed eaves seem {{to be consistent with}} Prairie School style. It has fifty-six-over-one <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front, fifty-six-over-four <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side, and one-over-one <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back.|$|R
50|$|This {{room without}} {{woodwork}} had three <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{side of the}} floor and two French <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the courtyard allowing to reach the balcony. The mantelpiece was of Campanian green marble.|$|R
5|$|The chapel's {{iconography}} pays tribute {{in places}} {{to the other}} Abrahamic religions. Abraham himself is depicted in a stained glass <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{north side of the}} nave, together with a Star of David, a Christian cross, and a star and crescent. Other windows show Baruch Spinoza and Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi; both images were planned before the chapel was built.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the 18th century, {{possibly}} in 1753, the upper and lower halves of the tower were divided into two separate areas. The spiral staircase from the ground floor kitchen to the upper floors, holding the records, was removed, and a <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor was turned into a doorway so that the upper floors could be accessed from the neighbouring house. A fire-resistant stone vaulted ceiling was installed in on the first floor, possibly also in 1753 at a cost of £350.|$|E
5|$|Fixtures {{include a}} marble font which is {{contemporary}} with the church. There is much stained glass: the oldest, {{in the form}} of heraldic emblems in cartouches, dates from 1562 and is visible in the Diocletian window in the east wall and in another <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southwest side. The east window was erected in memory of Sir Frank Stapleton, rector of Mereworth 1832–74. Other similar glass dates from the 17th and 18th centuries. Another, depicting the Raising of Lazarus, was designed by Frederic Shields for the Heaton, Butler and Bayne firm in 1889.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} enhance {{this feeling of}} lightness, Gropius and Meyer used a series of optical {{refinements}} like greater horizontal than vertical elements <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> longer <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> corners and taller <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> last floor.|$|R
50|$|Many {{houses have}} strikingly few and small <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground floor. The beguines were keen on their privacy. Houses with large <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground floor {{used to be}} hidden by an {{additional}} wall, as is still the case in other beguinages.|$|R

5|$|In June 1956 {{some more}} {{wreckage}} from G-ALYP was accidentally trawled up {{from an area}} about 15 miles south of where the original wreckage had been found. This wreckage was from the starboard side of the cabin just above the three front windows. Subsequent examination at Farnborough suggested that the primary failure was probably near to this area {{rather than at the}} rear automatic direction finding <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof of the cabin as had been previously thought. These findings were kept secret until the details were published in 2015.|$|E
5|$|John Nash drew up {{plans to}} alter the lodgings in 1802. His plans were not used {{immediately}} (although other work was carried out at that time) but they were partly implemented in 1884 when a north wing was added, using Milton stone. This extension was later converted into general college accommodation. An oriel <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{west side of the}} lodgings, overlooking the second quadrangle, was also added in 1884. Much of the lodgings were refaced between 1927 and 1935, using Clipsham stone on the side facing the front quadrangle in place of the original Headington stone.|$|E
5|$|Lord Rosebery had {{purchased}} Craigiehall {{as a home}} for his second son Neil Primrose MP, {{who was killed in}} Gaza during the First World War. In 1926 Rosebery therefore decided to lease the house and policies, although the agricultural lands continue to be farmed as part of Lord Rosebery's neighbouring Dalmeny estate. The lease was taken by Mr James Morton, an Edinburgh textile manufacturer, who commissioned Robert Lorimer to make various alterations, the property having stood empty for ten years. Lorimer added the oriel <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south front, and modernised many of Bruce's remaining interiors. A water turbine was constructed in the bath house to provide electricity.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{building were}} three-over-three double-hung windows with painted white frames, with smaller two-over-two <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dormer <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sixth story. The main entrance {{is flanked by}} two fluted pilasters and crowned by a molded arch and a decorative cornice. On {{either side of the}} central doorway are service entrances, still retaining their original two-over-two windows, which have been painted over. The mansard roof, unique among known extant buildings by John F. Jackson, was, according to Kate Reggev, most likely chosen for its ability to function as a roof as well as provide ample ceiling heights and dormer <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top floor and to distinguish the building from its neo-Classically detailed, metal-corniced residential neighbors.|$|R
50|$|<b>Windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{front of}} the {{building}} outside the portico are sets of three one-over-one double-hung <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> each floor. <b>The</b> second floor windows each have decorative sills, and relief panels sit below. <b>Windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east and west sides of the building, including the wing additions, have only two windows per set. Entries are finished similarly to the front, Corinthian pilasters supporting a bracketed cornice.|$|R
50|$|The Democrat Printing & Lithograph Co. Building is a {{historic}} commercial buildint at 114-122 East Second Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. It is a roughly square brick building with limestone detailing, three stories in height, built in 1924 to a design by the noted architectural firm of Sanders & Ginocchio. Its street-facing facades are articulated by brick piers with limestone caps, with plate glass <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor, groups of three sash <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second, and large multi-paned <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third.|$|R
5|$|On October 22, Schlesselman and Cowart {{shot at a}} glass <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{front door}} of the Allen Baptist Church in Brownsville, Tennessee. The two men bragged to a female friend about the shooting; the friend told her mother, who {{notified}} the Haywood County Sheriff's Department. Investigators traced the shell casings to Schlesselman and Cowart, and notified the Crockett County Sheriff's Department, who took the pair into custody after spotting the Swastikas, slurs and 88 and 14 numbers on their car.|$|E
5|$|The 33-foot {{cast iron}} spiral {{staircase}} from 1871 was repaired and restored {{for the cost}} of $15,724. The work was done by Conservation Services and they uncovered and preserved the numbering of the stairs. In October 2010, a major restoration project repainted the tower and lantern, installed ventilated steel doors, restored the original weathervane and repaired the 12-pane casement <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west wall of the lighthouse. The work was completed in March 2011 after it was suspended due to poor weather in December 2010; the total cost was $121,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower is}} {{in three stages}} and is {{supported}} by buttresses. In the lowest stage, on the west side, is a doorway in Romanesque style, {{on the north side}} is an ogee-headed lancet <b>window.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> left of the east side is a Perpendicular-style porch. The middle stage has a two-light <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west side, above which is a circular clock face, and on the north and east sides are lancet windows. The top stage contains a two-light louvred bell opening on each side. The parapet is plain, and projecting from it on the west side is a gargoyle. The spire is octagonal, with two tiers of lucarnes (dormer windows). The north side of the church is divided by buttresses into four bays. The second bay from the east contains a priest's door, above which is a lancet window. To the right of the door is a small trefoil-headed window. The other bays contain two-light windows with Early English tracery. Battlemented parapets run around the walls of the aisle walls and the clerestory. The clerestory has seven bays on either side, each containing a four-light Perpendicular window. At the east end are three windows. The central window, {{at the end of the}} chancel, is Perpendicular with seven lights. This is flanked by two aisle windows with plate tracery, the one to the right having four lights, and that to the left five lights.|$|E
50|$|These dual cab {{locomotives}} {{had four}} grilles below <b>the</b> four <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> equipment side {{and only two}} grilles below <b>the</b> centre two <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> corridor side. When observing the locomotive from the side with four grilles, the no. 1 end would be to the left.|$|R
50|$|The main {{elevation}} in the east, consists of six bodies, separated by pilasters, {{characterized by the}} type of treatment: simulating a rustic ground floor and turning into double pilasters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper floor. With open spans and regular rhythm, the bodies are differentiated by different fenestration sculptures. <b>The</b> standard <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground floor are framed by straight lintels, as are <b>the</b> bay <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1st floor, with similar framing. <b>The</b> <b>windows</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor are served by varandas, with balustrade, surmounted by triangular and rounded plinths.|$|R

5|$|Using a {{searchlight}} {{the helicopter}} crew searched {{the exterior of}} the building and at 1:17 AM February 23, the helicopter spotted a broken <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 28th floor located in an area that could not be seen from the street. At about 2:15 AM a rescue team was sent to the spot and found the three missing firefighters unconscious and out of air in their SCBAs. The firefighters were brought to a medical triage set up on the 20th floor. There were attempts at resuscitation, but they were unsuccessful and the firefighters were pronounced dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On {{the left side}} of the chassis, from top to bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left side of the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} a timber frame house that was {{originally}} constructed {{on the west side}} of Pine Street, but its original form is not known for sure due the extent of its expansion and remodeling. The NRHP nomination states that it could have been a -story gabled roof cottage with a cross-gable in the center, a style popular during the mid-century in Pawtucket. This original structure retains little of its form except for the Gothic hood moulds on the second floor end windows and the Gothic bargeboards. A two-story hipped roof addition was constructed in two phases, one completed before 1877 and the other between 1895 and 1902. Though the NRHP also states that the original house was enlarged in the late 1860s or 1870s without specification to the work done at the time. The additions include a bay <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> facade and openwork on the porch sides. The later alterations to the building worked to compliment the distinctive bargeboards of the cottage with the work on the eaves and window heads of the addition.|$|E
50|$|The Cokato Temperance Hall is {{a simple}} wood-frame {{building}} of two stories. It has a rectangular footprint of 25x45 ft, with an 8x10 ft vestibule projecting from the front façade.

5|$|The main (west) facade has a {{projecting}} {{two and a}} half-story {{gable roof}} section that is three bays wide and two deep. Decorative detail on the exterior includes quoins, the James Gibbs-inspired surround on the main entrance, and the molded surrounds and keystones of the casement windows. In {{the northwest corner of}} the intersection between the building's two sections is a one-story-high, one-bay-square addition with a narrow metal casement <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west facade and a large double entrance for horses on the north. The building's interior consists of a large riding ring that is open to the rafters, and in the gable-roofed section, there are lockers and changing rooms on the first floor and a multi-purpose room on the second; on one of its walls is a floor-to-ceiling window permitting view of the ring activity below.|$|E
5|$|The newer building, {{constructed}} in 1752 {{under the guidance}} of architects William Hiorne and his brother David, consists of five bays, with a large bay at the side, constructed around 1800 to connect it to the older building. There is a central portico, with a flat roof supported by four ionic columns, added in 1926. The tripartite windows of the ground floor contrast with the French windows of the first floor, which are fronted by cast iron balconies. The attic floor has small 4 x 2 pane windows. The rear of the house consists of four bays, with a large central <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor and a central door, surrounded with ashlar cornicing. Both sections of the house are {{constructed in}} red Flemish bond brick, which, until 1926, was covered with render.|$|E
5|$|The western {{half of the}} {{building}} is stepped forward (southwards) by two bays from the original building. Originally the service wing, it is plainer than the eastern building and dates from the Georgian era. Though using Georgian proportions, {{it was built in}} an early Jacobean revival style which has been heightened by subsequent alterations, particularly the addition of a central gable. The main part of the south (front) face has seven bays, with a balustraded parapet running along the entire façade at eaves level. In the centre of the five east bays is a canted bay window beneath a shaped gable; the flanking bays have single-mullion, double-transomed windows. The two west bays are set backwards and have a central oriel <b>window</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor with two single-mullion, double-transomed windows on the ground floor.|$|E
