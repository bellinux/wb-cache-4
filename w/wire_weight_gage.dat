The main goal here is to bring aircraft radio equipment {{as close as possible to}} the antennas in order to minimize <b>wiring</b> <b>weight</b> and complexity. This calls for a drastic volume reduction of the radio equipment. To this end, the system level requirements for the RF front-ends in terms of frequency bandwidths, data rates, etc, are first investigated in order to identify applications where the proposed volume reductions are the most beneficial and feasible. Following this, the focus was on an architectural investigation of alternative topologies that can meet the specification. For each topology considered the front-end-level specification need to be translated to circuit/component level requirements. For each case, performance, cost and technical risk analyses are carried out. Then, the design and prototyping of key RF front-end circuits for the selected architecture are undertaken. The multilayered Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) technology had to be considered as a high risk but more advantageous option in terms of volume/weight reduction. Finally, we aimed at integrating and testing the proposed RF front-end chain, first by characterizing each component individually, and then as a whole front-end subsystem...|$|R
40|$|TRIUMF is {{developing}} ISAC-II, a superconducting (SC) linac. It will comprise 9 cryomodules {{with a total}} of 48 niobium cavities and 12 SC solenoids. They must remain aligned at liquid He temperatures: cavities to ± 400 µm and solenoids to ± 200 µm after a vertical contraction of ~ 4 mm. A wire position monitor (WPM) system based on a TESLA design has been developed, built, and tested with a prototype cryomodule. The system is based on the measurement of signals induced in pickups by a 215 MHz signal carried by a wire through the WPMs. The wire is stretched between the warm tank walls parallel to the beam axis providing a position reference. The sensors, one per cavity and two per solenoid, are attached to the cold elements to monitor their motion during pre-alignment, pumping and cool down. A WPM consists of four 50 Ω striplines spaced 90 ° apart. A GaAs multiplexer scans the WPMs and a Bergoz card converts the rf signals to dc X and Y voltages. National Instruments I/O cards read the dc signals. The data acquisition is based on a PC running LabVIEW. System accuracy is ~ 7 µm.

Wireless technologies are typically extensible, offer freedom from wire tethers, readily support redundancy, offer potential for decreased <b>wire</b> <b>weight,</b> and can represent dissimilar implementation for increased reliability. In addition, wireless technologies can enable additional situational awareness {{that otherwise would}} be infeasible. For example, addition of wired sensors, the need for which {{might not have been}} apparent at the outset of a program, night be extremely costly {{due in part to the}} necessary routing of cables through the vehicle. RFID, or radio frequency identification, is a wireless technology with the potential for significant savings and increased reliability and safety in space operations. Perhaps the most obvious savings relate to the application of inventory management. A fully automated inventory management system is highly desirable for long-term sustaining operations in space environments. This assertion is evidenced by inventory activities on the International Space Station, which represents the most extensive inventory tracking experience base in the history of space operations. In the short tern, handheld RFID readers offer substantial savings owing to reduced crew time for inventory audits. Over the long term, a combination of improved RFID technology and operational concepts modified to fully utilize the technology should result in space based inventory management that is highly reliable and requires very little crew time. In addition to inventory management, RFID is likely to find space applications in real-time location and tracking systems. These could vary from coarse-resolution RFID portals to the high resolution afforded by ultra-wideband (UWB) RFID.

40|$|Electronic {{control systems}} {{have become an}} {{integral}} part of the modern vehicle and their installation rate is still on a sharp rise. Their application areas range from powertrain, chassis and body control to entertainment. Each system is conventionally control led by a centralised controller with hard-wired links to sensors and actuators. As systems have become more complex, a rise in the number of system components and amount of wiring harness has followed. This leads to serious problems on safety, reliability and space limitation. Different networking and vehicle electronic architectures have been developed by others to ease these problems. The thesis proposes an alternative architecture namely Distributed Wheel Architecture, for its potential benefits in terms of vehicle dynamics, safety and ease of functional addition. The architecture would have a networked controller on each wheel to perform its dynamic control including braking, suspension and steering. The project involves conducting a preliminary study and comparing the proposed architecture with four alternative existing or high potential architectures. The areas of study are functionality, complexity, and reliability. Existing ABS, active suspension and four wheel steering systems are evaluated in this work by simulation of their operations using road test data. They are used as exemplary systems, for modelling of the new electronic architecture together with the four alternatives. A prediction technique is developed, based on the derivation of software pseudo code from system specifications, to estimate the microcontroller specifications of all the system ECUs. The estimate indicates the feasibility of implementing the architectures using current microcontrollers. Message transfer on the Controller Area Network (CAN) of each architecture is simulated to find its associated delays, and hence the feasibility of installing CAN in the architectures. Architecture component costs are estimated from the costs of wires, ECUs, sensors and actuators. The number of wires is obtained from the wiring models derived from exemplary system data. ECU peripheral component counts are estimated from their statistical plot against the number of ECU pins of collected ECUs. Architecture component reliability is estimated based on two established reliability handbooks. The results suggest that all of the five architectures could be implemented using present microcontrollers. In addition, critical data transfer via CAN is made within time limits under current levels of message load, indicating the possibility of installing CAN in these architectures. The proposed architecture is expected to· be costlier in terms of components than the rest of the architectures, while it is among the leaders for <b>wiring</b> <b>weight</b> saving. However, it is expected to suffer from a relatively higher probability of system component failure. The proposed architecture is found not economically viable at present, but shows potential in reducing vehicle <b>wire</b> and <b>weight</b> problems...|$|R
