50|$|Resonant {{systems are}} said to be tightly coupled, loosely coupled, {{critically}} coupled or overcoupled. Tight coupling <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the coupling coefficient is around 1 as with conventional iron-core transformers. Overcoupling <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the secondary coil is so close and the formation of mutual flux is hindered by the effect of antiresonance, and critical coupling <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the transfer in the passband is optimal. Loose coupling <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the coils <b>are</b> distant from each other, so that most of the flux misses the secondary. In Tesla coils around 0.2 is used, and at greater distances, for example for inductive wireless power transmission, it may be lower than 0.01.|$|R
