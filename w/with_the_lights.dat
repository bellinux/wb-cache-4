5|$|ArtRave's {{concept and}} name {{are derived from}} the {{similarly}} named release party for Artpop. The stage resembled a cave and consisted of two sections connected by catwalks made of translucent lucite, allowing the audience to move underneath the catwalks while still being able to watch the show. Gaga's costumes in the show included one with tentacles, one with bejeweled wings, a rave-inspired outfit and a necklace made of marijuana leaves. Costume designers and choreographers aspired to make a single, coherent show. The lighting fixtures used for the concert were from Clay Paky and the main idea was to create an immersive rave experience <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights.</b> They were also designed to accommodate minor changes in the show sequences.|$|E
5|$|Ferranti {{began work}} on {{building}} the computer on 1 December 1950, with engineer Raymond Stuart-Williams adapting the design by Bennett into a working machine. Development was completed by 12 April 1951, resulting in a device twelve feet wide, nine feet deep, and five feet tall. The majority of the volume was taken up by vacuum tubes and the light bulbs that displayed {{the state of the}} game, with the actual computer taking up no more than two percent of the total volume of the machine. The Nimrod took the form of a large box with panels of lights, with a raised stand in front of it with buttons corresponding <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights,</b> which in turn represented the objects the player could remove.|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 2012, Cedar Point {{announced}} that Disaster Transport would close on July 29, 2012. It {{was the second}} roller coaster at Cedar Point to close in 2012. A charity auction was held for the final riders, benefiting the Give Kids the World charity foundation. The last ride was given at 11:53 PM on July 29, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> turned on. The ride started demolition on August 6, using about 380 trucks to transport scrap materials. A portion of track, two cars and the main entrance sign will be donated to the National Roller Coaster Museum. Less than a month later on August 29 at around 9:30 AM, the last section of Disaster Transport was demolished. The 12E {{part of the building}} was the last section left standing.|$|E

5|$|The Swedish {{automotive}} startup Uniti Sweden AB {{has been}} working on an electric city car entirely designed to be sustainable. The CEO Lewis Horne said “When people sell electric cars, the motivation is sustainability. So, why are they so heavy, and why are they the same cars? Where you just take out petrol and you put in the huge battery and you call it sustainable. But it’s not.”. The company has been designing a car that uses sustainable and recycled material such as bio-composite to reduce the footprint of the car during production. In addition, the fully automated factory provided in partnership with Siemens will be able to work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> turned off during 22h per day to save energy.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} of the wrestlers is not known. Alison Smith, Lead Curator of British Art to 1900 at Tate, speculates that the white figure may have been John Wilton of Somerset, who had possibly been the model for Little John in Daniel Maclise's 1839 Robin Hood and His Merry Men Entertaining Richard the Lionheart in Sherwood Forest. The figures glisten with sweat. Art historian Sarah Victoria Turner speculates {{that this is not}} simply for dramatic effect, but reflects the fact that after the Royal Academy's 1837 move to its new building in Trafalgar Square the studio used by the life class was a cramped and poorly ventilated room lit by gaslight, which when crowded with students and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> on could become extremely hot.|$|E
25|$|Luminous {{efficacy}} is {{the measure}} of how much light is produced versus how much energy is consumed. HID burners give higher efficacy than halogen lamps. The highest-intensity halogen lamps, H9 and HIR1, produce 2100 to 2530 lumens from approximately 70 watts at 13.2 volts. A D2S HID burner produces 3200 lumens from approximately 42 watts during stable operation. The reduced power consumption means less fuel consumption, with resultant less CO2 emission per vehicle fitted with HID lighting (1.3 g/km assuming that 30% of engine running time is <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> on).|$|E
5000|$|As {{a general}} rule, it is {{desirable}} to fish <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lightest</b> tip possible; that means <b>the</b> tip <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lightest</b> test curve.

25|$|Before the crash, the {{aircraft}} {{was involved in}} two accidents. On 14 January 2002, {{the aircraft}} was flying from Frankfurt to Novosibirsk when {{it had to be}} diverted to Omsk due to poor weather at the destination. On approach, pilots reported fuel supply problems, followed by a flameout of both engines. The aircraft glided and landed successfully, but overran the runway and collided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> after the runway threshold. There were no injuries. The aircraft was repaired and continued service. From August 2006 the aircraft was leased to various Russian airlines – Red Wings Airlines, Aviastar-TU, Interavia Airlines and then Aviastar-TU again.|$|E
25|$|Tamta premiered {{the song}} at The S Club concert series where {{she served as}} a {{supporting}} act for Rouvas, using the track as her opening number. Rouvas did not perform the song live with Tamta, as he did not appear on stage until after midnight. Instead, his vocal part was played through a recording, as Tamta lay in {{the centre of the}} stage <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> dimmed, with minimal blue lighting in the backdrop. A smoke machine is also used. As Tamta's part begins a video in the background is played featuring geometric shapes rapidly changing colours. Tamta, wearing a purple leotard, proceeds to stand during the second chorus and four female backing dancers appear and perform a choreography. The show moved to Thessaloniki on 14 May at Politia: Live Clubbin, where a similar routine was performed. Tamta also performed the song as well as others from her album at a guest appearance at Stavro Tou Notou with Isaïas Matiamba.|$|E

As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version.

500|$|The {{day before}} the case was set {{to go to trial}} in October 2002, Love, Novoselic, and Grohl {{announced}} that they had reached a settlement. The settlement {{paved the way for the}} release of the compilation album Nirvana, which featured the previously unreleased track [...] "You Know You're Right", the last song Nirvana recorded before Cobain's death. Nirvana was released later that month, debuting at number three on the Billboard album chart. The box set, <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lights</b> Out, was finally released in November 2004. The release contained a vast array of early Cobain demos, rough rehearsal recordings, and live tracks recorded throughout the band's history. , which culled 19 tracks from the box set in addition to featuring three previously unreleased tracks, was released in late 2005.|$|E
500|$|Courtney Love {{stated in}} May 2002 that she owned 109 {{unreleased}} tapes made by Cobain, {{with or without}} the other members of Nirvana.

500|$|MacDonald {{describes}} the song as [...] "Stylistically … {{the most distant}} departure from the staple Beatles sound in their discography". The basic track was recorded on 15 March 1967 at EMI's Abbey Road studio 2 in London. The participants sat on a carpet in the studio, which was decorated with Indian tapestries on the walls, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> turned low and incense burning. Harrison and Aspinall each played a tambura, while the Indian musicians contributed on tabla, dilruba, tambura and swarmandal. A type of zither, the swarmandal provided the glissando flourishes that introduce the tabla during the alap and signal the return to 16-beat tintal before the final verse. Musicologist Michael Hannan comments that, relative to standard Indian practice, the use of three tamburas produces [...] "a denser-than-usual, pulsating jivari" [...] (or [...] "buzzing sound"), highlighting the naturally rich harmonics of the instrument.|$|E

500|$|... "Dance in the Dark" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Lady Gaga, from her third EP, The Fame Monster. Inspired by Gaga's [...] "Fear of Self Monster", the song deals with the intimate experience between two people alone in a bedroom. According to Gaga, the record is about a girl who likes to have sex <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> off because she is embarrassed about her body. She explained that she came across such women while working on the MAC AIDS Fund, and that the song is not about freedom, but rather the assurance that Gaga understood their feelings. The song was initially planned to be released after [...] "Telephone", but due to a dispute between Gaga and her record company, [...] "Alejandro" [...] was released instead. It was later released as a digital download and radio-only single in Australia, Belgium, and France.|$|E
500|$|Nirvana {{first made}} a music video for [...] "In Bloom" [...] in 1990 for the Sub Pop Video Network Program VHS {{compilation}} (1991). The {{recording of the}} song featured in the video is the version recorded during the Smart Studios sessions. The Sub Pop video features the band walking around various parts of lower Manhattan including the South Street Seaport, the Lower East Side, and Wall Street. While filming the video, Novoselic shaved his head as penance for a bad performance the band gave in New York City. This caused discontinuity in the final cut; shots of the band feature the bassist with and without hair throughout the video. This video was later compiled on the Nirvana box set <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lights</b> Out (2004). The audio of this version of [...] "In Bloom" [...] was later released on CD2 of the 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition of the Nevermind album in 2011.|$|E
500|$|On February 24, 1999, Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] as {{the opening}} {{number of the}} 41st Annual Grammy Awards.

The stage had two large Japanese infrastructures on either side, a black screen, and a semi-large bench on which Madonna stood. The performance opened <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> beaming on Madonna, who wore the red Gaultier kimono, red platform boots, and black bob hairstyle. The chorus started with four back-up dancers holding plastic bag, similar to the Japanese people in the music video, and a background dancer being projected on screen. By the second chorus, Madonna's back-up vocalists started singing atop the benches wearing similar kimonos. During the song's bridge interlude, a man entered the stage and started performing with flamed rope. When Madonna won the award for Best Pop Vocal Album at the same ceremony, she came onstage with Orbit to accept the award in the red kimono.|$|E
