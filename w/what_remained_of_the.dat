Geoff Inkpen stated that after completion of an Inquiry a bulldozer would be used to dig a ditch at the crash site and <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Amana would be buried.|$|E
5|$|Another {{division}} among Christians occurred, when Leo III {{ordered the}} destruction of icons throughout the Empire. This led to a significant religious crisis, which ended in mid-9th century with the restoration of icons. During the same period, {{a new wave of}} pagans emerged in the Balkans, originating mainly from Slavic people. These were gradually Christianised, and by Byzantium's late stages, Eastern Orthodoxy represented most Christians and, in general, most people in <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empire.|$|E

5|$|The Great Southern Group {{dismantled}} much of <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company. Frederick W. Paine was {{detached from}} the LNC, along with the specialist division overseeing the exhumation and relocation of existing burial grounds to allow property development on formerly consecrated sites. All that remained of the LNC was Brookwood Cemetery itself, by this time moribund and becoming heavily overgrown. Considered virtually worthless, Great Southern sold the LNC to property speculators Maximillian Investments in July 1973 for £400,000.|$|E
5|$|The West {{responded with}} the Crusades, {{eventually}} {{resulting in the}} Sack of Constantinople by participants in the Fourth Crusade. The conquest of Constantinople in 1204 fragmented <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empire into successor states, the ultimate victor being that of Nicaea. After the recapture of Constantinople by Imperial forces, the Empire {{was little more than}} a Greek state confined to the Aegean coast. The Roman Empire finally collapsed when Mehmed the Conqueror conquered Constantinople on 29 May 1453.|$|E

5|$|After {{a fire in}} 1177, the {{original}} palace complex was abandoned and emperors resided in smaller palaces (the former sato-dairi) within the city and villas outside it. In 1227 a fire finally destroyed <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dairi, and the old Greater Palace went into complete disuse. In 1334 Emperor Go-Daigo issued an edict to rebuild the Greater Palace, but no resources were available to support this and the project came to nothing. The present Kyoto Imperial Palace is located immediately {{to the west of}} the site of the , the great Fujiwara residence in the north-eastern corner of the city. The Jingi-kan, the final standing section of the palace, remained in use until 1585.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Stuart, an Army {{captain who}} served as the last {{governor}} of the castle, stripped down <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fortification in the mid-1700s. Some of the stone was reused to build the Bowling Green House – later renamed the Castle Inn – on {{the north end of the}} tennis courts, while the north side of the outer bailey was used to make the bowling green itself. Stuart lived in a house in Ludlow itself, but decorated the Great Hall with the remains of the castle armoury, and may have charged visitors for admittance.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some work}} was done to {{strengthen}} the structure in the 1960s, the complex was allowed to fall into disrepair. Also during the 1960s, some sections of the complex began to be left unoccupied and others burned down including an engine block. During this period, parts of the complex were used for light industrial use before they too fell into disuse. In the 1990s, the buildings fell victim to vandalism and arson that threatened to destroy <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 20 September, the Eighth Ottoman Army {{had been}} pushed {{back out of the}} coastal Plain of Sharon and the Desert Mounted Corps was {{blocking}} the Seventh and <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eighth Armies' main lines of retreat northwards. The 60th Division held Tulkarm and Anebta, the 7th (Meerut) Division held the village of Beit Lid and controlled the crossroads at Deir Sheraf, while the 5th Light Horse Brigade had cut the Jenin railway south of Arrabe. Both the 3rd (Lahore) and 7th (Meerut) Divisions had continued to force the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies' retreat.|$|E
5|$|Churchill and Maxime Weygand, who {{had taken}} over command from Gamelin, were still {{determined}} to break the German line and extricate their forces to the south. When they communicated their intentions to King Leopold and van Overstraten on 24 May, the latter was stunned. A dangerous gap was starting to open between the British and Belgians between Ypres and Menen, which threatened <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Belgian front. The Belgians could not cover it; {{such a move would}} have overstretched them. Without consulting the French or asking permission from his government, Gort immediately and decisively ordered the British 5th and 50th Infantry Divisions to plug the gap and abandon any offensive operations further south.|$|E
5|$|During {{the meeting}} in Kolwezi, Tshombe had ordered all {{remaining}} Katangese armed forces to withdraw to Portuguese Angola. Jean Schramme was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury. This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the gold reserves out of the country. The last of Schramme's mercenaries and gendarmes were evacuated on 25 January. Other gendarmes spent the remainder of 1963 in Northern Rhodesia.|$|E
50|$|After McCormick's death, Fort Owen {{was owned}} by a {{succession}} of local farmers and ranchers. Eventually, the decrepit fort was donated the Stevensville Historical Society.

5|$|In July, in {{an attempt}} to salvage <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> Yugoslavia, <b>the</b> JNA forces were {{involved}} in operations against predominantly Croat areas. In July the Serb-led Territorial Defence Forces started their advance on Dalmatian coastal areas in Operation Coast-91. By early August, large areas of Banovina were overrun by Serb forces.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} words that have Germanic (probably Lombardic origins) and Celtic roots (<b>what</b> still <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{languages}} spoken before the Romans came). Examples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first category are sbregâ, to tear; sedon, spoon; taponâ, to cover. For the latter category, troi, path; bragons, trousers.|$|R
5|$|Events {{such as the}} Pentridge Rising, the March of the Blanketeers and the Spa Fields meeting, all {{serve to}} {{indicate}} the breadth, diversity and widespread geographical scale of the demand for economic and political reform at the time. Peterloo {{had no effect on}} the speed of reform, but in due course {{all but one of the}} reformers' demands, annual parliaments, were met. Following the Great Reform Act of 1832, the newly created Manchester parliamentary borough elected its first two MPs. Five candidates including William Cobbett stood, and the Whigs, Charles Poulett Thomson and Mark Philips, were elected. Manchester became a Municipal Borough in 1837, and <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manorial rights were purchased by the borough council.|$|E
5|$|In April 1942, the German Commanding General in Serbia, General der Artillerie (General) Paul Bader, issued orders giving unit numbers C39 to C101 to the Pećanac Chetnik detachments, {{which were}} put {{under the command}} of the local German {{division}} or area command post. These orders also required the deployment of a German liaison officer with all detachments engaged in operations, and limited their movement outside their assigned area. Supply of arms and ammunition was also controlled. In July 1942, Mihailović arranged for the Yugoslav government-in-exile to denounce Pećanac as a traitor. His continuing collaboration ruined <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reputation he had developed in the Balkan Wars and World War I.|$|E

In his annual budget address on October 13, 2010, Daley projected a deficit for 2010 of $655 million, the largest in city history. Daley proposed a 2011 budget totaling $6.15 billion, including spending all but $76 million of <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parking meter lease proceeds, and received a standing ovation from aldermen.|$|E

5|$|On 12 August, crusader scouts {{discovered}} {{the location of}} the Fatimid camp, which the crusaders immediately marched towards. According to most crusader and Muslim accounts, the Fatimids were caught unaware. Because of a somewhat ill-prepared Fatimid army, the battle was fairly short, although it still took some time to resolve, according to Albert of Aix. al-Afdal Shahanshah and his army retreated into the heavily guarded and fortified city of Ascalon. The next day the crusaders learned that al-Afdal Shahanshah had retreated back to Egypt via boat, so they plundered <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fatimid camp. After returning to Jerusalem most of the crusaders returned to their homes in Europe.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, news reached New York that Congress {{had voted}} for {{independence}} four days earlier. On Tuesday, July 9, at 18:00, Washington had several brigades march onto the commons {{of the city}} to hear the Declaration of Independence read. After the end of the reading, a mob ran down to Bowling Green with ropes and bars, where they tore down the gilded lead equestrian statue of George III of Great Britain. In their fury, the crowd cut off the statue's head, severed the nose, and mounted <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head on a spike outside a tavern, {{and the rest of the}} statue was dragged to Connecticut and melted down into musket balls.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Cavalry Division, {{which had}} {{advanced}} to capture Beisan {{in the afternoon}} of 20 September, now controlled the area north along the River Jordan, while the 5th Cavalry Division garrisoned Afulah and the Nazareth area.
