40|$|A {{document}} {{discusses the}} creation of a viewport suitable for use on the surface of Venus. These viewports are rated for 500 C and 100 atm pressure with appropriate safety factors and reliability required for incorporation into a Venus Lander. Sapphire windows should easily withstand the chemical, pressure, and temperatures of the Venus surface. Novel fixture designs and seals appropriate to the environment are incorporated, as are materials compatible with exploration vessels. A test cell was fabricated, tested, and leak rate measured. The window features polish specification of the sides and corners, soft metal padding of the sapphire, and a metal C-ring seal. The system safety factor is greater than 2, and standard mechanical design theory was used to size the <b>window,</b> <b>flange,</b> and attachment bolts using available material property data. Maintenance involves simple cleaning of the window aperture surfaces. The only weakness of the system is its moderate rather than low leak rate for vacuum applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of alternative details to manage water intrusion at the window-wall interface {{has produced a}} number of novel approaches to detailing the interface between the window and adjacent wall assembly. Many of these approaches advocate {{the need to provide}} drainage at the rough opening of the window subsill given that the window components themselves are susceptible to water entry over their expected life. Depending on the types of windows used and the cladding into which the windows are installed, there arise different methods to provide drainage that may also affect air leakage through the assembly. This in turn may give rise to the formation of condensation along the window at the sill or along the window sash and glazing panels. Hence {{there is a need to}} determine if, under cold weather conditions, specific interface details that incorporate sill pans provide potential for condensation on the window components in which air leakage paths may be prominent at the sill or elsewhere on the window assembly. The paper reports on a laboratory evaluation of conditions suitable for the formation of condensation at the window frame perimeter of the interface assembly as a function of both temperature deferential and air leakage rate across the test assembly. A summary of the laboratory test protocol is provided that includes a description of the test set-up and apparatus, fabrication details of the specimen and information on instrumentation and calibration and experimental results for one type of <b>window</b> (<b>flange</b> window). In parallel, preliminary simulation results were presented and compared to those obtained from experiment using the commercially available thermal software BISCO...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of vinyl nail-on {{windows in the}} North American new home construction market has prompted ASTM International to write ASTM E 2112 - 01 "Standard Practice for Installation of Exterior Windows, Doors and Skylights". This thesis focuses on the window jamb flashing recommendation in ASTM E 2112 - 01 for vinyl nail-on windows by asking {{the question of whether}} a vinyl window's integral nail-on flange is by itself an adequate jamb flashing. To answer this question, the Jamb Drip Test was designed and completed on fourteen (14) window/wall details. The answer to the question depends on the window/wall construction sequence. When the weather resistant barrier (WRB) is installed prior to the window, it isn't. When the WRB is installed after the window, the nail-on fin is by itself an adequate jamb flashing. Based on this Jamb Drip Test study, a recommended window/wall construction sequence of sheathing- flashing (sill, jamb and head) - vinyl nail-on window - WRB - siding option is proposed. This sequence recognizes that while the nail-on fin may be an adequate jamb flashing, without flashing, the designer cannot take full advantage of the symbiotic relationship between the nail-on flange and the space it creates between the adjoining building elements (e. g. sheathing and the WRB). In this capacity, jamb flashing is added to the construction sequence to protect the sheathing from wetting and aid in directing incidental water to the exterior. Based on this proposed construction sequence, effort was focused on improving the present state of the art window/wall weatherproofing detail. An alternative to the use of high performance sealant to create the seal between the flashing and the window's nail-on flange is proposed. The present recommendation uses a(cont.) one-piece folded sheet that envelops the <b>window</b> <b>flange,</b> WRB {{and at the same time}} incorporates the window flashing function. This novel, dual function (window seal + window flashing system) product is called w-Flashing. The thesis ends with a description of w-Flashing's performance attributes, prototype design and recommended installation sequence around a vinyl nail-on window. by Austin Parsons. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Work {{supported}} by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission. I ‘Thin-foil vacuum-tight windows of low 2 material are used at high energy accelerators whenever the beam passes from vacuum to air. The use of low 2 / materials ensures negligible scattering of the primary beam. These windows I are usually made of Al or Be, approximately 0. 005 ” thick and are sealed using! Indium and/or specially machined flanges or foils. Recently we required a thin foil window which was bakeable to 200 or 2 SO°C for use in an ultra-high-vacuum-‘ system designed to measure the secondary emission from low-density alkali halides at relativistic energies. The following note describes a simple solution we found to this problem. A sketch of the seal is shown in Fig. 1. The seal is accomplished by compressing a Cu gasket into the thin foil <b>window.</b> The <b>flanges</b> used were standard _ ConFlat ultra-hig...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} {{particle}} colliders {{begins in the}} early 60 's when an idea previously patented by R. Wideroe in 1953 is constructed. The design of the vacuum chamber in their experimental area became essential {{as it was the}} rst physical barrier that the particles to be detected needed to traverse. The interaction of the products of the collisions with the vacuum chamber structural materials, hindered the identification of the significative events. This Thesis analyses the historical evolution of the experimental vacuum chambers and summarizes the technical criteria that are to be fulfilled. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) presently under construction at CERN is the last generation of particle colliders. Four big experiments will be in operation (ATLAS, CMS, ALICE and LHCb) in the LHC with diferent physics objectives. In particular, LHCb will be devoted to the study of CP violation and the design of its vacuum chamber is the scope of this Thesis. Physics simulations with an initial design consisting of a conical aluminium vacuum chamber with stainless steel flanges and bellows expansion joints, foresaw redundancies in the experiment detection channels that would make it inefficient. The reduction of the radiation background generated after the interactions of the products of the proton collisions with the vacuum chamber materials became essential. Berillium became the ideal candidate as structural material for the vacuum chamber due to its excellent mechanical properties and high transparency to radiation. Nonetheless, its toxicity, difficult machining and complicated weld hampers its use. TIG welding of beryllium to beryllium and to aluminium AA 2219 was qualified for UHV applications as per ISO Norms applicable for aluminium welding. On the other hand, beryllium high price led to consider beryllium-aluminium composites for the fabrication of the LHCb vacuum chamber. The mechanical characterization of the berylliumaluminium HIP AlBeMet AM 162 at the required bakeout temperatures of 200 °C and 250 °C was completed. In turn, the electron beam welding of beryllium-aluminium to beryllium-aluminium and to aluminium AA 2219 was qualified for UHV applications following ISO Norms applicable for aluminium welding. Once characterized mechanically the materials and demonstrated the feasibility of the welding, nite element analysis were performed to design the vacuum chamber; as well as to design other special components integrated in it. The fabrication and thorough tests conducted with prototypes is described; in particular, an aluminium AA 6061 OD 860 mm window 2 mm thick that UHV seals one of the detectors, two bellows expansion joint aluminium fabricated in AA 2219 and two optimized aluminium AA 2219 UHV anges. The final design consisting of a TIG welded conical structure 12 m long fabricated in berillium with thickness ranging between 1 and 2. 4 mm, implementing the validated aluminium <b>window,</b> optimized <b>flanges</b> and bellows expansion joints, will allow a factor 5 reduction of the radiation background generated by the initial vacuum chamber allowing the study of the physics that the LHCb experiment is designed for...|$|R
