5|$|In {{the latter}} half of 2002, CIA reports {{contained}} assertions of Saddam Hussein's intent of reconstituting nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>programs,</b> not properly accounting for Iraqi biological and chemical weapons, and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions. Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to calling for cuts in federal government spending {{to help reduce}} the national debt, Romney proposed measures intended to limit the growth of entitlement programs, such as introducing means testing and gradually raising the eligibility ages for receipt of Social Security and Medicare. He supported substantial increases in military spending and promised to invest more heavily in military <b>weapons</b> <b>programs</b> while {{increasing the number of}} active-duty military personnel. He was very supportive of the directions taken by the budget proposals of Paul Ryan, although he later proposed his own budget plan.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Alsos Mission contributed {{little to}} the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany, because the German nuclear and {{biological}} <b>weapons</b> <b>programs</b> {{that it had been}} formed to investigate turned out to be smaller and less threatening than had been feared. In the field of nuclear weapons development at least, the underfunded and disorganized German program lagged far behind the Allies' own efforts. In its appropriation of the accomplishments of European science, the Alsos Mission played a small part in the wartime and subsequent scientific and technological developments that characterized and transformed the postwar world.|$|E

25|$|When Richard Nixon {{selected}} Melvin Laird as his Secretary of Defense {{in early}} 1969, Laird directed the Department of Defense {{to undertake a}} comprehensive review of U.S. biological warfare (BW) programs. Laird's push for a review of both the chemical and biological programs arose when Congress attempted to push the Pentagon for open, joint Congressional hearings on chemical-biological warfare (CBW). The Pentagon balked and the result was Laird's memo to National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger urging a review of those <b>weapons</b> <b>programs.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2011 Donnelly {{voted against}} H.R. 2219 {{which would have}} cut the U.S. {{military}} budget by $8.5 billion, stipulating that no cuts were to be taken from pay or benefit programs supporting members and veterans of the armed forces. These cuts would have reduced the emphasis of the U.S. budget on <b>weapons</b> <b>programs.</b> Donnelly also voted against the failed Polis amendment, cutting $640 Million in a 2% across-the-board reduction in spending from the 2012 Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill.|$|E
25|$|In June 1969 Kissinger asked {{a former}} Harvard colleague, Matthew Meselson {{to prepare a}} {{position}} paper on U.S. chemical and biological <b>weapons</b> <b>programs.</b> Meselson and Paul Doty then organized a private conference to discuss policy issues. The result was a September 1969 paper that not only urged U.S. ratification of the Geneva Protocol but an end to U.S. BW programs. Meselson and his colleagues argued that a biological attack would likely inflict a great toll on civilian populations while remaining largely militarily ineffective.|$|E

25|$|The United States Army re-evaluated its {{chemical}} and biological <b>weapons</b> <b>programs</b> in 1961. This re-evaluation led to a renewed focus on an incapacitating agent program. A project was established to begin producing BZ munitions; one result was the mass production of the Chemical Corps' M43 BZ cluster bomb in March 1962. Though M43s and another BZ weapon, the M44 generator cluster, were produced, they were never really considered {{an integral part of}} the U.S. chemical arsenal. In the end around 1,500 BZ munitions were produced between the M43 and the M44.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{potential}} for use in nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>programs,</b> the possession or import/export of large industrial quantities of heavy water are subject to government control in several countries. Suppliers of heavy water and heavy water production technology typically apply IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) administered safeguards and material accounting to heavy water. (In Australia, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987.) In the U.S. and Canada, non-industrial quantities of heavy water (i.e., in the gram to kg range) are routinely available without special license through chemical supply dealers and commercial companies such as the world's former major producer Ontario Hydro.|$|E
25|$|Intellipedia {{was created}} to share {{information}} {{on some of the}} most difficult subjects facing U.S. intelligence and to bring cutting-edge technology into its ever-more-youthful workforce. It also allows information to be assembled and reviewed by a wide variety of sources and agencies, to address concerns that pre-war intelligence did not include robust dissenting opinions on Iraq's alleged <b>weapons</b> <b>programs.</b> A number of projects are under way to explore the use of the Intellipedia for the creation of traditional Intelligence Community products.

25|$|With {{the onset}} of World War II, the Ministry of Supply in the United Kingdom {{established}} a BW program at Porton Down, headed by the microbiologist Paul Fildes. The research was championed by Winston Churchill and soon tularemia, anthrax, brucellosis, and botulism toxins had been effectively weaponized. In particular, Gruinard Island in Scotland, was contaminated with anthrax during a series of extensive tests for the next 56 years. Although the UK never offensively used the biological weapons it developed on its own, its program {{was the first to}} successfully weaponize a variety of deadly pathogens and bring them into industrial production. Other nations, notably France and Japan, had begun their own biological <b>weapons</b> <b>programs.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{nuclear reactors}} were built during World War II. These reactors {{were designed for}} the production of plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. The only reprocessing required, therefore, was the extraction of the plutonium (free of fission-product contamination) from the spent natural uranium fuel. In 1943, several methods were proposed for separating the relatively small quantity of plutonium from the uranium and fission products. The first method selected, a precipitation process called the bismuth phosphate process, was developed and tested at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) between 1943 and 1945 to produce quantities of plutonium for evaluation and use in the US <b>weapons</b> <b>programs.</b> ORNL produced the first macroscopic quantities (grams) of separated plutonium with these processes.|$|E
25|$|While Iraq's WMD {{capabilities}} were degraded under UN {{supervision and}} set back by Coalition strikes, some capabilities remain and others could quickly be regenerated. Despite claims that WMD efforts have ceased, Iraq probably is continuing clandestine nuclear research, retains stocks {{of chemical and}} biological munitions, and is concealing extended-range SCUD missiles, possibly equipped with CBW payloads. Even if Baghdad reversed its course and surrendered all WMD capabilities, it retains the scientific, technical, and industrial infrastructure to replace agents and munitions within weeks or months. A special concern {{is the absence of}} a UN inspection and monitoring presence, which until December 1998 had been paramount to preventing large-scale resumption of prohibited <b>weapons</b> <b>programs.</b> A new disarmament regime must be reintroduced into Iraq as soon as possible and allowed to carry out the mandates dictated by the post-Gulf War UN resolutions.|$|E

25|$|The IAEA has {{requested}} that third parties {{allow it to}} share the documents on the alleged studies with Iran. The IAEA has further stated that though it has not provided full documents containing the alleged studies, information from other countries has corroborated some of the allegations, which appear to the IAEA to be consistent and credible, and that Iran should therefore address the alleged studies even without obtaining the full documents. However, questions about {{the authenticity of the}} documents persist, with claims that the documents were obtained either from Israel or the MEK, an Iranian dissident group officially considered to be a terrorist organization by the United States, and that investigations into the alleged studies are intended to reveal intelligence about Iran's conventional <b>weapons</b> <b>programs.</b> Some IAEA officials have requested a clear statement be made by the agency that it could not affirm the documents' authenticity. They cite that as a key document in the study had since been proven to have been fraudulently altered, it put in doubt the entire collection.|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} {{speech on the}} Senate floor in March 1963, McGovern praised Kennedy's Alliance for Progress initiative, but spoke out against U.S.policy towards Cuba, saying that it {{suffered}} from [...] "our Castro fixation". In August 1963, McGovern advocated reducing the $53billion defense budget by $5 billion; influenced by advisor Seymour Melman, he held a special antipathy towards the doctrine of nuclear [...] "overkill". McGovern would try to reduce defense appropriations or limit military expenditures in almost every year during the 1960s. He also voted against many <b>weapons</b> <b>programs,</b> especially missile and anti-missile systems, and also opposed military assistance to foreign nations. In 1964 McGovern published his first book, War Against Want: America's Food for Peace Program. In it he argued for expanding his old program, and a Senate measure he introduced was eventually passed, adding $700million to the effort's funding.|$|E
