5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that <b>we</b> <b>return</b> to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E

25|$|He {{makes the}} analogy of the plot twist in The War of the Worlds, by H.G. Wells, where Earth {{pathogens}} made the Martian invaders of Earth sick and then die. Perhaps, he suggests, the same could happen to us on Earth if <b>we</b> <b>return</b> samples containing micro-organisms from Mars. On the one hand, he points out, this possibility seems unlikely {{because of the lack}} of contact between the two planets and because pathogens adapt to their host. On the other hand, the lack of contact also means that we would have never evolved any defences against any pathogens.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to neoclassical {{production}} theory, Georgescu identifies {{nature as}} the exclusive {{primary source of}} all factors of production. According to the first law of thermodynamics, matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in the economy (the conservation principle). According to the second law of thermodynamics — the entropy law — {{what happens in the}} economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes to states unavailable for human purposes (the degradation principle). This transformation constitutes a unidirectional and irreversible process. Consequently, valuable natural resources ('low entropy') are procured by the input end of the economy; the resources flow through the economy, being transformed and manufactured into goods along the way; and unvaluable waste and pollution ('high entropy') eventually accumulate by the output end. Mankind lives in, by and of nature, and <b>we</b> <b>return</b> our residues to nature. By so doing, the entropy of the combined nature-economy system steadily increases.|$|E

If we had hope to use them as keys, we {{discover}} they do not quite fit the lock. Meanwhile they have given us a standard hard to equal. Hence we either feel a disappointment about the 'Ode to Psyche' or else, remembering the care Keats supposedly gave it, we once more put the poem aside for future consideration." [...] However, he also states that [...] "The modern, respectful attitude toward this ode is deserved. But the itch for novelty has encouraged a few critics {{to suggest that the}} poem, in some dark but fundamental way, has more to it as a whole than do the later odes." ...|$|E

500|$|Though {{nominally}} {{an independent}} country, Egypt had been effectively under British control {{since the late}} nineteenth century. With the outbreak of war, and {{under the terms of}} the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, the country was under virtual occupation by the British. [...] At this stage in the war, the Germans were advancing apparently unstoppably across the desert towards Egypt, and Cairo was rife with rumours and alarms. Manning was jittery and fearful. She was constantly anxious about illness, and was indeed frequently unwell. Concerned, Reggie suggested that it might be best if she returned to England, but she retorted [...] "Wherever we go, we go together. If <b>we</b> <b>return</b> home, we both go. I won't have the war separating us. End of story." [...] Her father had made her a firm believer in the British Empire and the benefits it had brought the world, and Manning was a patriotic Briton, confident of ultimate Allied success. In Egypt, however, she confronted the fact that British occupation had never been popular. Reggie quickly discovered the Anglo-Egyptian Union in Zamalek, where he drank and talked politics and poetry. As usual he was well liked, and according to Lawrence Durrell often had a string of disreputable friends with him. Manning was much less popular. Durrell described her as a [...] "hook-nosed condor", whose critical manner was unappreciated by many who knew her.|$|E
500|$|... "Letters That Cross in the Mail" [...] was {{the first}} song {{recorded}} for the album. Streisand claimed that the inspiration behind the track was simple: it is [...] "about love and the postal service". Santopietro wrote that Holmes' love for of [...] "big band sound" [...] and [...] "a full symphonic orchestra" [...] {{is evident in the}} production. Following her cover of [...] "All in Love Is Fair" [...] in 1974, seventh track [...] "You and I" [...] is Streisand's second cover of a Stevie Wonder song. Taken from his 1972 studio album Talking Book, she called the pop song [...] "immediately [...] touch" [...] and considered Wonder [...] "brilliant" [...] for his work on it. Written by Howard Dietz and Ralph Rainger, Streisand's cover of Libby Holman's [...] "Moanin' Low" [...] appears as the eighth song. In order to place focus on the lyrics during the song, the production contains [...] "octave leaps" [...] while Streisand [...] "changes timbre frequently and quickly between loud and soft sections and high and low pitches". Ninth track [...] "A Child Is Born" [...] features a simplistic piano arrangement accompanied solely by Streisand's vocals; Columbia Records executive reacted to the track's new genre for the singer, stating, [...] "You could put Barbra in front of a rock band or a symphony orchestra, she would still be Barbra Streisand, not compromising, not uncomfortable". [...] "Widescreen", the album's closing track, was inspired by the singer's love of film; according to author Patrick E. Horrigan, it specifically explains [...] "how the movies, dark and dreamlike, seduce us into believing that life can be fulfilling, then let us down as soon as <b>we</b> <b>return</b> to the light of day". It was also the last of four tracks written by Holmes and has a production consisting of [...] "synthesized electronics".|$|E

2500|$|When Escrivá was 10 or 11 years old, {{he already}} had the habit of {{carrying}} the rosary in his pocket. As a priest, he would ordinarily end his homilies and his personal prayer with {{a conversation with the}} Blessed Virgin. He instructed that all rooms in the offices of Opus Dei should have an image of the Virgin. He encouraged his spiritual children to greet these images when they entered a room. He encouraged a Marian apostolate, preaching that [...] "To Jesus we go and to Him <b>we</b> <b>return</b> through Mary". While looking at a picture of the Virgin of Guadalupe giving a rose to San Juan Diego, he commented: [...] "I would like to die that way." [...] On 26 June 1975, after entering his work room, which had a painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe, he slumped on the floor and died.|$|E
2500|$|Guitarist Wacław [...] "Vogg" [...] Kiełtyka {{commented on}} the album, [...] "Extreme and groove — I think that's {{the best way to}} {{describe}} our new album. This time we feel that we have something totally crushing and huge. Blood Mantra is the most heavy and mature album we ever did in our career. I cannot wait to start to play songs live because riffs are soo deep and powerful." [...] He also stated, [...] "We flirt with various tempos mixing death metal with grindcore and almost outright black metal atmosphere together with more, so to speak, 'crowd-puller' beats verging on groovy, almost stoner-rock climates. There are also a few more modern metal rhythmic riffs where <b>we</b> <b>return</b> to the climate of Organic Hallucinosis album. I'm certain that the very fact we are again, after 9 years, in Hertz studio will evoke the spirit of that album. The vocals sound very promising. Rasta [...] is a much more experienced vocalist compared to the Carnival Is Forever album times. And his voice sounds more powerful and deeper." ...|$|E
