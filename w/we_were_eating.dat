60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating</b> hurriedly, lest {{we should}} be ordered {{to take up the}} picks and shovels before our hunger could be satisfied, when Darius came in looking {{thoroughly}} fagged and worn out.|$|E
60|$|It grew dark {{very quickly}} while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating,</b> {{and the wind}} that dipped down into the gorge was cold. I kept edging {{closer and closer to}} the blazing campfire. I had never tasted venison before, and rather disliked it at first. But I soon {{cultivated}} a liking for it.|$|E

60|$|While <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating,</b> the dervish {{happened}} {{to mention that}} in a spot only a little way off from where we were sitting, there was hidden a treasure so great that if my eighty camels were loaded till they could carry no more, the hiding place would seem as full {{as if it had}} never been touched.|$|E
6000|$|... "I remember, one time, {{a little}} caballard of Spanish men sauntered {{out from behind}} a patch of sugar-cane and shot Bob Turner, the first {{sergeant}} of our company, while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating</b> dinner. As required by the army regulations, we fellows went through the usual tactics of falling into line, saluting the enemy, and loading and firing, kneeling.|$|E
60|$|Just as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating</b> apple pie--how Ben Davises {{and tragedy}} impinge upon each other!--I noticed Sam looking with keen intentness at our quarry {{where they were}} {{seated at a table}} across the room. The girl still wore the brown dress with lace collar and cuffs, and the veil drawn down to her nose. The man bent over his plate, with his close cropped head held low.|$|E

At first I could not reconcile the facts with the Sand Lady's statement that no one lived on her island but her family, but now I see that this creek must make an island of her domain; and so it is that, although Captain Jabe is her neighbor, her statement is entirely correct." ...|$|E
60|$|All our rations, save {{what each}} man had held {{back in his}} pockets, were with the baggage-train, {{therefore}} we {{did not make a}} very hearty meal at noon, and perhaps it was as well, for while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating</b> the small amount of food at our disposal two companies of Maryland militia, under command of Major Peter, came into camp on the double quick, with every evidence of terror on their faces.|$|E
60|$|We {{remained}} with these soldiers four days, {{during which time}} even Hiram saw no fair opportunity to cross over into the town, and meanwhile <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating</b> our hearts out with impatience. As has already been said, too often, perhaps, I did not favor the plan, but yet before a suitable night came I was eager {{to be about the}} undertaking, for anything was better than remaining there twirling our thumbs, and it seemed certain that each day we lingered rendered it more difficult for us to come at Silas.|$|E

60|$|While <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating</b> I {{observed}} that armed Zulus arrived continually in parties of {{from six to}} a score of men, and as they arrived lifted their spears, though whether in salutation to Saduko or to myself I did not know, and sat themselves down on an open space {{between us and the}} river-bank. Although it was difficult to say whence they came, for they appeared like ghosts out of the bush, I thought it well to take no notice of them, since I guessed that their coming was prearranged.|$|E

Whilst <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating,</b> some Badawin came in and joined us, when invited so to do. They were poorly dressed, and all armed with knives and cheap sabres, hanging to leathern bandoleers: in language and demeanour they showed few remains of their old ferocity. As late as Mohammed Ali's time these people were noted wreckers, and formerly they were dreaded pirates: now they are lions with their fangs and claws drawn.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating</b> little jam [...] "{{turnovers}}," [...] which Felicity {{had made}} for us. Felicity's turnovers were perfection. I {{looked at her and}} wondered why it was not enough that she should be so pretty and capable of making such turnovers. If she were only more interesting! Felicity had not a particle of the nameless charm and allurement which hung about every motion of the Story Girl, and made itself manifest in her lightest word and most careless glance. Ah well, one cannot have every good gift! The Story Girl had no dimples at her slim, brown wrists.|$|E

60|$|That night, while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating</b> the venison with relish, {{since it}} was the first fresh meat that we had tasted for many a day, I {{observed}} that the disposition of our camp was different from its common form. Thus it was smaller and placed on an eminence. Also the camels were not allowed to graze where they would as usual, but were kept within a limited area while their riders were arranged in groups outside of them. Further, the stores were piled near our tents, in the centre, with guards set over them. I asked Harût and Marût, who were sharing our meal, the reason of these alterations.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating</b> {{bread and}} milk at the farm, {{and the father}} was talking with vague sadness and reminiscence, {{lingering}} over the thought of their departure from the old house. He was a pure romanticist, forever seeking the colour {{of the past in}} the present's monotony. He seemed settling down to an easy contented middle-age, when the unrest on the farm and development of his children quickened him with fresh activity. He read books on the land question, and modern novels. In the end he became an advanced radical, almost a socialist. Occasionally his letters appeared in the newspapers. He had taken a new hold on life.|$|E
60|$|What he said {{proved to}} be true, for a minute later down came the colonel with orders that we should pile arms and bivouac where we were; and there we stayed all day, while horse and foot and guns, English, Dutch, and Hanoverians, were {{streaming}} through. The devil's music went on till evening, sometimes rising into a roar, sometimes sinking into a grumble, until about eight o'clock in the evening it stopped altogether. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating</b> our hearts out, as you may think, {{to know what it}} all meant, but we knew that what the Duke did would be for the best, so we just waited in patience.|$|E

These London men are very sharp, and used to sizing and sorting {{all kinds of people}} as if they was potatoes being got ready for market, and they have seen that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not what they call over here gentlefolks." ...|$|R

[...] He borrowed his knife from the girl, who was slicing and buttering bread with it, and turned the bacon swiftly and deftly with the point, then {{he glanced at his}} watch. [...] "The three minutes are up," [...] he announced and, with a couple of small, flat sticks saved for the purpose from the kindling wood, withdrew the eggs one at a time from the can.|$|R
60|$|The {{intruder}} devoured the cutlets—if {{they were}} cutlets. Notwithstanding my perfect liberty of mind I {{was not aware}} of what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating.</b> I have a notion that the lunch was a mere show, except of course for the man with the white hair, who was really hungry and who, besides, must have had the pleasant sense of dominating the situation. He stooped over his plate and worked his jaw deliberately while his blue eyes rolled incessantly; but {{as a matter of fact}} he never looked openly at any one of us. Whenever he laid down his knife and fork he would throw himself back and start retailing in a light tone some Parisian gossip about prominent people.|$|E
60|$|We made {{signs to}} them, by putting our fingers to our mouths, and moving our chaps as if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating,</b> {{that we wanted}} provisions; and we hung up a white flag for a truce. They {{presently}} understood the first signal, but knew nothing of the last; and as to provisions, just as had been the case before, they brought us out roots and fruits, such as they ate themselves, but such as we had never seen before. Some of them, however, were very sweet and good, and when we boiled them they tasted much like an English parsnip; and we gave them strings of beads, pieces of glass, and such things as we remarked they were fond of.|$|E
6000|$|Our train drew up at {{the humble}} door of the Capo-gente (in Fozza all doors are alike humble), and, leaving our mules, we entered by his wife's invitation, and seated {{ourselves}} near the welcome fire of the kitchen--welcome, though we knew that all the sunny Lombard plain below was purple with grapes and black with figs. Again came from the women here the wail of the shepherds: [...] "Ah, lords! {{is it not a}} miserable land?" [...] and I began to doubt whether the love which I had heard mountaineers bore to their inclement heights was not altogether fabulous. They made haste to boil us some eggs, and set them before us with some unhappy wine, and while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>eating,</b> the Capo-gente came in.|$|E
