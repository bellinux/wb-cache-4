5|$|In 1872, {{architect}} Elijah E. Myers of Springfield, Illinois, {{was commissioned}} {{to design the}} new capitol building and the design committee selected his design named Tuebor, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>I</b> will defend. Myers used the central dome and wing design found in the United States Capitol in his design and subsequently went on to design two other state capitol buildings, the statehouses of Colorado and Texas, {{as well as the}} former territorial capitol building of Idaho, the most by any architect. The cornerstone was laid on October 2, 1873, with about 7,000 Lansing residents and some 30,000 to 50,000 visitors attending. Construction and finishing work were completed by late 1878. The new capitol, with 139 rooms, was dedicated {{at the same time as}} the inauguration of Governor Charles Croswell January 1, 1879.|$|E

She said: [...] "I’m not prepared to be 70 and absolutely broke. I realised last year that I have no safety net at all and I’m {{going to have to}} get one. So I need to change my attitude to life, <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>I</b> have to put away 10 per cent every year of my old age. I want to be in a position where I don’t have to work. I should have thought about this a long time ago but I didn’t." [...] However, she still lived in her flat in Paris (located in one of the most expensive streets of the capital) and had a house in County Waterford, Ireland. Recording of Easy Come, Easy Go commenced in New York City on 6 December 2007; the album was produced by Hal Willner who had previously recorded Strange Weather in 1997. A version of Morrissey's [...] "Dear God Please Help Me" [...] from his 2006 album, Ringleader of the Tormentors is one of the songs featured. In March 2009, she performed [...] "The Crane Wife 3" [...] on The Late Show.

60|$|While {{thus the}} enterprising Peter was coasting, with flowing sail, up {{the shores of}} the lordly Hudson, and arousing all the phlegmatic little Dutch {{settlements}} upon its borders, a great and puissant concourse of warriors was assembling at the city of New Amsterdam.

6000|$|At {{last the}} east grew faintly grey, and we started, not keeping together, but Bludger marching {{cautiously}} in my rear, at a considerable distance. We only met one person, a dissipated young man, who, I greatly fear, had been paying his court to a shepherdess in the hills. When he shouted a challenge, I replied, Erastes eimi, <b>which</b> <b>means,</b> <b>I</b> {{am sorry to}} say, [...] "I am a lover," [...] and implied that I, also, had been engaged in low intrigue. [...] "Farewell, with good fortune," [...] he replied, and went on his way, singing some catch about Amaryllis, who, I presume, was {{the object of his}} unhallowed attentions.|$|E

I took you for my own pleasure, and it doesn't make much {{difference}} to have you in the house, and if it did I shouldn't care. But you must look after yourself for the present, as I have just got rid of one servant and there are only two to do everything. They are anxious for me not to engage a third just now, and prefer to do all the work themselves, <b>which</b> <b>means,</b> <b>I</b> suppose, that there will be more plunder to divide between them." ...|$|E

60|$|Returning to my forest hut, I {{continued}} {{my daily}} search after birds and insects. The weather, however, became dreadfully hot and dry, {{every drop of}} water disappearing from the pools and rock-holes, {{and with it the}} insects which frequented them. Only one group remained unaffected by the intense drought; the Diptera, or two-winged flies, continued as plentifully as ever, and on these I was almost compelled to concentrate my attention for a week or two, by <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>I</b> increased my collection of that Order to about two hundred species. I also continued to obtain a few new birds, among which were two or three kinds of small hawks and falcons, a beautiful brush-tongued paroquet, Trichoglossus ornatus, and a rare black and white crow, Corvus advena.|$|E

6000|$|My way for {{measuring}} {{how much a}} Glass magnifies an Object, plac'd at a [...] convenient distance from my eye, is this.

60|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. Well, I really hadnt {{time to be}} a father: {{thats the}} plain truth of the matter. Their poor dear mother did the usual thing while they were with us. Then of course, Harrow, Cambridge, the usual routine of their class. I saw very little of them, and thought very little about them: how could I? with a whole {{province}} on my hands. They and I are--acquaintances. Not perhaps, quite ordinary acquaintances: theres a sort of--er--I should almost call it a sort of remorse about the way we shake hands (when we do shake hands) <b>which</b> <b>means,</b> <b>I</b> suppose, that we're sorry we dont care more for one another; and I'm afraid we dont meet oftener than we can help. We put each other too much out of countenance. It's really a very difficult relation. To my mind not altogether a natural one.|$|E

60|$|I have premised this introduction, {{compounded}} of {{the merry}} and the serious, with {{the hopes of}} engaging many curious people of all sorts to be my readers, even from the airy nice peruser of novels and romances, neatly bound and finely gilt, to the grave philosopher, that is daily thumbing over the musty and tattered pieces of more solid antiquity. I have all the wonders to tell that such a merry kind of a prophet has told, to entertain the fancies of the first gay tribe, by <b>which</b> <b>means</b> <b>I</b> may entice them into some solid knowledge and judgment of human nature; and I have several solid disquisitions of learning to make, accounting for the manner of these mysterious operations, never touched upon before in due form and order by {{the hands of the}} ancient or modern sages, that I may bribe the judgment of this last grave class, so far as to endure the intermixing entertainment with their severer studies.|$|E
60|$|When {{the poor}} man at Oxford loses his angles (<b>which</b> <b>means,</b> <b>I</b> suppose, his independence), he may perhaps, even if his poverty is of that highly {{relative}} type possible at Oxford, gain {{a certain amount of}} worldly advantage from the surrender of those angles. I must confess, however, that I can imagine nothing nastier than to lose one's angles. It seems to me that a desire to retain some angles about one's person is a desire common to all those human beings who do not set their ultimate hopes upon looking like Humpty-Dumpty. Our angles are simply our shapes. I cannot imagine any phrase more full of the subtle and exquisite vileness which is poisoning and weakening our country than such a phrase as this, about the desirability of rubbing down the angularities of poor men. Reduced to permanent and practical human speech, it means nothing whatever except the corrupting of that first human sense of justice which is the critic of all human institutions.|$|E
6000|$|The Feminist (<b>which</b> <b>means,</b> <b>I</b> think, one who dislikes {{the chief}} {{feminine}} characteristics) has heard my loose monologue, bursting {{all the time}} with one pent-up protest. At this point he will break out and say, [...] "But what are we to do? There is modern commerce and its clerks; there is the modern family with its unmarried daughters; specialism is expected everywhere; female thrift and conscientiousness are demanded and supplied. What does it matter whether we should in the abstract prefer the old human and housekeeping woman; we might prefer the Garden of Eden. But since women have trades they ought to have trades unions. Since women work in factories, they ought to vote on factory-acts. If they are unmarried they must be commercial; if they are commercial they must be political. We must have new rules for a new world--even if it be not a better one." [...] I said to a Feminist once: [...] "The question is not whether women are good enough for votes: it is whether votes are good enough for women."
