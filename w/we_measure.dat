25|$|Moreover, in {{contrast}} to classical mechanics, it is unavoidable that performing a measurement on the system generally changes its state. More precisely: After measuring an observable A, the system will be in an eigenstate of A; thus the state has changed, unless the system was already in that eigenstate. This expresses a kind of logical consistency: If <b>we</b> <b>measure</b> A twice in the same run of the experiment, the measurements being directly consecutive in time, then they will produce the same results. This has some strange consequences, however, as follows.|$|E

Now, if <b>we</b> <b>measure</b> a particular characteristic of one of these particles (say, for example, spin), get a result, and then measure the other particle using the same criterion (spin along the same axis), we find that the result of the measurement of the second particle will match (in a complementary sense) the result of the measurement of the first particle, in that they will be opposite in their values.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principle}} of relativity {{implies that the}} outcome of local experiments must be independent of the velocity of the apparatus, so the most important consequence of this principle is the Copernican idea that dimensionless physical values such as the fine-structure constant and electron-to-proton mass ratio must not depend on where in space or time <b>we</b> <b>measure</b> them.

2500|$|For example, {{consider}} a free particle. In quantum mechanics, a free matter {{is described by}} a wave function. [...] The particle properties of the matter become apparent when <b>we</b> <b>measure</b> its position and velocity. [...] The wave properties of the matter become apparent when <b>we</b> <b>measure</b> its wave properties like interference. [...] The wave–particle duality feature is incorporated in the relations of coordinates and operators {{in the formulation of}} quantum mechanics. [...] Since the matter is free (not subject to any interactions), its quantum state can be represented as a wave of arbitrary shape and extending over space as a wave function. The position and momentum of the particle are observables. The Uncertainty Principle states that both the position and the momentum cannot simultaneously be measured with complete precision. However, one can measure the position (alone) of a moving free particle, creating an eigenstate of position with a wave function that is very large (a Dirac delta) at a particular position x, and zero everywhere else. If one performs a position measurement on such a wave function, the resultant x will be obtained with 100% probability (i.e., with full certainty, or complete precision). This is called an eigenstate of position—or, stated in mathematical terms, a generalized position eigenstate (eigendistribution). If the particle is in an eigenstate of position, then its momentum is completely unknown. On the other hand, if the particle is in an eigenstate of momentum, then its position is completely unknown.|$|E
