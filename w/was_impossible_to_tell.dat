5|$|Because {{the storm}} had blown down {{telegraph}} lines in the area, two riders immediately set off for Roberts, ten miles to the south, and sent messages into St. Paul with news of the tornado. Altogether, the tornado and the subsequent fires that raged throughout the following night destroyed the entire business district along {{with more than half}} the residences in town, which combined added up to more than 300 buildings. The only significant surviving structures were the Lumber and Roller Mills located {{on the banks of the}} Willow River, the latter of which was narrowly missed by the tornado, the town's public school and the Catholic Church, which acted as either makeshift shelters or morgues. Only the extreme northwestern and southeastern portions of the city were spared. The town's electrical plant and water facilities were destroyed, so fires ran rampant through the scattered debris. Many bodies found in the aftermath were burnt beyond recognition— it <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> if they died from the tornado or from being trapped and burned alive.|$|E

Goods such as brandy, perfume, lace and wine. Even goods such as salt were smuggled, as it <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the origin of that commodity, landing salt in England and claiming its manufacture in the Islands and tax free as against French salt, which was taxed. France also had a tax until 1790, the gabelle of 140 times the cost of production, so producers wanted to export. In 1795 England arrested 10,000 people for salt smuggling.|$|E

25|$|Early in the 20th century polio {{would become}} the world's most feared disease. The disease hit without warning, tended to strike white, {{affluent}} individuals, required long quarantine periods during which parents were separated from children: it <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> who would get the disease and who would be spared. The consequences of the disease left polio victims marked for life, leaving behind vivid images of wheelchairs, crutches, leg braces, breathing devices, and deformed limbs. However, polio changed not only {{the lives of those}} who survived it, but also affected profound cultural changes: the emergence of grassroots fund-raising campaigns that would revolutionize medical philanthropy, the rise of rehabilitation therapy and, through campaigns for the social and civil rights of the disabled, polio survivors helped to spur the modern disability rights movement.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{have claimed}} that, without avian air sacs, modest {{improvements}} {{in a few}} aspects of a modern reptile's circulatory and respiratory systems would enable the reptile to achieve 50% to 70% of the oxygen flow of a mammal of similar size, and that lack of avian air sacs would not prevent the development of endothermy.

25|$|According to Efraim Karsh, {{before the}} {{fighting}} started, the IDF used loudspeakers broadcasting in Arabic {{to urge the}} locals to evacuate the camp, and he estimates that some 11,000 left. Stephanie Gutmann {{also noted that the}} IDF used bullhorns and announcements in Arabic to inform the residents of the invasion, and that the troops massed outside the camp for a day because of rain. She estimated that 1,200 remained in the camp, but that it <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> how many of them were fighters. After the battle, Israeli intelligence estimated that half the population of noncombatants had left before the invasion, and 90% had done so by the third day, leaving around 1,300 people. Others estimated that 4,000 people had remained in the camp. Some camp residents reported hearing the Israeli calls to evacuate, while others said they did not. Many thousands did leave the camp, with women and children usually permitted to move into the villages in the surrounding hills or the neighbouring city. However, the men who left were almost all temporarily detained. Instructed by Israeli soldiers to strip before they were taken away, journalists who entered Jenin following the invasion remarked that heaps of discarded clothing in the ruined streets showed where they were taken into custody.|$|E

With the exception of their persuasive No 1 single, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful", their songs aren't wildly distinctive". For the concert at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo in London, James Robertson (Daily Mirror) gave the band a positive review. He states, [...] "The room shook with hair raising, ear drum piercing and (if there had been windows) glass-shattering screams.

Dreams came true for thousands of Irish female fans as their pop idols One Direction took to the stage at the O2.

2500|$|On 16 October 1888 {{a parcel}} {{containing}} half a human kidney {{accompanied by a}} note was received by George Lusk, Chairman of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee. The note {{has become known as}} the [...] "Lusk letter" [...] or the [...] "From hell" [...] letter, because of a phrase [...] "from hell" [...] used by the writer, who claimed to have [...] "fried and ate" [...] the missing kidney half. The handwriting and style were unlike that of the [...] "Saucy Jacky" [...] postcard. The kidney was taken to Dr Thomas Horrocks Openshaw at the nearby London Hospital. He believed that the kidney was human, from the left side, and preserved in spirit. The Daily Telegraph reported on 19 October that {{he said it was a}} recent [...] "ginny kidney" [...] from a 45-year-old female, but in the Star newspaper the same day Openshaw denied the report strongly, saying it <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> its age or gender, or how long it had been preserved in spirits. Major Smith claimed in his memoirs that the sent kidney matched the one missing from Eddowes, because the length of renal artery attached to the kidney matched the missing length from the body, and both the body and kidney showed signs of Bright's disease. Smith's later recollection does not match the medical reports submitted by the examining pathologists or the police records. Police surgeon Dr Brown said that the kidney had been trimmed up, and that the renal artery was entirely absent. Metropolitan police memos state that the kidney could have come from any body, such as those found in a hospital morgue. Smith's story is thought by historians to be dramatic licence on his part, and the kidney could have been a medical student's prank. Dr Saunders, who attended the post-mortem, told the press, [...] "the right kidney of the woman Eddowes was perfectly normal in its structure and healthy... my opinion is that it was a student's antic." [...] Chief Inspector Donald Swanson, who co-ordinated the inquiry, wrote, [...] "similar kidneys might and could be obtained from any dead person upon whom a post mortem had been made for any cause, by students or dissecting room porter." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{spring of}} 1944 is remembered in France as {{time of the}} mentalité terrible, the period of la guerre franco-française when the Milice and the Maquis fought one another without mercy. The Milice and maquis were caught up in ever-escalating cycle of {{violence}} with Ousby commenting: [...] "1944 had simply become the time for settling scores, any scores, for revenging grudges, any grudges. Agreed on this common imperative, the sides in the conflict blur and become almost indistinguishable from each other. The Milice hit squads pretended to be the Maquis; the Maquis hit squads pretended to be the Milice. Sometimes it <b>was</b> <b>impossible</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> which was really which, and sometimes it hardly mattered". As {{it was starting to}} become more and more clear that the Allies were going to win the war, the Milice become more desperate and vicious as the knowledge that when the Allies won, the miliciens would be tried for treason if they not killed out of hand first, caused the Milice to engage in increasing savage torture and killings of the maquisards, hoping against hope that they could annihilate all of their enemies before the Allies won. For their part, some of the maquisards struck back in kind against the Milice. In the town of Voiron, close to Grenoble, in April 1944, a Maquis assassination squad entered the home of the local Milice chief and killed him, his wife, his infant daughter, his 10-year-old son, and his 82-year-old mother. Outside the village of Saint-Laurent in the Haute-Savoie, a mass grave was discovered in May 1944 of eight gendarmes known for their loyalty to Vichy kidnapped by the Maquis from Bonneville who had been lined up and shot by their captors. The killing of the gendarmes was denounced by the chief collaboratorist propagandist Philippe Henriot on the radio as the [...] "French Katyn", who used the killings {{as an example of the}} sort of [...] "Bolshevik terrorism" [...] that he maintained was typical of the resistance. In the south of France, the Maquis had started to form an alternative government to Vichy, which still controlled the French civil service. Georges Guingouin, the Communist maquis leader of the Maquis du Limousin in the Limousin region styled himself a préfet and imposed his own system of rationing on the local farmers that flouted the rationing system imposed by Vichy. In the Auxois region, the Maquis Bernard had created its system of taxation with people being taxed on the basis of their willingness to collaborate with the authorities or support the resistance. When the British philosopher A. J. Ayer arrived in Gascony as a SOE agent in the spring of 1944, he described a power structure established by the maquis that placed power [...] "in the hands of a series of feudal lords whose power and influence were strangely similar to that of their fifteenth-century Gason counterparts".|$|E
