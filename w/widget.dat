50|$|<b>Widgets</b> come in many {{shapes and}} sizes, {{but two of}} the major types today are Web <b>widgets</b> and Desktop <b>widgets.</b> Web <b>widgets</b> are {{intended}} for use on (embedding in) webpages and have major implications in areas such as site performance, SEO and even backlink campaigns. Desktop <b>widgets</b> are embedded on local computers, and do not impact SEO or webpage performance.|$|R
40|$|<b>Widgets</b> {{are small}} and focused {{multimedia}} applications {{that can be found}} on desktop computers, mobile devices or even TV sets. <b>Widgets</b> rely on structured documents to describe their spatial, temporal and interactive behavior but also to communicate with remote data sources. However, these sources have to be known at authoring time and the communication process relies heavily on scripting. In this paper, we describe a mechanism enabling the communication between <b>widgets</b> and their dynamic environment (other <b>widgets,</b> remote data sources). The proposed declarative mechanism is compatible with existing <b>Widgets</b> technologies, usable with script-based <b>widgets</b> as well as with fully declarative <b>widgets.</b> A description of an implementation is also provided...|$|R

5|$|The duo enlisted a music {{marketing}} startup company—TopspinMedia—to {{design their}} site, delivery {{options for the}} digitalmusic, and promotional webwidgets. Like {{the entirety of the}} recording process, the marketing was self-financed and controlled by the artists, with Topspin taking a portion of the money made from digital sales. This allowed the artists to control creative aspects of producing music as well as the overhead costs associated with marketing an album. The company used viralmarketing techniques to collect potential customers' e-mailaddresses and encourage them to post the album streaming on their blogs. By early November, the collected e-mail addresses amounted to 37percent of the album sales. Topspin has also created a Flickr pool encouraging users to upload screenshots of the <b>widget</b> posted to web sites. No advertisements were taken out for the album.|$|E

By using the tracking state movements, Hover <b>Widgets</b> create a new command layer which is clearly distinct from the input layer of a pen interface.
