Often it betrays him into employing the RULES FOR CONVERSATION BETWEEN A SHOUTER AND A DEAF PERSON--as in the present case--when he ought to employ the RULES FOR CONDUCTING DISCUSSION WITH A FAULT-FINDER. The great foundation-rule and basic principle of discussion with a fault-finder is relevancy and concentration upon the subject; whereas the great foundation-rule and basic principle governing conversation between a shouter and a deaf person is irrelevancy and persistent desertion of the topic in hand.

The warning had its effect, until one day when the professor was called {{for a few minutes}} from the room. An undergraduate, to whom the natural sciences, unrelieved, were a monotonous study, slipped into the ante-room, from which he emerged with the professor's hat. This he placed on the desk, and then stole in a panic to his seat. An awe fell upon the class. The professor returned, but when he saw the hat he stopped. He showed no anger.

[...] Just so, I believe, when the sea seems to ebb away during the earthquake, the land is really being raised out of the sea, hundreds of miles of coast, perhaps, or a whole island, at once, by the force of the steam and gas imprisoned under the ground. That steam stretches and strains the solid rocks below, till they can bear no more, and snap, and crack, with frightful roar and clang; then out of holes and chasms in the ground rush steam, gases--often foul and poisonous ones--hot water, mud, flame, strange stones--all signs that the great boiler down below has burst at last.|$|E

Three of the greatest industrial undertakings which the world has ever known, in which are invested hundreds of millions of honest American capital, are still controlled by us.

40|$|Do unto {{others as}} you would have them do unto you ” (e. g., Matthew 7 : 12). The golden rule of most {{religions}} assumes that the cognitive abilities of perspective-taking and empathy are the basis of morality. According to Goldman (1995), you simulate what <b>you</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were in the situation of another and act accordingly. One would therefore predict that people that display difficulties in those abilities, such as people with psychopathy and autism, are impaired in morality. This seems to be confirmed by studies on psychopaths, who show deficits both in empathy and morality (Blair, Mitchell and Blair, 2005). However, Kennett (2002) and McGeer (this volume) suggest that in autism, the deficit of empathy {{does not lead to}} a deficit of morality. McGeer attempts to solve this paradox by investigating the “roots of moral agency”. She distinguishes a Kantian rational view of morality and a Humean emotional view of morality. She concludes that even if reason {{plays a key role in}} morality, this role is merely instrumental. Only emotions can constitute the motivation for moral behaviors. However, according to her, one should not reduce emotional motivation for morality solely to empathy. Other kinds of emotions may also play a role, emotions that would b...|$|R
6000|$|A dead calm {{descended on}} me. I was adrift in the Sargasso Sea--in the Doldrums, and had dropped my sextant overboard.

[...] "If father hadn't died," [...] I answered myself, [...] "you don't know what <b>would</b> have <b>happened.</b> And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> think that, because I am happy now, anything could make me not wish him back, it's a lie."

[...] Such a withered old face was {{the face of the}} pointsman at No. 11 point! The information suggested a host of questions, and the answers were these: [...] "You won't be able to understand till you've been down into a mine. We work our men in two ways: some by direct payment--under our own hand, and some by contractors. The contractor undertakes to deliver us the coal, supplying his own men, tools, and props. He's responsible for the safety of his men, and of course the Company knows and sees his work. Just fancy, among these five thousand people, what sort of effect the news of an accident would produce! It would go all through the Sonthal Parganas. We have any amount of Sonthals besides Mahometans and Hindus of every possible caste, down to those Musahers who eat pig. They don't require much administering in the civilian sense of the word. On Sundays, as a rule, if any man has had his daughter eloped with, or anything of that kind, he generally comes up to the manager's bungalow to get the matter put straight. If a man is disabled through accident he knows that as long as he's in the hospital he gets full wages, and the Company pays for the food of any of his women-folk who come to look after him. One, of course; not the whole clan. That makes our service popular with the people. Don't you believe that a native is a fool. You can train him to everything except responsibility. There's a rule in the workings that if there is any dangerous work--we haven't choke-damp; I will show you when we get down--no gang must work without an Englishman to look after them. A native wouldn't be wise enough to understand what the danger was, or where it came in. Even if he did, he'd shirk the responsibility. We can't afford to risk a single life. All our output is just as much as the Company want--about a thousand tons per working day. Three hundred thousand in the year. We could turn out more? Yes--a little. Well, yes, twice as much. I won't go on, because you wouldn't believe me. There's the coal under us, and we work it at any depth from following up an outcrop down to six hundred feet. That is our deepest shaft. We have no necessity to go deeper. At home the mines are sometimes fifteen hundred feet down. Well, the thickness of this coal here varies from anything you please to anything you please. There's enough of it to last your time and one or two hundred years longer. Perhaps even longer than that. Look at that stuff. That's big coal from the pit." ...|$|E

Shortly after that book was published {{he told me that he}} felt some important topics had not been included and that another book was needed.
