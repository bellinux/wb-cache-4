In the footage, her stylist said that the {{inspiration}} for the video was [...] "trailer-trash, ghetto fabulous, out-there, [...] edgy." [...] During the footage Beyoncé said [...] "I like this video. It's no choreography, no pressure. All I have to do is party and have a good time." [...] She also revealed that the video is supposed to reflect her simplistic childhood, adding: [...] "Growing up, I had really amazing parents and I had a great childhood. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>from</b> nicer homes to being in apartments with our lights cutting off. It didn't matter where we were 'cause we had love and we had so much fun. It's great when you don't have as much how you improvise and you have more fun." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in August 2005, Key explained that the album was a [...] "definite departure" [...] and [...] "more political" [...] than what Ocean Avenue had contained. In discussion of the album, Key said that the band had matured and that the music in Lights and Sounds would be different from their previous album. Though, Key added, [...] "...we have to be careful, {{we have to try}} and write songs [...] we wrote before. We have to make a conscious effort {{not to think about the}} fact that <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>from</b> being a nothing band... to having a bunch of hit singles in like, one year." [...] Printz Board of The Black Eyed Peas collaborated with Yellowcard on the song [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty" [...] where he played a trumpet solo. The song, [...] "How I Go", features a duet with Dixie Chicks' lead vocalist Natalie Maines, and features a twenty-five piece orchestra, which was conducted by violinist Sean Mackin. According to Peter Mosely, the band liked the Dixie Chicks' and even thought of collaborating with Maines on Ocean Avenue for the song [...] "View from Heaven". Mosely also revealed that the band approached Maines about singing on [...] "How I Go"; [...] "The original plan was just for her to sing back-up (on the song). [...] it ended up turning into a duet." [...] He also added that Maines took a demo of the song and returned to the studio, Sunset Sound, where the band were working, in addition to the Dixie Chicks working on their album, with lyrics and vocals of her own.|$|E

2500|$|Major Brent Beardsley, {{assistant}} to Dallaire, gave testimony at the ICTR. When {{asked about the}} sexual violence he had witnessed, he stated that the killing blows tended to be aimed at the reproductive organs, and that the victims had been deliberately slashed on the breasts and vagina. Beardsley also testified to having seen the bodies of girls as young as six and seven who had been raped so brutally that their vaginas were split and swollen from what had obviously been gang rapes. He concluded by saying [...] "Massacres kill the body. Rape kills the soul. And {{there was a lot}} of rape.

60|$|I {{took them}} gratefully, and as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>from</b> one island to another I laid in stores of cloves, cinnamon, and other spices. In one place I saw a {{tortoise}} which was twenty cubits long {{and as many}} broad, also a fish {{that was like a}} cow and had skin so thick that it was used to make shields. Another I saw that was like a camel in shape and colour. So by degrees we came back to Balsora, and I returned to Bagdad with so much money that I could not myself count it, besides treasures without end. I gave largely to the poor, and bought much land to add to what I already possessed, and thus ended my third voyage.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} the dense bush, and knowing {{something}} of the habits of wounded buffaloes, reflected {{that it would be}} a nasty job. Still I said nothing, because if I hesitated, I knew he would want to go alone. So we started. Evidently the beast had been badly hit, for the blood spoor was easy to follow. Yet it had been able to retreat up to the end of the kloof that terminated in a cliff over which trickled a stream of water. Here it was not more than a hundred paces wide, and on either side of it were other precipitous cliffs. As <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>from</b> one of these a war-horn, such as the Basutos use, was blown. Although I heard it, oddly enough, I paid no attention to it at the time, being utterly intent upon the business in hand.|$|E
60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>from</b> that hateful kloof which I {{have never}} seen since and hope I shall never see again, two of Zikali's men escorting us until we got into touch with white people. To these we said as little as possible. I think they {{believed}} that we were only premature tourists who had made a dash into Zululand to visit some of the battlefields. Indeed none of us ever reported our strange adventures, and after my experience with Kaatje we were particularly careful to say nothing in the hearing of any gentleman connected with the Press. But {{as a matter of}} fact there were so many people moving about and such a continual coming and going of soldiers and their belongings, that after we had managed to buy some decent clothes, which we did at the little town of Newcastle, nobody paid any attention to us.|$|E

The country cried shame, the King's troops grumbled, the sepoys openly murmured that their Gujputi was only a lieutenant, when he had performed such signal services. What was to be done? Lord Wellesley was in an evident quandary. 'Gahagan,' wrote he, 'to be a subaltern is evidently not your fate- -YOU WERE BORN FOR COMMAND; but Lake and General Wellesley are good officers, they cannot be turned out--I must make a post for you.

And your duty to your mother, nephew,--your duty to the Fifth Commandment, would have warranted your breaking with Miss L., and fulfilling your excellent mother's intentions regarding Miss--What was the Countess's Dutch name? Never mind. A name is nothing; but a plumb, Master George, is something to look at! Why, I have my dear little Miley at a dancing-school with Miss Barwell, Nabob Barwell's daughter, and I don't disguise my wish that the children may contract an attachment which may endure through their lives! I tell the Nabob so. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>from</b> the House of Commons one dancing-day and saw them. 'Twas beautiful to see the young things walking a minuet together!

60|$|It is proper, they say, to be {{disappointed}} on entering the town, {{or any of the}} various quarters of it, because the houses are not so magnificent on inspection and seen singly as they are when beheld en masse from the waters. But why form expectations so lofty? If you see a group of peasants picturesquely disposed at a fair, you don't suppose that they are all faultless beauties, or that the men's coats have no rags, and the women's gowns are made of silk and velvet: the wild ugliness of the interior of Constantinople or Pera has a charm of its own, greatly more amusing than rows of red bricks or drab stones, however symmetrical. With brick or stone they could never form those fantastic ornaments, railings, balconies, roofs, galleries, which jut {{in and out of the}} rugged houses of the city. As <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>from</b> Galata to Pera up a steep hill, which newcomers ascend with some difficulty, but which a porter, with a couple of hundredweight on his back, paces up without turning a hair, I thought the wooden houses far from being disagreeable objects, sights quite as surprising and striking as the grand one we had just left.|$|E
