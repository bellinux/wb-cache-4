In this view, his companions and followers took <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> approved of as a model (sunnah) and transmitted this information to the succeeding generations in the form of hadith. These reports led first to informal discussion and then systematic legal thought, articulated with greatest success in the eighth and ninth centuries by the master jurists Abu Hanifah, Malik ibn Anas, Al-Shafi‘i, and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, who are viewed as the founders of the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafiʿi, and Hanbali legal schools (madhhabs) of Sunni jurisprudence.|$|E

25|$|On 5 September 2006, Huntley {{was found}} {{unconscious}} in his prison cell and {{thought to have}} taken an overdose. He had previously taken an overdose of antidepressants in prison in June 2003 while awaiting his trial. He was under police guard in hospital for two days, before being returned to Wakefield prison, prompting much reaction from many present at the scene, as well as making {{the front pages of}} many of the UK newspapers the next morning. Following this attempted suicide, his cell was cleared and a tape was found which was marked with Queen on one side and Meat Loaf on the other. This tape is thought to contain confessions from Huntley on <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>and</b> how he did it. It is believed that Huntley made the tape in return for antidepressants from a fellow prisoner, who hoped to obtain and later sell the confession to the media after his release. On 28 March 2007, The Sun began publishing transcripts of Huntley's taped confession.|$|E

When Jimmy is shot {{at the end of the}} episode trying to save his family from demons, Castiel returns, taking Jimmy's daughter as his new vessel.

[...] Benioff continued, [...] "Every kid that grows up in Westeros, they all hear about this legendary sword fight that took place twenty years ago, and as far as Bran knew, it was just his father beat this legendary guy." [...] Weiss also stated [...] "Honor was so important to Ned Stark that it was worth losing his own life for, but he was completely ready to let go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important. It could make a very, very strong defense for Ned doing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> it certainly does puncture the mythology of Ned Stark that's running through this world, especially after his death." ...|$|E

[...] Rights to the title were transferred to a new company, Galaxy Magazine, Inc., owned by Vincent McCaffrey, proprietor of Avenue Victor Hugo, a second-hand book store in Boston; UPD retained a ten percent interest in order to receive income from future sales to pay off their debts. [...] Stine had compiled two more issues, but neither ever appeared; McCaffrey, who had also launched a separate magazine, Galileo, had cash-flow problems that prevented him from distributing the magazine as he had planned. [...] One more issue did finally appear from McCaffrey, in July 1980, in a large format; it was edited by Floyd Kemske.
