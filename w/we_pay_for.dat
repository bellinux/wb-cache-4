[...] In 1914, it {{acquired}} a Linotype, the first between Hastings, Nebraska and Denver, Colorado; McCook became the smallest city in Nebraska to possess one. [...] In 1924, the paper {{changed its name to}} the present McCook Daily Gazette and began daily publication; again, McCook became the smallest city in Nebraska with a daily newspaper. [...] In 1926, the operation moved to a new building on Main Street, its facade inscribed with the paper's motto: [...] "Service is the rent <b>we</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the space we occupy in this world." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 13, the {{campaign}} released a [...] called [...] "Tough on Terror" [...] {{in which a}} hypothetical terrorist attack occurs in a shopping mall. The ad blames inept border security for the attack and flashes images of an injured child and a wrecked train. After Tancredo gives his approval for the message with the comment [...] "I approve this message because someone needs to say it," [...] a voiceover states, [...] "There are consequences to open borders beyond the 20 million aliens {{who have come to}} take our jobs... the price <b>we</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> spineless politicians who refuse to defend our borders against those who come to kill." [...] Since its release, the ad received criticism from some who called it [...] "cheap" [...] and [...] "blatant fearmongering." [...] Bowdoin College political scientist Michael Franz likened the advertisement to the Daisy ad run by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 Presidential election claiming that the election of Barry Goldwater would lead to a nuclear war. The other Republican candidates in the race did not comment on the ad.|$|E
5000|$|In 2000, both Richards and Lee Latchford-Evans were criticised by the Anti Fascist Action {{organisation}} {{for making}} allegedly xenophobic remarks against asylum seekers. Latchford-Evans said [...] "there {{should be more}} jobs for English people". Richards said, [...] "Why are <b>we</b> <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> all these people {{to come into the}} country anyway?" [...] All accusations were denied by both Latchford-Evans and Richards.|$|R

So, if his lordship intends making of alterations, he'd better to have spoken to us first." ...|$|R

2500|$|Aristotle {{stated that}} [...] "the {{citizens}} must not live a mechanic or a mercantile life (for such a life is ignoble and inimical to virtue), nor yet must {{those who are}} to be citizens in the best state be tillers of the soil (for leisure is needed both {{for the development of}} virtue and for active participation in politics)", often paraphrased as [...] "all paid jobs absorb and degrade the mind." [...] Cicero wrote in 44 BC that [...] "vulgar are the means of livelihood of all hired workmen whom <b>we</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> mere manual labour, not for artistic skill; for in their case the very wage they receive is a pledge of their slavery." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brown was {{introduced}} to Harold Prince through his association with Daisy Prince, and was hired to write songs for the Broadway musical Parade, based on the trial and lynching of Leo Frank. Parade, directed by Hal Prince, and with a book by Alfred Uhry, won Brown the 1999 Tony Award for Best Original Musical Score. During this production, Livent, one of the producers of Parade, pulled out after reviews were not as positive as they'd hoped. RCA Victor, the other major producer, decided it would pull out as well. Brown said of the event in 1999, [...] "Livent dropped out shortly after the reviews came out. They announced they would not spend another dime on the show. RCA had an agreement to record all of Livent's shows. But when Livent pulled out of 'Parade,' the RCA higher-ups said they were pulling out, too. I {{had to go to}} Billy Rosenfield and ask him: 'What if <b>we</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> this record and you just distribute it?' Billy said, 'Sure.'" [...] Brown had to try to scrounge money from every corner, [...] "In the end, RCA put in $25,000, Lincoln Center put in a big chunk, around $200,000, including the producer Scott Rudin's $25,000, and there was a contribution from the Gilman and Gonzalez-Falla foundation, which has helped support a lot of musical theatre composers over the years, of $40,000. Even Roy Furman, the new guy at Livent, gave us a little money. Somehow, we pulled it together." [...] Livent also was struggling at the time because the company had mishandled funds while allying for bankruptcy protection.|$|E

2500|$|Chesterton's {{style and}} {{thinking}} were all his own, however, and his conclusions were often opposed {{to those of}} Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. In his book Heretics, Chesterton has this to say of Wilde: [...] "The same lesson [...] was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar Wilde. [...] It is the carpe diem religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw." [...] More briefly, and with a closer approximation of Wilde's own style, he writes in Orthodoxy concerning the necessity of making symbolic sacrifices for the gift of creation: [...] "Oscar Wilde said that sunsets were not valued because <b>we</b> could not <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> sunsets. But Oscar Wilde was wrong; <b>we</b> can <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> sunsets. <b>We</b> can <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> them by not being Oscar Wilde." ...|$|R
