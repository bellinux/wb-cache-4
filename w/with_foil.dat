5|$|With {{contamination}} of the Excedrin at the source having been ruled out, investigators began to focus their investigation on the end-users of the product. The FBI began an investigation into possible product tampering having {{been the source of}} the poison. At the time, Excedrin was packaged in plastic bottles with the mouth of the bottle sealed <b>with</b> <b>foil</b> and the lid secured to the bottle with plastic wrap.|$|E

50|$|Internally, {{the church}} is divided into nave and aisles by a nave arcade of pointed arched {{openings}} supported on clustered cast iron columns. In the spandrels of the arched openings are timber panels <b>with</b> <b>foiled</b> cutouts. Arched braced timber roof trusses support the roof and these also feature timber panels <b>with</b> <b>foiled</b> cutouts. Entrances from the transepts are concealed with timber panelled boxes around the doors. Above these boxes are large wheel windows, glazed with coloured glass. Lining the side aisles are lancets generally glazed with stained glass panels. The chancel is divided from the nave by a pointed arch chancel screen. Within the chancel which has a semi-domed timber-framed ceiling, are four panels of early stained glass.|$|R
40|$|Present day target designs {{indicate}} that particle beams with 1 - 10 MJ and 100 - 500 TW, focused to intensities around 100 TW/cm 2 {{will be required}} to ignite targets with gains of 10 - 100. Due to uncertainties about the symmetry and stability of the implosion, these requirements may change by as much as an order of magnitude as more is learned. The particle beams will interact with target plasmas which have temperatures of several hundred electron volts and densities up to solid density. Under these conditions the main energy-loss mechanism is collisional, however, in the case of electrons, the orbits can be substantially altered by electric and magnetic fields. Experiments <b>with</b> thin <b>foils</b> have measured energy deposition enhancement by a factor of 5 - 10 <b>with</b> <b>foils</b> mounted in the anode, and by a factor of 20 or more <b>with</b> <b>foils</b> mounted on a stalk extending into the diode...|$|R
25|$|An -tall Modern Gothic {{exhibition}} cabinet {{now at the}} Metropolitan Museum of Art {{is attributed}} to Pabst, and was once attributed also to Furness. It features cameo-carved doors in maple and walnut, painted glass panels backed <b>with</b> <b>foil,</b> a shingled-roof top, and ornate brass hardware. This tour de force piece is reminiscent of Furness's bank buildings of the late-1870s, although recent scholarship discounts Furness's participation in its design.|$|E
25|$|Leyden jars or more {{powerful}} devices employing flat glass plates alternating <b>with</b> <b>foil</b> conductors were used exclusively up until about 1900, when {{the invention of}} wireless (radio) created a demand for standard capacitors, and the steady move to higher frequencies required capacitors with lower inductance. More compact construction methods began to be used, such as a flexible dielectric sheet (like oiled paper) sandwiched between sheets of metal foil, rolled or folded into a small package.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike the USA and Canada {{which by}} policy never declare issued money invalid, Sweden {{and most other}} European {{countries}} have a date when older series of banknotes or older coin designs are invalid and are no longer legal tender. [...] From the years 2001 to 2008 banknotes and coins were circulated at a near constant level of around 12,000 krona per capita, but in 2006 a modified 1000-kronor banknote with a motion security strip was produced. Within 7 years the banknotes without the strip were declared invalid,leaving only a radically reduced number of banknotes <b>with</b> <b>foil</b> valid. The Vasa 1000-kronor banknotes without the foil strip became invalid after 31 December 2013, and the pieces with the foil strip are invalid after 30 June 2016. Also the Swish mobile payment system was established in Sweden in 2012 and become a popular alternative to cash payments.|$|E
