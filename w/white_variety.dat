5|$|During {{the early}} part of the 18thcentury, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, kept red and white King Charles type spaniels for hunting. The duke {{recorded}} that they were able to keep up with a trotting horse. His estate was named Blenheim in honour of his victory at the Battle of Blenheim. Because of this influence, the red and <b>white</b> <b>variety</b> of the King Charles Spaniel and thus the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel became known as the Blenheim.|$|E
5|$|The red and <b>white</b> <b>variety</b> of toy spaniel {{was first}} seen in {{paintings}} by Titian, including the Venus of Urbino (1538), {{where a small}} dog {{is used as a}} symbol of female seductiveness. Further paintings featuring these toy spaniels were created by Palma Vecchio and Paolo Veronese during the 16th century. These dogs already had high domed heads with short noses, although the muzzles were more pointed than they are today. These Italian toy spaniels may have been crossed with local small dogs such as the Maltese and also with imported Chinese dogs. The Papillon is the continental descendant of similar toy-sized spaniels.|$|E

25|$|Javas {{had nearly}} {{vanished}} {{by the end}} of the 20th century, having been pushed to fringes of the poultry world by the intense focus on one or two breeds by commercial growers, and the introduction of innumerable new and exotic breeds to poultry fancy. Beginning in the 1990s, breeders and conservation organizations began to make a more concerted effort to save the Java. In particular, the Garfield Farm Museum in Illinois has played a pivotal role in the preservation of Javas in the 21st century. Beginning with Mottled and Black Javas, sports from the Garfield flock have revived the <b>White</b> <b>variety.</b> The Garfield Farm was also supported by the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, which hatched Java chicks as part of their exhibit on genetics.|$|E

It is generally somewhat irregular in shape (it may be convex or concave at maturity), with a wavy margin that is rolled inward when young. Caps grow in a distorted shape when fruit bodies are closely clustered. The cap surface is generally dry and smooth, although mature specimens may show cracking. Viewed from above, the caps of mature specimens resemble somewhat those of chanterelles. The flesh is thick, white, firm, brittle, and bruises yellow to orange-brown.

The stipe, typically [...] long and [...] thick, is either white or the same color as the cap, and is sometimes off-center. It is easy to overlook the mushrooms when they are situated amongst gilled mushrooms and boletes, because the cap and stipe are fairly nondescript and the mushrooms must be turned over to reveal their spines.

2500|$|Gamay noir is {{now known}} to be a cross of Pinot noir and the ancient <b>white</b> <b>variety</b> Gouais, the latter a Central European variety that was {{probably}} introduced to northeastern France by the Romans. The grape brought relief to the village growers following the decline of the Black Death. In contrast to the Pinot noir variety, Gamay ripened two weeks earlier and was less difficult to cultivate. It also produced a strong, fruitier wine in a much larger abundance. In July 1395, the Duke of Burgundy Philippe the Bold outlawed the cultivation of Gamay as being [...] "a very bad and disloyal plant", {{due in part to the}} variety occupying land that could be used for the more [...] "elegant" [...] Pinot noir. Sixty years later, Philippe the Good issued another edict against Gamay, in which he stated the reason for the ban was that [...] "The Dukes of Burgundy are known as the lords of the best wines in Christendom. We will maintain our reputation". The edicts had the effect of pushing Gamay plantings southward, out of the main region of Burgundy and into the granite based soils of Beaujolais where the grape thrived.|$|E

40|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the purple}} and <b>white</b> <b>varieties</b> of the Java tea plant could be mistakenly considered {{the same if}} both varieties were not examined properly. The collection of 14 samples of java tea from the various locations in Indonesia and Malaysia showed that the Java tea varieties were distinguishable by the characteristic of colour of corolla and calyx, leaf shape and the colour of stem. The purple varieties had purple tint on the corolla and calyx. The <b>white</b> <b>varieties</b> had <b>white</b> corolla and the calyx colour was green. Generally, the <b>white</b> <b>varieties</b> produce rhomboid shape leaves with both acute and acuminate apex, the leaf base is either cuneate or narrowly cuneaete. The purple varieties produce ovate shaped leaves with acute leaf tip and an obtuse leaf base. Even though both Indonesia and Malaysia <b>white</b> <b>varieties</b> look the same at first sight, the difference was observed in the colour of stem, stamen and calyx. The colour of stem, and calyx were green for the Malaysia varieties while the colour of stern and calyx were purple, slightly green for the Indonesia varieties. The stamen of the <b>white</b> <b>varieties</b> from Indonesia had a bright clear purple tint. While the stamen of the <b>white</b> <b>varieties</b> from Malaysia had a slight purple, almost white colouration. Other than that, leaf size of the Malaysia varieties were smaller compared to the Indonesia varieties. Also, there were two <b>white</b> java tea <b>varieties</b> W 14 (Perumnas) and WM 2 (Perak) that had ovate shape leaves similar to the leaf shape of the purple varieties. The external morphological characteristics of the purple variety from both Indonesia and Malaysia were the same.

2500|$|Over centuries, the Grenache vine has {{produced}} color mutation vines with berries of all range of colors. While Grenache noir or [...] "red" [...] Grenache {{is the most}} well known, Grenache blanc or [...] "white" [...] Grenache {{is a very important}} grape variety in France where it is the fourth most widely planted <b>white</b> <b>variety</b> after Ugni blanc, Chardonnay and Semillon. Like Grenache noir, it is a permitted variety in the blends of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. In Southern France and Sardinia, the mutants Grenache Rose and Grenache gris are also found making pale rosé and lightly tinted white wines. [...] "Hairy Grenache" [...] (Garnacha Peluda as known in Spain) is a Grenache variant evolved to grow fuzz on the underside of its leaves to protect the vine from transpiration in hot climates, [...] "like the corresponding fuzz on rosemary or other mediterranean plants." [...] Compared to its more widely planted cousin, it produces wines lower in alcohol and higher in acidity that show spicy and savory notes more readily as they age. [...] It was not widely replanted after phylloxera as it was not well-adapted to making the vins doux naturels (see Fortified wine) that were [...] "all the rage" [...] at the time. [...] The vine known as Garnacha Tintorera is a synonym for the teinturier grape Alicante which is a crossing of Grenache and Petite Bouschet. In 1961, a cross between Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon produced the French wine grape Marselan.|$|E

60|$|Dr. W. Ogle has {{communicated to}} me a curious case. He {{gathered}} in Switzerland 100 flower-stems {{of the common}} blue variety of the monkshood (Aconitum napellus), {{and not a single}} flower was perforated; he then gathered 100 stems of a <b>white</b> <b>variety</b> growing close by, and every one of the open flowers had been perforated. (11/13. Dr. Ogle 'Popular Science Review' July 1869 page 267. Bailey 'American Naturalist' November 1873 page 690. Gentry ibid May 1875 page 264.) This surprising difference {{in the state of the}} flowers may be attributed with much probability to the blue variety being distasteful to bees, from the presence of the acrid matter which is so general in the Ranunculaceae, and to its absence in the <b>white</b> <b>variety</b> in correlation with the loss of the blue tint. According to Sprengel, this plant is strongly proterandrous (11/14. 'Das Entdeckte' etc. page 278.); it would therefore be more or less sterile unless bees carried pollen from the younger to the older flowers. Consequently the <b>white</b> <b>variety,</b> the flowers of which were always bitten instead of being properly entered by the bees, would fail to yield the full number of seeds and would be a comparatively rare plant, as Dr. Ogle informs me was the case.|$|E

60|$|The {{following}} case is {{much more}} remarkable, and evidently perplexed Gartner, whose strong wish it was to draw a broad line of distinction between species and varieties. In the genus Verbascum, he made, during eighteen years, {{a vast number of}} experiments, and crossed no less than 1085 flowers and counted their seeds. Many of these experiments consisted in crossing white and yellow varieties of both V. lychnitis and V. blattaria with nine other species and their hybrids. That the white and yellow flowered plants of these two species are really varieties, no one has doubted; and Gartner actually raised in the case of both species one variety from the seed of the other. Now in two of his works (16/15. 'Kenntniss der Befruchtung' s. 137; 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 92, 181. On raising the two varieties from seed see s. 307.) he distinctly asserts that crosses between similarly-coloured flowers yield more seed than between dissimilarly-coloured; so that the yellow-flowered variety of either species (and conversely with the white-flowered variety), when crossed with pollen of its own kind, yields more seed than when crossed with that of the white variety; and so it is when differently coloured species are crossed. The general results may be seen in the Table {{at the end of his}} volume. In one instance he gives (16/16. 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 216.) the following details; but I must premise that Gartner, to avoid exaggerating the degree of sterility in his crosses, always compares the MAXIMUM number obtained from a cross with the AVERAGE number naturally given by the pure mother-plant. The <b>white</b> <b>variety</b> of V. lychnitis, naturally fertilised by its own pollen, gave from an AVERAGE of twelve capsules ninety-six good seeds in each; whilst twenty flowers fertilised with pollen from the yellow variety of this same species, gave as the MAXIMUM only eighty-nine good seeds; so that we have the proportion of 1000 to 908, according to Gartner's usual scale. I should have thought it possible that so small a difference in fertility might have been accounted for by the evil effects of the necessary castration; but Gartner shows that the <b>white</b> <b>variety</b> of V. lychnitis, when fertilised first by the <b>white</b> <b>variety</b> of V. blattaria, and then by the yellow variety of this species, yielded seed in the proportion of 622 to 438; and in both these cases castration was performed. Now the sterility which results from the crossing of the differently coloured varieties of the same species, is fully as great as that which occurs in many cases when distinct species are crossed. Unfortunately Gartner compared the results of the first unions alone, and not the sterility of the two sets of hybrids produced from the <b>white</b> <b>variety</b> of V. lychnitis when fertilised by the white and yellow varieties of V. blattaria, for it is probable that they would have differed in this respect.|$|E
