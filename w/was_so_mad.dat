25|$|In 1982 Marriott {{was back}} on the road with Jim Leverton (bass, backing vocals), former Steppenwolf keyboardist Goldy McJohn and Chicago born drummer Fallon Williams III. This {{grouping}} was originally set to be called The Official Receivers, The Three Trojans (after McJohn departed) or The Pie but ended up being billed by promoters as Humble Pie. McJohn was let go after suffering drug troubles and the remaining trio toured Australia in October 1982 billed mostly as Small Faces to entice patrons. In January 1983 Leverton ran into trouble at US Immigration and was deported back to England. Marriott based himself in the Atlanta, Georgia area, since that was where his second wife, Pamela Stephens, was from, and continued to tour clubs as Humble Pie. Atlanta musician Keith Christopher (from The Brains) took over bass and a young guitarist from Tennessee, Tommy Johnson, joined as well. And after a hoped for deal with Capricorn Records in nearby Macon fell through after that label's second collapse, this line-up went into Pyramid Eye Studios in Chattanooga, Tennessee to record three songs for a projected album, but nothing further came from it. After Johnson missed a show, he was replaced by Phil Dix. The band was then scheduled to record demos with Yes/ELP producer Eddy Offord at Eddy's studio in Atlanta with Rick Richards (also from The Brains and soon to find fame with the Georgia Satellites) as the new guitarist. But when Rick and Keith missed rehearsals, Steve <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> that he not only fired Rick but Keith as well. The recordings were done with Fallon on drums and Dave Hewitt (ex-Babe Ruth) on bass. But when these demos failed to attract another record deal and Pamela left Steve for another man, Steve disbanded this version of the Pie and departed the US to return to England in late 1983.|$|E
500|$|After audiences {{began to}} view Van Winkle as a novelty act and a pop star {{rather than a}} {{legitimate}} rapper, his popularity began to decline. Detroit-based rapper Eminem states that when he first heard [...] "Ice Ice Baby", [...] "I felt like I didn't want to rap anymore. I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>mad,</b> because he was making it real hard for me." [...] Van Winkle lost some credibility among hip hop fans, but later began to regain some success, attracting a new audience outside of the mainstream audience that had formerly accepted him, and then rejected him. [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] {{continues to be the}} song that Van Winkle is best known for internationally, although Van Winkle states that his American fans like his newer music better.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{explained}} that the cast listing for the episode, along with [...] "Patient X" [...] was [...] "longer than most cast lists you'll ever see on a TV series". In order {{to allow for the}} increased expenses of hiring additional actors, Carter and the producers of the series talked Fox into allowing the episodes to be slightly more expensive because they would lead into the soon-to-be-released X-Files movie. Carter explained, [...] "we convinced them to spend the extra money to do this extra special work because it was all leading up to [...] when the X-Files movie would be released." [...] In addition, the child he gave the message to was a young boy and the son of production manager J.P. Finn. Rob Bowman originally intended to direct the episode but, due to reshoots, he was unable to do it, resulting in Carter directing. Bowman later recounted, [...] "I was supposed to direct 'The Red and the Black' [...] but we were prepping for the reshoots [...] so I couldn't do it. [...] Chris had to direct this episode. He <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> at me." [...] When filming the scene where Mulder and Scully go to a medic station, Carter made homage to the medical drama ER, filming it entirely with a Steadicam.|$|E

2500|$|When Pu Tong Seal {{brought back}} the captive to Theizang, Pu Tong Seal's {{father-in-law}} thought that his son-in-law's action was detrimental to his people, and had great concern and fear that the Burmans would invade Theizang, which was situated nearby the Kalay valley. The father-in-law <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>mad,</b> and wasn't ready yet to condone this sort of behavior that could jeopardize and endanger their livelihoods, that he hit Pu Tong Seal with a long stick known as [...] "Ak ngawciang" [...] locally, that was usually used to keep chickens away from their grains while exposing them to the sunlight. The father-in-law fervently hoped that a peaceful solution would soon be found.|$|E
2500|$|The Redskins {{played in}} the NFL Championship one more time before a quarter-century drought that did not end until the 1972 season. With former Olympic gold {{medalist}} Dudley DeGroot as their new head coach, the Redskins went 8–2 during the 1945 season. One {{of the most impressive}} performances came from Sammy Baugh, who had a completion percentage of [...]703. They ended the season by losing to the Cleveland Rams in the 1945 NFL Championship Game on December 16, 1945, 15–14. The one-point margin of victory came under scrutiny because of a safety that occurred early in the game. In the first quarter, the Redskins had the ball at their own 5-yard line. Dropping back into the end zone, quarterback Sammy Baugh threw to an open receiver, but the ball hit the goal post (which at the time was on the goal line instead of {{at the back of the}} end zone) and bounced back to the ground in the end zone. Under the rules at the time, this was ruled as a safety and thus gave the Rams a 2–0 lead. It was that safety that proved to be the margin of victory. Owner Marshall <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>mad</b> at the outcome that he became a major force in passing the following major rule change after the season: A forward pass that strikes the goal posts is automatically ruled incomplete. This later became known as the [...] "Baugh/Marshall Rule".|$|E
