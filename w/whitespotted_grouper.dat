5000|$|The <b>whitespotted</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus coeruleopunctatus is the type-host of Pseudorhabdosynochus argus. The type-locality is {{the barrier}} reef off Noum√©a, New Caledonia.|$|E
50|$|As all fish, the <b>whitespotted</b> <b>grouper</b> {{has many}} {{parasite}} species. The diplectanid monogenean Pseudorhabdosynochus bacchus is a parasite of the gills. Other parasites include copepods and species of Haliotrema (Monogenea) on the gills and the opecoelid digenean Cainocreadium epinepheli in the caeca.|$|E
50|$|The <b>whitespotted</b> <b>grouper</b> {{is found}} in shallow water in the Indo-Pacific region. Its range extends from the coast of East Africa and the Persian Gulf eastwards to Japan, China, Indonesia, Fiji and Tonga. A record from Western Australia may have been of another species.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>whitespotted</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus coeruleopunctatus) is an Indo-Pacific {{species of}} {{saltwater}} grouper. The distribution ranges from East Africa, South Africa and the Persian Gulf east to Fiji and Tonga. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
5000|$|The <b>whitespotted</b> <b>grouper</b> has a {{wide range}} and is common in places and {{uncommon}} in others. The population trend for this fish is unknown but it is caught in artisan fisheries throughout its range. The fish is found {{in a number of}} protected areas and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|E
50|$|The <b>whitespotted</b> <b>grouper</b> is a demersal, shallow-water, reef-associated fish. It is {{generally}} found in rocky areas, or near where coral {{is growing in}} deep lagoons, or on outer reef slopes or channels, often near or in caves. It is not a schooling fish and is usually seen singly. It feeds on small fish and crustaceans, with crustaceans making up the greatest part of its diet. Little is known about its reproduction and life history.|$|E
50|$|The <b>whitespotted</b> <b>grouper</b> is a {{moderately}} deep-bodied fish growing {{to a maximum}} length of about 76 cm. There are three to five rows of teeth in the lower jaw. The dorsal fin has eleven spines and about sixteen soft rays and the anal fin has three spines and eight soft rays. The pelvic fins are short and the caudal fin is rounded. The top edge of the opercular cover is only slightly convex and the posterior edge curves at an acute angle. The head, body and dorsal fin are dark brownish-grey, spotted with large white blotches. In large adults, over about 30 cm, the white patches tend to merge into wavy bands or mottling.|$|E
40|$|Pseudorhabdosynochus bacchus sp. nov. (Diplectanidae) is {{described}} from the gills of the <b>whitespotted</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus coeruleopunctatus collected off New Caledonia, South Pacific, {{and is the}} first monogenean reported from this fish. It has a characteristic quadriloculate male organ, with both cone and tube of similar short length (10 - 12 mu m). The morphology of its sclerotised vagina, with two chambers of equal size, differentiates it from all other species of the genus. Other rare Pseudorhabdosynochus species and specimens of an undescribed species of Haliotrema (Ancyrocephalidae) were also found, but in insufficient number to allow description...|$|E
