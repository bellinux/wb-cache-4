"The {{families}} of the Sago miners deserve {{to know what happened}} in that mine,” Byrd said. “Just as importantly, miners and their families across this country <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> steps are being taken to prevent others from ever experiencing such pain." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{have seen}} her play, as we all have, and oh, that is divine; but I have always <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> Madame Bernhardt herself--her fiery self. I have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{beautiful}} character.|$|R
60|$|We {{stopped and}} {{talked a little}} while about the sharks, and then the old man asked Rectus why he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> morning, whether he was a Minorcan or not.|$|R
6000|$|... "To humiliate you so, Alice! I am a dastard. I am {{not such}} a dastard as you think me. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you {{would be willing to}} do all these things, but I would never have let you do them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not mean," [...] he said, {{speaking}} low but strongly, [...] "that {{in accepting}} them you accept me. I only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you {{will talk to}} me of what I said, or at any rate think of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|I'm {{not seeking}} to prevent you. What am I asking for? I {{only want to}} see you. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I'm close to you. I want to touch your hand. I {{want to think of}} you. What harm can that do you? ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. HOPE. I don't want {{anything}} extravagant, of course; if they're {{going to pay}} their 10 per cent, regularly, and Tom can have his money out at any time--[There is a faint whistle from the swing.] I only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it's a thoroughly genuine thing.|$|E
60|$|Where was Unc' Billy Possum? That is what Farmer Brown's boy <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>That</b> is what Bowser the Hound <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> Where was Unc' Billy Possum?

[...] She pressed his arm gently, significantly, where he sat {{provisionally}} in the chair beside her, and he was afraid to speak lest he should scare away the hope her words gave him.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was ready}} for the {{sacrifice}}--sacrifice of pride, of honour, of peace of mind--but he did <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> that sacrifice would be really needed and that when made it would not be in vain: and in order to gain this end he put a final question to her: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want no thanks," [...] he answered, almost roughly. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I was {{justified}} in what I did.

6000|$|... "Yes; he <b>wanted</b> me <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that,</b> and he <b>wanted</b> me <b>to</b> <b>know</b> also <b>that</b> the {{knowledge}} {{had come to}} me from my bishop.

He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> she <b>knew</b> him, <b>that</b> she was aware. He wanted it said that there was something between them. So he stood anxiously watching, looking at her as she went down the road. He called to Tilly.|$|R

6000|$|... "That's true," [...] she cried--"very true. Little Emma, grow up {{a better}} woman than your aunt. Be {{infinitely}} cleverer and not half so conceited. Now, Mr. Knightley, {{a word or}} two more, and I have done. As far as good intentions went, we were both right, and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed." ...|$|E
6000|$|Major Chevenix smoked awhile, looking now at {{his cigar}} ash, now at me. ‘I’m a soldier myself,’ he says presently, ‘and I’ve {{been out in}} my time and hit my man. I don’t want to run any one into a corner for an affair that was at all {{necessary}} or correct. At the same time, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> much, and I’ll take your word of honour for it. Otherwise, I shall be very sorry, but the doctor must be called in.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} to put up with this," [...] he spluttered, [...] "not a day longer, do you hear, miss. Bless my soul, this is the third time, miss [...] . the third time!

50|$|Billy's mom is on {{the phone}} with Kim and the two talk about their love for Billy. Josie just <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> her son is ok. Kim reassures her that he's fine.

6000|$|... "Anyhow, his keenness isn't {{enough to}} make him turn out for house-fielding. If you really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that's</b> why you've got your first instead of him. You sweated away, and {{improved}} your fielding twenty per cent.; and I happened to be talking to Firby-Smith and found that young Mike had been shirking his, so out he went. A bad field's bad enough, but a slack field wants skinning." ...|$|R
60|$|But now, {{be still}} better to me, and write and say how you are. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you are quite well; {{if you can}} tell me so, do. You have told me of a new book, which is {{excellent}} news, and I hear from another quarter that it will consist of your 'Readings' and 'Remarks,' a sort of book most likely to penetrate widely and be popular in a good sense. Would it not be well to bring out such a work volume by volume at intervals? Is it this you are contemplating?...|$|E
6000|$|To {{which his}} reply {{had been just}} of the happiest.

Say, however, I am a galantuomo--which I devoutly hope: I'm like a chicken, at best, chopped up and smothered in sauce; cooked down as a creme de volaille, with half the parts left out. Your father's the natural fowl running about the bassecour. His feathers, movements, his sounds--those are the parts that, with me, are left out." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{think some}} of you will fancy this almost too good news to be true, and yet the very news which you want to hear. I {{think some of}} you have been saying as you read this, [...] "All this is blessed and comforting news for poor fellows lying wounded in a hospital, or {{fretting}} their souls away about the wives and children they have left behind; blessed and comforting news; but we want something more than that even. We have to fight and to kill; {{we want to be}} sure that God's blessing is on our fighting and our killing; we have to go into battle; and we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there, too, we are doing God's work, and to be sure that God is on our side." ...|$|E

'Oh, what has love done with me?' she cried desperately. 'I was so proud of my brother and so utterly devoted to him. But I loved you so much that there wasn't any room in my heart for the past. I forgot all my unhappiness and all my loss. And even now they seem so little to me beside your love that it's you I think of first. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I can love you freely. I'll {{be satisfied}} if you'll only tell me that when you sent George out that night, you didn't know he'd be killed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, I {{understand}} that, John; {{but you see}} I have altogether set my mind on this matter. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> my girl is {{not going}} to be married for her money; and, at any rate, that deed makes you master of the Reigate estates for the next thirteen years; so the only thing that I really want of you is to let the girl be called your ward instead of your niece, and that she and everyone else shall be in ignorance that she is an heiress. So far from doing the girl a wrong, you will be doing her a benefit; and as I have explained the whole matter to our lawyers, no one can possibly think that the thing has been done from any motive whatever except that of affording me satisfaction." ...|$|E

"Father {{says that}} you are only passing through Tasajara to-day, as you did through Sidon five years ago," [...] {{she said with a}} smiling earnestness that he fancied however was the one new phase of her character. [...] "But I won't believe it! At least we will not accept another visit quite as {{accidental}} as that, even though you brought us twice the good fortune you did then. You see, we have not forgotten it if you have, Mr. Grant. And unless you want us to believe that your fairy gifts will turn some day to leaves and ashes, you will promise to stay with us tonight, and let me {{show you some of the}} good we have done with them. Perhaps you don't know, or don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> it was I who got up this 'Library and Home Circle of the Sisters of Tasajara' which we are to open to-day. And can you imagine why? You remember--or have you forgotten--that you once affected to be concerned at the social condition of the young ladies on the plains of Sidon? Well, Mr. Grant, this is gotten up in order that the future Mr. Grants who wander may find future Miss Billingses who are worthy to converse with them and entertain them, and who no longer wear men's hats and live on the public road." ...|$|E
5000|$|Inexperienced {{writers are}} often advised to show {{rather than to}} describe. One of the mysteries of Gallico's style is its {{effectiveness}} despite his constant violation of this rule.

[...] When he <b>wants</b> us <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Mouche is innocent, he tells us of her [...] "innocence and primitive mind." [...] When he <b>wants</b> us <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Rhayader has a warm heart in his crippled body, he says [...] "His body was warped, but his heart was filled with love for wild and hunted things." [...] Many of Gallico's stories are told as a string of assertions and generalities, illuminated only by touches of the particular and specific.|$|R
