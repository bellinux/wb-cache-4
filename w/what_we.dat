5|$|Men {{are like}} plants: the {{goodness}} and flavour {{of the fruit}} proceeds from the peculiar soil and exposition in which they grow.

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are also}} many incompatibilists who reject the {{argument}} {{because they believe that}} the will is free in a stronger sense called libertarianism. These philosophers affirm the course of the world is either a) not completely determined by natural law where natural law is intercepted by physically independent agency, b) determined by indeterministic natural law only, or c) determined by indeterministic natural law in line with the subjective effort of physically non-reducible agency. Under Libertarianism, the will {{does not have to be}} deterministic and, therefore, it is potentially free. Critics of the second proposition (b) accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom. They argue as follows: if our will is not determined by anything, then we desire <b>what</b> <b>we</b> desire by pure chance. And if <b>what</b> <b>we</b> desire is purely accidental, we are not free. So if our will is not determined by anything, we are not free.|$|E

40|$|Every society {{up to now}} has {{attempted}} to give an answer to a few fundamental questions: Who are we as a collectivity? <b>What</b> are <b>we</b> for one another? Where and in <b>what</b> are <b>we?</b> <b>What</b> do <b>we</b> want; <b>what</b> do <b>we</b> desire; <b>what</b> are <b>we</b> lacking? Society must define its identity, its articulation, the world, its relations {{to the world and}} to the objects it contains, its needs and its desires. Without the answer to these questions, without these definitions, there can be no human world, no society, no culture for everything would be an undifferentiated chaos. The role of imaginary significations is to provide an answer to these questions, an answer that, obviously, neither reality, nor rationality can provide. (Castoriadis, 1998, pp. 146 147...|$|R

5|$|The Kingdom of the Picts {{as it was}} in {{the early}} 8th century, when Bede was writing, was largely the same as the kingdom of the Scots in the reign of Alexander I (1107–1124). However, by the tenth century, the Pictish kingdom was {{dominated}} by <b>what</b> <b>we</b> can recognise as Gaelic culture, and had developed a traditional story of an Irish conquest around the ancestor of the contemporary royal dynasty, Cináed mac Ailpín (Kenneth MacAlpin).|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly while negro slavery {{alone was}} {{in the mind of}} the Congress which {{proposed}} the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do say, and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.|$|E

5|$|Unhalfbricking is {{the third}} album by the British folk rock band Fairport Convention and their second album {{released}} in 1969.
