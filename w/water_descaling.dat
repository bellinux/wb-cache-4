50|$|Sulfamic acid {{is used as}} an acidic {{cleaning}} agent, sometimes pure or as {{a component}} of proprietary mixtures, typically for metals and ceramics. It is frequently used for removing rust and limescale, replacing the more volatile and irritating hydrochloric acid, which is however cheaper. It is often a component of household descaling agents, for example, Lime-A-Way Thick Gel contains up to 8% sulfamic acid and pH 2-2.2, or detergents used for removal of limescale. When compared to most of the common strong mineral acids, sulfamic acid has desirable <b>water</b> <b>descaling</b> properties, low volatility, low toxicity. It forms water-soluble salts of calcium and ferric iron.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{character}} of plate rolling, the temperature model was developed by considering the influence of radiation, convection, <b>water</b> <b>descaling,</b> and roll conductivity and deformation energy. The factors affect the finishing temperature of the plate were analyzed, including the holding time during control rolling, rolling speed, slab temperature and pass number. Holding time, rolling speed and slab temperature have significant influence on finishing temperature, and pass number has great influence on finishing temperature of thick plate, but has little on finishing temperature of media plate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{building}} upon studies [1 ‐ 8] {{describes a}} subset of the High Pressure <b>Water</b> (HPW) <b>descaling</b> strategy developed at Tata Steel UK to optimise descaling set-ups for range of steel grades prone to adherent primary scale such as in high alloy steels (Si, Ni, Cr). Effective primary descaling, i. e. descaling post furnace discharge via washbox or alternative technologies is imperative to obtain good surface quality and conditioning of the surface state as well as the morphology, growth and behaviour of the secondary/tertiary scale. This paper primarily focuses on analytical descaling concepts for both mechanical and thermal outputs for flat jet nozzle and process factors. This approach has been linked to recent developments for oxide scale evolution during rolling and descaling [8]...|$|R
40|$|Effects of mould flux {{contaminant}} on scale-steel adhesion and hydraulic descaling {{of scale}} formed on slabs were investigated. In this investigation, stainless steel type 304 (austenitic with 18 % Cr and 8 % Ni) and specific mould fluxes were used when growing the scale on contaminated samples under simulated industrial reheating conditions, with subsequent high pressure <b>water</b> hydraulic <b>descaling.</b> The basic hypothesis {{was that the}} steel-scale adhesion depends on the microstructure of different phases present in the scale, the segregation of specific elements at the interface and the interfacial morphology of the scale after reheating. It was found that mould flux contaminant decreases scale-steel adhesion and therefore improved the descaling effectiveness significantly compared to non contaminated stainless steel. The descaling effectiveness of contaminated and uncontaminated slab was dependent {{to the presence of}} metal free paths (chromite layers along the austenite grains boundaries) and the presence of unoxidized metal in the scale due to nickel enrichment at the interface. Compared to the uncontaminated samples, the descaling of contaminated samples was efficient which could be {{due to the fact that}} some mechanisms which increase scale– steel adhesion (notably nickel enrichment at the interface) were considerably reduced. For all contaminated samples, the descaling effectiveness after visual observation were close to 100 % and it was found that mould flux type 832 (low basicity) gave a high descaling efficiency with better steel surface quality after descaling compared to mould fluxes type 810 and RF 1.
