I think what you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> as an opener is not getting out... What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is {{patience}} and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.|$|E

25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which {{was not the kind}} of cricket I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch.</b> People who pay to see a Test are entitled to see a real match, not a tactical tie-up. I think it is a fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't get out of my head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E

25|$|New {{forms of}} New Media are {{emerging}} like Web 2.0 tools Facebook and YouTube, along with {{video games and}} the consoles they are played on. It is helping to make video games and video game consoles branch out into New Media as well. Gamers on YouTube post videos of them playing video games they like and that people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch.</b> Cultural changes are happening because people can upload their gaming experiences to a Web 2.0 tool like Facebook and YouTube {{for the world to}} see. Consoles like the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 have WiFi connectivity and chat rooms on most of their video games that allow gamer-to-gamer conversations around the world. They also allow people to connect to YouTube, so if they stream/record a gamer, it allows for easy uploading to YouTube for the world to see. Even the older video game consoles are becoming new media because YouTube can display the walkthroughs and let's plays of the game. YouTube gaming is evolving because some YouTubers are getting wealthy and earning money from their videos. The more people that become YouTube members, the popular YouTube becomes and the more it starts emerging as a new source of media, along with video games and consoles. The chat room/online gaming/WiFi consoles are getting the highest increase in popularity because they are not only the most advanced, but because of the newest video games being created {{that the majority of the}} gaming community wants to buy, play and watch. The older video games and consoles also get popularity, but from YouTube's capabilities of uploading them to the gamer's channels for everyone to see. The older games get popularity from the communities nostalgia of the game(s), and the old school graphics and gameplay that made people see how old-school technology was the best at some point in time. Facebook helps those video games and consoles get popularity as well. People can upload the videos they create to Facebook as well. Facebook is a much larger website with a lot more users, so people use Facebook to spread their gaming content as well.|$|E

Hemingway critic Wendolyn Tetlow maintains that in [...] "Indian Camp", sexuality culminates in [...] "butchery-style" [...] birth and bloody death, and that Nick's anxiety is obvious when he {{turns away from the}} butchery. The story reaches a climax when Nick's [...] "heightened awareness" [...] of evil causes him to turn away from the experience.

Despite this, Shales said that 30 Rock [...] "is not a self-important bore like Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip", and praised Tracy Morgan's performance as Tracy Jordan. The New York Times Alessandra Stanley praised Alec Baldwin's [...] "slyly absurd comic presence that is bigger and brighter than any joke or character actor on the show", but mentioned that [...] "Nothing very funny happens on 30 Rock until Alec Baldwin enters the room, and suddenly this new NBC sitcom comes alive".

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series.

He thought the performances were fairly solid and that the overall message about the ozone layer was [...] "unsubtle but not too sledgehammery". DeCandido praised Patrick Stewart's performance of Captain Picard, noting that his [...] "anger and outrage and justified self-righteousness at the kidnapping of children modulates nicely into diplomacy when negotiating with the Aldeans and amusingly into total discomfort when he has to actually deal directly with the children". He gave the episode a score of six out of ten. James Hunt, writing for Den of Geek, said that it was [...] "a decent enough story, but not in a way that makes you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> it".
