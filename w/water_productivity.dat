Outside these periods, irrigation is limited or even unnecessary if rainfall provides a minimum supply of water.

Total irrigation application is therefore not proportional to irrigation requirements throughout the crop cycle. While this inevitably results in plant drought stress and consequently in production loss, DI maximizes irrigation <b>water</b> <b>productivity,</b> which is the main limiting factor (English, 1990).
