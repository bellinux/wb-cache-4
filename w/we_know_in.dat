(Chuck) Foreman... it'll be fourth down. (Matt) Cavanaugh will let it run down for one final attempt, he'll let the seconds tick off to give Miami no opportunity whatsoever. (Whistle blows.)

Remember this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC News in New York City: John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the West Side of New York City, the most famous perhaps, of all of the Beatles, shot twice in the back, rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, dead on arrival. Hard {{to go back to the}} game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, we have to take. Frank?Gifford: (after a pause) Indeed, it is.|$|E

When he comes he rests on Mount Kenya and four other sacred mountains. Thunder is interpreted to be the movement of God, and lightning is God's weapon by means of which he clears the way when moving from one sacred place to another.|$|E
25|$|As <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> <b>in</b> mayflies the nymphs and {{the adults}} are {{specialized}} for {{two different ways}} of living; {{in the water and}} in the air. The only stage (instar) between these two is the subimago. In more primitive fossil forms, the preadult individuals had not just one instar but numerous ones (while the modern subimago do not eat, older and more primitive species with a subimagos were probably feeding in this phase of life too as the lines between the instars were much more diffuse and gradual than today). Adult form was reached several moults before maturity. They probably didn't have more instars after becoming fully mature. This way of maturing is how Apterygota do it, which moult even when mature, but not winged insects.|$|E

2500|$|In Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education (1971), the Supreme Court {{ordered the}} {{desegregation}} busing of poor black students to suburban white schools, and suburban white {{students to the}} city to try to integrate student populations. In Milliken v. Bradley (1974), the dissenting Justice William Douglas observed, [...] "The inner core of Detroit is now rather solidly black; and the blacks, <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> <b>in</b> many instances are likely to be poorer." [...] Likewise, in 1977, the Federal decision in Penick v. The Columbus Board of Education (1977) accelerated white flight from Columbus, Ohio. Although the racial desegregation of schools affected only public school districts, the most vehement opponents of racial desegregation have sometimes been whites whose children attended private schools.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{following}} {{the story of}} a central character, Redford Stevens, on the album was the idea of band manager Richard Nichols. According to Questlove, the album's protagonist Redford is [...] "the prototypical urban kid — young, gifted, black, and unraveling before our eyes," [...] and is based on [...] "a combination of maybe four to five people that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> Philadelphia." [...] Regarding the character, Black Thought said, [...] "Redford's story isn't uncommon in Philadelphia ... I remember not being able to imagine being alive as a 30-year-old. I didn't know many people who had lived to 30." [...] Inspiration for Redford was also culled from the Sufjan Stevens song [...] "Redford (For Yia-Yia & Pappou)" [...] from his album Michigan and the character Avon Barksdale from TV series The Wire. Some sources have interpreted Redford as an African-American everyman, though others have cautioned against this view, emphasizing his individual characteristics. For instance, Hilary Brown of Down Beat called Redford [...] "a romantic, not a thug; a philosopher, not an everyman," [...] and Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah wrote [...] "The mistake is to read Redford as being like anyone who has their back to the wall, or to see the album’s narrative as a universal story." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the simple}} solutions, the [...] "combined doors solution" [...] comes closest to a {{conditional}} solution, {{as we saw}} in the discussion of approaches using the concept of odds and Bayes theorem. It is based on the deeply rooted intuition that revealing information that is already known does not affect probabilities. But, knowing that the host can open one of the two unchosen doors to show a goat does not mean that opening a specific door would not affect the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen door. The point is, though <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>in</b> advance that the host will open a door and reveal a goat, we do not know which door he will open. If the host chooses uniformly at random between doors hiding a goat (as is the case in the standard interpretation), this probability indeed remains unchanged, but if the host can choose non-randomly between such doors, then the specific door that the host opens reveals additional information. The host can always open a door revealing a goat and (in the standard interpretation of the problem) the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen door does not change, but it is not because of the former that the latter is true. Solutions based on the assertion that the host's actions cannot affect the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen appear persuasive, but the assertion is simply untrue unless each of the host's two choices are equally likely, if he has a choice (...) [...] The assertion therefore needs to be justified; without justification being given, the solution is at best incomplete. The answer can be correct but the reasoning used to justify it is defective.|$|E
