500|$|Richard Harrington of The Washington Post {{felt that}} while the album could {{not live up to}} post-Thriller expectations, it would be [...] "considerably fairer to compare" [...] Bad with Off the Wall.

Richard Cromelin of the Los Angeles Times called Bad [...] "a fair-to-strong array of soul and rock blends", commenting that the record was [...] "not bad" [...] and was more [...] "reminiscent of Off the Walls uniform strength than Thrillers peaks and valleys." [...] Cromelin felt that it would be [...] "disappointing" [...] if this album's [...] "creative level" [...] is where Jackson <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b>|$|E

Tom (Aziz Ansari) volunteers to find Ron an assistant, but during job interviews he asks questions about [...] "real-world expertise", such as what tie he should wear to the club and what to text girls after a party. Tom brings forward a fast-talking candidate named Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz), whose personality closely resembles Tom's. Ron hates him right away. April (Aubrey Plaza) draws attention around the office for showing up late and slacking off at work. Bored with her internship, April insists she cannot wait to leave the parks department.

At the end of the episode, it is revealed that everything that happened since Maddy was stabbed was actually a dream and that Maddy actually died in Chantelle's attack.

Despite telling Maria she didn't kill Maddy, she actually confessed to the murder after Mark told her of the consequences about her lying about her boyfriend abusing her and killing Maddy.|$|E
500|$|It {{begins with}} Jackson in {{what seems to}} be a hotel, singing about his girlfriend. He is distressed because he found a silver card in with the name [...] "Alex" [...] on it. To him, it implies that [...] "Alex" [...] is another man who his girlfriend is with; thus, she is {{cheating}} on Jackson. However, as the story in the video unfolds, this is not true, because the girl takes on different identities (I.e. Eve, Diana, etc.) for her job as a high class call girl. [...] "Alex" [...] (which is also a girl's name), just happens to be one of them. The video alternates scenes from where Jackson is singing about his pain, to where the girl is being changed into her different identities and taking care of her jobs (mostly meeting with other men and even some women and sleeping with them). Towards the end of the video, Jackson has packed up his bags to leave town, because of his distress. A helicopter comes to pick him up from his house. The girl comes to Jackson's house and she asks his assistant (who knows the situation and aided Jackson in his departure) to let her in. It is likely she quit the job for him and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b> The assistant shakes his head, implying that he left. When she asks why, he drops a flutter of silver nameplates (including the one that said [...] "Alex") from a slot in the door. After that scene, Jackson is seen sleeping and smoke floats out the side of the screen. Having lost her love and without any alternative, the girl turns to her callgirl existence again. Her employer slaps her in the face and she is then seen being prepared for a new identity.|$|E
