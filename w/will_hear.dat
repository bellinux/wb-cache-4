5|$|Dr. Foster enlists Homer to help Ned {{learn how}} to {{appropriately}} express emotions. After several failed scripted insults, Homer manages to get Ned to open up about some of his repressed dislikes, finally admitting he hates his parents, after which he immediately feels better. Dr. Foster declares Flanders cured and he is immediately released. Outside the hospital, Ned is greeted by the townsfolk of Springfield. Ned promises that from now on, if anyone does something he does not like, they <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> about it, which Dr. Foster tells him is very healthy.|$|E
5|$|Once {{legislation}} is introduced, it is passed {{to one of}} the standing committees of the Senate. There are six such committees. As a whole, the Maryland General Assembly has fewer standing committees than any other state legislature in the United States. Each committee has between 10 and 15 members. Four of the standing committees deal primarily with legislation; the Budget and Taxation Committee, the Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee, the Finance Committee, and the Judicial Proceedings Committee. The Chairs of these legislative committees have the power to determine whether their committees <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> a bill, and they therefore have significant influence over legislation. The Executive Nominations Committee manages the Senate's responsibility to confirm gubernatorial appointments and makes recommendations of approval and disapproval to the body as a whole. Lastly, the Rules Committee sets the rules and procedures of the body. It also has the power to review legislation that has been introduced {{by a member of the}} Senate after the deadline for submission, and decide whether to refer it to a standing committee or let it die. Along with serving on the Senate committees, members of the Senate also serve on a number of joint committees with members of the House of Delegates.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers of}} the OSC derive from the Oregon Constitution’s Article VII. Like other supreme courts in the United States, the Oregon Supreme Court acts {{primarily}} as a court of appeals. They choose cases that are of legal significance or to unify lower court decisions. In this aspect the court has discretionary review over many of the cases appealed to the high court. Discretionary review allows the court to choose which cases it <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> on appeal. With those cases that are denied {{an appeal to the}} Supreme Court, the decision of the lower court becomes final and binding. As of 1995, the court only accepted one in eight appeals that were discretionary. The justices meet once per week in a formal conference in which only the justices are involved to determine rulings. Once a case is accepted, the court hears the case en banc. That is the court is not divided into panels, and instead all justices participate in all the cases, unless a justice recuses themselves due to a conflict of interest or other concern.|$|E

5|$|The {{subject-matter}} of {{a dispute}} must be justiciable before the High Court <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> the case. A decision by an executive authority will generally be considered non-justiciable if the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, and judges are ill-equipped {{to decide the}} case because of their limited training, experience and access to materials; if a judicial pronouncement could embarrass another branch of government or tie its hands {{in the conduct of}} affairs traditionally falling within its purview; or if the decision involves the exercise of a prerogative power that the democratically elected branches are entrusted to take care of. Nonetheless, a dispute may prima facie involve a non-justiciable area but the courts may decide that there is a justiciable matter within it, or the courts may be able to isolate a pure question of law from what is seemingly a non-justiciable issue. Because of the principle that all powers have legal limits, the Attorney-General's exercise of prosecutorial discretion and the power to pardon or grant clemency to convicted persons exercised by the President on the Cabinet's advice are both justiciable in exceptional cases, for instance, where the powers have been exercised unconstitutionally or in bad faith.|$|E

25|$|Along the African coast you <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> that dirge-like {{strain in}} all their songs, as at work or {{paddling}} their canoes to and from shore, they keep time to the music. On the southern plantations you <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> it also, and in the negro melodies every where, plaintive and melodious, sad and earnest. It seems like the dirge of national degradation, the wail of a race, stricken and crushed, familiar with tyranny, submission and unrequited labor… And here I cannot help noticing the similarity existing between the working chorus of the sailors and the dirge-like negro melody, to which my attention was specially directed by an incident I witnessed or rather heard.|$|E

25|$|The descendents build private altars, {{containing}} the favorite foods and beverages, {{as well as}} photos and memorabilia, of the departed.

25|$|The Chapel of Reconciliation is {{somewhat}} unusual in that no masses or other services take place there; instead it is given over {{entirely to the}} Sacrament of Reconciliation. Priests from different countries observe a duty roster, which means that, at almost any time of day, pilgrims from Europe (and occasionally further away) can find a priest who <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> their confession in their own language.|$|E
25|$|Generally in February {{through to}} April, a parade and concert series {{inspired}} by New Orleans' Fat Tuesday party is held within Universal Studios Florida. The event features merchandise {{especially for the}} celebration and is held usually on Friday and Saturday nights. Every event night guests <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> some of Louisiana's bands performing blues, and Zydeco. An after party occurs in the French Quarter at Universal CityWalk. It is included with park admission.|$|E

25|$|People go to cemeteries to be {{with the}} souls of the {{departed}} and build private altars containing the favorite foods and beverages, as well as photos and memorabilia, of the departed. The intent is to encourage visits by the souls, so the souls <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> the prayers and the comments of the living directed to them. Celebrations can take a humorous tone, as celebrants remember funny events and anecdotes about the departed.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{interesting}} {{to pay attention}} to homilies from the doctrinal point of view and with the “gift of tongues”. For many faithful, the Sunday Holy Mass, with its Homily, is the only occasion where they <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> the message of Christ. With evermore renewed commitment, preaching will be very effective, above all if it is directed also at one’s own soul: if one lives what one says and preaches what one lives.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Magnétophone's {{recorded}} output, {{the listener}} <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> sonic experimentation {{in the form}} of mis-firing beats, sliding time frames, processed acoustic field recordings, minute background 'happenings' and synthesis manipulation and these are generally presented in 'alternative' song structures. However, their most recent LP 'The Man Who Ate The Man' exhibits the sonic exploration of their early work, whilst also employing traditional acoustic instruments including guitar, drums and melodica, Anglo-folk vocal lines and song structures approaching the 'conventional'.|$|E

25|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} are {{the most}} prevalent type of hallucinations. They include hearing voices and music. Many times an individual suffering from auditory hallucinations <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> a voice or voices saying the individual's own thoughts out loud, commenting on all their actions, or commanding and ordering the individual around. These voices tend to be negative and critical toward the individual. People who suffer from schizophrenia and have auditory hallucinations will often speak to the voice {{as though they are}} speaking to a second person.|$|E
25|$|His name is Wilbur C. Henderson, {{and he is}} {{investigating}} Grandpa for his evasion of income tax. When Henderson asks Grandpa why he owed twenty-four years of back income tax, Grandpa states he never believed in it, {{and that the government}} wouldn't {{know what to do with}} the money if he did pay it. Henderson becomes infuriated by Grandpa's answers to his questions. Henderson spots Grandpa's snakes, and runs out of the house in fear, but not before promising Grandpa that he <b>will</b> <b>hear,</b> one way or another, from the United States government.|$|E
25|$|On 2 November 2004 the Council {{adopted a}} {{decision}} establishing the European Union Civil Service Tribunal. This new specialised tribunal, composed of seven judges, <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> and determine {{at first instance}} disputes involving the European Civil Service. Its decisions {{will be subject to}} a right of appeal before the General Court on points of law only. Decisions given by the General Court in this area may exceptionally be subject to review by the Court of Justice. The European Union Civil Service Tribunal was duly constituted into law on 2 December 2005.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, Richard North filed a {{complaint}} of discrimination with the Manitoba Human Rights Commission when the Government of Manitoba again refused to register his marriage to Chris Vogel in the Unitarian Church. The Commission has referred this case to an adjudicator who <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> and decide the complaint in November 2017. The marriage certificate issued {{to them by the}} Unitarian Church in 1974 is now on display at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. A portrait of Vogel and North, by artist Rosey Goodman, is held by the Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives in its National Portrait Collection.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide variety}} of wild animals and birds have been {{observed}} in the area. The ones you might see when rambling around the countryside are wild boar, deer, foxes, hares and rabbits. The birds in your garden will include sparrows, swallows, starlings, crows, rooks, magpies, pigeons, finches and robins {{and you may be}} lucky enough to see flocks of migrating wild geese flying by. In the forest, you <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> - and sometimes see - owls and woodpeckers. Some species have suffered from hunting in recent years but there are now considerable efforts to protect flora and fauna. An area of the commune's forest is now a nature reserve.|$|E
25|$|A {{major part}} of the {{gameplay}} in Ties That Bind, as in the original game, concerns Torque's morality. At numerous points during the game, the player will encounter situations where they have several choices as to how to proceed. These situations often involve NPCs, and the choices are usually to help the person (good morality), kill them (bad morality), or ignore them (neutral morality). In many situations, when Torque first encounters an NPC, the player <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> the voice of Torque's dead wife urging him to help them, and almost immediately afterwards <b>will</b> <b>hear</b> the voice of Blackmore, the game's antagonist, urging him to kill them. Over the course of the game, the decisions made concerning Torque's morality cumulate, and the player will get one of three endings based on Torque's final morality level. How Torque's actions affect his morality is usually indicated by the reaction of his wife, who will praise him if he commits a good act, and Blackmore, who will praise him if he does something evil. The player can get a rough idea of Torque's morality level by both his own physical appearance (he will begin to look less and less human the more evil acts he commits) and by looking at a family photograph which he carries with him at all times; the cleaner the photo, the purer his morality. If the photo is dirty, crumpled and covered in blood, his morality is moving towards evil. There is also a morality gauge in the menu, which shows exactly where Torque's morality is currently positioned.|$|E
