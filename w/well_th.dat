Indeed, the fractures in the Sauerlach <b>wells</b> <b>Th</b> 2 and Th 3 show this orientation (Figure  5 b/c). Sauerlach Th 1, by contrast, is oriented between two terminating normal faults and shows a unimodal fracture set distribution between N 350 ° and 10 °E (Figure  5 a), although fractures oriented towards the WSW-ENE would be partly affected by observation bias.|$|R

40|$|Dynamical {{supersymmetry}} breaking is {{a fascinating}} theoretical problem. It is also of phenomenological significance. A better understanding of this phenomenon can help in model building, {{which in turn is}} useful in guiding the search for supersymmetry. In this article, we review the recent developments in the field. We discuss a few examples, which allow us to illustrate the main ideas in the subject. In the process, we also show how the techniques of holomorphy and duality come into play. Towards the end we indicate how these developments have helped in the study of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking. The review is intended for someone with a prior knowledge of supersymmetry who wants to find out about the recent progress in this field. 1 Introduction. Supersymmetry is a beautiful idea in theoretical physics. Unlike any conventional symmetry, it relates bosons and fermions.

40|$|We use {{new models}} of stellar {{population}} synthesis {{to estimate the}} fraction of stars formed during the last major bursts of star formation in E/S 0 galaxies in low-redshift clusters (z ∼ < 0. 4) from the spectral signatures of intermediate-age stars. We find that the mass fraction of stars formed in late bursts in early-type galaxies in clusters must have decreased smoothly with redshift, from about 8 % at z ≈ 1 to less than 1 % at z ≈ 0. This result, which we interpret as a constraint on stellar mass added in mergers, is nearly independent of the assumed ages and morphological types of the progenitor galaxies prior to the last major bursts of star formation. We then compute the implied color and 4000 ˚A break evolution for progenitors of E/S 0 galaxies in clusters at redshifts 0 ∼ < z ∼ < 1.

A similar test {{could be applied}} to hydrogen-fueled vehicles. It would test a realistic vehicle with its complete fuel and safety systems. An advantage of such a test is that the same test could be applied independent of the hydrogen storage technology (compressed gas, liquid, or hydride).

The tank must either survive or safely vent its contents. No modern composite wound tank is expected to survive for 20 minutes – so this is not a tank test but really a PRD test.

40|$|In {{the fall}} of 2013, the Electrical Engineering {{department}} at the University of Minnesota Duluth reconfigured its microcontroller instructional laboratory to use the AVR ATmega 32 microcontroller from Atmel for the first time. This change was prompted by pressure from students, who displayed considerable interest in the AVR family of processors due to its use in popular Arduino microcomputer systems. In response to this expressed interest from students, the microcontroller lab was redesigned around this new processor. Atmel’s ATmega 32 is an 8 -bit RISC processor, based on Harvard architecture. This new hardware replaced systems using Freescale’s S 12 processor, which is a 16 -bit CISC processor, based on Princeton architecture. Thus, this change was a fundamental shift on at least three axes of computer characteristics. Was this change a gain or a loss on each of those three axes? Experience this year with teaching the lab using the ATmega 32 has been generally positive, and this paper reports that experience in making the switch from the S 12 to the ATmega 32.
