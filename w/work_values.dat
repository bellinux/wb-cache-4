The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the moderating effect of a personal resource (i. e. intrinsic <b>work</b> <b>value</b> orientation) on the relationships between job demands, job resources, and job satisfaction among a large sample of Chinese employees from both mainland China and Taiwan. Design/methodology/approach – Structured questionnaire survey was carried out to collect data from 402 employees in mainland China and 306 employees in Taiwan. Findings – The authors found that intrinsic <b>work</b> <b>value</b> orientation amplified the negative relationship between work constraints (a job demand) and job satisfaction. Meanwhile, intrinsic <b>work</b> <b>value</b> orientation strengthened the positive relationship between autonomy (a job resource) and job satisfaction.

50|$|A {{quick note}} to mention {{is the work}} {{corresponding}} to the hysteresis in the force profile (Figure 2) does not correlate to the bond energy. The work done in retracting the tip is , approximated due to the linear behavior of deformation with Fmax being the force and Δx being the displacement immediately before release. Using the results of Frisbie et al., normalized to the estimated 50 functional groups in contact, the <b>work</b> <b>values</b> are estimated as 39 eV, 0.25 eV, and 4.3 eV for COOH/COOH, COOH/CH3, and CH3/CH3 interactions, respectively. Roughly, intermolecular bond energies can be calculated by: Ebond=kTB, TB being the boiling point. According to this, Ebond = 32.5 meV for formic acid, HCOOH, and 9.73 meV for methane, CH4, each value being about 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the experiment might suggest. Even if surface passivation with EtOH were considered (discussed below), the large error seems irrecoverable. The strongest hydrogen bonds are at most ~1 eV in energy. This strongly implies that the cantilever has a force constant smaller than or {{on the order of}} that for bond interactions and, therefore, it cannot be treated as perfectly rigid. This does open an avenue for increasing the usefulness of CFM if stiffer cantilevers can be used while still maintaining force resolution.|$|E

The effects of <b>work</b> <b>values</b> on work-related behaviour have received much less attention. The body of research in this book therefore focuses on exploring the relationship between <b>work</b> <b>values</b> and labour market behaviour.
