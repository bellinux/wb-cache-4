5|$|A {{few months}} later, in June 1919, the American Federation of Labor (AFL), {{responding}} to repeated requests from local police organizations, began accepting police organizations into their membership. By September, it had granted charters to police unions in 37 cities, including Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Miami, and St. Paul, though not without protests from some city officials, <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> unionization of police, firefighters, and teachers.|$|E
5|$|Another {{large group}} of victims was {{composed}} of German and foreign civilian activists {{across the political spectrum}} <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> Nazi regime, captured resistance fighters (many of whom were executed during—or immediately after—their interrogation, particularly in occupied Poland and France) and, sometimes, their families. German political prisoners were a substantial proportion of the first inmates at Dachau (the prototypical Nazi concentration camp). The political People's Court was notorious for the number of its death sentences.|$|E

Memorias was dedicated to Fernando Cuadrado, <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> monopoly.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, after Hastert had {{departed}} from Congress, the highway project was killed after federal regulators retracted the 2008 approval {{of an environmental}} impact statement for the project and agreed to an Illinois Department of Transportation request to redirect the funds for other projects. Environmentalists, <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> project, celebrated its cancellation.|$|E
5|$|Once more {{in nearly}} a two to one margin, the gay rights {{ordinance}} was defeated in Eugene. A poll taken after the vote showed that liberal voters who were not gay simply declined {{to show up and}} vote, and those <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> ordinance were much more motivated.|$|E
5|$|Popular {{heroes and}} leaders of the Greek Revolution, such as Generals Theodoros Kolokotronis and Yiannis Makriyiannis, <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> Bavarian-dominated regency, were charged with treason, put in jail and sentenced to death. They were later pardoned under popular pressure, while Greek judges who {{resisted}} Bavarian pressure and refused to sign the death warrants (Anastasios Polyzoidis and Georgios Tertsetis, for instance), were saluted as heroes.|$|E

5|$|The National Reorganization Process {{dictatorship}} {{came to an}} end in 1983, when Raúl Alfonsín won the 1983 elections. Rodríguez Saá became {{governor of}} San Luis in those elections, in a close contest with the Radical Civic Union. He was helped by the clergy of the province, <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> radical candidate because of his secularism.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish anarcho-syndicalists, <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> war out of doctrinaire {{cynicism and}} a belief that neither faction were on the workers' side, angrily repudiated their former idols (including Kropotkin, Malato and Grave) after {{discovering}} they had authored the manifesto. A small number of anarchists in Galicia and Asturias dissented and were heatedly denounced {{by the majority of}} Catalan anarcho-syndicalists (who prevailed in the anarchist union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo).|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} seen by 7.87 million {{following}} its broadcast on BBC One, however, despite the measures used to provide the balanced view, it was met with considerable controversy from Muslims, among them the Muslim Council of Britain, for fear that the episode would incite Islamophobia. Nearly a thousand complaints were made, although cast and crew members argued that the Muslims <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> episode {{did not understand the}} context.|$|E

5|$|The federal Conservatives {{proposed}} {{remedial legislation}} to override Manitoba, {{but they were}} blocked by the Liberals, led by Wilfrid Laurier, <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> remedial legislation because of his belief in provincial rights. Once elected Prime Minister in 1896, Laurier implemented a compromise stating Catholics in Manitoba could have their own religious instruction for 30 minutes {{at the end of}} the day if there were enough students to warrant it, implemented on a school-by-school basis.|$|E
5|$|An {{opposition}} {{group known}} as the Club emerged led by Sir James Montgomery, previously one of William's chief supporters but angered by Melville being preferred to him as Secretary of State. While the Club included a handful of Jacobites, it largely consisted of Episcopalians and dissident Presbyterians <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> Melville/Stair administration, not William himself. In July 1689, William agreed to end Episcopacy since nearly 200 Episcopalian clergy had already been evicted, a policy strongly supported by the Presbyterian majority in Parliament. He continued to resist abolition of the Committee of the Articles before government defeat at the Battle of Killiecrankie led to Parliament being suspended on 2nd August.|$|E
5|$|In 1639 William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal, {{came out}} {{in support of the}} Covenanters, a Presbyterian {{movement}} <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> established Episcopal Church and the changes which Charles I was attempting to impose. With James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, he marched against the Catholic James Gordon, 2nd Viscount Aboyne, Earl of Huntly, and defeated an attempt by the Royalists to seize Stonehaven. However, when Montrose changed sides to the Royalists and marched north, Marischal remained in Dunnottar, even when given command of the area by Parliament, and even when Montrose burned Stonehaven.|$|E

5|$|King Edward died in 1553, {{followed}} by the accession of Mary I of England, <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> Protestant reformers. Vermigli was placed under house arrest for six months, and his Catholic opponents at Oxford would likely have had him executed, as Cranmer eventually was in 1556. Despite this risk, he agreed to a public disputation with Cranmer against the new Catholic establishment, but this never came to fruition because Cranmer was imprisoned. Vermigli was able to receive permission from the Privy Council to leave England, and was advised by Cranmer to do so.|$|E
5|$|Nigel died on 30 May 1169. In either 1164 or in 1166, or {{possibly}} both, {{he had been}} struck by paralysis, and after this {{he seems to have}} withdrawn from active affairs. He took little part in the disputes between the king and Thomas Becket, although he did agree with his fellow bishops <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> king's attempt to reduce clerical benefits. He may have been buried at Ely, where a 12th-century marble slab possibly marks his tomb.|$|E
5|$|When Abdul Hamid II {{was overthrown}} during the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, 'Ata lost his favor {{from the central}} {{authorities}} because of his closeness with the deposed sultan and criticized the revolutionary officers. Consequently, the al-Bakri family realigned itself with Arab nationalists in Syria <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> increased Turkish nationalist efforts in the Arabic-speaking territories of the empire. 'Ata had also developed close ties with the Hashemites of the Hejaz. In 1909 he hosted the Sharif of Mecca, Hussein bin Ali, his brother Nasir, and Abdullah, Sharif Hussein's son, in his Damascus home.|$|E

5|$|While Lafayette was {{returning}} to France, LouisXVIII died, and CharlesX took the throne. As king, Charles intended to restore the absolute rule of the monarch, and his decrees had already prompted protest by the time Lafayette arrived. Lafayette was {{the most prominent of}} those <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> king. In the elections of 1827, the 70-year-old Lafayette was elected to the Chamber of Deputies again. Unhappy at the outcome, Charles dissolved the Chamber, and ordered a new election: Lafayette again won his seat.|$|E
5|$|According to American {{psychiatrist}} Oleg Lapshin, Russia until 1993 did {{not have}} any specific legislation in the field of mental health except uncoordinated instructions and articles of laws in criminal and administrative law, orders of the USSR Ministry of Health. In the Soviet Union, any psychiatric patient could be hospitalized by request of his headman, relatives or instructions of a district psychiatrist. In this case, patient's consent or dissent mattered nothing. The duration of treatment in a psychiatric hospital also depended entirely on the psychiatrist. All of that made the abuse of psychiatry possible to suppress those <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> political regime, and that created the vicious practice of ignoring the rights of the mentally ill.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitism {{was common}} in Germany and {{throughout}} Europe during this period, and Manstein's {{attitude towards the}} Jews had its roots in his exposure to and assimilation of these views. His actions were a reflection of his loyalty toward Hitler and the Nazi regime and of his grounding {{in a sense of}} duty based on traditional Prussian military values. His criticism of Hitler was based solely on their disagreements over the conduct of the war, not about the regime's racial policies. Some historians, including Antony Beevor and Benoît Lemay, are of the opinion that Manstein had some Jewish ancestry. Manstein was the only Reichswehr officer <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> <b>the</b> introduction of the Aryan paragraph in 1934. He sent a letter of protest to General Beck, commenting that anyone who had volunteered to serve in the armed forces had already proven their worth.|$|E
