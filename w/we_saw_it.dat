Following their 11 May concert at Rainbow Music Hall in Denver, concert {{promoter}} Chuck Morris took the band to the nearby Red Rocks Amphitheatre—a natural amphitheatre located between sandstone cliffs in the Rocky Mountains. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "From the moment <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> we were thinking, 'Some day we will play here'. It was very photogenic." [...] U2's manager Paul McGuinness had long wanted to film the group for a concert video to highlight their success as a live act and to promote them to American audiences still unfamiliar with the Irish band. Concert promoter Barry Fey, who presented U2's shows in the southwestern United States, saw the group's potential and successfully lobbied for them to perform at Red Rocks.|$|E

[...] Sachi Sri Kantha felt that the Gevacolor looked somewhat [...] "washed out" [...] and [...] "inferior" [...] to other colouring processes like Eastmancolor and versions of Fujicolor. He said the film succeeded with the Tamil masses because [...] "it was a first time experience they could enjoy the [...] in totality. This is because illiterate Tamil masses would have watched Hollywood movies produced in [...] for entertainment. But, being illiterate, [...] majority wouldn't have comprehended the dialogues and songs in English." [...] In 2015, Karan Bali wrote for Scroll.in that the film [...] "blended melodious songs, exciting fighting scenes and a suspenseful climax", and praised Veerappa's performance as Abu Hussain. On Ramachandran's centenary in January 2017, Nivedita Mishra of Hindustan Times included his performance in Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum in her list compiling [...] "some of his most memorable performances".|$|E

500|$|The halftime show {{received}} critical acclaim. Said Marc Schneider of Billboard: [...] "It's Madonna Louise Ciccone's world, we're just {{living in}} it". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times wrote {{that although the}} choice of Madonna as halftime-show performer was a subject of discussion, the singer was [...] "defiantly unconcerned with the more conservative red state wing of the football fanbase who'd never be caught dead singing along {{to one of her}} songs ... and her halftime show was pure spectacle by the Cleopatra of the game ... Madonna is Madonna for a reason. And <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> firsthand Sunday." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot called the show an [...] "S party to Ancient Egypt". Along with reminding the audience of her older hits, Madonna had [...] "important career-advancing work to do ... after all, never does anything unless she's got something to sell, and with a new studio album due out in March and a tour to follow, she had plenty on her to-do list". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that although the singer was not as [...] "indefatigable" [...] as she had been, she was a [...] "party girl turned regent: a queen on her throne, a homecoming queen strutting in the bleachers, a church singer fronting a choir". Pareles called Madonna [...] "grown-up", and wrote that she put on a show appropriate for the NFL. Peter Robinson of The Guardian called the performance low-key for the singer, despite the large audience. Robinson wrote that the show's budget would [...] " [...] your average James Cameron effort look like Homes Under the Hammer", and called Madonna's entrance and exit his favorite parts of the show.|$|E
500|$|In {{a conference}} call with Billboard, Carey {{revealed}} that she wrote [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] while her husband, Nick Cannon, was hospitalized receiving medical treatment for mild kidney failure, saying [...] "There's a lot of things you can take from there that can keep you going in a tough situation." [...] Carey also added that the song was written around the time her friend, singer Whitney Houston, had died. [...] "'We were actually in the hospital together when <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> on TV.' It was important for me to write something that would...help me get through the moment. That’s where ‘Stay triumphant, keep on living’ came from." [...] Carey also expressed why she chosen Ross and Mill, or any hip-hop artist in general on the track, claiming that they are [...] "different" [...] and how she is always experimenting on collaborations with varying and new artists. When asked why she chose not to release a lead single which was dance influenced, Carey explained how she felt regarding the current music scene; [...] "I think it would be incredible if we could bring back the days when R records didn't have to cross over but be massive hits on their own," [...] and that was the reason why {{she did not want to}} conform to what is currently on trend. Additionally, she felt that [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)", potentially, would be able to generate cross-appeal, and not only cater Mainstream Top 40. With specific emphasis on the dance music scene and its popularity, Carey stated that while she was pregnant, the vast majority of music that was being released was dance and electronic music, saying [...] "I was pregnant forever, and I was being tortured day and night by techno music. I was complaining to everyone who was listening. One time I made dinner for L.A. Reid, and we were both sitting there like 'What happened?

2500|$|Martyn, who was {{involved}} with Doon for several decades and became its second headmaster, acknowledged {{the influence of the}} very remarkable German man, Kurt Hahn, {{in the development of the}} school's ethos. Although Martyn had not visited India before, he immediately accepted Foot's offer because of the opportunity it afforded to implement Hahn's ideas, which he had not been able to do at Harrow. Martyn acknowledged Foot's leadership in the development of the school, but added that they both had similar ideas: [...] "I would not have been as bold as he was in trying to eliminate punishments, but we were equally keen on providing as wide a range as possible of activities that were creative and challenging... The problem, as <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> was to create an atmosphere in which boys would learn the importance of public spirit at the same time as they acquired self-confidence and initiative." ...|$|E

[...] "Then within three or four minutes I heard a loud explosion". Another said that [...] "it was raining. I saw the plane flying very low from the window of my office". Imran Abbasi told The New York Times that he [...] "could tell it was trouble because it stayed so low even though the mountains were up ahead". He stated that the jet was [...] "flying as low as a four-story building". It was reported that Abbasi said that [...] "as the aircraft started to turn, the right side of its front banged into the highest mountain, emitting an instant billow of blue fire and black smoke".|$|E
2500|$|There was {{considerable}} negative {{reaction to the}} characters Mudflap and Skids, who some perceived as embodying racist stereotypes. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that [...] "the characters [...] indicate that minstrelsy remains as much in fashion in Hollywood as when, well, Jar Jar Binks was set loose by George Lucas". Critic Scott Mendelson said [...] "To say that these two are the most astonishingly racist caricatures that I've ever seen in a mainstream motion picture would be an understatement." [...] Harry Knowles, founder of Ain't It Cool News, went further, asking his readers [...] "not to support this film" [...] because [...] "you'll be taking [...] to see a film with the lowest forms of humor, stereotypes, and racism around." [...] Bay (the director) has attempted to defend the film as [...] "good clean fun" [...] and insisted that [...] "We're just putting more personality in." [...] Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman responded to the controversy with [...] "It's really {{hard for us to}} sit here and try to justify it. I think that would be very foolish, and if someone wants to be offended by it, it's their right. We were very surprised when <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> too, and it's a choice that was made.

2500|$|Film critic Scott Mendelson, {{writing in}} The Huffington Post, cited Scully {{as an example}} of strong female {{characters}} on television, calling her [...] "one of the most iconic characters in the science-fiction genre". Radio Times Laura Pledger also named her as a strong TV woman, placing her at #1. Rebecca Traister of Salon.com opined that Scully had a better character arc than Mulder. She wrote, [...] "The very fact that her character was such a hard sell made her repeated brushes with the supernatural all the more powerful. Mulder's desire to believe was so expansive, his credulity so flexible, that it's not as though he was ever going to have either shaken from him. But Scully's surety was solid, stable, rigid; every time she saw something she thought she'd never see, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> crack, sparks fly from it. She was forced to question herself, grow, change". She praised her for being more [...] "rational, resilient, [...] mature" [...] than her partner and for their mature relationship. In a review of [...] "Irresistible", Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that it was a cliché to put Scully in danger, as [...] "Scully is [...] heart, and any time she's in danger, it feels like the show itself is about to be stabbed through the heart".|$|E
