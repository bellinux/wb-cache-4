5|$|Przemysł II {{was born}} on 14 October 1257 in Poznań as the fifth child and only son of Duke Przemysł I of Greater Poland and his wife Elisabeth, {{daughter}} of Duke Henry II the Pious of Silesia. It is known that {{he was born in}} the morning, because according to the Chronicle of Greater Poland, when Dowager Duchess Elisabeth gave birth to a son, the vicars and canons of the city <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> morning prayers. At the news of the birth, the local clergy chanted the Te Deum laudamus. Shortly after his birth, the prince was baptized by the Bishop of Poznań, Bogufał III.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} {{composed}} by Erwin Gutawa, {{who had previously}} collaborated with Chrisye on five albums. In an interview with The Jakarta Post, {{he said that he}} felt guilty as he had never written anything for Chrisye in the time they had worked together; he had intended to make a new song with Chrisye's voice since soon after the latter's death. The lyrics were written by Gutawa's daughter, Gita, who was asked by her father to write as if Chrisye <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> about having died, but his songs living on. Gita, who also sang at the concert, felt she owed something to Chrisye as her first stage performance was at his 2003 Dekade concert.|$|E
5|$|When he was fifteen, Vainio {{felt sure}} he would become a writer. As a young man he read a book about poetics, and later said that the rules were easy to break once he had learned them. It became {{apparent}} in essays written whilst at the gymnasium that Juha had talent as a writer. However, teachers sometimes had mixed feelings about his writing; at one time he received no grade for a lighthearted column-like text he had written, because the teacher felt {{that it could not}} be graded as an essay. Although essays were his strong point, school was uninteresting for Juha. He considered quitting school, but the principal persuaded him to change his mind. He was transferred to another school and was later joined there by his friend Risto Warjus. In the end, the only school subjects in which Vainio excelled <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> and sports.|$|E

25|$|It was at Rome, on the 15th of October, 1764, as I sat musing {{amidst the}} ruins of the Capitol, while the bare-footed friars <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> vespers in the temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first started to my mind.|$|E
25|$|On 17 October 2010, in a Serie A {{game against}} Cagliari, after just three minutes of play, the referee halted the match {{to give a}} warning to some Cagliari fans who <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> racist chants towards Eto'o. After play was resumed, {{the rest of the}} stadium chanted loudly in an attempt to drown out the racist chants {{in order to avoid the}} match being suspended. Inter went on to win 1–0 with an Eto'o goal in the 39th minute.|$|E
25|$|Levels of FOXP2 {{in adult}} zebra finches are {{significantly}} higher when males direct their song to females {{than when they}} sing song in other contexts. “Directed” singing refers to when a male is singing to a female usually for a courtship display. “Undirected” singing occurs when for example, a male sings when other males are present or is alone. Studies have found that FoxP2 levels {{vary depending on the}} social context. When the birds <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> undirected song, there was a decrease in of FoxP2 expression in Area X. This downregulation was not observed and FoxP2 levels remained stable in birds singing directed song.|$|E
5000|$|The Idolmaster SP {{features}} 34 {{songs in}} original versions and 20 remixes of those songs, {{for a total}} of 54 songs written and composed by a variety of songwriters. Initially, the three versions each contain 20 songs, though 17 of them are common to each version. The remaining three songs in each version can only initially <b>be</b> <b>sung</b> by one idol.

25|$|The {{passengers}} were saved by Republican Coast Guard boats and seaplanes, {{as well as}} the local fishermen who rushed to the scene. The President of Catalonia, Lluis Companys, came from Barcelona to observe the life saving efforts. The victims were hospitalized, some to the town of Calella and others to Barcelona. The surviving volunteers were transported to Barcelona were they soon joined the International Brigades. Only one decided to leave back home. One of the survivors was the Finnish American newspaperman Hjalmar Sankari (died March 1938 in the Aragon Retreats), an editor of the New York daily Eteenpäin, who wrote an article to his newspaper of the incident. According to Sankari, some of the volunteers <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> the Internationale while they were drowning with the ship.|$|E
25|$|Point of Grace {{was formed}} at Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas. Denise Masters, Terry Lang and Heather Floyd, who {{knew each other}} from Norman, Oklahoma, coincidentally found {{themselves}} at OBU, and got involved in music. They sang in a vocal group called 'The Ouachitones,' which {{was made up of}} 14 girls. Within the group, the girls formed a trio, and after a sound check for an Ouachitones performance, the girls <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> a cappella when they were told by an onlooker that they should do something together. Shelley Phillips had come from Little Rock, Arkansas to OBU with a scholarship in vocal performance. She sang in a group called the Praise Singers, made up of four girls and four guys and they traveled around the country performing concerts. She became friends with Terry and Heather through Denise, who was her roommate and sister in the social club Chi Delta. After Heather, Terry and Denise made plans to form a trio and sing together over the summer, Denise went back to her dorm room and told Shelley about their summer plans. After Shelley suggested that the trio became a quartet, it seemed to be the perfect fit.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, {{the band}} started {{performing}} at higher profile gigs {{such as the}} Warped Tour. Cuomo later remarked, [...] "We went in there fully expecting to be booed and to have things thrown at us. But it was exactly the opposite, people <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> along to all the songs and just going crazy, giving us the best support. And I think that gave us the confidence we needed." [...] The positive response to the Warped Tour performances led to further shows being scheduled. When touring began to wind down, MP3 demos captured live on the band's mobile unit and sound checks began to surface on file-sharing services and eventually for downloading on the band's official website. These songs were {{often referred to as}} Summer Songs of 2000 (commonly abbreviated as SS2K).|$|E

500|$|This {{aspect of}} the {{basement}} recordings became obvious when Dylan chose to record his next album, John Wesley Harding, in Nashville in late 1967. The songs on that record, according to Howard Sounes, revealed the influence of Dylan's daily reading of both the Bible and the Hank Williams songbook. And its sound {{came as a shock}} to other rock musicians. As producer Bob Johnston recalled, [...] "Every artist in the world was in the studio trying to make the biggest-sounding record they possibly could. So what does [...] do? He comes to Nashville and tells me he wants to record with a bass, drum and guitar." [...] Dylan summed up the gap: [...] "At that time psychedelic rock was overtaking the universe and we <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> these homespun ballads." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{considered}} the gig at Tokyo on 17 August {{to be the}} best of the tour. Glover remembered [...] "twelve or thirteen thousand Japanese kids <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> along to 'Child in Time'" [...] and considered it a career highlight, as did Gillan. At the venue, a row of bodyguards manned the front of the stage. When Blackmore smashed his guitar during the end of [...] "Space Truckin'" [...] and threw it into the audience, several of them clambered past fans to try and retrieve it. Blackmore was annoyed, {{but the rest of the}} band found the incident amusing. The gig was not as well recorded as the Osaka shows, though [...] "The Mule" [...] and [...] "Lazy" [...] were considered of sufficient quality to make the final release.|$|E
500|$|Tanner {{joined the}} Ted Weems band {{as a singer}} in 1929 and became a {{prominent}} feature of the group. Tanner's whistling talent was unveiled by accident. In high spirits {{on their way to}} their next performance, the band members <b>were</b> <b>singing,</b> yelling and whistling on the bus. [...] When Tanner joined in, Weems was impressed enough to add a whistling segment to one of the band's sets. [...] Tanner whistled the Show Boat song, [...] "Make Believe"; the audience asked for an encore. Tanner's whistling became so popular that Perry Como, another featured performer in the band, said “The whistler was the whole band.” [...] On occasion, Tanner’s lips would pucker up, interfering with his whistling. [...] Although generally noted for his graciousness as a bandleader, Weems would have fun at Tanner’s expense, running him through the most difficult songs in his repertoire when he noticed Tanner was struggling.|$|E

500|$|... "Under the Bridge" [...] was {{slightly}} altered because it contained personal lyrics by Anthony Kiedis, and the All Saints covered {{it because they}} liked the overall sound and feeling of the recording. The All Saints version contains samples of the original recording, {{the most important one}} being the distinctive guitar playing in the beginning. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were, however, displeased with this version; Kiedis felt the cover was poorly recreated and, with the omission of the final verse, which contains the line [...] "Under the bridge downtown / is where I drew some blood," [...] it lost all personal significance. He said of All Saints' version: [...] "It was kind of funny, they looked so pretty and clean, it looked like they didn't know what they <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> about." [...] The guitar on [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] was played by Richard Hawley. The original Japanese edition of the album version features a different, more R/pop version of the song.|$|E
500|$|Yiddish theatre {{composer}} Herman Yablokoff {{claimed in}} his biography, Memoirs of the Yiddish Stage, that the melody to [...] "Nature Boy" [...] was plagiarized from his song [...] "Shvayg mayn harts" [...] ("Hush My Heart"), {{which he wrote}} for his play Papirosn (1935). When met with a lawsuit in 1951 for the plagiarization, ahbez first proclaimed his innocence, and telephoned Yablokoff to explain that he [...] "had heard the melody as if angels <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> it... in the California mountains. He offered me $10,000 to withdraw the suit. I said that the money was not important, but I wanted him {{to admit that the}} song was geganvet and if he heard angels, they must have bought a copy of my song." [...] Eventually ahbez's lawyers offered to have an out-of-court settlement, offering $25,000 ($ in [...] dollars) to Yablokoff, which he accepted. Freidwald remarked that [...] "it struck no one as ironic that a song with message of love and peace should come to symbolize how cutthroat the pop music business was becoming".|$|E
500|$|In December 1986, Bono {{stated that}} he had a love–hate {{relationship}} with America, and that this influenced his work on the album. Speaking of his encounter with COMADRES in El Salvador and their impact on the song, he said, [...] "There's {{no question in my mind}} of the Reagan Administration's involvement in backing the regime that is committing these atrocities. I doubt if the people of America are even aware of this. It's not my position to lecture them or tell them their place or to even open their eyes up to it in a very visual way, but it is affecting me and it affects the words I write and the music we make." [...] In 2007, Clayton noted [...] "We were looking at this America through a European lens, at a time when Britain was under Margaret Thatcher who was breaking the miners.... So we <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> from the same hymn sheet as the Clash but with our spotlight focused on injustice inside and outside America." [...] He said [...] "'Mothers of the Disappeared' was not just a reflection on what had happened under the military government in Chile but also at the US which had supported that government", and described Bono's vocals as [...] "prehistoric", saying [...] "it connects with something very primitive." ...|$|E

Usually the slower paced songs <b>are</b> <b>sung</b> in the beginning and progressively faster songs <b>are</b> <b>sung</b> as the gourd dance progresses. When the gourd dance draws to a close, a fast song is usually the last to be performed, {{but it is not}} the [...] "official" [...] closing song.

500|$|During the follow pre-season, Holdsworth allowed Nix {{to attend}} a trial with Dutch Eerste Divisie side Sparta Rotterdam. Nix {{described}} it as a [...] "chance of a lifetime" [...] to pursue his dream of playing for the Australian national side with Sparta having an Australian coach. However, his trial was unsuccessful and he returned to Mansfield and he immediately scored in a friendly ahead of the new Conference season. Nix was not included in Mansfield's squad for the first three games of the season, and during the third match with the side losing, the club's fans <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> Nix's name. After eventually winning 3–1, Holdsworth said: [...] "I know Kyle is a very good player and I respect the fans have individuals they like. But we have a healthy squad here and I picked what I felt was a winning side today which proved to be right." [...] His first game of the season was as a late substitute for Adam Smith moments after Mansfield conceded an equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Kettering Town. His first start of the season came as Holdsworth made changes to personnel and formation for a game at Southport on 11 September. A 2–1 victory was Mansfield's third consecutive win. Before the end of the month, he had scored his first goal of the month, during a 5–0 victory against York City which put Mansfield second in the table.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the acclaim lavished on the song, some of Wilson's pop and rock contemporaries have been tempered in their praise of [...] "Good Vibrations". When asked about the song in 1990, Paul McCartney responded: [...] "I {{thought it was a}} great record. It didn't quite have the emotional thing that Pet Sounds had for me. I've often played Pet Sounds and cried. It's that kind of an album for me." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was quoted in the 1960s as saying, [...] "'Good Vibrations' was probably a good record but who's to know? You had to play it about 90 bloody times to even hear what they <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> about." [...] Townshend feared that the single would lead to a trend of overproduction. In a 1966 issue of Arts Magazine, Jonathan King said: [...] "With justification, comments are being passed that 'Good Vibrations' is an inhuman work of art. Computerized pop, mechanized music. Take a machine, feed in various musical instruments, add a catch phrase, stir well, and press seven buttons. It is long and split. ... impressive, fantastic, commercial—yes. Emotional, soul-destroying, shattering—no." [...] In the 2000s, record producer Phil Spector criticized the single for depending too much on tape manipulation, negatively referring to it as an [...] "edit record ... It's like Psycho is a great film, but it's an 'edit film.' Without edits, it's not a film; with edits, it's a great film. But it's not Rebecca ... it's not a beautiful story." ...|$|E
500|$|Jim DeRogatis of the Chicago Sun-Times criticized [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] as the [...] "most {{disturbing}} [...] of [...]" [...] Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun called [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] "an {{attempt at}} Gwen Stefani's new wave sound that doesn't work." [...] Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star called it [...] "awful," [...] along with [...] "My Baby", and a [...] "baby-talk horror." [...] Poppy Cosyns of The Sun criticized the song's lyrics, deeming it as [...] "bizarre lyrics which reference [...] love/hate father-daughter turmoil." [...] Pete Paphides of The Times said [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] "couldn't be less sexy if Christine Hamilton <b>were</b> <b>singing</b> them," [...] while a review by The Independent said the song portrays [...] "the former Mouseketeer {{as some kind}} of robotic nymphomaniac doll – groaning and grunting [...] "let's make out" [...] with the chilly distance of a future-sex cyborg unit." [...] Darryl Sterdan of Jam! gave [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] a positive review, saying, [...] "between the hip-swivelling groove, the twangy guitar, the surfy organ lines and the silly vocals, this might be the most enjoyable cut on the disc. Pure fun." [...] Despite not being released as a single, [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] did manage to peak at number ninety-four on Billboard Pop 100, on the week of December 10, 2008, due to moderate airplay on mainstream top 40 radio stations, singles sales, and digital downloads.|$|E
