25|$|One {{distinctive}} {{advantage of}} PID controllers is that two PID controllers {{can be used}} together to yield better dynamic performance. This is called cascaded PID control. In cascade control there are two PIDs arranged with one PID controlling the setpoint of another. A PID controller acts as outer loop controller, which controls the primary physical parameter, such as fluid level or velocity. The other controller acts as inner loop controller, which reads the output of outer loop controller as setpoint, usually controlling a more rapid changing parameter, flowrate or acceleration. It can be mathematically proven that the <b>working</b> <b>frequency</b> of the controller is increased and the time constant of the object is reduced by using cascaded PID controllers..|$|E

40|$|A dual-frequency {{patch antenna}} with {{monopolar}} radiation patterns at both <b>working</b> <b>frequencies</b> {{is presented in}} this paper. The antenna design {{is based on a}} conventional patch with two concentric short-circuited conditions with a separating gap between them. Both shorting conditions are implemented with vias between the patch and the ground plane.

These modes result in a monopolar radiation pattern at two different <b>frequencies.</b> The <b>working</b> <b>frequencies</b> can be arbitrary set and depend on the patch dimensions and the location of the shorting vias. Two feeding strategies have been studied: a single coaxial probe which excites both monopolar modes and a different coaxial probe for each mode.
