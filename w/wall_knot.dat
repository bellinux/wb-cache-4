I went several times to hear if Jacques had any news, and was glad when he told me that most of the troops were ordered to be under arms, at eight o'clock. This would make matters simpler for me for, with numbers of people going in and coming out of the castle, it would be easy to slip in unnoticed.|$|R
50|$|Ashley's stopper knot, {{also known}} as the oysterman's stopper, is a knot {{developed}} by Clifford W. Ashley around 1910. It makes a well-balanced trefoil-faced stopper {{at the end of the}} rope, giving greater resistance to pulling through an opening than other common stoppers. Essentially, the knot is a common overhand noose, but with the end of the rope passing through the noose eye, which closes upon it. It may be multiplied to form a larger knot with more than three bights appearing around the knot. It is the result of implementing a double <b>wall</b> <b>knot</b> in one strand.|$|E

40|$|When {{introduced}} into a novel environment, mammals establish in it a preferred place {{marked by the}} highest number of visits and highest cumulative time spent in it. Examination of exploratory behavior in reference to this "home base" highlights important features of its organization. It might therefore be fruitful to search for other types of marked places in mouse exploratory behavior and examine their influence on overall behavior. Examination of path curvatures of mice exploring a large empty arena revealed the presence of circumscribed locales marked by the performance of tortuous paths full of twists and turns. We term these places knots, and the behavior performed in them-knot-scribbling. There is typically no more than one knot per session; it has distinct boundaries and it is maintained both within and across sessions. Knots are mostly situated in the place of introduction into the arena, here away from <b>walls.</b> <b>Knots</b> are not characterized by the features of a home base, except for a high speed during inbound and a low speed during outbound paths. The establishment of knots is enhanced by injecting the mouse with saline and placing it in an exposed portion of the arena, suggesting that stress and the arousal associated with it consolidate a long-term contingency between a particular locale and knot-scribbling. In an environment devoid of proximal cues mice mark a locale associated with arousal by twisting and turning in it. This creates a self-generated, often centrally located landmark. The tortuosity of the path traced during the behavior implies almost concurrent multiple views of the environment. Knot-scribbling could therefore function as a way to obtain an overview of the entire environment, allowing re-calibration of the mouse's locale map and compass directions. The rich vestibular input generated by scribbling could improve the interpretation of the visual scene...|$|R

40|$|Euclidean d= 3 SU(2) Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons (YMCS) theory, {{including}} Georgi-Glashow (GGCS) theory, {{may have}} solitons {{in the presence}} of appropriate mass terms. For integral CS level k and for solitons carrying integral CS number, YMCS is gauge-invariant and consistent. However, individual solitons such as sphalerons and linked center vortices with CS number of 1 / 2 and writhing center vortices with arbitrary CS number are non-compact; a condensate of them threatens compactness of the theory. We study various forms of the non-compact theory in the dilute-gas approximation, treating the parameters of non-compact large gauge transformations as collective coordinates. We conclude: 1) YMCS theory dynamically compactifies; non-compact YMCS have infinitely higher vacuum energy than compact YMCS. 2) An odd number of sphalerons is associated with a domain- wall sphaleron, a pure-gauge configuration on a closed surface enclosing them and with a half-integral CS number. 3) We interpret the domain-wall sphaleron in terms of fictitious closed Abelian magnetic field lines that express the links of the Hopf fibration. Sphalerons are over- and under-crossings of knots in the field lines; the domain-wall sphaleron is a superconducting <b>wall</b> confining these <b>knots</b> to a compact domain. 4) Analogous results hold for center vortices and nexuses. 5) For a CS term induced with an odd number of fermion doublets, domain-wall sphalerons are related to non-normalizable fermion modes. 6) GGCS with monopoles is compactified with center-vortex-like strings.

40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 540 - 545 An {{automatic}} on-line pre-concentration {{system is}} proposed for lead determination {{in drinking water}} using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). Lead(II) ions are retained as the 1 -(2 -pyridylazo) - 2 -naphthol (PAN) complex in the <b>walls</b> of a <b>knotted</b> reactor, followed by an elution step using 0. 50 mol L− 1 hydrochloric acid solution. Optimisation involving the sampling flow rate, pH and buffer concentration factors was performed using a Box–Behnken design. Other factors were established considering results of previous experiments. The procedure allows the determination of lead with a 0. 43 μg L− 1 detection limit (3 σ/S) and precisions (expressed as relative standard deviation) of 4. 84 % (N = 7) and 2. 9 % (N = 7) for lead concentrations of 5 and 25 μg L− 1, respectively. The accuracy was confirmed by the determination of lead in the NIST SRM 1643 d trace elements in natural water standard reference material. The pre-concentration factor obtained is 26. 5 and the sampling frequency is 48 h− 1. The recovery achieved for lead determination {{in the presence of}} several ions demonstrated that this procedure could be applied to the analysis of drinking water samples. The method was applied for lead determination in drinking water samples collected in Jequié City, Brazil. The lead concentration found in 25 samples were always lower than the permissible maximum levels stipulated by World Health Organization...|$|R
