5|$|The {{adolescent}} Caligula {{was then}} sent {{to live with his}} great-grandmother (and Tiberius's mother) Livia. After her death, he was sent to live with his grandmother Antonia. In 30 AD, his brother, Drusus Caesar, was imprisoned on charges of treason and his brother Nero died in exile from either starvation or suicide. Suetonius writes that after the banishment of his mother and brothers, Caligula and his sisters <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> more than prisoners of Tiberius under the close watch of soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Prison officials, {{fed up with}} Stroud's {{activities}} and their attendant publicity, intensified their efforts to transfer him out of Leavenworth. Stroud, however, discovered a Kansas law that forbade the transfer of prisoners married in Kansas. To this end, he married Jones by proxy, which infuriated the prison's administrators, who would not allow him to correspond with his wife. Prison officials {{were not the only}} ones perturbed with Stroud's marriage; his mother was also incensed. They had a close relationship, but Elizabeth Stroud strongly disapproved of the marriage to Jones, believing women <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> but trouble for her son. Whereas previously she had been a strong advocate for her son, helping him with legal battles, she now argued against his application for parole, and became a major obstacle in his attempts to be released from the prison system. She moved away from Leavenworth and refused any further contact with him until her death in 1937.|$|E

25|$|As dance progressed {{into the}} 19th century, the {{emphasis}} on technical skill increased, as did the desire to dance en pointe {{without the aid of}} wires. When Marie Taglioni first danced La Sylphide en pointe, her shoes <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> more than modified satin slippers; the soles were made of leather and the sides and toes were darned to help the shoes hold their shapes. Because the shoes of this period offered no support, dancers would pad their toes for comfort and rely on the strength of their feet and ankles for support.|$|E

25|$|The above {{similarities}} {{have led}} scholars {{to ask what}} relationship did Brehons have with clerics. Some scholars, known as anti-nativists, {{have suggested that the}} Brehons <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> more than clerics who had training in secular law. In addition to the similarities and evidence of borrowing from Canon law and the Bible, scholars who hold this position ask how any non Clerics could have been sufficiently literate at this period to create the texts. Other scholars, known as nativists, have asked how the differences could arise if the authors of canon and secular law were indeed the same.|$|E
25|$|On May 8, Pavelić {{ordered that}} the columns from NDH {{continue}} to Austria, {{and that they}} refuse to surrender to the advancing Communists, instead planning to surrender to the British. However, they were instead turned back in the mid-May Bleiburg repatriations, and many were subsequently killed by the Partisans. The sheer number of civilians slowed down the retreat, made the surrender unfeasible to the Allies, and ultimately led {{to the belief that}} they <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a human shield to the Ustashe. For his abandonment of Croatian soldiers and civilians, later Croatian emigrants would accuse Pavelić of cowardice.|$|E
25|$|Early on, Andronikos ruled wisely – {{he began}} by attacking the {{corruption}} within the taxation and administration of the empire. Before long his heavy-handed ruling of the Empire gave rise to enemies in {{all corners of the}} Empire; the aristocrats in Anatolia were conspiring against his rule, Isaac Komnenos declared Cyprus an independent kingdom and Béla III of Hungary, formerly engaged to Maria Komnene, began sacking towns along Dalmatia and Croatia. However, these calamities <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> in comparison to the storm that had lain dormant, that some would argue was worse than the Turks of Manzikert – the Normans of the Kingdom of Sicily.|$|E

25|$|John Willis-Bund {{states that}} the battle of Camp Hill was {{remarkable}} {{from the fact that}} an armed mob—they <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> more—twice repulsed assaults of the best troops in the Royalist army, who attacked them in overwhelming numbers. That less than 300 men should keep some 1,800 at bay, even for a short time, was an act that deserved to be recorded; that they, an untrained mob, should have checked the dreaded Royalist cavalry, was a still greater achievement. The Parliamentarians were delighted, and they had reason to be. Captain Greaves, probably a local man, {{a member of the family}} that lived at King's Norton, who commanded the Parliament troops, might well be proud of his men's achievement.|$|E
25|$|In 1925, Imam Yahya {{captured}} al-Hudaydah {{from the}} Idrsids. He continued to follow and attack the Idrsids until Asir {{fell under the}} control of the imam's forces, forcing the Idrisi to request an agreement that would enable them to administer the region in the name of the imam. Imam Yahya refused the offer on the grounds that the Idrisis were of a Moroccan descent. According to Imam Yahya, the Idrisis, along with the British, <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> but recent intruders and should be driven out of Yemen permanently. In 1927, Imam Yahya's forces were 50km away from Aden, Taiz, and Ibb, and were bombed by the British for five days; the imam had to pull back. Small Bedouin forces, mainly from the Madh'hij confederation of Marib, attacked Shabwah but were bombed by the British and had to retreat.|$|E
25|$|According to Livy, writing {{five hundred}} years after the fact, Menenius was chosen by the patricians during the secession of the plebs in 494 BC to persuade the plebs to end their secession. Livy says that Menenius told the {{soldiers}} a fable about {{the parts of the}} human body and how each has its own purpose in the greater function of the body. The rest of the body thought the stomach was getting a free ride so the body decided to stop nourishing the stomach. Soon, the other parts became fatigued and unable to function so they realized that the stomach did serve a purpose and they <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> without it. In the story, the stomach represents the patrician class and the other body parts represent the plebs. Eventually, Livy says, an accord was reached between the patricians and the plebs, which included creating the office of tribune of the plebs.|$|E

25|$|At {{first the}} focal point of dissension was the Jesuit Ricci's {{contention}} that the ceremonial rites of Confucianism and ancestor veneration were primarily social and political in nature and could be practiced by converts. The Dominicans, however, charged that the practices were idolatrous, meaning that all acts of respect to the sage and one's ancestors <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> less than the worship of demons. A Dominican carried the case to Rome where it dragged on and on, largely because no one in the Vatican knew Chinese culture sufficiently to provide the pope with a ruling. Naturally, the Jesuits appealed to the Chinese emperor, who endorsed Ricci's position. Understandably, the emperor was confused as to why missionaries were attacking missionaries in his capital and asking him to choose one side over the other, when he might very well have simply ordered the expulsion of all of them.|$|E
25|$|French {{demands from}} the Duke <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> {{less than an}} attack on Savoyard independence, and the {{intimidation}} ultimately proved counter-productive. In the early summer of 1690 Amadeus realised he had {{to stand up to}} France and he began to look towards the Grand Alliance. But he had conditions. Amadeus reiterated his family claim to the Duchy of Montferrat, over which the House of Savoy was in perennial dispute with the Duke of Mantua, stipulating the razing of Casale as the minimum he would accept in this region; he also demanded the reacquisition of Pinerolo as {{the sine qua non of}} Savoyard entry into the war on the Allied side, and sought to take over at least one French place in Dauphiné. Amadeus's hectic preparations for war and his negotiations for financial assistance from England and Spain, were followed by a declaration of war against France on 4 June.|$|E
25|$|Ashoka, the {{grandson}} of Chandragupta, {{was one of the}} greatest Indian rulers. Like his grandfather, Ashoka also started his career in Gandhara as a governor. Later he supposedly became a Buddhist and promoted this religion in his empire. He built many stupas in Gandhara. Mauryan control over the northwestern frontier, including the Yonas, Kambojas, and the Gandharas, is attested from the Rock Edicts left by Ashoka. According to one school of scholars, the Gandharas and Kambojas were cognate people. It is also contended that the Kurus, Kambojas, Gandharas and Bahlikas were cognate people and all had Iranian affinities, or that the Gandhara and Kamboja <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> but two provinces of one empire and hence influencing each other's language. However, the local language of Gandhara is represented by Panini's conservative bhāṣā ("language"), which is entirely different from the Iranian (Late Avestan) language of the Kamboja that is indicated by Patanjali's quote of Kambojan śavati 'to go' (= Late Avestan šava(i)ti).|$|E
