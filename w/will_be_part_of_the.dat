A 2016 study by Travel Math had the New York City Subway listed as the dirtiest subway system in the country {{based on the number of}} viable bacteria cells. In August 2016, the MTA announced that it had initiated Operation Track Sweep, which is an aggressive plan that will dramatically reduce the amount of trash on the tracks and in the subway environment, and in turn should reduce track fires and train delays. The frequency of station track cleaning will be increased. In a two-week period, 94 stations will be cleaned, an increase from 34 stations. Starting on September 12, 2016, the MTA launched an intensive two-week, system-wide cleaning from all of the tracks at all of the system's stations. New portable track vacuum systems are in the works as the MTA is working with two manufacturers. Three new powerful vacuum trains, two arriving in 2017, and the third in 2018, and 27 new refuse cars <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> operation.|$|E
