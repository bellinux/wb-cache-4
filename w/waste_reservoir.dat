40|$|This paper {{presents}} new fabrication {{technologies and}} materials for microfluidic systems with reduced mass, volume, and power consumption. A general microfluidic platform consists of sample preparation, processing and detection. The system requires various fluidic components, e. g., reagent and <b>waste</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> micromixers, microreactors. To fabricate these different components, {{we have developed}} four new Parylene microfluidic technologies {{that are capable of}} fabricating various features whether they are small (microns), large (centimeters), long (meters), complex, 2 D, or 3 D. The first Parylene-D microfluidic components are demonstrated. The developed technologies are very promising for portable and in situ detection especially for space mission and field-deployable application...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{liquid flow}} control is {{important}} in most chemical analyses. In this work, measurement of liquid flow in microliters per minute was performed, and feedback control of the flow rate was examined. The flow sensor was arranged on a channel made in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) block. The center of the channel was cooled by a miniature Peltier device, and the change in temperature balance along the channel formed by the flow was measured by two temperature sensors. Using this flow sensor, feedback flow control was examined with two pumping methods. One was the electroosmotic flow method, made by applying high voltage (HV) between the reagent and <b>waste</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> {{and the other was}} the piezo valve method, in which a micro-valve-seat was fabricated in a PDMS cavity with a silicone diaphragm. The latter was adopted for a micro gas analysis system (mGAS) for the measurement of atmospheric H 2 S and SO 2. The obtained baselines were stable, and better limits of detection were obtained...|$|R

50|$|The Ajka alumina sludge spill was an {{industrial}} accident at a caustic <b>waste</b> <b>reservoir</b> chain of the Ajkai Timföldgyár alumina plant in Ajka, Veszprém County, in western Hungary. On 4 October 2010, at 12:25 CEST (10:25 UTC), the northwestern {{corner of the}} dam of reservoir no. 10 collapsed, freeing approximately one million cubic metres (35 million cubic feet) of liquid waste from red mud lakes. The mud was released as a 1 - 2 m wave, flooding several nearby localities, including the village of Kolontár {{and the town of}} Devecser. Ten people died, and 150 people were injured. About 40 km2 of land were initially affected. The spill reached the Danube on 7 October 2010.|$|E
50|$|The wash phase {{begins when}} the wash bowl is {{appropriately}} filled with red cells. The pump continues a counterclockwise rotation and clamps adjust, enabling {{the transfer of}} wash solution to the wash bowl. The washing phase removes cellular stromata, plasma free hemoglobin, anticoagulant solution, activated clotting factors, any plasma bound antibiotics, intracellular enzymes, plasma, platelets, and white cells. The unwanted fluid passes out of the wash bowl and into a <b>waste</b> <b>reservoir</b> bag. Washing continues until the reinfuse button is depressed (or the program ends, {{in the case of}} an automatic device) and the appropriate amount of wash solution has been delivered to the wash bowl. The wash phase is terminated when one to two liters of wash solution has been transferred, or the fluid transferred to the waste bag appears transparent (or both).|$|E

40|$|A new dual channel micro-electrophoresis {{system for}} rapid {{mutation}} detection based on heteroduplex analysis {{was designed and}} implemented. Mutation detection was successfully achieved in a total separation length of 250 [*]μm in less than 3 [*]min for a 590 [*]bp DNA sample harboring a 3 [*]bp mutation causing an amino acid change. Parylene-C {{was used as the}} structural material for fabricating the micro-channels as it provides conformal deposition, transparency, biocompatibility, and low background fluorescence without any surface treatment. A new dual channel architecture was derived from the traditional cross-channel layout by forming two identical channels with independent sample loading and <b>waste</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> The control of injected sample volume was accomplished by a new u-turn injection technique with pull-back method. The use of heteroduplex analysis as a mutation detection method on a cross-linked polyacrylamide medium provided accurate mutation detection in an extremely short length and time. The presence of two channels on the microchip offers the opportunity of comparing the sample to be tested with a desired control sample rapidly, which is very critical for the accuracy and reliability of the mutation analyses, especially for clinical and research purposes...|$|R
40|$|High {{throughput}} DNA sequencing {{has been}} performed {{by using a}} microfabricated 96 -channel radial capillary array electrophoresis (μCAE) microchannel plate detected by a 4 -color rotary confocal fluorescence scanner. The microchannel plate features a novel injector for uniform sieving matrix loading as well as high resolution, tapered turns that provide an effective separation length of 15. 9 cm on a compact 150 -mm diameter wafer. Expanded common buffer chambers for the cathode, anode, and <b>waste</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are used to simplify electrode addressing and to counteract buffering capacity depletion arising from the high electrophoretic current. DNA sequencing data from 95 successful lanes out of 96 lanes run in parallel were batch-processed with basefinder, producing an average read length of 430 bp (phred q ≥ 20). Phred quality values were found to exceed 40 (0. 01 % probability of incorrectly calling a base) for over 80 % of the read length. The μCAE system demonstrated here produces sequencing data {{at a rate of}} 1. 7 kbp/min, a 5 -fold increase over current commercial capillary array electrophoresis technology. Additionally, this system permits lower reagent volumes and lower sample concentrations, and it presents numerous possibilities for integrated sample preparation and handling. The unique capabilities of μCAE technology should make it the next generation, high performance DNA sequencing platform...|$|R
40|$|A {{rapid and}} variable-volume sample loading scheme for nonaqueous {{microchip}} electrophoresis with laser induced fluorescence detection (NAMCE-LIF) was developed, {{which included a}} porous polymer plug, a low-cost microvacuum pump, and a single potential supply. The porous polymer plug was fabricated within the separation channel as a select valve, which prevented the running buffer from buffer <b>waste</b> <b>reservoir</b> (BW) flowing back into the separation channel, but allowed electrophoretic migration along the separation channel. By applying a subatmospheric pressure to the headspace of sample <b>waste</b> <b>reservoir</b> (SW), sample and running buffer were drawn immediately to SW. At the same time, {{a branch of the}} sample stream was driven across the porous polymer plug by the electric force and formed a sample zone in the separation channel. The injected sample zone length was in proportion with the injection time. The proposed method was successfully applied to separation of Rhodamine 123 (Rh 123) and Rhodamine 6 G (Rh 6 G). The limits of detection for Rh 123 and Rh 6 G based on S/N = 3 were 0. 63 and 0. 48 nmol L- 1, respectively. The system has been proved to possess an exciting potential for improving throughput, repeatability, sensitivity, separation performance of nonaqueous microchip electrophoresis and a wide range of applications...|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{we propose}} a pillar-based {{microfluidic}} chip and system with machine-learning for T-cells and B-cells isolation and detection. The design of micropillar array with gradually narrowed gaps were optimized to trap leukocytes while allowing other blood cells to flow through [22]. The size and deformability-based separation of leukocytes require micropillar of proper gap size and precise control of pressure {{applied to the}} array. Under optimized conditions, a sub-microliter of whole blood was suspended in a buffer and then directly introduced to the micropillar array without pre-treatment such as density gradient or RBCs lysis. All leukocyte types were individually trapped between micropillars, while other elements of blood passed through the micropillar array into a <b>waste</b> <b>reservoir.</b> To detect T-cells and B-cells from fluorescence microscopy images, a machine learning method based on both HOG and color features was studied.|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{miniaturized}} human multi-micro-organ bioreactor {{systems are}} envisaged {{as a possible}} solution for the embarrassing gap of predictive substance testing prior to human exposure. A rational approach was applied to simulate and design dynamic long-term cultures of the smallest possible functional human organ units, human "micro-organoids", on a chip {{the shape of a}} microscope slide. Each chip contains six identical dynamic micro-bioreactors with three different micro-organoid culture segments each, a feed supply and <b>waste</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> A liver, a brain cortex and a bone marrow micro-organoid segment were designed into each bioreactor. This design was translated into a multi-layer chip prototype and a routine manufacturing procedure was established. The first series of microscopable, chemically resistant and sterilizable chip prototypes was tested for matrix compatibility and primary cell culture suitability. Sterility and long-term human cell survival could be shown. Optimizing the applied design approach and prototyping tools resulted in a time period of only 3 months for a single design and prototyping cycle. This rapid prototyping scheme now allows for fast adjustment or redesign of inaccurate architectures. The designed chip platform is thus ready to be evaluated for the establishment and maintenance of the human liver, brain cortex and bone marrow micro-organoids in a systemic microenvironment...|$|R

40|$|A novel sample {{injection}} method for chip CE was presented. This injection method uses hydrostatic pressure, generated by emptying the sample <b>waste</b> <b>reservoir,</b> for sample loading and electrokinetic force for dispensing. The injection {{was performed on}} a double-cross microchip. One cross, created by the sample and separation channels, is used for formation of a sample plug. Another cross, formed by the sample and controlling channels, is used for plug control. By varying the electric field in the controlling channel, the sample plug volume can be linearly adjusted. Hydrostatic pressure takes advantage of its ease of generation on a microfluidic chip, without any electrode or external pressure pump, thus allowing a {{sample injection}} with a minimum number of electrodes. The potential of this injection method was demonstrated by a four-separation-channel chip CE system. In this system, parallel sample separation can be achieved with only two electrodes, which is otherwise impossible with conventional injection methods. Hydrostatic pressure maintains the sample composition during the sample loading, allowing the injection {{to be free of}} injection bias...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for evaluating timber clearing {{as a means}} for beneficially increasing water yields from forested watersheds. Stochastic models of temperature and precipitation are developed and used to generate long term synthetic records of rain, snow, snowmelt, and potential evaporation. A deterministic hydrologic watershed model transforms the synthetic climatic data into long term streamflow records reflecting the hydrologic effects of clearing selected percentages of watershed area, either on a permanent or rotational basis. The simulated streamflow regimes are then analyzed in relation to the impacted reservoir and water supply system. Evaluation categories discussed include timber and forage production, agricultural water supply, flooding, hydroelectric power production, and reservoir-based recreation. A 38. 8 square mile watershed on the East Fork White River in east-central Arizona is used to illustrate the procedures developed in this study. Vegetation management alternatives modeled are permanent conversion of 0, 20, 33, 50, 67, and 100 percent of the watershed area, as well as periodic harvesting, with subsequent timber regrowth, of 20, 33, and 50 percent of the watershed area. A hypothetical reservoir system serves as the basis for evaluating a 250 year simulated streamflow record induced by each management option. All conversion activities result in increased streamflow, better ability to meet water demands, greater recreational activity, and more power production. However, potential for flood damage and <b>wasted</b> <b>reservoir</b> releases also increase. Depending on specific management objectives, the ultimate choice lies within the 20 to 50 percent range of permanent conversion activities...|$|R

Predominantly lead and zinc were mined, and the heyday of metal mining in the forest was between 1850 and 1919, although mining on a small scale began in the early 17th century. Indeed, whilst evidence is difficult to find following centuries of subsequent mining work, it is more than likely that a certain amount of shallow mining was undertaken by the Romans—the Roman road of Sarn Helen passed through the forest.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we show {{the design and}} {{characterization}} of a microfluidic cell sorter. The device is designed to sort small quantities of live cells labeled with either live dyes or Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Manually operated, it reaches frequencies of 10 cells per minute. Sorting occurs through hydrodynamic switching, with low hydrodynamic shear stresses, preserving to a high degree the pre-sorted cell status. Also, the cells are not subjected to any electric or magnetic field. The chip is made from reusable hard plastic material (PMMA) into which microchannels are directly milled with a hydraulic diameter of 70 μm, and one inlet and two outlet reservoirs are drilled through the chip. A syringe pump provides a sheath flow that deflects the cells into either the <b>waste</b> <b>reservoir</b> or collection reservoir, depending {{on the state of}} two fast solenoid valves. The cells are maintained in an isotonic buffer throughout the sorting process. The Peclet number in the channel is large, preventing diffusion of cells to the walls for adhesion. Since the channels are sealed with disposable tape, the cell sorter is easy to clean. The cell sorter was successfully used in the framework of a study on the bystander effect occurring during cell irradiation by sorting 30 cells in less than 3 minutes...|$|E

Plant toxicity and trace metal availability were determined and a reference experiment was set up with NaOH dose soil to reach the same pH. Trace element concentrations in plant shoots (Cu, Cr, Ni, B and Fe) increased significantly with increasing red mud dose, but were well below phytotoxicity thresholds. Nevertheless, plant growth was significantly decreased at the two highest doses due to increased Na uptake.

Impounded slurry and sludge materials from the reservoir traveled through underground mine works and burst through two mine portals on opposite sides of the mountain releasing more than 300 million gallons of coal waste into creeks and waterways of Martin County, KY. This paper examines people’s reactions to the Martin County coal waste disaster by examining levels of reported concern and perceptions of risk across the impacted community of Martin County in comparison to similar coal mining communities in the same watershed as well as elsewhere in Kentucky and West Virginia. Door-to-door, drop-off / pick-up methods were used to survey people’s perceptions. As predicted, findings show a significant difference in public opinion over the risks associated with coal waste impoundments between the impacted county in comparison to other counties. The other robust predictors of perceived risks were quality of life and trust measures. Other factors found to be significant in some previous studies of risk perceptions, such as home ownership and occupation could also account for some differences in risk perceptions within and across counties.

Originally sporadic and circumstantial, ACD occurrences have now become frequent in the Amazon region, with recently related outbreaks spreading to several Brazilian states. These cases {{are associated with the}} consumption of açai juice by <b>waste</b> <b>reservoir</b> animals or insect vectors infected with Trypanosoma cruzi in endemic areas. Although guidelines for processing the fruit to minimize contamination through microorganisms and parasites exist, açai-based products must be assessed for quality, for which the demand for appropriate methodologies must be met. METHODS: Dilutions ranging from 5 to 1, 000 T. cruzi CL Brener cells were mixed with 2 mL of acai juice. Four Extraction of T. cruzi DNA methods were used on the fruit, and the cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) method was selected according to JRC, 2005. RESULTS: DNA extraction by the CTAB method yielded satisfactory results with regard to purity and concentration for use in PCR. Overall, the methods employed proved that not only extraction efficiency but also high sensitivity in amplification was important. CONCLUSIONS: The method for T. cruzi detection in food is a powerful tool in the epidemiological investigation of outbreaks as it turns epidemiological evidence into supporting data that serve to confirm T. cruzi infection in the foods.
