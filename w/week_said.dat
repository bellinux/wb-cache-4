Entertainment Weekly reported that One Life to Live agreed to let Howarth go on the condition he would not appear on another soap opera for twelve months.

Aviation <b>Week</b> <b>said</b> the helicopter {{appeared to be a}} significantly modified MH-60 Black Hawk. Serial numbers found at the scene were consistent with an MH-60 built in 2009. Its performance during the operation confirmed that a stealth helicopter could evade detection in a militarily sensitive, densely populated area. Photos showed that the Black Hawk's tail had stealth-configured shapes on the boom and the fairings, swept stabilizers and a [...] "hubcap" [...] over the noise-reducing five- or six-blade tail rotor.

500|$|On her arrival, Susan was {{described}} as being [...] "staid" [...] and more open-minded than her husband, Karl. Woodburne told the Soap Show that Susan is a [...] "good mum" [...] who means well. Her children are her number one priority and she overcompensate's for her husband's disciplinarian style.

Network Ten say that Susan is the [...] "heart and soul of Erinsborough", with a good sense of humour and the skills of a ninja. Susan has been through a [...] "rough ride". She has had to cope with Karl's infidelity, a divorce, her second husband dying hours after their wedding, being betrayed by her nephew and revealing that she killed her mother. TV <b>Week</b> <b>said</b> [...] "But, through it all, Susan has often provided a home for people in trouble, including a number of the Timmins kids and the kids of her dead husband."

In an attempt to impress Ivan and to show how mature she is, Natasha sends him [...] "raunchy photos" [...] of herself.

Make sure you stuff your pockets with singles, 'cause you'll be spending {{at least a}} good hour at the rack." [...] Similarly, the Seattle alternative weekly The Stranger said the venue was [...] "perhaps the funnest place {{in all the world}} ... especially when the fellers trot on stage in a vast array of hilarious costumes". The paper's Wm. Steven Humphrey wrote, [...] "These nudie cuties were born to entertain, and prove it by leaping from stage to tabletop, hanging naked upside down (by the tops of their FEET!!), and if you're extremely lucky, gingerly lifting a dollar bill off your forehead with their ass cheeks. Now that's talent!" [...] Byron Beck of Willamette <b>Week</b> <b>said</b> the dancers at Three Sisters [...] " [...] a quaint queer tavern into the most mouthwatering of watering holes in P-town". The paper also called the club [...] "the best place to view wiener-wiggling".|$|E

Jackie Brygel of TV <b>Week</b> <b>said</b> Susan {{has a lot to}} prove with Paul breathing down her neck, but her new role puts her health in jeopardy when she begins displaying signs of an MS relapse. Woodburne explained [...] "She's working 24 hours a day {{to try to get the}} paper to take on a different form and is running herself into the ground.

[...] Susan Hill of the Daily Star reported Susan refuses to turn to Karl, who always helped her with an episode, and instead she relies on help from Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber). Woodburne revealed Karl asks Susan to slow down, but she ignores him.

Susan finds herself unable to do the housework, but Rhys understands that she wants to keep her independence. A spokesperson told Hill [...] "She always knew it was going to be hard living alone but Karl is the last person she wants to turn to. She doesn't want to admit she needs him but she does.

After Keller's death, Willamette <b>Week</b> <b>said</b> that the club [...] "has cemented its place in history far beyond the city limits" [...] for featuring Love and Jorgensen and offering nudity to a loyal customer base. The newspaper's Mary Christmas wrote that Keller had become a [...] "regional celebrity" [...] and could be credited with beginning a local industry. In 2011, a contributor to the Daily Vanguard (Portland State University's student newspaper) included Mary's on his list of the city's top five strip clubs: [...] "If you visit only one dance club in this town it should probably be Mary’s. The inside is stuffy and sleazy, but embodies that red-light district feel that fits right in with [...] rowdy environment." [...] That year, Willamette Week called the club [...] "the undisputed grande dame of West Coast strips" [...] and [...] "a stubbornly degenerate landmark". According to the newspaper's Matthew Korfhage, its entertainment {{came in the form of}} [...] "girls/ladies, friendly also brassy, oddly classy, with sterling taste on the juke, who let you see all of their piercings and tattoos. Also, video poker". In 2013, Portland Monthly made Mary's Club an [...] "editor's pick" [...] for its dancers, its all-female staff, and its [...] "welcoming and relaxed" [...] environment.

No, no one's worried about him." ...|$|R
