One of their most {{important}} jobs were to answer questions, including those surrounding the canteen and the basics of the North Platte and Nebraska. Another important job was to tend to those on the hospital trains who were unable to enter the building. The men on the trains were naturally treated the same as those who went inside. Magazines, religious literature, and decks of cards were also distributed to the servicemen on the trains. If they were unable to disembark from the cars, women would <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the aisles distributing goods or hand up materials from the ground to the windows.|$|E
25|$|At {{the sight}} of the Spaniards, the French {{displayed}} their banners, sounded their fifes and drums, and offered them battle, but Menéndez took no notice of the demonstration. Commanding his own men, whom he had again disposed to produce an impression of numbers, to sit down and take breakfast, he turned to <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the shore with two of his captains in full sight of the French. Then Ribault called a halt, sounded a trumpet-call, and displayed a white flag, to which Menéndez replied in the same fashion. The Spaniards having refused to cross at the invitation of Ribault, a French sailor swam over to them, and came back immediately in an Indian canoe, bringing the request that Ribault send over someone authorized to state what he wanted.|$|E
25|$|On December 20, 2010 Yon {{was found}} to be curled up and unmoving near a dried stream. He was brought into the center's {{rehabilitation}} room, where it was discovered that he had pulmonary edema, which had nearly killed him; however, he was able to eat by the next day and gradually got better. He was unable to walk for the remainder of December, though by the end of January he had regained this ability and, during February and March, he improved {{enough to be able to}} <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down stairs. However, his condition then took a turn for the worse, and he died on the night of April 9 at an estimated fifteen years and one month old. He weighed 3.5 kilograms and was 78.5 centimeters long. He is the oldest Iriomote cat on record.|$|E

2500|$|Bogart, a heavy smoker and drinker, had {{developed}} {{cancer of the}} esophagus. He almost never spoke of his failing health and refused {{to see a doctor}} until January 1956 after much persistence from Bacall. A diagnosis of cancer was made several weeks later. He underwent a surgical operation on March 1, 1956, where his entire esophagus, two lymph nodes, and a rib were removed but, by then, {{it was too late to}} halt the disease, even with chemotherapy. He underwent corrective surgery in November 1956 after the cancer had spread. With time, he grew too weak to <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down stairs, fighting the pain yet still able to joke: [...] "Put me in the dumbwaiter and I'll ride down to the first floor in style." [...] It was then altered to accommodate his wheelchair. [...] Frank Sinatra was a frequent visitor, as were Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.
