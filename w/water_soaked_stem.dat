50|$|Gummy Stem Blight is a cucurbit-rot disease {{caused by}} the fungal plant {{pathogen}} Didymella bryoniae (anamorph Phoma cucurbitacearum).Gummy Stem Blight can affect a host at any stage of growth in its development and affects {{all parts of the}} host including leaves, stems and fruits. Symptoms generally consist of circular dark tan lesions that blight the leaf, <b>water</b> <b>soaked</b> leaves, <b>stem</b> cankers, and gummy brown ooze that exudes from cankers, giving it the name Gummy Stem Blight. Gummy Stem Blight reduces yields of edible cucurbits by devastating the vines and leaves and rotting the fruits. There are various methods to control Gummy Stem Blight, including use of treated seed, crop rotation, using preventative fungicides, eradication of diseased material, and deep plowing previous debris.|$|R

30|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been made on the {{relationships}} between cyclic boil-dry treatment and board properties [6 – 8], but very few have detailed the effects of water-soaking condition on board properties. For example, when we compare 2  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 70  °C (A test in JIS) and 2  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 100  °C (B test in JIS), obviously the latter is more severe than the former, decreasing the latter properties more than the former [4]. Comparing 6  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 70  °C with 2  h <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> at 100  °C, {{it is very difficult}} to predict which condition decreases the board properties. In order to develop an optimum accelerated aging test, it is paramount to determine the effects of soaking temperature and time on board properties.

30|$|Given that {{boards are}} nailed when used for {{structural}} purposes, {{it is important}} to clarify the effects of <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> on the properties of these boards. However, <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> tests have been conducted not to assess nail joint property, but to assess the modulus of rupture (MOR) and internal bond strength (IB), which hereafter are defined as basic properties. Moreover, the relationships between nail joint properties and the basic properties of the board <b>soaked</b> in <b>water</b> have not been clarified.|$|R
30|$|Except for the IB of the PF board, {{as for the}} MOR of the PF board, the MOR and IB of the MDI board, {{there are}} {{differences}} between <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> and outdoor exposure. In particular, the MOR retention of <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> was higher than that of outdoor exposure. The boards <b>soaked</b> in <b>water</b> have poor mechanical properties solely because of the collapse of the bonding points, and the mechanism for the reduction of the properties is very simple. In contrast, the boards exposed outdoors have poor properties because of the collapse of the bonding points and biodegradation [10]. These factors interact, resulting in a major reduction in the properties of the boards exposed outdoors than {{in the case of the}} boards <b>soaked</b> in <b>water.</b> These differences between outdoor exposure and <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> cause different reductions in the properties of both boards.|$|R

Citric acid in the blanch water enhanced the colour of the canned 3 S treated mushrooms.

Prestoring mushrooms for 72 hr prior to the 3 S process had no effect on total shrinkage values but gave a less white canned product.

40|$|Identifying {{superior}} Salicaceae genotypes for afforestation {{and restoration}} activities {{in urban areas}} can greatly increase the provision of ecosystem services for long-term ecological sustainability. To address this opportunity, we collected native Populus L. (Salicaceae) and Salix L. (Salicaceae) scions from 3 sites on Staten Island, New York, and conducted a propagation study followed by greenhouse and nursery scale-up activities. Our objectives were to: 1) identify hormone treatments that enhanced root initiation and early growth of the native genotypes; 2) incorporate Salicaceae prop-agation methodology into phyto-recurrent selection; and 3) establish a population of genotypes {{that can be used}} for afforestation and restoration efforts throughout New York City. For Objective 1, we tested the response of 112 native genotypes and 11 common clones to 3 root hormone treatments (36 -h <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> plus 12 -h soak in 1 % IBA + 0. 5 % NAA; 48 -h <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> plus powder dip in 0. 3 % IBA; 48 -h <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> plus 5 -s dip soak in 20 % IBA) and a <b>water</b> <b>soak</b> control. After 75 d of growth, the control treatment was more effective than the 0. 3 % IBA powder dip and as effective as the other treatments. Given broad clonal variation, there is a high probability of selecting genotypes for both afforestation and restoration. Although Salix exhibited greater relative propagation success than Populus, both genera should be used to in-crease overall genetic diversity. From a practical standpoint, scale-up activities led to establishment of a nursery population that will be used for ongoing afforestation and restoration activities in New York City...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Adhesion {{properties}} of soy protein isolate (SPI) on fiber cardboard {{and effects of}} press conditions, pre-pressing drying time, and protein concentrations on gluing strength were investigated. Shear strength increased as press time, press pres-sure, and/or press temperature increased. The effect of tempera-ture on shear strength became more significant at high press pressure. The shear strength of the SPI adhesive on fiber card-board decreased by 12 – 25 % after <b>water</b> <b>soaking.</b> Shear strength increased as pre-pressing drying time increased and reached its maximal value at about 10 min. An SPI/water ratio of 12 : 100 (w/w) gave the highest gluing strength.

Firstly, open cracked rice (OCR) grains were sorted by crack direction, then a composition rate of DCR grain, included in cooked rice was measured. As a result, transverse and longitudinal cracked grains were derived from the OCR grain. In addition, it was suggested that unevenness of <b>water</b> distribution within <b>soaked</b> rice kernel caused a difference in swelling distribution between central part and periphery of the kernel, according generated it flatly-broadened grain. Secondly, the composition rate of DCR grain in milled rice with low moisture content was measured for each treatment.

Finally, the hardness, stickiness and balance of cooked rice were measured. The value of balance for the treatment of vacuum infusion combined with heated <b>water</b> <b>soaking</b> and tempering which is positive by correlating with eating quality was the highest among all treatments, so it appeared that this treatment maintained the eating quality of low moisture content rice. Therefore, tempering treatment was considered as the best way for keeping the appearance and eating quality of low moisture content rice. Further experiment for investigating the optimization of tempering condition and finding the generation mechanism of flatly-broadened grain by using a morphologic approach is needed. 本研究は，減圧含浸処理に温水浸潰処理とテンパリング処理を組み合わせて低水分白米に施し，炊飯崩壊粒の発生を抑制することを目的とした．まず，浸漬後の白米を裂傷の有無および裂傷の方向別に分類して炊飯した際の炊飯米の形状別の構成割合を測定した．その結果，横割れ炊飯粒および縦割れ炊飯粒の多くは水浸裂傷粒から発生し，また，扁平炊飯粒は，炊飯直前の米粒中心部における水分不足によって炊飯時に米粒部位による膨潤率の差が生じ，変形を引き起こしたものと推察された．次に，減圧含浸処理に温水浸漬およびテンパリングを組み合わせて低水分白米を調製した後，炊飯して得られた炊飯米の形状別の構成割合を測定した．その結果テンパリング処理は扁平炊飯粒の抑制効果があり，また，減圧含浸と温水浸漬の組み合わせ処理により横割れ炊飯粒および縦割れ炊飯粒の抑制効果が見られた．最後に，低水分米にそれぞれの処理を施した後の炊飯米の硬さおよび粘りを測定し，バランス度を算出した．その結果，食味と正の相関があるバランス度が，最も高い値を示したのはテンパリング区であったことから，テンパリング処理は低水分米の食味低下を抑制する効果が認められた．これらの結果から，炊飯米の形状および食味に関し，テンパリング区が最も良好な結果を得た．今後は，テンパリング処理の最適処理条件の究明および形態学的なアプローチによる扁平炊飯粒の発生機構の解明を行う予定である...|$|R
