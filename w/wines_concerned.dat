In order to evaluate if dealcoholized wines differed from the untreated ones, triangle sensory tests were performed. Both - 2 % wines were not perceived as different from the standard wines, while both - 5 % wines were different. Sensory profiles and overall quality ranking were obtained by a selected and trained panel. Dealcoholization caused a modification of the sensory profiles, and the greatest differences were found after a dealcoholization of 5 % v/v.

40|$|Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a fungal {{secondary}} metabolite produced by Aspergillus and Penicillium species. It has been detected {{in a wide}} range of commodities, including cereals, coffee, grapes, raisins, must and wine. Within grape derivative products, the raisins, red wine and sweet wines have reported to contain the highest OTA levels. Aspergillus section Nigri (A. niger and A. carbonarius) are considered the OTA source in these commodities and they are commonly isolated among other fungi from grapes and raisins. Starting from this basis the objectives of this thesis were focused into three main aspects: (1) Evaluation of the food products: vine dried fruits and special <b>wines,</b> <b>concerning</b> the mycobiota and OTA occurrence and incidence; (2) Ecophysiological studies of the ochratoxigenic fungi and accompanying mycobiota as affected by environmental conditions; (3) Control and preventive methods such as the evaluation of residual activity of pre-harvest fungicides during grape dehydration and the use of modified atmospheres. Wine origin and winemaking procedure showed to be determinant for the final OTA content. All special wines analysed from northern European regions were negative for OTA while more than 50 % of wines from warmer regions were positive for OTA contamination. The wines with higher OTA levels were fortified musts followed by those made from dried grapes. Acoholic and malo-lactic fermentations, biological 'crianza' (Flor yeast) and the action of Botrytis cinerea in noble rot of grapes may diminish the OTA levels in wine. In grapes, the presence of Aspergillus section Nigri became predominant at harvest and mainly during sun-drying. Prevalence of Aspergillus section Nigri can be explained by their adaptation to environmental conditions of sun-drying, and by their ability to dominate other fungal species involved when coming into contact with them.

All isolates were taxonomically characterized using molecular approaches i. e. sequencing of the variable ITS 1 - 5. 8 S rDNA - ITS 2 and D 1 /D 2 regions. Based on these analyses, the isolates from Sample I, exhibiting β-glucosidase activity, were identified as: H. gulliermondii (ΖΥ 1, ΖΥ 2, ΖΥ 3), R. mucilaginosa (ΖΥ 5), P. anomala (ΖΥ 4) and M. pulcherrima, var. zitsae (ΖΥ 6). Regarding the isolates of Sample II, all indigenous strains proved {{to belong to}} the species S. cerevisiae. Proceeding with the investigation {{of the impact of the}} indigenous yeast on wine characteristics, various isolated strains were used as starter cultures for the production of the local Debina wine.

Design/methodology/approach – The {{aim of this}} study is to identify perceptions, attitudes and behavior of young adults <b>concerning</b> <b>wine</b> consumption, using the “theory of planned behavior” as a theoretical framework. Findings – The major findings are that attitudes and subjective norms are, apparently, the components with most influence on behavior of young people in relation to wine consumption. For the consumers group, attitudes seem to be the most crucial component, especially the “interest in alcohol”. They drink it in special occasions for sociability and to disinhibit. Regarding the non-consumers group, the main attitude is “dislike taste”. Also the subjective norms, are very present, especially parents, society, friends and publicity, in consumers group. The non-consumers have the perception of greater parental induction to not consume wine. No significant differences were found between gender or educational system.

40|$|Phenolic {{compounds}} {{are important}} constituents {{of white wine}} that can impart bitterness and astringency and influence stability and colour. The specific types and concentrations of phenolic compounds vary between the different grape tissues. For example grape skins contain much higher concentrations of phenolics than grape pulp. Consequently, grape processing techniques, particularly the method by which juice is expressed, can influence the phenolic profile of white <b>wines.</b> <b>Concerns</b> of elevated phenolic levels tend to lead to conservative practices such as limiting the time between machine harvesting and winery processing, {{and the use of}} relatively expensive batch draining and pressing equipment. Phenolic extraction during pomace contact, such as might occur after machine harvesting prior to winery processing, was investigated at a controlled laboratory scale. Contact time significantly increased phenolic extraction as did the fraction of broken berries. However, given the uncertainty in the amount of berry breakage in industrial practice, full scale transport trials should be performed by wineries where economic advantage could be gained from relaxing restriction on times between harvesting and winery processing. Techniques used for white grape juice expression both now and in the past were critically reviewed and winery sampling was performed to develop a practical understanding of operational issues. For the expression of juice from white grapes, pneumatic membrane presses have been increasingly adopted both for pressing and draining. This is principally a product of their ability to express high yields of juice with relatively low levels of phenolics and suspended solids. These devices can be operated in many different manners and quality and productivity is highly dependent on the specific mode of operation. Adaptive programmes based principally on continuous assessment of juice flow rate, and the use of conductivity measurement to monitor skin extraction are important tools that can aid economic optimisation of expression operations. The principal problem with the pneumatic membrane press {{is that it is a}} batch operation with a relatively low throughput. In the longer term, the ideal outcome would be the development of expression equipment that achieved the high throughput and relatively low cost per tonne of continuous inclined drainers and screw presses, while still maintaining the quality obtained with pneumatic membrane presses. Continuous devices that mimic the repeated cycles of compression and crumbling of these batch presses may be one means of achieving this. Exploration of the different continuous screw presses used historically suggests that there still may be room for improvement in these devices. This merits further specific investigation. Experiments involving repeated cycles of compression and crumbling were performed with a constant rate laboratory apparatus. These experiments demonstrated the importance of bed height, pressing speed, sieve plate design and crumbling on press operation. Solids content appears to be a major issue in the development of rapid juice expression equipment. One means of achieving appropriately low solids levels, without requiring large devices with large cake beds for juice filtration, may be to maintain the structure of the grape for as long as possible so that juice is filtered as it is expelled from the berry.

High affinity isotherms and high adsorption capacities were observed for grape PAs and whole cells (Y, IY, and A-IY). Affinity and adsorbed amount were lower with wine PAs, due to chemical changes occurring during winemaking. By contrast to whole cells, grape PAs and WP adsorption on CW remained very low.
