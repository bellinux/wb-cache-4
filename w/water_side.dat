5|$|In March 2005, the {{construction}} process {{began with the}} sinking of the first caisson for the tower into the bedrock. In April, construction began on the foundation below the Chicago River. In July 2005, water from the river began seeping into the building site, through crevices in a corner where the foundation wall meets the Wabash Avenue Bridge. Divers discovered that the leak could not be sealed from the <b>water</b> <b>side.</b> After several other failed attempts to correct the problem, they drove a steel plate next to the gap and filled the space between with concrete after digging it out.|$|E
25|$|Although {{giant hogweed}} is taking hold along the Annick (2006), however the {{riparian}} (<b>water</b> <b>side)</b> flora is still indicative of long established and undisturbed habitats. The rare crosswort, (a {{relative of the}} goosegrass or cleavers) is found nearby. The river contains, amongst others, brown trout, sea trout, salmon, eels, minnows, and stickleback. The water quality is much improved since the Stewarton cloth mills closed and the river no longer carries their dyes and other pollutants {{as shown by the}} presence of freshwater limpets and shrimps, together with leeches, caddis fly larvae and water snail species.|$|E
25|$|Eliot first envisioned today's river {{design in}} the 1890s, an {{important}} model being {{the layout of the}} Alster basin in Hamburg, but major construction began only after Eliot's death with the damming of the river's mouth at today's Boston Museum of Science, an effort led by James Jackson Storrow. The new dam, completed in 1910, stabilized the water level from Boston to Watertown, eliminating the existing mud flats, and a narrow embankment was built between Leverett Circle and Charlesgate. After Storrow's death, his widow Mrs. James Jackson Storrow donated $1 million toward the creation of a more generously landscaped park along the Esplanade; it was dedicated in 1936 as the Storrow Memorial Embankment. This also enabled the construction of many public docks in the Charles River Basin. In the 1950s a highway (Storrow Drive) was built {{along the edge of the}} Esplanade to connect Charles Circle with Soldiers Field Road, and the Esplanade was enlarged on the <b>water</b> <b>side</b> of the new highway.|$|E

2500|$|The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway (SLS) was {{the first}} to run a rail line along the water, in 1887, with a depot near the foot of Columbia Street on Western Avenue. The SLS was {{eventually}} purchased by the Northern Pacific Railway. James J. Hill's Great Northern Railway eventually laid track even farther to the <b>water</b> <b>side.</b> Railroad Avenue, the route of both railways, was [...] wide and built mainly on pilings over tideflats.

50|$|A boiler {{explosion}} is {{a catastrophic}} {{failure of a}} boiler. As seen today, boiler explosions are of two kinds. One kind is {{a failure of the}} pressure parts of the steam and <b>water</b> <b>sides.</b> There can be many different causes, such as failure of the safety valve, corrosion of critical parts of the boiler, or low water level. Corrosion along the edges of lap joints was a common cause of early boiler explosions.|$|R

50|$|Lingula is a genus of brachiopods {{within the}} class Lingulata. Lingula or forms very close in {{appearance}} have existed possibly since the Cambrian. Like its relatives, {{it has two}} unadorned organo-phosphatic valves and a long fleshy stalk. Lingula lives in burrows in barren sandy coastal seafloor and feeds by filtering detritus from the water. It can be detected by a short row of three openings through which it takes in <b>water</b> (<b>sides)</b> and expels it again (middle).|$|R
