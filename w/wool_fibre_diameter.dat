We conducted studies to compare the meat quality traits of Merinos with those of first- and second-cross lambs.

However, studies of the quality of meat from Merinos were unanimous in that Merinos produce meat that rates highly in terms of flavour, tenderness and overall acceptability. In one study, the retail display-life of loin meat from Merinos was inferior; high pH has been a consistent problem with Merino meat for a number of years. The prevalence of high-pH meat can be minimised by on-farm concentrate feeding, increasing the plane of nutrition of pasture-fed lambs prior to consignment, using sires with a high estimated breeding value for muscling, minimising stress factors between farm and slaughter and using sires with low agitation scores.

40|$|Wool has unique attributes, but {{to compete}} with synthetics, the wool {{industry}} is {{looking for ways to}} improve their product. The use of gene-markers is one of improving the selection of genetically superior stock. The Keratin-associated proteins (KAPs) are believed to {{play a critical role in}} determining wool traits and they therefore are ideal candidates for the development of gene-markers. This research identified variation in five previously identified ovine KAP genes (KRTAP 1 - 4, KRTAP 5 - 4, KRTAP 6 - 1, KRTAP 7 - 1 and KRTAP 8 - 1), and the KRTAP 1 - 2, KRTAP 6 - 2, KRTAP 6 - 3, KRTAP 8 - 2, KRTAP 11 - 1, KRTAP 13 - 3 and KRTAP 24 - 1 genes as well. All of them were polymorphic. Given the diversity in KAP genes, an updated KAP nomenclature was created and is now in use globally. The impact of variation in KRTAP 1 - 2 and KRTAP 6 - 1 on wool traits was investigated, with variation in KRTAP 1 - 2 being associated with Clean Fleece Weight (CFW), Greasy Fleece Weight (GFW) and yield.

A total of 48 lambs, over two consecutive years (n= 24 per year), was randomly allocated into Spirulina supplementation level (CONTROL, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) groups and balanced by sire breed (Black Suffolk, Dorset, Merino, White Suffolk) and sex (ewes, wethers). Lambs had ad libitum access to a basal diet of pasture and Lucerne hay, and had Spirulina supplement daily throughout the 42 -day feeding trial, after a 21 -day adjustment phase. Mid-side wool samples were removed from each lamb {{at the beginning and}} end of the feeding trial and commercially analysed for quality. The wool quality data were transformed into 'wool trait change over the feeding trial period' by the difference between the wool measurements {{at the beginning and end}} of the experiment prior to statistical analysis. Wool clean fleece weight (CFW) was significantly influenced by level of supplementation, basal diet and sex (P< 0. 05). Spirulina-supplemented lambs on Lucerne hay basal diet elicited higher CFW responses which increased with supplementation level. CONTROL lambs had the lightest CFW regardless of basal diet. Sire breed and sex variations were significant (P< 0. 05) as wool from Suffolk-sired lambs and ewes had the highest fibre diameter coefficient of variation (CV) and CFW, respectively. CV and fibre diameter standard deviation were the most affected wool traits by significant interactions between Spirulina supplementation level, sire breed and sex.

40|$|For the Arid Shrublands of Western Australia (WA) {{knowledge}} is limited on what sheep eat and how nutritious their diets are. A study was undertaken on two stations near Yalgoo (28 º 18 ’S 116 º 38 ’E) in WA, from November 2005 to December 2007. Station 1 (28 º 39 ’S 116 º 18 ’E) used a flexible rotational grazing management system (RGS), moving 3000 - 4000 Merino sheep every 3 – 6 weeks through {{a choice of}} 20 paddocks. Station 2 (28 º 18 ’S 116 º 42 ’E) used a flexible continuous grazing management system where small mobs (500 sheep) stayed in paddocks all year, until shearing. Two paddocks on Station 2 were chosen to represent paddocks with high (CGS-G) and low (CGS-P) feed value. A total of 300 Merino hogget (18 months old) ewes {{were randomly selected from}} the stations. One hundred and fifty sheep from each station were selected and separated into three mobs of 50 sheep by stratifying live weights. The selected sheep were allocated to either of the two paddocks on Station 2 or the single rotating mob on Station 1. Therefore there were a total of 100 sheep, 50 from each station, on each of the two paddocks on Station 2 and the one rotating mob on Station 1. Throughout the study period sheep live weights, body condition scores (BCS) and wool production were measured and related to plant photosynthetic activity (derived from Normalised Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI), and dietary energy, protein and digestibility (determined from faecal NIRS calibrations). A DNA reference data bank of some common native plant species was established and then used as a library to identify plant species in sheep faeces and thus provide information on variations in diet composition over the study period. Plant nutritional content was also measured and compared to climatic changes and sheep nutrition. Over the study period Merino ewe live weights, wool production, faecal samples and native plant leaf material were collected and analysed from each of the three management treatments (RGS, CGS-G, CGS-P). Wool production measurements included wool length, strength and fibre diameter, including position of breaks, minimum and maximum diameter along the staple of midside samples. Oven dried plant and faecal samples were ground and subsequently analysed for proximate composition. Plant samples were further analysed for mineral contents and 24 h in vitro gas production (GP) using the rumen buffer gas fermentation technique. Organic matter digestibility (OMD) and metabolisable energy (ME) content of the plants were determined using 24 h net gas production. Faecal near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (fNIRS) calibrations, developed by Curtin University of Technology and ChemCentre WA, were used to predict the nutritional attributes of sheep diets. Sheep production was found to be affected by rainfall, seasons, management and differing blood lines. In 2006, live weights, BCS and <b>wool</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> increased in response to high summer rainfall. Lower rainfall in 2007 resulted in variable, but generally less animal production with lower live weights, BCS and <b>wool</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter.</b> Management decisions to avoid mating in 2006 on CGS; and agistment for sheep on RGS at the end of 2006 resulted in better sheep production results. Sheep originally sourced from Station 2 generally had higher live weights than sheep sourced from Station 1, suggesting a difference in bloodlines. Faecal DNA provided useful information regarding diet selection and diversity of sheep grazing on the Arid Shrublands of WA. Of the species that were DNA profiled, the sheep ate Acacia saligna, Aristida contorta, Atriplex spp., Enchylaena tomentosa, Frankenia sp., Ptilotus obovatus, Rhagodia eremaea and Scaevola spinescens in 2006 whilst in 2007; the sheep consumed A. saligna, A. contorta, Atriplex spp., Eremophila forrestii, Enneapogon caerulescens, Frankenia spp., Maireana spp., Ptilotus obovatus, Rhagodia eremaea, Solanum lasiophyllum and Stipa elegantissima. However, there were 28 amplified bands in 2006 and 51 in 2007 that did not conclusively match any of the reference plant species. This indicates that the sheep were consuming diets that contained more species than what was analysed in this study. Faecal DNA results indicated a decrease in the diversity of the diets selected by the sheep during summer, which coincided with a decrease in animal production. Native plants were found to be low in OMD and ME, but high in crude protein (CP), and variable in mineral content. Sheep were able to select diets adequate in OMD, ME and CP for maintenance requirements, and low in tannins and phenolics, although continuous drought conditions resulted in reduced production, indicating that the sheep were not getting adequate nutrition to meet their growth requirements. The use of fNIRS provided more useful information {{about the quality of the}} diet of the sheep than nutritionally profiling individual plants. NDVI was found to be related to dietary OMD and <b>wool</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> changes along the staple. Overall, the effects of management seemed to be secondary to the effects of climate on sheep production and nutrition. The statistical accuracy of results was low; however, the use of advanced technologies to explore relationships between climate, plant nutritional profiles and animal production and nutrition has provided an expansion of knowledge of sheep nutrition in the region. This extra knowledge may help land owners in the region to make more sustainable management decisions concerning livestock management and grazing pressures on native pastures...|$|E

The aim of this work was to determine if adding salt to canola meal would increase the amount and efficiency of wool grown. The sheep were fed 560 g/d of a basal diet of wheaten hay and a mineral mix (Siromin). All sheep were offered for six weeks a supplement of 1050 g/week canola meal with 0, 280, 560 or 840 g of added salt. Sheep fed the supplement containing 840 g salt decreased their intake of the canola meal-salt supplement compared to those fed other levels of salt. As the amount of salt in the diet increased so did water intake. There was a polynomial increase in wool growth in response to level of added salt but the effect was only significant at P < 0. 12. When wool growth was expressed as a function of supplement intake there was a significant linear increase in wool growth as the amount of salt in the supplement increased (P = 0. 015).

The effectiveness of this practice {{is determined by the}} relative response to selection by measuring fibre traits on a full 12 months wool staple as compared to measuring them only on part of a staple. If a high genetic correlation exists between the part record and the full record, then using part records may be acceptable to identify genetically superior animals. No information is available on the effectiveness of part records. This paper investigated whether <b>wool</b> growth and <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> traits of Merino wool grown at different times of the year in a Mediterranean environment, are genetically the same trait, respectively. The work was carried out on about 7 dyebanded wool sections/animal. year, on ewes from weaning to hogget age, in the Katanning Merino resource flocks over 6 years. Relative clean wool growth of the different sections had very low heritability estimates of less than 0. 10, and they were phenotypically and genetically poorly correlated with 6 or 12 months wool growth. This indicates that part record measurement of clean wool growth of these sections will be ineffective as indirect selection criteria to improve wool growth genetically. Staple length growth as measured by the length between dyebands, would be more effective with heritability estimates of between 0. 20 and 0. 30. However, these measurements were shown to have a low genetic correlation with wool grown for 12 months which implies that these staple length measurements would only be half as efficient as the wool weight for 6 or 12 months to improve total clean wool weight. Heritability estimates of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter,</b> coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> and <b>fibre</b> curvature were relatively high and were genetically and phenotypically highly correlated across sections. High positive phenotypic and genetic correlations were also found between <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter,</b> coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> and <b>fibre</b> curvature of the different sections and similar measurements for wool grown over 6 or 12 months. Coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> of the sections also had a moderate negative phenotypic and genetic correlation with staple strength of wool staples grown over 6 months indicating that coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> of any section would be as good an indirect selection criterion to improve stable strength as coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> for <b>wool</b> grown over 6 or 12 months. The results indicate that <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter,</b> coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> and <b>fibre</b> curvature of <b>wool</b> grown over short periods of time have virtually the same heritability as that of wool grown over 12 months, and that the genetic correlation between <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter,</b> coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> and <b>fibre</b> curvature on part and on full records is very high (rg > 0. 85). This indicates that <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter,</b> coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> and <b>fibre</b> curvature on part records can be used as selection criteria to improve these traits. However, part records of greasy and clean wool growth would be much less efficient than fleece weight for wool grown over 6 or 12 months because of the low heritability of part records and the low genetic correlation between these traits on part records and on wool grown for 12 months...|$|R
40|$|The GrassGro ™ {{model was}} used to {{simulate}} profitability of 14 sheep enterprises at four locations in south-eastern Australia. The simulated enterprises were: Merino wethers (superfine and fine wool); self-replacing Merino ewes (fine and medium wool); dual-purpose Merino ewes (fine and medium wool) joined to terminal sires; prime lamb first-cross ewes joined to terminal sires. A sheep model was also used to compare a self-replacing Merino enterprise with dual-purpose and prime lamb enterprises. GrassGro simulations highlighted that the fine-wool dual-purpose enterprise was the most profitable, followed by the prime lamb, self-replacing Merino and Merino wether systems. From 1999 – 2003, when a large premium existed for superfine-wool, Merino yearlings with superfine wool were as profitable as the fine-wool dual-purpose enterprise. The sheep model analysis showed that Merino yearlings had slightly greater gross margins than other enterprises when mean wool and meat prices for 1994 – 2004 were used, but not when prices for meat were high in relation to those of wool (June 2003 -May 2004). In the sheep model comparisons, spring lambing resulted in greater gross margins than winter lambing and production of yearlings was more profitable than production of weaners. The dual purpose Merino meat–wool enterprise is resilient against changes in commodity prices, but the genetic merit (<b>wool</b> production, <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> and liveweight) of ewes purchased or bred should be considered. A prime lamb enterprise, using first-cross ewes, will not necessarily be more profitable than systems using a Merino ewe base, particularly when prices for first-cross ewes are high or when weaning percentages are low...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{melatonin}} on wool quality and thyroid function was studied. Ten ewes received a melatonin implant (M) on March 2004, and 10 ewes {{which were not}} implanted served as control (C). At monthly intervals over 12 months, f ibre length and growth were calculated, and plasma thyroxine (T 4) concentrations were measured. Wool samples (~N = 2000 fibres) were collected and <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter,</b> standard deviation and coefficient of variation of <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter,</b> spin fineness, comfort factor, 5 % of fibres «x » µm above the mean diameter, curve, and clean yield were measured. In summer, M ewes had significantly lower plasma T 4 concentrations than C ewes, with significant group (P < 0. 05) and season (P < 0. 01) effects. Melatonin ewes produced shorter wool than C ewes (P < 0. 001) and, in autumn, the differences were statistically significant. Fibre growth {{did not differ significantly}} between groups. Throughout the year, M ewes produced <b>wool</b> with a <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> (mean = 26. 5 ± 0. 2 µm) that was significantly (P < 0. 01) shorter than C wool (means = 27. 2 ± 0. 5 µm). Overall, the melatonin treatment had a significant (P < 0. 01) effect on mean comfort factor, and the differences between groups were significant (P < 0. 05) in summer and autumn. The overall annual mean curve value of wool produced by M ewes (80. 9 ± 1. 7) was significantly (P < 0. 01) lower than wool produced by C ewes (82. 8 ± 1. 3) and, in winter, the difference between groups was significant (P < 0. 05). In conclusion, exogenous melatonin in spring positively affected medium- and long-term measures of wool quality. The physiological processes mediatin...|$|R
40|$|Textiles {{have always}} been one of the {{essential}} materials for people and have a great variety of uses such as in clothing, agriculture, medical, automotive and aerospace applications. The sort of properties needed for any type of fabric basically depend on the structure of the fibre surface. Of many geometric attributes {{that can be used to}} describe the surface appearance of a fibre, yarn, or fabric sample, one of the more common is lustre. Mohair and <b>wool</b> <b>fibre</b> surface structure have been studied using optical microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Optical microscopy was also used to take <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> measurements. Another technique, goniophotometry, was used to make quantitative lustre measurements of mohair and <b>wool</b> <b>fibres.</b> The surface structure of mohair has got a faint pattern of scales where the scales are generally unpronounced or flat and relatively long. Wool has got a scaly surface structure where the scales overlap leading to interlocking of fibres. The scale configuration on the surface of mohair and <b>wool</b> <b>fibres</b> also differs. A qualitative connection between fibre lustre and the fibre surface structure was found. Because of its smooth surface relative to that of wool, mohair reflects a greater amount of incident light specularly whereas wool reflects most of the incident light diffusely. In general, mohair fibres have a higher lustre than wool due to its less prominent cuticle structure found on its surface. Furthermore, mohair fibres with the smallest diameters give an even higher lustre...|$|R
40|$|Keratin-associated {{proteins}} (KAPs) are structural {{components of}} <b>wool</b> and hair <b>fibres,</b> and {{are believed to}} play a role in defining the physico-mechanical properties of the <b>wool</b> <b>fibre.</b> In this study, the putative ovine homologue of the human KAP 26 - 1 gene (KRTAP 26 - 1) was sequenced and four variants (named A–D) were identified. The sequences shared some identity with each other and with other KRTAPs, but they had the greatest similarity with the human KRTAP 26 - 1 sequence. This suggests they represent different variants of ovine KRTAP 26 - 1. The association of these KRTAP 26 - 1 variants with wool traits was investigated in the 383 Merino-Southdown cross sheep. The presence of B was associated (p < 0. 05) with an increase in mean <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> (MFD), mean <b>fibre</b> curvature, and prickle factor (PF). The presence of C was found to be associated (p < 0. 05) with an increase in wool yield (Yield) and mean staple length (MSL), and a decrease in MFD, <b>fibre</b> <b>diameter</b> standard deviation (FDSD), and PF. The results suggest that sheep with C have, on average, higher wool quality. These results may be useful in the future development of breeding programs based on decreasing wool MFD and FDSD, or on increasing wool MSL...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} modelling {{one of the}} mechanisms, which {{governs the}} formation of <b>wool</b> <b>fibres.</b> The problem is investigated by constructing a mathematical model {{that is based on}} the geometry of the ultrastructure of the <b>wool</b> <b>fibres.</b> The deformed shapes of the <b>wool</b> <b>fibres</b> are obtained by minimising the strain energy calculated from the mathematical model. The objective {{of this study is to}} explore the relationship between the ultrastructure and the crimpy shape of the <b>wool</b> <b>fibres.</b> The first chapter gives the background information of <b>wool</b> <b>fibre,</b> the outline of the thesis and defines the problem. The second chapter examines the structures inside the <b>wool</b> <b>fibres</b> and the mechanisms, which govern the shapes of the <b>wools</b> <b>fibres.</b> The variables used to describe the fibre shapes are introduced here. Then, some simple examples are given to demonstrate the mathematical model. In the third chapter, the structures of the <b>wool</b> <b>fibres</b> are simplified with several assumptions and used to construct the basic model. Then, some results are given with various values of different parameters to demonstrate the properties of the model. Some modifications of the model are made, which include the addition of the cuticle shell and an approximate analytical model by Taylor's expansion. The fourth chapter develops another modification of the mathematical model with the addition of a 'macrofibril' structure. The fifth chapter gives the last modification of the model uses integration to calculate the total energy of the whole fibre. The sixth and the seventh chapters show the practical methods to measure the natural shape of a single fibre and the cross-section pattern of the fibre respectively. The measured natural shape of the <b>wool</b> <b>fibre</b> can be used to verify the local estimated shape of the <b>wool</b> <b>fibre,</b> which is calculated by the mathematical model with the measured cross-section pattern...|$|R
