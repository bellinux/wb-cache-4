40|$|ABSTRACT: There is a {{critical}} need for {{the development and implementation}} of appro-priate technologies to strengthen, repair and rehabilitate the infrastructure. FHWA studies estimate that the U. S. currently faces a $ 167 billion cost to repair deficient bridges and roads. In many cases, retrofit and rehabilitation by conventional means is very costly (due to both specialized equipment needs and closure of the structure during repair), if not im-possible (e. g., the additional dead load resulting from repair of a deck/beam could very well further damage the structure and cause its final failure). Due to their inherent light-ness, placement flexibility and resistance to corrosion, composites are logical substitutes for steel structural elements often used for the rehabilitation of bridge decks and columns. In this article, we focus on columnar structures where retrofit is needed to strengthen and increase compressive load carrying capacity. The use of a novel resin infusion technique is shown to contribute to substantial improvements in composite wrap efficiency. The use of 24 oz. <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> <b>roving</b> as the reinforcement in the composite wrap is shown to substantially increase both load carrying capacity and deformation capability of the stubs. It is shown that through the use of glass/carbon hybrids, replication of the initial behavior of concrete is possible, along with a simultaneous improvement in load-carrying capacity (by 72 70 %) and the creation of substantial increase in deformation capacity before failure...|$|R

40|$|Polymer {{composites}} {{have attracted}} the attention of researchers all over the world in the last decade. There are several advantages, environmental and economical, in various applications such as structural and food packaging of using bio composites over ordinary composites, especially those based on thermoplastic articles. Perhaps the biodegradability feature of such composites offers a natural solution for the problem in agricultural and marble waste management. Properties of composites are improved using fillers in the size of nanolevel as reinforcement. Filler like nano rice husk ash and silica with some treatment like chemical modification to the surface with 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane provides better performance than its natural structure. Hybrid nanocomposite laminates are prepared by hand layup method. The laminates are prepared using 5 layers of <b>glass</b> <b>woven</b> <b>roving</b> mates of 610 gsm and nanofiller content varied from 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 wt%.

The vibration properties are the amplitude, natural frequency, dynamic elastic moduli (young modulus in x, y directions and shear modulus in 1, 2 plane) and damping factor.

Sandwich panels with polyurethane core was found had higher flexural strength and higher energy absorption compared with sandwich panels with polyethylene core. From the observation, increasing the debonding strength of the core-face interface, the failure mode changed from debonding of the core-face interface to the failure of the face.

The tubes were of 56 mm diameter, and the cones top diameters were 65 mm. Cone semi-apical angles of 5 °, 10 °, 15 °, 20 ° and 25 ° were examined. Height of 120 mm was maintained for all the fabricated specimens. Effects of material used, cone semi apical angle and foam filler on the load-displacement relation, maximum load, crush force efficiency, and the specific energy absorption and failure mode were investigated. Results show that the foam filler improved the progressive crushing process, increased the maximum load and the absorbed energy of the bi-tubes. The maximum crushing load and the specific energy absorption increased with increasing the cone semi apical angle up to 20 ° for the empty bi-tubes and up to 25 ° for the foam filled bi-tubes.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} paper results {{of a series of}} plate impact {{experiments}} designed to study spall strength in glass–fiber reinforced polymer composites (GRP) are presented. Two GRP architectures are investigated—S 2 <b>glass</b> <b>woven</b> <b>roving</b> in Cycom 4102 polyester resin matrix and a balanced 5 -harness satin weave E-glass in a Ciba epoxy (LY 564) matrix. The GRP specimens were shock loaded using an 82. 5 mm bore single-stage gas-gun. A velocity interferometer was used to measure the particle velocity profile at the rear (free) surface of the target plate. The spall strength of the GRP was obtained {{as a function of the}} normal component of the impact stress and the applied shear-strain by subjecting the GRP specimens to normal shock compression and combined shock compression and shear loading, respectively. The spall strengths of the two GRP composites were observed to decrease with increasing levels of normal shock compression. Moreover, superposition of shear-strain on the normal shock compression was found to be highly detrimental to the spall strength. The E-glass reinforced GRP composite was found to have a much higher level of spall strength under both normal shock compression and combined compression and shear loading when compared to the S 2 -glass GRP composite. The maximum spall strength of the E-glass GRP composite was found to be 119. 5 MPa, while the maximum spall strength for the S 2 glass GRP composite was only 53. 7 MPa. These relatively low spall strength levels of the S 2 -glass and the E-glass fiber reinforced composites have important implications to the design and development of GRP-based light-weight integral armor...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work is to ascertain the failure modes under different loading speeds along with change in percentage of constituents of FRP composites. This involves experimental investigation of FRP composites with woven roving fibers and matrix. Different types of composites i. e. Glass: Epoxy, Glass: Polyester and (Carbon + Glass) : Epoxy {{are used in the}} investigation with change in percentage of constituents. The variability of fiber content of the composite is in the range of 0. 55 to 0. 65 weight fractions. The matrix dominated property, like inter laminar shear strength has been studied by three point bend test using INSTRON 1195 material testing machine with increasing five cross head velocities. The variation of inter laminar shear strength of laminates of FRP composites is significant for low loading speed and is not so prominent for high speed. The variation of inter laminar shear strengths are observed to be dependent on the type and amount of constituents present in the composites. The laminates with carbon fiber shows higher inter laminar shear strength than that of glass fiber composites. The laminates with epoxy matrix shows higher inter laminar shear strength than polyester matrix composites for the same fiber. There is no significant variation of inter laminar shear strength beyond loading speed 200 mm/min and this can be used for specifications of testing. Matrix resins such as polyester and epoxy are known to be highly rate sensitive. Carbon fiber are relatively rate independent and E – Glass fibers are rate sensitive.

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, for {{the purpose}} of {{achieving}} enhanced mechanical properties of fiber reinforced composites, hybridized composites containing a combination of two or more types of fiber reinforcements have been explored.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the delamination resistance of <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> fibre reinforced polymers (GFRP) {{and its influence}} on GFRP’s resistance to point impact. Two different types of laminates were fabricated by hand lay-up technique; (i) <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> fibre epoxy matrix laminates and (ii) <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> fibre epoxy matrix laminates with 3 % graphite particulate fillers. End Notch Flexure (ENF) test was adopted for the measurement of delamination resistance. The two GFRPs laminates show similar mode II delamination resistance. At impact velocities between 2. 215 and 4. 429 m/sec, the GFRP developed a smaller damage size than the graphite-based GFRP laminates, indicating higher impact toughness. Difference of the impact resistance between the two GFRPs is mainly on the impact damage size developed.
