25|$|The actress {{was known}} for her {{kindness}} to animals. She {{could not bear to}} see them abused or badly treated. Wheatley came upon a mule being beaten on Forsyth Street while {{she was a member of}} the Fawcett Stock Company in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1907. The animal was being beaten by a man with a hickory stick. She implored him to stop. Wheatley gave him a half dollar and begged him to restrain his temper. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> mule's handler was coaxing him in a soothing manner, which pleased Wheatley. Previously she had intervened to prevent small children from rocking a dog and stopped a cab driver from abusing an old horse.|$|E

25|$|The name of Poynton is of Old English derivation.

25|$|Author and {{reporter}} Richard M. Levine {{later wrote}} that compared to Marlene Olive, Riley did not harbor much anger at Naomi Olive, whom he barely knew, and therefore Riley {{would be less}} likely to use a method of homicide suggesting rage; that Riley would have used his loaded gun as the weapon rather than a hammer; and that Marlene Olive had previously asked Riley how hard she would have to hit Naomi Olive in order to kill her. However, others have noted that Marlene had no blood on her clothing <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> house and would not have had time to change clothes; that Riley used a hammer to avoid alerting neighbors because it made less noise than a gunshot; and that according to a hypnosis expert, Riley's revised confession lacked credibility. Marlene Olive continued to maintain that Riley had beaten and killed her mother in addition to shooting her father, and denied that she herself had any part in the killing of either parent.|$|E
25|$|Perales {{was born}} in Zaragoza on 29 December 1975. She has one sibling, a brother, who is seven years younger than her. When she was 15 years old, her father died from leukemia, and she was then raised by her single mother. At the age of 19, she {{developed}} neuropathy and lost feeling in her legs over a three-month period. The condition is relatively rare, and doctors did not initially know how to treat it. Instead, they were waiting {{to see how it}} progressed before deciding on the proper treatment. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> hospital {{for the first time in}} a wheelchair, she was embarrassed because she felt a need to explain to others the events that led to her becoming a paraplegic. She has very little leg strength and no sensation in her legs, and if she cuts herself while shaving her legs, she cannot feel the cut. Prior to contracting neuropathy, she was an active karate practitioner. The last time she was able to walk without assistance was on 10 May 1995 during the celebration of Zaragoza's la Recopa victory. Perales earned a Diploma in Physiotherapy, which she earned from the Universidad de Zaragoza where she was a student from 1996 to 1999.|$|E
500|$|The single reel film, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on January 31, 1911. The Billboard praised Marie Eline's acting also noting the good photography in its review. The Moving Picture Worlds review states, [...] "The part played by the grandmother and the one played by the child are both pathetic and cannot fail to touch the heart. The person who can sit through this and not feel the tears welling up to his eyes is strangely callous to human grief and emotion." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was open in its praise of the film and its portrayal of the subject through good acting, but it also noted the technical faults with film continuity. The reviewer wrote, [...] "It was noticed that the old lady's bag was brought on immediately, already packed, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> son's house and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> home. It looks planned beforehand – similar incidents have hurt the excellence {{of a number of}} this company's superior films. It would take time in life, and a split in the film would have done it. Such things spoil the illusion to a spectator." ...|$|E

At the Royal Rumble in 1989, she defended the title against Judy Martin. Smith defended the belt against Martin {{for the first six}} months of 1989. In the meantime, at WrestleMania V, she sang [...] "America the Beautiful" [...] to open the show. Smith continued to defend the Women's title against Martin throughout the summer of 1989. She held the championship until 1990, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> company. At that time, the title was retired by the WWF due to inactivity. Smith is still in possession of the title belt. The title remained inactive until 1993.|$|E
500|$|Officially, the {{recorded}} death toll {{of the first}} week of January 1923 was eight people (six black and two white). Historians disagree about this number. Some survivors' stories claim there may have been up to 27 black residents killed, and assert that newspapers did not report the total number of white deaths. Minnie Lee Langley, who was in the Carrier house siege, recalls that she stepped over many white bodies on the porch <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> house. [...] Several eyewitnesses claim to have seen a mass grave filled with black people; one remembers a plow brought from Cedar Key that covered 26 bodies.

500|$|The {{story begins}} when Antimony builds a robot to {{transport}} a mysterious shadow into Gillitie Wood, the forest outside Gunnerkrigg Court. Several chapters {{later in the}} comic, and apparently several months later in the story's timeline, the robot reappears on the bridge outside Gunnerkrigg Court; being controlled by a malevolent creature from Gillitie Wood, it pushes Antimony off the bridge when she goes out to it. [...] Antimony spends {{a night at the}} banks of the river below the bridge, and encounters a ghost, before she is rescued by Kat and taken back to the school. [...] Her brief time outside Gunnerkrigg Court, though, sets off a dispute between Gunnerkrigg Court and the Gillitie Wood. [...] Not long after Antimony's return, the Court is visited by Coyote, a god from the Gillitie Wood, and General Ysengrin, the being who caused the robot to attack Antimony at the bridge. [...] They express anger over the robot's visit to the forest, and over the damage Antimony caused <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> Court.|$|E

500|$|On 18 September 2016, it was {{announced}} that Babe would be written out of the series in 2017, having appeared on the show for three years. A show spokesperson recalled that before moving to Walford, Babe was [...] "seen coming and going from The Square with her own life" [...] and stated that she would [...] "still very much be in the wings" [...] and could [...] "cause aggro for the Carters." [...] Ian Sandwell of Digital Spy hoped that Babe's exit storyline would see her receive her [...] "just desserts" [...] as punishment for her [...] "despicable schemes", but believed that she would [...] "get away without getting a proper comeuppance." [...] The Metro ran a poll on their website to ask readers for their opinions on whether they would miss the character <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> show: 71% of people who answered said they would not miss her because she is [...] "awful", while the other 29% said they would miss her and agreed that [...] "she brought brilliant drama" [...] to the show.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} become the {{character}} of Dot Cotton, Brown is required to wear a wig to replicate Dot's 1950s [...] "Italian Boy" [...] hairstyle that has remained in a largely unchanged style since she first appeared in 1985. Although Brown now wears a wig, for many years the hair sported by Dot actually belonged to the actress. Brown has stated {{that as soon as}} Dot's hairpiece is on, she becomes the character. The unchanged style of Dot was deemed so important by the programme makers, that when Brown requested to have dental work carried out to improve her prominent front teeth, the producers refused to allow it, arguing that Dot could not afford expensive tooth capping. Brown was not permitted to alter her teeth until early 1991 when they became loose. Brown has indicated that she does not want Dot's style altered. She claimed in 2002 that Dot had the same coats in her wardrobe that she was given in 1985. The fur-collared coat Dot wears for special occasions was donated by the character Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) in 1988 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> serial. Brown commented, [...] "I like the older clothes [...] I don't want new clothes, I'm happy the way she is. She thinks she looks really smart. She's got a terrible opinion of herself that woman!" ...|$|E
500|$|Although the rioting {{was widely}} {{reported}} around the United States at the time, few official records documented the event. Survivors, their descendants, and the perpetrators remained silent about Rosewood for decades. Sixty {{years after the}} rioting, the story of Rosewood was revived in major media when several journalists covered it in the early 1980s. Survivors and their descendants organized to sue the state for having failed to protect Rosewood's black community. In 1993, the Florida Legislature commissioned {{a report on the}} massacre. As a result of the findings, Florida became the first U.S. state to compensate survivors and their descendants for damages incurred because of racial violence. The incident {{was the subject of a}} 1997 feature film directed by John Singleton. In 2004, the state designated the site of Rosewood as a Florida Heritage Landmark.
