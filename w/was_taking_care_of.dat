5|$|Babcock {{was married}} twice, first to Elsie, then to Dorothy, a woman nearly thirty {{years his junior}} whom he met when she <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> his first wife while she was dying. Babcock had one son (Jack Jr.) and one {{daughter}} (Sandra). One grandchild, Matt, was an army dentist in Iraq during the Iraq War. John and Dorothy resided in Spokane, Washington, where Babcock lived from 1932 until his death. Babcock {{was not the only}} centenarian in his family; his younger sister Lucy died in July 2007 at the age of 102.|$|E
5|$|Much of Van Rensselaer's {{early life}} is unknown to today's historians, though in March 1608 {{it has been}} {{recorded}} that he <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> some business of Van Bijler in Prague. It seems Van Bijler gradually retired from his business, leaving it in the control of Van Rensselaer. During his tenure {{at the helm of}} his uncle's business, Van Rensselaer proposed a merger with the firm of Jan van Wely, son of one of Van Bijler's sisters, who had an equally successful jewelry business. The firms combined under the name of Jan van Wely & Co. in February 1614. Van Rensselaer's name {{was not included in the}} name of the new company, since he contributed only one eighth of the investment capital, whereas van Wely contributed half (192,000 guilders). In 1616, van Wely was called on by Prince Maurice to meet at the Hague for a sale in jewels. He was murdered while waiting to meet with the Prince. The firm's contract stipulated that at the death of Jan van Wely, the remaining members of the firm should continue the partnership for another six years. Van Wely's murder, therefore, caused no change in the business, but it seems that at the expiration of that time, Van Rensselaer began again on his own account, founding Kiliaen van Rensselaer & Co. with partner Jacques I'Hermite.|$|E
5|$|Susan discovers her tutor, John Bradley, {{is behind}} the threats. When Susan asks John why he {{threatened}} her, he tells her {{she gave him a}} bad mark when he was a student teacher. Susan supports Libby when she learns that Steph had sex with Dan, and is carrying his child. Susan is angry with Toadie when she discovers he helped Steph cover up the lie. When Paul is pushed off the Lassiter's Hotel mezzanine, Susan begins investigating who is responsible, and makes Diana Marshall (Jane Badler) her prime suspect. Susan then receives text messages from an anonymous person, telling her that Diana was not the one who pushed Paul. Rebecca confesses to Susan that she pushed Paul and Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) gave her a false alibi. Susan persuades Kate to go to the police. Susan is devastated when Ringo dies and she feels guilty because she <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> him for Prue (Penny Cook), Ringo's mother.

25|$|In 1990, Felt {{moved to}} Santa Rosa, California, from Alexandria, Virginia, his home since the 1970s. In 1992, {{he bought a}} house in Santa Rosa and after that lived with his {{daughter}} Joan Felt. He suffered a stroke before 1999, reported Ronald Kessler in his book The Bureau. According to Kessler's book, in the summer of 1999, Woodward showed up unexpectedly at the home of Felt's daughter and took him to lunch. Joan Felt, who <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> him at her home, told Kessler her father greeted Woodward like an old friend, and their mysterious meeting appeared {{to be more of a}} celebration than an interview.|$|E

25|$|Lady Cripps {{returned}} to England with her sick grandson. Just before Christmas 1962, Joe {{was released from}} prison and allowed to return to legal practice. The anxieties of the final years of the Nkrumah regime were relieved in 1966, by the coup that ousted Nkrumah. In the years that followed, as her children were abroad at boarding schools and universities, and her husband was active once more in Ghanaian politics and as an ambassador for the nation, she stayed mostly in Kumasi, providing the base from which he could travel out into the world, secure in the knowledge that Peggy <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> things on the home front. She kept an eye on the properties he had inherited from his grand-uncle. Despite her family's extensive political involvements, Peggy herself was not particularly interested in party politics. She supported her husband, of course. But her own contributions were through the wide range of social work she engaged in. Having learned Twi, the language of the Asante, she became interested in and knowledgeable about Akan art and folklore, as she acquired a major goldweight collection, began collecting and translating proverbs, and learned Ananse stories, many of them from her husband. For three decades, a visit to her house and her goldweight collection was {{one of the highlights of}} a visit to Ashanti for visitors interested in its art.|$|E

2500|$|Williams {{was born}} (with his twin sister Cassandra) in San Diego, California, to 19-year-old Sandy Williams and her husband, 18-year-old Errick Williams. He was born inside of Jack Murphy Stadium, also {{referred}} to as [...] "the Murph" [...] by San Diegans. Growing up middle class, his parents divorced in 1983 and Williams, at the age of five, <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> his sisters by putting them to bed and even cooking for them. Perhaps due to his broken home and the fact that his father was gone at such an early age, Williams suffered from anger issues that eventually led his mother to send him to counseling. He also struggled academically, despite a test he took as a six-year-old which revealed that he had the intelligence of someone twice his age. Williams himself once said, [...] "I was always very bright, but not necessarily a hard worker. I think I was in eighth grade when I became really focused as a student and started getting good grades." [...] By high school Williams was an honor roll student and was named to the San Diego Union-Tribune All-Academic team.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{days after}} Shannan Gilbert's disappearance, Shannan Gilbert's mother, Mari Gilbert, {{received}} a phone call from Dr. Peter Hackett. Hackett was an Oak Beach resident and a neighbor of Joseph Brewer at the time. In the phone call, Hackett allegedly told Mari Gilbert that he <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> Shannan, and that he [...] "ran a home for wayward girls." [...] Five days after Gilbert's disappearance, Hackett made another phone call to Shannan's mother. Hackett vehemently denied ever coming into contact with Shannan, or ever making the phone calls to her mother. However, phone records later confirmed that Peter Hackett called Mari Gilbert twice following Shannan's disappearance. The marshy area where Shannan's remains were eventually found was also noted to be close in proximity to Hackett's backyard. Subsequently, the Gilbert family filed a wrongful death suit against Hackett in November 2012, claiming that he took Shannan into his home that morning and administered drugs to her, facilitating her death. However, it was later revealed that Hackett had a history of inserting himself into, or exaggerating his role in certain major events. This included the embellishment of his role in the investigation of TWA Flight 800. Police also noted that Hackett's wife and two children were home on the night of Shannan Gilbert's disappearance, and would have had to have been aware of or complacent in any foul play that went on that night. Police later ruled out Dr. Peter Hackett as a suspect in the deaths of Shannan Gilbert and the other victims found in the area.|$|E
