5|$|Both the NDH {{forces and}} Drljević had reasons for ensnaring Đurišić. The NDH forces <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> the mass terror {{committed}} by Đurišić on the Muslim population in Sandžak and south-eastern Bosnia. Drljević {{was opposed to}} Đurišić's support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro, which ran counter to Drljević's separatism.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of refugees <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> economic concerns and sought to improve their living conditions and opportunities by migrating to the West. Events such as the crushing of the 1953 uprising, the imposition of collectivisation and East Germany's final economic crisis in the late 1980s prompted surges {{in the number of}} escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|During the {{economic}} {{expansion of the}} 1830s, Irish and German immigration to St. Louis increased substantially. In particular, the writings of Gottfried Duden encouraged German immigration. Many Irish <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> the Irish potato famine of 1845–1846 and the failed Irish uprising of 1848. Other Irish settlers came because of its reputation as a Catholic city.|$|E

5|$|Al-Baqi cemetery, {{the oldest}} {{and one of the}} two most {{important}} Islamic graveyards located in Medina, Saudi Arabia, was demolished in 1806 and, following reconstruction in the mid-19th century, was destroyed again in 1925 or 1926. An alliance of the House of Saud, and the followers of the Wahhabi movement known as the Emirate of Diriyah, carried out the first demolition. The Sultanate of Nejd, also ruled by the House of Saud and followers of Wahhabism, carried out the second. In both cases, the actors <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, which prohibits the building of monuments on graves.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{voted in}} the United Nations condemning the human rights {{violations}} in Cuba, but refused to send military forces to Afghanistan and Iraq. Still, Duhalde proposed to send peacekeeping troops, and strongly criticized the regime of Saddam Hussein and international terrorism. Duhalde increased his criticism of the United States during {{the final years of}} his government, and changed the vote in relation to Cuba to an abstention. Those changes <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> the upcoming 2003 elections. Menem, who was running for a third term as president, supported the vote condemning Cuba and the military aid to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his service}} in Korea, Mitchell was posted in Britain, but in late 1957, he {{returned}} to the Argylls as a company commander with the 1st Battalion, and was posted to Cyprus. At the time, the Cyprus Emergency was in full swing. Mitchell was placed in charge of the coastal towns of Paphos and Ktima, where his men engaged in counter-insurgency operations against EOKA guerrillas. They faced both conventional EOKA raids and forest fires deliberately lit by EOKA fighters and local villagers who <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> the money they would receive to fight them.|$|E

5|$|Playing with Fire {{became the}} top seller on Amazon.ca {{within a week}} of its release, and Fleury stated that he had been {{contacted}} by several sexual abuse victims who <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> his book to seek help. He also revealed that he was contemplating a criminal complaint against James, and had begun volunteering with an organization dedicated to helping male sexual abuse victims. Fleury was surprised that his story became the top-selling non-fiction book in Canada; without help, {{he and his wife were}} unable to keep up with the mail they were receiving. It is the second book about Fleury's life, following Fury, released in 1997, which did not discuss many of the problems he was facing at the time.|$|E
5|$|The feminist, human rights, peace, civil rights, and anti-psychiatry {{movements}} {{were some of}} Millett's principal causes. Her books <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> her activism, such as woman's rights and mental health reform, and several were autobiographical memoirs that explored her sexuality, mental health, and relationships. In the 1960s and 1970s, Millett taught at Waseda University, Bryn Mawr College, Barnard College, and the University of California, Berkeley. Some of her later written works are The Politics of Cruelty (1994), about state-sanctioned torture in many countries, and Mother Millett (2001), a book about {{her relationship with her}} mother. Between 2011 and 2013, she won the Lambda Pioneer Award for Literature, received Yoko Ono's Courage Award for the Arts, and was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|The {{first people}} {{to write about the}} May Revolution were {{participants}} who wrote memoirs, biographies and diaries. However, their works <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> purposes other than historiographic ones, such as to explain the reasons for their actions, clean their public images, or express their support or rejection of the public figures and ideas of the time. For example, Manuel Moreno wrote the biography of his brother Mariano as propaganda for the revolutions in Europe, and Cornelio Saavedra wrote his autobiography at a moment when his image was highly questioned, to justify himself to his sons.|$|E

5|$|Vietnamese and French {{historians have}} {{fiercely}} debated Định's choice {{to disregard the}} treaty. The effectiveness of Định's insurgency led French officials to claim that Tự Đức was secretly assisting him, thereby violating the treaty, a pretext the French used to seize three more provinces in 1867. Vietnamese records dispute this, contending that Tự Đức attempted to ensure Định's compliance with the treaty. Định's defiance of the emperor has led historians to debate whether his actions <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> {{a rejection of the}} monarch's authority or whether he disobeyed in an attempt to help Tự Đức. Định remains widely respected among Vietnamese of all political persuasions. During the Vietnam War, communist historians sought to portray the Việt Cộng as Định's modern successor.|$|E
5|$|According to Philip Van Tricht, Theodore's actions <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> several factors, {{which led}} him to regard Peter {{as a threat to}} himself and his principality. Peter's attempt to return Dyrrhachium to Venice, even if it had failed for the moment, boded ill for the future. Peter's {{recognition}} of the rights of Demetrius' half-brother William VI of Montferrat over Thessalonica opened the way for William to take power there, and Theodore was loath to see Thessalonica—whose rulers still claimed suzerainty over Epirus—strengthened, particularly given the presence of his exiled nephew Michael II in the court of the Latin Principality of Achaea. At the same time, Theodore and his court resented the increased papal interference in Greek affairs, especially {{in the aftermath of the}} mission of Cardinal Pelagius, the previous papal legate to Constantinople, whose actions had deepened the rift between Greeks and Latins further.|$|E
5|$|The Ustaše {{gathered}} {{them in a}} field alongside 5,000 other Chetnik {{prisoners and}} arranged for Drljević and his followers to select 150 Chetnik officers and non-combatant intellectuals for execution. Đurišić, Baćović, Vasić and Ostojić were amongst those selected. They {{and the others were}} loaded onto boats by the Ustaše and taken across the Sava River, where they were killed either in the Jasenovac concentration camp itself or in a nearby marsh. Both the NDH forces and Drljević had reasons for ensnaring Đurišić.

Left without a leader, the majority of Đurišić's men were integrated into Drljević's Montenegrin National Army and withdrew with him towards the Austrian border.|$|E

5|$|Following this {{defeat and}} the {{defection}} {{of one of}} his sub-units to Drljević, Đurišić was induced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the NDH forces about the further movement of his Chetniks towards Slovenia. However, this {{appears to have been a}} trap, as he was attacked and captured by them on his way to the meeting. According to Tomasevich, exactly what occurred after his capture is not clear, but Baćović, Đurišić, Vasić and Ostojić were subsequently killed, along with some Serbian Orthodox priests and others. According to some sources, on 20 April, Đurišić, Baćović, Vasić and Ostojić were taken to the Stara Gradiška prison, near Jasenovac. The Ustaše gathered them in a field alongside 5,000 other Chetnik prisoners and arranged for Drljević and his followers to select 150 Chetnik officers and non-combatant intellectuals for execution. Đurišić, Baćović, Vasić and Ostojić were amongst those selected. They and the others were loaded onto boats by the Ustaše and taken across the Sava River, never to be seen again. It is reported that they were killed either in the Jasenovac concentration camp itself, or in a marsh in its vicinity. The website of the Jasenovac Memorial Site lists Baćović as having been killed at the camp by the Ustaše in 1945. Both the NDH forces and Drljević had reasons for ensnaring Đurišić.

5|$|Lord Chancellor Gardiner and the House of Commons unsuccessfully petitioned her to {{consider}} marrying an Englishman, fearing that England would {{be relegated to}} a dependency of the Habsburgs. The marriage was unpopular with the English; Gardiner and his allies opposed it {{on the basis of}} patriotism, while Protestants <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> a fear of Catholicism. When Mary insisted on marrying Philip, insurrections broke out. Thomas Wyatt the younger led a force from Kent to depose Mary in favour of Elizabeth, as part of a wider conspiracy now known as Wyatt's rebellion, which also involved the Duke of Suffolk, the father of Lady Jane. Mary declared publicly that she would summon Parliament to discuss the marriage, and if Parliament decided that the marriage was not to the advantage of the kingdom, she would refrain from pursuing it. On reaching London, Wyatt was defeated and captured. Wyatt, the Duke of Suffolk, his daughter Lady Jane, and her husband Guildford Dudley were executed. Courtenay, who was implicated in the plot, was imprisoned, and then exiled. Elizabeth, though protesting her innocence in the Wyatt affair, was imprisoned in the Tower of London for two months, then was put under house arrest at Woodstock Palace.|$|E

5|$|To an extent, the Arab–Khazar wars {{were also}} {{linked to the}} {{struggle}} of the Caliphate against the Byzantine Empire along the eastern fringes of Asia Minor, a theatre of war which adjoined the Caucasus. The Byzantine emperors pursued close relations with the Khazars, which amounted to a virtual alliance {{for most of the}} period in question, including such exceptional acts as the marriage of emperor Justinian II (r. 685–695; 705–711) to a Khazar princess in 705. The possibility of the Khazars linking up with the Byzantines through Armenia was a grave threat to the Caliphate, especially given its proximity to the Umayyad metropolitan province of Syria. This did not materialize, and Armenia was left largely quiet, with the Umayyads granting it wide-ranging autonomy and the Byzantines likewise refraining from active campaigning there. Indeed, given the common threat posed by the Khazar raids, the Umayyads found the Armenians (and the neighbouring Georgians) willing allies against the Khazars. Although some Byzantinists, notably Dimitri Obolensky, suggested that the Arab–Khazar wars <b>were</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> a Muslim desire to outflank the Byzantine defences from the north, this idea is not borne out by the limited nature of the conflict until the 720s. It is more probable that the Byzantines encouraged the Khazars to attack the Caliphate to relieve the mounting pressure on their own eastern frontier in the early 8th century, as indeed they profited considerably from the diversion of the Muslim armies northwards in the 720s and 730s, resulting in another alliance through marriage, between the future emperor Constantine V (r. 741–775) and the Khazar princess Tzitzak in 733.|$|E
