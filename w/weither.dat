The biological material was represented by 16 adult rabbit females and 10 adult males, with the average body weight of 7 kg, raised in semi-intensive system. There have been performed the following body measurements: oblique and horizontal length of the trunk, the length of thorax, the length of head, the length of ears, of neck, and of tail, the height at <b>weithers</b> and rump, the height of thorax and stern, the width of chest, of thorax, of rump at hip and ischia, the wide width of forehead, the thoracic circumference and the circumference of shin. Giant German Ram males have registered higher values in the body size index, in the pelvic-thoracic index, and in the rump angle index compared to females from the same breed, which have registered higher values in the index of transverse body size, in the index of massiveness, in the pelvic-thoracic index, and in the cephalic index...|$|R

For the first song, Lucassen wanted Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden; however due to Dickinsons busy schedule, it was unsure {{until the very}} last moment <b>weither</b> or not if he could come to Lucassens studio and record it. As Damian Wilson came into Lucassens studio to provide vocals in [...] "And the Druids Turn to Stone" [...] for Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer, Lucassen had the idea of {{recording}} a version of [...] "Into the Black Hole" [...] with Wilson, in case Dickinson {{would turn out to}} be unavailable. Dickinson was featured on the album version of the song, while the version present on Ayreonauts Only is the one with Wilson, and still features Lana Lanes backing vocals. For two other songs, Lucassen asked his friends Robert Soeterboek and Ian Parry (who had previously sung for him in Ayreon and Vengeance respectively) to provide guide vocals for the songs actual singers, respectively Timo Kotipelto and Fabio Lione; those guide vocals are the ones used in Ayreonauts Only.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an information retrieval model on XML documents based on tree matching. Queries and documents {{are represented by}} extended trees. An extended tree is built starting from the original tree, with additional weighted virtual links between each node and its indirect descendants allowing to directly reach each descendant. Therefore only one level separates between each node and its indirect descendants. This allows to compare the user query and the document with flexibility and {{with respect to the}} structural constraints of the query. The content of each node is very important to decide <b>weither</b> a document element is relevant or not, thus the content should be taken into account in the retrieval process. We separate between the structure-based and the content-based retrieval processes. The content-based score of each node is commonly based on the well-known Tf × Idf criteria. In this paper, we compare between this criteria and another one we call Tf × Ief. The comparison is based on some experiments into a dataset provided by INEX 1 to show the effectiveness of our approach on one hand and those of both weighting functions on the other...|$|E
40|$|In two experiments, {{participants}} {{were presented with}} pictures of different foods (A, B, C, D, X,) and learned which combinations resulted in an allergic reaction in a fictitious patient, MrX. In Problem 1, when Aor B (but not Cor D) was combined with food Xan allergic reaction occurred, and when C or D(but not A or B) was combined with Y an allergic reaction occurred. In Experiment 1, participants also received Problem 2 in which A, B, C, and Dinteracted with foods V and <b>Weither</b> {{in the same way}} as X and Y, respectively, or in a different way. Participants performed more proficiently in the former than in the latter condition. In Experiment 2, after training on Problem 1, participants judged whether or not novel combinations of foods (e. g., AB, CD, AD, CB) would cause an allergic reaction in MrX. They were no more likely to indicate that ABor CD would cause an allergic reaction than AD or CB, but made their judgements more rapidly and with greater confidence on AB and CDtrials than on ADand CB trials. These results (1) indicate that shared representations come to be addressed by the components of similar compounds (e. g., AX and BX) that have predicted the same outcome (an allergic reaction), and (2) are inconsistent with standard, associative theories of learning, but (3) are consistent with findings from nonhuman animals and with a connectionist interpretation of these findings...|$|E
40|$|The {{structures}} of both oxidized (HPox) and reduced (HPred) high-potential iron protein and of oxidized ferredoxin (Fdox) have been partially refined at 2. 0 -Å resolution by methods {{similar to those}} applied to the protein rubredoxin [Watenpaugh, K. D., Sieker, L. C., Herriott, J. R. & Jensen, L. H. (1971) Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 36, 359 - 367]. Average bond lengths and angles in the HPred and Fdox Fe 4 S 4 * clusters are the same to within the root-mean square (rms) deviation of each mean value. A preliminary comparison of the two HiPIP oxidation states indicates that the HPox cluster is geometrically similar to the HPred cluster, {{but that it is}} smaller by 0. 1 - 0. 2 Å in certain dimensions. The HiPIP and ferredoxin cluster geometry is also nearly identical to that reported recently for a synthetic analog [Herskovitz, T., Averill, B. A., Holm, R. A., Ibers, J. A., Phillips, W. D. & <b>Weither,</b> J. F. (1972) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 69, 2437 - 2441]. An apparent paradox presented by the large difference between the HiPIP and ferredoxin electrode potentials can be resolved by the assumption that the Fe 4 S 4 * cluster has not two but three oxidation states. The fully oxidized (HPox) and fully reduced (Fdred) clusters are paramagnetic, and the intermediate state is spin-paired [Tsibris, J. C. M. and Woody, R. W. (1970) Coord. Chem. Rev. 5, 417 - 458]. This hypothesis is supported by structural and spectroscopic evidence that the “paired-spin” state exists in both HPred and Fdox...|$|E
