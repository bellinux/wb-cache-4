In the United States and many other areas of the world the most common bacteria present is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Rarely, parasites can cause abscesses; this is more common in the developing world. Diagnosis of a skin abscess is usually made based on <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like, and is confirmed by cutting it open. Ultrasound imaging may be useful in cases in which the diagnosis is not clear. In abscesses around the anus, computer tomography (CT) may be important to look for deeper infection.|$|E

The main point of the law was to not only set down regulations {{on how to make}} the Chinese flag, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like, where it can be flown and how it can be flown. The law also stresses that the national flag is [...] "the symbol and hallmark of the People's Republic of China" [...] and that everyone [...] "shall respect and care for the National Flag." ...|$|E

According to Matt Groening, the baritone saxophone was chosen because he found the thought of an eight-year-old girl playing it amusing. He added, [...] "But she doesn't always play a baritone sax because the animators don't know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like, so it changes shape and color from show to show." [...] One of the hallmarks of the show's opening sequence is a brief solo Lisa plays on her saxophone after being thrown out of music class.

[...] Despite this statement, on Saturday, April 25, 2015, Bush criticized President Barack Obama {{at a meeting of the}} Republican Jewish Coalition at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. Bush criticized Obama's handling of Iran, specifically with respect to sanctions and a nuclear deal, saying: [...] "You think the Middle East is chaotic now?

[...] TIME magazine's Richard Corliss wrote the film's [...] "noble intent is to implant one man's vision {{in the mind of}} a vast audience ... The idea of moviegoing as communal dreaming is a century old. With Inception, viewers have a chance to see that notion get a state-of-the-art update."

However, Charlotte Wilder, a writer on USA Todays sports column For The Win, was unimpressed by Vinicius's design, stating, [...] "Whoever was in charge of coming up with this creature of the huge hands and feet did exactly <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like, which is mash up a bunch of animals, video game characters, and cartoons, stuff it with some synthetic filling, and call it day." [...] Robert John Young, Professor of Wildlife Conservation at the University of Salford, criticized Rio 2016 for failing to capitalize on environmental protection by [...] "inventing" [...] mascots, rather than using actual animal species.

500|$|Scott {{chose not}} to show the full Alien {{for most of the}} film, keeping most of its body in shadow {{in order to create a}} sense of terror and heighten suspense. The {{audience}} could thus project their own fears into imagining what the rest of the creature might look like: [...] "Every movement is going to be very slow, very graceful, and the Alien will alter shape so you never really know exactly what he looks like." [...] The Alien has been referred to as [...] "one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted. Roger Ebert remarked that [...] "Alien uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never know quite <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like or what it can do...The first time we get a good look at the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt). It is unmistakably phallic in shape, and the critic Tim Dirks mentions its 'open, dripping vaginal mouth.|$|E
500|$|However, the {{commonly}} reported {{statement that the}} action scenes are continuous shots is not entirely true. [...] Visual effects supervisor Frazer Churchill explains that the effects team had to [...] "combine several takes to create impossibly long shots", where their job was to [...] "create {{the illusion of a}} continuous camera move." [...] Once the team was able to create a [...] "seamless blend", they would {{move on to the next}} shot. [...] These techniques were important for three continuous shots: the coffee shop explosion in the opening shot, the car ambush, and the battlefield scene. [...] The coffee shop scene was composed of [...] "two different takes shot over two consecutive days"; the car ambush was shot in [...] "six sections and at four different locations over one week and required five seamless digital transitions"; and the battlefield scene [...] "was captured in five separate takes over two locations". Churchill and the Double Negative team created over 160 of these types of effects for the film. [...] In an interview with Variety, Cuarón acknowledged this nature of the [...] "single-shot" [...] action sequences: [...] "Maybe I'm spilling a big secret, but sometimes it's more than <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like. The important thing is how you blend everything and how you keep the perception of a fluid choreography through all of these different pieces." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{voice of}} a guest at the tanning-party which Stewie is hosting was {{provided}} by Mike Barker. David A. Goodman comments on the DVD commentary that [...] "It's nice to hear Mike Barker back on Family Guy.," [...] as Barker had performed multiple voices of characters in previous episodes. Peter asking [...] "I'm going to prison, aren't I?" [...] when hiding in the tree after beating up Chris's bully caused {{a little bit of}} trouble for the show, though it was never edited when aired on TV. A sketch had been created showing Brian falling asleep when watching Late Night with Bib Fortuna while Stewie was still in the tanning booth, but it did not seem good enough to air, so it was never broadcast. When Stewie is being sprayed by Brian with sun-screen, Ralph Furley enters the room and mistakenly thinks he sees Brian ejaculating on Stewie. The cream was originally intended to keep squirting out of the bottle as if Brian were continuing to ejaculate despite Mr. Furley's presence, but the animation didn't look right and was removed. MacFarlane comments that he was amazed that broadcasting standards allowed them to get away with the scene, even though Brian's line, [...] "This isn't <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like" [...] was edited to keep the ejaculation illusion from being blatant (the TV version goes from Mr. Furley yelling, [...] "Brian" [...] and Brian reacting to Mr. Furley running out and saying, [...] "Never mind, I'll come back later!"). A deleted scene was made and designed to happen directly after Peter sickens Meg by farting in her face in which Peter steals Chris's lunch money and runs for the bus. The gag showing Dick Cheney as a Wal-Mart greeter had Cheney's greeting, [...] "Go fuck yourself" [...] bleeped out on TV, but not DVD. Peter falling to the floor after being pushed away from hitting Randy by Chris was very difficult to do, as it is difficult to do slow-motion in animation. The DVD version includes an extra scene in the car, in which Peter shows Chris how he looks like an anus by wearing a hoodie, pulling the hood on the drawstring tight around his mouth, and pushing a chocolate candy bar out of the hole to simulate defecation.|$|E

2500|$|Bordeaux {{had to wait}} {{three years}} to get their revenge {{in one of the}} dirtiest finals, in which the whistle was held by a very quiet and blasé Englishman, Billy Williams (who, four years later was to get the English RFU to buy some land for Twickenham). Kicks in the shins succeeded blows in the face. Spectators joined in and booed the kickers in a very poor and sad match. A {{reporter}} appalled at what he saw commented: [...] "I’ve never seen thug fights in the seediest parts of town, but that is probably <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like.” Bordeaux won the next three finals, all against Stade. The rivalry was enhanced by the huge number of France players on the pitch. When France battled New Zealand for its first ever international match in 1906, it had 5 Stade Français and 4 Stade Bordelais players, the highest tallies for any club.

2500|$|Miller also {{researched}} how troublesome {{children were}} treated at the Tavistock Clinic, where imitation {{is often used}} during therapy; [...] "there are ways in which a skilful therapist will gently mock a child out of a tantrum by giving an amusing imitation of the tantrum immediately after it's happened. The child then has a mirror held up to it and is capable of seeing <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> like to others." [...] In his review of the adaptation for the Financial Times, Chris Dunkley referred to this issue, calling Cleese's Petruchio [...] "an eccentrically pragmatic social worker using the wayward client's own doubtful habits to calm her down." [...] Actress Sarah Badel had a similar conception of the psychology behind the production. She constructed an [...] "imaginary biography" [...] for Katherina, arguing [...] "She's a woman of such passion [...] a woman of such enormous capacity for love {{that the only way}} she could be happy is to find a man of equal capacity. Therefore she's mad for lack of love [...] he feigns madness, she is teetering on the edge of it. Petruchio is the only man who shows her what she's like." [...] In this reading of the play, the production was at least partially based on Miller's own 1972 Chichester Festival stage production starring Joan Plowright and Anthony Hopkins.|$|E
