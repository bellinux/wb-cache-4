The Sega CEO at the time, Tom Kalinske, took the proposal to Sega's Board of Directors in Tokyo, who promptly vetoed the idea. Kalinske, in a 2013 interview recalled them saying [...] "that’s a stupid idea, Sony doesn't know how to make hardware. They don’t know how to make software either. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to do this?". This prompted Sony into halting their research, but ultimately the company decided to use what it had developed so far with both Nintendo and Sega to make it into a complete console based upon the Super Famicom. As a result, Nintendo filed a lawsuit claiming breach of contract and attempted, in US federal court, to obtain an injunction against the release of what was originally christened the [...] "Play Station", on the grounds that Nintendo owned the name. The federal judge presiding over the case denied the injunction and, in October 1991, the first incarnation of the aforementioned brand new game system was revealed. However, it is theorised that only 200 or so of these machines were ever produced.|$|E

It is, of course, our objective over time to largely eliminate most of these wasteful accounting processes, but at the earlier stages of lean change we are content to improve the processes, provide learning to the finance people, and free up their time for the more significant lean changes in the future.|$|R

40|$|A precise {{definition}} {{of what constitutes a}} community in networks has remained elusive. Consequently, network scientists have compared community detection algorithms on benchmark networks with a particular form of community structure and classified them based on the mathematical techniques they employ. However, this comparison can be misleading because apparent similarities in their mathematical machinery can disguise different reasons for <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to employ community detection in the first place. Here we provide a focused review of these different motivations that underpin community detection.

40|$|In retail, {{there are}} {{predictable}} yet dramatic time-dependent patterns in customer behavior, such as periodic {{changes in the}} number of visitors, or increases in visitors just before major holidays. The current paradigm of multi-armed bandit analysis does not take these known patterns into account. This means that for applications in retail, where prices are fixed for periods of time, current bandit algorithms will not suffice. This work provides a remedy that takes the time-dependent patterns into account, and we show how this remedy is implemented in the UCB and ϵ-greedy methods and we introduce a new policy called the variable arm pool method. In the corrected methods, exploitation (greed) is regulated over time, so that more exploitation occurs during higher reward periods, and more exploration occurs in periods of low reward. In order to understand why regret is reduced with the corrected methods, we present a set of bounds that provide insight into <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to exploit during periods of high reward, and discuss the impact on regret. Our proposed methods perform well in experiments, and were inspired by a high-scoring entry in the Exploration and Exploitation 3 contest using data from Yahoo! Front Page.

40|$|The {{methodology}} of any domain depends, first, on clarifying {{what types of}} object are being researched – indeed can exist – in that domain: that is, on clarifying the ontology of that domain. The ontology of social media might seem wholly unproblematic: social media sites are certainly infrastructures with considerable, even massive, presence in our lives, {{the focus of our}} everyday habits of checking and updating, circulating and sharing. When 1. 5 billion people are active monthly users of one leading social media platform alone (Facebook), then the ‘object’ of study is hardly trivial. But what type of object are we studying exactly? Again from one point of view, the question seems straightforward: Facebook, Twitter, and other sites of social media activity are platforms (Gillespie, 2010), where social activity is supported generally by commercial operations. 1 The facts of such platforms – their design and other features – are important. But in this chapter <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to go beyond the platform ‘surface’ and ask a different ontological question: what are social media from a sociological point of view? Or, more precisely, in what sense are ‘social media’ actually ‘social’, as opposed to merely being outputs labelled as ‘social’? And, running behind that question, how should we interpret the related epistemological claims, made by various actors every day, that ‘social media’ provide evidence of ‘the social’? Those questions, it turns out, are far from straightforward, yet we cannot advance far in the study of social media without answering them. The answers will shape <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to spend our time studying social media at all rather than some other object...|$|R
