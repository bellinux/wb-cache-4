It had been booked in, that they were coming in to record their next single, and write it, with us. It was at Whitfield Street Studios and there was going to be an MTV crew there filming them as they did this, which there was. <b>Well,</b> <b>how</b> on earth can you possibly do this?

25|$|Because the tax did not vary, the {{treasury}} could estimate fairly <b>well</b> <b>how</b> much {{they were going}} to make in revenue for the year. Prior to Khosrow's tax reforms, taxes were collected based on the yield that the land had produced. This system was changed to one which calculated and averaged taxation based on the water rights for each piece of property. Lands which grew date palms and olive trees used a slightly different method of taxation based on the amount of producing trees that the land contained. These tax reforms of Khosrow were the stepping stone which enabled subsequent reforms in the bureaucracy and the military to take place.|$|E

25|$|The evangelical revelation {{contains}} the truth on the violence, available for two thousand years, Girard tells us. Has it {{put an end}} to the sacrificial order based on violence in the society that has claimed the gospel text as its own religious text? No, he replies, since in order for a truth to have an impact it must find a receptive listener, and people do not change that quickly. The gospel text has instead acted as a ferment that brings about the decomposition of the sacrificial order. While medieval Europe showed the face of a sacrificial society that still knew very <b>well</b> <b>how</b> to despise and ignore its victims, nonetheless the efficacy of sacrificial violence has never stopped decreasing, in the measure that ignorance receded. Here Girard sees the principle of the uniqueness and of the transformations of the Western society whose destiny today is one with that of human society as a whole.|$|E

She said the episode shows [...] "the ludicrous nature of, you know, {{what we do}} in a lot of things. The kids news with Bart and Lisa: I mean, you see them do really stupid stories about the news, and 'news you can use,' and 'how to get rid of your sheets when you wet them.' I mean, people really do stories like that." [...] Steven Keslowitz writes in his book The World According to the Simpsons that the episode showcases the fact that [...] "the viewing of attractive newscasters and the use of persuasive tones of voice often do {{have an impact on the}} minds of many intelligent members of American society." ...|$|E

500|$|It {{is likely}} that the {{composition}} and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that [...] "I know only too <b>well</b> <b>how</b> the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing." [...] By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word [...] "Victorian" [...] had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) {{was one of the few}} 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Candaules was {{exhibited}} Etty, needled by repeated {{attacks from}} the press on his supposed tastelessness, indecency and lack of creativity, decided to produce an explicitly moral piece. The result was his 1832 The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate, which was {{seen by many as}} a renunciation of his earlier, more openly sensual works. Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but from 1832 onwards made conscious efforts to reflect moral lessons. Despite this he continued to be regarded as a pornographer by many, long after his death in 1849; as late as 1882 Vanity Fair was able to comment that [...] "I know only too <b>well</b> <b>how</b> the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing." ...|$|E
500|$|Offa died on 29 July 796, and may {{be buried}} in Bedford, {{though it is not}} clear that the [...] "Bedeford" [...] named in that charter was {{actually}} Bedford. He was succeeded by his son, Ecgfrith of Mercia, but according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle Ecgfrith died after a reign of only 141 days. A letter written by Alcuin in 797 to a Mercian ealdorman named Osbert makes it apparent that Offa had gone to great lengths to ensure that his son Ecgfrith would succeed him. Alcuin's opinion is that Ecgfrith [...] "has not died for his own sins; but the vengeance for the blood his father shed to secure the kingdom has reached the son. For you know very <b>well</b> <b>how</b> much blood his father shed to secure the kingdom on his son." [...] It is apparent that in addition to Ecgfrith's consecration in 787, Offa had eliminated dynastic rivals. This seems to have backfired, from the dynastic point of view, as no close male relatives of Offa or Ecgfrith are recorded, and Coenwulf, Ecgfrith's successor, was only distantly related to Offa's line.|$|E

500|$|Several {{publications}} covering manga, anime, video games, {{and other}} media have praised and criticized the character. Tasha Robinson from SciFi.com remarked [...] "Kenshin's schizoid personal conflict between his ruthless-killer side and his country-bumpkin" [...] side was a perfect way to develop good stories {{which was one of}} the factors that made the series popular. Marco Oliveier from the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University said that the sakabatō symbolises Kenshin's oath not to kill again which has been found challenging by other warriors. Megan Lavey from Mania Entertainment highly praised Kenshin's characterization in the manga due to his seriousness as <b>well</b> <b>how</b> he intends to tell his friends his feelings contrasting some episodes from the anime where Kenshin is more comical. Lavey also highly praised the fight between Kenshin and Saito Hajime in the manga's seventh volume and Kenshin's killing intent displayed against his rival. Similarly, his first fight against Saito in the anime adaptation earned high praise by Anime News Network writer Mark A. Grey considering one of the best ones from the series. Entertainment Weekly found comical how whenever Kenshin is not fighting he is doing the laundry or cleans the dojo which brings a light tone that appealed the writer. T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews website criticized Kenshin's super deformed appearance in comedy scenes claiming it does not suit the context of the character or the series. Mania.com remarks that Kenshin has a [...] "smartass" [...] attitude in a review of volume 8; while they noted that is a common attitude in the anime that makes him look out-of-character. Anime News Network's Mike Crandol praised Kenshin for being a character that all people enjoy watching due to his comedy scenes. In About.com's Top 8 Anime Love Stories, Kenshin and Kaoru's relationship ranked 8th with Katherine Luther noting it is a [...] "classic romance." [...] Serdar Yegulalp from ThoughtCo. also listed the series as one of the [...] "Best anime romances" [...] with a bigger focus on Kenshin and Kaoru. Bamboo Dong from Anime News Network highly criticized Kenshin in the OVA's retelling of the Kyoto arc for lacking all the development he faced in both the manga and anime of this arc.|$|E
