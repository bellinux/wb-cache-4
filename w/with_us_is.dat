Shortly after the invasion of Iraq, he appeared on BBC Breakfast with Frost, speaking to presenter Peter Sissons about his role. He praised the military campaign and went on to talk about the challenges of rebuilding the country, saying [...] "I think in relative terms we are not as badly off as me might have feared", but agreed that there were insufficient [...] "people on the ground" [...] to ensure security {{in the aftermath of the}} invasion and removal of Saddam Hussein's government. He was later deeply critical of the planning made for post-war Iraq, and stated that he attempted to raise the issue of insufficient planning with politicians. However, he was never [...] "overly concerned" [...] by warnings from aid agencies of a massive humanitarian crisis in the aftermath of the invasion which, in the event, never materialised, though he admitted he had been too optimistic about the state of the Iraqi infrastructure. In the Breakfast with Frost interview, he drew an analogy with London, [...] "if you imagine going into London and every Ministry building is completely empty of furniture, completely empty of people, most of the windows blown out, just trying to find the people who work in those Ministries, the equivalent of the Home Office and [...] out who worked there, getting them back to work, beginning to pay their salaries which we're now beginning to do, and encouraging them to come back and work <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> bound to take a bit of time." ...|$|E

Levhari and Samuelson published a paper which began, 'We wish {{to make it clear}} for the record that the nonreswitching theorem associated <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> definitely false. We are grateful to Dr. Pasinetti...' (Levhari and Samuelson 1966). Leland Yeager and I jointly published a note acknowledging his earlier error and attempting to resolve the conflict between our theoretical perspectives. (Burmeister and Yeager, 1978).|$|E
2500|$|Once {{he was in}} power, János Kádár led {{an attack}} against revolutionaries. 21,600 mavericks (democrats, liberals, reformist Communists alike) were imprisoned, 13,000 interned, and 400 killed. But in the early 1960s, Kádár {{announced}} a new policy under the motto of [...] "He who is not against us is with us", a modification of Rákosi's statement, [...] "He who is not <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> against us". He declared a general amnesty, gradually curbed some of {{the excesses of the}} secret police, and introduced a relatively liberal cultural and economic course aimed at overcoming the post-1956 hostility towards him and his regime.|$|E

We feel and known that our {{condition}} and prospects are truly cheering, and to {{the friends of the}} cause we can say, Come on, not to join us, but to form other Associations; for we can not receive one-tenth of those who apply for admission. Nothing but the general principles of Association are lawful tender with us. Money will not buy admission for those who have no faith in the principles, but who merely believe, as most of our neighbors do, that we shall get rich... With our material, our means, and the principles of eternal truth on our side, success is neither doubtful nor surprising." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} with the Norwegian TV channel TVTromsø, Paul Waaktaar-Savoy expressed frustration over {{the time it took}} to produce new material with the band: [...] "The trouble <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>is</b> that we're never in sync. Right now, I'm eager to get going on the new album. I'm telling everybody that the new album is coming out next year and that it's going to be great. But the other two are of course just starting to get into their solo projects again and want to prioritize those for the time being." [...] Getting around to recording the follow-up to Analogue took four years due to the individual projects of the band members. Paul's band Savoy released Savoy Songbook Vol. 1, Magne released his second solo album A Dot of Black in the Blue of Your Bliss and Morten Harket released his second English-language solo album Letter from Egypt. Despite touring quite extensively between 2005–08, the focus of the group was not directed towards recording. The album ended up being recorded in {{a relatively short period of}} time (between January - May 2009) with Steve Osborne, Mark Saunders and Roland Spremberg producing.|$|E
