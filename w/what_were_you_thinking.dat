6000|$|... "For your age, Isobel," [...] I {{declared}} seriously, [...] "you {{are very}} nearly a practical person. You make {{me more than}} ever anxious for an answer to my last question. <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> of just now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{is asleep}} now,' said Mrs. Swancourt. 'She {{does not seem}} very well. Cousin Knight, <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> of? her tender brain won't bear cudgelling like your great head. You should have {{strictly}} forbidden her to play again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly I will explain, to Cathelineau and the others, {{the cause}} of your absence. But <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> of doing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking,</b> little fool?" [...] {{asked the}} Marquise peevishly, her fat face {{puckered}} into a hundred wrinkles of ill-humour.|$|R
6000|$|CATHERINE (interrupting him). My orders! Why should I order you {{to bring}} Captain Bluntschli's luggage out here? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> of, Nicola? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> of when I saw {{you with}} Marie? I won't {{have it for}} her sake, and I won't have it for mine, and I won't have it for your own. You had better go away for a while.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For Heaven's sake, dearest Elinor, {{do not let}} him {{paint the}} look which you now wear," [...] said her lover, smiling, though rather perplexed. [...] "There! it is passing away now; but when you spoke, you seemed frightened to death, and very sad besides. <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> of?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl {{flashed a}} quick glance at him. [...] "Well," [...] she rejoined, [...] "I suppose it does; but, after all, that is a {{question}} we need not discuss. <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> of so hard as you came along? You didn't see me until you almost stepped upon my dress." ...|$|E

6000|$|CATHERINE [energetically {{pulling him}} back]. No, no! Patiomkin! <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> of? [He falls like a log on the floor, {{apparently}} dead drunk.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There, I've settled it,' said Mrs. Garland. 'Anne, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> about? I {{have settled}} {{in my mind}} that it is all right.' ...|$|R
6000|$|There were in Powell's head {{no special}} words {{to fit the}} horror of his feelings. So he said--he had to say something, [...] "Good God! <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> of, Mr Smith, to try to..." [...] And then he left off. He dared not utter the awful word poison. Mr Smith stopped his prowl.|$|E
6000|$|I {{speak in}} sorrow of heart {{to those who}} must have known, loved, and revered Lady Byron, and ask them, Of <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> when you allowed a paper of so {{established}} literary rank as the 'Blackwood,' to present and earnestly recommend to our New World such a compendium of lies as the Guiccioli book? ...|$|E
6000|$|Bagshot {{was rather}} {{proud of his}} new {{quarters}} until my uncle called upon him. Up to then he felt assured he was doing right; had, indeed, not the faintest doubt in the matter until my uncle unsettled him. [...] "Nice carpet, Bagshot," [...] said my uncle, [...] "nice and soft. This chair certainly very comfortable. But what the mischief do you mean--you, with your pretence to culture--by hanging your dwelling with all those framed and glazed photograph and autograph dittoes?

6000|$|... "With {{submission}} to your superior judgment, my dear fellow, I think quite enough has happened already. The adventure will {{do very well}} as it stands now; more of {{it is more than}} I want." [...] He took another dram of whisky, and rambled on, between the puffs of his cigar, in his usual easy way. [...] "I've not got your fine imagination, old boy; and I hope the next thing that happens will be the appearance of the workmen's boat. I suspect that queer fancy of yours has been running away with you while you were down here all by yourself. Come, now, <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> of while I was up in the mizzen-top frightening the cows?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You think not! What did {{you mean}} then? <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> of when we were coming back in the {{carriage}} from Stamford,--when with your arms round me you swore that you loved me better than all the world? Is that true? Did you so swear?" [...] What a question {{for a man to}} have to answer! It was becoming clear to him that there was nothing for him but to endure and be silent. Even to this interview the gods would at last give an end. The hour would pass, though, alas, so slowly, and she could not expect that he should stand there to be rated much after the accustomed time for feeding. [...] "You acknowledge that, and do you dare to say that I had no right to tell my friends?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'What foolery is this?' demanded Sikes, {{grasping}} {{her by the}} arm, {{and shaking}} her roughly. 'What <b>is</b> it? <b>What</b> do <b>you</b> mean? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking</b> of?' ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{a segment}} of The Daily Show, Ed Helms showed a PDFA {{advertisement}} in which a stoned teenager takes out a gun and, not realizing that it is loaded, shoots his friend. At {{the end of the}} PSA Helms says, [...] "Obviously this is a very effective commercial... for gun control. Come on parents, <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking,</b> leaving a loaded gun around teenagers? Are you high or something?" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking?,</b> 2006, is a {{characteristic}} late {{work that was}} one of the artist’s favourites. It is a multi-faceted painting that combines a sophisticated layering of paint and the use of vibrant colours. The question posed by the painting could [...] "refer to friends who have passed away or people who have done stupid things and lived to regret it ... David was ever-present in his paintings. He observed human nature and used his observations as a source for his work ..." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking!?</b> What {{was going}} on in your mind!? Artistic integrity!? Where {{did you come up with}} that!? Youre not artistic and you have no integrity! You know, you really need some help! And a regular {{psychiatrist}} couldnt even help you! You need to go to, like, Vienna or something, you know what I mean? You need to get involved at the university level, like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you! Thats the kind of help you need! Not the once a week for eighty bucks, no! You need a TEAM! A team of psychiatrists working round the clock, thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like what they did with the Elephant Man! Thats what Im talking about, because thats the only way youre going to get better! Jerry Seinfeld (in character) ...|$|E

40|$|This article helps {{strengthen}} our comparative and theoretical understanding of lawyers as gatekeepers to justice {{by analyzing the}} screening practices of lawyers in a non-Western context. The explanation for Chinese lawyers’ aversion to representing workers with labor grievances focuses on their own working conditions, on the organization of their legal labor, and on their evaluations of the moral character of prospective clients. By linking the screening practices of Chinese lawyers to their socioeconomic insecurity and to popular stereotypes informing and legitimating their screening decisions, this article identifies institutional and cultural obstacles {{not only to the}} official justice system but also to cause lawyering. After establishing motives for screening clients, this article then demonstrates lawyers ’ screening methods: by defining legal reality in strategic and often misleading ways, lawyers use the law as a weapon against the interests of the individuals who seek their help. Male Lawyer 1 (L 1) : How could you have signed this [labor] contract? Were you scatterbrained? Female Client (C) : Yes, at the time, I signed it with my eyes shut. I didn’t read it at all. L 1 : Well, if you signed with your eyes shut you should face the consequences alone. <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>thinking?</b> C: Why would you ask something like this? L 1 : Are you divorced? Or is it possible you have other issues? You can’t let go of problems. In your everyday life, do you often get into arguments with people...|$|E
