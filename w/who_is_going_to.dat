5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea of <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.|$|E

Tom complains about a tramp begging outside their house. Later in the evening, Tom is home alone and Migg (Pemberton), the tramp, comes to his door, to return Tom's wallet. Tom rewards him with £40. Migg comes back later {{with a bottle of}} whiskey for Tom. Reluctantly, Tom invites Migg inside for a drink. Migg says he knew Charles Bukowski, whom Tom as an aspiring author idolises, and Tom warms to Migg as they drink.|$|E

5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Rosa, Cecil's love interest, had followed him and is extremely ill with a fever. Soon after this, Cecil and Rydia meet Tellah, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Damcyan Castle to retrieve his eloping daughter, Anna. However, Anna is killed when the Red Wings bomb the castle. Edward, Anna's lover and {{the prince of}} Damcyan, explains that the Red Wings' new commander, Golbez, did this to steal the Fire Crystal for Baron as they had stolen the Water Crystal from Mysidia. Tellah leaves the party to exact revenge on Golbez for Anna's death. After finding a cure for Rosa, the party decides to go to Fabul to protect the Wind Crystal. Here they meet Master Yang, a warrior monk serviced to the kingdom {{and the protection of}} the crystal. The Red Wings attack, and Kain reappears as one of Golbez's servants. He attacks and defeats Cecil; when Rosa intervenes, Golbez kidnaps her and Kain takes the crystal. On the way back to Baron, the party is attacked by Leviathan and separated.|$|E
5|$|The Tamil text Sri Venkatachala Mahatyam relates Maya Sita to Vedavati, but {{her next}} birth is Padmavati, not Draupadi. After Ravana tries to molest Vedavati, she curses {{him that she}} would destroy his clan. She seeks the {{protection}} of Agni. Agni consoles her and gives her not only shelter but also {{the opportunity to take}} her vengeance. He disguises Vedavati as Sita, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be kidnapped by Ravana and hides the real Sita in his refuge. At the time of Agni Pariksha, Vedavati enters the fire and Agni accompanies Sita and Vedavati out in public. Rama is perplexed seeing the two Sitas. The real Sita informs Rama that Vedavati was abducted in her place and suffered the incarceration in Lanka. She demands Rama to marry Vedavati, however Rama refuses citing his vow to have only one wife in this birth. He promises that in Kali yuga (the present and final age), when he appear on earth as Venkateshwara, Vedavati will be born as Padmavati, whom he will marry. Unlike Sanskrit texts, Agni plans the whole thing and Sita conspires with him to protect herself, but also safeguards the surrogate Sita's interests.|$|E

25|$|In a {{religious}} context, the word fatwa carries more meaning. This is because when a Muslim {{has a question}} {{that they need to}} be answered from an Islamic point of view, they ask an Islamic scholar this question, and the answer is known as a fatwa. This fatwa is said by followers to carry more weight than just the random opinion of any person. Muslim scholars are expected to give their fatwa based on religious scripture, not just their personal opinions. Therefore, their fatwa is sometimes regarded as {{a religious}} ruling. Here is an example of a fatwa: Muslims are expected to pray five times every day at specific times during the day. A person <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be on a 12-hour flight may not be able to perform their prayers on time. So they might ask a Muslim scholar for a fatwa on what is the appropriate thing to do, or they might look up the answer in a book or on the internet. The scholar might advise them to perform the prayer to the best of their ability on the plane, or to delay their prayer until they land, for example. And they would support their opinion with scripture. The fatwa is not legally binding or final, it is a respected interpretation of the sharia given by a mufti on a particular case. If the individual doesn't like the fatwa given, he/she can seek out another Mufti or Qadi for a second opinion which might have the desired outcome.|$|E

Later, Peter visits Olivia to rekindle their relationship when he notices a drawing of the same man in the X t-shirt he saw in her mind. Olivia cannot name the man, but nonchalantly refers to him as the person <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill her.|$|E

500|$|Classmates {{believed}} [...] "the plays {{were really}} morbid and grotesque." [...] Ian MacFarlane, Cho's former classmate, stated that, [...] "when we read Cho's plays, {{it was like}} something out of a nightmare. The plays had really twisted, macabre violence that used weapons I wouldn't have even thought of." [...] When Stephen Davis, a senior who was also in Cho's class, read Richard McBeef, he turned to his roommate and said, [...] "This is the kind of guy <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> walk into a classroom and start shooting people." [...] Anna Brown, another student in the class, sometimes joked with her friends that Cho was [...] "the kind of guy who might go on a rampage killing." ...|$|E

500|$|Barbree's {{most recent}} book, [...] "Live from Cape Canaveral: Covering the Space Race, from Sputnik to Today", was {{released}} on August 28, 2007, {{to coincide with the}} 50th anniversary of spaceflight, that began with the Sputnik 1 launch on October 4, 1957. The foreword is written by Tom Brokaw. Barbree's book attempts to illustrate how the media has changed in their coverage of the space programs, from the early enthusiasm to the relative disinterest in the program today. Barbree says he wrote the book because as he looked back over his career, when recalling all the people he'd worked with, very few were left. Barbree claims that he told himself, [...] "You're {{the only one who has}} covered the whole program going all the way back to the beginning, and if you don't tell the story, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it?" [...] It received generally poor reviews from space historians.|$|E
500|$|The game {{featured}} three controversial officiating calls. Regarding {{the second}} quarter Tate touchdown, Fox NFL commentator Ronde Barber and Fox rules analyst Mike Pereira believed Tate had not controlled the ball while falling to the turf. On the contrary, NFL Vice President of Officiating Dean Blandino stated that Tate [...] "controlled the pass right at the goal line. This is not a receiver <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the ground. He is taking his third step, he had demonstrated possession, had become a runner." [...] Late in the fourth quarter, Pernell McPhee was penalized for roughing the passer when it appeared {{that he had been}} pushed into Stafford. During the Lions' game-winning drive in overtime, Willie Young was held, but no penalty was called. Due to the NFL's policies on criticizing officials, Cutler did not comment, while John Fox stated, [...] "We’re not allowed to talk about officials." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for AOL TV, Michael Sciannamea thought [...] "The Convict" [...] seemed {{different}} from previous episodes, citing as evidence {{the scene of}} Michael and Martin discussing trustworthy black men; Sciannamea attributed this to its guest writers: [...] "I don't think Gervais and Merchant went over the top...it just seemed {{a little different than}} the others." [...] Also in his review, Sciannamea expressed his gradual enjoyment of Andy, [...] "When I first saw him up in Stamford, I thought he was just the Connecticut version of Dwight. But now I think he adds greatly to the mix and is definitely one <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stir things up in Scranton." [...] Give Me My Remote's Kath Skerry believed [...] "the uncomfortable, unbearably awkward moments that the UK version perfected are definitely present throughout the episode." [...] She also praised Helms for [...] "prov once again how perfectly he fits in on this show as he is absolutely hysterical." ...|$|E

500|$|FC Barcelona had a {{successful}} start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. In 1902, the club won its first trophy, the Copa Macaya, and participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1–2 to Bizcaya in the final. In 1908, Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became club president {{in a desperate attempt}} to save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling not just on the pitch, but also financially and socially, after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, [...] "Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on." [...] Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.|$|E
500|$|As {{they worked}} on the album, Catatonia feared that {{they were about to}} be dropped by their record label, which they summed up in the song [...] "That's All Folks". Further {{references}} to difficulties with Warner Bros were included in [...] "I Am The Mob", but they preferred working with producer TommyD on the production than they had with those on Way Beyond Blue. The first single off the album had intended to be [...] "Mulder and Scully", but the label insisted that [...] "I Am the Mob" [...] was released instead. As with previous works, this was delayed, and Catatonia performed at festivals during the summer of 1997 while they waited for the release. They were booked for the Glastonbury Festival, but upon arriving they were told their spot had been cancelled. Matthews continued to get the band mentioned in the gossip columns of newspapers due to her drunken behaviour. One example followed an incident at a party celebrating the victory of the yes vote in the Welsh devolution referendum, 1997, as when asked how she felt about the result, she responded [...] "What we want to know is <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> shag Siân Lloyd?" [...] Lloyd subsequently launched legal action, but accepted an apology from Matthews.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy's {{campaign}} {{staff was}} disorganized and Kennedy was initially an ineffective campaigner. The Chappaquiddick incident {{emerged as a}} more significant issue than the staff had expected, with several newspaper columnists and editorials criticizing Kennedy's answers on the matter. In the January 1980 Iowa caucuses that initiated the primaries season, Carter demolished Kennedy by a 59–31 percent margin. Kennedy's fundraising immediately declined and his campaign had to downsize, but he remained defiant, saying [...] " [...] we'll see <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> whip whose what." [...] Nevertheless, Kennedy lost three New England contests. Kennedy did form a more coherent message about why he was running, saying at Georgetown University: [...] "I believe we must not permit the dream of social progress to be shattered by those whose premises have failed." [...] However, concerns over Chappaquiddick and issues related to personal character prevented Kennedy from gaining the support of many people who were disillusioned with Carter. During a St. Patrick's Day Parade in Chicago, Kennedy had to wear a bullet-proof vest due to assassination threats, and hecklers yelled [...] "Where's Mary Jo?" [...] at him. In the key March 18 primary in Illinois, Kennedy failed to gain the support of Catholic voters, and Carter crushed him, winning 155 of 169 delegates.|$|E
