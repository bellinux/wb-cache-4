The Code was not cited in any of the findings against the defendants and never made it into either German or American medical law.|$|E

To make the game proceed more quickly, by default the map is covered in fog of war instead of the Black Mask.

Additionally, Selene is also angry over Frost using the Black Queen moniker when she was leading the Dark X-Men.

Once Selene's inner circle appears on Utopia Frost recognizes Blink and stops Wolverine from killing Wither.

25|$|Following the elections, {{the leaders}} of parties with seats in the Knesset gave their {{suggestions}} to President Reuven Rivlin as to which party leader {{should be given the}} task of forming a coalition. Kulanu, the Jewish Home, Yisrael Beiteinu, Shas and United Torah Judaism all joined the Likud in suggesting the incumbent Prime Minister Netanyahu, giving him the support of 67 of the 120 seats. The Zionist Union and Meretz both suggested Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog, giving him a total of 29 seats. Yesh Atid and the Joint List both chose to abstain and not suggest any party leader. These suggestions do not define who will, and <b>will</b> <b>not,</b> <b>end</b> up in a coalition: In Israel's 2013 election, Hatnuah did not suggest Netanyahu and joined his government, while the ultra-Orthodox parties Shas and United Torah Judaism both suggested Netanyahu, but did not join his coalition.|$|E
25|$|Jealous {{servants}} of Ketil who {{look down on}} slaves, destroy Thorfinn's and Einar's wheat crops. When Thorfinn and Einar confront the jealous servants, they both get into a fight with them where Thorfinn is knocked out and has a gruesome vision. In his dreams, many corpses are seen fighting and clawing at Thorfinn, {{as though they are}} trying to drag him down with them into eternal battle. Thors appears to his son and reveals to Thorfinn that he never wanted him to become a Viking warrior. Thorfinn assumes that this is a nightmarish version of Valhalla, where dead Vikings fight a never ending battle. Askeladd then appears to Thorfinn and reveals that it is not Valhalla nor is it a peaceful afterlife: these are all of the people that Thorfinn has slain. Askeladd further reveals that it is not too late to redeem himself so he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> up there just like him. He tells Thorfinn to become a real warrior just like his father. Thorfinn's vision makes him regret the sins he has done and weeps for those he has slain while contemplating the lives of those he has killed. He resigns to give up and allow the mass of corpses to pull him down but Askeladd encourages him to continue his life. Thorfinn vows to never hurt anyone again and climbs out of the pile and wakes up next to Einar, who declares that they won the fight. Thorfinn declares that he will never hurt anyone again and the duo contemplates their troubles for the fight that just occurred. Luckily, Ketil found evidence of the jealous servants’ wrongdoing and told them to never bother Thorfinn and Einar again.|$|E

500|$|As {{the poem}} progresses, Autumn is {{represented}} metaphorically {{as one who}} conspires, who ripens fruit, who harvests, who makes music. [...] The first stanza of the poem represents Autumn as involved with the promotion of natural processes, growth and ultimate maturation, two forces in opposition in nature, but together creating {{the impression that the}} season <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>end.</b> In this stanza the fruits are still ripening and the buds still opening in the warm weather. Stuart Sperry says that Keats emphasises the tactile sense here, suggested by the imagery of growth and gentle motion: swelling, bending and plumping.|$|E
500|$|In Joe Macbeth (1955), {{the first}} film to {{transpose}} Macbeth into a gang and Mafia-like setting, Fleance {{is replaced by a}} character named Lenny. Lenny's father, Banky, is killed, but Lenny escapes, and gathers a group of angry mobsters to overthrow Macbeth, who has, through a series of murders, made himself the kingpin gangster in the area. Lenny is successful in killing Macbeth in the end, but only after Macbeth has murdered most of his family. In another gangster adaptation, Men of Respect (1991), Fleance is replaced by a character named Phil, who similarly helps overthrow Mike (Macbeth) after his father, Bankie (Banquo), is murdered. Phil is inducted into the gang {{at the end of the}} film, when Mal (Malcolm) has taken over, suggesting that the violent gang culture will continue through generations. This sentiment echoes into the final scenes of Penny Woolcock's Macbeth on the Estate. Macduff shoots Macbeth and takes a ring (representing his high status) off Macbeth's finger. Entering a bar, he flips it to Malcolm, saying, [...] "Hail, king." [...] Malcolm puts it on with some show and elbows his way to the front of the bar. One of the characters he elbows is Fleance (a skinhead), who makes a mock gun out of his fingers and [...] "shoots" [...] at the back of the darker-skinned Malcolm's skull. Again this makes it clear that the violence <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>end</b> with the new generation.|$|E

However, the advent of Web 2 and mobile technology has created a more problematic situation where virtual communities have provided previously missing elements needed to change cognition into behaviour - a sense of belonging and a like-minded support group. This paper comments on the impact of new technologies in creating dissonance and speculates on its impact which mayor may not lead to radical changes in behaviour...|$|R

The lyrics cover such dream sequences as Ray Charles being shot down, paying dues in Canada, and [...] "his angel from above" [...] cheating while playing cards in the dark, slapping him in the face, ignoring his cries, and walking out on him. Morrison said he was inspired to write [...] "Brand New Day" [...] after hearing The Band on the radio playing either [...] "The Weight" [...] or [...] "I Shall Be Released": [...] "I {{looked up at the}} sky and the sun started to shine and all of a sudden the song just came through my head.
