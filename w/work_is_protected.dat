5000|$|Section 50a {{of the new}} law prohibits copying {{works for}} {{personal}} use if the <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>protected</b> by an [...] "effective technical measure". Even an effective protection may be circumvented to watch or listen to the work, though.|$|E

50|$|In Algeria a {{collective}} <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>protected</b> for 50 years from publication, 50 {{years from the}} time it was made accessible to the public if unpublished, or 50 years from the time it is realized that it has not been made available to the public within 50 years of creation.|$|E
50|$|In Norway a <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>protected</b> for 70 years {{following}} the year of death of the author. In a collective or joint work, this is counted from {{the death of the}} longest surviving author. For a motion picture, the following are considered authors: main director, scriptwriter, dialogue author, and composer of original musical score.|$|E

50|$|Where a <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>protected</b> by a {{technological}} protection measure, the rights holders {{are obliged to}} adopt proper solutions to allow the exercise of certain exceptions and limitations by lawful users on request, where the exercise would not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work or unduly prejudice the rights holder (Art. 71-quinquies).|$|E
5000|$|Other computer-implemented {{distortions of}} L.H.O.O.Q. or Mona Lisa {{reproduce}} {{the elements of}} the original, thereby creating an infringing reproduction, if the underlying <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>protected</b> by copyright.

50|$|In the Czech Republic a {{collective}} {{work is a}} work that is created with the participation {{of more than one}} authors at the initiative and under the management of a natural person or of a legal entity and made available to the public under that person’s or entity’s name and where the individual contributions involved in the work are not capable of independent use. The <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>protected</b> for 70 years after it was made publicly available.|$|E
50|$|To {{approach}} this issue, the court fully supported {{the claim that}} non-literal elements of software <b>are</b> <b>protected</b> under copyright. Software is considered a literary work {{for the purposes of}} copyright law, and non-literal elements of literary <b>works</b> <b>are</b> <b>protected</b> under copyright. As such, non-literal elements of software <b>are</b> also <b>protected.</b>|$|R

50|$|Use of {{the notice}} informs {{the public that}} a <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>protected</b> by copyright, {{identifies}} the copyright owner, and shows the year of first publication. Furthermore, {{in the event that}} a work is infringed, if the work carries a proper notice, the court will not give any weight to a defendant’s use of an innocent infringement defense—that is, to a claim that the defendant did not realize that the work was protected. An innocent infringement defense can result in a reduction in damages that the copyright owner would otherwise receive.|$|E
5000|$|Most artists use {{naturally}} occurring oxidised and mineral-charged coloured sands, adding powdered charcoal {{to widen the}} palette {{and in some instances}} idiosyncratic materials such as iron filings or discarded stonemasons' dust from ecclesiastical sites. Other artists use industrial tinted quartz sands with a capacity to resist intemperie action and a new generation of strong adhesives. The <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>protected</b> with a coat of spray varnish. No protective glass frame is needed with the sands and the adhesives since the paintings have proved to resist the effect of direct sunlight without any yellowing of the varnish ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{copyright}} : literally, 'the {{right to}} copy.' The {{owner of a}} copyright has five exclusive rights: reproduction (copying), preparing derivative works (adaptation), distributing copies to the public, performing the work publicly, and displaying the work in public. Prior to 1886, no effective international law of copyright existed. The first major international copyright law conventions were the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works created in 1886. In the US, for works created in 1977 and after the <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>protected</b> by copyright when it is [...] "fixed in any tangible medium of expression," [...] without the need to register it with the US Copyright Office. A work must be registered, however, before a copyright owner may bring suit for infringement.|$|E
50|$|A {{theatrical}} production <b>is</b> any <b>work</b> of theatre, {{such as a}} staged play, musical, comedy or drama {{produced from}} a written book or script. These <b>works</b> <b>are</b> <b>protected</b> by common law or statuary copyright unless in the public domain.|$|R
5000|$|The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, an {{international}} copyright treaty, stipulates that derivative <b>works</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> {{although it does}} not use the term, namely that [...] "Translations, adaptations, arrangements of music and other alterations of a literary or artistic <b>work</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>protected</b> as original <b>works</b> without prejudice to the copyright in the original work".|$|R
5000|$|Originally a <b>work</b> <b>was</b> <b>protected</b> for 50 years pma, or {{from the}} date of {{disclosure}} for anonymous or pseudonymous works. Performer's property rights <b>are</b> <b>protected</b> for 50 years from {{the date of the}} performance. Reverse engineering is permissible by persons lawfully in possession of software. The current general term is 70 pma. It appears that the term changed with the 2010 law.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} film {{is generally}} {{thought to have}} lapsed into the public domain due to a failure to renew the film's copyright after 28 years. However the underlying work, the 1935 book 1101 Park Avenue (re-titled My Man Godfrey with the film's release), had its copyright renewed in 1963 and is thus still in copyright. According to Stanford University Library, and under rulings of Stewart v. Abend, in so-called multilayered works, the rights holder of the original work can claim ownership of the film script (though not the pictures) if the original book is still in copyright. [...] "Films are often based on books [...]. that may maintain copyright. If the pre-existing <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>protected,</b> then rightly or wrongly, it has generally been determined that the derived film is also protected." ...|$|E
5000|$|Designer Guild Limited v. Russell Williams (Textiles) Limited, is {{a leading}} House of Lords case on what {{constitutes}} copying in copyright infringement cases. [...] The House of Lords considered whether there was infringement of a fabric design. Although both the copyrighted work and the infringing design were different in detail, the overall impression of the designs was the same. This decision is significant because the House of Lords ruled that copyright infringement is dependent on whether the defendant copied {{a substantial portion of}} the original work, rather than whether the two works look the same. [...] The outcome suggests that in the United Kingdom the overall impression of a copyrighted <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>protected</b> if the copied features involved the labour, skill and originality of the author's work, even if the copyrighted work and infringing work are different in detail.|$|E
5000|$|From 1957 to 1963, Kitchel {{was general}} counsel for the Arizona Republican Party. In 1958, when Goldwater was first reelected to the Senate, Kitchel wrote the state party {{platform}} in which he defined his conservative philosophy in eight short paragraphs, one of which reads: [...] The preservation of freedom demands that governmental restraints be kept at a minimum and that both freedom of association and the right to <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>protected.</b> [...] Years later Kitchel revealed that he and Goldwater spent little time discussing a potential Goldwater Cabinet, considering the odds against the Republican nominee. [...] "But there was a tentative agreement that the secretary of state was to be Richard Nixon, {{the secretary of the treasury}} General Electric Ralph Cordiner, and I was to be the attorney general." [...] Kitchel penned two books, Too Grave a Risk (1963), an examination of the International Court of Justice and the chasm in the justice systems of most member nations compared to the United States, and The Truth About the Panama Canal (1978), a study of the consequences of agreements between the United States and the Republic of Panama over the control of the Panama Canal waterway.|$|E
