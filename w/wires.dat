5|$|CAB {{inspectors}} had inspected {{units at}} a Teterboro, New Jersey, Bendix Corporation plant and discovered workers using tweezers to bind up bundles of <b>wires,</b> thereby damaging them. The Bendix Corporation issued denials, {{stating that the}} units underwent 61 inspections during manufacturing, in addition to inspections during installation and maintenance work, and insisted that had the insulation on the <b>wires</b> been breached at some point, it would have surely been detected and the unit replaced.|$|E
5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by <b>wires</b> helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few <b>wires</b> {{had to be removed}} digitally in post-production; sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured <b>wires,</b> and entire sets were constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors {{up and down on the}} rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on gimbals so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera at the bottom of a corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera looked up towards the ceiling. In this position, the <b>wires</b> were hidden by the actors as they ascended the corridor.|$|E
5|$|The {{computer}} console {{explosion that}} causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using brillo pads. Weldon hid steel wool inside the console and attached an arc welder to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire. The welder was designed to create a spark instead of actually welding, causing the steel wool to burn and make sparks; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually startled by the flare-ups, resulting in additional takes. Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti-gravity throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants. The crew built a circular track that had the same shape as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on four small <b>wires</b> that connected to the track. The <b>wires</b> were treated with a special acid which oxidized the metal; the reaction tarnished the <b>wires</b> to a dull gray that would not {{show up in the}} deep blue corridor lighting. Cargo boxes were made out of light balsa wood so that fine <b>wires</b> could be used as support.|$|E
50|$|Solid <b>wire,</b> {{also called}} solid-core or single-strand <b>wire,</b> {{consists}} of {{one piece of}} metal <b>wire.</b> Solid <b>wire</b> is useful for <b>wiring</b> breadboards. Solid <b>wire</b> is cheaper to manufacture than stranded <b>wire</b> and is used where there is little need for flexibility in the <b>wire.</b> Solid <b>wire</b> also provides mechanical ruggedness; and, because it has relatively less surface area which is exposed to attack by corrosives, protection against the environment.|$|R
50|$|A barbed <b>wire</b> {{steel cage}} match {{is one of}} any number of matches that uses strands of barbed <b>wire</b> in some capacity. Simply using barbed <b>wire</b> in an {{otherwise}} regular steel cage match {{does not make the}} match a barbed <b>wire</b> steel cage match; the barbed <b>wire</b> must be part of the match's design. Another variations are the Razor <b>Wire</b> Steel Cage Match, a similar concept to that of the barbed <b>wire</b> cage match, however the barbed <b>wire</b> is replaced by razor <b>wire</b> and is wrapped around the top, corners, and walls of the cage, and Barbed <b>wire</b> Razor <b>wire</b> Steel Cage match {{is the same as the}} barbed <b>wire</b> cage match, however the top, corners, and walls of the cage are covered with barbed <b>wire,</b> further covered with razor <b>wire.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Half-hard <b>wire</b> is {{slightly}} stiffer than dead soft <b>wire.</b> Half-hard <b>wire</b> is excellent for making tight, angular bends, for making loops in <b>wire,</b> and for wrapping <b>wire</b> around itself. However, {{it is not}} very useful for making spirals. Finished pieces made with half-hard <b>wire</b> are usually more permanent than pieces made with soft <b>wire.</b>|$|R
5|$|Ørsted did {{not fully}} {{understand}} his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by Ampère, who discovered that two parallel current-carrying <b>wires</b> exerted a force upon each other: two <b>wires</b> conducting currents {{in the same direction}} are attracted to each other, while <b>wires</b> containing currents in opposite directions are forced apart. The interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition of the ampere.|$|E
5|$|According to Mummer Kaylan, {{author of}} The Kemalists: Islamic Revival and the Fate of Secular Turkey, Bazna {{said that he}} began spying for the Germans because he needed the money and, {{although}} {{he was not a}} Nazi, he liked Germans and disliked the British. He also alluded to involvement with the Milli Emniyet Hizmeti, which became the Turkish National Security Service in 1965. The British historian Richard <b>Wires</b> wrote Bazna was motivated entirely by greed as he had dreams of becoming rich by selling secrets to the Germans. <b>Wires</b> described Bazna as a typical petty criminal from the Balkans, a man of low intelligence with no values except greed who was apolitical and opportunistic, taking advantages of whatever chances he found to try to get rich, but who was easily duped by the Germans.|$|E

50|$|EL <b>wire</b> sequencers can flash {{electroluminescent}} <b>wire,</b> or EL <b>wire,</b> in sequential patterns. EL <b>wire</b> {{requires a}} low-power, high-frequency driver {{to cause the}} <b>wire</b> to illuminate. Most EL <b>wire</b> drivers simply light up one strand of EL <b>wire</b> in a constant-on mode, and some drivers may additionally have a blink or strobe mode. A sound-activated driver will light EL <b>wire</b> in synchronization to music, speech, or other ambient sound, but an EL <b>wire</b> sequencer will allow multiple lengths of EL <b>wire</b> to be flashed in a desired sequence. The lengths of EL <b>wire</b> can all be the same color, or a variety of colors.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{reliability}} and the bond strength of <b>wire</b> bonding electronic packages are appraised using <b>wire</b> bond shear test. In this study, a three-dimensional non linear {{finite element model}} was designed to simulate the stress response of the bonded <b>wire</b> during <b>wire</b> bond shear test {{on a flat surface}} bond pad. Comparisons between three types of <b>wire</b> material:gold (Au), aluminium (Al) and copper (Cu) were done to scrutinize the effects of <b>wire</b> material on the stress response of bonded <b>wire</b> during <b>wire</b> bond shear test.

50|$|<b>Wire</b> {{wrapping}} {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} techniques for making handmade jewelry. This technique is done with some jewelry <b>wire</b> and findings similar to <b>wire</b> (like head-pins) to make components. <b>Wire</b> components are then connected to one another using mechanical techniques with no soldering or heating of the <b>wire.</b> Frequently, in this approach, a <b>wire</b> is bent into a loop or other decorative shape and then the <b>wire</b> is wrapped around itself to finish the <b>wire</b> component making that loop or decorative shape permanent. Because of this technique for wrapping <b>wire</b> around itself, this craft is called <b>wire</b> wrapping.|$|R

5|$|For {{landings}} and take-offs, wire flying riggings were devised and used. On location, {{these were}} suspended from tower cranes, {{whereas in the}} studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings. Some of the wire-flying work was quite audacious considering computer-controlled rigs were not then available—the penultimate shot where Superman flies out of the prison yard for example. Although stuntmen were used, Reeve did {{much of the work}} himself, and was suspended as high as 50feet in the air. Counterweights and pulleys were typically used to achieve flying movement, rather than electronic or motorized devices. The thin <b>wires</b> used to suspend Reeve were typically removed from the film in post-production using rotoscope techniques, although this wasn't necessary in all shots (in certain lighting conditions or when Superman is very distant in the frame, the <b>wires</b> were more or less imperceptible).|$|E
5|$|In 1966, the Oslo Metro opened as {{an upgrade}} of two {{existing}} suburban tramways, the Østensjø- and Lambertseter Lines. By 1970, {{the system was}} supplemented by the Grorud- and Furuset Lines. They only operated to the eastern suburbs. In 1987, the system was expanded to connect to the western network, that remained a suburban tramway with overhead <b>wires,</b> two-car platforms and an inferior signaling system. In 1993, the Sognsvann Line was converted to metro standard, with the Røa Line following two years later. When the order for the MX3000 trains was placed, the Kolsås- and Holmenkoll Lines still used overhead <b>wires,</b> {{and would not be}} able to use the new stock. Both systems were at the time being considered for conversion to light rail systems, that would connect to the Lilleaker- and Ullevål Hageby Line, respectively.|$|E

50|$|Increasing gauge numbers denote {{decreasing}} <b>wire</b> diameters, {{which is}} similar to many other non-metric gauging systems such as SWG.

Manufacturers of <b>wire</b> formerly had proprietary <b>wire</b> gauge systems; the development of standardized <b>wire</b> gauges rationalized selection of <b>wire</b> for a particular purpose.|$|R

Jeppson held a flashlight while Parsons disconnected the primer <b>wires,</b> removed the breech plug, inserted the powder bags, replaced the breech plug, and reconnected the <b>wires.</b> Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red.
