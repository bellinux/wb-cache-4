One algorithmic technique that <b>works</b> <b>here</b> is called bounded search tree algorithm, and its idea is to repeatedly choose some vertex and recursively branch, with two cases at each step: place either the current vertex or all its neighbours into the vertex cover.|$|E
25|$|The second work, {{targeted}} at a specialist audience, {{was not intended}} as a textbook but {{as a means to}} show Romanian grammar as it existed in reality; this was in contrast with Tiktin's 1891 teaching manual. Philippide discussed words selected from the dictionary by Alexandru Cihac, the only one he found respectable; and from writers, Moldavians especially: Ion Creangă foremost, but also Mihai Eminescu, Alexandru Odobescu, Costache Negruzzi, Petre Ispirescu, Costache Conachi and Vasile Alecsandri; and from the Moldavian chronicles, as well as a bit of Anton Pann. The book features many examples of the spoken language, some of them in the Moldavian subdialect. He believed the examples would help illustrate the development of the language's inflection and syntax; this methodology is unique in the annals of Romanian grammar <b>works.</b> <b>Here,</b> he introduced the (debated) notion that the Romanian literary language was not based on a particular subdialect, but resulted from each one's contributions. While the Wallachian form was previously dominant, the increasing output of Moldavian writers meant that, {{by the end of the}} 19th century, the written language had become a compromise between the two.|$|E

500|$|From June to August of 1880, Mahler {{took his}} first {{professional}} conducting job, in a small wooden theatre in the spa town of Bad Hall, south of Linz. The repertory was exclusively operetta; it was, in Carr's words [...] "a dismal little job," [...] which Mahler accepted only after Julius Epstein {{told him he would}} soon work his way up. In 1881, he was engaged for six months (September to April) at the Landestheater in Laibach (now Ljubljana, in Slovenia), where the small but resourceful company was prepared to attempt more ambitious <b>works.</b> <b>Here,</b> Mahler conducted his first full-scale opera, Verdi's Il trovatore, one of 10 operas and a number of operattas that he presented during his time in Laibach. After completing this engagement, Mahler returned to Vienna and worked part-time as chorus-master at the Vienna Carltheater.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, [...] "We Wanna" [...] was {{met with}} {{positive}} to mixed reviews by music critics. Henry Einck, writing for German music website Dance Charts, praised the song's [...] "pleasant" [...] melody, which he described as being [...] "suitable for dancing". Additionally, Einck was positive towards Stan's, Inna's and Yankee's vocal parts, but felt they didn't match together. Direct Lyrics's Kevin Apaza labelled the recording as a [...] "future-European-summer-smash", and saw its drop as [...] "going to cause some fierce-dancing moments at clubs". Bradley Stern from MuuMuse felt [...] "We Wanna" [...] was a [...] "super solid, club-ready summer jam bound to blow up from Argentina to Morocco, full of catchy hooks ('Bout to go!') and infectiously sax-y sax noises borrowed from the home of Mr. Saxobeat." [...] He eventually found Stan and Inna outperformed Rihanna and Shakira, and Lady Gaga and Beyoncé, who previously formed female duos. Mike Wass, writing for Idolator, expressed that the track was [...] "a guilty pleasure of the highest order". German portal Hitfire was generally positive towards [...] "We Wanna", explaining that its [...] "verses are disappointingly quiet until the chorus turns up something. Nevertheless, [...] is after a few plays a catchy tune {{that you want to}} hear again and again." [...] Music website Pop Shock's Dijei Zasin criticized Yankee's vocal collaboration on the single for [...] "unnecessary [...] down the song", suggesting that American rapper Pitbull would be an option to feature on a version of [...] "We Wanna" [...] destined to the United Kingdom and the United States. He further concluded that, [...] "What <b>works</b> <b>here</b> are the verses laced in the singers’ trademark attitude, contrasting with the vibey, chilled chorus." ...|$|E

[...] After this comment, Grossman offers Davis a part in a band he is about to put together, consisting of two guys and a girl, which one journalist notes is [...] "a reference to Peter, Paul, and Mary, the trio that Albert Grossman put together in 1961—ultimately choosing Noel Paul Stookey as the third member of the group, rather than Van Ronk, whom he also considered."
