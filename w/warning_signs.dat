5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands of pounds were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, bunding was installed, <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> were put up and security patrols took place. However, large sections of the fencing were stolen and the <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> were ignored. Ultimately this led to one man being trapped on the site for five hours on 22May 1997. He had been looking for scrap metal and power cables, and had climbed through a small hole into an underground room, from which he had to be rescued by fire crews. The site was then designated a danger zone. The derelict site was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the sub-station, creating a fire and damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E
5|$|The Armero {{catastrophe}} came {{shortly after}} the M-19 guerrilla group's raid and subsequent Palace of Justice siege on November 6, worsening an already chaotic situation. After Sánchez's death, blame for it and for the Armero tragedy fell on the Colombian government for its inaction and general indifference to <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> prior to the volcano's eruption.|$|E
5|$|Lisa finds Homer's {{note and}} alerts the family. They hurry {{to the bridge}} to save him, but they are almost {{run over by a}} {{speeding}} truck. Homer pulls them to safety just in time, and he is suddenly filled with a new reason to live: to place a stop sign at the dangerous intersection. After successfully petitioning the city council, Homer embarks on a public safety crusade that involves placing speed bumps and <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> throughout the town.|$|E
30|$|The {{presence}} of the <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> influenced vehicle speed (−[*] 1.5  km/h), {{and so did the}} measure point (−[*] 0.9  km/h) and the wildlife fence (−[*] 29.7  km/h) (Table 2). Also, there was an interaction effect between the <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> and the wildlife fence (2.5  km/h). The slight speed reduction due to the <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> is discernible in Fig. 4, where the red line is slightly below the blue line after the sign, but the effect is not very clear. The <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> and its location, along with large interindividual variations, dominates the resulting MARS model. However, the large speed reduction due to the wildlife fence is probably a spurious result.|$|R
50|$|The sign is {{commonly}} referred to as a radioactivity <b>warning</b> <b>sign,</b> but it is actually a <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> of ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation is a much broader category than radioactivity alone, as many non-radioactive sources also emit potentially dangerous levels of ionizing radiation. This includes x-ray apparatus, medical beam cannons and particle accelerators. Non-ionizing radiation can also reach potentially dangerous levels, but this <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> is different from the trefoil ionizing radiation warning symbol.|$|R

5|$|Off-grid system {{users can}} either adapt to {{intermittent}} power or use batteries, photovoltaic or diesel systems {{to supplement the}} wind turbine. Equipment such as parking meters, traffic <b>warning</b> <b>signs,</b> street lighting, or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a small wind turbine, possibly combined with a photovoltaic system, that charges a small battery replacing {{the need for a}} connection to the power grid.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with several}} other roads in the Highlands, the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe has been {{installed}} with permanent gates that are closed {{in the event of}} severe weather. These gates are now fitted with fibre-optic illuminated signs. The road has been identified as one of several trunk roads in the Highlands that suffers from problems with deer-vehicle collisions. In 1996, Transport Scotland set up a number of vehicle activated <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> alerting drivers attention to nearby deer. Four of these signs are on the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe.|$|E
5|$|McEntee {{has sought}} to raise {{awareness}} of suicide-related issues since her father's death, and in 2013 joined the launch of a suicide prevention campaign by the Pieta House charity, aimed at educating rural communities about the early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> of suicide. She also took part in a sponsored walk from Dublin to Navan for the See the Light campaign, which seeks {{to raise awareness of}} mental health issues. However, she told the Irish Independent that she does not want the focus to be on her father's death every time she attends a suicide prevention event.|$|E

5|$|Most {{living things}} have predators and {{therefore}} {{are in a}} constant evolutionary arms race to develop antipredator adaptations, while the predator adapts to become more efficient at defeating the prey's adaptations. Some organisms have evolved to make detection less likely, for example by nocturnality and camouflage. Others have developed chemical defences such as the deadly toxins of certain snakes and wasps, or the noxious scent of the skunk. Such prey often send clear and honest warning signals to their attackers with conspicuous aposematic (warning) patterns. The brightness of such <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> is correlated {{with the level of}} toxicity of the organism.|$|E
5|$|On the West German side, {{there were}} no fortifications of any kind, nor even any patrol roads in most areas. <b>Warning</b> <b>signs</b> (Grenzschilder) with {{messages}} such as Achtung! Zonengrenze! ("Danger! Zonal border!") or Halt! Hier Zonengrenze ("Stop! Zonal border here") notified visitors. Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents. Signs in English and German provided notifications of {{the distance to the}} border to prevent accidental crossings. No such restriction applied to Western civilians, who were free {{to go up to the}} border line, and {{there were no}} physical obstacles to stop their crossing it.|$|E
5|$|Soldiers at {{the base}} noticed <b>warning</b> <b>signs,</b> {{including}} groups of men watching the construction from the nearby village, which was set at a higher elevation than the outpost, and other groups of men moving through nearby mountains. At a dinner meeting in the village, a villager told the Americans that they should shoot any men seen in the mountains, and asked them if U.S. UAVs were keeping watch nearby. The day before the attack, the militants began flowing water through an irrigation ditch feeding an unused field, creating background noise that masked {{the sounds of the}} advancing fighters.|$|E
30|$|For the {{automatic}} speed camera event, the dataset consisted of 200 cases (25 drivers[*]×[*] 8 road stretches), {{and for the}} radio warning and the <b>warning</b> <b>sign,</b> the data set consisted of 100 cases. Since both the radio message and the <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> affect driving speed, {{it was not possible}} to include road stretches where both factors were active at the same time. This explains the lower number of cases or these factors; road stretches where the radio warning was active were excluded from the <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> analyses and vice versa.|$|R
30|$|The {{mean speed}} was {{extracted}} every 5  m surrounding each event. An ‘event’ was the occurrence or non-occurrence of an automatic speed camera, radio message, or wildlife <b>warning</b> <b>sign.</b> The {{range of the}} data covered a stretch from 1000  m before the event until 2000  m after the event (1000  m after the event {{in the case of}} the <b>warning</b> <b>sign),</b> see Fig. 2. The shorter segment length for the <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> is due to the presence of the moose decoy, which will greatly influence driving speed [24].|$|R

5|$|Until 2008, signs at exit43A in {{downtown}} Cumberland labeled the exit as {{providing access to}} WV28 Alt. Because of this, many truckers used this exit to get to WV28. This created problems on WV28 Alt. in Ridgeley, West Virginia, as trucks became stuck under a low railroad overpass, blocking traffic through Ridgeley. To reduce this problem, the Maryland State Highway Administration removed references to WV28 Alt. from guide signs for exit43A and placed <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> in Cumberland and on I-68 approaching Cumberland advising truckers to instead use exit43B to MD51, which allows them to connect to WV28 via Virginia Avenue, bypassing the low overpass in Ridgeley.|$|E
5|$|As {{they return}} to the city, Olivia and Charlie discuss plans with Astrid on how to capture Milo, but realize that since he can predict their every move, any plan would be futile, and {{approach}} the hotel directly. Milo leads Olivia on a chase through a construction area including a marked zone where the air is too thin, expecting to crush her under a load of cement bricks. Olivia, unaware of the <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> for the zone, races through it instead of stopping {{to put on a}} respirator, nearly asphyxiating herself, and dodges the bricks in time to capture Milo. At the center, Dr. Levin notes that Milo's condition is too far advanced to reverse, and only a computer is able to keep up with his thoughts. Madeline sadly leaves the toy horse at Milo's side.|$|E
5|$|Every {{road that}} is {{maintained}} by DelDOT, including Interstate, U.S., and state routes, is assigned a maintenance road number (also {{known as a}} reference number). The maintenance road numbers are only unique in a specific county and some roads can be designated with multiple road numbers. For example, Bryants Corner Road in Kent County is designated as Road 205, Road 103, and Road 219. Suffixed maintenance road numbers exist near their parent roads, often for a short alignment. For example, Woodland Ferry Road in Sussex County is designated Road 78, while Old Sailor Road, a short road branching off from it near Laurel, is designated as Road 78A. The maintenance road numbers are signed with little white markers at intersections showing the two roads that intersect each other and on auxiliary plates below <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> approaching intersections.|$|E

5|$|The Minister can declare any fence or barrier {{surrounding}} {{a part of}} a security area to be a perimeter fence. The Commissioner of Police is permitted to take steps to prevent people from crossing the fence or passing articles over, through or under the fence, including defensive measures that involve or may involve danger to life. If the measures are taken in a place other than on, under or within the perimeter fence, the Commissioner must take precautions – including displaying prominent <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> – to ensure that people do not accidentally enter the area. If anyone is injured or dies {{as a result of a}} defensive measure, no compensation is payable unless the Minister certifies that it is just and equitable for such compensation to be paid. It is an offence to cross or attempt to cross, or pass or attempt to pass any article over, though or under a perimeter fence except at an authorized entry point; and to damage, attempt to damage or tamper with any fence or any gate or movable barrier at an entry point.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue is typically made clinically, {{on the basis}} of reported symptoms and physical examination; this applies especially in endemic areas. However, early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other viral infections. A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: nausea and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, low white blood cell count, positive tourniquet test, or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an endemic area. <b>Warning</b> <b>signs</b> typically occur before the onset of severe dengue. The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available, involves the application of a blood pressure cuff at between the diastolic and systolic pressure for five minutes, followed by the counting of any petechial hemorrhages; a higher number makes a {{diagnosis of}} dengue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1inch2 (6.25cm2).|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} change detectable on laboratory investigations {{is a low}} {{white blood}} cell count, which may then be followed by low platelets and metabolic acidosis. A moderately elevated level of aminotransferase (AST and ALT) from the liver is commonly associated with low platelets and white blood cells. In severe disease, plasma leakage results in hemoconcentration (as indicated by a rising hematocrit) and hypoalbuminemia. Pleural effusions or ascites can be detected by physical examination when large, but the demonstration of fluid on ultrasound may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome. The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings. Dengue shock syndrome is present if pulse pressure drops to ≤20mmHg along with peripheral vascular collapse. Peripheral vascular collapse is determined in children via delayed capillary refill, rapid heart rate, or cold extremities. While <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> are an important aspect for early detection of potential serious disease, the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak.|$|E

5|$|UNESCO {{identified}} three {{specific areas of}} concern under {{the present state of}} conservation: (i) vandalism by visitors; (ii) soil erosion in the south-eastern part of the site; and (iii) analysis and restoration of missing elements. The soft soil, the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure. Earthquakes are by far the most important contributing factors, since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble, but the earth itself can move in waves, further destroying the structure. The increasing popularity of the stupa brings in many visitors, most of whom are from Indonesia. Despite <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> on all levels not to touch anything, the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards, vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem, leading to further deterioration. As of 2009, there is no system in place {{to limit the number of}} visitors allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only.|$|E
25|$|Moose <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> {{are used}} on roads in regions {{where there is}} a danger of {{collision}} with the animal. The triangular <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> common in Sweden, Norway, and Finland have become coveted souvenirs among tourists traveling in these countries, causing road authorities so much expense that the moose signs have been replaced with imageless generic <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> in some regions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Warning</b> <b>signs</b> {{are very}} similar to <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> in United States. They are yellow {{diamond-shaped}} with a black symbol (the yellow colour is changed to an orange colour in areas under construction). In certain cases, the yellow colour is shifted to fluorescent yellow (in the School area sign and Chevron sign).|$|E
