40|$|The {{interest}} in superhydrophobic coatings have increased exponentially in the recentdecades {{due to their}} potential and versatility in their applications. The use forsuperhydrophobic surfaces range from <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> <b>fabric,</b> to self cleaning surfacesand numerous applications in industry. In this project the durability of 6 differentsuperhydrophobic coatings have been examined. The durability was tested bydropping sand on the surfaces from a set hight of 10 cm and a flow of 40 g/min. Thesurfaces were mounted on a 45 ° angle. The surfaces were abraded for 30 seconds ata time and the static, receding, and advancing contact angles along with the roll-ofangle was measured. Five of the surfaces were built up with nano particles and onewas sand blasted and anodized to create a superhydrophobic structure. The surfacesthat withstood the most abrasion was the surface that had been calcined to improveadhesion and the surface that had been sand blasted and anodized. Measurementsshowed that the roll-off angle and the receding contact angle were the two bestindicators of the deterioration of a surface, while the static contact angle and theadvancing contact angle varied little with abrasion. The project was done at thecompany Technical Research Institute of Sweden (SP) at their chemistry, surfaces andmaterials department in Stockholm. All coatings and equipment was supplied by SP...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to establish the optimum processing conditions and parameters for producing nonwoven fabrics best suited for application in disposable and protective wear for surgical gowns, drapes and laboratory coats. Carded and crosslapped webs, of three basic weights (80, 120, and 150 g/m 2), from greige (unscoured and unbleached) cotton, viscose and polyester fibres, were hydroentangled, using three different waterjet pressures (60, 100 and 120 bars), on a Fleissner Aquajet hydroentanglement machine. An antibacterial agent (Ruco-Coat FC 9005) and a fluorochemical water repellent agent (Ruco Bac-AGP), were applied in one bath using the pad-dry-cure technique, to impart both antibacterial and water repellent properties to the fabrics, SEM photomicrographs indicating that the finished polymers were evenly dispersed on the fabric surface. The effect of waterjet pressure, fabric weight and type and treatment on the structure of the nonwoven produced, was evaluated by measuring the relevant characteristics of the fabrics. As expected, there was an interrelationship between fabric weight, thickness, and density, the fabric thickness and mass density increasing with fabric weight. An increase in waterjet pressure decreased the fabric thickness and increased the fabric density. The water repellent and antibacterial treatment increased the fabric weight and thickness. The antimicrobial activity of the fabrics was assessed by determining the percentage reduction in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria population. The maximum percent reduction at 24 hrs contact time for both bacteria ranged from 99. 5 to 99. 6 percent for all the fabric types. The standard spray test ratings for the three treated fabrics ranged from 80 - 90 percent, whereas that of the untreated <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> <b>fabric</b> was zero, while the contact angles for all the fabric types exceeded 90 degrees, indicating good resistance to wetting. It was found that the tensile strength of the fabric in the cross-machine direction was higher than that in the machine direction, for both the treated and untreated fabrics, with the tensile strengths in both the MD and CD of the treated fabrics were greater than that of the untreated fabrics, the reverse being true for the extension at break. An increase in waterjet pressure increased the tensile strength but decreased the extension at break, for both the treated and untreated fabrics. The finishing treatment decreased the mean pore size of all the fabrics, the mean pore size decreasing with an increase in fabric weight and waterjet pressure. An increase in waterjet pressure and fabric weight decreased the air and water vapour permeability, as did the finishing treatment, although the differences were not always statistically significant. The polyester fabrics had the highest water and air permeability. Hence low weight fabrics of 80 g/m 2, which were hydroentangled at low water jet pressures of 60 bars, were suitable for use in this study due to their higher air and water vapour permeability as well as higher pore size distribution. These group of fabrics thus meet the requirements for surgical gowns, drapes, nurses’ uniforms and laboratory coats...|$|E

40|$|Superhydrophobic {{surfaces}} {{that can}} repel hot liquids {{stand for a}} new generation of self-cleaning surfaces with broad applications. However, can current existing superhydrophobic surfaces repel hot water? In this paper, the repellent characteristics of current existing superhydrophobic surfaces to hot water (50 - 80 °C) were investigated. Representative superhydrophobic surfaces from lotus leaves, Teflon, silica-fluoropolymer composites and sol-gel processes were fabricated on silicon wafers and their repellency to hot water was evaluated based on water-contact angle (WCA) measurements and water uptake. These so-called superhydrophobic surfaces, which usually exhibit high repellency to cool water (around 25 °C), however, show remarkably decreased repellency to hot water. This may be attributed to a decrease of surface tension when the temperature of water increases and the lower surface tension of hot water makes it a better "wetting agent" to get into the pores and fissures of rough surfaces rather than bridging them with surface tension. According to the theories of surface wettability, the wetting state of water droplets on superhydrophobic surfaces can be described as Cassie-Baxter and Wenzel states, respectively. Superhydrophobic surfaces lose their high repellency to hot water due to the transition of the wetting state from Cassie-Baxter state to Wenzel state. Surface roughness, which is usually used for improving surface hydrophobicity, however, is found to improve the wettability of a solid surface to hot water. The results in this paper also show that the wettability of a solid surface is governed by both the surface roughness and surface free energy, but the surface energy is more prevailing than the surface roughness in making the surface repel hot liquids. To fabricate hot <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> <b>fabrics,</b> a nanocomposite of CNTs and Teflon was prepared and applied to commercial fabrics to produce scalding protection clothes. The repellency of the CNTs-Teflon treated fabrics to hot beverages (water, milk, coffee and tea, 50 - 80 °C) was studied.

40|$|Debris {{flows in}} slopes {{initially}} dry, such as post-wildfire debris flows, are initiated by surface runoff and sediment bulking due to reduced infiltration. Soil water repellency, extreme dry soils, and loose, cohesionless materials influence their initiation. The exact link between these features, the resulting infiltration processes and the initiation mechanism of a debris flow remains unclear. Here, {{we examine the}} relation between soil particle wettability and slope processes in physical models. Flume experiments were conducted in 10 % increments of mass ratios of wettable to <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> sand, subjected to artificial rainfall with monitoring of soil water content, pore water pressure, sediment and water discharge and failure mode. To date, wettability was considered only for the <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> end, because it reduces infiltration, enhancing surface runoff. This study demonstrates that slight wettability changes, in the full wettable to <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> range, impact a variety of slope processes. The two extremes, fully wettable and <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> gave opposite responses, retrogressive slides for infiltration-initiated in wettable sand and erosion by surface runoff in <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> sand. The transition was dominated by surface runoff and preferential flow, yielding a combination of erosion and slides. From the tests, a continuous capping effect generated by water repellency was {{a necessary condition for}} erosion and sand bulking i. e., the generation of runoff-initiated debris flows. The sensitivity of the model slope response to artificial rainfall was particularly acute at high ratios of wettable to <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> sand.

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>repellent</b> agents, today mainly {{consisting}} of alkylalkoxysilanes, {{are often used}} on concrete to prolong the service life of the structure. This is accomplished by protecting the reinforcement bars from chlorides or by changing the moisture content inside. When the concrete is treated with a <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> agent {{the properties of the}} surface layer turn from hydrophilic to hydrophobic and thereby water droplets are stopped from entering, still allowing water vapour to pass through. This property change can reduce chloride ingression and stop heavy rain from penetrating through the surface layer. This thesis presents results concerning how the moisture transport and fixation in the surface layer of the concrete is affected by a <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> treatment. It also presents an investigation in which the effective penetration depth and the factors that influence it are studied. The methods used covers uni-dimensional transport of moisture using the so called cup method, measurements on moisture fixation using climate boxes with saturated salt solutions, penetration depth by cracking samples and spraying water on them, and field tests in a harsh tunnel environment. The moisture diffusion coefficient for a <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> treated concrete is close to constant and not nearly as dependent on the relative humidity (RH) as for untreated concrete. Unlike untreated concrete, where capillary suction plays an important role for the moisture transport at high RH, the vapour transport is the dominant transport mechanism even at high RH for <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> treated concrete. The moisture fixation is affected by a <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> treatment and the effect is clearest at high moisture levels. There is, however, a certain amount of moisture present in a concrete treated with a <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> agent. It can also be seen that the main {{reason for this is that}} the capillary porosity is affected by the treatment to a relatively high degree while the gel porosity to a large extent remains unaffected. The three most important factors for the penetration of any <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> agent into concrete is time, porosity and degree of saturation. An empirical equation is derived that gives an idea on how much these factors affect the efficient penetration depth of the <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> agent. Measures prolonging the service life of a concrete structure will lead to savings of natural resources and thus both economical and environmental savings for the community.

Se analiza la variación cromática, color y luminosidad, que sufre el soporte cerámico protegido por la incorporación de un tratamiento con productos hidrofugantes. &# 13; Se propone una metodología nueva, basada en el modelo RGB donde se obtienen valores cuantificables de cada muestra cerámica mediante medición digital del color (histogramas de imagen), tomándose como base el mismo tipo de cerámica sin hidrofugar. &# 13; La variación cromática está determinada por el tipo de hidrofugante y por el material de base, obteniéndose los siguientes resultados:&# 13; - Todos los hidrofugantes estudiados producen variación en la tonalidad y luminosidad de la pieza. &# 13; - El ladrillo rojo ingles (R) es el que presenta menor variación de luminosidad y tonalidad al ser tratado con hidrofugantes. &# 13; - El hidrofugante de componente siliconatos es el que menor variación cromática produce en dos de los tres ladrillos estudiados, tostado (T) y rojo inglés (R) ...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} effect of siloxane-based <b>water</b> <b>repellents</b> on the {{durability}} of monumental stones. Laspra, a micritic limestone typical for the Spanish region of Asturias, and Repedea, an oolitic limestone from Moldavia, Romania were selected for the present study, due to their regional / national significance and level of usage. As for the siloxane-based <b>water</b> <b>repellents,</b> three worldwide used products, namely Lotexan-N, Silres® BS 290 and Tegosivin HL 100 and a newly synthesized nanocomposite material, TMSPMA, obtained starting from the 3 (trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate as a precursor were investigated. The limestones and the <b>water</b> <b>repellents</b> were thoroughly characterized using specific techniques. The coating of the two monumental stones with the mentioned products and the investigation of coating efficiency yielded {{to the conclusion that}} all treatments induce good <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> properties. The treated limestones were afterwards submitted to different artificially accelerated ageing tests – resistance against UV irradiation, resistance to salt mist action and resistance to SO 2 action in the presence of humidity –, the results being analyzed according to standardized evaluation methods. The durability of the treated stones was proved to depend on both stone characteristics and <b>water</b> <b>repellent</b> chemical structure. All four <b>water</b> <b>repellents</b> induced a good protection against UV irradiation, no significant differences among them being noticed. As far as the resistance to salt mist action is concerned, the product that afforded the best results when applied on Laspra was TMSPMA, and on Repedea, Silres® BS 290 or / and TMSPMA showed the highest efficiency. The best resistance to SO 2 action in the presence of humidity was conferred by Tegosivin HL 100 and TMSPMA when applied on Laspra, while Silres® BS 290 and TMSPMA afforded better results in the case of Repedea...|$|R
