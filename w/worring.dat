40|$|Candida albicans, a {{commensal}} organism and a pathogen of humans, {{can switch}} stochastically between a white phase and an opaque phase without an intermediate phase. The white and opaque phases have distinct cell shapes and gene expression programs. Once switched, each phase is stable for many cell divisions. White–opaque switching {{is under a}} 1 –α 2 repression and therefore only happens in a or α cells. Mechanisms that control the switching are unknown. Here, we identify <b>Wor</b> 1 (white–opaque regulator 1) as a master regulator of white–opaque switching. The deletion of <b>WOR</b> 1 blocks opaque cell formation. The ectopic expression of <b>WOR</b> 1 converts all cells to stable opaque cells in a or α cells. In addition, the ectopic expression of <b>WOR</b> 1 in a/α cells is sufficient to induce opaque cell formation. Importantly, <b>WOR</b> 1 expression displays an all-or-none pattern. It is undetectable in white cells, and it is highly expressed in opaque cells. The ectopic expression of <b>Wor</b> 1 induces the transcription of <b>WOR</b> 1 from the <b>WOR</b> 1 locus, which correlates with the switch to opaque phase.

50|$|<b>WOR's</b> {{original}} transmitter {{location was}} in Carteret, NJ using two steel lattice towers and a steel cable {{as a third}} radiating element. The cable hung from a catenary connected {{to the top of}} each of the towers. This created a lopsided figure-8 pattern intended to cover both the NY and Philadelphia markets, making <b>WOR</b> the first 50,000 Watt directional station in the US. Over the years, construction affected <b>WOR's</b> signal strength and <b>WOR</b> sought a new location. Circa 1966, the FCC issued a construction permit for <b>WOR's</b> new and current location in Lyndhurst, NJ. The current location features three full half-wave (692 feet) guyed antennas in a triangular array. <b>WOR</b> is within one mile of both WLIB and WINS. Thus each <b>WOR</b> tower hosts AM detuning apparatus to prevent adverse distortion of WINS and WLIB radiation patterns. Built on hydraulic landfill, the site provides excellent ground conductivity for daytime groundwave radiation. At night, <b>WOR</b> can be heard over most of Europe and Africa. It shares Class A status on 710 kHz with KIRO (AM) in Seattle, KEEL in Shreveport, LA and CKLW Detroit/Windsor and operates 24 hours per day. <b>WOR</b> must protect the radiation pattern of these stations since its transmitter in Lyndhurst, NJ was constructed circa 1968, well after these other 50,000 Watt stations began operations. <b>WOR</b> is the only New York City AM station to have retained its original three-letter call sign, the oldest continually used call letters in the New York City area.|$|R
40|$|The human fungal {{pathogen}} Candida albicans {{can switch}} between two cell types, “white” and “opaque,” {{each of which is}} heritable through many cell divisions. Switching between these two cell types is regulated by six transcriptional regulators that form a highly interconnected circuit with multiple feedback loops. Here, we identify a seventh regulator of white-opaque switching, which we have named <b>Wor</b> 4. We show that ectopic expression of <b>Wor</b> 4 is sufficient to drive switching from the white to the opaque cell type, and that deletion of <b>Wor</b> 4 blocks switching from the white to the opaque cell type. A combination of ectopic expression and deletion experiments indicates that <b>Wor</b> 4 is positioned upstream of <b>Wor</b> 1, and that it is formally an activator of the opaque cell type. The combination of ectopic expression and deletion phenotypes for <b>Wor</b> 4 is unique; none of the other six white-opaque regulators show this pattern. We determined the pattern of <b>Wor</b> 4 binding across the genome by ChIP-seq and found it is highly correlated with that of <b>Wor</b> 1 and <b>Wor</b> 2, indicating that <b>Wor</b> 4 is tightly integrated into the existing white-opaque regulatory circuit. We previously proposed that white-to-opaque switching relies on the activation of a complex circuit of feedback loops that remains excited through many cell divisions. The identification of a new, central regulator of white-opaque switching supports this idea by indicating that the white-opaque switching mechanism is considerably more complex than those controlling conventional, nonheritable patterns of gene expression...|$|R

It is therefore not surprising that a number of curvature estimation methods have been proposed in literature; see [18] [4] [8] for recent surveys. <b>Worring</b> [17] recognises three classes of approaches to curvature estimation: orientation based [13] [1] [2], path based [9] [11] [10] [14] and osculating circle based [16].

30|$|Due to {{the needs}} of many {{practical}} applications, extensive research has been conducted on the problem of curvature estimation. In a real-world application, data are often given in discrete values sampled from an object. Hence, one is required to estimate curvature or principal curvatures from discrete values. Flynn and Jain [4] report an empirical study on five curvature estimation methods available at that time. Their study's main conclusion is that the estimated curvatures are extremely sensitive to quantization noise and multiple smoothings are required to get stable estimates. Trucco and Fisher [16] have similar conclusion. <b>Worring</b> and Smeulders [7] identify five essentially different methods for measuring curvature on digital curves. By performing a theoretical analysis, they conclude that none of these methods is robust and applicable for all curve types. Magid et al. [17] provide a comparison of four different approaches for curvature estimation on triangular meshes. Their work manifests the best algorithm suited for estimating Gaussian and mean curvatures.|$|E

40|$|The {{estimation}} of the curvature of experimentally obtained curves {{is an important issue}} in many applications of image analysis including biophysics, biology, particle physics, and high energy physics. However, the accurate calculation of the curvature of digital contours {{has proven to be a}} difficult endeavor, mainly because of the noise and distortions that are always present in sampled signals. Errors ranging from 1 % to 1000 % have been reported with respect to the application of standard techniques in the {{estimation of}} the curvature of circular contours [M. <b>Worring</b> and A. W. M. Smeulders, CVGIP: Im. Understanding, 58, 366 (1993) ]. This article explains how diagrams of multiscale bending energy can be easily obtained from curvegrams and used as a robust general feature for morphometric characterization of neural cells. The bending energy is an interesting global feature for shape characterization that expresses the amount of energy needed to transform the specific shape under analysis into its lowest energy state (i. e., a circle). The curvegram, which can be accurately obtained by using digital signal processing techniques (more specifically through the Fourier transform and its inverse, as described in this work), provides multiscale representation of the curvature of digital contours. The {{estimation of the}} bending energy from the curvegram is introduced and exemplified with respect to a series of neural cells. The masked high curvature effect is reported and its implications to shape analysis are discussed. It is also discussed and illustrated that, by normalizing the multiscale bending energy with respect to a standard circle of unitary perimeter, this feature becomes an effective means for expressing shape complexity in a way that is invariant to rotation, translation, and scaling, and that is robust to noise and other artifacts implied by image acquisition.

Eastbound <b>WORs</b> approximate the JFK–LHR great circle (GC) route following northerly shifted jets in the +NAO period.
