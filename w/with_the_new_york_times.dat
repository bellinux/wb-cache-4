In the oncoming days leading to production, {{areas of the}} town were temporarily remodeled to represent Sitka, Alaska, the setting {{of most of the}} film. Principal photography officially began on April 9 at Bearskin Neck, where it continued over a period of 24 hours. Filming continued at the Motif Number One building on Bradley Wharf (April 14–16), the Haskins Building (April 15–18), and the central business district of Rockport (April 17). Principal photography relocated to Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts on April 22, where it resumed over an approximate period of two weeks. In response, city officials accommodated the producers by renting out all publicly owned parking lots. Filming for The Proposal was shortly delayed after Bullock and her husband were involved in a car accident. The wedding scene was filmed in a three-story twentieth century Victorian home; photography took place at the residence for three weeks. In an interview <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times,</b> the owners of the home stated that Nelson Coates knocked on their door asking for leaves. Initially, the owners directed Coates to other residences in the area; however, they eventually gave the film's producer a tour of the house. Production occurred {{on the first floor of}} the home. Outside of the Cape Ann area, filming took place in Boston, Massachusetts at the State Street Bank Building and in Lower Manhattan in New York City. The Proposal contained 350 special effect shots, and some parts were edited using computer-generated imagery. The score to The Proposal was composed by Aaron Zigman, who recorded his score with the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Sony Scoring Stage.|$|E

25|$|While the CIA {{insists that}} those who {{conducted}} the attacks on 9/11 were not aware that the agency was operating at 7 World Trade Center {{under the guise of}} another (unidentified) federal agency, this center was the headquarters for many notable criminal terrorism investigations. Though the New York field offices' main responsibilities were to monitor and recruit foreign officials stationed at the United Nations, the field office also handled the investigations of the August 1998 bombings of United States Embassies in East Africa and the October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole. Despite the fact that the CIA's New York branch may have been damaged by the 9/11 attacks and they had to loan office space from the US Mission to the United Nations and other federal agencies, there was an upside for the CIA. In the months immediately following 9/11, there was a huge increase in the amount of applications for CIA positions. According to CIA representatives that spoke <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times,</b> pre-9/11 the agency received approximately 500 to 600 applications a week, in the months following 9/11 the agency received that number daily.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{government}} crackdown, Polanco-Rodriguez escaped arrest in New York by fleeing to the Dominican Republic with a fake passport. However, {{he was unable}} to stay out of trouble. He was shot in the leg during a gunfight over a woman in a Santiago nightclub. United States officials insisted that the Dominican government either extradite or imprison him. He was arrested in 1988 and sent to La Victoria prison without a trial. After fighting with other prisoners, Polanco-Rodriguez was transferred to the Monte Plata jail in 1990, where he bribed guards to allow him certain luxuries. But once again Polanco-Rodriguez became involved in an intense struggle with inmates when he stopped the attempted rape of a female prisoner. Fellow prisoners attempted to burn him alive by setting his cell cot on fire. Finally, in 1992, prison authorities released him. He is married to a woman named Johani Candelario, daughter of Renato Candelario, and is the father of five children. In an interview <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> in 1996, Polanco-Rodriguez said he had retired from his life of crime, and DEA and Dominican drug officials said they have no evidence to the contrary.|$|E
