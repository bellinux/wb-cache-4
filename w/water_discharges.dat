40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the changes in}} the time series of <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> and sediment load of the Yellow River into the Bohai Sea. To determine the characteristics of abrupt changes and multi-scale periods of <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> and sediment load, data from Lijin station were analyzed, and the resonance periods were then calculated. The Mann-Kendall test, order clustering, power-spectrum, and wavelet analysis were used to observe <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> and sediment load into the sea over the last 62 years. The most significant abrupt change in <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> into the sea occurred in 1985, and an abrupt change in sediment load happened in the same year. Significant decreases of 64. 6 % and 73. 8 % were observed in <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> and sediment load, respectively, before 1985. More significant abrupt changes in <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> and sediment load were observed in 1968 and 1996. The characteristics of <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> and sediment load into the Bohai Sea show periodic oscillation at inter-annual and decadal scales. The main periods of <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> are 9. 14 years and 3. 05 years, whereas the main periods of sediment load are 10. 67 years, 4. 27 years, and 2. 78 years.

Results are also presented on the Jamuna River accretion and <b>water</b> <b>discharge.</b> Landsat images from 1977 to 2014 and <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> data were analysed to find out a relationship between dynamics of erosion and accretion for different time intervals with average annual <b>water</b> <b>discharge.</b> It is clearly established that total amount of erosion and accretion rates varies with different times. The highest erosion rate 21. 15 km 2 year - 1 was observed in the period of 1989 - 1992 and the highest accretion rate 13. 57 km 2 year - 1 was observed in the period of 1980 - 1989. The erosion and accretion values fluctuated with increasing average annual maximum <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> but the difference between erosion and accretion had remained low before <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> reached to 67000 m 3 s - 1 and it is estimated higher after crossing annual average maximum <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> of 67000 m 3 s - 1.

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>discharge</b> and {{sediment}} load have changed continuously {{during the last}} half century in the Yellow River basin, China. In the present paper, data from 7 river gauging stations and 175 meteorological stations are analyzed in order to estimate quantitatively the contributions of human activities and climate change to hydrological response. Coefficients of <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> (C(w)) {{and sediment}} load (C(s)) are calculated for the baseline period of 1950 s- 1960 s according to the correlations between the respective hydrological series and regional precipitation. Consequently, the natural <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> and natural sediment load time series are reconstructed from 1960 s- 2008. Inter-annual impacts are then separated from the impacts of human activities and climate change on the hydrological response of different regions of the Yellow River basin. It is found that human activities have the greatest influence on changes to the hydrological series of <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> and sediment load, no matter whether the effect is negative or positive. Moreover, the impact of human activities is considerably greater on <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> than sediment load. During 1970 - 2008. climate change and human activities respectively contribute 17 % and 83 % to the reduction in <b>water</b> <b>discharge,</b> and 14 % and 86 % to the reduction in sediment yield in the Upper reaches of Yellow River basin; The corresponding relative contributions in the Middle reaches are 71 % and 29 % to reductions in <b>water</b> <b>discharge.</b> and 48 % and 52 % to reductions in sediment load. Moreover, it is observed that the impacts of human activities on the whole basin are enhanced with time. In the 2000 s. the impact of human activities exceeds that of climate change in the 2000 s, with human activities directly responsible for 55 % and 54 % of the reductions in <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> and sediment load in the whole basin.
