40|$|The {{electronic}} {{surface structure}} of Mo incorporated WO 3 WO 3 Mo is investigated using direct and inverse photoemission and {{compared to that}} of pure Mo free WO 3. The films are found to be n type with an electronic surface band gap of 3. 27 0. 15 eV. The conduction band minimum valence band maximum is 0. 64 0. 10 eV above [2. 63 0. 10 eV below] the Fermi level andat most 0. 38 0. 11 eV above the H H 2 reduction potential [at least 1. 66 0. 11 eV below the H 2 O O 2 oxidation potential]. The findings suggest an explanation <b>why</b> <b>WO</b> 3 Mo WO 3 bilayer structures show improved photoelectrochemical performance compared to respective single layer photoanode...|$|E

"Well, sir," [...] {{said the}} latter in some surprise, [...] "in course I don't know <b>why</b> you <b>wos</b> a-goin' to leave a feller-creetur to his fate, but I'm glad you didn't go for to do it, 'cos it wouldn't have bin Christian-like. But I'm bound for to thank 'ee, sir, all the same for havin' saved me-- and Cuffy." ...|$|R

When me did see the rincumcoshindy goin' on ashore, me say, `Now, Bunco, {{you time}} come; look alive;' so, w'en de raskil called de fuss mate orders out de boat in great hurry, me slip into it like one fish. Then dey all land an' go off like mad into de woods arter you--as you do knows. Ob coorse me stop to look arter de boat; you knows {{it would be}} very bad to go an' leave de boat all by its lone, so w'en deys gone into de woods, me take the mate's gun and poodair an' shot an' ebbery ting could carry off--all de grub, too, but der worn't too moche of dat--and walk away in anoder d'rection. Me is used to de woods, you sees, so kep' clear o' de stoopid seamans, who soon tires der legses, as me knows bery well; den come round in dis d'rection; find you tracks; foller im up; shoots tree birds; sees a tiger; puts a ball in him skin, an' sends him to bed wid a sore head-- too dark for kill him--arter which me find you out, an' here me is. Dere. Dat's all about it." ...|$|R

[...] "Ye see, lads, I've had more or {{less to do with}} the sea, I have, since ever I comed into this remarkable world--not that I ever, to my knowledge, knew one less coorous, for I never was up in the stars; no more, I s'pose, was ever any o' you. I was born at sea, d'ye see? I don't 'xactly know how I comed for to be born there, but I wos told that I wos, and if them as told me spoke truth, I s'pose I wos. I was washed overboard in gales three times before I comed for to know myself at all. When I first came alive, so to speak, to my own certain knowledge, I wos a-sitting {{on the top of a}} hen-coop aboard an East Indiaman, roarin' like a mad bull as had lost his senses; 'cause <b>why?</b> the hens <b>wos</b> puttin' their heads through the bars o' the coops, and pickin' at the calves o' my legs as fierce as if they'd suddenly turned cannibals, and rather liked it. From that time I began a life o' misery. My life before that had bin pretty much the same, it seems, but I didn't know it, so it didn't matter. D'ye know, lads, when ye don't know a thing it's all the same as if it didn't exist, an' so, in coorse, it don't matter." ...|$|R
