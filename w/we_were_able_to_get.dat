25|$|In 2007, Jack Roush, {{owner of}} Roush Racing, offered Kvapil {{a seat in}} the No. 6 Ford F-150 in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. Kvapil {{replaced}} Mark Martin in the truck, who moved to Ginn Racing, and David Ragan, who was promoted to replace Martin in the No. 6 Ford in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Jack Roush, excited about signing with Kvapil, said, “We are pleased beyond measure that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a driver the caliber of Travis Kvapil. At only 30 years old with a Truck championship and two years of Sprint Cup experience under his belt, Travis brings great long and short term potential to and for Roush Racing.” He finished the season with four wins, three poles, eight Top 5's and 12 Top 10's. He finished the season sixth in the driver point standings. He returned to Roush Fenway Racing as a part-time driver in 2008 when Joey Clanton was released from the No. 09 Ford.|$|E

500|$|To {{play the}} part of Pinker, cast {{director}} Rick Millikan read a number of actors. At the last minute, Millikan {{decided to make a}} call to noted actor John Diehl, famous for his work in Nixon, Stargate, and Miami Vice. Millikan explained that, [...] " [...] had been on my list to put into the show since Day One. [...] It turned out the producers like him too—he'd read for us a couple of times already—and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him in without even a reading".|$|E
500|$|Revelations uses a ported and {{downsized}} {{version of}} the internally developed MT Framework graphics engine, which was originally designed for high definition (HD) games such as Devil May Cry 4 and Lost Planet 2. Capcom's previous experience with The Mercenaries 3D helped the development team improve the technical and graphical aspects of the game to a greater extent. According to Nakanishi, [...] "It was thanks to the tremendous efforts of our technical team that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> console-quality graphics from portable hardware." [...] Some techniques were used to reduce performance costs; for example, the Genesis scanner reduces the on-screen display complexity, while some creatures were designed to have simplistic skeletal physics and no HD textures. A pair of glasses for Jill was originally suggested as the Genesis scanner.|$|E
500|$|On 15 March 2008, the band's {{tour bus}} {{burst into flames}} outside their hotel in Medford, Massachusetts. Noonan and Geraghty were on board the vehicle {{alongside}} their manager and a friend. Brian Crosby, Dominic Phillips, and Tim O'Donovan were inside the hotel. Fire fighters were called to the scene shortly after 3:30am and spent ninety minutes fanning the blaze, which started in the bus ventilation/air-conditioning unit and caused an estimated $50,000 (€32,000) worth of damage. Talking to local newspaper the Boston Herald, the band's manager, Foye Johnson said: [...] "The guys were basically around the bus, which {{was a good thing}} because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> all the equipment and instruments out." [...] After a few hours of sleep, off they went in a replacement vehicle to New York City where the band played a sell-out show in the Bowery Ballroom and appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, Other North American television appearances during the early part of 2008 included MTV Canada, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and Late Night with Conan O'Brien. They would return to perform on the Late Show with David Letterman one year later.|$|E

2500|$|Later that night, the {{president}} of Pride FC made a public apology to Mezger at the Tokyo Dome for the miscommunication. Braverman added, [...] "We had a big meeting (with PRIDE). <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some concessions out of them, money and guarantees of future fights. They {{wanted to make it}} right. One thing I said in the meeting was, [...] "Do you want me to call Kenny back in here and see what he says?" [...] "No, no, no, no!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The head of China's {{delegation}} {{said that}} [...] "The meeting {{has had a}} positive result, everyone should be happy." [...] Wen Jiabao, China's prime minister said that the weak agreement was because of distrust between nations: [...] "To meet the climate change challenge, the international community must strengthen confidence, build consensus, make vigorous efforts and enhance co-operation." [...] India's environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, has been reported as saying, [...] "We can be satisfied that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> our way" [...] and that India had [...] "come out quite well in Copenhagen".|$|E
2500|$|Jimmie Johnson {{took the}} lead with nine laps {{remaining}} to take his first win at Michigan International Speedway. This was his first career win at Michigan, after numerous unsuccessful attempts that ended with crashes, engine failures, or running out of fuel. [...] "We had figured out every way to lose this race," [...] Johnson said after winning at Michigan {{for the first time}} in 25 tries. [...] "And today <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it done. [...] "We really were in a win-win situation," [...] he added. [...] "Those guys still had to come to pit road to make it to the end. Once I got an idea of how the race was unfolding, I knew we were in the catbird seat and were able to take advantage of it. When it came down to strategy in the end, which we all knew it would at Michigan, Chad nailed the strategy." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} supramolecular {{catalysts}} {{making use of}} both experimental and theoretical approaches. In this manner <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> understand the behavior of these supramolecular complexes at the molecular level. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> give an explanation for both the increase in activity and the change in selectivity when porphyrin building blocks are used. At the same time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> show why these changes are much less pronounced when using salphen building blocks. Hopefully, understanding how these catalysts work facilitates the design {{and development of the}} next generation of hydroformylation catalysts...|$|R

"The whole {{eastern half}} of my lagoon is shallow, you must understand," [...] said Attwater; [...] "so <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in the dress to great advantage.

6000|$|... "Yes, Monsieur Duchesne {{himself was}} in town, and madame, Myra, and I had just time {{to gain the}} forest. There we were joined by Dinah, who did {{everything}} for us. Madame was attacked by fever, but fortunately Dinah knew of a very safe place of refuge. She did everything for us, fetched up provisions, concocted medicine, and after being ten days in hiding, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{them down to the}} town." ...|$|E
60|$|The weather {{becoming}} moderate, {{all hands}} {{of us went}} into Liverpool, the best way we could.

When we got out the cargo, we found it much damaged, particularly the wheat. The last was so hot that we could not bear our feet among it. We got it all out in a few days, when we went into a dry dock, and repaired.|$|E
60|$|Next, {{we started}} cocked hat--that is to say, a {{triangle}} of three pins, {{the other seven}} being discarded. In this game we used the three smallest balls and kept on delivering them until we got the three pins down. After {{a day or two}} of practice <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the chief pin with an output of four balls, but it cost us a great many deliveries to get the other two; but by and by we succeeded in perfecting our art--at least we perfected it to our limit. We reached a scientific excellence where we could get the three pins down with twelve deliveries of the three small balls, making thirty-six shots to conquer the cocked hat.|$|E
