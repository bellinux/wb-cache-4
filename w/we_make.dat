If we put out a screen machine there will be a use for maybe about ten of them in the whole United States. With that many screen machines you could show the pictures to everybody in the country—and then it would be done. Let's not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.|$|E
5|$|We {{always start}} out with a musical idea. Great effort goes into {{creating}} a solid melodic core. We both play the keyboards and program, but in general Mikkel plays the instruments and controls Pro Tools, while Tor has the executive overlook as well as lyrical input. However, we both are hands on and have no rules or limitations. When we have some killer beats and musical starting points, we hook up with one of our favorite topline writers, who gets cracking on the lyrics and melody. <b>We</b> <b>make</b> sure there's a lot of melody in the track, so it can inspire the writer. Together with the topline writer we work, often tweek and simplify the song, and never quit before we feel we've got a killer hook.|$|E

25|$|In {{regards to}} the mere-exposure effect and {{decision}} making, Zajonc states {{that there has been}} no empirical proof that cognition precedes any form of decision making. While this is a common assumption, Zajonc argues that the opposite is more likely: decisions are made with little to no cognitive process. He equates deciding upon something with liking it, meaning that more often we cognize reasons to rationalize a decision instead of deciding upon it. Therefore, <b>we</b> <b>make</b> judgments first, and then seek to justify those judgments by rationalization.|$|E

They also need to teach/lead the mindsets of the children about how education is important and how child labor should not be their only main focus, but education should be too. More people should do this, while still focusing on their finances.|$|E
