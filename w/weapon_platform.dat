25|$|The {{experience}} gained {{in designing the}} Project 17 Shivalik-class frigates will {{be applied to the}} Project 17A (P17A). The Project 17A frigates will improve upon the Project 17 (P17) in terms of stealth. They will have covered mooring deck and the number of antennae on the ship will be reduced by using a AESA radar. The P17A will also feature better roll stabilisation and a discreet visual profile. The <b>weapon</b> <b>platform</b> in the P17A ships will be compact and they will be armed with the Barak 8 (missile) surface-to-air missile developed jointly by India and Israel, and the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile. The weapon systems will be flush deck mounted allowing vertical launch of missiles from under the deck. The crew complement will be reduced from the existing 257 (including 35 officers) to about 150 by using high levels of automation, which will reduce the operational costs by around 20 per cent and result in higher operational availability of the warships. The construction times will be reduced and productivity will improved by using modular integrated construction. The ship will have a displacement of 6,670 tonnes.|$|E
500|$|As the {{operation}} progressed, newer technologies (low-light television cameras, infrared vision devices, side-looking radars, radar jamming equipment, and computer-directed fire control systems) were also fielded {{to improve the}} performance of these aircraft. The apex of these developments was reached by the deployment of the AC-130E Spectre, a conversion of the venerable C-130 Hercules cargo transport, in February 1968. By 1970 the Spectre had become the most formidable <b>weapon</b> <b>platform</b> fielded by the Air Force in its war against trucks.The PAVN 377 Air Division's history notes [...] "Just one hour when AC-130s did not operate over our chokepoints was both precious and rare." ...|$|E
2500|$|Turrets were weapon mounts {{designed}} to protect the crew and mechanism of the [...] artillery piece and with the capability of being aimed and fired in many directions as a rotating <b>weapon</b> <b>platform.</b> This platform can be mounted on a fortified building or structure such as an anti-naval land battery, or on a combat vehicle, a naval ship, or a military aircraft.|$|E
50|$|A <b>weapons</b> <b>platform</b> is {{generally}} any structure or system {{on which a}} weapon can be mounted. For example, a fighter jet is a <b>weapons</b> <b>platform</b> for missiles, bombs or autocannons. Other vehicles such as the Humvee are considered <b>weapons</b> <b>platforms</b> as well, such as for grenade launchers, machine guns and some missile launchers.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>weapons</b> <b>platforms</b> were chariots, {{followed by}} war-wagons. The ancient Greek Helepolis, a massive siege tower which mounted catapults, {{could also be}} considered a <b>weapons</b> <b>platform.</b> The next attempt to mount <b>weapons</b> on <b>platforms</b> was made at sea, with catapults and eventually cannon mounted on their final form as ships of the line {{before the advent of}} ironclad warships mounting turrets.|$|R
