As frightened as we were of technology, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>our</b> students to have positive experiences with computers. <b>We</b> also <b>wanted</b> the computer to be a useful tool for our students rather than a meaningless rote activity. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>our</b> students to use a variety of literacy materials, participate in many reading and writing responses, and interact in groups as they used the computer as one medium for learning. In this article we describe our learning process, along with the struggles as well as the benefits. As a result of our personal learning journey, an interactive unit was developed that transported students on a journey to Australia...|$|R

500|$|After his {{retirement}} from an mechanical failure, Bräck stated it affected his championship chances slightly and {{his retirement}} {{from the race}} was [...] "something that you don't want to have happen but unfortunately it happens sometimes and today {{it was one of}} those days." [...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points deducted and was placed on probation for the next three road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a probation period of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: We did not want to simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this will not be tolerated. Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>our</b> response to send out the very strong message that this isn't a slap on the wrist, or a token punishment.|$|E

She also recorded a song for the Hope for Haiti Now album. In response to the May 2010 Tennessee floods, Swift donated $500,000 during a telethon hosted by WSMV. In 2011, Swift used a dress rehearsal of her Speak Now tour as a benefit concert for victims of recent tornadoes in the United States, raising more than $750,000. In 2012, Swift supported Architecture for Humanity's Restore the Shore MTV telethon in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. In 2016, she made donations to the Louisiana flood relief and Dolly Parton Fire Fund.|$|E

2500|$|Palestinian {{archaeologists have}} also {{discovered}} {{a number of}} sites of significance to Christianity. At Tell Umm Amer in 2001, a Byzantine-era mosaic was unearthed. Experts believe it forms part of the oldest monastic complex ever to be discovered in the Middle East, likely founded in the 3rd century by Saint Hilario. While the archaeologists working at the site are Muslim Palestinians, they see nothing unusual about their desire to protect and promote a Christian shrine in an area inhabited by only 3,500 Christians today. Said Yasser Matar, co-director of the dig: [...] "This is our history; this is our civilisation and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>our</b> people {{to know about it}} [...] First we were Christians and later we became Muslims. These people were our forefathers: the ancient Palestinians." [...] Dr. Moin Sadeq, director general of the Department of Antiquities in Gaza, has submitted an application to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) to assign it World Heritage Site status and fund the site's protection, restoration and rehabilitation for visitors. Another Byzantine era monastery and mosaic, since named the 'Jabalya Mosaic', was excavated by the Palestinian Department of Antiquities after its discovery by labourers working on Salah ad-Din road in Gaza City.|$|E

2500|$|The Stooge films {{made between}} 1935 and 1941 {{captured}} {{the team at}} their peak, according to film historians Ted Okuda and Edward Watz, authors of The Columbia Comedy Shorts. Nearly every film produced became a classic in its own right. Hoi Polloi (1935) adapted the premise of Pygmalion, with a stuffy professor making a bet that he can transform the uncultured trio into refined gentlemen; the plotline worked so well that it was reused twice, as Half-Wits Holiday (1947) and Pies and Guys (1958). Three Little Beers (1935) featured the Stooges running amok {{on a golf course}} to win prize money. Disorder in the Court (1936) features the team as star witnesses in a murder trial. Violent is the Word for Curly (1938) was a quality Chase-directed short that featured the musical interlude [...] "Swingin' the Alphabet". In A Plumbing We Will Go (1940)—one of the team's quintessential comedies—the Stooges are cast as plumbers who nearly destroy a socialite's mansion, causing water to exit every appliance in the home. Other entries of the era are considered among the team's finest work, including Uncivil Warriors (1935), A Pain in the Pullman (1936), False Alarms (also 1936), Grips, Grunts and Groans (1937), The Sitter Downers (also 1937), Dizzy Doctors (also 1937), Tassels in the Air (1938), <b>We</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Our</b> Mummy (1939), Nutty but Nice (1940), An Ache in Every Stake (1941) and In the Sweet Pie and Pie (also 1941).|$|E
