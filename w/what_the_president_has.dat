It is an exploratory attempt at categorizing, correlating, and explaining trends in Congressional, presidential, and public concern for national security between 1950 and 1977. Chapters II through IV discuss measures of Congressional concern based on defense appropriations; presidential concern based on the national security related remarks in the annual {{state of the union}} presentations and the defense budget requests; and public concern based on public opinion poll data. Chapter V discusses <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>has</b> recommended be done and what forces and capabilities the Department of Defense has developed to counter the perceived threat to U.

The findings and conclusions of the individual chapters are then brought together in Chapter VI as a summarization and explanation of the trends and major changes in concern for U.

Into this storm Count Falkenhayn entered, with his paper in his hand; and at once there was a rush to get near him and hear him read his motion. In a moment he was walled in by listeners.
