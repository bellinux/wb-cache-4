5|$|Krishna's {{childhood}} {{illustrates the}} Hindu concept of lila, playing {{for fun and}} enjoyment and not for sport or gain. His interaction with the gopis at the rasa dance or Rasa-lila is an example. Krishna plays his flute and the gopis come immediately, from <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing, to {{the banks of the}} Yamuna River, and join him in singing and dancing. Even those who could not physically be there join him through meditation. He is the spiritual essence and the love-eternal in existence, the gopis metaphorically represent the prakṛti matter and the impermanent body.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of zduhaći {{was not much}} different from that of ordinary people, but they had some traits that set them apart. They were deep sleepers, very hard to wake up, often drowsy, pensive, thoughtful, and solemn. Their faces were often puffy, eyes shadowy. They were wise and shrewd, successful in <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing and resourceful in dealing with problems; their households were prosperous. In Semberija, zduhaći were said to be good scapulimantic diviners, {{and to be able to}} communicate with domestic animals. The clan of Paštrovići from Montenegrin Littoral claimed that the zduhaći could hear any doings anywhere in the world; if someone stepped on a zduhać's foot, they could hear that too. The clan of Kuči held that the zduhaći were outstanding long jumpers.|$|E
25|$|The Succession to the Crown Act 1543 was {{the third}} such act {{of the reign of}} Henry VIII. It {{endorsed}} the provisions of Henry's last will (<b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>were)</b> in assigning the order of succession, after Elizabeth's death. It in consequence supported in parliamentary terms the succession claims of Lady Catherine Grey, Protestant and born in England, over those of Mary, Queen of Scots. Further, it meant that the Stuart claimants were disadvantaged, compared to the Suffolk claimants, though James VI was descended from the older daughter of Henry VII.|$|E

25|$|Although Sandford {{accepted}} imprisonment as {{the will}} of God, he had difficulty at first bending to prison regulations. But with sleep, proper nourishment, and enforced exercise, his health gradually improved. He even insisted that Shiloh residents drop <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing at 11:30 and 4:00 and exercise with him. He was made a gatekeeper and given a pass {{that allowed him to}} spend some time out of doors. He also volunteered to teach a group of prisoners how to read and write and especially enjoyed conducting a weekly Bible class that began with one student and grew to more than a hundred. Eventually Shiloh was allowed to send him a harp, and Sandford was not only able to practice, he gave at least two concerts at the prison.|$|E
500|$|Although the New York Dolls {{exhibited}} tongue-in-cheek qualities, Gary Graff {{observed a}} streetwise realism in the album's songs. In Christgau's opinion, Johansen's colloquial and morally superior lyrics were imbued with humor {{and a sense}} of human limits in songs whose fundamental theme was authenticity. This theme was explored in stories about lost youths, as on [...] "Subway Train", or in a study of a specific subject, such as the [...] "schizy imagemonger" [...] on [...] "Personality Crisis". He argued that beneath the band's decadent and campy surface were lyrics about [...] "the modern world... one nuclear bomb could blow it all away. Pills and personality crises weren't evils—easy, necessary, or <b>whatever.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> strategies and tropisms and positive pleasures". According to journalist Steve Taylor, [...] "Vietnamese Baby" [...] dealt with the impact of the Vietnam War at the time on everyday activities for people, whose fun was undermined by thoughts of collective guilt.|$|E

2500|$|Similar practices, some {{involving}} greater {{exposure and}} potential incrimination of the defendant, exist outside Europe and North America. Police in some Latin American countries have those arrested confess {{to the crime}} before the cameras. In Mexico, the equivalent practice is called a presentacion (Spanish for [...] "introduction"). Defendants suspected {{of involvement in the}} drug trade are posed for pictures surrounded by weapons, cash, and drugs, clothed in <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> wearing when arrested. Presentaciones have drawn criticisms similar to those directed at the perp walk.|$|E
2500|$|... "But {{there are}} two {{problems}} with this calculation. First, Daponte (who has studied Iraqi population figures for many years) questions the finding that prewar mortality was 5 deaths per 1,000. According to quite comprehensive data collected by the United Nations, Iraq's mortality rate from 1980–85 was 8.1 per 1,000. From 1985–90, the {{years leading up to}} the 1991 Gulf War, the rate declined to 6.8 per 1,000. After '91, the numbers are murkier, but clearly they went up. <b>Whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> in 2002, they were almost certainly higher than 5 per 1,000." ...|$|E

2500|$|The game {{begins on}} April 29, with the player (who remains unnamed) {{receiving}} {{a message from}} his brother, Pete Crowhurst, an architect working on the redevelopment of an abandoned train station and hotel in Dowerton, Dorset. Pete pleads for his brother to come to Dowerton, as something is wrong and he needs help. He mentions he is working with two ghost hunters, and says [...] "I think <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> hunting has found them. I think its found me too." [...] He then says [...] "it" [...] is outside the door, whispering his name, and he feels compelled to let it in. As the message ends, a door is heard opening.|$|E
2500|$|One of Kohn's {{most widely}} {{circulated}} articles is [...] "Five Reasons to Stop Saying 'Good Job!'" [...] which argues that praise, like {{other forms of}} extrinsic inducements, tends to undermine children's commitment to <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> praised for doing (i.e., children are taught to do things {{in order to get}} praise rather than do the things because it is right to do so, or because it is enjoyable to do so). [...] Later, he expanded this critique to suggest that positive reinforcement, like certain forms of punitive [...] "consequences," [...] amount to forms of conditional parenting, in which love is made contingent on pleasing or obeying the parent.|$|E
2500|$|Under the {{presidency}} of Valdas Adamkus, Lithuania actively promoted democracy in the formerly Soviet Eastern European and Asian nations. President Adamkus, together with President Aleksander Kwaśniewski, Javier Solana, Boris Gryzlov and Ján Kubiš, served as a mediator during Ukraine's political crisis, when two candidates in the 2004 presidential election, Viktor Yanukovych and Viktor Yushchenko, each claimed victory. President Adamkus recalled {{in an interview that}} [...] "when I asked what we could do to help, Kuchma said the friends of the Ukrainian people should drop <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> doing and come to Kiev immediately.". The next day international mediators met in Ukraine. The crisis was resolved after a new election was held.|$|E

2500|$|The {{circumstances}} which necessitated such fearful exertion on {{this and}} many other occasions in Mozart's life we have no means of ascertaining. <b>Whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> they {{were in accordance with}} a common custom of Nature. She seems to delight in condemning her most gifted sons to an ordeal the very reverse of that which we should anticipate. It seems equally true in Art and in Morals, that it is not by indulgence and favour, but by difficulty and trouble, that the spirit is formed; and in all ages of the world our Davids, Shakspeares, Dantes, Mozarts, and Beethovens must submit to processes which none but their great spirits could survive – to a fiery trial of poverty, ill health, neglect, and misunderstanding – and be [...] "tried as silver is tried," [...] that they may become the teachers of their fellow-men to all time, and shine, like stars in the firmament, for ever and ever.|$|E
