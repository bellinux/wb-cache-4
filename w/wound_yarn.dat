If yarn is repeatly laid on top of or along the same path as the {{previously}} <b>wound</b> <b>yarn,</b> this duplication of yarn path on the package creates a defect known as ribboning. The number of turns of package (n) per double traverse of yarn guide is calculated in two different way One is calculated the length of a coil on the package and total length of yarn in a double traverse; the other is considered transmission rate between drum and conical yarn package The result of two different approach is similar and the probable diameter of conical yarn package which ribboning is occurred is calculated and used on Schalafhorst-Autocore OE spinning machines...|$|E

The yarn layer, surface area, and mass of the yam package are formulated {{with respect to the}} diameters of the empty bobbin and full yarn package, yarn count, and yarn winding-on time. Based on the principles of dynamics and aerodynamics, models of the power requirements for overcoming the skin friction drag, increasing the kinetic energy of the yarn package (bobbin and <b>wound</b> <b>yarn),</b> and overcoming the yarn wind-on tension are developed. The skin friction coefficient on the surface of a rotating yam package is obtained from experiment. The power distribution during yam packaging is discussed based on a case study.

The energy required to overcome the yarn wind-on tension is also significant...|$|E
40|$|High energy {{consumption}} remains a key {{challenge for the}} widely used ring spinning system. Tackling this challenge requires {{a full understanding of}} the various factors that contribute to yarn tension and {{energy consumption}} during ring spinning. In this paper, we report our recent experimental and theoretical research on air drag, yarn tension and energy consumption in ring spinning. A specially constructed rig was used to simulate the ring spinning process; and yarn tension at the guide-eye was measured for different yarns under different conditions. The effect of yarn hairiness on the air drag acting on a rotating yarn package and on a ballooning yarn was examined. Models of the power requirements for overcoming the air drag, increasing the kinetic energy of the yarn package (bobbin and <b>wound</b> <b>yarn)</b> and overcoming the yarn wind-on tension were developed. The ratio of energy-consumption to yarn-production over a full yarn package was discussed. A program to simulate yarn winding in ring spinning was implemented, which can generate the balloon shape and predict yarn tension under a given spinning condition. The simulation results were verified with experimental results obtained from spinning cotton and wool yarns. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Nanotechnology and {{nanomaterials}} {{have the}} potential to revolutionize existing and create entirely new industries. Unique physical, mechanical, chemical, and biological properties of nanomaterials have been extensively documented in the last two decades. However, most nanomaterials are discontinuous in nature, creating problems with their processing and manipulation into devices and raising health concerns. Continuous nanofibers represent an emerging class of nanomaterials with critical advantages to applications. Continuous nanofibers are readily produced by electrospinning process comprising spinning polymer solutions in high electric fields. Electrospinning is a very economic top-down nanomanufacturing process that has been used to produce ultrafine continuous nanofibers from several hundred polymers, ceramics, carbon, and metals. The process allows integrated electromechanical nanofiber alignment and assembly into macroscopic 2 D and 3 D nanostructures. One issue with the classical single-jet electrospinning is its low production rate insufficient for most industrial applications. The objective of this research was to design, develop, study, and optimize a novel hybrid nanomanufacturing process for high-rate production of quality polymer nanofibers. The process combined centrifugal mechanical and electrical forces in an integrated single-step fashion. Initial design, development, and testing of the hybrid process were conducted. Comprehensive systematic parametric studies were performed on two important polymers, i. e. polyethylene oxide and polyacrylonitrile. Optimal parameters were determined for attaining the highest nanofiber production rate while maintaining high quality of the nanofibers. Nanofiber deposition density was studied and methods for obtaining a consistent deposition were determined. Exploratory analysis of several advanced process configurations, including configurations resulting in aligned nanofibers, <b>wound</b> nanofiber <b>yarns,</b> and nanofiber deposits on non-electroded surfaces was performed. The results demonstrated the feasibility of hybrid nanomanufacturing of high quality nanofibers with significant increases in nanofiber production rates, in comparison with the single-jet electrospinning. Integrated high-rate nanomanufacturing of aligned nanofiber sheets, <b>wound</b> <b>yarns,</b> and nanofilamentary deposits on non-electroded surfaces were also successfully demonstrated for the first time. The obtained results can be used to manufacture nanofibers for a broad range of applications spanning structural materials, composites, and energy, environmental, and biomedical applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of electrospun poly(var epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) fibres between two collection rings is described, and {{the conversion of}} these fibres into a multi-filament yarn of is demonstrated. During electrospinning, when two grounded rings are placed equidistantly from the spinneret, an array of fibres is formed between the collection rings. These rapidly produced fibres are three-dimensionally suspended in air, and demonstrate low incidence of fibre splitting when lower voltages are applied. Such electrospun fibres, with a diameter of 1. 26 ± 0. 19 ?m and a length between 40 and 100 mm, were oriented and continuous. Furthermore, manufacture of the fibre array was easily achievable, reproducible and not subject to relatively small changes in spinneret-ground distance or applied voltage.

40|$|Wound {{filters are}} quite {{popular in the}} {{domestic}} water purification systems. The performance of these filters {{is based on the}} distinctive yarn and winding variables. Yarn used for filtration application is normally produced on DREF spinning system. Several researchers have reported the influence of DREF spinning variables on yarn properties. However none of them are in context of filtration application. Since elucidation of influence of winding parameters on the filter performance has already been reported; it thus becomes intriguing to explore the influence of spinning suction pressure on filtration behavior. Yarn spun at different suction pressures was used to produce wound filter cartridges, keeping winding variables unchanged. Filters <b>wound</b> using <b>yarn</b> spun at higher spinning suction pressure resulted in greater pressure drop but showed better micron rating. However the pressure drop encountered also affects the retention capacity of the wound filter. The outcome of this study helps in establishing the relation between spinning suction pressure and performance parameters of wound filters. Design expert® software was used to develop regression equations to predict performance of wound filter for the given spinning suction pressure which is of practical significance for yarn and filter manufacturers, without performing filter test...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the onset}} of a thunderstorm, {{according}} to Nikola's own description, he felt a great excitement; he heard some music in the thunder, all his muscles tightened, and something made him go. He would take a sickle and a scythe, a warp beam on which a twin sister had <b>wound</b> warp <b>yarns,</b> the bag with the last-year's pellets, and the bottle with last-year's dew. With this he would run directly toward the cloud, looking neither left nor right, nor watching where he treads. Once on the field, Nikola would stick the scythe into the ground, and say a prayer for lightning to strike. Having gone away from the scythe, he would make {{the sign of the}} cross with the warp beam in the direction of the cloud, to break it into quarters. Further beneath it, he would shake the cloud apart using the pellets and dew. There he also addressed the souls of the drowned and hanged leading the cloud, praying them that the [...] "rain like this dew" [...] fall, and spoke various other prayers. For these protective services, Nikola had been receiving wheat and maize from his fellow villagers. He was eventually warned by the authorities to stop with these activities, branded backward superstition by them.|$|R
25|$|Spinning is {{the final}} stage in {{converting}} wool to worsted yarns, the roving being drawn out to its final thickness and twist added for strength. There are three types of spinning machine or frame in common use in the United Kingdom, namely flyer, cap and ring. Another machine used for spinning worsted yarns is the worsted mule. All three types of machine or frame are similar in their method of drawing out or drafting the roving to make the required count or thickness, but differ {{in the way in}} which twist is imparted and the <b>yarn</b> <b>wound</b> onto the bobbin. Drafting takes place between the back and front rollers. The front rollers revolve faster than the back ones, drawing out the roving to the fineness of yarn required. Between the rollers are carriers which support and help to control the fibres as they are being drafted.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe unidirection {{composites}} of jute spun yarn/Polylactic acid were fabricated using compression molding. The reinforcement fibers were paralleled with matrix resin {{fiber and}} {{were used as}} intermediate materials to prepare the unidrection preforms. The parallel yarn was winded onto the metallic frame. The <b>wound</b> paralleled <b>yarns</b> were dried in convection oven before molding. The metallic frame containing the paralleled yarns was placed in heated mold for consolidation to produce the unidirection composite specimens with various molding temperature. The heated mold was cooled by the cooling system of the compression machine. Consolidation process involved three stages. At first, under certain temperature, the solid fibrous matrix materials became softened and then the matrix in the liquid form soaked and infiltrated the reinforcing fibers and finally during cooling stage, the matrix turned into solid form to hold the fibers in a definite position. The molding temperature was affected to the mechanical properties of the unidirection composite. The jute spun yarn/PLA composite were characterized in the term of mechanical properties and the fabrication quality was examined by cross-section observation. The impregnation quality and dispersion of fiber bundle were increased with increasing the molding temperature and achievement ratio of elastic modulus increase. While increasing the molding temperature, the achievement ratio of tensile strength was decreased because of deterioration of jute fiber. The optimum compression molding temperature was 185 - 195 C for fabricated the jute spun yarn/PLA unidirection composite...|$|R
40|$|Pirn winding is an {{operation}} of winding yarn from supply yarn package onto pirns {{which are used}} for shuttle weft insertion. As the package size varies when winding pirns, the varying balloon effect caused to change the thread tension at the winding point of the pirn. As a number of pirns can be wound from a single supply yarn package, pirns are <b>wound</b> from different <b>yarn</b> package diameters. A significant change in take off tension takes place from pirn to pirn. Placing dead weights on the disc tension controller which adds a tension to take off tension may help to compensate the yarn tension variation to some extent. However, incorrect timing of compensation and stepwise compensation may create significant tension variations in pirn windings. The authors attempted to design a tension control device by applying an automatically continuously varying electromagnetic force on the dead weight, so that the variation of take off tension due to change of package diameter is compensated and investigate influence of varying supply yarn package diameter on the fmal winding tens ion of pirn...|$|R
40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} multispectral {{imaging system}} can directly acquire the reflectance {{of a single}} strand of yarn that is impossible for traditional spectrophotometers. Instead, the spectrophotometric reflectance of a yarn winding, which is constituted by <b>yarns</b> <b>wound</b> on a background card, {{is regarded as the}} yarn reflectance in textile. While multispectral imaging systems and spectrophotometers can be separately used to acquire the reflectance of a single strand of yarn and corresponding yarn winding, the quantitative relationship between them is not yet known. In this paper, the relationship is established based on models that describe the spectral response of a spectrophotometer to a yarn winding and that of a multispectral imaging system to a single strand of yarn. The reflectance matching function from a single strand of yarn to corresponding yarn winding is derived to be a second degree polynomial function, which coefficients are the solutions of a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. Experiments on 100 pairs of samples show that the proposed approach can reduce the color difference between yarn windings and single strands of yarns from 2. 449 to 1. 082 CIEDE 2000 units. The coefficients of the optimal reflection matching function imply that the reflectance of a yarn winding measured by a spectrophotometer consists of not only the intrinsic reflectance of yarn but also the nonignorable interreflection component between yarns.

40|$|Introduction. The {{protozoan}} parasite Giardia {{is one of}} {{the important}} biological cotaminants in water. lts presence in water has caused the outbreak of a number of epidemics in various part of the world including the United States. The major impediment in detecting this particular parasite is unavailability of suitable filters capable of removing it from water. Regarding the fact <b>yarn</b> <b>wound</b> filters (cartridge) used in removing Giardia under laboratory condition are currently difficult to obtain in Iran, attempts were made to design and manufacture the filters according to standards recommended in the literature. &# 13; Methods. To determine the efficiency of filters manufactured in this way, a pilot system was established and parameters of concern were investigated. A given number of cysts were introduced in each case to the water in the pilot tank after being counted on the hemocytometer lamella After the entire tank water (at least 4001) had been pumped through the filters, the filter were removed from the pilot system to have their yarns separated and washed. The cysts recovered were then counted and compared with the original input cysts to determine the efficiency of the filters. Formation of sediments on filters due to suspended solids in water was a great impediment in counting the cysts hidden in the sediments. To overcome this difficulty, the method of floatation in sucrose was used to remove the hidden cysts from the sediments. &# 13; Regarding the morphological characteristics of the cysts, the method was also studied in terms of the sucrose film concentration and the effects of centrifugal speed and duration on the removal of cysts from sediments. &# 13; Results. The results indicated an efficiency of 80. 69 ± 5. 85, which was ideal for a first experience in Iran. a level of 2. 5 molar of Sucrose with a duration of 10 minutes for the centrifugation time at 2, 000 rpm were considered to be optimum levels to yield a certainty of 95 percent and an efficiency of 89. 95 ± 4. 25. &# 13; Discussion. The comparison of the efficiency obtained with those obtained across the world from the application of other techniques associated with this method indicated that this filter was advantages to similar filters, keeping in mind also that this filter can be used in field situations. It is essential to modify in each region the method of cyst removal from sediments using Sucrose gradient according to the particular morphological characteristics and density of cystes. The optimization of Sucrose gradient and the centrifugation duration and speed seems equally important...|$|R
