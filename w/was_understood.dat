5|$|In December 1970 Gomułka {{scored a}} major {{political}} victory when Poland obtained a West German recognition of the post-World War II borders. The German side secured the right to emigrate to West Germany for the residents of Poland of German identity and to help financially those who stayed by granting pensions: hundreds of thousands eventually became affected. German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who signed the agreement, also asked on his knees for forgiveness for the crimes of the Nazis (Warschauer Kniefall). His gesture <b>was</b> <b>understood</b> in Poland as being addressed to all Poles, although it was actually made {{at the site of}} the Warsaw Ghetto and was thus directed primarily toward the Jews. The notable reconciliation process between the Polish and German nations was initiated five years earlier, when the Polish Church issued its famous Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops, criticized then by the Polish government.|$|E
5|$|In {{getting the}} Philippine Army ready for war, MacArthur faced an {{enormous}} task. On {{a visit to}} the United States in 1937, MacArthur lobbied the Navy Department for the development of PT boats—small, fast boats armed with torpedoes—for which he believed that the geography of the Philippines, with its shallow waters and many coves, was ideally suited. The nascent Philippine Navy acquired three, known as Q boats, after President Manuel L. Quezon. In August 1941, the U.S. Navy created Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three, under the command of Lieutenant (junior grade) John D. Bulkeley. It was a half-strength squadron, with only six PT boats instead of the normal twelve, numbered 31 to 35 and 41. It arrived at Manila in September 1941. It <b>was</b> <b>understood</b> that a fleet consisting of more than PT boats would be required for a successful defense of the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|In his 1928 {{paper on}} the species, Lowe thought that the Inaccessible Island rail was the {{descendant}} of flightless ancestors which had reached Inaccessible Island via a land bridge or sunken continent such as Lemuria.

By 1955 it <b>was</b> <b>understood</b> that the rail was the descendant of ancestors that had flown to Inaccessible Island.

5|$|Sir Jonah Barrington {{was born}} in 1760 near Abbeyleix in the Queen's County (Co. Laois). He was first elected to Parliament as a member for Tuam in 1790. He lost this seat in 1798 and was elected as a member for Banagher in 1799. He voted against the Act of Union in 1801 {{and as a result}} he was {{deprived}} of his £1,000 a year sinecure in the Customs House and this also stopped his further advancement. In 1809 he published, in five parts, the first volume of the Historic Memoirs of Ireland. It is thought that he was induced to delay the second volume – the English government shrinking from the exposure of their conduct in carrying the Act of Union, and it <b>was</b> <b>understood</b> that to purchase his silence he was permitted to reside in France from about 1815.|$|E
5|$|Skyscraper Museum {{director}} Carol Willis, and art consultant Franck Mercurio, {{curator at}} the Field Museum in Chicago, offer moderating modern views {{about the influence of}} Saarinen's design. Willis notes that setback architecture was being implemented in New York City highrises because of 1916 zoning ordinances related to building height and sunlight, and that Saarinen's design <b>was</b> <b>understood</b> to be an embodiment of this trend. Mercurio points to the Tribune Tower competition entry from American architect Bertram Goodhue as having the same modernist features as Saarinen's, with dramatic setbacks but a more pronounced simplification of the exterior. Mercurio argues that Goodhue's design is a better example of modernism because it has less ornamentation. Goodhue's entry gained him honorable mention but no cash award.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese convoy was {{a result}} of a Japanese Imperial General Headquarters {{decision}} in December 1942 to reinforce their position in the South West Pacific. A plan was devised to move some 6,900 troops from Rabaul directly to Lae. The plan <b>was</b> <b>understood</b> to be risky, because Allied air power in the area was strong, but it was decided to proceed because otherwise the troops would have to be landed a considerable distance away and march through inhospitable swamp, mountain and jungle terrain without roads before reaching their destination. On 28 February 1943, the convoy – comprising eight destroyers and eight troop transports with an escort of approximately 100 fighters – set out from Simpson Harbour in Rabaul.|$|E

Hartz {{as their}} {{principal}} client, filed the first US Agent Orange class-action lawsuit, in Pennsylvania in 1980, for the injuries military personnel in Vietnam suffered through exposure to toxic dioxins in the defoliant.

Hartz's deposition {{was one of the}} first ever taken in America, and the first for an Agent Orange trial, for the purpose of preserving testimony at trial, as it <b>was</b> <b>understood</b> that Hartz would not live to see the trial because of a brain tumor that began to develop while he was a member of Tiger Force, Special Forces, and LRRPs in Vietnam. The firm also located and supplied critical research to the Veterans' lead expert, Dr. Codario, including about 100 articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade, as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed, what the effects of dioxin had been on animals and humans, and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or dioxin was a contaminant of some chemical reaction.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and population genetics. In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria, along with the {{discovery of}} the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics. From the 1950s to present times, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The genetic code was cracked by Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg after DNA <b>was</b> <b>understood</b> to contain codons. Finally, the Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human genome. This project was essentially completed in 2003, with further analysis still being published.
