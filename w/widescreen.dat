The VHS edition came in three versions—pan and scan, pan and scan with an affixed Giant toy to the clamshell case, and a <b>widescreen</b> version. All of the initial <b>widescreen</b> home video releases were in 1.85:1, the incorrect aspect ratio for the film.

5|$|Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories is a 1992 {{animation}} {{directed by}} Ray Messecar and narrated by John Lithgow (later released and cropped to <b>widescreen</b> format on Blu-Ray part of Who's Who in the Dr. Seuss?).|$|E
5|$|After these disappointments, Pioneer Pictures {{released}} a short film in three-strip technicolor called La Cucaracha which was well received. The film won an Academy Award in 1934. Pioneer released the first full-length technicolor film, Becky Sharp in 1935.

5|$|By 1955 the {{original}} sound negatives began to deteriorate, though a four-track copy had survived in good condition. Using the remaining Fantasound {{system at the}} studio, a three-track stereo copy was transferred across telephone wires onto magnetic film at an RCA facility in Hollywood. This copy was used when Fantasia was reissued in stereo by Buena Vista Distribution in SuperScope, a derivative of the anamorphic <b>widescreen</b> CinemaScope format, on February 7, 1956. The projector featured an automatic control mechanism designed by Disney engineers that was coupled to a variable anamorphic lens, which allowed the picture to switch between its Academy standard aspect ratio of 1.33:1 to the wide ratio of 2.35:1 in twenty seconds without {{a break in the}} film. This was achieved by placing the cues that controlled the mechanism on a separate track in addition to the three audio channels. Only selected parts of the animation were stretched, while all live action scenes remained unchanged. This reissue garnered some criticism from viewers, as the <b>widescreen</b> format led to the cropping and reframing of the images.|$|E
5|$|Capcom later {{announced}} that the remaster will be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on December 12, 2017 worldwide. The Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version include both digital and retail editions, while the Xbox One version will be digital-only in Japan.

5|$|Combinations also trigger special modes, {{including}} alternative camera angles, {{a sniper}} mode, and a snapshot mode, which unlocks more in-game secrets. Playable {{versions of the}} 1981 Donkey Kong and 1983 Jetpac are hidden within the game. The player-character can also ride animals, such as a rhino and swordfish, who recur from earlier series games. Optional hardware support includes a <b>widescreen</b> mode and Rumble Pak compatibility.|$|E
5|$|Early in production, Warner Bros. {{decided to}} release Phantasm as a {{theatrical}} release, rather than straight to video. That left {{less than a}} year for production time (most animated features take well over two years from finished story to final release). Due to this decision, the animators went over the scenes in order to accommodate the <b>widescreen</b> theatrical aspect ratio. The studio cooperated well, granting the filmmakers a large amount of creative control.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to official localizations, {{for example the}} one by CD Projekt for the Polish market, fan communities developed Spanish, Hungarian, and Italian fan translations of the game. When Interplay dropped support for Planescape: Torment after the official 1.1 patch, several not yet fixed bugs were corrected by fan created unofficial patches. Other mods add back items and quests omitted from {{the final version of}} the game or new features such as <b>widescreen</b> support.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{the motion}} picture {{industry}} was threatened by the advent of television—TV kept moviegoers at home, reducing box office revenues. Film studios sought to lure audiences to theaters with attractions that television could not provide. These included a revival of color films, three-dimensional films, stereophonic sound, and <b>widescreen</b> movies. Cinerama {{was one of the}} first <b>widescreen</b> movie processes of the era. In its initial conception, the cumbersome system required three cameras for shooting and three synchronized projectors to display a picture on one wide, curved screen. Along with the logistical and financial challenges of tripling equipment usage and cost, the process led to distracting vertical lines between the three projected images. Looking for a high-impact method of <b>widescreen</b> filmmaking that was cheaper, simpler, and less visually distracting, 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to a process it branded CinemaScope: in this system, the film was shot with anamorphic lenses. The film was then exhibited with a complementary anamorphic lens on the projector that expanded the image, creating a projected aspect ratio (the ratio of the image's width to its height) twice that of the image area on the physical frame of film. By the time the first CinemaScope movie—The Robe (1953)—was announced for production, Gottschalk, Moore and Nicholson had a demo reel of work with their anamorphic underwater system.|$|E
5|$|Miracle at St. Anna was {{released}} on DVD and Blu-ray disc formats by Touchstone Home Entertainment on February 10, 2009.

Upon its release on DVD, Miracle at St. Anna debuted in eighth place, selling 142,782 units in its first week. In North America, the film has grossed $10.1 million from DVD sales.|$|E
5|$|Sales were satisfactory, and the {{development}} of sequels began almost immediately after The Witcher release. The team began the design work for The Witcher 2 , and experimented with consoles to develop a new engine for The Witcher 3. Their development was halted when the team began work on , a console version of The Witcher. Although they collaborated with French studio <b>Widescreen</b> Games for the console port, it entered development limbo. <b>Widescreen</b> demanded more manpower, money and time to develop the title, complaining that they were not being paid; according to Iwiński, CD Projekt paid them more than their own staff members. The team cancelled the project, suspending its development. Unhappy with the decision, Atari demanded that CD Projekt repay them for funding the console port development and Iwiński agreed that Atari would be the North American publisher of the sequel of The Witcher 2. CD Projekt acquired Metropolis Software in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{initially}} released in two sets in United Kingdom: the first twelve episodes were released as a <b>widescreen</b> four-disc DVD box set on July 17, 2006.

5|$|Because Corman did {{not believe}} that The Little Shop of Horrors had much {{financial}} prospect after its initial theatrical run, he did not bother to copyright it, resulting in the film falling into the public domain. Because of this, the film is widely available in copies of varying quality. The film was originally screened theatrically in the <b>widescreen</b> aspect ratio of 1.85:1, but has largely only been seen in open matte at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 since its original theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|Carnivàle: The Complete First Season was {{released}} as a <b>widescreen</b> six-disc Region 1 DVD box set on December 7, 2004, {{one month before}} the premiere of the second season.

5|$|Derek Meddings {{and a team}} of 28 {{technicians}} {{completed the}} special effects shots for the film in six months.

Over 300 effects shot were completed with scale models. The team made use of the extra space afforded to them by the new special effects building to experiment with floor-level shots and other more creative camera angles.|$|E
5|$|Film {{historian}} Howard Hughes suggests that, {{despite the}} implications of a large budget {{as a result of}} an international cast, as well as elaborate set and costume designs, there are several aspects that suggest otherwise. These include several continuity errors and revealing mistakes present throughout the film, and a variance in the quality of the film stock. In comparison to the Technicolor/Techniscope presentation most Spaghetti Westerns were filmed in, The Great Silence was filmed in the standard European <b>widescreen</b> format and printed in Eastmancolor.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, Resident Evil was ported to the GameCube's successor, the Wii, {{along with}} Resident Evil Zero. The port, titled Resident Evil Archives: Resident Evil, {{features}} a control system that supports both the Wii Remote and the GameCube controller. Although Capcom originally {{had no plans}} to release the Wii version outside Japan, arguing that the game would not sell very well, the game was eventually released in North America and Europe in June 2009 due to the commercial success of Resident Evil 5. The Wii version received generally favorable reviews from critics, but some publications criticized it for its outdated controls, lack of new features, and lack of <b>widescreen</b> support.|$|E
