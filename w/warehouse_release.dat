5000|$|The Cape of Good Hope {{was first}} settled by Europeans {{under the auspices}} of the Dutch East India Company (also known by its Dutch {{initials}} VOC), which established a victualing station there in 1652 to provide its outward bound fleets with fresh provisions and a harbour of refuge during the long sea journey from Europe to Asia. Since the primary purpose of the Cape settlement at the time was to stock provisions for passing Dutch ships, the VOC offered grants of farmland to its employees under the condition they would cultivate grain for company <b>warehouses,</b> and <b>released</b> them from their contracts to save on their wages. Prospective employees had to be married Dutch citizens, considered [...] "of good character" [...] by the Company, and had to commit to spending at least twenty years on the African continent. They were issued with a letter of freedom, known as a [...] "vrijbrief", which released them from company service, and received farms of thirteen and a half morgen each. However, the new farmers were also subject to heavy restrictions: they were ordered to focus on cultivating grain, and each year their harvest was to be sold exclusively to Dutch officials at fixed prices. They were forbidden from growing tobacco, producing vegetables for any purpose other than personal consumption, or purchasing cattle from the native tribes at rates which differed from those set by the Company. With time, these restrictions and other attempts by the colonial authorities to control the European population resulted in successive generations of settlers and their descendants becoming increasingly localised in their loyalties and national identity and hostile towards the colonial government.|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: Automated {{measurements}} of electrocardiographic (ECG) intervals {{are widely used}} by clinicians for individual patient diagnosis and by investigators in population studies. We examined whether clinically significant systematic differences exist in ECG intervals measured by current generation digital electrocardiographs from different manufacturers and whether differences, if present, are dependent {{on the degree of}} abnormality of the selected ECGs. Methods Measurements of RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval were made blindly by 4 major manufacturers of digital electrocardiographs used in the United States from 600 XML files of ECG tracings stored in the US FDA ECG <b>warehouse</b> and <b>released</b> {{for the purpose of this}} study by the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium. Included were 3 groups based on expected QT interval and degree of repolarization abnormality, comprising 200 ECGs each from (1) placebo or baseline study period in normal subjects during thorough QT studies, (2) peak moxifloxacin effect in otherwise normal subjects during thorough QT studies, and (3) patients with genotyped variants of congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). Results Differences of means between manufacturers were generally small in the normal and moxifloxacin subjects, but in the LQTS patients, differences of means ranged from 2. 0 to 14. 0 ms for QRS duration and from 0. 8 to 18. 1 ms for the QT interval. Mean absolute differences between algorithms were similar for QRS duration and QT intervals in the normal and in the moxifloxacin subjects (mean ≤ 6 ms) but were significantly larger in patients with LQTS. Conclusions Small but statistically significant group differences in mean interval and duration measurements and means of individual absolute differences exist among automated algorithms of widely used, current generation digital electrocardiographs. Measurement differences, including QRS duration and the QT interval, are greatest for the most abnormal ECGs...|$|R
5000|$|The Cape of Good Hope {{was first}} settled by Europeans {{under the auspices}} of the Dutch East India Company (also known by its Dutch {{initials}} VOC), which established a victualing station there in 1652 to provide its outward bound fleets with fresh provisions and a harbour of refuge during the long sea journey from Europe to Asia. In a few short decades, the Cape had become home to a large population of [...] "vrijlieden", also denoted as [...] "vrijburgers" [...] (free citizens), former Company employees who remained in Dutch territories overseas after completing their contracts. Since the primary purpose of the Cape settlement at the time was to stock provisions for passing Dutch ships, the VOC offered grants of farmland to its employees under the condition they would cultivate grain for the Company <b>warehouses,</b> and <b>released</b> them from their contracts to save on their wages. Vrijburgers were granted tax exempt status for twelve years and loaned all the necessary seeds and farming implements they requested. They were married Dutch citizens, considered [...] "of good character" [...] by the Company, and had to commit to spending at least twenty years on the African continent. Reflecting the multi-national character of the VOC's workforce, some German soldiers and sailors were also considered for vrijburger status as well, and in 1688 the Dutch government sponsored the resettlement of over a hundred French Huguenot refugees at the Cape. As a result, by 1691 over a quarter of the colony's European population was not ethnically Dutch. Nevertheless, there was a degree of cultural assimilation due to intermarriage, and the almost universal adoption of the Dutch language. Cleavages were likelier to occur along social and economic lines; broadly speaking, the Cape colonists were delineated into Boers, poor farmers who settled directly on the frontier, and the more affluent, predominantly urbanised Cape Dutch.|$|R
5000|$|Two singles were {{released}} to promote Ready Set Go!.

However, after Travis Porter incorrectly credited him as a guest on the song instead of the lead when it appeared on Travis Porter's mixtape I'm a Differenter 2 (and subsequently performed it without him on numerous occasions) Dash fell out with the group after their promises to rectify the error did not materialize, and removed them from the song. On the advice of L.A. da Boomman, Dash then requested rapper Soulja Boy record a verse from a song, who was so desperate to perform on the song that he protested his case via Twitter to make the appearance. The final version, which features additional production from K.E. On the Track, was released to digital retailers on January 22, 2010, and reached number 46 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 18 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number eight on the Hot Rap Songs chart.

He founded the company in April 1981 to publish his fantasy role-playing game, but had insufficient funds to publish any books; the mother of Bill Loebs loaned Siembieda $1,500 to publish his first RPG book, The Mechanoid Invasion (1981). By 1983 the company was successful enough for Siembieda to rent <b>warehouse</b> space and <b>release</b> his fantasy RPG, the Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing Game with a loan of $10,000 from his friend Thom Bartold who had also loaned him funds to print the other two books in the Mechanoid Trilogy, Journey and Homeworld in 1982. These were not just loans, but investments, and Siembieda established a system of paying royalties {{not just to the}} writers and artists, but also to those who lent him the capital needed to print the books: his investors. The following year, he extended his Palladium system to the superhero genre with Heroes Unlimited. A freelancer contacted Siembieda about producing a licensed role-playing game based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic book. Siembieda obtained the rights, but was dissatisfied with the freelancer's product. Erick Wujcik redesigned the game in five weeks, and it was published in 1985 as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles & Other Strangeness. Siembieda next obtained the license to publish a game based on the Robotech anime series, designing the Robotech role-playing game published in 1986.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{realistic}} replenishment model with multiple warehouses (one is primary warehouse (PW) {{from where the}} items are sold and others are secondary warehouses (SWs) where the items are stored) is developed with fuzzy lead-time {{under the assumption that}} the capacities of the warehouses are finite. Inflation and time value of money are taken into account. The items of secondary warehouses are transported to the primary <b>warehouse</b> in continuous <b>release</b> pattern and associated transportation cost is proportional to the distance from PW to SWs. The holding cost of items in SWs has reverse effect with distance. Here, the demand of items is a deterministic function of selling price and the displayed inventory. Deterioration rates of the items are constant and different in different warehouses. The replenishment rate is infinite and the problem is constructed with shortages, which are the mixture of back orders and lost sales. The backlogged demand is assumed to be a function of currently backlogged amount. When an item is out of stock, the loyal and captive customers will wait until the outstanding orders arrive and are served. To compensate the inconvenience of backordering and to secure orders, the supplier may offer a price discount on the stock out item. There are three scenarios depending upon the time when the new order is placed for the next cycle. The problem is illustrated with the help of numerical examples...|$|R
40|$|Inventory {{management}} is today {{seen as more}} competitive oriented, process oriented and better integrated into the companies than before. But still do several companies run their inventories according a traditional approach. There is therefore a need for some companies to evaluate their inventory management and adapt the new view. There is also a need to adjust for increased focus on sustainability, previous research calls for strategies and tools that include sustainable parameters without lowering the profitability. The purpose with {{this study is to}} assess inventory management principles and purchasing routines related to the acquisition of packaging material in a process industry. The study aims to develop a framework for decision makers in inventory management. This framework will be the basis for a support tool incorporating a relatively simple and easy-to-use user interface. This master thesis is performed as a case study research and uses several data collection methods, such as a literature review, observations, and interviews. The findings from the data collection is used to evaluate which impact inventory management has on a company’s profitability, and which basic parameters that could be included in the support tool. The empirical findings show that Barilla Sweden’s current inventory management match the traditional approach, but also that they strive to become more competitive and process oriented in their management of inventories. There is however some constraints in their working strategy that prevents them from taking the next step. Comparison between Barilla Sweden’s current order size and an economical order quantity (EOQ) and just-in-time (JIT) approach is made. The comparison shows that Barilla Sweden has money to save and <b>warehouse</b> space to <b>release</b> with changed order quantities. Adapting a new inventory management approach require review of uncertainties, such as delivery accuracy and forecast changes. It is also necessary to evaluate supplier relations and internal working strategies. The effect of these parameters on inventory management can be noticed in the support tool. The tool compares total costs, average stock, tied capital, and environmental and social consequences between the EOQ model and JIT. The support tool visualizes drawbacks and benefits with different order sizes and has an easy-to-use interface...|$|R
