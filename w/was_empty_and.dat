The McDonald Ranch House <b>was</b> <b>empty</b> <b>and</b> deteriorating until 1982, when it was stabilized by the Army. In 1984 it was restored by the National Park Service to appear as it did on July 12, 1945. The site is now open to visitors twice a year, on the first Saturday in April and October.|$|E
5|$|Substantial combat {{had ended}} {{but the war}} had not, and a formal treaty of peace was months away. The British still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah, and had a {{powerful}} fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782–83. Money matters fed the anxiety; the treasury <b>was</b> <b>empty,</b> <b>and</b> the unpaid soldiers were growing restive {{almost to the point}} of mutiny. At one point, they forced an adjournment of the Congress from Philadelphia to Princeton. Washington dispelled unrest among officers by suppressing the Newburgh Conspiracy in March 1783, and Congress came up with the promise of a five-year bonus.|$|E

25|$|Jain Muni Vidyavijayaji visited Sindh in 1937. He {{notes that}} the temple <b>was</b> <b>empty,</b> <b>and</b> had decayed. A local Bhil served as a guard. At that time there were still many Jain {{families}} in towns near Nagarparkar. During India's partition in 1947, the Jains left and the temple became inaccessible to the Jain community.|$|E

25|$|Anderson {{was then}} {{appointed}} on 20 October 1932 as the Governor of Newfoundland. He became His Majesty's Representative {{at a time}} of great instability in the Dominion of Newfoundland.

25|$|Washington {{could not}} know that the British would not reopen {{hostilities}} after Yorktown. They still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah, together with a powerful fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782–83. The treasury <b>was</b> <b>empty,</b> <b>and</b> the unpaid soldiers were growing restive, {{almost to the point of}} mutiny or possible coup d'état. The unrest among officers of the Newburgh Conspiracy was personally dispelled by Washington in 1783, and Congress subsequently created the promise of a five years bonus for all officers.|$|E
25|$|Teardrop Park sits midblock, {{near the}} corner of Warren Street and River Terrace. Before construction, the site <b>was</b> <b>empty</b> <b>and</b> flat; part of the neighborhood's {{development}} plan, the park was designed in anticipation of four high residential towers on its west and east. Although a New York City public park, maintenance is overseen by the Battery Park City Parks Conservancy and the park was designed for the Battery Park City Authority. The park opened on September 30, 2004. There is also a southern extension to this park.|$|E
25|$|For {{the rest}} of the summer, York held the king prisoner, either in Hertford castle or in London (to be enthroned in Parliament in July). When Parliament met again in November, the throne <b>was</b> <b>empty,</b> <b>and</b> it was {{reported}} that the king was ill again. York resumed the office of Protector; although he surrendered it when the king recovered in February 1456, it seemed that this time Henry was willing to accept that York and his supporters would play a major part in the government of the realm.|$|E

25|$|Kléber {{emerged as}} {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} greatest generals of the French revolutionary epoch. Though he distrusted his powers and declined the responsibility of supreme command, there is nothing in his career to show that he would have been unequal to it. As a second-in-command no general of his time excelled him. His conduct of affairs in Egypt, {{at a time when the}} treasury <b>was</b> <b>empty</b> <b>and</b> the troops were discontented for want of pay, shows that his powers as an administrator were little – if at all – inferior to those he possessed as a general.|$|E
25|$|The {{group that}} landed at Le Touquet had the Merlimont Plage Hotel as an objective. Intelligence had {{suggested}} that the Germans were using the hotel as a barracks. When the group reached the hotel they discovered it <b>was</b> <b>empty</b> <b>and</b> {{the doors and windows}} boarded up. Unable to find another target, they returned to the beach, only to discover their boat had put back out to sea. During the wait, two German sentries stumbled on the group and were quietly killed by the troops' bayonets. Another German patrol then approached across the sand dunes and the group was forced to swim out to the boat, leaving its weapons behind.|$|E
25|$|Castle Vale Secondary School {{opened in}} newly constructed, {{purpose-built}} premises in 1967, although {{the buildings were}} completed and officially opened in 1969. At its peak in the early 1970s, it had 1,100 students, but this declined to 362 students by 1993 as truancy became widespread problem on the estate. Half of the building <b>was</b> <b>empty</b> <b>and</b> this space was occupied by the Castle Vale Housing Action Trust. As the HAT neared {{the end of its}} life, the school needed to reoccupy this space as demand started to increase again. The school's reputation was completely changed during the HAT's existence and the school now has waiting lists for prospective students.|$|E

25|$|Piribauer {{tried to}} have Wittgenstein arrested, but the village's police station <b>was</b> <b>empty,</b> <b>and</b> when he tried again {{the next day he}} was told Wittgenstein had disappeared. On 28 April 1926, Wittgenstein handed in his {{resignation}} to Wilhelm Kundt, a local school inspector, who tried to persuade him to stay; however, Wittgenstein was adamant that his days as a schoolteacher were over. Proceedings were initiated in May, and the judge ordered a psychiatric report; in August 1926 a letter to Wittgenstein from a friend, Ludwig Hänsel, indicates that hearings were ongoing, but nothing is known about the case after that. Alexander Waugh writes that Wittgenstein's family and their money may have had a hand in covering things up. Waugh writes that Haidbauer died shortly afterwards of haemophilia; Monk says he died when he was 14 of leukaemia.|$|E
25|$|Representatives of the Three Emperors {{met again}} in Berlin, where they {{approved}} the Berlin Memorandum. To convince the Herzegovinians, the Memorandum suggested that international representatives {{be allowed to}} oversee the institution of reforms in the rebelling provinces. But before the Memorandum could {{be approved by the}} Porte, the Ottoman Empire was convulsed by internal strife, which led to the deposition of Sultan Abdul-Aziz. The new Sultan, Murad V, was himself deposed three months later due to his mental instability, bringing Abdul Hamid II to power. In the meantime, the hardships of the Ottomans had increased; their treasury <b>was</b> <b>empty,</b> <b>and</b> they faced an insurrection not only in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also in Serbia, Montenegro and Bulgaria (the so-called April uprising). Still, the Ottoman Empire managed to crush the insurgents in August 1876. The result incommoded Russia, which had planned to take possession of various Ottoman territories in Southeastern Europe {{in the course of the}} conflict.|$|E
25|$|On 25 July 200 P-40s {{were given}} to the Soviet Union by Winston Churchill in order to aid the country's air defences. As a naval strategist, the Far North appealed to Churchill for intervention. He sent the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) to conduct an attack on Finnish bases at Kirkenes and Petsamo. On 30 July the {{aircraft}} carrier Victorious and Furious were dispatched to deliver the strike forces. Nine Fairey Albacores of 817 Squadron, nine Fairey Swordfish from 812 Squadron, escorted by six Fairey Fulmars of 801 Squadron took off. The harbour at Kirkenes <b>was</b> <b>empty,</b> <b>and</b> one Albacore and two Fulmars were lost to AAA fire. The operation from Victorious was a disaster. 20 Albacores from 827 and 828 Squadrons, and nine Fulmars from 809 Squadrons were intercepted by four Bf 110s and nine Bf 109s from 1.(Z)./JG 77, 1./JG 77 and 14./JG 77. Only one aircraft escaped battle damage. The Germans claimed 17 destroyed for one loss (Bf 110). The FAA losses indicated 13 lost (11 Albacores and two Fulmars) and nine Albacores damaged. 827 Squadron lost six Albacore, five airmen killed and 14 captured. 828 Squadron lost five of eight Albacores, seven killed and eight captured.|$|E

500|$|The Tuscany Gian Gastone {{inherited}} was in {{a pitiful}} state: the army numbered less than 3,000, the royal coffer <b>was</b> <b>empty</b> <b>and</b> Florence was full of beggars. The ramshackle condition of the capital was noted by philosopher Montesquieu five years into Gian Gastone's reign: [...] "There is no town where men live in less luxury than Florence". Despite these hindrances, Gian Gastone, aged 52, commenced his reign with a burst of ebullience, releasing prisoners, abolishing exorbitant taxes, [...] "Pensions on the Creed" [...] (monies paid to converts to Christianity) and public executions.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the brief}} conflict, Standish offered to leave several {{soldiers}} {{to defend the}} colony, but the offer was rejected. Instead, the colonists divided: some, including John Sanders, returned to England in the Swan, while others remained behind and joined the Plymouth colony. By spring of 1623, the village <b>was</b> <b>empty</b> <b>and</b> the colony was dissolved. Thomas Weston arrived in Maine several months later, seeking to join his colony, {{only to discover that}} it was already failed. Some of his former settlers apparently had gone north to Maine, and were living on House Island in Casco Bay in a home built by explorer Capt. Christopher Levett, who had been granted land to found an English colony. (Levett's settlement also failed, and the fate of Weston's men is uncertain.) ...|$|E
500|$|Schäfer {{delegated}} {{the task}} of killing the Jewish women and children to Sattler. In turn, Sattler tasked the camp commandant, SS-Untersturmfuhrer Herbert Andorfer, to accompany the van, which would be operated by two SS-Scharführers (non-commissioned officers) sent with the van from Berlin. Except for Sundays and public holidays, the van collected groups of about 100 women and children from the camp {{on a daily basis}} and drove them to a shooting range outside Belgrade. During the trip, the exhaust would be redirected into the cargo area, killing the occupants. On arrival at the range, a four-man detachment from the German 64th Reserve Police Battalion would be waiting with a group of seven Serbian prisoners from the Belgrade prison. The prisoners would unload the van and put the corpses in a pre-dug mass grave. By 10 May 1942, the camp <b>was</b> <b>empty</b> <b>and</b> as many as 8,000 Jewish women and children had been killed by Meyszner's Gestapo. On 8 June, Schäfer declared to a group of Wehrmacht officers, including Bader and Kuntze, that there was [...] "no longer a Jewish question in Serbia".|$|E
