5|$|The {{withdrawal}} plan formulated by General Phạm Văn Phú and his General Staff was made <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces would stop and consolidate their territorial gains {{before they could}} go on the attack again. However, during the spring offensive of 1975, North Vietnamese commanders were {{more than willing to}} maneuver their units away from newly captured territories, in order to pursue retreating South Vietnamese units.|$|E
5|$|Before long, it {{was noted}} that there were {{discrepancies}} between Audisio's original story published in L'Unità, subsequent versions that he provided and the versions of events provided by others. Although his account most probably is built around the facts, it was certainly embellished. The discrepancies and obvious exaggerations, coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> that the Communist Party had selected him to claim responsibility for their own political purposes, led some in Italy to believe that his story was wholly or largely untrue.|$|E
5|$|Chryssides {{states that}} Raëlism is {{discernible}} from other UFO religions for its heavy support for physicalism and repudiation of supernaturalism. Susan J. Palmer, a social scholar {{who had long}} contacts with Raëlians, associated epiphenomenalism <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> in Raëlism that mind transfer coupled with human cloning can implant mind and personality into a new and disease free body. Raëlians publicly deny {{the existence of the}} ethereal soul and a supernatural god, but they believe that humanity for many generations past will be resurrected, albeit in a scientific way.|$|E

5|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} for Hasidic Jews to place kvitelach on the gravesite of a Rebbe or tzadik <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> that {{the soul of the}} deceased will pray for them in Heaven. The visitor usually sits beside the grave to write his kvitel and meditate on his request, and then tears the kvitel and throws it on top of the grave. Many graves of Jewish holy men are constructed with special apertures for the insertion of kvitelach.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} as to exactly why John emigrated to Serbia instead of assuming a high-ranking position in Bulgaria, as his ancestry and family ties would suggest. Bulgarian historian Ivan Bozhilov {{is of the}} opinion that John was not seeking political refuge in Serbia. Instead, it is most likely that he moved to that country <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> that Serbia's territorial expansion and political influence in that period would secure him better career opportunities. Presumably, John accompanied his sister Helena when she moved to Serbia to marry Stephen Dušan in 1332.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990, the Tower of London {{has been}} {{cared for by}} an {{independent}} charity, Historic Royal Palaces, which receives no funding from the Government or the Crown. In 1988, the Tower of London {{was added to the}} UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, in recognition of its global importance and to help conserve and protect the site. However, recent developments, such as the construction of skyscrapers nearby, have pushed the Tower towards being added to the United Nations' Heritage in Danger List. The remains of the medieval palace have been open to the public since 2006. Visitors can explore the chambers restored to their former glory, once used by past kings and queens. Although the position of Constable of the Tower remains the highest position held at the Tower, the responsibility of day-to-day administration is delegated to the Resident Governor. At least six ravens are kept at the Tower at all times, in accordance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> that if they are absent, the kingdom will fall. They are under the care of the Yeomen Warders. The earliest known reference to a Tower raven is a picture from 1883. As well as having ceremonial duties, the Yeoman Warders provide guided tours around the Tower. Just over 2.7 million people visited the Tower of London in 2016.|$|E
40|$|Prior {{studies have}} shown that cyber-ostracism {{increases}} aggression. The present research provided the first experimental support for the prediction that assuring a sense of growth after cyber-ostracism can weaken the effect of cyber-ostracism on aggression. Specifically, we found that ostracized participants who were primed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> that ostracism was detrimental behaved more aggressively than their included counterparts. In contrast, ostracized participants who were primed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>beliefs</b> that ostracism could aid their growth and development no longer behaved aggressively. These findings highlight the significance of post-ostracism cognitive processes in influencing various behavioral responses of ostracism and other interpersonal maltreatments in the cyberspace.

Likewise, shrines to Hecate at three way crossroads were created where food offerings were left at the new moon to protect those who did so from spirits and other evils.|$|E
25|$|Broadly defined, Religious Zionism is a {{movement}} that embraces the idea of Jewish national sovereignty, often in connection <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>belief</b> {{in the ability of}} the Jewish people to bring about a redemptive state through natural means, and often attributing religious significance to the modern State of Israel. (This attitude is rejected by most Haredim – but not all, particularly the Hardal movement.) Thus, in this sense, Religious Zionism in fact encompasses a wide spectrum of religious views including Modern Orthodoxy.|$|E

Ford holds that victory over the presence of sin does not occur during this lifetime, so sin continues among the saints up to the return of Jesus Christ.|$|E
