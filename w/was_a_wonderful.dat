All of the lumber she was built from was cut by hand and her boiler and engines had been brought to the building site at Four Mile packed by mule via the wagon road from Port Douglas, 300 miles away.|$|E

But it was such an amazing thing for me to come in to make this broken-down picture, and to find my director was the great Roscoe Arbuckle. Oh, I thought he was magnificent in films. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> dancer—a wonderful ballroom dancer, in his heyday. It was like floating in the arms of a huge doughnut—really delightful.|$|E

25|$|Crash {{landing in}} no man's land, Stahlschmidt escaped the burning wreck {{with just a}} pair of singed eyebrows. Once again, as he ran on foot toward German lines, Stahlschmidt was fired on by an Allied truck convoy which he had just overflown. However he {{was picked up by}} a German {{reconnaissance}} unit. Back at Staffel HQ Stahlschmidt learned from Marseille and Homuth that the lead Kittyhawk had pulled up sharply and fired accurately. Both were of the opinion that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> shot. The Allied pilot was the leading Australian ace, Squadron Leader Clive Caldwell, CO of No. 112 Squadron RAF.|$|E
25|$|Allen {{wrote the}} novel Just Tell Me What You Want! in 1969, {{with the idea}} of turning it into a screenplay. After having trouble getting {{together}} a production, Allen sent it to Sidney Lumet, who surprisingly wanted to do it. In her opinion, Lumet <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> structuralist but has his most difficult time with humorous dialogue; he hadn't found a way to shoot humorous dialogue as brilliantly as he shot everything else. Some of the humor was lost in Just Tell Me What You Want when Sidney gave the voice-over to Ali MacGraw instead of Myrna Loy as was originally intended. But the collaboration worked wonderfully; unbeknownst to each other they both had wanted to cast Alan King. This synchronicity in casting preference continued with all three Lumet/Allen movies.|$|E
500|$|I deplore {{the fact}} that East Germans were shot while trying to flee westward, but the Berlin Wall served a useful purpose.

Today there's hardly a place that isn't in flames. Were you ever in East Germany? It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> country! ...|$|E

The suit claimed infringement on Knievel's trademarked name and likeness. Knievel also claimed that the [...] "vulgar and offensive" [...] images depicted in the video damaged his reputation. The suit sought monetary damages and an injunction to stop distribution of the video. West's attorneys argued that the music video amounted to satire and therefore was covered under the First Amendment. Just days {{before his death in}} November 2007, Knievel amicably settled the suit after being paid a visit from West, saying, [...] "I thought he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> guy and quite a gentleman." ...|$|E
500|$|David Starkey {{was born}} on 3 January 1945 in Kendal, Westmorland. [...] He is {{the only child of}} Robert Starkey and Elsie Lyon, Quakers who had married 10 years {{previously}} in Bolton, at a Friends meeting house. His father, the son of a cotton spinner, was a foreman in a washing-machine factory, while his mother followed in her father's footsteps and became a cotton weaver and later a cleaner. Starkey is equivocal about his mother, describing her as both [...] "wonderful", in that she helped develop his ambition, and [...] "monstrous", intellectually frustrated and living through her son. [...] "She <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> but also very frightening parent. Finally, she was a Pygmalion. [...] She wanted a creature, she wanted something she had made." [...] Her dominance contrasted sharply to his father, who was [...] "poetic, reflective, rather solitary...as a father he was weak." [...] Their relationship was [...] "distant", but improved after his mother's death in 1977.|$|E
500|$|However, Behan {{found he}} could not {{concentrate}} on his art in Germany as he was working too hard in the evenings in nightclubs and bars to earn money. Also, as he was doing [...] "too much drinking as well, so unless I {{wanted to start a}} new art style where it would've been very 'shakey' [...] to look at, basically I decided I had to do something else". He resolved to go to London to study acting. After applying to three drama schools he was accepted by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). For about three years from 1990 or 1991, he lived with his friends from RADA, David Harewood and Danny Cerqueira, at 39 Ravenshaw Street in West Hampstead. Harewood recalls that his housemates were [...] "fantastic characters" [...] – [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful,</b> experimental time. We'd spend long nights discussing art, life and politics; smoking weed, drinking lots of whisky, listening to music and throwing furniture on the fire." ...|$|E

They were not religious, and by his youth, Feynman described himself as an [...] "avowed atheist". Many years later, {{in a letter to}} Tina Levitan, declining a request for information for her book on Jewish Nobel Prize winners, he stated, [...] "To select, for approbation the peculiar elements that come from some supposedly Jewish heredity is to open the door to all kinds of nonsense on racial theory", adding, [...] "at thirteen I was not only converted to other religious views, but I also stopped believing that the Jewish people are in any way 'the chosen people'. (He {{was not included in the}} book.)"

Imrie played various roles throughout the run, like a co-presenter of McConomy (a spoof TV economy show), and most famously Miss Babs in Acorn Antiques. Imrie said in 2007, [...] "Miss Babs is still what I'm best known for, even though I don't go around with bright yellow hair."

[...] Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer to leave you with something to talk about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in the room, we talked about what it meant ... The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons—who had been one person—to become two whole people, come back together, agree to go on a date, and then have this happen, felt beautifully poetic".|$|E
