[...] Similarly, he was one of nine Republican senators who voted for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 at the end of the year. [...] By early 2014, McCain's apostasies were enough that the Arizona Republican Party formally censured him for having what they saw as a liberal record that had been [...] "disastrous and harmful". [...] McCain remained stridently opposed to many aspects of Obama's foreign policy, however, and in June 2014, following major gains by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, decried what he saw as a U.S. failure to protect its past gains in Iraq and called on the president's entire national security team to resign. [...] McCain said, [...] "Could all this have been avoided? ... The answer is absolutely yes. If I sound angry it's because I am angry." ...|$|E
