40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims {{to analyze}} and reproduce the concept of comprehension (Verstehen) in the work Truth and Method by Hans-Georg Gadamer. For him, the comprehension is an attribute of the human experience of the world. This thesis is developed starting at two assumptions: (i) the concept of Husserl´s Lebenswelt, which is the condition of possibility of knowledge: before knowing subject is already object in the world; (ii) the decisive contribution of Heidegger the defenition of phenomenology as hermeneutics by resuming {{the sense of being}} in Dasein, which is known under the name of “hermeneutics of facticity”. Accordingly, first is the way to be the work of art as a parameter so that we can investigate the phenomenon of understanding. The concept of play as well as the experience of the work of art has an end in itself shows that the spectator (the player) engages in the configuration of the spectacle (the play). In a second moment, is to examine the principle of the historicity of comprehension, which includes the substantiality of the historicity of the interpreter and awareness of the value of tradition in the act of understanding texts. Wherefore the rehabilitation of prejudice as a condition of possibility of the interpreter becomes key here. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> hermeneutic experience refers to the experience of human finitude where an experience is never repeated, but is constantly learning. Finally, it is the character of language as a means of understanding privileged hermeneutical experience. More specifically it is in language as dialogue that shows the speculative character, in which the meaning of the thing in question shows what it really is. In the language is that comprehension finds its objectivity, and therefore, gives understanding the character of universality. So, the finitude, the historicity of human and how to be language are prerequisites of comprehension, which acts in the becoming of understanding and gives the character of legitimacy even if not demonstrable. Esta dissertação tem o objetivo de recriar o conceito de compreensão (Verstehen) na obra Verdade e Método de Hans-Georg Gadamer. Para ele, a compreensão consiste num atributo da experiência de mundo do ser humano. A tese é desenvolvida a partir de dois pressupostos: (i) o conceito de Lebenswelt de Husserl, o qual é condição de possibilidade de conhecimento: antes de ser sujeito cognoscente já se é objeto no mundo; (ii) a contribuição de Heidegger, na definição de fenomenologia como hermenêutica através da retomada do sentido do ser no Dasein, que é conhecida sob o nome de “hermenêutica da facticidade”. Primeiramente, tratase do modo de ser da obra de arte como parâmetro a fim de se investigar o fenômeno da compreensão. Assim como a experiência da obra de arte, o conceito de jogo possui um fim em si mesmo, que se configura enquanto o espectador (o jogador) envolve-se no espetáculo (no jogo). Posteriormente, trata-se de pensar o princípio da historicidade da compreensão, o qual inclui a substancialidade da historicidade do intérprete e a consciência do valor da tradição no ato de compreender textos. Aqui, a reabilitação do preconceito como condição de possibilidade do intérprete torna-se chave. Quando se diz da experiência hermenêutica querse referir à experiência da finitude humana que nunca é repetida, e está em constante processo de aprendizado. Por fim, trata-se do caráter da linguagem da compreensão como meio privilegiado da experiência hermenêutica. Especificamente, é na linguagem - como diálogo - que se mostra o caráter especulativo, no qual o sentido da coisa em questão mostra-se tal e qual ela é. Nela é que a compreensão encontra sua objetividade e, por isso, dá à compreensão o caráter de universalidade. Portanto, a finitude, a historicidade humana e o modo de ser linguagem são pressupostos da compreensão, os quais atuam no acontecer da compreensão e lhe dão o caráter de legitimidade ainda que não sejam demonstráveis...|$|E
