40|$|AbstractA 3 -stage {{stamping}} process including thickening of bottom and flange corners {{of a cup}} with a flange was developed to improve the fatigue strength of a mild steel cup. A circular blank is drawn with conical punches in the 1 st and 2 nd stages, and the bottom and flange corners were thickened by flattening the conical bottom of the cup with a flange in the 3 rd stage. The amounts of thickening at both corners were improved by contact of the inclined portion between the two corners with the inner punch in the 3 rd stage, thus the thickening was concentrated around the two corners by preventing the thickening of the inclined portion. A <b>wheel</b> <b>disk</b> formed by 6 -stage stamping having the following three stages has 15 % and 10 % thickening {{at the bottom and}} flange corners, respectively, and the bending rigidity was 1. 7 times as large as that without thickening.

40|$|Rub-impact {{fault model}} for dual-rotor system was further developed, in which rubbing board is {{regarded}} as elastic sheet. Sheet elastic deformation, contact penetration, and elastic damping support during rubbing of sheet and <b>wheel</b> <b>disk</b> were considered. Collision force and friction were calculated by utilizing Hertz contact theory and Coulomb model and introducing nonlinear spring damping model and friction coefficient. Then kinetic differential equations of rub-impact under dry rubbing condition were established. Based on one-dimensional finite element model of dual-rotor system, dynamic transient response of overall structure under rub-impact existing between rotor wheel and sheet was obtained. Meanwhile, fault dynamic characteristics and impact of rubbing clearance on rotor vibration were analyzed. The results show that, {{during the process of}} rub-impact, the spectrums of rotor vibration are complicated and multiple combined frequency components of inner and outer rotor fundamental frequencies are typical characteristic of rub-impact fault for dual-rotor system. It also can be seen from rotor vibration response that the rubbing rotor’s fundamental frequency is modulated by normal rotor double frequency...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The paper aims at {{estimation}} of resource of strength increase for railway <b>wheel</b> <b>disk.</b> Methodology. The material for research was carbon steel of railway wheel containing 0. 57 %C, 0. 65 %Si, 0. 45 %Mn, 0. 0029 %S, 0, 014 %P, 0, 11 %Cr. A railway wheel was heated to the temperatures above and {{was held at}} this temperature until the completion of аustenite homogenization processes and then the disk was cooled at a growing rate to a certain temperature. A temperature interval of completion of the speed-up <b>wheel</b> <b>disk</b> cooling was 200 - 450 C. Structure was studied {{with the use of}} research methods under electronic and light microscopes. After accelerated cooling the {{estimation of}} metal structure imperfection degree was carried out with the use of X-ray structural analysis method. The stress and yielding limit of carbon steel were determined at tension, at a speed of deformation. The microhardness of steel structural components was estimated using the microhardness tester of PMT- 3 type. Findings. The properties complex of railway wheel carbon steel depending on the temperature of the accelerated cooling termination is determined by the correlation of soften and work-hardening processes development. The effect of work-hardening is based on blocking of mobile dislocations due to a precipitation carbon atoms and dispersion work-hardening from the formed particles of carbidic phase. At the temperatures of the accelerated cooling termination of carbon steel higher than 300 - 350 C the decrease rate of strength properties is determined by the exceeding of total soften effect from disintegration of solid solution, acceleration of spheroidithation and coalescence of cementite particles above the dislocations blocking by the carbon atoms and dispersion work-hardening. Originality. Authors proved that the strength level of the railway wheel carbon steel from the temperature of accelerated cooling completion is determined by the influence ratio of the solid solution satiety degree and dispersion work-hardening from a carbidic phase. For the temperatures of accelerated cooling termination 200 - 300 C a decrease of solid solution satiety degree is a basic factor, which determines the level of the strength characteristic. Practical value. When making the whole-rolled railway wheel one can increase the strength limit of disk metal using the accelerated cooling to the middle interval of temperatures, which was successfully proven by authors...|$|E
40|$|A plate forging of a drawn {{cup with}} a flange {{including}} thickening of corners {{was developed to}} improve the stiffness of the cup. In a 3 -stage stamping process, the bottom and flange corners of the cup with a flange were thickened by the plate forging. A circular blank was drawn with conical punches in the 1 st and 2 nd stages. In the 3 rd stage, the bottom and flange corners were thickened by flattening the conical bottom of the cup with a flange. Both the bottom and flange corners of the cup were thickened by compressing the flange corner {{in the latter half}} of the 3 rd stage. The amounts of thickening at both corners were improved by modification of intermediate shape. The thickening was concentrated around the two corners by preventing the thickening of the inclined portion.

Special requirements for new installations of stationary systems (AURA) and underfloor testing stations (UFPE) called {{for the development of}} state-of-the-art miniaturized front-end ultrasonic and eddy-current test instrumentation. This innovation offers new dimensions for the concept and design of such systems, including features providing effortless maintenance of the inspection systems. Due to the small size of the electronic modules they can be placed in close proximity to the transducer assembly. High-speed networking techniques ensure the transfer of all the acquired digital ultrasonic and eddy-current data from the frontend modules to the workstation responsible for data acquisition and analysis. The new front-end technology is applied for the testing stations of the latest generation. One example is a system installed at the DB plant Krefeld, specifically designed for the ultrasonic testing of ICE train drive wheels.

40|$|High {{strength}} steels {{are becoming}} more and more interesting for the automotive industry as they allow car weight reduction due to lower thickness ensuring the same performance and improved safety by higher en-ergy absorption. A known way of improving the strength, ductility and formability of steels is to make use of additional strengthening and deformation mechanisms by introducing supplementary phases. It is evident that the fatigue behaviour of the materials used for automotive applications is a major point to be taken into account in design and material selection. In this paper the fatigue behaviour of different newly developed high strength multiphase steels (TS> 600 MPa) including ferritic-bainitic, ferritic-martensitic and TRIP steels is compared with the fatigue behaviour of the commercially available microalloyed steels used at the mo-ment by the automotive producers.
