60|$|Mr. Canning did {{not come}} to {{business}} until very late, as he lived twenty-five miles out of the city, in New Jersey. There were no clerks but Gus and myself; so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the office I found Mr. Stillwell still alone.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Fraunheim, I {{found my}} alert American punctually there before me. He raised his crush hat with awkward politeness. I {{could see he}} was little {{accustomed}} to ladies' society. Then he pointed to a close cab in which he had reached the village.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Ringgold, however, on the 27th, I {{saw that}} the retreat was most earnest. The enemy had been {{throwing}} away guns, caissons and small-arms, abandoning provisions, and, altogether, seemed to be moving like a disorganized mob, {{with the exception of}} Cleburne's division, which was acting as rear-guard to cover the retreat.|$|E

[...] "I shall speak to every one I meet this afternoon--I shall be, in fact, most sociable--and sooner or later in our {{conversation}} I shall ask every one if they know Mr. Grex and his daughter. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> some one who does, that will be the first step, won't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] she answered. [...] "For myself, I {{think that}} I always {{feel a little}} nervous <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> a strange place. I have never been here before, you know, and I could not help wondering, for a moment, what would become of me if my uncle were really taken ill. Everyone says that London is so big and cold and heartless." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the Crescent City I hurried away--far {{away from}} the St. Charles to a dim chambre garnie in Bienville Street. And there, looking down from my attic window {{from time to time}} at the old, yellow, absinthe house across the street, I wrote this story to buy my bread and butter.|$|E

[...] "I {{never saw}} him since; but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the Rue St. Germain l'Auxerrois I {{was told by the}} good people who took charge of me that the ragged man-of-all-work had been none other than the mysterious Englishman whom Armand reveres, he whom they call the Scarlet Pimpernel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{remember}} that I {{refused to discuss}} things with you then. I told you that I was coming for you the next morning, and I mentioned what I thought of bringing with me. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> your boarding-house you had gone. You left no word nor any message. I don't consider that that was treating me nicely." ...|$|E

But I always grapple with how much I should stick with the plan and how much to riff, be serendipitous and follow the natural path that unwinds through every place. Gary Lee ...|$|R

6000|$|... "So much, my dear," [...] {{proceeded}} Sir Patrick, [...] "for those necessary explanations {{which are}} also the necessary nuisances of human intercourse. You now {{know as much as}} I did <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Craig Fernie--and you are, therefore, in a position to appreciate the value of my discoveries at the inn. Do you understand every thing, so far?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the depot, I found, {{much to my}} disgust, a {{bunch of}} at least twenty tramps that were waiting to ride out the blind baggages of the overland. Now two or three tramps on the blind baggage are all right. They are inconspicuous. But a score! That meant trouble. No train-crew would ever let all of us ride.|$|E

6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> Constantinople, <b>I</b> shall {{determine}} whether to proceed [...] into Persia or return, which latter I do not wish, if I can avoid it.

I have written to him repeatedly, {{that he may not}} plead [...] ignorance of my situation for neglect. I can give you no account of [...] any thing, for I have not time or opportunity, the frigate sailing [...] immediately. Indeed the further I go the more my laziness increases, [...] and my aversion to letter-writing becomes more confirmed. I have [...] written to no one but to yourself and Mr. Hanson, and these are [...] communications of business and duty rather than of inclination.|$|R
6000|$|... "It has {{not been}} dreadful," [...] Walter replied with a smile, [...] "though I own {{that it was not}} {{pleasant}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the great mansion; but the lady put me quite at my ease, and she talked to me for some time, and finally she bestowed on me this chain, which our lady, the queen, had herself given her." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> {{the docks}} {{on my way}} to the ship, I entered the guard-house within the walls, and asked for one of the captains, to whom I told the story; but, from what he said, was led to infer that the Dock Police was {{distinct}} from that of the town, and this was not the right place to lodge my information.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{were always}} alike," [...] she confided,--"the same figures, same shaped head {{and that sort}} of thing. Douglas was a little overfond of life, though, and Philip here hasn't found out yet what it means. It was a shock, though, Miss Dalstan. Philip was sitting in the dark <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> his rooms this evening, and--I thought it was Douglas." ...|$|E
6000|$|But the south-easter was not blowing <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> {{the ancient}} capital of South Africa.

60|$|Before {{the receipt}} by me of these orders {{the battle of}} Chickamauga had been fought and Rosecrans forced back into Chattanooga. The {{administration}} {{as well as the}} General-in-chief was nearly frantic at the situation of affairs there. Mr. Charles A. Dana, an officer of the War Department, was sent to Rosecrans' headquarters. I do not know what his instructions were, but he was still in Chattanooga <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> there <b>at</b> a later period.|$|R

Misconceptions about Conceptual Change It is important to understand that those who are involved in the conceptual change research domain are concerned about much more than simply altering a particular belief.

Let’s say that I am walking across campus and I notice that clouds are moving overhead. It is not raining as I enter Wood Hall to go to my office. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> my office, Ozcan is there.

It is completely dry! ” Unbeknownst to me, however, storm clouds have begun to move over the campus even as I am speaking...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It matters little,' {{said the}} old man, 'where, or how, I picked up this brief history. If I were to relate it in {{the order in which}} it reached me, I should {{commence}} in the middle, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the conclusion, go back for a beginning. It is enough for me to say that some of its circumstances passed before my own eyes; for the remainder I know them to have happened, and there are some persons yet living, who will remember them but too well.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was eleven}} o'clock <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the house. A slatternly, sulky woman {{opened the door}} to me. [...] "Oh!

There! there's the other doctor coming down stairs; he'll show you the room--I won't go near it." ...|$|E
60|$|It was midnight <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> home. I {{had reached}} my own gate, and was {{standing}} {{listening for the}} deep bell of St. Paul's, the sound of which I thought had been borne towards me among the multitude of striking clocks, when I was rather {{surprised to see that}} the door of my aunt's cottage was open, and that a faint light in the entry was shining out across the road.|$|E
6000|$|I had telephoned Nancy, {{making an}} {{appointment}} for the afternoon. Sometimes--not too frequently--we were {{in the habit of}} going out into the country in one of her motors, a sort of landaulet, I believe, in which we were separated from the chauffeur by a glass screen. She was waiting for me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived,</b> <b>at</b> four; and as soon as we had shot clear of the city, [...] "Maude is going away," [...] I told her.|$|E
50|$|Following al-Fadl I's defeat, {{the entire}} region became chaotic, with the Byzantine Empire {{pressuring}} Armenian princes and the Seljuq Turks gaining influence over Azerbaijan after a Seljuq attack on Dvin. The poet Qatran Tabrizi praised Ali II Lashkari for his victory over Armenian and Georgian princes during his stay in Ganja. Abu'l-Aswar Shavur I ibn al-Fadl I took power in 1049 with Ganja as his capital. He was the last independent ruling Shaddadid until 1067, <b>when</b> Tugrul <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Ganja and demanded his vassalage. With this, the Seljuqs imposed direct rule over Arran and ended Shaddadid influence there.|$|R
60|$|The evening set in misty and obscure; and it {{was dark}} almost <b>when</b> J----- and <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> the landing stage on our return.

But on this occasion, though, Val just thinks, 'he's not getting my pub'. Consciously, she's worried about Diane but subconsciously, she's only ever totally concerned about herself. I've said this before, but I wrote a list of quintessential characteristics of Val on a post-it note <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>arrived</b> <b>at</b> Emmerdale and <b>I</b> keep them in my script file.
