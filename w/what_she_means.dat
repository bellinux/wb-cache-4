5|$|At Giles' {{apartment}} Xander and Anya argue, as Anya {{is trying}} to get Xander to tell her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means</b> to him. He is unable to answer her. Willow attends a meeting of the campus Wicca group, hoping to meet others who share her interest in studying witchcraft, but is disappointed when they only talk about bake sales. Willow raises the subject of spells but is chastised for pandering to the stereotype about witches performing magic. A shy woman in the group, Tara Maclay, starts to speak up to support Willow's suggestion, but falls silent when the attention turns to her.|$|E
25|$|There is {{debate in}} regards to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means</b> when she uses the term lesser light, to explain her {{relationship}} to the Bible.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe called [...] "Get Back" [...] a [...] "welcome girl-rock hit". Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included the song at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and said, [...] "She wrote {{this with the}} Jonas Brothers, but it sounds more like a Tommy Tutone B-side from the early '80s or {{the sort of thing}} Greg Kihn was pining for when he sang, 'They don't write 'em like that anymore'". Masley noted that the song sounds better live, as does [...] "nearly everything Lovato touches". Masley concluded, writing, [...] "When she sings 'I {{want to get back to}} the old days,' <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means</b> is when she and her boyfriend were happy, but power-pop fans will hear it as a call to get back to much older days than that." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget. Joey Guerra of The Houston Chronicle called it [...] "undeniably kicky, and Lovato manages some surprisingly credible rock wails." [...] Ken Barnes of USA Today called it an [...] "insidious, Go-Go's-like single".|$|E
6000|$|<b>What</b> did <b>she</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>What</b> did <b>she</b> <b>mean?</b> [...] 180 [...] For {{with a smile}} she cried: [...] 'Unblest ye {{shall not}} pass my door, [...] The bride-groom and his bride.|$|R
60|$|Arthur {{watched her}} face for some {{explanation}} of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> did <b>mean.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{knelt down}} beside her. <b>What</b> did <b>she</b> <b>mean?</b> But he knew well enough.|$|R
2500|$|Other, more pro-Serb British intellectuals sharply criticised her views. Rebecca West {{included}} Durham in her {{description of}} the sort of traveller who came back [...] "with a pet Balkan people established in their hearts as suffering and innocent, eternally the massacree and never the massacrer," [...] (Durham sued West over this) and then went on to say [...] "the Albanians, as championed by Miss Durham, strongly resembled Sir Joshua Reynold's picture of the Infant Samuel." [...] The distinguished historian R.W. Seton-Watson commented that [...] "the fact is that while always denouncing 'Balkan mentality', she is herself exactly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means</b> by the word." ...|$|E
2500|$|The narrator {{warns that}} Amy's sweet face masks [...] "stubbornness and tenacity."(188) When {{she wants to}} discuss [...] "happiness," [...] Cope imagines <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means</b> and is [...] "conscious of a {{fundamental}} repugnance to any such scheme of life and was acutely aware that–for a while at least, and perhaps for always–he {{wanted to live in}} quite a different mode."(189) [...] Joe tells Randolph that Cope is always at Mrs. Phillips' and Amy has given the house [...] "the deadly aroma of a courtship going stale."(191) It is clear to Joe that Randolph's move to new quarters was motivated by the possibility of entertaining Cope. As they discuss the possibility of Cope marrying, Randolph remarks:(193) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's not frills. I quite {{understand}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means.</b> It wouldn't {{have been very}} nice for the Davidsons to have to mix with all that rough lot in the smoking-room." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{really did}} not {{understand}} her, but my Mother Midnight began very seriously to explain <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>mean,</b> {{as soon as she}} was gone. 'Madam,' says she, 'you seem not to understand what your landlady means; and when you do understand it, you need not let her know at all that you do so.|$|R
6000|$|... "Think not, Major, my ma {{always say}} <b>she</b> forget him. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>she</b> not like talk about him, he such a swell. Why Jeekie so strong, so clever {{and with such}} {{beautiful}} face? No doubt because he is son of very great man. All this true reason why he {{want to go with}} you, Major. Still, p'raps poor old Jeekie make mistake, p'raps he dream 'cause he eat too much supper, p'raps his ma dead, after all. If so, p'raps better stay at home--not know." ...|$|R
60|$|Austin {{started a}} little. He {{did not see}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> could <b>mean,</b> and the speech {{appeared}} a trifle inhuman.|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s a secret," [...] {{explained}} Mr. Tredgold, addressing his staring friend. [...] "And {{you must}} swear {{to keep it}} if it’s told you. That’s <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means.</b> I’ve had to and so has Stobell." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Alda {{seemed as}} little {{disposed}} as Mrs. Underwood {{to quit the}} scene of conflict. 'O Felix, I don't know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means,</b> nor {{what we have been}} doing, for them all to turn against me.' ...|$|E
60|$|Asca. You must resolve, for {{the time}} presses. She told me, this hour, she had sent for your father: <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means</b> I know not, for she seemed doubtful, and would not tell me her intention.|$|E
60|$|Lys. In short, {{the queen}} hath sent to part you two:-- <b>What</b> more <b>she</b> <b>means</b> to her, I know not.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your great-grandmother's brother! She's {{traced the}} whole connection--more than your Aunt Sydney could do. <b>What</b> does <b>she</b> <b>mean</b> about our keeping quiet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>What</b> does <b>she</b> <b>mean</b> by {{this look}} and this imploring gesture? Why does she come so close? What is {{the letter that}} she holds? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would hardly}} be {{premature}} for my partner to announce <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means</b> to make trumps," [...] interrupted Lady Caroline, in a voice of such sinister gentleness that St. Michael fled headlong {{back to his own}} table.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis but {{a little}} faded flower.' Where's my Horace? Look here, I don't {{understand}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means</b> by stinkin' out Rattray's dormitory first. We holed in under White's, didn't we?" [...] asked McTurk, with a wrinkled brow.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, I'm sure; but {{she said}} I {{had no right to}} marry without the consent of my {{surviving}} relatives, and {{that she was going to}} look into it. I can't think <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means</b> by that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be comforted," [...] I replied, {{wondering}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> might <b>mean</b> by this loosing of the Powers. [...] "I {{think that}} she loves him too well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, <b>what</b> does <b>she</b> <b>mean</b> by that?' he thought. The {{word was}} to him extravagant and dangerous--it {{was as if she}} had said: [...] "How jolly!" ...|$|R
60|$|Ratia nodded, looked {{excessively}} arch, {{and formed}} a word with her lips, which Phoebe thought was 'jealous,' but could not imagine <b>what</b> <b>she</b> could <b>mean</b> by it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!--well--to be sure. Yes, I see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means,</b> (turning to Mr. Knightley,) and I {{will try}} to hold my tongue. I must make myself very disagreeable, or {{she would not have}} said such a thing to an old friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{was very}} grotesque!" [...] said the Angel. [...] "Very. Much {{more than the}} little man in black. And she means it.---- But <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means</b> I don't know!..." [...] He became silent. [...] "I suppose they all mean something,", he said, presently, still perplexed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I wonder <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means</b> to do," [...] meditated Eustace, as {{the butler}} brought him his hat. [...] "I really should not {{wonder if she}} came round to it. But then, one never knows how a woman will take a thing. If she will, she will, etc., etc." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{followed}} her blindly to the bedside, little guessing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> could <b>mean.</b> <b>She</b> knelt {{down at the}} head of the cot. The girl's eyes were closed. I touched her cheek; she was in a high fever. [...] "Temperature?" [...] I asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't mean Mis' Durgin. I shouldn't care <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{thought of}} my talkin' him over with you. I don't know," [...] he continued, putting up his hand against the door-frame, to give himself the comfort of its support while he talked, [...] "as you {{understood}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>mean</b> by the young ladies at Boston keepin' up with the fellows in college. Well, that's what Cynthy's doin' with Jeff, right along; and if he ever works off them conditions of his, and gits his degree, it' ll be because she helped him to. I tell you, there's more than one kind of telepathy in this world, Mr. Westover. That's all." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> did <b>she</b> <b>mean?</b> Was <b>she</b> {{clinging}} {{desperately to}} {{the hope of}} melting Michael Vanstone's heart? Mr. Clare could draw no other conclusion from <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had just said to him. At {{the beginning of the}} interview he would have roughly dispelled her delusion. At the end of the interview he left her compassionately in possession of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Caprice," [...] Millicent smiled. [...] "Some of {{them are}} savage, and they cost a good deal. I can't imagine <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means</b> to do with them; I don't think she knows herself. One of them, however, has been {{growling}} all day, and as it's apparently unwell it mustn't be neglected." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do as I tell you! My head {{is quiet}} while I lie down. Even {{a woman in}} my {{condition}} can say <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means</b> to do. I shall not close my eyes tonight, unless I can feel that I have put that wretch in her right place. Who are your lawyers?" ...|$|E
60|$|I can't imagine <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>means,</b> {{but there}} is the note, and it shall be opened as she directs. My head is aching, and I have written enough for to-night. To-morrow I dare say that what seems so inexplicable will take quite another complexion. I shall not {{surrender}} my convictions without a struggle.|$|E
60|$|Weston was startled, but she {{saw that}} he would not allow himself to wonder <b>what</b> <b>she</b> really did <b>mean.</b>|$|R
6000|$|But old Jolyon freed {{himself from}} her caress, his face wore the {{judicial}} look which came upon {{it when he}} dealt with affairs. He asked: <b>What</b> did <b>she</b> <b>mean?</b> There was something behind all this--had she been seeing Bosinney? ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her curiously--not {{altogether}} unimpressed. Treachery! <b>What</b> did <b>she</b> <b>mean</b> by that? <b>She</b> moved a step nearer to him. Underneath her loose gown her bosom rose and fell quickly. Her face was flushed and her eyes brilliant.|$|R
