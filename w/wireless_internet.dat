5|$|The city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, {{is covered}} by a citywide {{broadband}} <b>wireless</b> <b>internet</b> network, sometimes called Wireless Minneapolis. The network was first proposed in 2003, at which point only a few other cities nationwide had such systems in place. Local firm US Internet beat out EarthLink to build and operate the network, with a guaranteed ten-year, multimillion-dollar contract from the city itself as the network's anchor tenant. Construction began on the project in 2006, but encountered several delays. Most {{of the city was}} covered by the network by 2010, and USI Wireless, the subsidiary of US Internet responsible for the system, set up numerous free internet access points at public locations around Minneapolis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The 3 rd Generation (3 G) <b>wireless</b> mobile <b>internet</b> {{networks}} {{are ready to}} live up to its performance in computer networking and mobile devices, which have limitation on access voice quality and only up to 2 M bit/sec for data rates. The 4 th Generation (4 G) <b>wireless</b> mobile <b>internet</b> networks combine current existing 3 G cellular networks (i. e., IPv 6, OFDM, CDMA 2000, WCDMA and TD_SCDMA) and Wi-Fi (i. e., Wireless LAN) networks with fixed <b>internet</b> to support <b>wireless</b> mobile <b>internet</b> as the same quality of service as fixed internet, which is an evolution not only to move beyond the limitations and problems of 3 G, but also to enhance the quality of services, to increase the bandwidth and to reduce the cost of the resource. IPv 6 is a basic protocol for running on both 4 G and 5 G, which works on single bandwidth of 4 G. The 5 th <b>wireless</b> mobile <b>internet</b> network is a completed wireless communication with almost no limitation. In this paper, we propose Mix-Bandwidth data path for 5 G real wireless world...|$|R

5|$|The city {{opened up}} bidding for the {{construction}} of the network in 2005, eventually receiving bids from eight different internet service providers. Of these eight, Atlanta-based EarthLink and Minnetonka-based US Internet were selected as semifinalists, and each company set up a trial program in Minneapolis before the final decision was made. During this process, outcry arose from both members of the Institute for Local Self Reliance about the lack of public hearings {{on the subject of the}} network, and from Qwest, another internet service provider who had placed a bid to build and run the network, about the city's plan to be involved in the <b>wireless</b> <b>internet</b> business at all. The deputy chief information officer of Minneapolis, Bill Beck, stated that the city was worried about legal restrictions and lawsuits, which were key reasons for the lack of transparency in the process.|$|E

5|$|The Nintendo DSi {{connects to}} the Internet via either its {{built-in}} 802.11b/g Wi-Fi or a Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector; both methods grant access to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. The DSi supports WEP, WPA (AES/TKIP), and WPA2 (AES/TKIP) wireless encryption; only software with built-in support can use the latter two encryption types, as they were {{not supported by the}} DS and DS Lite. Up to six <b>wireless</b> <b>Internet</b> connection profiles can be saved; using the traditional setup method, the first three profiles support WEP encryption, while the remaining three are selectable under a more advanced option, which supports WPA encryption. Under this advanced option, users may access the Wi-Fi Protected Setup method and configure proxy settings. The DSi can automatically detect Nintendo Zone service areas thus preventing the need to manually setup Wi-Fi connections. The service offers demos of upcoming and currently available games, access to the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and DSi Shop, and may have location-specific content.|$|E
