5|$|Alternate reality {{games were}} used to promote {{the release of the}} games in the main trilogy. The Cortana Letters, a series of cryptic email messages, were {{circulated}} by Bungie prior to Halo: Combat Evolveds release. I Love Bees was used to promote the release of Halo2. The game revolved around a website created by 42 Entertainment, commissioned by Microsoft and endorsed by Bungie. Over the course of the game, audio clips were released that eventually formed a complete five-hour story set on Earth between Halo and Halo2. Similarly, Iris was used as a viral marketing campaign for the release of Halo3. It featured five <b>web</b> <b>servers</b> containing various media files related to the Halo universe.|$|E

40|$|Several {{researchers}} have reported {{the fact that}} <b>web</b> <b>server</b> systems executing continuously {{for a long time}} show a degradation of their performance, and/or an in- creased occurrence rate of hang/crash failures. This phe- nomenon has been called ’web server aging’. To avoid this problem, it becomes an important issue to detect <b>web</b> <b>server</b> aging in <b>web</b> <b>server</b> maintenance. Existing technologies depending on aging samples succeed in detecting known <b>web</b> <b>server</b> aging, but fail to detect novel aging because of the nondeterministic nature of the <b>web</b> <b>server</b> aging. Given that normal samples are much easier to acquire from running <b>web</b> <b>server</b> than aging samples, this paper proposed an immune-inspired real-valued negative selection algorithm to detect previously unseen <b>web</b> <b>server</b> aging, it only needs normal samples to train detectors that have the ability to classify a novel sample as <b>web</b> <b>server</b> aging or not. The basis of the detection is aging causes performance deviation from the normal state. Preliminary experimental results showed that the method could improve the performance of the detection of novel <b>web</b> <b>server</b> aging without responding to normal status...|$|R
5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} {{returned to}} prominence in late 2013 with {{the propagation of}} CryptoLocker—using the Bitcoin digital currency platform to collect ransom money. In December 2013, ZDNet estimated based on Bitcoin transaction information that between 15 October and 18 December, the operators of CryptoLocker had procured about US$27 million from infected users. The CryptoLocker technique was widely copied in the months following, including CryptoLocker 2.0 (though not {{to be related to}} CryptoLocker), CryptoDefense (which initially contained a major design flaw that stored the private key on the infected system in a user-retrievable location, due to its use of Windows' built-in encryption APIs), and the August 2014 discovery of a Trojan specifically targeting network-attached storage devices produced by Synology. In January 2015, it was reported that ransomware-styled attacks have occurred against individual websites via hacking, and through ransomware designed to target Linux-based <b>web</b> <b>servers.</b>|$|E
5|$|PHP is a {{general-purpose}} {{scripting language}} that is especially suited to server-side web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a web server. Any PHP code in a requested file is executed by the PHP runtime, usually to create dynamic web page content or dynamic images used on websites or elsewhere. It {{can also be used}} for command-line scripting and client-side graphical user interface (GUI) applications. PHP can be deployed on most <b>web</b> <b>servers,</b> many operating systems and platforms, and can be used with many relational database management systems (RDBMS). Most web hosting providers support PHP for use by their clients. It is available free of charge, and the PHP Group provides the complete source code for users to build, customize and extend for their own use.|$|E
