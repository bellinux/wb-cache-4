5|$|Why {{they went}} to land {{in the first place}} is still debated. One reason could be that the small juveniles who had {{completed}} their metamorphosis had <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> to make use of what land had to offer. Already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (just as modern fish and amphibians often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests), two very different niches partially overlapped each other, with the young juveniles in the diffuse line between. One of them was overcrowded and dangerous while the other was much safer and much less crowded, offering less competition over resources. The terrestrial niche was also a much more challenging place for primary aquatic animals, but because of the way evolution and selection pressure work, those juveniles who could take advantage of this would be rewarded. Once they gained a small foothold on land, thanks to their preadaptations and being at {{the right place at the}} right time, favourable variations in their descendants would gradually result in continuing evolution and diversification.|$|E

25|$|Once {{a devoted}} and bright faerie, she {{questioned}} the King {{as to why}} a faerie like herself was not permitted to visit him as often and freely as Oran. The King responds by saying that she and Oran are different by birth, and faery as lowly as Seraphina can not possibly compare herself with Oran. This left Seraphina jealous and determine to best Oran, no matter <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>took,</b> and constantly strove towards what ever goal Oran was headed to. She tricks Oran into staying on Earth by ordering Goodfellow to lead Sindo to the bathing spring, then altering the barrier {{that was supposed to}} hide them from humans so that Oran's gown was exposed for stealing. Seraphina uses the opportunity to achieve her ambitions and become the Queen of Avalon. Unfortunately, she is rejected again and again by the King, who constantly reminds Seraphina that no matter how hard she works, even after she becomes a 1st class faerie, she will never compare to Oran because Seraphina simply tries too hard to be something Oran comes by naturally. When Pain and Fanta arrive in Avalon, Seraphina appears again to eliminate Pain only to find that he is powerful enough to detect her spells with ease. Oreadia eventually masterminds Seraphina's downfall by using Fanta, Pain, and Syndra; Seraphina is punished for her attempt to get rid of Oreadia and reborn as a human on earth who would remember her heavenly origins only when she turned fifteen.|$|E

It’s a shame he was asked to do what he couldn’t." [...] Sports blog Deadspin ranked Timberlake the 2nd-worst player to ever play in the NFL, only behind quarterback Rusty Lisch.|$|E

It is likely that South Vietnamese soldiers indirectly {{died as a result}} of their inability to obtain fire support. Five additional aircraft were shot down during rescue attempts, directly resulting in the deaths of 11 airmen, the capture of two others, and another airman trying to evade capture.|$|E
500|$|The result marked Manchester United's first Shield {{defeat in}} 13 years, {{and was the}} ninth time Arsenal had won the Charity Shield. Arsenal became the first {{southern}} club since Tottenham Hotspur in 1962 to win the Shield outright. Wenger described the scoreline as [...] "unexpected" [...] and cited the first goal as crucial in the match, given the weather conditions. He was content with how his international players, {{who had been in}} the World Cup, coped with the game's physicality. Wenger believed the result gave Arsenal a psychological boost for the Champions League campaign, as the club planned to stage their home matches at Wembley Stadium. Bergkamp felt the result showed that Arsenal had <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> to retain the Premier League title: [...] "We've still got the same mentality and that will be the basis for this year's challenge.

500|$|On July 25, 1967, Forrestal reached Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin {{and joined}} Operation Rolling Thunder, the 1965–1968 air interdiction and {{strategic}} bombing campaign against North Vietnam. [...] The alpha strikes flown from Forrestal were against specific, pre-selected targets such as arms depots, factories, and bridges. [...] They were quite dangerous, {{due to the}} strength of the North Vietnamese air defenses, which used Soviet-designed and -supplied surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery, and MiG jet interceptors. [...] McCain's first five attack missions over North Vietnam went without incident, and while still unconcerned with minor Navy regulations, McCain had garnered the reputation of a serious aviator. McCain and his fellow pilots were frustrated by the micromanagement of Rolling Thunder from Washington; he later wrote, [...] "The target list was so restricted that we had to go back and hit the same targets over and over again... Most of our pilots flying the missions believed that our targets were virtually worthless.

[...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide stated that, while the episode [...] "doesn’t do a lot to expand the character", it [...] "manages a reasonable number of yuks". He added that [...] "A fun Howard Stern-esque character done by Michael McKean helps make this a nice show." [...] David Plath of DVD Town wrote that the episode has [...] "Some funny moments".

[...] Bob Wisehart of The Sacramento Bee said, [...] "The {{bottom line is that}} while NYPD Blue is a fine show [...] it was on my 10-best list for 1993 [...] Homicide is better. There's been nothing like it since the heyday of Hill Street Blues." [...] Elaine Liner, television critic with the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, who called Homicide [...] "as rewarding an hour of serious, quality television as you could ask for", praised it for highlighting quality writing rather than gimmicks like the nudity from NYPD Blue, and praised it for fleshing out not only the detectives and victims, but the suspects too, like in [...] "Bop Gun". Ed Siegel of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "If [...] is <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> to get you to watch NYPD Blue and you decided to stay because it was grittier, better written, directed and acted than any other drama on TV, be advised that Homicide is so far superior to NYPD Blue in all those categories that if you're not , you're missing the best hour of episodic television since Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere left the air." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Two Ronnies, the BBC let Barker decide {{what he wanted to}} do. The Two Ronnies took up one third of a year to produce, {{allowing}} time for Barker and Corbett to do a solo project each. [...] Barker opted to produce some sitcom pilots shown as part of 1973's Seven of One. Two of these pilots, Open All Hours (written by Roy Clarke) and Prisoner and Escort (written by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais) became series. Prisoner and Escort became Porridge, airing from 1974–1977, with Barker starring as the cynical and cunning prisoner Norman Stanley Fletcher. Porridge was the first sitcom to take place in a prison; The Times said the show [...] "was about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> to survive in prison, the little day-to-day triumphs over the system that kept the prisoners sane." [...] The opening sequence of the programme showed Fletcher being directed to his cell, as prison doors are locked behind him, all the while the judge can be heard pronouncing judgement and sentence. The judge's voice was performed by Barker. [...] The show became a huge success, attracting 15 million viewers and earning what the BBC described as [...] "a chorus of critical acclaim and public adoration for what {{remains one of the most}} classic British sitcoms ever produced." [...] The Times called Fletcher his [...] "finest creation". Barker privately regarded the series as the finest work of his career. He won the BAFTA for Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1975 for his performance.|$|E

[...] There was also fear that the Board of Regents was too focused on expanding the system's two-year colleges {{at the expense of}} MSU.
