25|$|Prior to {{installing}} the bus lane cameras, there were disputes between the MTA and the City of New York over <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> the {{revenue from the}} tickets. At first the MTA refused to allow the cameras until the city would agree to split the revenue. The city regularly reports revenue from violations issued by the automated cameras. In one instance a camera issued nearly 7,200 violations in a two-month period, translating {{to an average of}} 115 tickets a day, and raising about $823,000 in fine revenue.|$|E
25|$|When {{a player}} owns {{all of the}} {{properties}} in a color group {{and none of them}} are mortgaged, they may develop them during their turn or in between other player's turns. Development involves buying miniature houses or hotels from the bank and placing them on the property spaces, and must be done uniformly across the group. That is, a second house cannot be built on any property within a group until all of them have one house. Once the player owns an entire group, they can collect double rent for any undeveloped properties within it. Although houses and hotels cannot be built on railroads or utilities, the given rent also increases if a player owns more than one of either type. If there is more demand for houses to be built than what remains in the bank, then a housing auction is conducted to determine <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> to purchase each house.|$|E

25|$|In {{the human}} case, {{according}} to FCC, evolving females with increasingly heavy childcare burdens {{would have done}} best by resisting attempts at harem-holding by locally dominant males. No human female needs a partner <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> her pregnant only to disappear, abandoning her in favour of his next sexual partner. To any local group of females, the more such philandering can be successfully resisted—and the greater the proportion of previously excluded males who can {{be included in the}} breeding system and persuaded to invest effort—the better. By evolving concealed ovulation and continuous receptivity, females force males into longer periods of consortship if they are to {{have a good chance of}} achieving impregnation (figures c,d). Reproductive synchrony —whether seasonal, lunar or a combination of the two—is a key strategy for reproductive levelling, reducing paternity skew and involving more males in investment in offspring. Greater reproductive synchrony owing to seasonality during glacial cycles may have differentiated Neanderthal reproductive strategies from those of Homo sapiens ancestors.|$|E
500|$|For {{the series}} finale, Mowry and Hall reprised {{their roles as}} Melanie and Derwin even though Mowry had written on her Facebook page {{that she would not}} {{reappear}} on the show. Hall announced their return during the 2015 BET Awards, where the show's cast had attended to say [...] "their final goodbyes". Discussing the direction intended for Melanie and Derwin's final appearance, Brock Akil said: [...] "To bring these characters back to shore is such a blessing. They get an ending. They get closure." [...] She added that their storyline would appeal to the show's fans, explaining: [...] "I feel creatively we've been able to answer those who have been loyal to us.

500|$|USA Todays Robert Bianco credits Rachel's {{pregnancy}} storyline with saving Friends, {{observing that}} the arc increased the show's ratings while ultimately [...] "reversing the show's decline in ways ... {{that no one}} watching 'The One With Monica & Chandler's Wedding' could ever have imagined." [...] Bianco concluded, [...] "Indeed, without that fortune-altering twist, Friends probably would have ended sooner". BDCwire ranked [...] "The One With The Ball", [...] "The One With Rachel’s Inadvertent Kiss", [...] "The One With The Football", [...] "The One With The Fake Party" [...] and [...] "The One In Vegas, Part One" [...] Rachel's five strongest episodes. Meanwhile, TVLine criticized Rachel for sleeping with ex-fiancé Barry in season one's [...] "The One With the Evil Orthodontist", panning the episode as [...] "cringeworthy". TVLine similarly criticized the character's role in season four's [...] "The One With The Fake Party". At times the character would generate mild controversy, specifically the second season episode [...] "The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies", during which Rachel and Monica argue over <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> to use the last remaining condom in the apartment, which Rachel ultimately wins via a game of rock-paper-scissors. Additionally, fans would often approach Aniston and scold her for decisions that Rachel makes within the show {{that they do not}} particularly agree with.|$|E
