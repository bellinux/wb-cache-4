50|$|In 1948 British Railways {{took over}} the {{operation}} of the works. Around this time (exact date unknown) the New Wagon Repair Shop was built on {{the western edge of the}} site. This consisted of 8 roads and access was by a <b>wagon</b> <b>traverser</b> (there were two older ones dating from Great Eastern days on the site as well).|$|E
50|$|A horse easily pulls five tons {{in going}} from Kilmarnock to Troon, and climbs back with empty <b>wagons,</b> <b>traversing</b> a {{gradient}} of 1 in 576. The diligence which makes this journey on the grooved track, has four iron wheels. It {{is like an}} elongated gypsy caravan; I {{think it could be}} made longer and, full of passengers, and still pulled by a single horse.|$|R

50|$|Gouldsboro State Park {{is named}} for Gouldsboro, which was in turn named for Jay Gould (1836 - 1892). Gould, a native of New York, {{acquired}} an immense fortune during the Industrial Revolution, part of which included ownership of ten {{percent of all the}} rail tracks in the United States {{at the time of his}} death. One of his railroads passed by what is now the eastern boundary of the park. Gould was also the co-owner of a tannery in nearby Thornhurst. Raw hides were shipped from the western United States and Australia on the railroads owned by Gould to Gouldsboro. The hides were then sent to Thornhurst by way of <b>wagons</b> <b>traversing</b> a plank road.|$|R
50|$|The western {{boundary}} of Tobyhanna State Park is formed by a rail line {{once owned by}} Jay Gould. Gould, a native of New York, acquired an immense fortune during the Industrial Revolution, part of which included ownership of ten {{percent of all the}} rail tracks in the United States {{at the time of his}} death. One of his railroads passed by what is now the western {{boundary of}} the park. Gould was also the co-owner of a tannery in nearby Thornhurst. Raw hides were shipped from the western United States and Australia on the railroads owned by Gould to the village of Gouldsboro (just west of the park in Wayne County). The hides were then sent to Thornhurst by way of <b>wagons</b> <b>traversing</b> a plank road.|$|R
40|$|The Karel Landman Monument in the Sundays River Valley Rural, Eastern Cape, was {{designed}} by Gerard Moerdyk and built by the Lupini Brothers. It was unveiled on 16 December 1939 by W A L Landman. It honours Karel Landman who farmed in this area until 1837 {{when he became a}} leader in the Great Trek. He led a party of 180 Trekkers and their servants on a trek of 885 kilometres into Natal where he was prominent in several battles with the Zulus and he was second in command of the Boer forces at the pivotal battle of Blood River. The commemoration of Karel Landman and his trek, in this 3 m globe with an ox <b>wagon</b> <b>traversing</b> it, was an initiative of the National Party and the councils of the Dutch Reformed Church in two neighbouring villages, Alexandria and Paterson. Legend has it that the councils could not agree which village should 'host’ the monument, so it was placed on this remote koppie overlooking the surrounding countryside, between the two villages.

50|$|The Langbein System uses claw pairs {{to form a}} yoke {{around the}} axles of the {{standard}} gauge bogies. With the bogies {{pulled out of the}} pit the standard gauge wheels can sink to the Rollbock to find support. This method enables the Rollbock <b>wagons</b> to <b>traverse</b> curves as sharp as 15 m radius and, when fully loaded, they could be moved over narrow gauge tracks at a safe speed of 13 mph.|$|R
5|$|The Rose–Baley Party was {{the first}} European American {{emigrant}} <b>wagon</b> train to <b>traverse</b> the 35th parallel route known as Beale's Wagon Road, established by Edward Fitzgerald Beale, from Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico to the Colorado River near present-day Needles, California.|$|R
2500|$|Goodale's Cutoff, {{established}} in 1862 {{on the north}} side of the Snake River, formed a spur of the Oregon Trail. This cutoff had been used as a pack trail by Indians and fur traders, and emigrant <b>wagons</b> <b>traversed</b> parts of the eastern section as early as 1852. After crossing the Snake River the [...] cutoff headed north from Fort Hall toward Big Southern Butte following the Lost River part of the way. It passed near the present-day town of Arco, and wound through the northern part of what is now Craters of the Moon National Monument. From there it went southwest to Camas Prairie and ended at Old Fort Boise on the Boise River. This journey typically took two to three weeks and was noted for its very rough lava terrain and extremely dry climate, which tended to dry the wooden wheels on the wagons, causing the iron rims to fall off the wheels. Loss of wheels caused many wagons to be abandoned along the route. It rejoined the main trail east of Boise. Goodale's Cutoff is visible at many points along U.S. Highway 20, U.S. Highway 26, and U.S. Highway 93 between Craters of the Moon National Monument and Carey.|$|R
5000|$|The Schenck House - built 1822 - {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} extant homes currently within the City of Buffalo limits. It was built by early pioneer and farmer Michael Schenck (1772-1844) and his son Samuel Schenck (Nov. 17th 1793 - Dec. 1st 1872) out of locally queried limestone, where many fossils can be seen on {{the eastern side of the}} facade. The Schenck family dates back to 1709 when they first arrived in America in an effort to escape religious persecution for being Protestant, specifically Mennonite. Just over a hundred years later they would find themselves in two covered <b>wagons,</b> <b>traversing</b> the Allegheny Mountains, and settling at the border between the City of Buffalo and Town of Amherst. Here they practiced the same farming techniques they had in Pennsylvania and earlier in Germany. These techniques by today’s standards could be termed “environmentally friendly", and Polyculture due to their use of crop rotation, production of multiple food products on a family farm, and the use of cow manure. The Schencks like other German settlers practiced the keeping and feeding of multiple types of animals; housing them in a barn through winter. This practice was considered unusual by farmers of British heritage. While the German idea of feeding and housing animals through winter was adopted by non-German farmers in the 19th century, the keeping of a variety of animals was not. Many 19th century farmers began to develop specialized farms, unofficially becoming a [...] "pig farmer" [...] or [...] "cattle rancher". Three generations of Schencks continued practicing polyculture of crops and animals even when monoculture continue to expand and “special” or synthetic fertilizers were being developed and used.|$|R
50|$|The Jeffers Petroglyphs site is an outcrop {{in southwestern}} Minnesota with pre-contact Native American petroglyphs. The petroglyphs are pecked into rock of the Red Rock Ridge, a 23 mi-long Sioux {{quartzite}} outcrop that extends from Watonwan County, Minnesota to Brown County, Minnesota. The exposed surface is approximately 150 by 650 ft {{and surrounded by}} virgin prairie. Several old <b>wagon</b> trail ruts <b>traverse</b> the site, {{one of which is}} believed to be the old stage coach route from New Ulm, Minnesota to Sioux Falls, South Dakota.|$|R
500|$|The early name {{proposed}} for these travel corridor was the Northern Yellowhead Transportation Route. [...] The Northern Woods and Water Route Association {{was established in}} 1974, their further promotion of the route was to increase tourist travel. [...] George R. Stephenson (1916–2003), of McLennan {{was one of the}} first facilitators to organise the Northern Woods and Water Route across Western Canada in 1974. [...] Henry Andres was chairman of the Northern Woods and Water Association for eight years wherein the association worked on placing NWWR signs both on provincial highways and maps. [...] Brochures promoting tourism were printed, and the association sponsored more than five cavalcades where <b>wagons</b> would <b>traverse</b> the route between Winnipeg and Dawson Creek promoting tourism and the creation of the travel corridor. [...] On August 21, 1975, one of these Northern Woods and Water Cavalcades stopped at Nipawin Regional Park and toured Nipawin.|$|R
5000|$|The wagon {{road that}} started at Cow Island Landing {{and went up}} Cow Creek, then out onto broad grassy plains and on to Ft. Benton, was called the Cow Island Trail. [...] This road up Cow Creek traversed the only {{possible}} team-and-wagon route {{in this part of}} the rough badlands known as the Missouri Breaks. At 35 miles long, Cow Creek is one of the longer Missouri tributaries in the breaks. It extends north to the Bearpaw Mountains where it receives seasonal spring snow melt. Over many millenniums, this greater seasonal discharge eroded and widened the creek bottom so it became flat enough for a team and <b>wagon</b> to <b>traverse.</b> From the steamboat landing on the Missouri, the trail went north up the Cow Creek bottom for 15 mi to Davidson Coulee, at which time the trail turned west and climbed up a long steep grade on Davidson Ridge to reach the plains north of the Missouri River Breaks.|$|R
50|$|With the passes of the Sierras and the Rocky Mountains blocked in winter, another winter route, the Mormon Road between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles was {{developed}} by a Mormon expedition from their new settlements at and around Salt Lake City, and by some Mormon Battalion soldiers returning to Utah in 1847-48. The first significant use of the route was by parties of Forty-Niners late in 1849, and by some Mormon trains, to avoid crossing the snow bound Sierra Nevada Mountains by linking up with the Old Spanish Trail in southern Utah and closely following it, with alterations to {{the route of the}} mule trails only to allow <b>wagons</b> to <b>traverse</b> it for the first time. Soon afterward it was the route Mormon colonists followed to settle southwestern Utah, a mission in Las Vegas and a colony in San Bernardino, California. This wagon route, also called by some of its early travelers the Southern Route, of the California Trail, remained a minor migration route and in the early 1850s a mail route. After some alterations of the route between Cajon Pass and the border of California and in southern Utah, in 1855, it became a significant seasonal trade route between California and Utah, until 1869, when the transcontinental railroad ended Utah's winter isolation.|$|R
25|$|Under the Spanish colonial system, {{trade between}} Americans and the Spanish outpost at Santa Fe was prohibited, {{but with the}} end of the Mexican War of Independence Spanish {{authorities}} were removed from the area in 1821. American traders, mainly operating out of St. Louis, Missouri, were eager to test whether commercial activities in Santa Fe would now be allowed, and a small group of Americans returned successfully in December 1821 from a small trading foray. At age 18 Young sold the farm he had recently purchased and eagerly signed up to join a somewhat larger group bound for Santa Fe. In May 1822 this party departed, becoming the first overland <b>wagon</b> train to <b>traverse</b> the Santa Fe Trail. Young and the others found that they were welcomed by the new Mexican authorities in Santa Fe.|$|R
