Open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) is the most popular surgical approach, utilizing a lateral approach to expose fragments, obtain reduction, and stabilize by plating with additional bone grafting [1].

40|$|A {{developed}} {{software is}} used to study {{the effect of the}} cylinder wall temperature profile on the second-law transient performance of a turbocharged diesel engine. The simulation, based on the filling and emptying approach, includes analysis of mechanical friction per degree crank angle, mathematical simulation of the fuel pump, while each equation in the model is solved separately for every cylinder of the six-cylinder diesel engine under study. The model is validated against experimental data for various load changes. A second-law analysis is performed for every process of the diesel engine covering its transient operation. The effect of the cylinder wall temperature profile on the second-law transient response of the engine is depicted in detailed, multiple diagrams. Special reference is made to the interesting low heat rejection (""adiabatic"") case. It is shown from the analysis that after a ramp increase in load the second-law terms including the various irreversibilities ones, unlike their first law counterparts, are heavily impacted by the cylinder wall temperature variation, thus providing an increased potential for extra <b>work</b> <b>recovery.</b> This fact best highlights the results of the second-law analysis and its diversification as compared to the first-law theory. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify predictors of fatigue caseness, work resumption and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) -like caseness in a sample of fatigued employees on sick leave. METHODS: For 12 months, 151 fatigued employees on sick leave, 44 % of whom met research criteria for CFS at baseline, were followed. Measures included fatigue, health aspects, psychological problems, burnout, causal attributions and self-efficacy. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine associations between predictor variables at baseline and outcome at follow-up. RESULTS: After 12 months, 43 % of the patients were no longer fatigue cases, and 62 % had resumed <b>work.</b> <b>Recovery</b> from fatigue caseness was predicted by stronger psychological attributions and other perception-related factors, whereas work resumption was predicted by lower age, male sex, CFS-like caseness and less cognitive difficulties. Lower physical functioning scores were predictive of (the development of) CFS-like caseness. CONCLUSION: Recovering from persistent fatigue and work resumption seem to result from different underlying processes and do not necessarily fall together. As many factors associated with outcome in fatigue reflect illness perception, the prevention of persistent fatigue and CFS may partly be achieved by the modification of perception...|$|E

We examined how daily off-job (work-related, physical, household) activities, in combination with the degree to which people want to engage in these activities relate to self–family facilitation (i. e., the positive influence of the fulfilment of one's own interests on one's family life). Further, we tested whether self–family facilitation relates to psychological detachment from <b>work,</b> <b>recovery,</b> and finally whether recovery relates to job performance. Multilevel analyses revealed that household activities enhance self–family facilitation only on days that people want to engage in such activities. Furthermore, spending time on household activities hinders psychological detachment on days people do not want to spend time on these activities. In addition, self–family facilitation and psychological detachment relate to better recovery the next morning. Finally, feeling recovered in the morning is beneficial for task performance during work. These findings emphasize the role of one's 2 ̆ 2 wants 2 ̆ 2 in the degree to which off-job activities lead to recovery.

40|$|<b>Work</b> <b>recovery</b> {{research}} has focused mainly on how after-work break activities help employees replenish their resources and reduce fatigue. Given that employees spend {{a considerable amount of}} time at work, understanding how they can replenish their resources during the workday is critical. Drawing on ego depletion (Muraven & Baumeister, 2000) and self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985), we employed multi-source experience sampling methods to test the effects of a critical boundary condition, employee lunch break autonomy, on the relation between lunch break activities and end-of-workday fatigue. Although specific energy-relevant activities had a main effect on end-of-workday fatigue, each of these was moderated by the degree of autonomous choice associated with the break. Specifically, for activities that supported the psychological needs of relatedness and competence (i. e., social and work activities, respectively), as lunch break autonomy increased, effects switched from increasing fatigue to reducing fatigue. To the extent that lunch break activities involved relaxation, however, lunch break autonomy was only important when levels of relaxation were low. We conclude that lunch break autonomy plays a complex and pivotal role in conferring the potential energetic benefits of lunch break activities. Contributions to theory and practice are discussed.

40|$|Multilevel {{surgery is}} {{commonly}} performed to improve walking {{in children with}} cerebral palsy (CP). Classical gait analysis (kinetics, kinematics) demonstrated positive outcomes after this intervention, however it doesn't give global indication about gait's features. The assessment of energy cost and mechanical work of locomotion can provide an overall description of walking functionality. Therefore, we propose to describe the effects of multilevel surgery in children with CP, considering energetics, mechanical work, kinetic and kinematic of walking. We measured external, internal, total work, energy cost, recovery, efficiency, kinetic and kinematic of walking in 10 children with CP (4 girls, 6 boys; 13 years ± 2) before and 1 year after multilevel surgery. Kinetic and kinematic results are partially comparable to previous findings, energy cost of walking is significantly reduced (p < 0. 05); external, internal, total <b>work,</b> <b>recovery,</b> efficiency are not significantly different (p = 0. 129; p = 0. 147; p = 0. 795; p = 0. 119; p = 0. 21).

Therefore {{it is conceivable that}} the improvement of walking economy depend on a reduced effort of the muscle to maintain the posture, rather then to an improvement of the mechanism of energy recovery typical of human locomotion...|$|E
