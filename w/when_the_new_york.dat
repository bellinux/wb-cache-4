Hays with Mrs. Hays being the passive recipient whose hands guided the Ouija board. Previously Hutchings tried to contact Patience Worth. The two mediums claimed to have started transcribing the novel in 1915 and to have taken 2 years to complete. Due to the popularity of Ouija Board at the time, many Americans purchased the book and accepted Hutchings' claims at face value.|$|R

5|$|The {{origins of}} NY37B {{date back to}} the early 20th century <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> State Legislature created Route32, an {{unsigned}} legislative route extending from North Lawrence to Ogdensburg via Massena. From Waddington to Massena, Route32 followed River Road and Town Line Road. This portion of the route became part of NY3 in 1924. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the Waddington–Massena segment of NY3 became NY37B. The route was extended east into Massena in the 1950s after NY37 was realigned to follow a new bypass around the village.|$|E

5|$|Helen Whittier had {{returned}} to intercoastal service by early 1934 <b>when</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Times reported that she had sailed from San Francisco on 23 March and arrived at New York on 25 April. In June that same year, Helen Whittier {{was one of the}} Matson ships added to carry food cargo to Hawaii. Shipments of food from the mainland—which accounted for up to 90% of Hawaii's needs—had been curtailed as a coastwise strike had affected all ports except Los Angeles. Helen Whittier sailed on her first food delivery on 23 June with 2,500 tons of food from Los Angeles to Honolulu.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1907 – {{also known}} as the 1907 Bankers' Panic or Knickerbocker Crisis – was a United States {{financial}} crisis that took place over a three-week period starting in mid-October, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Stock Exchange fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year. Panic occurred, as this was during a time of economic recession, and there were numerous runs on banks and trust companies. The 1907 panic eventually spread throughout the nation when many state and local banks and businesses entered bankruptcy. Primary causes of the run included a retraction of market liquidity by a number of New York City banks and a loss of confidence among depositors, exacerbated by unregulated side bets at bucket shops.|$|E
5|$|Two {{sections}} {{of what is}} now NY167 were included as part of legislative routes <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> State Legislature created a statewide legislative route system in 1908. From Richfield Springs to Paines Hollow, it was designated as part of Route5, which continued southeast to Kingston via Oneonta and northwest to Mohawk. The section {{of what is now}} NY167 north of Little Falls became part of Route26, which ran from Little Falls to Remsen via Dolgeville. In 1910, Route26 was realigned to follow a more direct routing between Little Falls and Remsen via Middleville and Poland. The former alignment of Route26 between Little Falls and Dolgeville went unnumbered until March1, 1921, when it became part of Route37, which was extended southwestward from Dolgeville to Little Falls.|$|E

5|$|The Ohio {{legislature}} had elected Garfield to the Senate in 1880, {{and when}} he was elected President before taking his seat, they elected Sherman in his place. Sherman's position in the Senate changed after his four-year absence. He rejoined the Finance Committee, but Justin Smith Morrill, his old House colleague, now held the chairmanship. When Sherman re-entered the Senate in the 47th United States Congress, the Republicans were not in the majority. The Senate was divided among 37 Republicans, 37 Democrats, one independent (David Davis) who caucused with the Democrats, and one Readjuster (William Mahone), who caucused with the Republicans. Arthur's tie-breaking vote as Vice President left the Republicans with a narrow hold on the chamber. Even so, the special session convened in March 1881 remained deadlocked for two months over Garfield's nominations because of Conkling's opposition to some of them, resulting in the resignation of Conkling and the other Senator from New York, Thomas C. Platt, in protest of Garfield's continuing opposition to their faction. Sherman sided with Garfield on the appointments and was pleased <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> legislature declined to reelect Conkling and Platt, replacing them with two less troublesome Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia's major {{industries}} {{of the era}} were the Baldwin Locomotive Works, William Cramp and Sons Ship and Engine Building Company, and the Pennsylvania Railroad. Westward expansion of the Pennsylvania Railroad helped Philadelphia keep up with nearby New York City in domestic commerce, as both cities fought for dominance in transporting iron and coal resources from Pennsylvania. Philadelphia's other local railroad was the Reading Railroad, but {{after a series of}} bankruptcies, it was taken over by New Yorkers. The Panic of 1873, which occurred <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City branch of the Philadelphia bank Jay Cooke and Company failed, and another panic in the 1890s hampered Philadelphia's economic growth. While the depressions hurt the city, its diverse array of industries helped it weather difficult times. It had numerous iron and steel-related manufacturers, including Philadelphian-owned iron and steel works outside the city, most notably the Bethlehem Iron Company in the city by that name. The largest industry in Philadelphia was textiles. Philadelphia produced more textiles than any other U.S. city; in 1904 the textile industry employed more than 35 percent of the city's workers. The cigar, sugar, and oil industries also were strong in the city. During this time the major department stores: Wanamaker's, Gimbels, Strawbridge and Clothier, and Lit Brothers, were developed along Market Street.|$|E

25|$|The gold {{standard}} was suspended twice during World War I, once fully {{and then for}} foreign exchange. At {{the onset of the}} war, U.S. corporations had large debts payable to European entities, who began liquidating their debts in gold. With debts looming to Europe, the dollar to British pound exchange rate reached as high as $6.75, far above the (gold) parity of $4.8665. This caused large gold outflows until July 31, 1914, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Stock Exchange closed and the {{gold standard}} was temporarily suspended. In order to defend the exchange value of the dollar, the US Treasury Department authorized state and nationally chartered banks to issue emergency currency under the Aldrich-Vreeland Act, and the newly created Federal Reserve organized a fund to assure debts to foreign creditors. These efforts were largely successful, and the Aldrich-Vreeland notes were retired starting in November and the gold standard was restored <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Stock Exchange re-opened in December 1914.|$|E
