30|$|The {{duration}} of the endometrial wound healing differs according {{to the type of}} pathology as reported by Yang and coworkers in a prospective cohort study of 163 women undergoing operative hysteroscopy [5]. At second-look hysteroscopy 1  month after operative hysteroscopy, more women achieved a full healing of the endometrial cavity after removal of endometrial polyps (32 / 37 <b>women</b> <b>or</b> 86  %) compared to adhesiolysis (30 / 45 <b>women</b> <b>or</b> 67  %), metroplasty (3 / 16 <b>women</b> <b>or</b> 19  %), or myomectomy (12 / 65 <b>women</b> <b>or</b> 18  %) (P[*]<[*] 0.05). Significantly more women suffered from de novo IUAs at second-look hysteroscopy after metroplasty (14 / 16 <b>women</b> <b>or</b> 88  %) or adhesiolysis (34 / 45 <b>women</b> <b>or</b> 76  %) compared to removal of submucous fibroids (26 / 65 <b>women</b> <b>or</b> 40  %) or endometrial polyps (0 / 37 <b>women</b> <b>or</b> 0  %). <b>Women</b> with de novo IUAs were less likely to achieve full endometrial wound healing within 1  month compared with those without adhesions (23 / 74 <b>women</b> <b>or</b> 31  % versus 54 / 89 <b>women</b> <b>or</b> 61  %, P[*]=[*] 0.0003). The authors conclude that the time needed for a complete recovery of the endometrium ranges from 1 to 3  months, following, respectively, the hysteroscopic removal of endometrial polyps and submucous fibroids.|$|R

5|$|Hamm {{represented}} the United States at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. During the group stage, she scored a goal against Norway {{to lift the}} United States to a 2–0 win. The team tied China 1–1 in their next group stage match before defeating Nigeria 3–1 to finish first in their group. After advancing to the semi-finals where the U.S. faced Brazil, Hamm scored the game-winning goal in the 60th minute. The goal marked the 127th of her international career and set a new record for most goals scored in international play by a <b>woman</b> <b>or</b> man. The U.S. faced Norway in the final and were defeated 3–2 in overtime to earn the silver medal at the Games.|$|E
5|$|In Serbia, men {{believed}} to possess properties of an ala were called aloviti (ala-like) men, {{and they were}} given several explanations. An ala may have sneaked into them; these were recognized by their voracity, because the ala, {{in order to satisfy}} her excessive hunger, drove them to eat incessantly. They may also have survived an ala blowing on them– an ala’s breath is usually lethal to humans. These people would then become exceptionally strong. Alternatively, they could be the offspring of an ala and a <b>woman,</b> <b>or</b> could have been born covered with the caul. It was believed that aloviti men could not be killed with a gun or arrow, unless gold or silver was used.|$|E

5|$|Sexuality is an {{important}} part of each person's identity, although some people might have no interest in sex. Sexuality has biological, psychological, emotional, spiritual, social, and cultural aspects. It involves not only sexual behaviors but relationships, self-image, sex drive, reproduction, sexual orientation, and gender expression. Each person's sexuality is influenced by lifelong socialization, in which factors such as religious and cultural background play a part, and is expressed in self-esteem and the beliefs one holds about oneself (identifying as a <b>woman,</b> <b>or</b> as an attractive person).|$|E

He was married to the sister of the Sasanian king Khosrow II, Mirhran, with whom Shahrbaraz had one boy named Shapur-i Shahrvaraz.

5|$|The Haraldskær <b>Woman</b> (<b>or</b> Haraldskjaer Woman) is a bog {{body of a}} woman found {{naturally}} {{preserved in}} a bog in Jutland, Denmark, and dating from about 490 BC (pre-Roman Iron Age). Workers found the body in 1835 while excavating peat on the Haraldskær Estate. The anaerobic conditions and acids of the peat bog contributed to the body's excellent preservation. Not only was the intact skeleton found, but so were the skin and internal organs. Scientists settled disputes about the age and identity of this well preserved body in 1977, when radiocarbon dating determined conclusively that the woman's death occurred around the 5th century BC.|$|E

5|$|Over its 950 {{years of}} history Warwick Castle has been owned by 36 {{different}} individuals, plus four periods as crown property under seven different monarchs. It was the family seat of three separate creations of the Earls of Warwick, {{and has been a}} family home for members of the Beaumont, Beauchamp, Neville, Plantagenet, Dudley and Greville families. The first creation of the Earldom specifically included the right of inheritance through the female line, so the castle three times had a <b>woman</b> (<b>or</b> girl) as the owner. Eleven of the owners were under 20 when they inherited, including a girl aged two and a boy aged three. At least three owners died in battle, two were executed and one murdered. Every century except the 21st has seen major building work or adaptations at the castle.|$|E
5|$|The name Malkin {{has several}} {{possible}} derivations: {{it was a}} familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman; the similar mawkin was a word used to describe a lower-class <b>woman</b> <b>or</b> slut. Malkin was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in grimalkin or grey malkin, and was an old northern English name for a hare, into which witches {{were said to be}} able to transfigure. It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of mal and kin as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower, which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time. Another possibility is a corruption of malt kiln, which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.|$|E
5|$|The poems {{were written}} during {{a short period}} while the poet lived in Germany. Although they {{individually}} deal {{with a variety of}} themes, as a series they focus on the poet's longing for the company of his friend Coleridge, who had stayed in England, and on his increasing impatience with his sister Dorothy, who had travelled with him abroad. Wordsworth examines the poet's unrequited love for the idealised character of Lucy, an English girl who has died young. The idea of her death weighs heavily on the poet throughout the series, imbuing it with a melancholic, elegiac tone. Whether Lucy was based on a real <b>woman</b> <b>or</b> was a figment of the poet's imagination has long been a matter of debate among scholars. Generally reticent about the poems, Wordsworth never revealed the details of her origin or identity. Some scholars speculate that Lucy is based on his sister Dorothy, while others see her as a fictitious or hybrid character. Most critics agree that she is essentially a literary device upon whom he could project, meditate and reflect.|$|E
