30|$|Reintubation is {{necessary}} in 10 – 100 % of patients with post-extubation laryngeal edema or stridor [21]. In our study, the rate of reintubation due to upper airway obstruction was 87.5 %, representing {{a third of all}} patients <b>who</b> <b>required</b> reintubation. The mortality in patients <b>who</b> <b>required</b> reintubation was 33.3 %, but the crude mortality in the group of patients with upper airway obstruction <b>who</b> <b>required</b> reintubation was 14.2 % and suggests that, unlike reintubation for other reasons, reintubation for transitory upper airway obstruction is probably not associated with increased mortality.|$|R
5|$|Physiotherapy {{interventions}} include strength, {{endurance and}} gait training with graduated increases in mobility, maintenance of posture and alignment {{as well as}} joint function. Occupational therapy aims to improve everyday function with domestic and community tasks as well as driving and work. Home modifications, gait aids, orthotics and splints may be provided. Speech-language pathology input may be required in those with speech and swallowing problems, {{as well as to}} support communication in those <b>who</b> <b>require</b> ongoing breathing support (often through a tracheostomy). Nutritional support may be provided by the team and by dietitians. Psychologists may provide counseling and support. Psychological interventions may also be required for anxiety, fear and depression.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the drug begin 10–40minutes after ingestion, and last 2–6hours {{depending}} on dose, species, and individual metabolism. The half life of psilocybin is 163±64minutes when taken orally, or 74.1±19.6minutes when injected intravenously. A dosage of 4–10mg, corresponding roughly to 50–300micrograms per kilogram (µg/kg) of body weight, is required to induce psychedelic effects. A typical recreational dosage is 10–50mg psilocybin, which is roughly equivalent to 10–50grams of fresh mushrooms, or 1–5grams of dried mushrooms. A {{small number of people}} are unusually sensitive to psilocybin, such that a normally threshold-level dose of about 2mg can result in effects usually associated with medium or high doses. In contrast, there are some <b>who</b> <b>require</b> relatively high doses to experience noticeable effects. Individual brain chemistry and metabolism play a large role in determining a person's response to psilocybin.|$|E
5|$|As a maximum-security prison, it hosts {{dangerous}} {{as well as}} highly dangerous criminals, such as rapists, murderers, and child molesters. They compose half of the population, while {{a third of the}} residents are drug offenders. Sex offenders, who may face violence from other inmates, and prisoners <b>who</b> <b>require</b> close psychiatric or medical supervision, are located in Unit A, a restrictive and separated area. There is also a special unit (C8) focused on addiction recovery. Most inmates live in Units B and C, which are freer and have mixed cell blocks. Halden Prison receives both domestic and international criminals; as only around three-fifths of the prisoners are Norwegians (as of 2015), both Norwegian and English are used, and the prison has English teachers. However, fluency in Norwegian is a requirement to live in C8, because group and individual counseling is conducted in Norwegian.|$|E

5|$|Despite some claims, {{such as that}} by the {{historian}} Max von Boehm, that the largest crinolines measured up to ten yards (30feet) around, the photohistorian Alison Gernsheim concluded that the maximum realistic circumference was in fact between five-and-a-half and six yards. Whilst a loosely gathered skirt draped over a large hoop would certainly require a higher yardage, Gernsheim noted that ten yard hems were highly improbable. Staged photographs showing women wearing exaggeratedly large crinolines were quite popular, such as a widely published sequence of five stereoscope views showing a woman dressing {{with the assistance of}} several maids <b>who</b> <b>require</b> long poles to lift her dress over her head and other ingenious means of navigating her enormous hoopskirt. Such photographs, which re-enacted contemporary caricatures rather than accurately reflecting reality, were aimed towards the voyeur's market. However, it was a fact that the size of the crinoline often caused difficulties in passing through doors, boarding carriages and generally moving about. By the late 1860s many crinolines were of a significantly reduced size, as noted by a Victoria and Albert Museum curator observing the sizes of cage crinolines in the Museum's collection.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010, {{there were}} 6,260 people {{employed}} in the healthcare field in Lauderdale County. Rush Hospital is the largest healthcare organization in the region, employing 2,610 people, followed by East Mississippi State Hospital with 1,500 and Anderson Hospital with 1,475. There are three hospitals in Meridian, {{as well as many}} other healthcare-related facilities. Jeff Anderson Regional Medical Center provides cardiovascular surgery, a Level II newborn intensive-care unit, and a health and fitness center. Rush Foundation Hospital and the related Rush Health Systems operate a Specialty Hospital of Meridian, which offers long-term care for non-permanent patients <b>who</b> <b>require</b> more recovery time in a hospital setting. Riley Hospital has two centers for stroke treatment and rehabilitation services. Other healthcare facilities in Meridian include the Alliance Health Center and East Mississippi State Hospital, the latter of which has been in operation since 1882.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of gastroenteritis in {{both children and}} adults is rehydration. This is preferably achieved by drinking rehydration solution, although intravenous delivery may be required {{if there is a}} decreased level of consciousness or if dehydration is severe. Drinking replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates (i.e. those made from wheat or rice) may be superior to those based on simple sugars. Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase diarrhea. Plain water may be used if more specific ORT preparations are unavailable or the person is not willing to drink them. A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted. In those <b>who</b> <b>require</b> intravenous fluids, one to four hours' worth is often sufficient.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} team envisioned Japanese cities as entities, <b>who</b> <b>require</b> physical agents to execute their will and regulate the activities within them. The concept behind {{the health of}} a city is based on traditional Chinese medicine in which the smooth flow of a body's fluids nourishes its internal organs. The team equates yōkai with qi, humans with water, and agents of the city (karas) with blood. They integrated Celtic mythology into their concept for further symbolisms, treating the city as the male (yang); and , the manifestation of its will as female (yin). In contrast, their theory treats the humans and agents as the children of the city and its will, and classifies them as the reproduction system's five major organs. Following the team's vision, the mikuras (evil yōkai) represent the five elements in this system. This idea forms the basis of the relationship between cities and their inhabitants in the show.|$|E
5|$|He also {{missed the}} {{opportunity}} to lead the original Sinister Six because he felt that joining the group would mean admitting he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider-Man. Although he later formed the 'Sinister Twelve' when Spider-Man sent him to prison, he expressed anger at Mac Gargan for acquiring the Venom symbiote rather than using the new Scorpion suit provided for him simply because Gargan was not doing what he wanted, despite Venom being {{more powerful than the}} Scorpion. When he participated in the mystical ritual known as the Gathering of Five, he appeared convinced that he would automatically receive the gift of power from the ritual– which would bestow upon the participants power, immortality, knowledge, madness and death, respectively– only to receive the gift of madness instead, subsequently requiring an elaborate cocktail of drugs to restore himself to a semblance of sanity. During his time in charge of H.A.M.M.E.R. he was provoked into attacking Asgard by his Goblin side because his ego couldn't allow himself to consider the possibility that the Asgardians wouldn't threaten his power. Later events revealed that Loki at least slightly influenced Osborn's decision to further Loki's own goals. During his attempted takeover of Earth's superhuman security defenses, he was shown reflecting that humans are all barbarians <b>who</b> <b>require</b> the strong like him to control them, dismissing the Avengers as no better than him despite the obvious distinction between Osborn's demands for power and the straightforward respect that the general public have for the Avengers.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, the Home Office {{published}} a report evaluating {{the effectiveness of}} the Gateway Protection Programme. The research it was based upon focused on refugees' integration into British society in the 18 months following their resettlement. The research found that refugees showed signs of integration, including the formation of social bonds through community groups and places of worship. The report noted that low employment rates and slow progress with acquiring English language skills were particular concerns. Younger refugees and children had made the most progress. No specific language lessons are provided under the Gateway Protection Programme. Instead, Gateway refugees <b>who</b> <b>require</b> help with their English language skills are provided with access to mainstream English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) courses, which are run by a range of state, voluntary and community-based organisations. However, the International Catholic Migration Commission (ICMC) Europe reports that in Sheffield, it can be difficult for resettled refugees to gain access to ESOL classes because demand has generally exceeded supply – a situation also noted by an evaluation of the scheme's operation in Motherwell undertaken in 2013. The Motherwell evaluation found that most of the male refugees were in employment, but that many of them were not in jobs that allowed them to use their skills. The majority of women were not in work, reflecting a lack of job opportunities but also a lack of childcare provision.|$|E
