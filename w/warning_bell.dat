25|$|Sciota {{is served}} by the Keokuk Junction Railway. As of January 2010, there were two rail sidings. There is one grade {{crossing}} protected {{by a pair of}} crossbucks with flashing lights and a mechanical <b>warning</b> <b>bell</b> (no gates).|$|E
25|$|In most jurisdictions, {{bicycles}} {{must have}} functioning {{front and rear}} lights when ridden after dark. As some generator or dynamo-driven lamps only operate while moving, rear reflectors are frequently also mandatory. Since a moving bicycle makes little noise, some countries insist that bicycles have a <b>warning</b> <b>bell</b> for use when approaching pedestrians, equestrians, and other cyclists, though sometimes a car horn can be used when a 12 volt battery is available.|$|E

50|$|The tunnel was {{originally}} equipped with seven sets of <b>warning</b> <b>bells.</b> Corrosion {{due to the}} damp atmosphere required frequent repainting of metal parts.|$|R
25|$|The {{signalling}} system will control train traffic {{to keep it}} safely spaced and on schedule, share train location information publicly (e.g., digital and audio announcements at LRT stations), and manage intersections by triggering traffic signals and crossing <b>warning</b> systems (<b>warning</b> <b>bells,</b> flashing lights and gates).|$|R
500|$|In the {{subsequent}} investigation, metal fatigue was ultimately {{blamed for the}} failure of the number five compressor wheel in the number two Rolls-Royce 508 Conway turbofan engine, starting the rapid chain of failures. [...] The crew's omitting to shut off the fuel to the engine was blamed for the rapid growth of the fire and the loss of the aircraft. Check Captain Moss had accidentally cancelled the fire <b>warning</b> <b>bell</b> instead of the undercarriage <b>warning</b> <b>bell.</b> Moss had also issued orders to Captain Taylor, in breach of the normal protocol for his duties. However, the report on the accident also stated that Captain Taylor had briefed Moss to act as an extra set of eyes and ears inside and outside the cockpit. Moss's actions therefore could be seen as acting within that remit. Although Moss had alerted the crew to the fire, none of them were aware that the number 2 engine had fallen off until after the evacuation on the ground.|$|E

60|$|Can the fellow's threats have {{something}} in them and this be the <b>warning</b> <b>bell</b> of which he spoke? Surely it is impossible. Yet his manner was indescribably impressive.|$|E
50|$|Robertson's unusually kind {{behaviour}} towards children {{sets off}} <b>warning</b> <b>bells</b> {{in your head}} especially when he is {{shown to be a}} pedophile who exercises like mad within the confines of his home, always moving on towards his next target. How the couple save their child forms the rest of the story.|$|R
5000|$|According to legend, {{the hills}} were <b>warning</b> <b>bells,</b> or tocsins, used by local First Nations for signaling. These [...] "Bell Rocks" [...] {{could be heard}} for a {{considerable}} distance when struck, and accordingly when voyageurs explored the area they named it with the French word for “bell” — La Cloche.|$|R
40|$|A {{survey was}} done by Teradata University Network among {{academics}} associated with the Association for Information Systems for discussion during the 2009 Business Intelligence Congress in Phoenix Arizona, December 2009.

6000|$|It has drifted, waterlogged, Till by {{trailing}} weeds beclogged: [...] Drifted, drifted, day by day, [...] Pilotless on pathless way.

6000|$|A pirate named [...] "Sir Ralph the Rover" [...] {{came there}} {{one day and}} cut away the bell in a wicked frolic. Long years after, {{returning}} with a rich cargo of ill-gotten wealth, retributive justice overtook Sir Ralph, caused his vessel to strike on the Inch Cape Rock--for want of the <b>warning</b> <b>bell</b> which he had cut away--and sent him and his belongings to the bottom.|$|E
60|$|In the {{softened}} {{light of}} the window, looking {{from the scene of}} her early trials to the shining sky, she was not in stronger opposition to the black figure in the shade than the life and doctrine on which she rested were to that figure's history. It bent its head low again, and said not a word. It remained thus, until the first <b>warning</b> <b>bell</b> began to ring.|$|E
40|$|Many {{people saw}} this crisis coming and sound <b>warning</b> <b>bells</b> {{ahead of the}} {{subprime}} crisis, but they were ignored.

25|$|The {{crossing}} was of {{inherently dangerous}} design, in {{that a long}} vehicle could be trapped partly on the crossing while held by a red light at the intersection. If the driver had realized the danger, she would still {{have been forced to}} pull through a red light to clear the track when the <b>warning</b> <b>bells</b> sounded.|$|R
60|$|Well, {{it looks}} as if their trials were very nearly over. Sir Charles Warren's Division marches to Frere to-day. All the {{hospitals}} have been cleared ready for those who may need them. If all's well we shall have removed the grounds of reproach by this day week. The long interval between the acts has come to an end. The <b>warning</b> <b>bell</b> has rung. Take your seats, ladies and gentlemen. The curtain is about to rise.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} the <b>warning</b> <b>bell,</b> a single stroke fifteen {{minutes before the}} change of watch, rang out from the wheel and was {{repeated}} by the look- out on the forecastle head. Mr. Pike, under his stress of feeling, had stopped walking, and we stood at the break of the poop. As chance would have it, Mr. Mellaire was {{a quarter of an}} hour ahead of time, and he climbed the poop-ladder and stood beside us while the mate concluded his tale.|$|E
60|$|Autumn {{flowers were}} dead and gone, yellow leaves lay {{rustling}} on the ground, bleak winds went whistling through the naked trees, and cold, white Winter snow fell softly down; yet now, when all without looked dark and dreary, on little Annie's breast the fairy flower bloomed {{more beautiful than}} ever. The memory of her forest dream had never passed away, and through trial and temptation she had been true, and kept her resolution still unbroken; seldom now did the <b>warning</b> <b>bell</b> sound in her ear, and seldom did the flower's fragrance cease to float about her, or the fairy light to brighten all whereon it fell.|$|E
60|$|A {{long stretch}} of smooth level road now lay before them. It {{required}} the merest touch on the treadles to send them skimming along like skaters on smooth ice, or swallows flying low. Like gentle ghosts they fleeted along {{with little more than}} a muffled sound, for their axles turned in ball-sockets and their <b>warning</b> <b>bells</b> were silent save when touched.|$|R
5000|$|When lexical scoping is used {{to infer}} , the use of [...] in code, while not illegal, may raise <b>warning</b> <b>bells</b> to a {{maintenance}} programmer, although there are still legitimate uses of [...] in this case, such as referring to instance variables hidden by local variables of the same name, or if the method wants to return {{a reference to the}} current object, i.e. , itself.|$|R
5000|$|These are {{foreground}} sounds, {{which are}} listened to consciously; examples would be <b>warning</b> devices, <b>bells,</b> whistles, horns, sirens, etc.|$|R
60|$|There are differences, however. After you had left, I {{stood and}} sympathised with those around me, and {{observed}} {{that there is}} usually more emotion on a wharf than on a platform--naturally enough, as, {{in the case of}} long sea voyages, partings, it may be presumed, are for longer periods, and dangers are supposed to be greater and more numerous than in land journeys,--though this is open to question. The waiting process, too, is prolonged. Even after the <b>warning</b> <b>bell</b> had sent non-voyagers ashore, they had to stand for a considerable time in the rain while we cast off our moorings or went through some of those incomprehensible processes by which a leviathan steamer is moved out of dock.|$|E
60|$|Then {{followed}} another rush of {{the populace}} for the evening meal of the live stock, but in this Dolores was too wary to share. She made her way up to her retreat again, and tried to lose the sense of her trouble and loneliness in a book. Then came the <b>warning</b> <b>bell,</b> and a prodigious scuffling, racing and chasing, accompanied by yells as of terror and roars as of victory, all cut short by the growls of Mrs. Halfpenny. Everything then subsided. The world was dressing; Dolores dressed too, feeling hurt and forlorn at no one's coming to help her, and yet worried when Mysie arrived with orders from Mrs. Halfpenny {{to come to her}} to have her sash tied.|$|E
6000|$|... "He! Oh no!" [...] {{returned}} Rupert with {{a slight}} look of astonishment, and the same general suggestion of patronizing his progenitor that he had previously shown to his younger brother. [...] "You needn't mind HIM." [...] In reality Filgee pere, a widower of two years' standing, had tacitly allowed the discipline of his family to devolve upon Rupert. Remembering this, the master could only say, [...] "Very well," [...] and good-naturedly dismiss the pupil to his seat and the subject from his mind. The last laggard had just slipped in, the master had glanced over the occupied benches with his hand upon his <b>warning</b> <b>bell,</b> {{when there was a}} quick step on the gravel, a flutter of skirts like the sound of alighting birds, and a young woman lightly entered.|$|E
2500|$|After Erdoğan {{said that}} the march was only being allowed as a {{government}} favor, former AKP official Abdüllatif Şener {{said that the}} comment [...] "should ring <b>warning</b> <b>bells</b> for democracy," [...] adding that it [...] "comes to mean {{that you can do}} nothing if we (the government) do not want you to." [...] Some commentators at the pro-government Daily Sabah newspaper have written that the march [...] "is an attempt to release some pressure emerging from intra-party dissident voices".|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, some lightships were fitted with <b>warning</b> <b>bells,</b> either {{mounted on the}} {{structure}} or lowered into the water, the purpose of which was to warn of danger in poor visibility and to permit crude estimation of the lightship relative to the approaching vessel. Tests conducted by Trinity House found that sound from a bell submerged some 18 ft could be heard {{at a distance of}} 15 mi, with a practical range in operational conditions of 1-3 miles.|$|R
50|$|If {{exploration}} derived prognosed depths {{are significantly}} different from the Driller's Depths, for example by 10−30 m, then <b>warning</b> <b>bells</b> come up - it is possible a pipe section or stand has been left off the calculations. If this is suspected, then the drill string should be measured (in tension) when the string is next pulled out of the hole, and the results checked with the tally. Mudloggers should be vigilant, as they provide the opportunity to cross check with the drilling company.|$|R
60|$|At length {{the light}} began to fade, {{and for that}} day their {{experiments}} were over. In token of their conclusion twice Stella rang the electric <b>warning</b> <b>bell</b> which {{was attached to the}} aerophone, and in some mysterious manner caused the bell of its twin instrument to ring also. Then she packed the apparatus in its box, for, with its batteries, it was too heavy and too delicate to be carried conveniently, locking it up, and left the church, which she also locked behind her. Outside it was still snowing fast, but softly, for the wind had dropped, and a sharp frost was setting in, causing the fallen snow to scrunch beneath her feet. About half-way along the bleak line of deserted cliff which stretched from the Dead Church to the first houses of Monksland, she saw the figure of a man walking swiftly towards her, and knew from the bent head and broad, slightly stooping shoulders that it was Morris coming to escort her home. Presently they met.|$|E
60|$|They had, however, talked {{longer than}} usual, and the {{notes of the}} <b>warning</b> <b>bell</b> came up, just when Gillian had many more {{questions}} to ask, {{and she had to}} run down the garden all in a glow with eagerness and excitement, so that Aunt Ada asked if she had been standing in the sea wind. Her affirmative was true enough, and yet she was almost ashamed of it, as not the whole truth, and there was a consciousness about her all the afternoon which made her soon regret that conversation was chiefly absorbed by the younger one's lamentations that they were not to accompany her to Silverfold, and by their commissions. Fergus wanted a formidable amount of precious tools, and inchoate machines, which Mrs. Halfpenny had regarded as 'mess,' and utterly refused to let his aunts be 'fashed' with; while Valetta's orders were chiefly for the visiting all the creatures, so as to bring an exact account of the health and spirits of Rigdum Funnidos, etc., also for some favourite story-books which she wished to lend to Kitty Varley and Maura White.|$|E
60|$|I saw {{him last}} in the hour of those {{tremendous}} adieux which were paid him in New York before he sailed to be minister in Germany. It {{was one of the}} most graceful things done by President Hayes, who, most of all our Presidents after Lincoln, honored himself in honoring literature by his appointments, to give that place to Bayard Taylor. There was no one more fit for it, and it was peculiarly fit that he should be so distinguished to a people who knew and valued his scholarship and the service he had done German letters. He was as happy in it, apparently, as a man could be in anything here below, and he enjoyed to the last drop the many cups of kindness pressed to his lips in parting; though I believe these farewells, at a time when he was already fagged with work and excitement, were notably harmful to him, and helped to hasten his end. Some of us who were near of friendship went down to see him off when he sailed, as the dismal and futile wont of friends is; and I recall the kind, great fellow standing in the cabin, amid those sad flowers that heaped the tables, saying good-by to one after another, and smiling fondly, smiling wearily, upon all. There was champagne, of course, and an odious hilarity, without meaning and without remission, till the <b>warning</b> <b>bell</b> chased us ashore, and our brave poet escaped with what was left of his life.|$|E
30|$|This {{early warning}} of a {{potential}} serious side effect of BPs and other reports {{that emerged in the}} following months (Ruggiero et al. 2004) had to ring <b>warning</b> <b>bells</b> (European-Environment-Agency 2001; Kheifets et al. 2001). However, in the following years, placebo-controlled RCTs that randomized patients to receive BPs therapies or placebo for periodontal treatment proposes (Lane et al. 2005), (Rocha et al. 2004), resulted in a conclusion that “bisphosphonate treatment may be an appropriate adjunctive treatment to preserve periodontal bone mass” (Lane et al. 2005).|$|R
50|$|For {{many years}} the theatre {{did not have}} its own {{licensed}} bar, so some of the audience would visit one of the public houses {{either side of the}} theatre before shows and during the interval. In order that these ticket holders did not miss any of the show, the theatre's <b>warning</b> <b>bells</b> before curtain-up and after the interval are relayed to the bars in both public houses. Although the theatre now has its own licence to serve alcohol, this tradition still continues to this day.|$|R
40|$|Can the NHS IT juggernaut be steered onto {{a better}} course? It {{is the largest}} {{civilian}} IT project in the world (Brennan 2005). on a ten year journey starting in 2002. But many <b>warnings</b> <b>bells</b> have been sounding from the medical professionals who will use it (e. g. Medix 2006; Royal College of Nursing 2006). technical experts who have studied it (e. g.
