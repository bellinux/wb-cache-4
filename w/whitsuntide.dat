5|$|A {{number of}} holidays, festivals and other {{celebrations}} play an integral role in Barbadian folk, and popular, music. <b>Whitsuntide,</b> Christmas, and Easter are important, each {{associated with their}} own musical traditions, as are distinctly Barbadian festivities like the crop over festival and the Landship movement.|$|E
5|$|A chapel {{dedicated}} to St Catherine of Alexandria {{is known to}} have existed on the site since 1157, when the Prior of Durham agreed to allow Romanus de Hilton to appoint his own chaplain for the chapel, subject to the prior's approval. In return, de Hilton was to provide an annual contribution of 24sheaves of oats for every draught ox he owned, to the nearby monastery at Monkwearmouth, and was required to attend the mother church of St Peters for the feasts of the Nativity, Easter, <b>Whitsuntide</b> and Saints Peter and Paul. In 1322, there was a chantry {{dedicated to}} the Virgin Mary and there were three chantry priests in 1370.|$|E
5|$|The pope {{referred}} {{the dispute}} to a council of English prelates, which met at Windsor during <b>Whitsuntide</b> in 1072. The council {{decided that the}} Archbishop of Canterbury was the superior of the Archbishop of York and further ruled that York had no rights south of the Humber River. This meant that the disputed bishoprics {{were taken from the}} province of York, an outcome that probably had the support of the King, who aimed to prevent the separation of the north from the rest of England. By depriving the Archbishop of suffragans, William limited York's power and separatist tendencies. The medieval chronicler Hugh the Chanter commented that by requiring Thomas to obey Canterbury, the King removed the threat that Thomas might crown someone else as King of England– such as the Danish king. However, the council of Windsor also ruled that York's province included Scotland. Although Thomas was required to profess obedience to Lanfranc and Lanfranc's successors, the obedience did not mention nor was held to acknowledge any primacy of Canterbury, and it did not bind Thomas' successors.|$|E
5|$|Windsor was not {{initially}} {{used as a}} royal residence; the early Norman kings preferred to use the former palace of Edward the Confessor {{in the village of}} Old Windsor. The first king to use Windsor Castle as a residence was Henry I, who celebrated <b>Whitsuntide</b> at the castle in 1110 during a period of heightened insecurity. Henry's marriage to Adela, the daughter of Godfrey of Louvain, took place in the castle in 1121. During this period the keep suffered a substantial collapse– archaeological evidence shows that the southern side of the motte subsided by over 6ft (2m). Timber piles were driven in to support the motte and the old wooden keep was replaced with a new stone shell keep, with a probable gateway to the north-east and a new stone well. A chemise, or low protective wall, was subsequently added to the keep.|$|E
5|$|The three Kings of Arms {{have also}} been {{entitled}} to wear a crown since the 13th century. However, {{it was not until}} much later that the specific design of the crown was regulated. The silver-gilt crown is composed of sixteen acanthus leaves alternating in height, inscribed with a line from Psalm 51 in Latin: Miserere mei Deus secundum magnam misericordiam tuam (translated: Have mercy on me O God according to Thy great mercy). Within the crown is a cap of crimson velvet, lined with ermine, having at the top a large tuft of tassels, wrought in gold. In medieval times the king of arms were required to wear their crowns and attend to the Sovereign on four high feasts of the year: Christmas, Easter, <b>Whitsuntide</b> and All Saint's Day. Today, the crown is reserved for the most solemn of occasions. The last time these crowns were worn was at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. At other times, kings of arms wear a black bicorne trimmed with white ostrich feathers when performing duties outdoors, or a black velvet cap, depending on circumstances of occasion.|$|E
25|$|The Chippenham Folk Festival {{takes place}} every year, usually over the <b>Whitsuntide</b> weekend.|$|E
25|$|In {{the match}} played over the <b>Whitsuntide</b> bank holiday in June 1924 Lancashire were skittled for just 74 {{in their second}} innings, leaving Yorkshire a target of just 58 the next day. Despite opening with Percy Holmes and Herbert Sutcliffe Yorkshire were {{dispatched}} for just 33 by Cecil Parkin and Dick Tyldesley, Lancashire's first win in Yorkshire for 25 years.|$|E
25|$|A {{description}} of the institution and character of the Ascensiontide rogations is given by Sidonius Apollinaris. The solemnity of these, he says, was first established by Mamertus. Hitherto they had been erratic, lukewarm, and poorly attended (vagae, tepentes, infrequentesque). Those he instituted were characterized by fasting, prayers, psalms, and tears. In the Ambrosian rite the rogations take place after Ascension, and in the Spanish on the Thursday to Saturday after <b>Whitsuntide,</b> and in November (Synod of Girona, 517).|$|E
25|$|The New English Bible was {{produced}} primarily by British and European scholarship (for example, <b>Whitsuntide</b> is rendered in 1 Corinthians 16:8 rather than Pentecost). However, directly following the Second World War the English of the United Kingdom and Europe {{began to be}} influenced by foreign idiom, especially that of the Americans. For this reason, passages found in the New English Bible could be understood by a large body of English speaking individuals. The British publisher and author Adam Nicolson, in his 2003 book on the King James Bible, criticized the newer translation for its 'anxiety not to bore or intimidate'.|$|E
25|$|The Lutheran {{practice}} has varied {{at different times}} and in different countries. Thus, according to the Württemberg Kirchenordnung of 1553, a funeral procession was prescribed, the bier being followed by the congregation singing hymns; the Brandenburg Kirchenordnung (1540) directed a cross-bearer to precede the procession and lighted candles to be carried, and this was prescribed also by the Waldeck Kirchenordnung of 1556. At present funeral processions survive in general only in the country districts; the processional cross or crucifix is still carried. In some provinces also the Lutheran Church has retained the ancient rogation processions in the week before <b>Whitsuntide</b> and, in some cases, {{in the month of}} May or on special occasions (e.g. days of humiliation, Busstage), processions about the fields to ask a blessing on the crops. On these occasions the ancient litanies are still used.|$|E
25|$|Saddleworth has a {{large number}} of annual customs and traditions, many of which are held during <b>Whitsuntide.</b> On Whit Friday morning, congregations from the churches of all of the Saddleworth villages hold their Walk of Witness and congregate in Uppermill {{to take part in a}} {{religious}} service. Later in the evening, the Whit Friday brass band contests take place. The band contests originated in Saddleworth and the nearby towns of Mossley and Stalybridge in 1884 and are still centred on the local area. The first band to win in Uppermill was the Wyke Temperance Band. Bands from around the country, and indeed the world, travel to the area annually to compete. Due to the huge popularity of the event, Whit Friday band contests are now held in others of Saddleworth's surrounding villages. In the village of Dobcross a Henry Livings memorial prize is open to bands who play on any of the morning's walks on Whit Friday.|$|E
500|$|The {{extension}} of the railway from Worcester to Malvern Link was completed on 25 May 1859. The following year, [...] "Besides middle class visitors... the railway also brought working class excursionists from the Black Country with dramatic effect... At <b>Whitsuntide...</b> 10,000 came from the Black Country to the newly opened stations at Great Malvern and Malvern Wells. Throughout June to September, day trips were frequent, causing the [...] "town to be crowded with 'the most curious specimens of the British shopkeeper and artisan on an outing' [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Much of Joseph's {{compositional}} oeuvre {{was never}} published {{and has been}} lost. Of her published works, two early short orchestral pieces, Morris Dance and Bergamask won considerable critical praise, although neither {{became part of the}} general orchestral repertory. [...] Two choral works, A Festival Venite and A Hymn for <b>Whitsuntide</b> were admired during her lifetime, but seldom performed thereafter. Her carol [...] "A Little Childe There is Ibore" [...] was thought by Holst to be among the best of its kind. In the eight decades after her death there were no commercial recordings of Joseph's music, but there have been occasional broadcast performances.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} history of the {{railways}} accidents were not uncommon, and the ELR was no exception. [...] Several incidents were reported in The Times. During <b>Whitsuntide</b> 1849, a passenger train was in a rear-end collision with an excursion train near Burnley, Lancashire. Despite efforts to protect the rear of the passenger train, another excursion train was in a rear-end collision with it. In January 1850, three people died when a luggage train ran into a passenger train at Maghull railway station. [...] A serious accident occurred at Clifton Junction on 19 October 1851 when a passenger train derailed passing the points on the junction, injuring several passengers, some seriously. [...] In September 1866 a man died after jumping from the train from Blackburn. [...] A non-fatal collision occurred at Lostock Hall railway station in November 1876.|$|E
500|$|The {{religious}} {{music of}} the Barbadian Christian churches {{plays an important role}} in Barbadian musical identity, especially in urban areas. Many distinctive Barbadian musical and other cultural traditions derive from parodies of Anglican church hymns and British military drills. The British military performed drills to both provide security for the island's population, as well as intimidate slaves. [...] Modern Barbadian tea meetings, tuk bands, the Landship tradition and many folk songs come from slaves parodying the practices of white authorities. British-Barbadians used music for cultural and intellectual enrichment and to feel a sense of kinship and connection with the British Isles through the maintenance of British musical forms. Plantation houses featured music as entertainment at balls, dances and other gatherings. For Afro-Barbadians, drum, vocal and dance music was an integral part of everyday life, and songs and performance practices were created for normal, everyday events, as well as special celebrations like <b>Whitsuntide,</b> Christmas, Easter, Landship and Crop Over. These songs remain a part of Barbadian culture and form a rich folk repertoire.|$|E
500|$|Holst was in Venice {{when the}} news of Joseph's death reached him; [...] {{although}} Imogen records that he received it stoically, he was privately devastated. Joseph had, wrote Imogen, [...] "come nearest to his ideal of clear thinking and clear feeling". In his own tribute, Holst drew attention to Joseph's [...] "infinite capacity for taking pains which amounts to genius". No Whitsun festival was held in 1929, but in early July, at an open-air production of Holst's The Golden Goose at Warwick Castle, a special performance of his St Paul's Suite was played in Joseph's memory. On 5 December 1929, at a competitive music festival, Vaughan Williams conducted the choir in Joseph's Hymn for <b>Whitsuntide</b> while the audience stood in tribute. The same hymn was played at the first resumed Whitsun festival, at Chichester in May 1930. In July 1931 Holst included her music in a concert that he conducted at Chichester Cathedral, alongside works by William Byrd, Thomas Weelkes and Vaughan Williams. Over {{the course of the}} next few years Joseph's works were played at concerts and events organised by Morley College, the SWM, SPGS and the English Folk Dance Society. [...] At Eothen a [...] "Jane Joseph Memorial Prize" [...] was established, and music scholarships were endowed in her name at Eothen and SPGS.|$|E
500|$|At Thaxted, Holst became {{friendly}} with the Rev Conrad Noel, {{known as the}} [...] "Red Vicar", who supported the Independent Labour Party and espoused many causes unpopular with conservative opinion. Noel also encouraged the revival of folk-dancing and processionals as part of church ceremonies, innovations which caused controversy among traditionally-minded churchgoers. Holst became an occasional organist and choirmaster at Thaxted Parish Church; he also developed an interest in bell-ringing. He started an annual music festival at <b>Whitsuntide</b> in 1916; students from Morley College and St Paul's Girls' School performed together with local participants. Holst's a cappella carol, [...] "This Have I Done For My True Love", was dedicated to Noel in recognition of {{his interest in the}} ancient origins of religion (the composer always referred to the work as [...] "The Dancing Day"). It received its first performance during the Third Whitsun Festival at Thaxted in May 1918. During that festival, Noel, a staunch supporter of Russia's October Revolution, demanded in a Saturday message during the service {{that there should be a}} greater political commitment from those who participated in the church activities; his claim that several of Holst's pupils (implicitly those from St Paul's Girls' School) were merely [...] "camp followers" [...] caused offence. Holst, anxious to protect his students from being embroiled in ecclesiastical conflict, moved the Whitsun Festival to Dulwich, though he himself continued to help with the Thaxted choir and to play the church organ on occasion.|$|E
500|$|In Joseph's [...] Mirage [...] song {{cycle of}} 1921 (five songs with string quartet accompaniment), a Holstian {{influence}} is evident alongside her own distinctive compositional voice. Gibbs highlights {{the first in}} the cycle, [...] "Song", which initially echoes [...] "To Varuna" [...] from Holst's Rig Veda hymns, but evolves into [...] "a different creation, distinguished by its own uncluttered quartet writing in which the viola has a special part to play". The final song, [...] "Echo", has as much in common with Brahms as with Holst. Joseph's Festival Venite from 1922 is an example of her use of the Modern Dorian mode (an ascending scale from D to the next D on the white piano keys), which became a feature of some of her later works. Scowcroft and Gibbs both point to Tudor influences in the Venite in which also, says Gibbs, [...] "the congenial influence of Vaughan Williams in melody and harmony is felt". The orchestral score for this work lost, but an organ accompaniment has been devised. Joseph's unaccompanied choral Hymn for <b>Whitsuntide</b> [...] also uses the Dorian Mode in what Holst described as a [...] "flawless little motet"; this was first work of Joseph's to be broadcast, in 1968. A Short String Quartet in A minor was performed by the Winifred Smith Quartet in December 1922 and was accepted for publication by J.B. Cramer and Co. However, it was not published, and subsequently disappeared.|$|E
500|$|In November 1921 Joseph {{organised}} the Morley {{forces to}} perform a large-scale pageant, celebrating the bicentenary {{of the church of}} St Martin-in-the-Fields. The text was by Laurence Housman and the music, directed by Holst, was taken from the Morley repertory. In the following year Joseph's increasing recognition as a composer was confirmed when her Seven Two-Part Songs were performed at a SWM concert that included works by Ethel Smyth and other women composers. Two of Joseph's works, A Hymn for <b>Whitsuntide</b> and A Festival Venite were introduced during the 1922 Whitsun festival at All Saints' church, Blackheath, with Holst conducting. After the Venite premiere Joseph wrote appreciatively to Holst: [...] "Do you suppose for one moment that any other conductor takes trouble like that? If you do, you are quite wrong". The Venite was performed on 13 June 1923 at the Queen's Hall, by the Philharmonic Choir under Charles Kennedy Scott; the Spectators critic thought it a [...] "very notable addition to modern British music". Amidst her compositional and other activities, Joseph found time, in 1922, to organise the first Kensington Musical Competition Festival, and to orchestrate many of the competition songs. In due course this festival became an important annual event in Kensington; Vaughan Williams was among the adjudicators. On 12 October 1922, Vaughan Williams's 50th birthday, Joseph organised a choir which gave an early-morning surprise performance in the composer's garden of a song she had written to mark the occasion.|$|E

2500|$|Mortimer fought at the Battle of Falkirk in 1298 when William Wallace {{was finally}} defeated. [...] On 6 February he was created Lord of Chirk.

[...] Chirk pledged allegiance to Edward II, and was with the young King {{when he went to}} negotiate his marriage with Isabella of France. [...] They arrived at Dover on 19 January 1308, and Mortimer left Edward to cross the channel. On 22 May 1306, Mortimer was knighted at Westminster during <b>Whitsuntide,</b> thus his title made him of a suitable rank as an escort to the king.|$|E
2500|$|After {{extensive}} {{work and}} repainting, in September 1965 Barratt sold Darlwyne to Steven Gifford, who took possession and began further adaptations. The sale ultimately fell through, {{and by the}} end of the year the vessel was back in Barratt's ownership. [...] In the spring and early summer of 1966, under the supervision of Barrett's daughter, substantial alterations were undertaken, including the removal of the aft cabin to create an open cockpit area. This change, [...] carried out without professional advice, [...] was never fully completed. During this period the boat was in regular use for trips by members of the Barratt family, including a <b>Whitsuntide</b> voyage across Falmouth Bay to the Helford River, where she apparently performed well in strong winds.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the seventh}} week after Easter (4–10 May 878), around <b>Whitsuntide,</b> Alfred rode to Egbert's Stone east of Selwood {{where he was}} met by [...] "all the people of Somerset and of Wiltshire and of that part of Hampshire which is {{on this side of}} the sea (that is, west of Southampton Water), and they rejoiced to see him". Alfred's {{emergence}} from his marshland stronghold was part of a carefully planned offensive that entailed raising the fyrds of three shires. This meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of ealdormen, royal reeves and king's thegns, who were charged with levying and leading these forces, but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war. Alfred's actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers.|$|E
