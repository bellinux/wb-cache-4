500|$|That {{sense of}} {{crossing}} cultural boundaries was, for Al Kooper, {{at the heart}} of Blonde on Blonde: [...] " [...] was the quintessential New York hipster—what <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> in Nashville? It didn't make any sense whatsoever. But you take those two elements, pour them into a test tube, and it just exploded." [...] For Mike Marqusee, Dylan had succeeded in combining traditional blues material with modernist literary techniques: [...] " [...] took inherited idioms and boosted them into a modernist stratosphere. 'Pledging My Time' and 'Obviously 5 Believers' adhered to blues patterns that were venerable when Dylan first encountered them in the mid-fifties (both begin with the ritual Delta invocation of [...] "early in the mornin"). Yet like 'Visions of Johanna' or 'Memphis Blues Again', these songs are beyond category. They are allusive, repetitive, jaggedly abstract compositions that defy reduction." ...|$|E
500|$|Brown {{had already}} {{completed}} recording sessions for Don't Be Cruel in Los Angeles, California, but felt {{something was missing}} in the record. He said, [...] "I felt my album was lacking a strong, aggressive song and I thought, 'Where better than New York {{to come up with}} it'". He travelled to the city with producer Gene Griffin. [...] "My Prerogative" [...] was written and co-produced by Brown and Griffin. It was recorded at Axis Studios and mixed at Soundworks, in New York. The track was mastered at Future Disc Systems in Hollywood, California. During an interview with The Hour on March 17, 1989, Brown explained the theme behind the song, saying, [...] "A lot of things had been said about Bobby Brown, why <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> this [...] It's my way of expressing to people it's your prerogative to do as you want, but make sure what you do is the right thing". A CD single of remixes by Joe T. Vannelli was released on October 13, 1995.|$|E
2500|$|Game 7 was a {{pitching}} duel between Bob Gibson and Mickey Lolich, pitching on only two days' rest. In a pre-game pep talk, Mayo Smith told his team that Gibson was not Superman, prompting Norm Cash to ask: [...] "What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> {{in a telephone}} booth changing his clothes?" [...] The game was scoreless after six innings, as the two pitchers dominated. In the 7th inning, the Tigers broke through on a triple by Jim Northrup that went over center fielder Curt Flood's head, driving in Norm Cash and Willie Horton. Curt Flood initially misread Northrup's hit, taking a step in, and then slipping as he chased the ball over his head. [...] Flood was tagged a [...] "goat" [...] for having misplayed the ball. The Tigers won Game 7 by a score of 4–1.|$|E

60|$|He instituted {{comparisons}} between her record and his own. He had found fault with her--so he mused--HE! And {{what could he}} say for himself? When she built her first church what <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Gathering other blase multimillionaires into a Poker Club; defiling his own palace with it; losing hundreds of thousands to it at every sitting, and sillily vain of the admiring notoriety it made for him. When she was building her first university, what <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Polluting himself with a gay and dissipated secret life {{in the company of}} other fast bloods, multimillionaires in money and paupers in character. When she was building her first foundling asylum, what <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Alas! When she was projecting her noble Society for the Purifying of the Sex, what <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Ah, what, indeed! When she and the W. C. T. U. and the Woman with the Hatchet, moving with resistless march, were sweeping the fatal bottle from the land, what <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Getting drunk three times a day. When she, builder of a hundred cathedrals, was being gratefully welcomed and blest in papal Rome and decorated with the Golden Rose which she had so honorably earned, what <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Breaking the bank at Monte Carlo.|$|E
60|$|What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> What was any gentleman doing? He wasn't any molly-coddle {{to go to}} bed at ten o'clock! What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> Well--he'd {{been with}} men who didn't shut their doors and turn the boys out just in the shank of the evening. He wasn't any Barker to be wet-nursed by Demorest.|$|E
60|$|What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> He was in {{the very}} act of pouring {{something}} into her glass of wine.|$|E

60|$|The tale {{used to run}} (one {{has heard}} it vaguely in conversation) that the old house at Godalming is haunted by the ghost of Prince Charlie, and one {{naturally}} asks, 'What <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> there?' What <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> there will appear later.|$|R
6000|$|... "An accident!" [...] she repeated. [...] "What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> in my sitting-room? Besides, {{he could}} not have crept {{underneath}} the couch of his own accord." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But he's a queer one--that Captain Hagar!" [...] said Burdette. [...] "What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> on that easterly course? I think he's a scaly customer, that's what I think!" ...|$|E
60|$|What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing?</b> She {{looked over}} his {{shoulder}} upon the paper, and saw figures and signs. When he had jotted down something he went to the telescope again.|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{message was}} intrusted to me," [...] I said. [...] "Of course it was," [...] she answered, [...] "but the bear {{man did not}} know what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not {{understand}} the circumstances." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, where <b>is</b> <b>he?</b> where <b>is</b> <b>he?</b> <b>Do</b> find my poor Tip-Top," [...] said Jamie, crying {{as loud as}} {{he could}} scream. [...] "I'll kill that horrid cat,--I'll kill her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind yourself," [...] {{interposed}} Mrs. Milroy, sharply. [...] "Go on {{with what}} your father said. What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> {{when he was}} talking about Miss Gwilt? How did he look?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Instantly, it {{was only}} a silly lamb in the glass again. And dark, violent hatred of her husband swept up in her. What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing,</b> sitting there gleaming, carried away, soulful? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God bless you! You {{are doing}} what you can for him and for me. But it is too heavy a task. What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> there at all? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyhow," [...] resumed the merciless Mr. Harrison, [...] "I don't see why MAURICE LENNOX didn't get her. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{twice the}} man the other <b>is.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> bad things, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> them.

6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} {{to hear you say}} so," [...] Wrayson declared. [...] "But the {{question}} <b>is,</b> if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not on this business, what the devil <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> here?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, a {{good deal}} that was {{peculiar}} came out to-day," [...] continued Poirot. [...] "Dr. Bauerstein, now, what <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> up and dressed at that hour in the morning? It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the fact." ...|$|E

6000|$|A revulsion of {{contempt}} and disgust came over Gerald's soul. The disgust {{went to the}} very bottom of him, a nausea. Ah, what <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing,</b> to what depths was he letting himself go! As if he cared about her enough to kill her, to have her life on his hands! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The mate didn’t answer. He looked round {{helpless}} like, and see {{the third}} officer swopping glances with the second, and all the men looking sly and amused, and I think if ever a man saw <b>’e</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>’e</b> <b>did</b> at that moment.|$|R
6000|$|Bobby's lack-lustre eyes {{followed}} horse and rider {{down the road}} till they grew smaller and smaller still and finally disappeared in the distance. For a moment he felt puzzled. What was de Marmont doing in this stream of senseless, panic-stricken men? What <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> in the uniform {{of one of the}} Allied nations? Why had he laughed so gaily and appeared so triumphant in his mien? ...|$|E
6000|$|But what <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> here? She put {{the candle}} on the table, and taking her head between her hands {{sat down to}} think.

60|$|It was Stephen's turn to <b>be</b> taken aback. <b>He</b> stood {{regarding}} the Judge curiously, wondering what manner of man <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> {{not know that}} this question had puzzled many before him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know many}} of the men, though I see faces that one used {{to see in the}} High. There is Mr. Yorker, the {{athletic}} man. What <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>doing</b> now?' ...|$|R
