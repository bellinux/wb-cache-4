2500|$|Emperor Taizong asked, [...] "You oppose my {{conducting}} Fengshan. [...] Is it that my accomplishments {{were not}} great enough?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "They are great enough." [...] Emperor Taizong asked, [...] "Is it that my virtues were not great enough?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "They are great enough." [...] Emperor Taizong asked, [...] "Is it that China is not pacified enough?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "It is pacified enough." [...] Emperor Taizong asked, [...] "Is {{it that the}} barbaric nations have not submitted to me?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "They have." [...] Emperor Taizong asked, [...] "Is it that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> good harvests?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "We have had good harvests." [...] Emperor Taizong asked, [...] "Is it that signs of blessings have not occurred?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "They have." [...] Emperor Taizong asked, [...] "Then, {{why is it that}} I still cannot conduct Fengshan?"'Wei responded, [...] "Even though Your Imperial Majesty has accomplished these six areas, we are still inheriting the state left after the great confusion at the end of Sui rule. [...] The population is greatly reduced and has not recovered. [...] The food stores are still empty. [...] When Your Imperial Majesty heads east , the thousands of horses and wagons require supplies everywhere they go, and it is difficult for the local government to do so. [...] In addition, at Fengshan, the rulers and chiefs of the nations should all attend you. [...] However, from the Yi and Luo Rivers [...] to the Sea [...] and Mount Dai , there are still few villages and few people. [...] The weeds grow thickly without end, and this would be inviting barbarians to our abdomen and showing them our weaknesses. [...] Further, even if we greatly reward them, they would not necessarily be pleased, having come from afar. [...] Even if you exempt the people from taxes for many years, you still cannot compensate them for their losses. [...] Why would Your Imperial Majesty want to simply hold a great Fengshan ceremony but receive real detriments?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What?" [...] said Clara, hopping down stairs behind them. [...] "O, about prayers! <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> any in {{the school}} room since Miss Cameron's time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And a {{very good}} thing too," [...] Amuba laughed. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> our bath when <b>we</b> did, <b>we</b> should <b>not</b> <b>have</b> got an {{opportunity}} all day. Now we all feel fresh." ...|$|R
60|$|Do you know, we {{came very}} near sending {{for you this}} winter. If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> news that you were ill too, I almost believe <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> done so, <b>we</b> were so much in trouble.|$|R
60|$|If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> a few moors and heaths {{where he}} could breathe, I don't know whether he could have stayed in England; and as for London, the din, the dinginess, the squalor of houses and people, sat like a weight on his heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{consider}} {{that that is}} the state of the case," [...] remarked Edna. [...] "We have the lake, and so far <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> any Rackbirds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, yet. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> time to count, but not {{far from}} half our number. Macwitty is killed, Bull desperately wounded. Fully half the company {{officers}} are killed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All that blooth means heavy autumn {{work for}} him and his hands. If no blight happens before the setting the apple yield will be such as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> for years." ...|$|E
5000|$|The British {{politician}} Philip Noel-Baker, Baron Noel-Baker, commented {{after the}} war that [...] "The first great defeat for Hitler was the battle of Britain. It {{was a turning point}} in history. If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> the Norwegian fleet of tankers on our side, <b>we</b> should <b>not</b> <b>have</b> had the aviation spirit to put our Hawker Hurricanes and our Spitfires into the sky. Without the Norwegian merchant fleet, Britain and the allies would have lost the war." ...|$|R
60|$|In short, {{as soon as}} {{ever the}} day declined, and the dusk of the evening began to shelter the designs of the men, they dropped away from us one by one; and at last in such numbers, that if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> stayed till the morning, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> fifty men left; out of 1200 horse and dragoons.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} gone very hard with us, for they are splendid skirmishers and, if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> guns with us to effectually prevent them from concentrating anywhere, and had had to depend upon rifle fire alone, I have some doubts whether our little force {{would have been able}} to make its way through the defiles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What we want now is water. We {{drank the}} last drop, {{when we saw}} you coming. We had {{scarcely}} a mouthful each, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> much more during the siege." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh come up, my hero,' {{said one}} of the girls. 'Such a charming riot, and the Prefect himself in the middle of it! <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> such a one in the street this month.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She plays famously," [...] said Gerald; [...] "she, and Agnes, and I, beat all {{the other}} Wortleys one day last summer. Come, Marian, don't say no; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> a game {{for a very long}} time." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{truth is}} that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> very much meaning {{of the sort that}} you stand and deliver, though we were aware of a large, vague wisdom in our words. But we {{perceived}} that our friend had no intention of helping us out, and on the whole we thought it best to temporize.|$|R
5000|$|... "Let me {{take this}} moment to give special thanks to Channel 13, not because I belong to Channel 13, but because Channel 13 {{at the last minute}} covered much of the {{transmission}} with equipment that if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had,</b> <b>we</b> would <b>have</b> had to suspend nearly half the show for reasons everybody knows." [...] Don Francisco ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> deceived the boatman at Pangbourne. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> {{the face}} {{to tell him that}} we were running away from the rain. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> left the boat, and all it contained, in his charge, with {{instructions}} that it was to be ready for us at nine the next morning. If, we saidâ€”if anything unforeseen should happen, preventing our return, we would write to him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! that {{is nothing}} new. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> one fit {{for me to}} use, since the old bay fell lame three years ago. That does not signify at all, for walking with the {{children}} suits me much better.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Yes, it was {{the devil}} himself. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> a {{peaceful}} hour since--not one. The governor has never held up his head from that evening, and now the life has been crushed out {{of him and his}} heart broken, all through this accursed Hudson.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} a time, Major. We must have marched {{thousands}} of miles, and I {{could not say}} how many times we have been engaged. There {{has not been a}} week that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> a fight, and sometimes two or three of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{think he}} was the {{greatest}} directorial talent we've ever had in the [...] theater," [...] Lloyd said of Welles in a 2014 interview. [...] "When you saw a Welles production, you saw the text had been affected, the staging was remarkable, the sets were unusual, music, sound, lighting, a totality of everything. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> such a man in our theater. He {{was the first and}} remains the greatest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, mother, {{you are a}} woman, too!" [...] {{she cried}} exultantly, as they stood up, {{catching}} her mother's hands and standing erect, facing her in the twilight, conscious of a strangely sweet equality between them. [...] "I should never have thought of you in that way if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> this talk. I had to learn that I was a woman {{to know that you}} were one, too." ...|$|R
60|$|Civilization imparts {{itself by}} some such means, {{and the lower}} classes are clothed in the cast conduct of the upper, which {{if it had been}} stored would have left the inferiors rude and barbarous. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> only to think how {{socially}} naked most of us would be if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> the beautiful manners of our exclusive society to put on at each change of fashion when it dropped them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Always," [...] was the answer, [...] "by day, {{and four}} nights out of five. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> so quiet {{a time as}} last night for a week. Now I will go and ask the chief to which {{garrison}} {{you and your brother}} are to be assigned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> {{much time}} to see the fruit yet, but now I must speak to you as your chief. You say you have no thought of {{marriage}} till your apprenticeship is up. That is a good while yet. You may change your mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is very little,' {{returned}} Carker. 'Upon {{the whole}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> our usual good fortune of late, {{but that is}} of little moment to you. At Lloyd's, they give up the Son and Heir for lost. Well, she was insured, from her keel to her masthead.' ...|$|E
60|$|We washed {{ourselves}} in the Rhine at Cologne (<b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> a wash since <b>we</b> <b>had</b> left our happy home in England). We started {{with the idea of}} washing ourselves at the hotel; but on seeing the basin and water and towel provided, I decided not to waste my time playing with them. As well might Hercules have attempted to tidy up the Augean stables with a squirt.|$|R
5000|$|Lewis {{was known}} for his {{constituent}} services. After the closure of the Fruit of the Loom plant in Campbellsville in Taylor County in 1998, Lewis obtained $8.5 million earmarked for Kentucky Route 210. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> that road widened, <b>we</b> would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> secured Amazon.com in Campbellsville" [...] to fill the void in employment, said John Chowning, a Lewis friend and administrator at Campbellsville University. In 2004, Lewis honored the Campbellsville author Betty Jane Gorin-Smith as [...] "historian-laureate" [...] of the Kentucky Heartland region.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} been saying to her, Dickory?" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Do you know {{something}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> heard? <b>Have</b> you been giving her news of her father?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hector," [...] she said, {{as soon as}} she {{was near}} enough for him to hear her, [...] "don't go after the pipe; let us take a {{moonlight}} walk along the shore. I believe it is full moon to-night, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> a walk of that sort for ever so long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{could they}} have {{said that this was}} a good place for fish?" [...] Tompkins said angrily at last. [...] "Why, by this time it would have been hard luck if we had not caught a dozen between us where we usually fish close to the town, and after our long walk <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> even a bite." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to {{hear all}} your adventures. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> much fighting. Niort made but a poor resistance, and Parthenay {{surrendered}} without striking a blow; then I went with the party that occupied Fontenay. The Catholics fought stoutly there, but we were too strong for them. Those three places have given La Rochelle three bulwarks to the north.|$|E
60|$|I {{was then}} under {{contract}} for my Innocents Abroad, but did <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a cent {{to live on}} while I wrote it. So I went to Washington {{to do a little}} journalism. There I met an equally poor friend, William Davidson, who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> a single vice, unless you call it a vice in a Scot to love Scotch. Together we devised the first and original newspaper syndicate, selling two letters a week to twelve newspapers and getting $1 a letter. That $24 a week would have been enough for us--if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> to support the jug.|$|R
60|$|The McGinnis dog {{was sitting}} on the {{back-door}} steps when we arrived. He wagged his tail ingratiatingly, but we ruthlessly pushed him off, went in and shut the door in his face. All the little McGinnises were sitting in a row on their fence, and they whooped derisively. The McGinnis manners are not those which appertain to the caste of Vere de Vere; but we rather like the urchins--there are eight of them--and <b>we</b> would probably <b>have</b> gone over to talk to them if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> the fear of Aunt Susanna before our eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, Jack, don't,' {{interposed}} Bob Sawyer; 'it's {{a capital}} song, but I am afraid <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the other verse. They are very violent people, {{the people of}} the house.' ...|$|R
