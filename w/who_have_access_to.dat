The Library has been criticised for admitting numbers of undergraduate students, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> their own university libraries, to the reading rooms. The Library replied that it has always admitted undergraduates {{as long as they}} have a legitimate personal, work-related or academic research purpose.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{elements}} of the novel that the author found most poignant was that of class division and how there is a subset of people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a world of power and wealth that the vast majority will never experience, of which Gibson cited Brown and his evidently routine use of a private jet as an example. The author felt {{that at the time of}} writing, such social chasms were widening, and drew parallels to the Victorian era as well as to the world of his breakthrough novel Neuromancer (1984) in which there is no middle class, only the super-rich and a predominantly criminal underclass.|$|E

25|$|The {{doctrine}} of individual ministerial responsibility is a constitutional convention adopted from the Westminster constitutional model.

25|$|In earlier years, {{access to}} an {{improved}} water source was 89% and access to improved sanitation was 55% in 2008. Having {{access to an}} improved water source, however, {{is not the same}} as having access to safe water. Many of those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> adequate infrastructure suffer from poor water quality due to fecal contamination; high levels of naturally occurring fluoride, arsenic, or salts; and growing industrial and agricultural chemical pollution. Furthermore, seasonal water shortages occur.|$|E

25|$|Besides being {{a classic}} example of early forest dwellers in west Africa, Kintampo is {{significant}} because there is evidence of a drastic change in food production techniques due to the transition from nomadic hunter-gather lifestyles to life in stationary settlements. This change is known as sedentism and is typical of societies <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to,</b> or are developing systems of agriculture. Ceramic sculptures of humans and animals indicate that the Kintampo settlements were lived at by practitioners of both pastoralism and horticulture.|$|E
25|$|The {{emphasis}} on the oral qualities of traditional story telling are also evident in this short story. The narrator is telling us about his journey, and his anguish during his delirious night. This narration is full of voices, for example as don Chepe and Niña Tina respond to Cuero de Oro's exhortation. Asturias even ends the tale with the final sentence: and the conversation ended. The textual interplay between Cuero de Oro and don Chepe and Niña Tina can also be interpreted as representative {{of a child who}} is searching for the roots of his identity, questioning those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> this knowledge of another (mythical) time and space.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} each season, {{clubs in}} the Bundesliga must apply to the German Football Federation (DFB) for a licence to {{participate}} again the following year; only when the DFB, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> all transfer documents and accounts, are satisfied that there is no threat of insolvency do they give approval. The DFB have a system of fines and points deductions for clubs who flout rules and those who go into the red can only buy a player after selling one for at least the same amount. In addition, no individual is allowed to own more than 49 percent of any Bundesliga club, the only exceptions being VfL Wolfsburg, Bayer Leverkusen and current Regionalliga Nordost member FC Carl Zeiss Jena should they ever be promoted to the Bundesliga as they were each founded as factory teams.|$|E

25|$|The {{cities and}} {{nations that have}} {{invested}} most heavily in car-based transport systems are now the least environmentally sustainable, as measured by per capita fossil fuel use. The social and economic sustainability of car-based transportation engineering has also been questioned. Within the United States, residents of sprawling cities make more frequent and longer car trips, while residents of traditional urban neighbourhoods make a similar number of trips, but travel shorter distances and walk, cycle and use transit more often. It has been calculated that New York residents save $19 billion each year simply by owning fewer cars and driving less than the average American. A less car intensive means of urban transport is carsharing, which is becoming popular in North America and Europe, and according to The Economist, carsharing can reduce car ownership at an estimated rate of one rental car replacing 15 owned vehicles. Car sharing has also begun in the developing world, where traffic and urban density is often worse than in developed countries. Companies like Zoom in India, eHi in China, and Carrot in Mexico, are bringing car-sharing to developing countries {{in an effort to}} reduce car-related pollution, ameliorate traffic, and expand the number of people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> cars.|$|E

500|$|In Diddy Kong Racing, {{players can}} {{choose one of}} eight characters, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> three {{different}} vehicles: car, hovercraft and aeroplane. The car is an all-round vehicle, however it is slowest on surfaces such as sand and water. The hovercraft is designed for both sand and water areas but lacks in acceleration and manoeuvrability. The aeroplane is designed to access aerial areas; it is good at acceleration and manoeuvring, however it has the slowest speed. Each racetrack has a set of boosters known as [...] "zippers" [...] that temporarily boost the player's speed, as well as featuring regenerating balloons of various colours that provide power-ups. There are five different types of balloons: red, blue, green, yellow, and rainbow. Red balloons grant missiles to attack racers ahead, blue balloons grant a speed boost, yellow balloons grant shields to protect the player from attacks, green balloons grant deployable traps to delay other racers, and rainbow balloons grant a magnet ability that brings the player closer to the nearest racer. If multiple balloons of the same colour are picked up, the power-up will be upgraded to a more powerful version. A total of two upgrades are available for each balloon. Additionally, racetracks contain non-regenerating bananas that add to speed when they are picked up. A maximum of ten bananas will improve the speed but can also be obtained to prevent other players from gaining speed. If a racer gets hit, two bananas will be deducted.|$|E

2500|$|The Open Source Movement {{has allowed}} smaller {{businesses}} {{to participate in}} the global economy. Before smaller businesses did not have access to the software needed to participate or compete in the global market. [...] It was the larger corporations, the producers of the networks and software who had the power. “That is, individuals <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the software needed to create, organize, or distribute content can plug into and participate in the global community”. The creation of the Open Source Movement has created “a degree of global computing access that might have been unthinkable in a world where proprietary was the only option.” Individuals or organizations with access to an open source had the means needed to develop technical material for a variety of consumers.

2500|$|According to the Business Insider Intelligence Survey {{conducted}} {{in the last quarter}} of 2014, 39% of the respondents said that security is the biggest concern in adopting Internet of things technology. In particular, as the Internet of things spreads widely, cyber attacks are likely to become an increasingly physical (rather than simply virtual) threat. In a January 2014 article in Forbes, cyber-security columnist Joseph Steinberg listed many Internet-connected appliances that can already [...] "spy on people in their own homes" [...] including televisions, kitchen appliances, cameras, and thermostats. Computer-controlled devices in automobiles such as brakes, engine, locks, hood and trunk releases, horn, heat, and dashboard have been shown to be vulnerable to attackers <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the on-board network. In some cases, vehicle computer systems are Internet-connected, allowing them to be exploited remotely. By 2008 security researchers had shown the ability to remotely control pacemakers without authority. Later hackers demonstrated remote control of insulin pumps and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. David Pogue wrote that some recently published reports about hackers remotely controlling certain functions of automobiles were not as serious as one might otherwise guess because of various mitigating circumstances; such as the bug that allowed the hack having been fixed before the report was published, or that the hack required security researchers having physical access to the car prior to the hack to prepare for it.|$|E
