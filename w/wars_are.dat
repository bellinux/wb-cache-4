5|$|Of {{the four}} early medieval sources {{relevant}} to Thurisind that survive, {{the only one}} providing independent evidence of the king, accounts of Justinian's wars, and {{a detailed account of}} the relations between Gepids and Lombards and their kings is De Bellis (550s), the most important work of Procopius. Considered the greatest historian of the 6th century, Procopius was a Greek writer born in Caesarea in Palestine in 527. The Lombard–Gepid <b>wars</b> <b>are</b> well described in Procopius' work, as the conflict played an important part in the Byzantine plans to invade Italy by a land route.|$|E
