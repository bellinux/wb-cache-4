5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in all subsequent seasons. One feature continued from season one {{was the way the}} show opened: viewers were shown the biggest and most intense physical altercation of the season, and the program then went back to a time before it happened. This fight usually gives you an idea of <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house.

Soon after this, Cecil and Rydia meet Tellah, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to Damcyan Castle to retrieve his eloping daughter, Anna. However, Anna is killed when the Red Wings bomb the castle.

5|$|The Tamil text Sri Venkatachala Mahatyam relates Maya Sita to Vedavati, but {{her next}} birth is Padmavati, not Draupadi. After Ravana tries to molest Vedavati, she curses {{him that she}} would destroy his clan. She seeks the {{protection}} of Agni. Agni consoles her and gives her not only shelter but also {{the opportunity to take}} her vengeance. He disguises Vedavati as Sita, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be kidnapped by Ravana and hides the real Sita in his refuge. At the time of Agni Pariksha, Vedavati enters the fire and Agni accompanies Sita and Vedavati out in public. Rama is perplexed seeing the two Sitas. The real Sita informs Rama that Vedavati was abducted in her place and suffered the incarceration in Lanka. She demands Rama to marry Vedavati, however Rama refuses citing his vow to have only one wife in this birth. He promises that in Kali yuga (the present and final age), when he appear on earth as Venkateshwara, Vedavati will be born as Padmavati, whom he will marry. Unlike Sanskrit texts, Agni plans the whole thing and Sita conspires with him to protect herself, but also safeguards the surrogate Sita's interests.|$|E

25|$|In a {{religious}} context, the word fatwa carries more meaning. This is because when a Muslim {{has a question}} {{that they need to}} be answered from an Islamic point of view, they ask an Islamic scholar this question, and the answer is known as a fatwa. This fatwa is said by followers to carry more weight than just the random opinion of any person. Muslim scholars are expected to give their fatwa based on religious scripture, not just their personal opinions. Therefore, their fatwa is sometimes regarded as {{a religious}} ruling. Here is an example of a fatwa: Muslims are expected to pray five times every day at specific times during the day. A person <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be on a 12-hour flight may not be able to perform their prayers on time. So they might ask a Muslim scholar for a fatwa on what is the appropriate thing to do, or they might look up the answer in a book or on the internet. The scholar might advise them to perform the prayer to the best of their ability on the plane, or to delay their prayer until they land, for example. And they would support their opinion with scripture. The fatwa is not legally binding or final, it is a respected interpretation of the sharia given by a mufti on a particular case. If the individual doesn't like the fatwa given, he/she can seek out another Mufti or Qadi for a second opinion which might have the desired outcome.|$|E

The foreword is written by Tom Brokaw. Barbree's book attempts to illustrate how the media has changed in their coverage of the space programs, from the early enthusiasm to the relative disinterest in the program today. Barbree says he wrote the book because as he looked back over his career, when recalling all the people he'd worked with, very few were left.
