25|$|On December 23, the Toronto Globe and Mail {{reported}} that the Phoenix Coyotes team is receiving financial assistance from the league {{in the form of}} advances on league revenues. The Coyotes have pledged all of their assets to New York company SOF Investments LP to cover an estimated debt of $80 million. The team has lost an estimated $200 million since 2001 and may lose $30 million this season. One of the team's owners, Jerry Moyes' principal source of revenue, Swift Transportation is also in financial difficulty. ESPN {{reported that}} the league has gotten involved with the operations of the Coyotes and their revenues. The NHL reportedly wants to work with the city of Glendale, Arizona, which owns the arena and receives revenues from the team. ESPN also reported that Moyes <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> his share of the team and that Hollywood film producer Jerry Bruckheimer is a possible interested purchaser.|$|E

Meanwhile, he reads the {{newspaper}} in hope that his stock has gone up, but it has in fact fallen in value. The next day, Kramer (Michael Richards) tells Jerry that his stock has fallen again. Jerry calls George to get advice from Wilkinson, the man who gave the stock tip in the first place, but no one can find him. George rings him back and tells Jerry that Wilkinson is in the hospital. While visiting the dry cleaner, Jerry tells George that he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> his stock, but George insists that the tip is good and they should keep the stock. Eventually, George says he will go and visit Wilkinson {{to find out what they}} should do, despite the fact that George does not know him personally.|$|E

2500|$|This is {{generally}} done {{by using a}} physical representation of a trader's intentions with his hands. [...] If a trader wants to buy ten contracts at a price of eight, for example, in the pit he would yell [...] "8 for 10", stating price before quantity, and turn his palm inward toward his face, putting his index finger to his forehead denoting ten; {{if he were to}} be buying one, he would place his index finger on his chin. [...] If the trader <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> five contracts at a price of eight, they would yell [...] "5 at 8", stating quantity before price, and show one hand with palm facing outward, showing 5 fingers. [...] The combination of hand-signals and vocal representation between the way a trader expresses bids and offers is a protection against misinterpretation by other market participants. For historical purposes, an illustrated project to record the hand signal language used in CBOT's trading pits has been compiled and published.|$|E

2500|$|On January 16, 2009, Citigroup {{announced}} {{its intention to}} reorganize itself into two operating units: Citicorp for its retail and institutional client business, and Citi Holdings for its brokerage and asset management. Citigroup will continue to operate as a single company for the time being, but Citi Holdings managers will be tasked to [...] "take advantage of value-enhancing disposition and combination opportunities as they emerge", and eventual spin-offs or mergers involving either operating unit were not ruled out. Citi Holdings consists of Citi businesses that Citi <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> and are not considered part of Citi's core businesses. The majority of its assets are U.S. mortgages. It {{was created in the}} wake of the financial crisis as part of Citi's restructuring plan. It consists of several business entities including remaining interests in local consumer lending such as OneMain Financial, divestitures such as Smith Barney, and a special asset pool. Citi Holdings represents $156 billion of GAAP assets, or ~8% of Citigroup; 59% represents North American mortgages, 18% operating businesses, 13% special asset pool, and 10% categorized as other. Operating businesses include OneMain Financial ($10B), PrimeRe ($7B), MSSB JV ($8B) and Spain / Greece retail ($4B), less associated loan loss reserves.
