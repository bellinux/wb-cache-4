40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review was to {{provide an overview of}} the available effective interventions that enhance work participation of people with a chronic disease, irrespective of their diagnosis. A search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library, searching for {{systematic review}}s published between 2004 and February 2015. Systematic reviews were eligible for inclusion if they described an intervention aimed at enhancing work participation and included participants of working age (18 - 65  years) with a chronic disease. Reviews had to include populations having different chronic diseases. The quality of the included reviews was evaluated using the quality instrument AMSTAR. Results of reviews of medium and high quality were described in this review. The search resulted in 9 reviews, 5 of <b>which</b> <b>were</b> <b>of</b> <b>medium</b> quality. No high quality reviews were retrieved. 1 review reported inconclusive evidence for policy-based return to work initiatives. The 4 other reviews described interventions focused on changes at work, such as changes in work organisation, working conditions and work environment. Of these 4 reviews, 3 reported beneficial effects of the intervention on work participation. Interventions examined in populations having different chronic diseases were mainly focused on changes at work. The majority of the included interventions were reported to be effective in enhancing work participation of people with a chronic disease, indicating that interventions directed at work could be considered for a generic approach in order to enhance work participation in various chronic disease...|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{pressures}} are driving automotive manufacturers towards light weight cost efficient structures. Composite materials {{have been shown}} to display high specific energy absorption levels thus offering opportunities for mass reduction over conventional steel structures. Whilst composites display these specific advantages, the mechanisms by <b>which</b> energy <b>is</b> absorbed are more complex and are preventing widespread acceptance of composite structures. This work aims to further scientific understanding of the crushing process and provide realistic data {{for a wide range of}} processing conditions and commonly used materials. The main objectives <b>of</b> this study <b>were</b> to quantify the effect of industrial manufacturing conditions on the crush performance of composite structures, and to correlate the performance to a number of in-plane laminate properties. The manufacturing parameters considered are constituent material related (mould temperature, post-cure time and resin composition), interlaminar toughness related and process related (amount of binder and voidage). The work presented in the thesis reports the results of axial crushing experiments, in-plane and inter-laminar testing performed on composite parts made from glass reinforced polyester and vinylester resins. The preforms were made from 2 fabrics; a continuous filament random mat and a 0 / 90 ° non crimp fabric. All parts were produced by resin transfer moulding (RTM) under conditions <b>which</b> <b>were</b> representative <b>of</b> <b>medium</b> volume industrial processing. Constituent material results demonstrate clear advantages associated with the use of vinylester resin and that while relationships between all in-plane properties and the crush performance can be observed, the ultimate compressive stress is the most reliable indicator of this performance. Interlaminar toughness enhancement shows great promise for tailoring of the crush curve and increase in energy absorption of non-crimp fabrics. Results for the processing work are directly applicable to existing manufacturing and demonstrate the potential for real reductions in cycle time and increase in properties.

Both Rodessa limestone and sandstone have been altered significantly by diagenetic processes that include micritization, cementation, dissolution, neomorphism and compaction. Dissolution is the main factor that resulted in enhanced porosity and permeability while cementation adversely affected porosity.

I focus on the role of Pest-Buda in the professions of female writers, editors and actresses. Therefore, the subjects of the three case studies <b>are</b> the representatives <b>of</b> these professions: Júlia Szendrey (1828 - 1868) as poet, writer and translator, Emília Kánya (1828 - 1905) as the first female editor of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and Kornélia Prielle (1826 - 1906) as successful actress who experienced significant alterations in the assessment of her profession. My main research questions are the following: What <b>was</b> the role <b>of</b> the countryside and Pest-Buda in the female intellectual careers in the 19 th century? How did the intellectual women use the urban space in Pest-Buda? What <b>was</b> the role <b>of</b> the first female intellectual professions (writer, editor, and actress) in the urban society? The main sources <b>of</b> the research <b>are</b> the so-called ego-documents (autobiographies, memoires, diaries, correspondences) as well as press products <b>which</b> <b>were</b> <b>mediums</b> <b>of</b> the contemporary debates about the female roles and professions. My primary goal is to reconsider the questions about the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to explore {{some of the}} reasons why teachers shift codes in an ESL classroom by using Goffman’s (1981) concept of footing. In English as a Second Language (ESL) classrooms, especially in the rural areas in Sarawak, Malaysian pupils of different levels of proficiency in the target language – English- are placed in the same class. When this happens the ESL teacher has to shift from code to code several times within the same lesson when communicating with pupils having different levels of proficiency in English. This shift in codes helps the teacher get responses from the students. In this paper we demonstrate this change in footing by an ESL teacher during a Reading Comprehension lesson. The reading teacher shifted from English to the national language, Malay <b>which</b> <b>is</b> the <b>medium</b> <b>of</b> instruction in Malaysia and even shifted to Bidayuh (the mother tongue of most of the students) with the objective of facilitating understanding of the text. Both the teacher and the pupils in this case study are Bidayuhs. We contend that if rural pupils find it difficult to understand English then the ESL teacher MUST at times shift codes to facilitate understanding. This should be an accepted practice so as to encourage low proficiency target language speakers participate actively in the reading classroom...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} some {{chemical}} {{aspects of the}} bile pigment bilirubin have been examined. Bilirubin {{has been shown to}} exist as the bislactam tautomer, with an intranolocularly hydrogen bonded structure <b>which</b> <b>is</b> independent <b>of</b> the <b>medium.</b> Possible structures are discussed in Chapter 2. The clinical determination of bilirubin involves treatment of the pigment with diazotised sulphanilic acid (the van den Bergh reaction) when bilirubin is cleaved at the central methylene bridge to form two azopigments. The fate of the central methylene bridge carbon atom was unknown until the present work, but it had been postulated as being liberated as formaldehyde. In Chapter 3, it is shown that formaldehyde is formed during this reaction, and that it can be detected by the product of its reaction with dimedone. Some metal complexes of bilirubin formed in dipolar aprotic solvents are discussed in Chapter 4. A possible structure for the complex with Zn(II), isolated from DMF solution, is suggested. In Chapter 5, a potentially extremely useful method for the synthesis of bilirubin conjugates <b>of</b> defined structures <b>is</b> examined, using substituted aryl triazenes, under mild conditions. This method allows the esterification of a specific hydroxyl group in a polyhydroxylated mono – or oligosaccaride without protection of the other hydroxyl group present. Thus, in this work, using l – alkyl - 3 -p- tolyltriazenes, the hitherto unknown diethyl, diisopropyl and dibenzyl esters <b>of</b> bilirubin have <b>been</b> prepared and characterised. ...|$|R
