5|$|It {{has been}} two <b>weeks</b> <b>since</b> Sheriff Graham's (Jamie Dornan) death, and the {{citizens}} of Storybrooke continue to mourn. Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) convinces Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) {{she ought to be}} sheriff, but Regina (Lana Parrilla) has already appointed Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito) for the job. Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) suspects Regina is responsible for Graham's death and starts to believe good cannot defeat evil because good plays by the rules. Gold offers Emma his support and reveals to her the town charter which states the Mayor can only choose a candidate for Sheriff and therefore an election must be held. Emma decides to run, so Regina declares Sidney Glass will as well. Henry becomes worried when he finds out Gold is Emma's benefactor, considering how dangerous it is to owe him one favor, let alone two. Regina is furious that Gold would work against her.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of Alienation was hinted at in early January 2014 and {{announced at the}} 2014 Sony Gamescom convention. In 2015, the developers released details of the gameplay and classes and its first trailer. According to Sony, the game would be released sometime in 2015; it was delayed until March 2, 2016. After another three-week delay, it was released {{as part of a}} Sony promotion releasing six games in seven <b>weeks.</b> <b>Since</b> the release of Alienation, Housemarque has updated the game with free and paid expansions. It received positive reviews, with praise for the twin-stick elements and cooperative multiplayer feature. Reviewers criticized the lack of a local co-op mode, which was later added, and the game's lack of variety in regard to weapons and ammunition.|$|E
5|$|The {{timing of}} the {{coronation}} has varied throughout British history. King Edgar's coronation was some 15 years after his accession in 957 {{and may have been}} intended to mark the high point of his reign, or that he reached the age of 30, the age at which Jesus Christ was baptised. HaroldII was crowned on the day {{after the death of his}} predecessor, Edward the Confessor, the rush probably reflecting the contentious nature of Harold's succession; whereas the first Norman monarch, WilliamI, was also crowned on the day he became king, 25December 1066, but three <b>weeks</b> <b>since</b> the surrender of English nobles and bishops at Berkhampstead, allowing time to prepare a spectacular ceremony. Most of his successors were crowned within weeks, or even days, of their accession. EdwardI was fighting in the Ninth Crusade when he acceded to the throne in 1272; he was crowned soon after his return in 1274. EdwardII's coronation, similarly, was delayed by a campaign in Scotland in 1307. HenryVI was only a few months old when he acceded in 1422; he was crowned in 1429, but did not officially assume the reins of government until he was deemed of sufficient age, in 1437. Pre-modern coronations were usually either on a Sunday, the Christian Sabbath, or on a Christian holiday. Edgar's coronation was at Pentecost, WilliamI's on Christmas Day, possibly in imitation of the Byzantine emperors, and John's was on Ascension Day. Elizabeth I consulted her astrologer, John Dee, before deciding on an auspicious date. The coronations of Charles II in 1661 and Anne in 1702 were on St George's Day, the feast of the patron saint of England.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{high rates}} of very early {{miscarriage}} (25% of pregnancies are lost within the first six <b>weeks</b> <b>since</b> the woman's last menstrual period, or LMP), the methods used to detect pregnancy may lead to bias in conception rates. Less-sensitive methods will detect lower conception rates, because they miss the conceptions that resulted in early pregnancy loss. A Chinese study of couples practicing random intercourse to achieve pregnancy used very sensitive pregnancy tests to detect pregnancy. It found a 40% conception rate per cycle over the 12-month study period.|$|E

It was also noted that investigators could not determine whether a head and neck support (HANS) device would have saved Earnhardt's life, and that airline-style black boxes would be mandated for all vehicles in order to better understand the forces at work in a crash such as Earnhardt's.|$|E
