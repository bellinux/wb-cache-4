50|$|The {{music video}} has a {{straightforward}} plot line. It {{begins with a}} title card showing her name and {{the title of the}} song. It later opens up to a scene where a group of people donning colourful clothes is gathering around a table while interacting with each other. In the next scene, it shows Siti sneaking into the house via the front door much to the surprise of the group of people. In the next part of the video, she is shown to be singing and sitting in the middle between two <b>white</b> <b>couches</b> while being accompanied by Pak Ngah Suhaimi who is playing an accordion while both of them are being watched by other guests. In the next scene she is shown standing with her guests in front of a white bungalow that is decorated with decorative LED lights.

6000|$|Then a long low boat came sliding by softly, lighted {{with pale}} blue lamps, {{and on a}} <b>white</b> <b>couch</b> lay [...] "Elaine," [...] the letter in her hand, the golden hair {{streaming}} to her knees, and at her feet the dwarf sorrowfully rowing her down to Camelot. Every one recognized that, for {{the master of the}} revels got it up as no one else could; and Maud laughed to herself as the floating tableau went under the bridge, and she heard people rushing to the other side, waiting eagerly to see the [...] "lily maid" [...] appear and glide away, followed by applause, as one of the prettiest sights seen that night.|$|E
60|$|She did sew. She plied her needle continuously, ceaselessly, but {{her brain}} worked faster than her fingers. Again, and more {{intensely}} than ever, she desired a fixed occupation, {{no matter how}} onerous, how irksome. Her uncle must be once more entreated, but first she would consult Mrs. Pryor. Her head laboured to frame projects as diligently as her hands to plait and stitch the thin texture of the muslin summer dress spread on the little <b>white</b> <b>couch</b> {{at the foot of}} which she sat. Now and then, while thus doubly occupied, a tear would fill her eyes and fall on her busy hands; but this sign of emotion was rare and quickly effaced. The sharp pang passed; the dimness cleared from her vision. She would re-thread her needle, rearrange tuck and trimming, and work on.|$|E
60|$|Nostromo slowly {{crossed the}} large kitchen, all dark {{but for the}} glow of a heap of {{charcoal}} under the heavy mantel of the cooking-range, where water was boiling in an iron pot with a loud bubbling sound. Between the two walls of a narrow staircase a bright light streamed from the sick-room above; and the magnificent Capataz de Cargadores stepping noiselessly in soft leather sandals, bushy whiskered, his muscular neck and bronzed chest bare in the open check shirt, resembled a Mediterranean sailor just come ashore from some wine or fruit-laden felucca. At the top he paused, broad shouldered, narrow hipped and supple, looking at the large bed, like a <b>white</b> <b>couch</b> of state, with a profusion of snowy linen, amongst which the Padrona sat unpropped and bowed, her handsome, black-browed face bent over her chest. A mass of raven hair with only a few white threads in it covered her shoulders; one thick strand fallen forward half veiled her cheek. Perfectly motionless in that pose, expressing physical anxiety and unrest, she turned her eyes alone towards Nostromo.|$|E

50|$|Marclay {{originally}} considered making The Clock as {{a public}} art piece. However, difficulty with lighting and sound made it impractical. Marclay gave museums specifications for the exhibitions' screening rooms. He wanted the video to be projected onto a 21 x 12 foot m screen, {{in a room with}} <b>white</b> IKEA <b>couches.</b> Presenting the piece became a source of friction between Marclay and some museums. The Art Newspaper reported that LACMA's director Michael Govan wanted to project it onto the museum, though LACMA denied suggesting it be projected outside. Marclay disapproved of other screening locations suggested by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Tate. In order to ensure that the full video would be exhibited, he required that museums agree to be open for all 24 hours at some point during its run.|$|R
5000|$|The house {{used for}} Big Brother 5 {{remained}} mostly unchanged {{from the previous}} edition in terms of structure. The house was a one-story building which featured numerous two way mirrors around the walls. Behind these mirrors are numerous camera men, who film the HouseGuests non-stop while they are participating in the game. Aside from these, various cameras and microphones are planted in the house, to catch what is happening at all times. The living room featured two <b>white</b> <b>couches</b> sitting across from each other, with the nominees having their own chairs {{as in the previous}} seasons. These yellow chairs {{were in the middle of}} the couch, and HouseGuests were required to sit here on eviction nights. The bathroom remained unchanged from the previous editions, featuring blue walls with a bathtub and shower. There were a total of four bedrooms this season. One of these had four stone beds in it, with host Julie Chen referring to the room as [...] "pretty bad" [...] in an interview before the premiere. The second had three beds, however, had no privacy. The third featured two large beds, however, required two HouseGuests to sleep in each. This room featured a sky theme, with the walls being painted blue and given the appearance of having clouds on them. The fourth bedroom is the Head of Household room. The HoH for the week has this rooms, which features perks such as privacy, laundry service, and pictures from home. This was the first season in which a spy screen was placed in the Head of Household room, which featured a video feed of various rooms in the house. The house also featured a swimming pool and a hot tub, with HouseGuests competing for the hot tub in the first week. This season saw the removal of the basketball court from the backyard, and the fish tank in the house now features miniature sharks rather than fish.|$|R

Mitch and Cameron let her sleep on their bed while they sleep on the living room floor, but Brenda ends up sleeping on the couch anyway.|$|E
5000|$|The story also {{highlights}} {{images of}} purity. White imagery is introduced {{at the beginning}} of the second section when Calixta unbuttons her white blouse at the neck. When Chopin described the interior of the house for the first time, she describes things like the [...] "white, monumental bed" [...] (Par.13). When the sexual tension is released, the sexualized purity reaches a climax; her neck, exposed by the act of unbuttoning, is white, and her breasts are [...] "whiter"(Par. 25). [...] She is [...] "as <b>white</b> as the <b>couch</b> she lay upon," [...] and her passion is described as a [...] "white flame"(Par. 25). Added to this seemingly paradoxical use of white are the references to the Virgin Mary. While Assumption is a place name, it is also the feast that celebrates the bodily ascension of Mary into heaven, a metaphorical description of what has just happened to Calixta and to further the connection, [...] "her firm, elastic flesh" [...] is compared to a [...] "creamy lily". The lily is Mary's flower.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{examines}} the underlying transitions because they determine {{the stocks of}} the aggregates that are observed. This dynamic approach of relating differences in transition rates to movements of steady-state stocks of labor force aggregates over time was developed by Badgett (1994), Blanchard et al. (1990), and Abraham and Shimer (2001) and was employed to study the unemployment gap between black and <b>white</b> workers by <b>Couch</b> and Fairlie (2010). Decomposing the sample into different race groups, blacks {{were found to be}} the first fired when the economy sours but also the first hired when business cycle conditions are favorable. 2 These findings stand in contrast to conventional predictions based on labor force aggregates that the less-skilled groups were the first fired as business cycle conditions worsen but are the last hired as the economy improves. The findings also demonstrate the importance of examining underlying transitions rather than aggregated data when the interest is in learning about labor market dynamics. This paper contributes to the US immigration literature by applying this dynamic approach of relating underlying monthly transition flows to aggregate unemployment gaps in the immigrant labor market.|$|R
500|$|The Dioscorides {{translator}} {{and editor}} Tess Anne Osbaldeston notes that [...] "For almost two millennia Dioscorides {{was regarded as}} the ultimate authority on plants and medicine", and that he [...] "achieved overwhelming commendation and approval because his writings addressed the many ills of mankind most usefully." [...] To illustrate this, she states that [...] "Dioscorides describes many valuable drugs including aconite, aloes, bitter apple, colchicum, henbane, and squill". The work mentions the painkillers willow (leading ultimately to aspirin, she writes), autumn crocus and opium, which however is also narcotic. Many other substances that Dioscorides describes remain in modern pharmacopoeias as [...] "minor drugs, diluents, flavouring agents, and emollients... ammoniacum, anise, cardamoms, catechu, cinnamon, colocynth, coriander, crocus, dill, fennel, galbanum, gentian, hemlock, hyoscyamus, lavender, linseed, mastic, male fern, marjoram, marshmallow, mezereon, mustard, myrrh, orris (iris), oak galls, olive oil, pennyroyal, pepper, peppermint, poppy, psyllium, rhubarb, rosemary, rue, saffron, sesame, squirting cucumber (elaterium), starch, stavesacre (delphinium), storax, stramonium, sugar, terebinth, thyme, white hellebore, <b>white</b> horehound, and <b>couch</b> grass — the last still used as a demulcent diuretic." [...] She notes that medicines such as wormwood, juniper, ginger, and calamine also remain in use, while [...] "Chinese and Indian physicians continue to use liquorice". She observes that the many drugs listed to reduce the spleen {{may be explained by}} the frequency of malaria in his time. Dioscorides lists drugs for women to cause abortion and to treat urinary tract infection; palliatives for toothache, such as colocynth, and others for intestinal pains; and treatments for skin and eye diseases. As well as these useful substances, she observes that [...] "A few superstitious practices are recorded in De Materia Medica," [...] such as using Echium as an amulet to ward off snakes, or Polemonia (Jacob's ladder) for scorpion stings.|$|R
50|$|The {{fourth season}} has started showing that Hayley is often prone to violent and {{uncontrollable}} mood swings. During puberty, {{she went through}} violent outbursts during every development, such as having to wear tampons (and ruining the family's <b>white</b> <b>couch</b> by sitting on it while wearing a skirt), being disappointed over how small her breasts were when they finished growing, and getting an enormous pimple. These mood swings terrified her parents and they were fearful of the same problems in her brother, although it is shown Steve has had his temper more under control. Another episode revealed that Hayley flies into a rage when men break up with her. It has {{gotten to the point}} where Hayley will have to go to jail if another relationship she has falls apart.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} somewhat haphazardly {{in an effort}} to help the band secure local gigs. While the liner notes state that the album was recorded at [...] "Dirty <b>White</b> <b>Couch</b> Studios", it was actually taped {{in the back of a}} Napa Auto Parts store warehouse in South Bend, Indiana. The first pressing consisted of just 400 CDs and included a spelling error of the band's name on the spine. Regardless, the disc sold out by the first week of September. A second pressing of about 1,000 was ordered, and included a reference to new band member Andy Farag in the liner notes (Farag, however, wouldn't make his actual debut until the subsequent release, Songs for Older Women). Greatest Hits Vol. III is thus known for being the only album to feature the original four-man lineup of the band.|$|E
