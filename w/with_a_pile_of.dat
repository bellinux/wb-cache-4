25|$|A {{variation}} on the log cabin starts with two pieces of fuel wood <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> tinder between them, and small kindling laid {{over the tops of}} the logs, above the tinder. The tinder is lit, and the kindling is allowed to catch fire. When it is burning briskly, it is broken and pushed down into the consumed tinder, and the larger kindling is placed {{over the top of the}} logs. When that is burning well, it is also pushed down. Eventually, a pile of kindling burns between two pieces of fuel wood, and soon the logs catch fire from it.|$|E
25|$|Since {{its initial}} discovery, {{the wreck of}} Titanic has been {{revisited}} on numerous occasions by explorers, scientists, filmmakers, tourists and salvagers, who have recovered thousands of items from the debris field for conservation and public display. The ship's condition has deteriorated significantly over the years, particularly from accidental damage by submersibles but mostly because of an accelerating {{rate of growth of}} iron-eating bacteria on the hull. It has been estimated that within the next 50 years the hull and structure of Titanic will eventually collapse entirely, leaving only the more durable interior fittings of the ship intermingled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> rust on the sea floor.|$|E

In 1874, a large raft got wedged in the chute of the Dunnstown Dam and caused a jam that blocked the channel from bank to bank <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> logs [...] high.

The thing that sold The Ash Man more than anything was the aftermath shot: This half-disintegrated body <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> ash for the head on the ground.

2500|$|In modern times, {{when there}} is no paschal lamb, some Ashkenazi Jews have adopted the {{practice}} of emulating Hillel's example by making a sandwich of matzo and maror (the [...] "bitter herbs": either lettuce, endive, or horseradish). The maror, if lettuce or endive, is dipped in the meal's traditional charoset (a finely chopped sweet mixture of fruits and nuts, typically apples, walnuts, red wine, cinnamon, and honey) just before the sandwich is made. [...] In Ashkenazi families where grated horseradish is used for the maror instead of lettuce or endive, the maror cannot be dipped in the charoset, so it is the custom to spread the bottom piece of matzah with horseradish maror, cover it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pile</b> <b>of</b> charoset, and top it with another piece of matzah to make a hot-sweet sandwich.|$|E
