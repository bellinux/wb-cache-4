40|$|Abstract. Two {{different}} {{specimens of}} hollow composite columns with perforated ribs, {{one is the}} column <b>with</b> double <b>steel</b> skin {{and the other is}} <b>with</b> single <b>steel</b> skin, were designed for imposing axial compression test. The tests indicated that both of the columns have a good bearing capacity and the column <b>with</b> double <b>steel</b> skin has a comparatively better bearing capacity than the one <b>with</b> single <b>steel</b> skin. Then comparisons between tests and finite element analysis (FEA) were preceded, which showed that not only the load-displacement relationship of the columns, but also a reasonable failure mode can be simulated by the finite element analysis...|$|R
5|$|The wood beams {{under the}} glass canopy were {{determined}} to be defective in 2014, and a plan was made to replace them in September 2015 <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> beams.

5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E

5|$|BuroHappold {{has also}} {{completed}} {{the designs of}} a number of cardboard structures, notably the Japan Pavilion for Expo 2000 in Hanover with Shigeru Ban and Frei Otto, consisting of a gridshell of paper tubes (the structure was reinforced <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> in order to comply with fire regulations, though the tubular structure was itself structurally sufficient). The firm has worked with Shigeru Ban on a number of other projects. Another design in cardboard was the Westborough School cardboard classroom in Westcliff.|$|E
5|$|From West Main Street to South Avenue, {{the bridge}} {{supports}} were largely built with concrete while the supports on the section between Brown Street and West Main Street were mostly built <b>with</b> <b>steel.</b> Unlike the concrete supports, the steel supports flexed throughout the year, creating holes and {{gaps in the}} pavement on the deck above. The city of Rochester, which owns and maintains the section of NY31 within the city, closed the outer northbound lane of West Broad Street (westbound NY31) between Brown and Main Streets in June 2008 for this reason.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the {{stations}} on the Sognsvann Line were rebuilt. The platforms were lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains and the platform height was increased. The third rail {{made it impossible}} to cross the line at-grade; an underpass was therefore constructed at Berg station. The station was also redesigned in concrete <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> columns and wooden sheds designed by architect Arne Henriksen.|$|E
50|$|The first European {{references}} to crucible steel {{seem to be}} no earlier than the Post Medieval period. European experiments <b>with</b> “Damascus” <b>steels</b> go back to at least the sixteenth century, {{but it was not}} until the 1790s that laboratory researchers began to work <b>with</b> <b>steels</b> that were specifically known to be Indian/wootz. At this time, Europeans knew of India's ability to make crucible steel from reports brought back by travellers who had observed the process at several places in southern India.|$|R

In the 1940s, he exchanged gut <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> for the first string and {{found it easier to}} play, but reverted to using only gut strings because the steel string altered the sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Texas Giant was {{manufactured by}} Dinn Corporation and designed by Curtis D. Summers. For {{more than a}} decade after its opening in 1990, the Texas Giant remained popular, ranking in the Golden Ticket Awards as the number one wooden roller coaster in 1998 and 1999. However, throughout the 2000s the ride's popularity declined {{as a result of the}} ride becoming rougher. Despite maintenance attempts by the park, Six Flags Over Texas announced the ride's closure in 2009. Much of the original wooden structure was kept, with the track being replaced <b>with</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|E

On 5 March 2011, a motorcycle accident {{on the way home}} from work in Port Macquarie tore off his right leg. It also led to a brain injury. Doctors considered amputating both his arms – his right arm hung by a thread – but managed to save both, which they fastened back together <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> plates. He suffered post-traumatic amnesia, and spent a year in recovery.|$|E
5|$|Two matches aired {{during the}} thirty-minute pre-show. The first {{encounter}} pitted The Naturals (Chase Stevens and Andy Douglas) against Johnny B. Badd and Sonny Siaki. The Naturals won the bout after Stevens bashed Siaki {{over the head}} <b>with</b> <b>steel</b> folding chair and then pinned him. A standard wrestling match between Chris Candido and Cassidy Riley followed. Candido was victorious in the bout by pinning Riley after a diving headbutt {{off the top of}} a padded turnbuckle.|$|E

40|$|The {{participation}} of H 2 O 2 in oxidation of the galena mineral {{and as a}} result in decreasing of the concentrate recovery of galena mineral has not yet been shown. In this study the effect of two types of grinding media in wet and dry grinding on the formation of hydrogen peroxide and galena flotation was investigated. Laboratory stainless steel ball mill (Model 2 VS, CAPCO Test Equipment, Suffolk, UK) was used for grinding galena <b>with</b> mild <b>steel</b> and stainless steel media. Galena ground <b>with</b> mild <b>steel</b> generated more hydrogen peroxide than galena ground <b>with</b> stainless <b>steel</b> media. Galena ground <b>with</b> mild <b>steel</b> has a lower galena recovery than galena ground <b>with</b> stainless <b>steel</b> media. Solutions of 2, 9 -dimethyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline (DMP) were used for estimating H 2 O 2 amount in pulp liquid with DU® Series 700 UV/Vis Scanning Spectrophotometer. This study highlights the necessity of relooking into galvanic interaction mechanisms between the grinding medium and galena in terms of its flotation behavior.
