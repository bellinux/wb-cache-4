5|$|Not much {{is known}} about the life history of hawksbills. Their life history can be divided into three phases, namely the pelagic phase, from {{hatching}} to about 20cm, the benthic phase, when the immature turtles recruit to foraging areas, and the reproductive phase, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> sexual maturity. The pelagic phase possibly lasts until the turtles reach around 20cm in length in 1–3 years, reaching sexual maturity at around 40cm (2–4 years).|$|E
5|$|Ugg and Wrongway – Two purple {{creatures that}} hop {{along the sides}} of the cubes in an Escheresque manner. Starting at either the bottom left or bottom right corner, they keep moving toward the top right or top left side of the pyramid respectively, and fall off the pyramid <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the end.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the {{coordinates}} {{shown on the}} parchments, there is no island in sight. Frustrated, Haddock ponders turning back, but Tintin soon realizes the problem: If Sir Francis had used a French chart instead of an English chart to calculate the position, {{the coordinates}} would have been measured on the Paris Meridian rather than the Greenwich Meridian. As they have been using the Greenwich Meridian, they realise that they are too far west.|$|E

5|$|As they travel, a {{man named}} Baxter (Michael Smiley), who is also unaffected, picks them up. He holds them at gunpoint in a forest, where there are crucified and hanged bodies. As the woman {{is about to be}} tortured, Jem kills Baxter. They {{continue}} traveling to the transmitter, while the woman has visions of past events. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the transmitter, two hunters attack them. The woman wrestles a shotgun away from a hunter and fires at her attacker, but the gun only sprays confetti.|$|E
5|$|Base animals {{selected}} for the two-stage grading up process to any EU herd book purebred class require a minimum of 3/4 Limousin content. Graded up females using the two-stage process then become eligible for entry into the main section of all EU herd book purebred classes as initial registration (or T.I.) Limousins <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> 15/16 Limousin content. They are then legally identified as Limousin (i.e. 100% Limousin) – the breed code 34 often substitutes for the word Limousin in French discussions and reports on cattle breeding.|$|E
5|$|For {{commercial}} use, varieties with {{a minimum}} stem length of 30cm are sought, making them ideal for cut flowers. Florists require blooms that only open <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the retail outlet. For garden plants the objectives are to continually expand the colour palette and to produce hardy forms, {{and there is a}} particular demand for miniature varieties. The cultivars so produced tend to be larger and more robust than the wild types. The main species used in breeding are N. bulbocodium, N. cyclamineus, N. jonquilla, N. poeticus, N. pseudonarcissus, N. serotinus and N. tazetta.|$|E

5|$|The eggs hatch at night, and {{the larvae}} swim {{to the water}} surface where they drift with the ocean currents, preying on zooplankton. This stage {{involves}} three moults and lasts for 15–35 days. After the third moult, the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult, and adopts a benthic lifestyle. The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild, and are poorly known, although they {{are known to be}} capable of digging extensive burrows. It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20,000 survives to the benthic phase. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> a carapace length of , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives.|$|E
5|$|The {{longitudinal}} (or linear) dunes {{were initially}} {{presumed to be}} formed by moderately variable winds that either follow one mean direction or alternate between two different directions. Subsequent observations indicate that the dunes point to the east although climate simulations indicate Titan's surface winds blow toward the west. At less than 1 meter per second, they are not powerful enough to lift and transport surface material. Recent computer simulations indicate that the dunes {{may be the result}} of rare storm winds that happen only every fifteen years when Titan is in equinox. These storms produce strong downdrafts, flowing eastward at up to 10 meters per second <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the surface.|$|E
5|$|A deleted {{scene from}} this episode is {{included}} on the complete thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray Disc sets. It shows the boys taking Michael Jackson (in Ike's body) to the Glendale location of Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks & Mortuaries to prove he is dead. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the grave, Jackson denies it and Kyle attempts to show him by taking a shovel and digging his grave. Stan at first opposes but he, with Cartman and Kenny take shovels and the scene ends with the boys digging Jackson's grave to show he is dead while Ike/Jackson dances. Jackson's grave shows his date of death as July 25, 2009, when in fact he died on June 25.|$|E

5|$|Artyom {{finds the}} Dark One, a child, but is {{captured}} by {{soldiers of the}} Fourth Reich. Pavel Morozov, a captured Red Line soldier, and Artyom escape through the Metro tunnels and across the devastated surface. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the Red Line, however, Pavel is revealed to be a high-ranking officer; he detains Artyom {{to learn more about}} the Rangers and the Dark One. Artyom escapes and races Pavel's forces to locate the Dark One and Anna, who has been kidnapped by Lesnitsky, an ex-Ranger and Red Line spy. En route, he finds a contingent of Red Line forces massacring the inhabitants of a station, supposedly to contain a mysterious epidemic. It was the Red Line that introduced the virus to the station – weaponized Ebola acquired from the D6 vault by Lesnitsky. Artyom finds Anna and frees her but they are exposed to the virus and are quarantined after rescue. Afraid that she will die, Anna seduces Artyom.|$|E
5|$|Cid {{informs the}} group, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> Lindblum, that Kuja is Brahne's arms dealer. Believing {{him to be}} {{from one of the}} other continents, {{normally}} inaccessible by airship, the party travels through a tunnel with Quina to the Outer Continent. There they meet Eiko, discover a village of black mages, and find the Iifa Tree, which produces a fighting-stimulant called Mist. They learn that Kuja uses Mist to create the Black Mages, and Vivi was a prototype. After stopping the Mist creation, the group meets Amarant, hired by Brahne to capture Garnet, who joins them instead. They also learn that Garnet is originally from the same destroyed village as Eiko, and has the power to summon eidolons, which was the reason she was adopted by Brahne. Brahne and Kuja then reach the Iifa Tree, but Brahne attempts to kill him with an eidolon; Kuja instead takes control over it and destroys her and her army instead.|$|E
5|$|Elephants have a fission–fusion {{society in}} which {{multiple}} family groups come together to socialise. Males ("bulls") leave their family groups <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers {{for as long as}} three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.|$|E

5|$|Non-black belts, {{from white}} through to brown, denote the kup ranks. 'Tips' {{denoting}} odd-numbered kup ranks {{are marked by}} a stripe of the higher colour near the right end (from the wearer's point of view) of a belt of the lower colour. Black belts denote the dan ranks. A specific dan rank {{is represented by the}} number of white bars embroidered on the black belt. A black belt with no bars is a Junior Black Belt, a rank assigned to members considered too young (typically 15 years or younger) for 1st dan. Junior Black Belt members are tested for 1st dan <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> 18 years of age. One bar denotes 1st dan, two bars denote 2nd dan, and so on. The end of the belt bearing the dan rank also carries embroidery noting the name of the master issuing the promotion (Chong Chul Rhee, Chong Hyup Rhee, or Chong Yoon Rhee).|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} loop, Crusher again has {{a feeling of}} déjà vu during the poker game, but when Data deals the next hand, all the cards are threes, followed by a hand where all players have three of a kind. The number 3 begins appearing throughout {{other parts of the}} ship's operations while, again, they determine they are stuck in a time loop. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the anomaly and the ship appears from it, Data suddenly realizes that the 3 stands for the number of command pips on Riker's uniform, and executes Riker's option instead of his own. This allows Enterprise to safely clear the oncoming ship. The anomaly disappears and the time loop ends, and the crew realize they have been trapped in the loop for over 17 days, while the other ship, the USS Bozeman, has been missing for over 90 years. Picard welcomes the Bozemans crew to the 24th century.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales {{generally}} {{take several}} breaths before diving {{for a few}} minutes. Feeding dives may last over ten minutes. They are capable of diving to depths of 600 meters, but most dives are {{to a depth of}} 30–60 m. Shallow dives tend to take place during the day, while deeper ones take place at night. When making deep dives, pilot whales often make fast sprints to catch fast-moving prey such as squid. Compared to sperm whales and beaked whales, foraging short-finned pilot whales are more energetic at the same depth. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the end of their dives, pilot whales will sprint, possibly to catch prey, and then make a few buzzes. This is unusual considering deep-diving, breath-holding animals would be expected to swim slowly to conserve oxygen. The animal's high metabolism possibly allows it to sprint at deep depths, which would also give it shorter diving periods than some other marine mammals. This may also be the case for long-finned pilot whales.|$|E

5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of {{windblown sand}} {{piled up in}} mounds or ridges. They form {{downwind}} of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. As the wind blows, saltation and creep {{take place on the}} windward side of the dune and individual grains of sand move uphill. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves slowly {{across the surface of the}} ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E
5|$|Saruman {{makes his}} final {{appearance}} {{at the end of}} the last volume, The Return of the King (1955), after Sauron's defeat. After persuading the Ents to release him from Orthanc, he travels north on foot, apparently reduced to begging. He is accompanied by Wormtongue, whom he beats and curses. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the Shire, Saruman's agents—both Hobbits and Men—have already taken it over and started a destructive process of industrialization. Saruman governs the Shire in secret under the name of Sharkey until the events of chapter 8 ("The Scouring of the Shire") in which Frodo and his companions return and lead a rebellion, defeating the intruders and exposing Saruman's role. Even after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo, Frodo lets him go. When Saruman blames Wormtongue for the damage done to the Shire and curses him, Wormtongue finally snaps and slits his master's throat.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} the Trade Federation's {{blockage}} of the planet Naboo. Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Jedi apprentice Obi-Wan are sent there by the Jedi Council {{as part of a}} mission to officiate the dispute and reach a settlement with the Federation leaders. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>reach</b> the Federation's ship on Naboo, however, they find out that the Federation is not interested in negotiations and has allied with the Sith Lord, who plans to invade Naboo and take control of the galaxy by killing all Jedi. Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are attacked by Federation droids, but manage to escape. They head to Theed, the capital of Naboo, to warn the inhabitants of Naboo about the imminent attack.|$|E
