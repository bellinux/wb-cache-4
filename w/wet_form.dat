50|$|In {{addition}} to their use as anti-cancer drugs, angiogenesis inhibitors are being investigated for their use as anti-obesity agents, as blood vessels in adipose tissue never fully mature, and are thus destroyed by angiogenesis inhibitors.

40|$|Age-related maculopathy (ARM) is {{a common}} progres-sive disease that afflicts the elderly {{population}} worldwide. ARM has been divided into two stages, early and late [1]. Early stage ARM is characterized by drusen, the deposit of extracellular material between the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch’s membrane, and hyperpigmentation or hypopig-mentation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Late stage age-related maculopathy, also called age-related macular degeneration (AMD), {{is one of the}} most common causes of irreversible vision loss in developed countries [2]. AMD is further subdivided into dry and <b>wet</b> <b>forms,</b> which are char-acterized by geographic atrophy of the RPE and choroidal neovascularization, respectively.

50|$|Unlike some diseases, Thiamine {{deficiency}} or beriberi, is a treatable, {{preventable disease}} {{caused by the}} deficiency of vitamin B1. First seen in 1642 by the Dutch physician Jacobus Bontius, it was named for the Cingalese word meaning weakness-weakness. Beriberi is seen in two forms: wet and dry. When in the dry form the patient experience pains in their extremities, paresthesias, paralyses, and contractures due to being a paralytic type of disease. When beriberi is in its <b>wet</b> <b>form</b> the patient can expect swelling of the extremities and face along with an effusion of fluid into their joints, pleural cavity, and pericardial cavity. Beriberi in this form can lead to sudden death.|$|E
5000|$|Collodion process, mostly {{synonymous with}} the [...] "collodion wet plate process", {{requires}} the photographic material to be coated, sensitized, exposed and developed within the span of about fifteen minutes, necessitating a portable darkroom {{for use in the}} field.

50|$|Development of {{the field}} of intraocular drug {{delivery}} In the early 1970, Peyman investigated the blood ocular barrier, using peroxidase as a tracer material, to image the site of the barrier in retina which prevented free diffusion of medication from blood in the eye. Because, at that time, despite the systemic antibiotics many eyes were lost after surgery or trauma due to infection, he initiated the evaluation of direct intra-ocular drug delivery. This method has now become an alternative route of drug administration to the systemic and topical medication that in majority of the cases do not cure the infection. Further investigations lead to the prophylactic or therapeutic intraocular administration of the non-toxic doses of numerous medications in the treatment of inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases of retina in millions of patients. Presently, intraocular drug delivery is accepted and is performed routinely in the treatment of the <b>wet</b> <b>form</b> of age-related macular degeneration and genetic and degenerative diseases of the retina.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of early feed restriction (FR) with wet feeding on size of small intestine, blood lipids and performance parameters in broilers from d 1 to 42. A total of 160 one-day-old male broiler chickens were randomly allocated to 4 treatments with 4 pens per treatment and 10 chickens per pen, in a fully randomized 2  ×  2 factorial arrangement, two feeding arrangement; providing feed ad libitum (Full Fed) or FR by 50 % between days 6 to 12, and feed in either wet or dry form (<b>wet</b> <b>form,</b> 1. 2  g water per 1  g dry feed). Body weight and feed intake of broiler chickens were determined at d 0, 21, and 42, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) was calculated. At d 42, two birds per replicate were euthanised for determination of carcass weight, organ weight and length, and also for blood parameters, which included high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol and triglycerides (TG). The broilers fed <b>wet</b> <b>form</b> irrespective of FR throughout had superior body weight gain and carcass weight compared with birds fed dry diets at d 22 and 42 (P <  0. 05). The <b>wet</b> <b>form</b> with FR significantly showed lower FCR compared with the <b>wet</b> <b>form</b> and ad libitum at d 1 to 21 (P <  0. 05).
