5|$|The {{player can}} protect their vault {{in a number}} of ways, such as {{building}} walls, keeping guard dogs, setting up traps such as electrified floors and bottomless pits, and giving guns to the player's family members so that they can defend the vault as well. The game does not punish the player for family members—by default, a <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> children—being murdered by intruders; the player can even view footage of the incident afterwards. Rather, protecting the money is the goal the game emphasizes. The player starts off with $2,000 in cash and steals more from others' vaults; {{it can be used to}} purchase more objects to defend one's own vault. Additionally, a house is not accessible by thieves when its owner is retooling it for defense.|$|E
5|$|Tilley took {{leave in}} June 1901 {{to return to}} Washington, leaving E. J. Dorn in command. Dorn {{subsequently}} had medical issues {{and was replaced by}} J. L. Jayne in October.
