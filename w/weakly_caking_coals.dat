40|$|During {{the current}} quarter, pilot-scale testing with the {{modified}} air nozzle {{version of the}} PC burner was completed with PRB coal at the Riley Power Inc. (RPI) test facility. A total of 8 different burner configurations were tested utilizing various burner air nozzle arrangements {{in place of the}} burner air channels. It was found that with the arrangements tested, a stable flame could not be maintained at coal feed rates above 100 lb/h. While it is felt that the air nozzle approach can ultimately be used effectively, in the interest of holding to the current project schedule it was decided to proceed with the balance of the project using the air channel design. The pilot-scale PC burner was therefore restored to the air-channel configuration and benchmark testing with PRB coal to confirmed previous operating results. A series of tests was then conducted with PRB and West Virginia <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> to evaluate modifications to the gas combustor configuration and operation for improved performance with <b>caking</b> <b>coal.</b> Continuous operation was achieved with <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> up to 50 lb/h vs. the full load target of 150 lb/h. Impingement and deposition of partially devolatilized coal occurred at various points within the combustor when the <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> feed was increased above 50 lb/h. The 100 MMBtu/h commercial-scale prototype design was continued with coal burner design input from both RPI and VTI. Based on typical burner installation layout considerations, it was decided that the preheat combustor should be oriented horizontally on the axial centerline of the coal burner. Accordingly, the pilot gas combustor was changed to this orientation so that the pilot results with <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> will be directly applicable to the preferred 100 MMBtu design. Testing with <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> in the horizontal pilot combustor achieved feed rates up to 126 lb/h, although some deposition and LOI issues remain. Several promising approaches to further improve operation with <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> were identified. NOx results with <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> are promising, with NOx as low as 150 ppmv at exit oxygen levels of 4 % and higher. The 100 MMBtu/h commercial-scale prototype design is nearing completion. Design of the <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> version of the unit continues with additional pilot testing in support of this design expected. GTI and RPI are expediting the fabrication of the 100 MMBtu/h PRB unit in order to start testing in early- to mid-December.

40|$|The {{primary focus}} for the project during the quarter was {{shakedown}} testing of the large-scale coal preheater prototype in the CBTF with non-caking PRB coal. Additional pilot-scale tests were conducted in the PSCF in support of developing a preheating system design suitable for use with <b>caking</b> <b>coals.</b> Thirty-two additional pilot tests were conducted during the quarter with <b>caking</b> <b>coal.</b> These tests further evaluated {{the use of the}} air-bleed and indirect air-cooled liner designs to reduce or eliminate combustor plugging with <b>caking</b> <b>coal.</b> The air-bleed configurations tested used air injection holes perpendicular to the liner's longitudinal axis with the number, size and air flow though the air-bleed holes varied to determine the effect on combustor plugging. The indirect cooling configurations tested included a stainless steel liner with spiral fins in the annular space between the liner and the combustor wall, and a silicon carbide liner without fins. Continuous pilot operation was maintained for up to 30 minutes at a coal feed rate of 50 lb/h with the air-bleed liner. The best result achieved was for the stainless steel indirect air-cooled liner with 20 minutes of continuous operation at 126 lb/h of coal followed by an additional 20 minutes at 150 lb/h. The NOx results from these continue to indicate that even greater NOx reduction is possible with <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> than with the PRB coal tested. The installation of the large-scale prototype coal preheater for PRB testing in the CBTF was completed and shakedown testing with natural gas and PRB coal started during the quarter.

40|$|International audienceLumps of six {{bituminous}} coals, from 20 to 40 mm in size, were devolatilized in {{a laboratory}} oven in nitrogen atmosphere at different final temperatures ranging from 300 to 800 degrees C. The structure and morphology of the resulting chars with different degree of devolatilization have been examined under an optical microscope {{in order to better}} understand the formation mechanism of different types of char. The swelling of the <b>caking</b> <b>coals</b> and the fissuring of the non-caking coals were characterised by image analysis and some correspondences between the distribution of lithotypes within the initial coal lumps and the char structure obtained were revealed. The relation between chars structure and properties was also investigated. The char lumps obtained from <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> exhibit better resistance to breakage than their parent coal lumps while non-caking coals show the opposite behaviour.

30|$|The {{proximate}} {{analysis of the}} coal samples shows that the Shankodi-Jangwa coal sample had the lowest and acceptable values of volatile matter content (29.69 %) and moisture content (1.33 %) for metallurgical coke production[21, 22]. Likewise, the Shankodi-Jangwa coal sample had the highest fixed carbon content which would translate into more carbon for coke formation[15]. The crucible number of 3.0 for the Shankodi-Jangwa coal sample shows that it can agglomerate on heating to an extent for coking. Even though the cakability index falls {{within the range of}} poor <b>caking</b> <b>coals,</b> the coal is considered to be of some appreciable caking properties which can produce good industrial coke.|$|R
40|$|The {{primary focus}} for the project {{continues}} to be on developing a PC PREHEAT system design suitable for use with <b>caking</b> <b>coals</b> and readying the 100 MMBtu/h CBTF for testing with noncaking PRB coal. During the current quarter, twenty-two pilot tests were conducted with Central Appalachian (CA) <b>caking</b> <b>coal.</b> The objective for these tests was to achieve continuous operation of the pilot system at its design coal feed rate of 156 lb/h, without plugging or agglomeration in the combustor. One combustor air distribution method tested achieved continuous operation at 110 lb/hr, and inspection of the combustor afterward indicated that this method has potential to solve the caking problem. The NOx results from the pilot <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> runs indicate that even greater NOx reduction is possible with CA coal than with the PRB coal tested, to levels near 100 ppmv or lower at 4 - 6 % exit oxygen. It was therefore decided to conduct additional pilot tests of the air distribution method {{to determine how to}} incorporate this into a workable CA combustor design. Based on current weather and manpower restrictions at the site, this pilot testing is expected to be started in February. The design for the 100 MMBtu/h unit for PRB testing in the CBTF was completed and fabrication and installation started during the quarter. While significant {{progress has been made in}} the installation of the unit, weather and combustor fabrication delays are expected to move the start of large-scale testing with PRB coal into February, which will push the project completion date beyond the current 3 / 30 / 04 end date.

40|$|The least {{expensive}} way to produce gas from coal is by low Btu gasification, a {{process by which}} coal is converted to carbon monoxide and hydrogen by reacting it with air and steam.

Standard low Btu fixed bed gasifiers have historically been plagued by three constraints; namely, the production of messy tars and oils, the inability to utilize <b>caking</b> <b>coals,</b> and the inability to accept coal fines.

40|$|<b>Caking</b> <b>coal</b> is {{difficult}} to be gasified in fluidized bed (FB) because of the inevitable particle agglomeration caused by caking in the dense bottom of the bed. Literature {{studies have shown that}} pre-oxidizing the coal can suppress its caking propensity, while quick dispersion of coal particles, for example, by gas jetting in the plastic stage of heating is critical to such a suppression of the caking agglomeration. Thus, the so-called jetting pre-oxidation fluidized bed gasification (JPFBG) is devised in this study to gasify <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> in FB. Coal particles usually below 5 mm are blown into the space above the bottom dense bed surface by an O- 2 -containing gas jet to disperse and meanwhile to pre-oxidize the particles. The resulting char particles with little, even without caking propensity fall into the dense bottom of the bed to allow their gasification there. After validating the destruction of caking agglomeration by jetting pre-oxidation in a laboratory FB apparatus, a 150 kg/h pilot JPFBG plant was built and the <b>coal</b> with the <b>caking</b> index of about 20 was successfully gasified in this plant using normal air and O- 2 -enriched air. The heating vale of the produced gas varied in 2. 9 - 5. 0 MJ/m(N) (3) and decreased with raising the oxygen percentage applied to the jet feeding. Raising the oxygen percentage for the jet caused more of the produced gas formed in the bottom dense bed of char gasification to burn off in the jetting zone. The optimal proportion of the oxygen applied to the jet feeding or coal pre-oxidation was found to be about 37 % against the total oxygen supply. Enriching the 02 content in the gasification agent to about 30 vol. % enhanced greatly the gasification rate of the tested low-reactivity coal in JPFB. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|MSc (Chemistry), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{plasticity}} of coal during pyrolysis is {{of significant}} importance, since {{it affects the}} reactivity, porosity, particle size and {{the density of the}} char and thus also the behaviour of the char during further utilisation processes. The main focus {{of this study was to}} characterize the chemical and physical changes which the thermally treated coal undergoes, in order to better understand the pyrolysis process of caking and non-caking South African coals. The pyrolysis behaviour of three South African <b>coals</b> with different <b>caking</b> indices was investigated. The coal samples included; (1) Highveld (TWD), a medium rank C coal with a free swelling index (FSI) of 0, (2) Grootegeluk (GG), also a medium rank C coal, with a FSI of 6. 5, and (3) Tshikondeni (TSH), a medium rank B coal with the highest FSI of 9. The three coal samples were classified as vitrinite-rich coals consisting of mainly aliphatic structures. Thermogravimetric experiments were used to determine the different temperatures relating to specific percentages of mass loss using set conditions. The pyrolysis process was stopped at various percentages of mass loss (thus at various stages of the reactions) to characterize the chemical structural changes that occurred at the specific mass loss percentages. The results obtained from characterization analyses indicated that the three coals differ in chemical composition and thus were expected to behave differently during pyrolysis. The coal samples consist of different amounts of macerals and minerals according to X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses. The Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFT) results indicated that some of the functional groups within the coal samples evolved with the increase in temperature. The highly <b>caking</b> <b>coal</b> (TSH) exhibited the highest aromaticity and ring condensation. The surface areas were determined by CO 2 adsorption and an increase in surface area was observed with an increase in temperature. The surface area of the GG and TSH coal-derived char samples decreased at some stage, which is an indication of thermoplastic behaviour and subsequent swelling of the coal samples.

40|$|The {{problems}} heretofore with {{coal gasification}} and IGCC concepts have been their high cost and historical poor performance of fixed-bed gasifiers, particularly on <b>caking</b> <b>coals.</b> The Gasification Product Improvement Facility (GPIF) project {{is being developed}} to solve these problems {{through the development of}} a novel coal gasification invention which incorporates pyrolysis (carbonization) with gasification (fixed-bed). It employs a pyrolyzer (carbonizer) to avoid sticky coal agglomeration caused in the conventional process of gradually heating coal through the 400 F to 900 F range. In so doing, the coal is rapidly heated sufficiently such that the coal tar exists in gaseous form rather than as a liquid. Gaseous tars are then thermally cracked prior to the completion of the gasification process. During the subsequent endothermic gasification reactions, volatilized alkali can become chemically bound to aluminosilicates in (or added to) the ash. To reduce NH{sub 3 } and HCN from fuel born nitrogen, steam injection is minimized, and residual nitrogen compounds are partially chemically reduced in the cracking stage in the upper gasifier region. Assuming testing confirms successful deployment of all these integrated processes, future IGCC applications will be much simplified, require significantly less mechanical components, and will likely achieve the $ 1, 000 /kWe commercialized system cost goal of the GPIF project.

40|$|The {{influence}} of iron oxide additions on coal pyrolysis {{has been studied}} by thermogravimetry and {{the analysis of the}} evolved gases. Liquid yields and tar composition were studied by complementary experiments on a larger scale. The presence of iron oxides reduces the primary-devolatilization rate of coal, between 300 and 600 Â°C. Tar and gaseous hydrocarbon yields decrease, but the tar composition does not change. Addition of magnetite, which is not reduced below 600 Â°C, results in a slight increase in hydrogen production at low temperature. However, at under 600 Â°C, Fe 2 O 3 is reduced to Fe 3 O 4, yielding a little CO 2 and water. Towards the end of the primary devolatilization of coal, in the presence of iron oxide, the production of methane increases. In every case hematite has a greater influence than magnetite. The effects are smaller at low heating rates, and they occur with small additions of oxide, further additions having less influence. Iron oxides do not affect the primary devolatilization of lignite. With <b>caking</b> <b>coals,</b> the {{influence of}} rank is small. These observations are attributed to a superposition of three effects: 1. (1) the physical effect of oxide particles among coal particles, impeding the formation of the plastic state, 2. (2) the catalytic effect upon aromatization reactions of the metaplast, to form semi-coke, and upon secondary-formation reactions of methane, and 3.

These processes actually involve a similar complex reaction network. The so-called "decoupling" refers to the optimization approach of process performance through controlling the interactions between or among the involved individual reactions. Our previous article in Energy & Fuels (2010, 24, 6223 - 6232) has analyzed how the approach of decoupling applies to the gasification technologies and justified the realized effects from decoupling. This successive report is devoted to understanding the applications of decoupling to the other types of {{thermochemical conversion}} technologies (mainly including pyrolysis and combustion) so as to generalize the "decoupling" methodology for innovations of thermochemical conversion technologies. After a reiteration of the principle and implementation approaches (isolating and staging) for decoupling reanalysis of the process design principle and its consequent technical superiorities based on decoupling is performed for a few well-known or emerging novel conversion technologies developed in the world.

40|$|Preparations for {{conducting}} large-scale combustion tests with <b>caking</b> bituminous <b>coal</b> continued during {{the start of}} this quarter. Major project accomplishments related to bituminous coal testing included: a CFD preheat model and evaluation, an update of the process flow diagram and a detailed preheat burner mechanical design (suitable for construction) for firing bituminous coal. Installation and testing of the 85 MMBtu/h bituminous coal preheating system was planned to take place before the end of December. Based on the inability to conduct testing in Riley's Commercial Burner Test Facility (CBTF) during freezing weather, a schedule review indicated required site work for testing bituminous coal at the CBTF could not be completed before freezing weather set in at the site. Further bituminous preheat modification work was put on hold and efforts turned to securing the test facility over the winter season. Bituminous coal tests are therefore delayed; April-May 2005 is earliest estimate of when testing can resume. A request for a time extension was submitted to DOE to extend the project through September 2005 to allow time to secure additional funding and complete the bituminous coal testing. Removal of the PRB PC Preheater from the CBTF burner deck was completed. Decommissioning of the CBTF for the winter was also completed...|$|R
40|$|PhD (Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 South Africa has {{large coal}} {{reserves}} and produces approximately 74 % of its primary energy from coal. Coal gasification using moving bed gasifiers {{is one of}} the most important coal utilisation technologies, consuming Â± 17. 5 % of locally produced coal. This study was motivated by the need to investigate alternative coal gasification technologies for the utilisation of fine, high-ash and <b>caking</b> <b>coals</b> for future Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and coal to liquids (CTL) plants. These coals are estimated to form a large percentage of the remaining coal reserves in South Africa and could be difficult to utilise efficiently in moving bed gasifiers. Fluidised bed gasification was identified as a technology that could potentially utilise these coals. Coals from the New Vaal and Grootegeluk collieries were selected as being suitable for this investigation. The coals were subjected to detailed characterisation, bench-scale and pilot-scale fluidised bed gasification tests. The results of the pilot-scale atmospheric bubbling fluidised bed gasification tests show that stable gasification is possible at temperatures between 880 Â°C and 980 Â°C. The maximum fixed carbon conversion achievable in the pilot plant is, however, limited to Â± 88 % due to the low reactivity of the coals tested and to thermal fragmentation and attrition of the coal in the gasifier. It was found that oxygen enrichment of the gasification air from 21 % to 36 % by means of oxygen addition produces a significant increase in the calorific value of the gas (3. 0 MJ/Nm 3 to 5. 5 MJ/Nm 3). This observation has not previously been reported at pilot-plant scale. A mathematical model for a bubbling fluidised bed coal gasifier was developed based on sub-models for fluidised bed hydrodynamics, coal devolatilisation, chemical reactions, transfer processes and fines generation. A coal devolatilisation sub-model to predict the products of coal devolatilisation in a fluidised bed gasifier was developed and incorporated into the model. Parameters associated with the rates of the gasification reactions and the devoltilisation process were obtained by means of bench-scale tests. The heat loss parameter (Q) in the model was estimated by means of a heat loss calculation. The results from the pilot-scale gasification tests were used to evaluate the predictive capability of the model. It was found that for temperature, fixed carbon conversion and calorific value of the gas the difference between measured and predicted values was less than 10 %. Recommendations are made for further refinement of the model to improve its predictive capability and range of application. The model was used to study the effect of major operating variables on gasifier performance. It was found that increasing the reactant gas (air, oxygen and steam) temperature from 250 Â°C to 550 Â°C increases the calorific value of the gas by Â± 9. 3 % and the gasification efficiency by Â± 6. 0 %. Increasing the fluidised bed height has a positive effect on fixed carbon conversion; however, at higher bed heights the benefit of increasing the bed height is less due to the inhibiting effects of H 2 and CO on the rates of char gasification.

30|$|The {{calorific values}} {{of all the}} coal samples are high enough {{and can be used}} for power generation. The Shankodi-Jangwa coal sample with the highest heating value of 6, 502.70 [*]cal/g may be the best for heating and power generation, but it may require sulphur {{reduction}} prior to use. The lower sulphur contents of both Tai and Garin Maiganga coal samples make them more suitable for smokeless fuel production, heating of residential buildings, firing kiln for cement production, raising steam for power generation and in foundry coke production without any concern of sulphur pollution. The coal samples may be used for liquefaction because lignitic, sub-bituminous and high-volatile bituminous coals are potentially good for liquefaction to produce synthetic crude oil and tar[23]. For coal gasification, the Shankodi-Jangwa coal sample, being bituminous, is the only coal sample with potentials for hydro-gasification to produce methane, even though there may be a problem of <b>caking</b> because bituminous <b>coals</b> are known to cake on gasification[23].|$|R
40|$|Goal is {{to develop}} a {{technology}} for producing microengineered adsorbent carbons from Illinois coal and to evaluate their potential application for storing natural gas for use in emerging low pressure, natural gas vehicles (NGVs). Focus is to design and engineer adsorbents that meet or exceed performance and cost targets established for low-pressure natural gas storage materials. Potentially, about two million tons adsorbent could be consumed in NGVs by year 2000. If successful, the results could lead to use of Illinois coal in a market that could exceed 6 million tons per year. Activated carbon samples were prepared from IBC- 106 coal by controlling both the preoxidation temperature and time, and the devolatilization temperature in order to eliminate <b>coal</b> <b>caking.</b> A 4. 6 cc pressurized vessel was constructed to measure the Vm/Vs methane adsorption capacity (volume of stored methane at STP per volume storage container). Several IBC- 106 derived activated carbons showed methane adsorption capacities comparable to that of a 1000 m{sup 2 }/g commercial activated carbon. Results indicated that surface area and micropore volume of activated carbons are important for natural gas storage.

40|$|PhD (Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{swelling}} and <b>caking</b> propensity of <b>coals</b> may cause operational {{problems such as}} channelling and excessive pressure build-up in combustion, gasification and specifically in fluidised-bed and fixed-bed operations. As a result, the {{swelling and}} caking characteristics of certain coals make them less suitable for use as feedstock in applications where swelling and/or caking is undesired. Therefore, various {{studies have focused on}} the manipulation of the swelling and/or <b>caking</b> propensity of <b>coals,</b> and have proven the viability of using additives to reduce the swelling and <b>caking</b> of powdered <b>coal</b> (< 500 Î¼m). However, there is still a lack of research specifically focused on large coal particle devolatilisation behaviour, particularly swelling and caking, and the reduction thereof using additives. A comprehensive study was therefore proposed to investigate the swelling and caking behaviour of large coal particles (5, 10, and 20 mm) of typical South African coals, and the influence of the selected additive (potassium carbonate) thereon. Three different South African coals were selected based on their Free Swelling Index (FSI) : coal TSH is a high swelling coal (FSI 9) from the Limpopo province, GG is a medium swelling coal (FSI 5. 5 - 6. 5) from the Waterberg region, and TWD is a non-swelling coal (FSI 0) from the Highveld region. Image analysis was used to semi-quantitatively describe the transient swelling and shrinkage behaviour of large coal particles (- 20 + 16 mm) during lowtemperature devolatilisation (700 Â°C, N 2 atmosphere, 7 K/min). X-ray computed tomography and mercury submersion were used to quantify the degree of swelling of large particles, and were compared to conventional swelling characteristics of powdered coals. The average swelling ratios obtained for TWD, GG, and TSH were respectively 1. 9, 2. 1 and 2. 5 from image analysis and 1. 8, 2. 2 and 2. 5 from mercury submersion. The results showed that coal swelling measurements such as FSI, and other conventional techniques used to describe the plastic behaviour of powdered coal, can in general not be used for the prediction of large coal particle swelling. The large coal particles were impregnated for 24 hours, using an excess 5. 0 M K 2 CO 3 impregnation solution. The influence of K 2 CO 3 -addition on the swelling behaviour of different coal particle sizes was compared, and results showed that the addition of K 2 CO 3 resulted in a reduction in swelling for powdered coal (- 212 Î¼m), as well as large coal particles (5, 10, and 20 mm). For powdered coal, the addition of 10 wt. % K 2 CO 3 decreased the free swelling index of GG and TSH coals from 6. 5 to 0 and from 9. 0 to 4. 5, respectively. The volumetric swelling ratios (SRV) of the 20 mm particles were reduced from 3. 0 to 1. 8 for the GG coal, and from 5. 7 to 1. 4 for TSH. In contrast to the non-swelling (FSI 0) behaviour of the TWD powders, the large particles exhibited average SRV values of 1. 7, and was found not be influenced by K 2 CO 3 -impregnation. It was found that the maximum swelling coefficient, kA, was reduced from 0. 025 to 0. 015 oC- 1 for GG, and from 0. 045 to 0. 027 oC- 1 for TSH, as a results of impregnation. From the results it was concluded that K 2 CO 3 -impregnation reduces the extent of swelling of coals such as GG (medium-swelling) and TSH (high-swelling), which exhibit significant plastic deformation. Results obtained from the caking experiments indicated that K 2 CO 3 -impregnation influenced the physical behaviour of the GG coal particles (5, 10, and 20 mm) the most. The extent of caking of GG was largely reduced due to impregnation, while the wall thickness and porosity also decreased. The coke from the impregnated GG samples had a less fluid-like appearance compared to coke from the raw coal. Bridging neck size measurements were performed, which quantitatively showed a 25 - 50 % decrease in the caking propensity of GG particles. Coal TWD did not exhibit any caking behaviour. The K 2 CO 3 -impregnation did not influence the surface texture or porosity of the TWD char, but increased the overall brittleness of the devolatilised samples. Both the extent of caking and porosity of TSH coke were not influenced by impregnation. However, impregnation resulted in significantly less and smaller opened pores {{on the surface of the}} devolatilised samples, and also reduced the average wall thickness of the TSH coke. The overall conclusion made from this investigation is that K 2 CO 3 (using solution impregnation) can be used to significantly reduce the caking and swelling tendency of large coal particles which exhibits a moderate degree of fluidity, such as GG (Waterberg region). The results obtained during this investigation show the viability of using additive addition to reduce the caking and swelling tendency of large coal particles. Together with further development, this may be a suitable method for modifying the swelling and caking behaviour of specific coals for use in fixed-bed and fluidised-bed gasification operations.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{weathering}} on the modification of chemical, petrological and rheological properties of four metallurgical coals in different rank and geology was investigated. And that of coke qualities of these coals was investigated by 25 kg pilot coke oven. Weathering tests {{were carried out}} by storing coal in 20 ton pile on an open industrial yard for up to 208 days. Coal characteristics and coke qualities were monitored over an interval of one month. The mixture of four metallurgical coals was used to investigate the effect of weathering duration on the modification of coal blending as well. With increasing weathering, oxygen concentration was increased as expected, and calorific values were marginally decreased. This study confirmed the adverse effect of weathering on the <b>caking</b> properties of <b>coals</b> such as fluidity, dilation and swelling behaviours as well as coal melting temperature range. The study illustrated that effect of short term and long term weathering on the modification of rheological properties of coals is significantly different. Unlike general idea like low rank coals normally get greater impact of weathering than high rank coals, {{this study suggests that}} long term weathering may have a strong impact on the modification of rheological properties of relatively higher rank coals with high ash yield. With increasing weathering time, inert textures and small pores increased, while calorific values of all cokes marginally decreased. The coke cold strength from weathered coals decreased as well as their size. However the rank of coals and fluidity loss didn't show clear relationship with this quality drop. On the other hand, the coke size decreased in accordance with the fluidity drop. The fluidity of coal blending remained stable for a while, and then it dropped seriously according to weathering time with narrowed fluid ranges of individual coals. Coke strength of coal blending in both cold and hot state decreased significantly and continuously. Therefore, this study suggests that even though the individual coals may not be affected seriously by weathering, the weathering effects can be severe when different rank coals are use together...|$|R
