5000|$|The micromirrors are {{organized}} in a so-called [...] "offset-diamond pixel layout" [...] of 960Ã—1080 micromirrors, rotated 45 degrees, with their center points {{placed in the}} center of [...] "black" [...] squares on the checkerboard. The DMD employs full-pixel wobulation to display the complete 1080p image as two half-resolution images in a fast sequence. The DMD operates at twice the refresh rate, i.e. 120 Hz, and the complete 1080p picture is displayed in two steps. On the first cadence, only half of the original 1080p60 image is displayed - the pixels that correspond to the [...] "black" [...] squares of the checkerboard pattern. On the second cadence, the DMD array is mechanically shifted (<b>wobulated)</b> by one pixel, so the micromirrors are now in a position previously occupied by the gaps, and another half of the image is displayed - this time, the pixels that correspond to the [...] "white" [...] squares.|$|E
