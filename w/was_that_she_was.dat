25|$|Two {{rumors about}} finalist Katharine McPhee {{circulated}} during early March {{and throughout the}} season. The first <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> quitting the show and would not {{show up for the}} March 7th airing. The second was sparked by the loose fitting blouses she had been wearing, leading viewers to suspect she was pregnant. Katharine denied both rumors when interviewed by host Ryan Seacrest on the March 7th show.|$|E
25|$|Although Tamm {{had left}} the show on {{relatively}} good terms and was willing to film a regeneration sequence {{for the start of}} Season 17, she was not invited to do so. It has frequently been mentioned that the real reason Tamm left the show after one year, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> pregnant. This is untrue, as often stated by Tamm herself over the years. The revelation is a myth that was started by former producer John Nathan-Turner. Various sources, including some online sites, mention that the reason she couldn't film a regeneration sequence, was because she was pregnant.|$|E
25|$|Laënnec {{was almost}} sunk on her maiden voyage when she {{collided}} with an English steam ship Penzance in the Bay of Biscay, sinking the fully laden steamer within minutes. Laënnec, also seriously damaged, was towed to Barry for repairs. One {{of the reasons}} for the incident <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not carrying enough sailing ballast on her voyage from the shipyard, and as a result her rudder was not completely submerged in water, significantly reducing the maneuverability of the ship. Towards the end of the nine-month voyage, while carrying potassium nitrate from Chile to Bremerhaven, Germany, a minor mutiny broke out when four crew members disobeyed orders from Captain Turbé.|$|E

25|$|Mireille {{spent all}} of 1966 and 1967 touring. It was then, during a car ride to another concert, that Stark advised Mireille that she was finally debt free, and worth {{more than a million}} francs ($200k USD in 1967). She had always prayed that she could get her family out of poverty, but the touring and singing were much more {{important}} at the time. In her autobiography, she stated her first major purchases were a vehicle for her father's business and a large home for her parents and siblings. Most importantly, she had a telephone installed for the family, so her parents no longer {{had to go to the}} pharmacy to talk to her while she was in Paris. Her one regret, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> unable to see her grandmother Germaine in the hospital before she died because of all the tour contracts.|$|E

[...] Doyle furthered that her statements were never enough to offend others and the harshest criticism that could be bestowed upon her <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> boring.|$|E

500|$|From late November 2006 to mid-January 2007, Stratus {{temporarily}} {{moved to}} Muncie, Indiana for the CBS reality show Armed & Famous. She {{was given a}} spot in the series after Paul Heyman had mentioned her name to CBS. The concept <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> one of five celebrities who trained as volunteer officers with the Muncie Police Department. After finishing her training, Stratus and her real life officer partner were followed around by a camera crew while going on legitimate police calls. Although the show was scheduled to broadcast seven episodes starting on January 10, 2007, CBS canceled the series after just four of the episodes were aired. After the cancellation of Armed & Famous, Stratus hosted The Second City's Next Comedy Legend. The contest was similar to the style of America's Next Top Model, with Stratus portraying the [...] "Tyra Banks" [...] role as contact between the contestants and judges.|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{has named}} {{communist}} {{and civil rights}} activist Jessica Mitford as her [...] "most influential writer" [...] saying, [...] "Jessica Mitford has been my heroine since I was 14 years old, when I overheard my formidable great-aunt discussing how Mitford had run away {{at the age of}} 19 to fight with the Reds in the Spanish Civil War", and claims what inspired her about Mitford <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "incurably and instinctively rebellious, brave, adventurous, funny and irreverent, she liked nothing better than a good fight, preferably against a pompous and hypocritical target". Rowling has described Jane Austen as her favourite author, calling Emma her favourite book in O, The Oprah Magazine. As a child, Rowling has said her early influences included The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, The Little White Horse by Elizabeth Goudge, and Manxmouse by Paul Gallico.|$|E
500|$|The 23-minute and 46-second {{episode was}} written by Jon Cooksey, Ali Marie Matheson, J. David Stem, David N. Weiss, Susan Hood, and Ed Resto. Directed by Norton Virgien and Toni Vian, it was {{produced}} by the animation studio Klasky Csupo Productions, a part of Nickelodeon Animation Studio. Cella Nichols Duffy, Gabor Csupo, Arlene Klasky, Paul De Meyer, Stem, and Weiss also produced the episode. Mark Mothersbaugh and Ruby Andrews contributed to the music. In 2016, co-creator Paul Germain revealed that the concept for the episode, and the discussion {{about the status of}} Chuckie's mother, was previously pitched to Nickelodeon executives. She {{was not included in the}} first season to avoid the need to animate a completely new character. During the production of the show's second and third seasons, Germain noticed that questions about the character's absence became more prominent. He consulted with fellow co-creator Arlene Klasky, and they concluded that the only two possible ways to address the character <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> divorced from Chaz, or had died before the series' debut.|$|E

500|$|From the 1930s to the 1950s the BBC {{operated}} {{a de facto}} ban on dramatising Blyton's books for radio, considering {{her to be a}} [...] "second-rater" [...] whose work was without literary merit. The children's literary critic Margery Fisher likened Blyton's books to [...] "slow poison", and Jean E. Sutcliffe of the BBC's schools broadcast department wrote of Blyton's ability to churn out [...] "mediocre material", noting that [...] "her capacity to do so amounts to genius... anyone else would have died of boredom long ago". Michael Rosen, Children's Laureate from 2007 until 2009, wrote that [...] "I find myself flinching at occasional bursts of snobbery and the assumed level of privilege of the children and families in the books." [...] The children's author Anne Fine presented an overview of the concerns about Blyton's work and responses to them on BBC Radio 4 in November 2008, in which she noted the [...] "drip, drip, drip of disapproval" [...] associated with the books. Blyton's response to her critics <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> uninterested in the views of anyone over the age of 12, claiming that half the attacks on her work were motivated by jealousy and the rest came from [...] "stupid people who don't know what they're talking about because they've never read any of my books".|$|E
500|$|Lead {{writer and}} {{executive}} producer Russell T Davies chose the name Rose because he considered it a [...] "good luck charm" [...] after he used it for Lesley Sharp's character in Bob & Rose. His desire to make the show [...] "essentially British" [...] was another justification: he considered Rose to be [...] "the most British name in the world" [...] and feminine enough to subvert a recent trend of female companions having [...] "boyish" [...] names, such as Peri, Benny, Charley, and Ace. Davies also frequently uses the surname [...] "Tyler" [...] in his work—previous characters he created with the surname include Ruth Tyler in Revelations (1994), Vince Tyler in Queer as Folk (1999), and Johnny Tyler in The Second Coming (2003)—due to his affection for how the surname is spelled and pronounced. The casting of Piper as Rose was announced on by the BBC on 24 May 2004. Head of Drama for BBC Wales Julie Gardner commented that the former pop star [...] "fits the bill perfectly" [...] as a [...] "unique, dynamic partner for Christopher Eccleston". Whilst some fans—including {{a representative of the}} Doctor Who Appreciation Society—were enthusiastic about the announcement, others felt it was [...] "publicity stunt" [...] casting and questioned Piper's acting credentials. One of the factors that influenced Piper's acceptance of the role <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> able to relate the character of Rose to her own experiences as a teenager.|$|E
500|$|Minogue {{has been}} {{inspired}} by and compared to Madonna throughout her career. Her producer, Pete Waterman, recalled Minogue {{during the early years}} of her success with the observation: [...] "She was setting her sights on becoming the new Prince or Madonna... What I found amazing <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> outselling Madonna four to one, but still wanted to be her." [...] Minogue received negative comments that her Rhythm of Love tour in 1991 was too similar visually to Madonna's Blond Ambition World Tour, for which critics labelled her a Madonna wannabe. Kathy McCabe for The Telegraph noted that Minogue and Madonna follow similar styles in music and fashion, but concluded, [...] "Where they truly diverge on the pop-culture scale is in shock value. Minogue's clips might draw a gasp from some but Madonna's ignite religious and political debate unlike any other artist on the planet... Simply, Madonna is the dark force; Kylie is the light force." [...] Rolling Stone commented that, with the exception of the US, Minogue is regarded throughout the world as [...] "an icon to rival Madonna", saying, [...] "Like Madonna, Minogue was not a virtuosic singer but a canny trend spotter." [...] Minogue has said of Madonna, [...] "Her huge influence on the world, in pop and fashion, meant that I wasn't immune to the trends she created. I admire Madonna greatly but in the beginning she made it difficult for artists like me, she had done everything there was to be done", and [...] "Madonna's the Queen of Pop, I'm the princess. I'm quite happy with that." [...] Minogue has been declared by media as a sex symbol.|$|E

500|$|... "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] {{was written}} by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones, who directed all of season two's episodes. David {{came up with the}} idea of the real-time episode while he and Seinfeld were waiting for a table at a Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles. When David presented the episode to NBC executives, he received a negative reaction. The network felt that there was no real story and viewers would not be interested. Executive Warren Littlefield commented that he thought there were pages missing from the script he had received. David argued that each character had a storyline: Jerry's story was he recognized a woman but did not know from where; Elaine's story <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very hungry; and George's story was that he was unable to use the phone. NBC disagreed and objected to the broadcast of the episode. To satisfy the executives, staff writer Larry Charles suggested the group's storyline to be on their way to a one-night screening of Plan 9 from Outer Space, and thus introducing a [...] "ticking clock" [...] scenario to the story. When the NBC executives still objected, David threatened to quit the show if the network would force any major changes upon the script. Seinfeld supported David and NBC eventually allowed them to produce [...] "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] without any significant alterations, although they strongly advised them not go through with it, and postponed the broadcast until near the end of the season. In 2015, Seinfeld writer Spike Feresten revealed that the host's calling [...] "Cartwright" [...] instead of [...] "Costanza" [...] was a subtle allusion to the classic western show Bonanza. [...] "Bonanza" [...] rhymes with [...] "Costanza" [...] and the show's main characters are the [...] "Cartwright" [...] family.|$|E
500|$|Multiple storylines {{spanning}} {{the first two}} seasons were brought to a close in the two-part season finale, including {{the search for the}} demon Azazel and the existence of Azazel's psychic children. As many of the show's questions are answered in one long conversation by Azazel, series creator Eric Kripke and writer Sera Gamble had to rewrite the demon's speech multiple times because they felt that [...] "the payoff [...] never as good as the anticipation". Though {{it would have been easier}} for them to keep postponing the revelations, the writers believed they would get [...] "crushed under the anticipation" [...] because they would not be able to satisfy fans if they kept building up more expectations. As for the psychic children, the writers originally intended to continue their storyline into the third season, but ultimately killed them off after deciding that the characters were not as interesting as demons and monsters. In the first version of the script, the character of Lily was two roles: a girl named Alex who could kill with a single touch, and a telepath named Lily. Believing they had too many characters, the writers combined Alex and Lily into one. Gamble had envisioned the episode as a [...] "psychic Breakfast Club", so the new Lily's motivation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> Ally Sheedy. The Acheri demon responsible for two of the psychic children's deaths was based on the Acheri from Hindu mythology; writer Sera Gamble felt that it being a [...] "diseased spirit" [...] that comes down from the mountains and [...] "kills everybody in the settlements" [...] fit in with the abandoned mountain-side town that the episode takes place in. Harvelle's Roadhouse—a saloon frequented by demon hunters—was dropped from the show in these episodes as well, as Kripke disliked the concept of having a fixed home for a road-based series. With the Roadhouse's destruction came the death of recurring character Ash, whom the writers had been phasing out during the season because they felt his [...] "comical" [...] and [...] "wacky" [...] personality was too unrealistic for the show.|$|E
2500|$|UNI Yeh, on {{her first}} {{appearance}} [...] on the Voice of China, introduced herself as being from [...] "Pingtung District, China Taipei," [...] which caused an uproar among Taiwanese netizens.

5000|$|The biggest myth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dumb. The second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> fragile.

2500|$|Chubbuck's show, Suncoast Digest, {{stayed on}} the air for several years with new hosts. Simmons, the station director, said Chubbuck's suicide was {{unrelated}} to the station.

2500|$|There {{is little}} {{available}} {{information about her}} nationality or early life.

One <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{the daughter of a}} pork butcher, whom Tudor met when he was posted at Constantinople in 1921. Larissa was said to be a belly-dancer at a night club in Constantinople. A second account of her early life <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a woman of good family from St. Petersburg. The colonel of Tudor's regiment reportedly sent brother officers either to teach him some Russian before his marriage or to try to persuade Tudor not to marry Larissa. Tudor, who was in love with Larissa, went ahead with the marriage and was forced to leave the regiment. One of Tudor's first cousins was told that Larissa had escaped from Russia and had been [...] "earning her living the only way she could." ...|$|E
