5|$|In the movie, Greene kills Shondor Birns by detonating a bomb on his car. In reality, {{even though}} Birns {{was killed by}} a car bomb, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> to link Greene to his murder. Even though it is {{commonly}} speculated that Greene killed Birns, his murder remains officially unsolved.|$|E
50|$|The fact <b>is</b> there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> {{for global}} warming, i.e. there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> interjection Let {{me tell you}} that the seas are not rising any more than is in any way out of the ordinary; the ice is not decreasing, it is {{increasing}}; the polar bears are increasing in number; and the temperature is going down not up. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> for this whatsoever.|$|R
60|$|There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence,</b> from {{a roll of}} schoolboys at Stratford Free Grammar School, about 1564-77, {{that any}} given boy {{attended}} it; for no roll exists. Consequently there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> that Will <b>was</b> a pupil.|$|R

There are few, if any, nutritional differences between organic and conventional milk. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> that any differences that may exist are clinically relevant. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> that organic milk has clinically significant higher bacterial contamination levels than does conventional milk. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> that conventional milk contains significantly increased amounts of bovine growth hormone. Any bovine GH that might remain in conventional milk is not biologically active in humans because of structural differences and susceptibility to digestion in the stomach." ...|$|R
5|$|It was {{initially}} reported {{that some of}} the attackers were British citizens, but the Indian government later stated that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> to confirm this. Similarly, early reports of 12 gunmen were also later shown to be incorrect.|$|E
5|$|Arguing for {{the defence}} was lawyer Jagmal Singh. He {{asserted}} that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> against the accused {{and that it}} was all contrived by the media, no evidence that the khap panchayat ever met to discuss the fate of the couple, and no evidence indicating that Manoj and Babli were dead. The cremated bodies recovered from the canal were never confirmed to be those of Manoj and Babli.|$|E
5|$|At one time, one {{hurricane}} researcher {{identified a}} tropical storm over Cuba in late August, although there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> the storm actually existed. There was also a report of a hurricane over Louisiana on October22, although it is unknown if it was related to other storms in the season. There may have been additional unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the {{survivors}} filed a claim with a South Korean compensation committee under the binational Status of Forces Agreement. This time, the U.S. claims service responded by again citing what it claimed was a combat situation, and by asserting that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> the 1st Cavalry Division {{was in the}} No Gun Ri area, as {{the survivors}}' research and the 1961 official Army history of the war indicated.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the {{controversy}} was revived. Alerted to the incident, American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), which had established the Cornelius P. Rhoads Memorial Award in 1979, commissioned a new investigation. It {{was led by}} Jay Katz, emeritus professor at Yale Law School and a specialist in medical ethics. He concluded there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of unethical human experimentation, but the letter was so offensive that the prize should be renamed. AACR concurred and stripped the honor from Rhoads because of his racism.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Sikorski was exhumed and his {{remains were}} {{examined}} by Polish scientists, who in 2009 concluded that he died due to injuries consistent with an air crash, and that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> that Sikorski was murdered, ruling out theories that he was shot or strangled before the incident; however they did {{not rule out the}} possibility of sabotage, which is still being investigated by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance. , the investigation continues.|$|E

5|$|In September 1993, {{after the}} field of the hoard find was ploughed, the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service {{surveyed}} the field, finding four gold coins and 81 silver coins, all {{considered part of the}} same hoard. Both earlier Iron Age and later mediaeval materials were also discovered, but there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of a Roman settlement in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|On 14August1942, Herring {{was ordered}} to Esk, Queensland, to assume command of II Corps with the {{temporary}} rank of Lieutenant General. As such, {{he was responsible for}} the defence of Brisbane. At this time he was criticised in Federal Parliament by Arthur Calwell for allegedly issuing a verbal order whilst commander of the 6th Division that no officer was to be commissioned unless they had at least attained an Intermediate Certificate. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> that such an order was ever issued, but the allegation reflected a suspicion that Herring was an elitist.|$|E
5|$|On July22, 1916, a bomb {{exploded}} during the San Francisco Preparedness Day Parade, killing ten people and wounding 40. Police suspected Berkman, although there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence,</b> and ultimately their investigation focused on two local labor activists, Thomas Mooney and Warren Billings. Although neither Mooney nor Billings were anarchists, Berkman {{came to their}} aid: raising a defense fund, hiring lawyers, and beginning a national campaign on their behalf. Mooney and Billings were convicted, with Mooney sentenced to death and Billings to life imprisonment.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} the fire could not be {{determined}} with certainty. One possibility is that a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, {{and the opening of}} the elevator shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing the fire to spread. There is also a theory that the fire was set by burglars who tried to cover their tracks; however, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of a burglary.|$|E
5|$|The {{site and}} the finds from it are the {{property}} of the Glastonbury Antiquarian Society. Many of the finds from the site are on display in the Glastonbury Lake Village Museum at The Tribunal in Glastonbury High Street, and in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. The burial sites of ten new born babies were uncovered, but there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of the interment of adults from the village.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{pre-season}} preparations were {{overshadowed by}} an accident involving Fernando Alonso {{on the final}} day of testing that saw Alonso hospitalised with a concussion and ruled out of the third and final test. Kevin Magnussen, McLaren's test and reserve driver, was drafted in as his replacement for the remainder of the test and the opening round of the season. Alonso later attributed the accident to a steering failure, although McLaren maintained that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of a car failure in the telemetry data following the accident.|$|E

5|$|A {{forensic}} {{examination of}} Docherty's body indicated she {{had probably been}} suffocated, but {{it could not be}} proven. Although the police suspected the men of other murders, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> on which they could take action. An offer was put to Hare granting immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence. He provided the details of Docherty's murder and confessed to all 16 deaths; formal charges were made against Burke and his wife for three murders. At the subsequent trial Burke was found guilty of one murder and sentenced to death. The case against his wife was found not proven—a Scottish legal verdict to acquit an individual but not declare them innocent. Burke was hanged shortly afterwards, his corpse was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the Anatomical Museum of Edinburgh Medical School where, as of 2017, it remains.|$|E
5|$|A {{grand jury}} petition, bearing over 1,400 {{signatures}} across 134 pages, was {{filed with the}} Tulsa County election board by Medlin on November 6, 1989. The petition alleged that local and state officials violated the state's open meetings, conspiracy, and conflict of interest laws while planning the turnpike. The election board certified the petition as meeting the required threshold of 1,000 signatures on December 15. Work on the turnpike continued despite the investigation. After meeting for seven days, on January 19, 1990, the grand jury determined that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> to support the allegations and no need for further investigation.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{population}} of the Northern states believed that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and although there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> of their complicity, it was a political reality that had to be dealt with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at La Grange, he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.|$|E
