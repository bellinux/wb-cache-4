This study investigates the barriers employers face in hiring people <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> through two methodologies; semi-structured interviews and case studies.

40|$|At colleges or {{universities}} students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> {{have to be}} mainstreamed. Therefore, {{each year}} {{quite a lot of}} students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> can be found in classes scattered over the different colleges and universities in every country. However, most teachers have not been instructed how to teach students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in a mainstream classroom. Thus, they worry about changes in the syllabus, availability of suitable textbooks, and how to teach all students together in an effective way. Obtaining necessary information about the students’ problems and sources for help are paramount for the successful integration of students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> into the mainstream classroom. This paper, therefore, aims to provide information for teachers with little or no background knowledge in special education. Several of the problems discussed in this paper are of concern for teachers of students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in general, but some aspects are of special interest for foreign language teachers and are not normally found in guidelines provided to teachers of students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in mainstream classes...|$|R

Among its features was specially designed lighting to help pupils read and navigate their way around more easily. The school later began to extend its facilities and to enrol students with other disabilities, while in 1960 a grammar school department was added to enable disabled students from across the United Kingdom to attain a grammar school level of education. It was, for many years, predominantly a boarding school with pupils attending from across the United Kingdom, and it was regarded as being among the best in its field.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} the way general teachers teach students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in inclusive classrooms {{and the challenges}} facing them. The intention was specifically {{to find out the}} ways general teachers adapt their teaching to make sure that inclusion of students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> is appreciated and realized. Furthermore, it intended to uncover the challenges these general teachers face when teaching students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in inclusive classrooms. This study was conducted at one of the secondary school located in southern part of the country. It employed qualitative case study design using four (4) general teachers teaching in classes having students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments.</b> Data collection was done using semi-structured interviews and participant- observation methods. The findings revealed that general teachers have little knowledge about inclusive education and how it should be practiced not only for students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> but for all students with special needs. The knowledge about inclusion and teaching in inclusive classrooms is highly needed among general teachers to practice inclusive teaching for students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in a professional manner. Preparation of teaching resources,like audio and tactile materials, reading braille writings, and instructing students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> the proper ways of using their visual devices, {{is said to be the}} role of a special needs teacher. However, it is also advisable for a general teacher to have some of this knowledge in order to counteract the challenges associated with teaching students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in inclusive classrooms. Furthermore, findings showed that, general teachers were not using the little knowledge of teaching in inclusive classrooms they have, due to many challenges surrounding the whole inclusive teaching in secondary schools like scarcity of both general and special needs teachers and lack of commitment among them, scarcity of resource and rigid curriculum. Building from the findings, it is recommended that, the Government should improve the situation of inclusive teaching, such as training teachers in the area of special education to help them conduct their teaching properly. The government should also allocate enough funds to inclusive schools to ensure availability of teaching and learning facilities that will help facilitate teaching students <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> in inclusive classrooms.
