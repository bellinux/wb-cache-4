60|$|Only {{twice in}} the year did the Europeans at that lonely outpost receive letters from home. Little wonder that they longed for them, and that they went almost <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy</b> when they came.|$|E

60|$|A {{few minutes}} more and the natives came pouring round him, <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> {{excitement}} and <b>joy.</b> Soon {{he was joined}} by his own comrades.|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Saunders {{has just}} gone to her room; she'll {{be back in}} a moment." [...] She added, <b>with</b> <b>wild</b> <b>joy</b> in a fact which veiled the truth, [...] "She is writing a note." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{impulse was}} {{communicated to the}} Teton horses, long {{accustomed}} to sympathise in the untutored passions of their owners, and it was with difficulty that the keepers were enabled to restrain their impatience. At this moment, when all eyes were directed to the passing whirlwind of men and beasts, the trapper caught the knife {{from the hands of}} his inattentive keeper, with a power that his age would have seemed to contradict, and, at a single blow, severed the thong of hide which connected the whole of the drove. The <b>wild</b> animals snorted <b>with</b> <b>joy</b> and terror, and tearing the earth with their heels, they dashed away into the broad prairies, in a dozen different directions.|$|R
60|$|It was sunny October weather. He seemed <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy,</b> like {{a schoolboy}} escaped; then again {{he was silent}} and reserved. He was more gaunt than ever, {{and there was a}} haggard look in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|George Barstow went arter it, but {{he might}} as well ha' tried to catch the wind. The cat was arf <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy</b> at getting out agin, and he couldn't get within arf a mile of it.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Morel {{had had a}} {{few pounds}} left to her by her father, and she decided to buy her son out of the army. He was <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy.</b> Now {{he was like a}} lad taking a holiday.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{the morning}} {{following}} the successful sortie not an enemy {{could be seen}} from the walls. Swift runners were sent out, and these returned in two hours with news that the enemy were in full retreat towards their capital. The people of Abeokuta were half <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> exultation and <b>joy,</b> and their gratitude to their white allies was unbounded. Mr. Goodenough begged them not to lose an hour in burying their slain enemies, and the entire population were engaged for the two following days upon this necessary but revolting duty. The dead were counted as they were placed in the great pits dug for their reception, and it was found that no fewer than three thousand of the enemy had fallen.|$|R
6000|$|His next {{awakening}} {{was caused}} by shouts and cries. He raised himself on one elbow and looked out of his hole. A large body of Russian soldiers had entered the village, and were welcomed <b>with</b> <b>wild</b> <b>joy</b> by the Bulgarians, while the Turkish inhabitants--those of them {{who had not been}} able or willing to leave--remained quiet, but polite. The column halted. The men swarmed about the place and [...] "requisitioned," [...] as the phrase goes, whatever they wanted--that is, they took what they chose from the people, whether they were willing or not. To do them justice, they paid for it, though in most cases the payment was too little.|$|R
60|$|Dick Varley {{was almost}} <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> delight. It {{was his first}} {{excursion}} into the remote wilderness; he was young, healthy, strong, and romantic; {{and it is a}} question whether his or his dog's heart, or that of the noble wild horse he bestrode, bounded most <b>with</b> <b>joy</b> at the glorious sights, and sounds, and influences by which they were surrounded. It would have been perfection {{had it not been for}} the frequent annoyance and alarms caused by the Indians.|$|R
60|$|The prince was <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy</b> at the pigeon's {{return with}} the note. After an hour's rest the trusty little bird {{was sent back}} again, {{carrying}} a miniature of the prince, which by good luck he had with him.|$|E
60|$|They were by {{that time}} close to the pier-head, where the people were {{shouting}} and cheering, some of them even weeping, and waving hats, 'kerchiefs, sticks, and umbrellas, almost <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy</b> at seeing so many fellow-creatures rescued from the maw of the hungry sea.|$|E
60|$|The next day, {{when the}} couple rose, they saw an {{enormous}} head looking in at their bedroom window, and behind it was a cow which was nearly as big as their hut. Kirsten was <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy</b> {{to think of the}} money the cow would bring them.|$|E

60|$|Bo was <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy,</b> and {{by turns}} {{she laughed and}} cried. But Helen could not voice her feelings. Her eyes were so dim that she could {{scarcely}} see Dale when he loomed over her as she held Bo. But he found the hand she put shakily out.|$|E
6000|$|Of {{course the}} {{visitors}} went <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy,</b> and shouted themselves hoarse. They waved their colors, swung their rattles, and tooted their horns for fully five minutes, while the silence among the Brill contingent was so thick {{it could be}} [...] "cut with a knife," [...] as Sam afterward expressed it.|$|E

60|$|Two days passed, {{and then}} Dave got long letters from Phil and Roger. Senator Morr {{had been to}} see Mr. Lawrence and had {{arranged}} to have his son go on the long trip to the South Seas. Roger was almost <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy,</b> {{and said he was}} going to prepare for the trip immediately.|$|E
60|$|At last he stopped, on April 6th, to {{take another}} observation. This showed him to be within {{a few miles of}} the Pole, and if he went <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy,</b> who can blame him? He called to those with him, and away they went over the ice, paying no heed to the keen wind that cut like a knife.|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE (unabashed). Well, I don't care. I can't {{be unhappy}} about anything. I shall never be unhappy again, never, never, never, while grass grows or water runs.

6000|$|To {{say that}} Ailie was delighted, {{would be to}} {{understate}} the fact very much. She was <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy,</b> and went about all the day, after her father's decision was announced, making every species of insane preparation for the canoe voyage, clasping her hands, and exclaiming, [...] "Oh! what fun!" [...] while her bright eyes sparkled {{to such an extent}} that the sailors fairly laughed in her face when they looked at her.|$|E
60|$|The {{election}} {{which the}} young orator {{expected to be}} another moment of great interest really came as a matter-of-fact ending to a long and triumphant canvass. He had held victory in his hand until she was tamed. The election simply confirmed the universal prophecy. He was elected, and while the Democrats went <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy,</b> Bradley slept quietly in his bed at home--while the brass band played itself quiescent under his window.|$|E
60|$|Early on {{the morning}} of the second day, Gale, who had {{acquired}} an unbreakable habit of watching, saw three white horses and a bay come wearily stepping down the road. He heard Blanco Sol's familiar whistle, and he leaped up <b>wild</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy.</b> The horse was riderless. Gale's sudden joy received a violent check, then resurged when he saw a limp white form in Jim Lash's arms. Ladd was supporting a horseman who wore a military uniform.|$|E
