25|$|File:Se de Lisboa Frente adj sky.JPG|Lisbon Cathedral, Portugal, 1147, has {{a similar}} form to the Old Cathedral of Coimbra above with the {{addition}} of two sturdy bell towers in the Norman manner and a <b>wheel</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
25|$|The cathedral is {{flanked by}} two square towers, each {{supported}} with two buttresses and crowned with a cupola. The façade lacks decoration and is rather architecturally heterogeneous. It shows a Baroque porch and a beautiful Gothic <b>wheel</b> <b>window</b> under a crenellated arch, giving {{the impression of a}} fortified church.|$|E
25|$|Romanesque church facades, {{generally}} {{to the west}} end of the building, are usually symmetrical, have a large central portal made significant by its mouldings or porch, and an arrangement of arched-topped windows. In Italy there is often a single central ocular or <b>wheel</b> <b>window.</b> The common decorative feature is arcading.|$|E
50|$|In England {{there exist}} five Romanesque <b>wheel</b> <b>windows,</b> notably those at Barfreston and Castle Hedingham parish churches.|$|R

5000|$|The nine {{stained-glass windows}} in the chancel were made by Mayer & Company of Munich. [...] Louis Comfort Tiffany {{designed}} the mosaics below the dome and in the sanctuary. Tiffany also designed the stained glass of the clerestory <b>windows</b> and <b>wheel</b> <b>windows</b> of the transepts.|$|R
25|$|A high parapet extends {{above the}} fourth floor and it is {{composed}} of a more coarse brick than {{is the rest of}} the facade. This is the scar remaining from a large cornice, either made of pressed tin or Terra cotta, that was removed from the building after a 1913 fire, harming its architectural integrity greatly. The pilasters continue through the parapet and the central pilasters and recessed within a brick equilateral arch is a Terra cotta <b>wheel</b> <b>window</b> design flanked at the base by Terra cotta fillets filling out the base of the arch.|$|E
2500|$|The village hall is a single-story, {{rectangular}} {{structure with}} a gable roof and a three-bay front porch. [...] It {{is covered with}} clapboard and has a leaded <b>wheel</b> <b>window</b> in the gable end. A single-story addition of similar construction houses fire-fighting equipment. The water tower consists of a clapboard-covered shaft enclosing the stand pipe. It was originally topped with a small wooden tank; the current steel tank was installed in 1931. The George F. Porter School is a two-story rectangular Classical Revival structure, constructed of brick with a hipped roof. Two entryways with sandstone porches are flanked by Tuscan columns. Above these are two hip-roofed dormers and twin octagonal cupolas. Two single-story wings {{were added to the}} school in 1920 and 1929.|$|E
60|$|Now observe, this throne, {{with all}} the {{canopies}} below it, and the complete representation of the Duomo of Florence opposite, are of finished Gothic of Orecagna's school--later than Giotto's Gothic. But the building in which the apostles are gathered at the Pentecost is of the early Romanesque mosaic school, with a <b>wheel</b> <b>window</b> from the duomo of Assisi, and square windows from the Baptistery of Florence. And this is always the type of architecture used by Taddeo Gaddi: while the finished Gothic {{could not possibly have}} been drawn by him, but is absolute evidence of the later hand.|$|E
50|$|Romanesque facades with oculi include San Miniato al Monte, Florence, 11th century, San Michele, Pavia, c. 1117, and Pistoia Cathedral, 1150. As {{the windows}} {{increased}} in {{size in the}} later Romanesque period, <b>wheel</b> <b>windows</b> became a standard feature {{of which there are}} fine examples at San Zeno Maggiore, Verona and Monza Cathedral.|$|R
60|$|I never shall succeed even in {{reminding}} {{myself of}} the venerable magnificence of this minster, with its arches, its columns, its cornice of popes' heads, its great <b>wheel</b> <b>windows,</b> its manifold ornament, all combining in one vast effect, though many men have labored individually, {{and through a}} long course of time, to produce this multifarious handiwork and headwork.|$|R
50|$|Many {{architectural}} {{features that}} are associated with Gothic architecture had been developed and used by the architects of Romanesque buildings, but not fully exploited. These include ribbed vaults, buttresses, clustered columns, ambulatories, <b>wheel</b> <b>windows,</b> spires, stained glass windows, and richly carved door tympana. These features, namely the rib vault and the pointed arch, had been used since the late 11th century in Southern Italy, Durham, and Picardy.|$|R
60|$|As {{the cathedral}} {{was not yet}} open, and as J----- and I had not so much {{patience}} as my wife, we left her and Miss Shepard, {{and set out to}} return to the hotel. We lost our way, however, and finally had to return to the cathedral, to take a fresh start; and as the door was now open we went in. We found the cathedral very stately with its great arches, and darkly magnificent with the dim rich light coming through its painted windows, some of which are reckoned the most beautiful that the whole world has to show. The hues are far more brilliant than those of any painted glass I saw in England, and a great <b>wheel</b> <b>window</b> looks like a constellation of many-colored gems. The old English glass gets so smoky and dull with dust, that its pristine beauty cannot any longer be even imagined; nor did I imagine it till I saw these Italian windows. We saw nothing of my wife and Miss Shepard; but found afterwards that they had been much annoyed by the attentions of a priest who wished to show them the cathedral, till they finally told him that they had no money with them, when he left them without another word. The attendants in churches seem to be quite as venal as most other Italians, and, for the sake of their little profit, they do not hesitate to interfere with the great purposes for which their churches were built and decorated; hanging curtains, for instance, before all the celebrated pictures, or hiding them away in the sacristy, so that they cannot be seen without a fee.|$|E
6000|$|Again, {{upon all}} forms of sculptural ornament, the effect of time is such, that if the design be poor, it will enrich it; if overcharged, simplify it; if harsh and violent, soften it; if smooth and obscure, exhibit it; {{whatever}} faults it may have are rapidly disguised, whatever virtue it has still shines and steals out in the mellow light; and this to such an extent, that the artist is always liable to be tempted to the drawing of details in old buildings as of extreme beauty, which look cold and hard in their architectural lines; and I have never yet seen any restoration or cleaned portion of a building whose effect was not inferior to the weathered parts, even to those of which the design had in some parts almost disappeared. On {{the front of the}} church of San Michele at Lucca, the mosaics have fallen out of half the columns, and lie in weedy ruin beneath; in many, the frost has torn large masses of the entire coating away, leaving a scarred unsightly surface. Two of the shafts of the upper star window are eaten entirely away by the sea wind, the rest have lost their proportions, the edges of the arches are hacked into deep hollows, and cast indented shadows on the weed-grown wall. The process has gone too far, and yet I doubt not but that this building is seen to greater advantage now than when first built, always with exception of one circumstance, that the French shattered the lower <b>wheel</b> <b>window,</b> and set up in front of it an escutcheon with [...] "Libertas" [...] upon it, which abomination of desolation, the Lucchese have not yet had human-heartedness enough to pull down.|$|E
60|$|I saw later some {{gentlemen of}} Assisi who also seemed bored {{enough to have}} found {{entertainment}} in his tray. They were {{at the door of}} the cafe on the Piazza, and were so thankful to me for asking them the way to the cathedral that, answering all in chorus, they lighted up with smiles as sympathetic as if I had done them a favour. Of that type were my mild, my delicate adventures. The Piazza has a fine old portico of an ancient Temple of Minerva-- six fluted columns and a pediment, of beautiful proportions, but sadly battered and decayed. Goethe, I believe, found it much more interesting than the mighty mediaeval church, and Goethe, as a cicerone, doubtless could have persuaded one that it was so; but in the humble society of Murray we shall most of us find a richer sense in the later monument. I found quaint old meanings enough in the dark yellow facade of the small cathedral as I sat on a stone bench by the oblong green stretched before it. This is a pleasing piece of Italian Gothic and, like several of its companions at Assisi, has an elegant <b>wheel</b> <b>window</b> and a number of grotesque little carvings of creatures human and bestial. If with Goethe I were to balance anything against the attractions of the double church I should choose the ruined castle on the hill above the town. I had been having glimpses of it all the afternoon at the end of steep street-vistas, and promising myself half-an-hour beside its grey walls at sunset. The sun was very late setting, and my half-hour became a long lounge in the lee of an abutment which arrested the gentle uproar of the wind. The castle is a splendid piece of ruin, perched on the summit of the mountain to whose slope Assisi clings and dropping a pair of stony arms to enclose the little town in its embrace. The city wall, in other words, straggles up the steep green hill and meets the crumbling skeleton of the fortress. On the side off from the town the mountain plunges into a deep ravine, the opposite face of which is formed by the powerful undraped shoulder of Monte Subasio, a fierce reflector of the sun. Gorge and mountain are wild enough, but their frown expires in the teeming softness of the great vale of Umbria. To lie aloft there on the grass, with silver-grey ramparts at one's back and the warm rushing wind in one's ears, and watch the beautiful plain mellow into the tones of twilight, was as exquisite a form of repose as ever fell to a tired tourist's lot.|$|E
30|$|This {{algorithm}} associates {{one or more}} blobs to each cluster, {{because the}} usual case is a moving vehicle generating a single cluster but with many blobs, due to the diversity of its component parts (<b>wheels,</b> <b>windows,</b> body, etc.). All of the parts generate a similar optical flow but different blobs. This algorithm is very efficient as the computation of a rectangle intersection is almost trivial, the result either being void or another rectangle.|$|R
5000|$|Watts Warehouse (1851), now Britannia House, at nos. 35-47 between Minshull Street and Chorlton Street. The architects were Travis & Mangnall {{and each}} floor is {{built in a}} {{different}} architectural style, none of which are Gothic or Classical but [...] "a licentious bit of confectionery in stone, iron, timber and glass".

25|$|Narrow {{doors and}} small windows might be surmounted by a solid stone lintel. Larger {{openings}} are nearly always arched. A characteristic feature of Romanesque architecture, both ecclesiastic and domestic, is the pairing of two arched windows or arcade openings, {{separated by a}} pillar or colonette and often set within a larger arch. Ocular windows are common in Italy, particularly in the facade gable and are also seen in Germany. Later Romanesque churches may have <b>wheel</b> <b>windows</b> or rose windows with plate tracery.|$|R

The circular form, or rose window, developed in France from relatively simple windows with openings pierced through slabs of thin stone to <b>wheel</b> <b>windows,</b> {{as exemplified by}} the west front of Chartres Cathedral, and ultimately to designs of enormous complexity, the tracery being drafted from hundreds of different points, such as those at Sainte-Chapelle, Paris and the [...] "Bishop's Eye" [...] at Lincoln Cathedral.|$|R

This central tower now houses the largest surviving treadwheel crane in England, which used to be used when raising building materials to a workshop located in the roof. A distinctive feature of both the north and south transepts is the presence of <b>wheel</b> <b>windows,</b> with ten equal parts. Tours to the roof space to see the crane and rose windows are available to the general public, subject to other church commitments.|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{represents}} a {{brief review of}} life saving system in roll- over accidents, while driving on the road by a four wheeler. An Airbag is an automotive safety restraint system for an occupant as well as passengers. The system consists of a flexible fabric envelope or cushion, designed to inflate rapidly during an automobile collision. Its purpose is to cushion occupants during a crash and provide protection to their bodies when they strike interior objects such as the steering <b>wheel</b> or a <b>window</b> etc. Thus it lowers the number of injuries by reducing the force exerted by steering <b>wheel,</b> <b>windows</b> and the dashboard at any point on the body. Continuing research and developments are going on in its module design, combustible material, air bag fabric design and material, coating etc. in making this life saving safety device further efficient. However, success of any safety restraint device depends on its correct implementation and certain safety rules to be followed...|$|R

50|$|Christ Church is {{constructed}} in rock-faced stone with ashlar dressings, {{and has a}} slate roof. Its plan consists of a five-bay nave, north and south transepts, a chancel ending in a polygonal apse, north and south vestries, and a porch at the west end. To {{the east of the}} north transept is a turret. In the nave there are two-light windows containing plate tracery. Above the porch at the west end is a four-light window with Geometric tracery, and a small single-light window above it. The transepts contain <b>wheel</b> <b>windows</b> with plate tracery. The windows in the chancel have two lights with Geometrical tracery. The stained glass in the west window, dating from 1893, is by F. Holt.|$|R
