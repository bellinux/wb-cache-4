500|$|The {{film was}} made {{in an attempt to}} {{challenge}} the [...] "no pressure" [...] attitude often displayed both by governments and individuals towards taking real action on climate change. 10:10 highlighted the urgency of action with claims that carbon dioxide emissions must be stabilised by 2014 (within four years) in order to avoid disaster, and that [...] "300,000 real people" [...] are already killed by climate change annually. Lizzie Gillet, 10:10 global campaign director, explained: [...] "With climate change becoming increasingly threatening, and decreasingly talked about in the media, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a way to bring this critical issue back into the headlines while making people laugh. We were therefore delighted when Richard Curtis agreed to write a short film for the 10:10 campaign".|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} then filmed in Budapest, Hungary over several days. [...] "The {{reason for the}} {{location}} stems from the music in the actual video. The ball needs to bounce synchronized with the 16th or 8th beat in the track. To do that, we needed a space with equidistant or closed surfaces to bounce around. A roof low to the floor but with uprights. Obviously parking lots are ideal. So the location thing happened mainly so it wouldn't fly into the sky. Being connoisseurs of parking lots, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a good example. But it was a technical reason that made us go with it," [...] Knight said.

2500|$|Christina Aguilera was {{recorded}} between 1998 and 1999, with Ron Fair {{serving as the}} album's executive producer. The label reportedly spent $1 million on writers, producers and voice lessons. According to Fair, [...] "She {{was very much a}} raw talent, so building a collection of songs that would become her first album was a time-consuming process. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the ones that could knock the door down and put her up there." [...] The album was built around pop songs, which was against Aguilera's will, since she wanted a more R album. She further explained during an interview for The Washington Post: [...] "I was held back a lot from doing more R ad-libbing. They clearly wanted to make a fresh-sounding young pop record and that's not always the direction I wanted to go in. Sometimes they didn't get it, didn't want to hear me out because of my age, and that was a little bit frustrating. Since all the success, it's a little easier to get my opinions across." ...|$|E

[...] Famous songwriter Diane Warren was hired to write material for the album, eventually writing [...] "Somebody's Somebody" [...] and suggested that [...] "I Turn to You", which was written for the [...] "Space Jam soundtrack", would be perfect for her voice. Eventually, Aguilera recorded [...] "I Turn to You" [...] and included it on her self-titled debut album, and the song was chosen as the album's third single. It was sent to U.S. radio on March 30, 2000, while its CD single was released on June 13, 2000. A Spanish version of the song entitled [...] "Por Siempre Tú" [...] was recorded and also released as a single, eventually being included on her first Spanish album, Mi Reflejo.|$|E
2500|$|The Gamemakers' control center, {{about which}} Katniss can only {{speculate}} in the novel, was also developed as a location, helping to remind the audience of the artificial nature of the arena. Ross commented, [...] "so much of the film happens in the woods that it's easy to forget this is a futuristic society, manipulating these events {{for the sake of}} an audience. The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room." [...] Ross and visual effects supervisor Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal dei ex machina Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that [...] "we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [...] that just appear {{at the end of the}} movie? <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a way to introduce them without having to explain specifically and exactly what they were and the game room was a really great opportunity for us to be able to do that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wolverine makes a brief {{appearance}} in [...] as Weapon X. Having somehow been captured by Stryker at some point, {{he has been}} given an adamantium skeleton and subject to brutal mental conditioning, leaving him operating on a more feral state than a human level. When some of the adult X-Men are captured by Stryker's men, Jean, Scott and Kurt Wagner are able to infiltrate Stryker's base and find Logan's cage, with Jean sensing the human mind underneath the conditioning and releasing him {{so that he can}} help. After Weapon X tears his way through Stryker's forces, the three teens find him at a small side-exit to the base, Jean's telepathy to restore some of Logan's human memories before he runs off into the snow. Writer Simon Kinberg explained that the character was originally intended to have a larger role in the film, saying [...] "There was always a notion that we wanted Wolverine to be in the movie. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a way to feature him in the film, partly because Bryan [...] and I love Hugh [...] so much. We love the character, obviously, and he’s such a huge part of the franchise. There were a lot of iterations of how Wolverine would enter and exit the movie. There was a version when he was going to come in at the midpoint of the film and be like the drill sergeant for the kids and take over as their leader. And we felt like that stepped on Jennifer Lawrence's role in the movie and becoming their leader".|$|E

"Why, you see," [...] {{answered}} Pomona, [...] "when Jone an' I was goin' {{to bring}} our baby over here among so many million people, we thought there might be danger of its gittin' lost or mislaid, though we never really believed any such thing would happen, or we wouldn't have come. An' so we agreed to mark her, for I've often read about babies bein' stole an' kept two or three years, and when found bein' so changed their own mothers didn't know 'em. Jone said we'd better tattoo Corinne, for them marks would always be there, but I wouldn't agree to have the little creature's skin stuck with needles, not even after Jone said we might give her chloryform; so we agreed to stamp initials on her with Perkins's Indelible Dab. It is intended to mark sheep, but it don't hurt, and it don't never come off. We put the letters {{on the back of}} her heels, where they wouldn't show, for she's never to go barefoot, an' where they'd be easy got at if <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> 'em.

6000|$|For, as an {{eruption}} ceases, the melted lava cools in the vents, and hardens; usually into lava infinitely {{harder than the}} ash-cone round it; and this, when the ash-cone is washed off, remains as the highest part of the hill, as in the Mont Dore and the Cantal in France, and in several extinct volcanoes in the Antilles. Of course the lava must have been poured out, and the ashes blown out from some vents or other, connected with the nether world of fire; probably from many successive vents. For in volcanoes, when one vent is choked, another is wont to open at some fresh point of least resistance among the overlying rocks. But where are these vents? Buried deep under successive eruptions, shifted probably from their places by successive upheavings and dislocations; and if <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> them we should have to quarry the mountain range all over, a mile deep, before we hit upon {{here and there a}} tap-root of ancient lava, connecting the upper and the nether worlds. There are such tap- roots, probably, under each of our British mountain ranges. But Snowdon, certainly, does not owe its shape to the fact of one of these old fire vents being under it. It owes its shape simply to the accident of some of the beds toward the summit being especially hard, and thus able to stand the wear and tear of sea-wave, ice, and rain. [...] Its lakes have been formed quite regardless of the lie of the rocks, though not regardless of their relative hardness. But what forces scooped them out--whether they were originally holes left in the ground by earthquakes, and deepened since by rain and rivers, or whether they were scooped out by ice, or by any other means, is a question on which the best geologists are yet undecided--decided only on this--that craters they are not.|$|E

6000|$|In other words, we {{have not}} found St. George; but we have found the Dragon. We have found in the desert, as I have said, {{the bones of the}} monster we did not believe in, more plainly than the {{footprints}} of the hero we did. We have found them not because we expected to find them, for our progressive minds look to the promise of something much brighter and even better; not because <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> them, for our modern mood, as well as our human nature, is entirely in favour of more amiable and reassuring things; not because we thought it even possible to find them, for we really thought it impossible so far as we ever thought of it at all. We have found them because they are there; and we are bound to come on them even by falling over them. It is Huxley's method that has upset Huxley's conclusion. As I have said, that conclusion itself is completely reversed. What he thought indisputable is disputed; and what he thought impossible is possible. Instead of Christian morals surviving in the form of humanitarian morals, Christian demonology has survived in the form of heathen demonology. But it has not survived by scholarly traditionalism in the style of Gladstone, but rather by obstinate objective curiosity according to the advice of Huxley. We in the West have [...] "followed our reason as far as it would go," [...] and our reason has led us to things that nearly all the rationalists would have thought wildly irrational. Science was supposed to bully us into being rationalists; but it is now supposed to be bullying us into being irrationalists. The science of Einstein might rather be called following our unreason as far as it will go, seeing whether the brain will crack under the conception that space is curved, or that parallel straight lines always meet. And the science of Freud would make it essentially impossible to say how far our reason or unreason does go, or where it stops. For if a man is ignorant of his other self, how can he possibly know that the other self is ignorant? He can no longer say with pride that at least he knows that he knows nothing. That is exactly what he does not know. The floor has fallen out of his mind and the abyss below may contain subconscious certainties as well as subconscious doubts. He is too ignorant even to ignore; and he must confess himself an agnostic about whether he is an agnostic.|$|E
