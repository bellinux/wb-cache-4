25|$|Protestants {{concentrate}} {{mainly in}} three regions: Henan, Anhui and Zhejiang. In these provinces the Christian population {{is in the}} millions, yet small in percentage. For instance, in Zhejiang 2.8% {{of the population is}} officially Protestant as of 1999, higher than the national average. In Wenzhou, a city of Zhejiang, about one million people (approximately 11%) are Christians, the highest concentration in one city. The Protestant population consists predominantly of illiterate or semi-illiterate people, elderly people and women. These characteristics are confirmed by the findings of the Yu Tao survey of 2008, which also found that Protestantism has the lowest proportion of believers <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time members of the Communist Party of China in comparison to other religions, and by the Chinese Family Panel Studies' survey of 2012.|$|E
25|$|High {{levels of}} {{immunity}} in one age group can create herd immunity for other age groups. Vaccinating adults against pertussis reduces pertussis incidence in infants {{too young to}} be vaccinated, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> greatest risk of complications from the disease. This is especially important for close family members, who account for most of the transmissions to young infants. In the same manner, children receiving vaccines against pneumococcus reduces pneumococcal disease incidence among younger, unvaccinated siblings. Conversely, vaccinating children against pneumococcus and rotavirus has had the effect of reducing pneumococcus- and rotavirus-attributable hospitalizations for older children and adults, who do not normally receive these vaccines. Influenza (flu) is more severe in the elderly than in younger age groups, but influenza vaccines lack effectiveness in this demographic due to a waning of the immune system with age. The prioritization of school-age children for seasonal flu immunization, which is more effective than vaccinating the elderly, however, has shown to create a certain degree of herd immunity for the elderly.|$|E

500|$|Brain {{trauma is}} one of the strongest predisposing factors for {{epilepsy}} development, and is an especially important factor in young adults. [...] Young adults, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> highest risk for head injury, also have the highest rate of PTE, which is the largest cause of new-onset epilepsy cases in young people. Children have a lower risk for developing epilepsy; 10% of children with severe TBI and 16–20% of similarly injured adults develop PTE. Being older than 65 is also a predictive factor in the development of epilepsy after brain trauma. One study found PTE to be more common in male TBI survivors than in females.|$|E

2500|$|In 1884, Japan had {{encouraged}} a coup in Korea by a pro-Japanese reformist faction, {{which led to}} the conservative government calling upon China for help, leading to a clash between Chinese and Japanese soldiers in Seoul. At the time, Tokyo did not feel ready to risk a war with China, and the crisis was ended by the Treaty of Tintsin, which left Korea more strongly in the Chinese sphere of influence, though it did give the Japanese the right to intervene in Korea. All through the 1880s and early 1890s, the government in Tokyo was regularly criticized for not being aggressive enough in Korea, leading a Japanese historian Masao Maruyama to write: [...] "Just as Japan was subject to pressure from the Great Powers, so she would apply pressure to still weaker countries-a clear case of the transfer psychology. In this regard it is significant that ever since the Meiji period demands for a tough foreign policy have come from the common people, that is, from those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> receiving end of oppression at home".|$|E

2500|$|Disrupted {{healthcare}} sectors is a {{term the}} World Health Organization describes for medical facilities that are destroyed or partially destroyed in war torn areas. Health care facilities are essential {{for the establishment of}} support systems for rape victims. Psychological support units are also hampered by the lack of material resources available to the medical community on-ground. Medical practitioners and health-care workers face daunting challenges in conflict and post-conflict area. As the WHO explains, [...] "healthcare delivery fragments and deteriorates, memory and knowledge are eroded, and power disperses". War-torn societies in immediate post-conflict zones have broken medical infrastructure such as: destroyed or partially destroyed hospitals (or clinics); non-functioning hospitals; poor, scarce or inadequate medical supplies, lack of running water, and scarce or lack of electricity. Dismantling weapons from armed rebels and other groups are prioritized in immediate post-conflict situations which in effect de-prioritizes the immediate physical and psychiatric care that war rape victims are in urgent need of. [...] "If {{we do not have the}} capacity to prevent war, we have a collective responsibility to better understand and treat its psychiatric, medical, and social consequences." [...] Access to phycological health services further causes inequity for survivors of war rape <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> margins of society living in chronic poverty or located in rural regions. Healthcare and psychiatric care is a key component to the healing processes of war rape.|$|E
2500|$|The {{author of}} an article, {{the history of}} {{education}} spending in Pakistan since 1972, argues that this policy target raises a fundamental question: What extraordinary {{things are going to}} happen that would enable Pakistan to achieve within six years what it has been unable to lay a hand on in the past six decades? The policy document is blank on this question and does not discuss the assumptions that form the basis of this target. Calculations of the author show that during the past 37 years, the highest public expenditure on education was 2.80 percent of GDP in 1987-88. Public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP was actually reduced in 16 years and maintained in 5 years between 1972–73 and 2008-09. Thus, out of total 37 years since 1972, public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP either decreased or remained stagnant for 21 years. The author argues if linear trend were maintained since 1972, Pakistan could have touched 4 percent of GDP well before 2015. However, it is unlikely to happen because the levels of spending have had remained significantly unpredictable and unsteady in the past. Given this disappointing trajectory, increasing public expenditure on education to 7 percent of GDP would be nothing less than a miracle but {{it is not going to}} be of godly nature. Instead, it is going to be the one of political nature because it has to be [...] "invented" [...] by those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> helm of affairs. The author suggests that little success can be made unless Pakistan adopts an [...] "unconventional" [...] approach to education. That is to say, education sector should be treated as a special sector by immunizing budgetary allocations for it from fiscal stresses and political and economic instabilities. Allocations for education should not be affected by squeezed fiscal space or surge in military expenditure or debts. At the same time, there is a need to debate others options about how Pakistan can [...] "invent" [...] the miracle of raising education expenditure to 7 percent of GDP by 2015.|$|E
