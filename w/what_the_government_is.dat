25|$|Goldstein's book {{explains}} {{that the purpose of}} the unwinnable, perpetual war is to consume human labour and commodities so that the economy of a superstate cannot support economic equality, with a high standard of life for every citizen. By using up most of the produced objects like boots and rations, the proles are kept poor and uneducated and will neither realise <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> doing nor rebel. Goldstein also details an Oceanian strategy of attacking enemy cities with atomic rockets before invasion but dismisses it as unfeasible and contrary to the war's purpose; despite the atomic bombing of cities in the 1950s, the superstates stopped it for fear that would imbalance the powers. The military technology in the novel differs little from that of World War II, but strategic bomber aeroplanes are replaced with rocket bombs, helicopters were heavily used as weapons of war (they did not figure in World War II in any form but prototypes) and surface combat units have been all but replaced by immense and unsinkable Floating Fortresses, island-like contraptions concentrating the firepower of a whole naval task force in a single, semi-mobile platform (in the novel, one is said to have been anchored between Iceland and the Faroe Islands, suggesting a preference for sea lane interdiction and denial).|$|E

While the Obama administration has made some modest improvements to the rules governing classification of government information, both it and the Bush administration have overclassified and kept secret information that should be subject to public scrutiny and debate.

Assange is shown to be living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London to avoid arrest on an outstanding warrant for alleged sex crimes. In an interview, he denounces the two upcoming WikiLeaks films, stating that they will be factually inaccurate (having been partly based on Daniel's book).

[...] He advised the Canadian Forces command that they could be [...] "criminally negligent" [...] if they were to transfer detainees to a risk of torture in Afghan hands. Watkin declined to answer questions on the basis of solicitor-client privilege when called to testify in Canada's House of Commons, saying that the privilege owed to the Government of Canada prevented him answering a number of the House's questions.

The Office of the Chancellor of Justice said that, although, the government can not criticize the decision to publish, it might go further in its criticism of the article without violating the Constitution, although that might be [...] "inappropriate".

2500|$|Burke's {{change from}} the letter to Fitzwilliam to the Letters on a Regicide Peace showed him turning to address <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> doing in terms of peace.

Although the letter was supposed to deal with an event happening at the moment, the delay disrupted its timeliness. The published letters were able to convince [...] The Gentleman's Magazine, which stated that such a peace would be impossible. Burke's stance on the French Revolution was similar to Fitzwilliam's, and the two advocated for their mutual position, which included a restoration of the French monarchy and the sense that a peace with France would be a humiliation and a defeat for Britain.|$|R
50|$|The ACR-1000 was {{introduced}} as a lower-priced option {{compared to a}} larger version of the CANDU design then being considered, the CANDU-9. ACR was slightly larger but less expensive to build and run. The downside was {{that it did not}} have the flexibility of fuels that the original CANDU design offered, and would no longer run on pure unenriched uranium. This was {{a small price to pay}} given the low cost of enrichment services and fuel in general. AECL bid the ACR-1000 on several proposals around the world but won no contests. The last serious proposal was for a two-reactor expansion of the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station, but this project was cancelled in 2009 when the price was estimated to <b>be</b> three times <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> budgetting.|$|R
