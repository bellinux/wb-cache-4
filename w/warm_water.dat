5|$|Environmental hazards {{induced by}} humans also puts {{sirenians}} at risk. Sirenians, especially the West Indian manatee, face high mortality from watercraft collision, {{and about half}} of all West Indian manatee deaths are caused by watercraft collisions. An increased usage of hydroelectric power and subsequent damming of rivers increase waterway traffic, which can lead to vessel collisions, and manatees may become entangled in navigational locks. The urbanized coastline of areas such as the Caribbean and Australia can result in the decline of seagrass populations. Reliable areas of <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> in Florida are generally the result of discharge from power plants, but newer plants with more efficient cooling systems may disrupt the pattern of <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> refuges, and an increased demand for artesian springs for water, the natural source of <b>warm</b> <b>water,</b> decreases the number of <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> refuges. Sirenians can be caught as bycatch from fisheries, and they can be seen as pests with the interference of local fishermen and the destruction of their nets. African manatees have also been known to venture into rice paddies and destroy the crops during the rainy season, and these confrontations with locals may lead to intentional culling of the manatees.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics {{in several different}} ways. One such way is if it moves over land, thus depriving it of the <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> it needs to power itself, quickly losing strength. Most strong storms lose their strength very rapidly after landfall and become disorganized areas of low pressure {{within a day or}} two, or evolve into extra{{tropical cyclone}}s. There is a chance a tropical cyclone could regenerate if it managed to get back over open <b>warm</b> <b>water,</b> such as with Hurricane Ivan. If it remains over mountains for even a short time, weakening will accelerate. Many storm fatalities occur in mountainous terrain, when diminishing cyclones unleash their moisture as torrential rainfall. This rainfall may lead to deadly floods and mudslides, {{as was the case with}} Hurricane Mitch around Honduras in October 1998. Without warm surface water, the storm cannot survive.|$|E

5|$|A steam {{devil is}} a {{rotating}} updraft between 50 and 200 meters wide that involves steam or smoke.

Hot springs and deserts may also be suitable locations for a tighter, faster-rotating steam devil to form. The phenomenon can occur over water, when cold arctic air passes over relatively <b>warm</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

5|$|Located at the {{southern}} periphery of a subtropical ridge, Iniki continued westward and strengthened over the unusually favorable central Pacific; it reached hurricane status on September 9 while 470miles (760km) south-southeast of Hilo. The subtropical ridge, which typically keeps hurricanes {{well away from the}} Hawaiian Islands, weakened due to an approaching upper level-trough and allowed Iniki to turn to the northwest. With very favorable upper-level outflow and <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> temperatures, Iniki steadily intensified, and attained major hurricane status on September 10 while south-southwest of the island chain.|$|E

5|$|North American forecasters, however {{surprised}} as they were, considered this storm a hurricane immediately upon reviewing the satellite-derived evidence.

5|$|Smoke was not {{the only}} thing emitted from the power station. In July 1956, the {{discharge}} of cooling water from the stations was noted to have increased the water temperature of the river by 1.5°C between Ryton and Scotswood. However, this was found to not be too deleterious, as it did not seem to affect the passage of migratory fish. In fact, because of the stations' introduction of <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> into the river, basking sharks were known to be attracted to the area.|$|E
5|$|A mid-level ridge over Mexico {{caused the}} cyclone to track {{steadily}} northwestward. With <b>warm</b> <b>water</b> temperatures and low vertical wind shear, the depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Ileana. Convection developed and organized into a central dense overcast, and with abundant low-level moisture, rapid deepening was expected. An eye {{formed in the}} center of the convection, and Ileana attained hurricane status late on August22. On August23, about 48hours after forming, Ileana reached major hurricane status and a peak intensity of 120mph (195km/h) about 60mi (100km) southeast of Socorro Island. It also attained an atmospheric pressure of 955mbar, as well as an eye diameter of 23mi (37km).|$|E
