5|$|During 1939 and 1940, {{a fourth}} batch of ten {{locomotives}} (Nos. 6235–6244) {{was built in}} streamlined form commencing with No. 6235 City of Birmingham. The names of cities for the locomotives {{would seem to have}} been adopted because the LMS <b>was</b> <b>fast</b> running out of names of Duchesses. These locomotives cost an average of £10,659 for the first five and £10,838 each for the second five. The names of the cities in this batch were in strict alphabetical order. This came to an end when No. 6244 City of Leeds was patriotically renamed King George VI in 1941.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, Messrs. Wood and Street, from Richmond, Va., {{found their}} way to Kentucky. Friendly {{considerations}} led me to patronize them. This was done through the solicitations of a young friend from Virginia. They commenced a paper, published in 1806, called the 'Western World.' Imbibing strong prejudices against slavery, perhaps from my mother's repeating, in my infancy, the nurse's songs composed by Cowper, designed to make such impressions. In June 1806, to the great astonishment of my friends, I left Kentucky, with all the flattering prospects a youth could have, and hastened to Ohio. Connecting circumstances, and from hints that fell from Wood and others, a deep impression had been made on my mind, that an eventful period <b>was</b> <b>fast</b> approaching.|$|E
5|$|In February 1959, formal {{authority}} for beginning construction was granted. However, while Menzies was on holiday, some {{officials from the}} Department of Treasury convinced ministers to withhold money needed for the lake, so {{the start of the}} construction was delayed. Once it started, progress <b>was</b> <b>fast.</b> At its peak, the number of people physically working on the construction in the lakes was between 400 and 500. John Overall, the Commissioner of the NCDC, promised Menzies that the work would be finished within four years, and he succeeded, despite the Prime Minister's scepticism. Equipment was quickly requisitioned.|$|E

5|$|Johnson was {{the second}} son of Rebecca Turner Johnson and John Johnson, a Baptist yeoman who lived in Everton, Liverpool. Religious Dissent marked Johnson from the {{beginning}} of his life, as two of his mother's relatives were prominent Baptist ministers and his father was a deacon. Liverpool, at the time of Johnson's youth, <b>was</b> <b>fast</b> becoming a bustling urban centre {{and was one of the}} most important commercial ports in England. These two characteristics of his home—Dissent and commercialism—remained central elements in Johnson's character throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he <b>was</b> <b>fast</b> for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E
5|$|Kim Collins {{competed in}} his fifth {{consecutive}} Olympic Games, {{and was the}} oldest sprinter at these Games. While most sprinters peak in their 20s, Collins set his personal record after reaching the age of 40, {{and became the first}} individual to run a sub-10 second 100m dash in the process. He ran a 9.93 100m dash, which <b>was</b> <b>fast</b> enough to qualify for Rio. He competed in both the 100m sprint and 4 × 100m relay. Collins was the only St. Kitts and Nevis athlete to make it out of the first round. He finished his heat with a time of 10.18 and fourth place. He improved his time in the semifinals, finishing with a time of 10.12. This put him in sixth place and he did not advance to the finals.|$|E

5|$|Kim Collins, {{the only}} man from St. Kitts and Nevis to compete in an {{individual}} event, competed in both the 100 m sprint and the 4 × 100 m relay {{at the age of}} 20. He finished the first heat of the 100 m sprint in third place with a time of 10.27, which <b>was</b> <b>fast</b> enough to qualify him for the quarterfinals. Collins ran a little slower in the second heat—finishing with a time of 10.34—which was not sufficient to qualify for the semifinals.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the {{preference}} toward airships, several small merchant vessels were converted into seaplane carriers during World War I. They carried only {{two to four}} aircraft each, however, and were too slow to operate with the High Seas Fleet. The light cruiser , which <b>was</b> <b>fast</b> enough to steam with the Fleet, was converted into a seaplane carrier in 1918. She too, though, only carried two seaplanes. It was decided to convert the liner Ausonia into a flight-deck carrier for wheeled aircraft as well as floatplanes. The plan for the conversion was drawn up by Leutnant zur See Jürgen Reimpell in 1918, {{an officer of the}} 1st Aviation Detachment.|$|E

In addition to his fiction prose output, Savage published collections of his speeches and essays, and in 1895 wrote a book of poetry dedicated to his wife: After Many Years. Savage's writing style <b>was</b> <b>fast</b> and precise: he wrote from morning to night and rarely needed to correct his first drafts. He was able {{to carry on a}} conversation while writing. He joined the Author's Guild of America in 1894.|$|E

5|$|The La-7 {{ended the}} superiority in {{vertical}} maneuverability that the Messerschmitt Bf 109G had previously enjoyed over other Soviet fighters. Furthermore, it <b>was</b> <b>fast</b> enough at low altitudes to catch, albeit with some difficulties, Focke Wulf Fw 190 fighter-bombers that attacked Soviet units on the frontlines and immediately returned to German-controlled airspace at full speed. The Yakovlev Yak-3 and the Yakovlev Yak-9U with the Klimov VK-107 engine lacked {{a large enough}} margin of speed to overtake the German raiders. 115 La-7s were lost in air combat, only half the number of Yak-3s.|$|E
5|$|By the 38th lap, {{drivers who}} made their stops during the safety car period entered into their {{electrical}} energy conservation phase. Andretti chose {{to allow their}} drivers {{to remain on the}} circuit {{for as long as possible}} and their strategy allowed Félix da Costa and Frijns to catch and overtake d'Ambrosio and Turvey for the fifth and sixth positions in the event's closing period. Félix da Costa then attempted to catch the fourth-placed Prost but was unable to get close to him. As the field began the final lap, di Grassi, Heidfeld and Prost had five percent of usage electrical energy remaining and Buemi was unchallenged for the remainder of the race to secure the victory. Di Grassi finished second, ahead of Heidfeld in third. Prost was fourth and Félix da Costa fifth. Frijns, d'Ambrosio, Turvey, Engel and Sarrazin rounded out the top ten points-scoring positions. Piquet, Carroll filled the next two positions. Bird <b>was</b> <b>fast</b> enough to unlap himself by passing the race leaders, despite spinning his tyres at the circuit's low-speed exit turns, and finished in 13th. Duval and Rosenqvist were the last of the classified finishers. It was Buemi's first victory of the season and the seventh of his career. There were three lead changes in the race; four drivers reached the front of the field. Buemi led once for a total of 20 laps, more than any other competitor. Of the two other retirements, Vergne stopped with an overheating battery, and Abt lost all electrical energy in his car after 34 laps.|$|E
