5|$|The family {{received}} the video from Capaldi on 3 November 2014. After viewing the video, Thomas felt encouraged to attend his grandmother's funeral. In {{an interview with}} The Guardian, Ross Goodall explained that Capaldi's mention of sadness resonated with the child due to his experience of grief over his grandmother's death. He discussed {{the manner in which}} Thomas perceived emotions as a strict dichotomy between positive and negative without a middle ground. Thomas interpreted from the video that it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> to feel happy while simultaneously acknowledging that a sad event had occurred. Ross Goodall told The Guardian that before viewing the video from Capaldi, his son had not wanted to attend the funeral.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, a {{campaign}} to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., who {{was concerned about the}} image of the city in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible. Entrapment usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or the officer bought the man a drink—he was arrested for solicitation. One story in the New York Post described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed his crotch, moaning, and a man who asked him if he <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> was arrested. Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{continued}} to the pedestrian gate where he stabbed the officer controlling the gate, and two officers {{who had just}} entered the prison. This incident was seen by a soldier on duty in a watch tower, who reported to the British Army operations room {{that he had seen}} prison officers fighting. The operations room telephoned the prison's Emergency Control Room (ECR), which replied that everything <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> and that an alarm had been accidentally triggered earlier. At 4:12 pm the alarm was raised when an officer in the gatehouse pushed the prisoner holding him hostage {{out of the room and}} telephoned the ECR. However, this was not done soon enough to prevent the escape. After several attempts the prisoners had opened the main gate, and were waiting for the prisoners still in the gatehouse to rejoin them in the lorry. At this time two prison officers blocked the exit with their cars, forcing the prisoners to abandon the lorry and make their way to the outer fence which was 25 yards away. Four prisoners attacked one of the officers and hijacked his car, which they drove towards the external gate. They crashed into a car near the gate and abandoned the car. Two escaped through the gate, one was captured exiting the car, and another was captured after being chased by a soldier. At the main gate, a prison officer was shot in the leg while chasing the only two prisoners who had not yet reached the outer fence. The prisoner who fired the shot was captured after being shot and wounded by a soldier in a watch tower, and the other prisoner was captured after falling. The other prisoners escaped over the fence, and by 4:18 pm the main gate was closed and the prison secured, after 35 prisoners had breached the prison perimeter. The escape was the biggest in both British and Irish history, and the biggest in Europe since World War II.|$|E

25|$|As a {{conservative}} Christian, Boone declined certain songs and movie roles {{that he felt}} might compromise his beliefs—including a role with sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. In {{one of his first}} films, April Love, the director, Henry Levin, wanted him to give co-star Shirley Jones a kiss (which was not in the script).

O'Leary left Chicago immediately, but returned two weeks later, learned that Loeser and others had been arrested, phoned Piquett, who assured him everything <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> then left again.

25|$|His {{adoptive father}} was a {{hard-working}} coal miner, but the family still had trouble making ends meet. Gavin quit school after eighth grade and became a full-time clerk at a shoe store for $12.50 a week. His next stint was as a manager for Jewel Oil Company. A combination of restlessness and limited future opportunities in his hometown caused Gavin {{to run away from}} home. In March 1924, on his 17th birthday, he took the night train to New York. The first thing he did upon arriving was to send a telegram to his parents saying everything <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> to prevent them from reporting him missing to the police. After that, he started looking for a job.|$|E
25|$|At 1030 {{hours on}} the morning of 24 November Seneca hailed Tomoka in {{latitude}} 40° 21.6' North, longitude 73° 49.7' West and ordered her to heave to and be prepared to be boarded and examined. A surfboat with an armed boarding party in charge of Lieutenant L. W. Perkins was sent to go on board and take charge of the vessel. At first Tomoka broke out the British flag and cruised about so that the boarding party would not overtake her. Seneca called her gun crews to quarters, cast loose the number one gun, and then ordered Tomoka to permit the boat to board. The master then complied. At 12:00 the boarding officer reported that he <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> and requested the Seneca to go ahead and he would follow with Tomoka. Seneca shaped a course for the Ambrose Channel lightship, but by 12:30 Tomoka had still not started to follow. Heading back for the rum-runner Seneca was met by her boarding party, which had been chased off Tomoka with a machinegun.|$|E
25|$|Jimmy Lauderdale, on 139, {{was a bit}} {{puzzled by}} all this. But they were all new to the four-track, and he {{supposed}} it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> Then the signalman gave them a green flag from the box, so Lauderdale started pulling forward {{to see what he}} wanted. But the guard had spotted the down signals all off; thoroughly alarmed, he began running forward and shouting, and presently Lauderdale heard him and stopped. But it was too late then to do anything. The express was 200 yards away, coming 40 miles an hour. No. 139's crew cleared out and went over the wall, and the express went head on into 139. It was quite a bad smash. The guard and two passengers were killed. The fireman and another passenger died later. The driver escaped with severe bruising. There was very nearly another collision immediately after, for a Caley mineral from Lesmahagow was coming on the Down Goods line. Its driver saw the crash occur and managed to pull up just in time.|$|E

When asked about Casares, defensive end Ed O'Bradovich stated, [...] "Oh my God, I think when you talk to my fellow teammates over here, what <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>right,</b> true and good about professional football was embodied in Rick Casares.

500|$|On 20 July 1976, {{childhood}} friends Sumner and Hook separately {{attended a}} Sex Pistols {{show at the}} Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall. The following day Hook borrowed £35 from his mother to buy his first bass guitar. Sumner later said that {{he felt that the}} Pistols [...] "destroyed the myth of being a pop star, of a musician being some kind of god that you had to worship". Inspired by the performance, Sumner and Hook formed a band with their friend Terry Mason, who had also attended the show. Sumner bought a guitar, and Mason a drum kit. They invited schoolfriend Martin Gresty to join as vocalist, but he turned them down after getting a job at a local factory. An advertisement was placed in the Virgin Records shop in Manchester for a vocalist. Ian Curtis, who knew them from earlier gigs, responded and was hired without audition.
