Its base at Nadzab was {{surrounded}} by mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions that had to take off after dark, {{but there was no}} such problem at Saidor. During March, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia. A raid on Hollandia on 16 April 1944 encountered a <b>weather</b> <b>front</b> that closed Nadzab and the other fields in the Markham Valley. More than 30 aircraft made their way to Saidor. An F-5 Lightning and a B-25 Mitchell collided on the runway, and two aircraft cracked up on landing, but the other aircraft that made it to Saidor eventually returned to their bases.|$|E
5|$|The symbols {{used for}} clouds emulate the cloud shape. Cirrus is {{indicated}} by a couple hooks, cumulus are indicated by a mound shape, with cumulonimbus indicated with an upside down trapezoid {{on top of the}} cumulus symbol to indicate its anvil. When {{there is more than one}} cloud type present per level, the cloud type with the highest priority is included. Knowing the cloud type at various locations can help determine whether or not a <b>weather</b> <b>front</b> has passed by a particular location. A low deck of stratus could indicate a station is still north of a warm front, while thunderstorms can indicate the approach of a squall line or cold front.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Bret was {{the second}} named storm of the 2011 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season. Bret formed along the southwestern periphery of a <b>weather</b> <b>front</b> north of the Bahamas on July 17. At first, the storm moved little and gradually strengthened in response to favorable upper-level conditions, reaching peak sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h). Steering currents in the area subsequently became better established, and Bret turned toward the northeast only to encounter {{a substantial increase in}} vertical wind shear. Despite the shear, the storm maintained a well-defined wind circulation for several days, with intermittent bursts of thunderstorms near its center. By July 22, Bret had been devoid of strong thunderstorm activity for several hours, prompting the National Hurricane Center to discontinue public advisories when it was located about 375miles (605km) north of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Wake lows form due to {{adiabatic}} warming {{in the wake}} of mature squall lines at the back edge of their rain shields, where evaporative cooling is unable to offset warming due to atmospheric subsidence, or downward motion. They can be caused by gravity waves which duct through boundary layers which are deep and cold to the north of a <b>weather</b> <b>front.</b> As with mesoscale high-pressure areas behind a squall line, when new thunderstorm development stops along the squall line, the wake low will weaken as well. Clearing conditions will accompany the wake low, due to the descending warm air mass associated with the feature. Within the United States, these systems have been observed to form in the Mississippi river valley, Southeast, Florida, and Great Plains.|$|E
5|$|Crossing {{over the}} central Philippines and the Sibuyan Sea, Tropical Storm Dot grew {{in size and}} intensity. By June7, the storm entered the South China Sea and {{acquired}} a brief northerly component to its track. At the time, forecasters at the JTWC anticipated that Dot would interact with an approaching <b>weather</b> <b>front</b> and track north of Hainan Island. The front failed to materialize, however, and the storm resumed a west-northwesterly track. Owing to low wind shear and warm waters, Dot attained typhoon status on June8. Following {{the development of an}} eye, the storm reached its peak intensity later that day as a Category3 equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 185km/h (115mph). By the morning of June9, the JMA assessed Dot to have attained ten-minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph) and a barometric pressure of 955mbar (hPa; 28.2inHg).|$|E

5|$|On September 22, the cyclone {{intensified}} {{to attain}} Category 2 strength, {{and became a}} major hurricane of Category 3 status shortly thereafter as it turned towards the northeast. Several ships penetrated the storm's center during its passage through the gulf. The hurricane also moved over two experimental buoys which recorded data on the storm, aiding meteorologists in their forecasts. Hurricane Eloise continued to strengthen until it reached its peak winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of about 955 mbar (hPa; 28.2 inHg). It moved ashore along the Florida Panhandle near Panama City on September 23. Shortly after making landfall, the hurricane rapidly degenerated. Just six hours later, it had weakened into a tropical storm, while situated over eastern Alabama. It further weakened into a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on September 24. The depression transitioned into an extratropical storm over Virginia, and became indistinguishable by later that same day. The remnant moisture, however, merged with a <b>weather</b> <b>front</b> to produce widespread and heavy precipitation.|$|E
5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus fibratus species, this usually indicates an approaching <b>weather</b> <b>front.</b> If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E

25|$|There {{were also}} {{unexpected}} challenges to cope with: In November, 1997, an El Niño <b>weather</b> <b>front</b> dumped {{two inches of}} rain in two hours, flooding the NIF site with 200,000 gallons of water just {{three days before the}} scheduled concrete foundation pour. The earth was so soaked that the framing for the retaining wall sank six inches, forcing the crew to disassemble and reassemble it in order to pour the concrete. Construction was halted in December, 1997, when 16,000-year-old mammoth bones were discovered on the construction site. Paleontologists were called in to remove and preserve the bones, and construction restarted within four days.|$|E
25|$|At around 20:00 UTC, an area {{of strong}} convection, {{including}} cold cloud tops, developed {{near the center of}} circulation. The burst of thunderstorms may have been related to an approaching trough. Tropical Depression Sixteen-E continued moving towards the coast of Mexico, and at 00:00 UTC on October 26, it reached its lowest barometric pressure of 1004 mbar (hPa; 29.65 inHg). It crossed the southwestern Gulf of California before moving ashore between Guasave and Topolobampo. The deteriorating cyclone moved inland, and the last advisory was issued by the NHC on the storm shortly thereafter. Although the storm dissipated at 18:00 UTC, its remnants persisted as they moved across northern Mexico. The system interacted with a <b>weather</b> <b>front</b> in the southwestern United States and triggered thunderstorms there.|$|E

500|$|A similar {{phenomenon}} to a <b>weather</b> <b>front</b> is the dry line, {{which is}} the boundary between air masses with significant moisture differences.

[...] Near the surface during daylight hours, warm moist air is denser than dry air of greater temperature, and thus the warm moist air wedges under the drier air like a cold front. [...] At higher altitudes, the warm moist air is less dense than the dry air and the boundary slope reverses. In the vicinity of the reversal aloft, severe weather is possible, especially when a triple point is formed with a cold front. [...] A weaker form of the dry line seen more commonly is the lee trough, which displays weaker differences in moisture.
