5|$|The area a pride {{occupies}} {{is called}} a pride area, whereas that by a nomad is a range. The males associated with a pride tend {{to stay on the}} fringes, patrolling their territory. Why sociality – the most pronounced in any cat species – has developed in lionesses is the subject of much debate. Increased hunting success appears an obvious reason, but this is less than sure upon examination: coordinated hunting does allow for more successful predation but also ensures that non-hunting members reduce per capita calorific intake; however, some take a role raising cubs, who may be left alone for extended periods of time. Members of the pride regularly tend to play the same role in hunts and hone their skills. The health of the hunters is the primary need for the survival of the pride, and they are the first to consume the prey at the site it is taken. Other benefits include possible kin selection (better to share food with a related lion than <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger),</b> protection of the young, maintenance of territory, and individual insurance against injury and hunger.|$|E

25|$|Stereotypes can be {{a source}} of {{heuristic}} attributes. In a face-to-face conversation <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>stranger,</b> judging their intelligence is more computationally complex than judging the colour of their skin. So if the subject has a stereotype about the relative intelligence of whites, blacks, and Asians, that racial attribute might substitute for the more intangible attribute of intelligence. The pre-conscious, intuitive nature of attribute substitution explains how subjects can be influenced by the stereotype while thinking that they have made an honest, unbiased evaluation of the other person's intelligence.|$|E
