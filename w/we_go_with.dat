They had worked on the series throughout the first season, with their role ranging from directly writing episodes to advising the others on scientific concepts. Whitman later explained that they [...] "come to us with questions: Is this possible? Where can <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> this? Then we go and read the very technical articles, or talk with scientists, and then translate that into the storytelling medium of our show." [...] For [...] "The Road Not Taken", he and Chiappetta were asked to again [...] "find a new and gruesome way to blow people up," [...] this time by rooting it in the concept of pyrokinesis. Chiappetta explained, [...] "They wanted to have someone spontaneously combust and burn up. So this is where we sort of leaned back into our mythology." ...|$|E
500|$|Article 9(1) {{embodies the}} concept of the rule of law, an early {{expression}} of which was the 39th article of the Magna Carta of 1215: [...] "No [...] shall be taken captive or imprisoned, or deprived of his lands, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any way destroyed, nor will <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> force against him nor send forces against him, except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land." [...] Article 9(1) is similar, but by no means identical, to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which prohibits any state from denying [...] "any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law", and to Article 21 of the Constitution of India which states: [...] "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law." [...] Article 5(1) of the Constitution of Malaysia and Singapore's Article 9(1) are worded {{the same way as the}} latter was adopted in 1965 from the former following Singapore's independence from Malaysia.|$|E
500|$|Bono {{agreed to}} Carter's request without asking {{the rest of}} the band, and when {{informed}} of the idea, the other members gave only tacit approval. They briefly considered playing an impromptu concert in the city, with Bono suggesting that they perform in the bunker where Carter and his friends hid during the siege. He said, [...] "even if all we get is some extra attention for Bosnia on MTV, that's something". The idea fell through when it was pointed out that the logistics of transporting their equipment into the city were impossible, as the only way into Sarajevo was on a United Nations plane. Manager Paul McGuinness realized that even if the band managed to organize a concert, it would endanger their lives and those of the audience and the Zoo TV crew. As he explained, [...] "U2's effort to discuss any humanitarian issue have sometimes been accompanied by a false instinct that U2 is also obliged to resolve that issue. Going to Sarajevo seems to me to fall into that category. I think it would endanger the people <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>with,</b> endanger the tour, and endanger the band." [...] Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. feared that the move would look like a publicity stunt.|$|E

2500|$|News {{of future}} series and {{specials}} has been inconsistent, with some cast members often speculating about more material whilst others deny it. Once the third series was completed, Corden and Jones categorically ruled out making any future {{series of the}} show. Corden said [...] "There will never be another series of the show, I think Ruth and I are definite about that.", while Jones said, [...] "Where would <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> it?...No, it's really time {{to say goodbye to}} these characters now". Jones ruled out a film version, declaring the show [...] "very much belongs to the little screen, not the big one".|$|E
2500|$|Justice Breyer {{on whether}} to deny {{jurisdiction}} to citizens outside the U.S. [...] "So what I'm thinking now, assuming that it's very hard to interpret Eisentrager, is that if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>with</b> you, it has a virtue of clarity. There is a clear rule. Not a citizen outside the United States; you don't get your foot in the door. But against you is that same fact. It seems rather contrary to an idea of a constitution with three branches that the executive {{would be free to}} do whatever they want, whatever they want without a check." ...|$|E
