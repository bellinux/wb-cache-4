5|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} of the UK, McDonnell Douglas extensively redesigned the earlier AV-8A Harrier to create the AV-8B. While retaining the general layout of its predecessor, the aircraft incorporates a new wing, an elevated cockpit, a redesigned fuselage, one extra hardpoint per wing, and other structural and aerodynamic refinements. The aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of the Pegasus, which gives the aircraft its V/STOL ability. The AV-8B made its maiden flight in November 1981 and entered service with the USMC in January 1985. Later upgrades added a night-attack capability and radar, resulting in the AV-8B(NA) and AV-8B Harrier II Plus, respectively. An enlarged version named Harrier III was also studied, but not pursued. The UK, through British Aerospace, re-joined the improved Harrier project as a partner in 1981, giving it a significant <b>work-share</b> in the project. After corporate mergers in the 1990s, Boeing and BAE Systems have jointly supported the program. Approximately 340 aircraft were produced in a 22-year production program that ended in 2003.|$|R
40|$|The late 2000 s-recession caused massive {{damage to}} the global economy. High unemployment, low {{consumer}} confidence, declining asset prices and national debt crises were but a few hardships that countries worldwide had to sustain. In terms of unemployment Japan, Germany, and the United States - three of the world’s biggest economies – were affected very differently. A look at unemployment levels reveal striking differences. In Germany, unemployment had {{for much of the}} 2000 s endured levels far above eight percent, and at times close to twelve percent. When crisis hit in late 2007, however, unemployment remained remarkably low and remarkably stable, even dropping to seven percent at one point. Unemployment in the United States, on the other hand, had experienced a steady decline following the early 2000 s-recession from six to four percent. When the crisis hit, the American labor market saw a precipitous rise in unemployment, which peaked at above twelve percent in late 2009. Japan, like the U. S., experienced a steady decline in unemployment leading up to the crisis. But unlike the U. S., Japan was able to keep its unemployment level below six percent when the crisis hit, despite a one percent rise. My paper discusses the reasons for these different unemployment responses in the respective countries. Despite the economic grandeur these countries share, their labor markets are quite distinct from one another. Because of their different characteristics, economic downturns have different effects on unemployment. My investigation suggests that the observed responses can largely, although not exclusively, be explained by existing labor market characteristics. In short, the reason why the United States suffered a sharp rise in unemployment is that labor adjustment was about the only tool that American employers had (and have) at their disposal to deal with the crisis. Japanese and German employers, as my discussion suggests, were able to exploit other channels. Japanese and German labor markets could to a greater degree handle declining demand through transfers and wage and hour adjustments before resorting to layoffs. Furthermore, the governments of Japan and Germany engaged in massive <b>work-share</b> programs in order to prevent mass-layoffs. The American <b>work-share</b> effort, in contrast, was rather limited and ill-suited. In sum, Japan and Germany had more outlets available to relieve the labor market pressure caused by the crisis...|$|R
40|$|The motivational model aims {{to define}} optimal <b>work-share</b> for the {{maintenance}} of a statistical register by utilising the self-interest of all parties involved. This approach thereby replaces the commonly found roles of „producers ” and “consumers ” of register information by an approach of co-operation for efficiently running a statistical business register. Pointing on the co-operation between former „consumers “ and „producers “ of register information is an approach to build up and maintain a statistical register most suitable.

40|$|The primary aim of {{this survey}} is to: * explore whether there is {{potential}} for job-sharing in the South African labour market; * * describe the characteristics of potential job-sharers and to explain why Job-sharing would be an appropriate and feasible solution to unemployment, massive retrenchments, poor quality ofwork life (QWL) and low worker productivity Job-sharing {{has been used in}} many developed countries to address a variety of problems at the individual, organisational and national level. These include allowing workers to have a balance between their work and non-work life; to increase worker productivity and QWL and to increase employment opportunities. The literature survey affirms that these problems are prevalent in Africa as a whole and in South Africa specifically. The survey results reveal that the environment in South is Africa is conducive to jobsharing and that slightly over one third of the workers and organisations and two thirds of the jobseekers are willing to job-share. The results of this study also reveals that QWL, productivity and unemployment does influence the willingness to job-share and that approximately 80 % of the employees would rather either job-share, <b>work-share</b> or opt for some other alternative than to have retrenchments. Thus by implication, job-sharing would address the problems relating to poor QWL, low worker productivity, fewer employment opportunities, as well as massive retrenchments in South Africa. The study has also explored possible reasons and obstacles to job-sharing and found that whether these are perceived as significantly important or not, depends on whether one is an employer, employee or job-seeker. The job-seekers feel more than others, that there is no reason insurmountable or obstacle preventing the introduction of job-sharing by which to avert their unemployed status. There are also differences in willingness to job-share among subgroups with regard to the industry, area of work, position held in the organisation and the availability of job-sharing positions in the organisation. This thesis reports that there is potential for job-sharing in the South African labour market, to address a variety of problems pertaining to workers, organisations, job-seekers and, therefore, the whole nation at large.

40|$|Shanghai’s urban {{development}} {{has come to}} represent China’s rapid economic growth and global integration following the country’s accelerated transition to market economy since the 1990 s. Shanghai’s growing skylines, roaring highways and then its glitzy malls, manicured golf courses and new themed satellite towns, are touted by the media as physical manifestations of the pace and quantity of the city’s {{urban development}}s. But {{it is in the}} centrally-located historic neighborhoods at the western end of the French concessions, where little study has been done, that socio-demographic, cultural, and economic changes influencing processes of urban transformation at the everyday scale is producing the new international trend quarter with a vibe and look echoing the likes of Berlin’s Prenzlauerberg or New York’s Williamsburg. Creative global citizens flock to live and work in the area because of the horizontal and vertical networks that connect their design startups and <b>work-share</b> studios to global and local creative networks. As is in most post-socialist cities, the return of capital and consumer demand generated commercial and spatial opportunity. Unique to Shanghai as a former global city is the extremely rapid usurping of international trends in the grasping of these opportunities. The constellation of returning diaspora compelled by both nostalgia and pragmatism, expats attracted by the city’s historic global connections, and expediently learning and commercial-minded local stakeholders not only facilitate the re-plugging of Shanghai into the global market but are becoming the active residents and users of the city center area that has been for decades shirked by the local residents reminded of compulsory socialization, privacy deprivation and building dilapidation pre-reform. Within the span of two decades, globalized entrepreneurial innovation articulated through spatial transformations. The influx of investment as well as knowhow have created dynamic spatial production systems that are currently showcasing reuse and reprogramming of existing structures in more variety and scales than developed models in the west. Shanghai-based design ateliers are more likely to horizontally network with like-minded comrades in other global cities while within the local value chain sourcing the most efficient production for designs. New platforms for knowledge production where design enterprises converge and exchange are social, temporal and spatial: design clusters working with fluid and flexible timeframes take place in the accessible and open forms. Through detailed case studies of the urban transformations at the architectural, neighborhood, city scales, and how they recalibrate the drivers, agents, urban networks and reuse physical structures, key questions will be raised as to what are the specific urban resources that form and mark the areas of study as generator of cultural and creative capital?

40|$|The {{dissertation}} addresses men and change, intergenerational transmission, historical {{change and}} agency, employing {{as a case}} a longitudinal follow-up study over two generations of men, where the fathers participated in an experimental research project, the <b>Work-Sharing</b> Couples Project, which aimed to promote egalitarian work–family adaptations in Norway in the early 1970 s. The original project was based on both spouses working part-time and shift parenting. The summary presents a multidimensional analysis of the work–family adaptations of the two generations of men: the untraditional adaptation of fathers in the 1970 s; and the neo-traditional adaptations of sons in the 2000 s. Their different work–family adaptations are discussed as situated agency, taking into account different aspects of time and space, personal biography, discursive and material structures of opportunity, and intergenerational dynamics at the family level {{as well as at}} social level. The five articles present the empirical material: Bjørnholt (2009 a) presents the impact on the couple relation and the family of the the parents’ <b>work–sharing</b> arrangement, concluding that the <b>work-sharing</b> arrangement was perceived by the participants to have been beneficial for their couple relationship {{as well as for the}} family as a whole. Bjørnholt (2011) explores the motivations of the <b>work-sharing</b> men to act as agents of change towards gender equality, concluding that personal biography, an authoritative way of being and new masculinity ideals, notably a partner- oriented masculinity, were important.
