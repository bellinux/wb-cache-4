5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar {{became the first}} {{generation}} of wide-body passenger airliners to enter service. In 1978, Boeing unveiled three new models: the twin-engine Boeing 757 to replace its 727, the twin-engine 767 to challenge the Airbus A300, and a trijet 777 concept to compete with the DC-10 and L-1011. The mid-size 757 and 767 launched to market success, due in part to 1980s' extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (ETOPS) regulations governing transoceanic twinjet operations. These regulations allowed twin-engine airliners to make ocean crossings at up to three hours' distance from emergency diversionary airports. Under ETOPS rules, airlines began operating the 767 on long-distance overseas routes that did not require the capacity of larger airliners. The trijet 777 was later dropped, following marketing studies that favored the 757 and 767 variants. Boeing was left <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> and range gap in its product line between the 767-300ER and the 747-400.|$|E

25|$|Incident Response Vehicles (IRV) or 'Pandas' are {{generally}} used when a '999' call has been received regarding an ongoing incident or emergency. Usually an IRV would {{be assigned to}} the call, as their continual patrol of an area reduces their deployment time.

25|$|The Tarnovo school {{continued}} and enriched the traditions and icon {{design of the}} First Bulgarian Empire. Some notable icons include St Eleusa (13th century) from Nessebar which is currently kept in the Alexander Nevski Cathedral in Sofia and St John of Rila (14th century) kept in the Rila Monastery. Like the Boyana Church frescoes in the second one there is realism and non-canonical design. Another feature of the school's iconography were the large icons which were made to fascinate the viewer. An example of such icon is the Poganovo icon in the cathedral of Sofia depicting St Mary with John the Baptist which was produced in 1395. It is double-sided and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> of 93x61 cm.|$|E

A decrease implies hypoventilation, as can occur with restrictive lung disease, pleural effusions or atelectasis.

25|$|COROT-7b {{was found}} by observing its parent star's {{periodic}} decrease in apparent magnitude caused by the planet's transit {{in front of the}} star as seen from Earth. Measuring this dip in brightness, together <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> estimate for the star, allows one to calculate the planet's size. (See Transit method.) The space mission COROT observed the star COROT-7, in the stellar field LRa01, from 15 October 2007 to 3 March 2008. During this period, 153 periodic transit signals of 1.3 h duration with a depth of 3.4 × 10−4 were registered. After 40 days of data acquisition, the Alarm mode pipeline algorithm detected the shallow signal of COROT-7b, starting the follow-up observations from the ground to get a confirmation of the planetary nature of the transiting object.|$|E
25|$|P. alternata builds dense {{clusters}} of nests in dark, damp cavities including caves and man-made {{structures such as}} vaults under bridges, water pipes, and the ceilings of grottoes. The nests of P. alternata typically appear brown with grey and pale bands due {{to the use of}} mud and vegetables. The composite materials of the nests include a mixture of mud, sand, and plant hairs. The nests are cylindrical in shape <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> ranging from 1.5cm in diameter and 6.5cm in length. Similar to other species in the Stenogastrinae subfamily, the nests contain a low number of cells with a maximum of 35 total. There are two known types of nests based on location. The most common type is built on flat surfaces and the other type hangs from thread-like suspensions from ceilings.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the size}} of the {{dispersed}} phase may be difficult to measure, and because colloids have the appearance of solutions, colloids are sometimes identified and characterized by their physico-chemical and transport properties. For example, if a colloid consists of a solid phase dispersed in a liquid, the solid particles will not diffuse through a membrane, whereas with a true solution the dissolved ions or molecules will diffuse through a membrane. Because of the size exclusion, the colloidal particles are unable to pass through the pores of an ultrafiltration membrane <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>size</b> smaller than their own dimension. The smaller {{the size of}} the pore of the ultrafiltration membrane, the lower the concentration of the dispersed colloidal particles remaining in the ultrafiltered liquid. The measured value of the concentration of a truly dissolved species will thus depend on the experimental conditions applied to separate it from the colloidal particles also dispersed in the liquid. This is particularly important for solubility studies of readily hydrolyzed species such as Al, Eu, Am, Cm, or organic matter complexing these species.|$|E
