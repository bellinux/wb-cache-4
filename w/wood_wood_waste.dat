40|$|Gasification of bionmss (<b>wood,</b> <b>wood</b> <b>waste,</b> agrlcultural residues, etc.) is an often-discussed {{option that}} may permit {{utilities}} {{to obtain a}} portion of their fuel requirements from renewable resources. However, the technical state of this option is unclear at present, and this Study was initiated to provide documented performance information of commercial 51 omass gaslfiers to the electric utility industry. Biomass gasification was to be assessed in terms of operability and technical performance by investigating installed commercial gaslfiers. Only one gaslfier installation, the Omnifuel Easifler at Hearst, Ontario met the criteria selected to identify commercial installations able to provide operating data for engineering analysis. AlthouEh the data contained saps and inconsistencies, a reasonably consistent picture of Easlfier operation was derived. The 8 aslfier was observed ~o be responsive to controls, but no long-term operating and maintenance data were available.

40|$|Dutch elm disease (DED) is a {{fungal disease}} that causes high {{mortality}} of elms. DED and its vector beetles are widely present {{in most of}} the countries in the Northern Hemisphere, but they are not known to be present in Finland. DED is a major risk to plant health in Finland. DED and its vectors are moderately likely to enter Finland by natural spread aided by hitchhiking, because they are present in areas close to Finland. Entry via other pathways is much less likely, mainly due to the low volume of trade of untreated wood and plants for planting. DED and its vectors could likely establish in the southern parts of the country, since they currently occur in similar climatic conditions in other countries. DED could cause massive environmental damage as natural elm groves are critically endangered habitats in Finland. The economic consequences to the owners of mature elms could also be significant. Eradication or containment of DED could be possible if strict measures were taken as the patchy distribution of elms would limit the spread of the disease. The most important source of uncertainty in this assessment is the lack of information regarding the amount of elm in fuel <b>wood,</b> <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> and wood chips imported to Finland...|$|E
40|$|This thesis assesses several value chains for {{bioenergy}} {{production in}} Norway and combines these representing two Norwegian scenarios. The environmental impacts are assessed using {{the methodology of}} life cycle assessment (LCA). A complete assessment of climate change impact has been a core task, and biogenic CO 2 emissions are accounted for throughout the value chains investigated. Surface albedo effects {{are included in the}} assessment of forest resources. In addition to global warming potential, the value chains are assessed for three other impact categories; acidification potential, particulate matter formation potential and terrestrial ecotoxicity potential. Life cycle inventories are constructed for a set of six feedstocks, seven treatment options, ten energy conversion options and three energy distribution choices. The different options are then combined to 80 feasible value chains. Transport is included throughout all the value chains. All inventories are assembled to represent Norwegian conditions. Energy flows for the different value chains investigated are found to represent the current bioenergy system, with a potential increase for each value chain towards 2020 - representing the alternative scenario. Results are generated for the individual value chains, the reference scenario and the alternative scenario. The results show large differences between the different value chains. Energy wood and waste wood are the most beneficial feedstocks for bioenergy production, highly dependent on both the GWPbio factors utilised and inclusion of surface albedo effects. Pelletising is the pre-treatment option resulting in the lowest GWP, while integrated torrefaction and pelletising results in the highest GWP. Overall, a CHP plant with electricity demand is the most advantageous conversion route. A stand-alone thermal electricity plant has the definite highest impact, mainly because of low conversion efficiency. Heat distribution shows high impacts compared to electricity and steam distribution, and the resources resulting in lower impacts is therefore recommended as inputs for such units. Generally, handling of biogenic CO 2 emissions is of high importance. The same is the case for surface albedo effects, changing the GWP for forest resources considerably. CHP plants are recommended for electricity production from biomass, and use of TOP, forest residues and stemwood are recommended to take place in the same conversion technology. The environmental impacts from a CHP plant is low, and TOP, forest residues and stemwood show high GWP. The GWP from energy <b>wood,</b> <b>wood</b> <b>waste</b> and pellets are low, and are therefore recommended for use in district heating plants. As stand-alone electricity production is not recommended, the GWP from a district heating plant is limited {{with the use of the}} mentioned resources. Pelletising is recommended for pre-treatment of Norwegian biomass because of low climate change impacts. The Norwegian Government has put forth ambitious goals to reduce the GHG emissions substantially towards 2020 and become climate neutral by 2030. The reference scenario assessed show a GWP of 134 grams CO 2 -equivalents per kWh, while the scenario for 2020 results in a climate change impact of 136 grams CO 2 -equivalents per kWh. Based on this, Norwegian bioenergy can offer a means to reduce the GHG emissions towards 2020, but because of considerable GWP from biogenic CO 2 emissions, bioenergy should not be pursued for a goal of becoming climate neutral by 2030. </p...|$|E
