5|$|A raw 3D {{model of}} Jacob's wolf {{was the basis}} for {{creating}} the others. A muscle system, <b>which</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> appearance of muscles firing and flexing, contributed to this model. From there, the initial fur layout went to painters who were responsible for its color and groom. They also added characteristics, such as wet hair clumping together, and applied it to the fur. They refined this look before passing it off to the lighting and technical directors.|$|E

5|$|In 1874, Gandhi's father Karamchand left Porbandar for {{the smaller}} state of Rajkot, where he became a {{counsellor}} to its ruler, the Thakur Sahib; though Rajkot was a less prestigious state than Porbandar, the British regional political agency was located there, <b>which</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> state's diwan a measure of security. In 1876, Karamchand became diwan of Rajkot and was succeeded as diwan of Porbandar by his brother Tulsidas. His family then rejoined him in Rajkot.|$|E

5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} by a single balanced rudder, <b>which</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> ships excellent maneuverability. The rudder was augmented with special steering system on the engine transmissions; they had gears that could drive half of the engines astern and half forward allowed the screws to assist in turning the ship at sharper angles. The ships tended toward lee helm in general conditions, but in heavy wind, they suffered from weather helm. Both vessels also suffered from severe leeway at low speeds, and the effect was especially pronounced for Nürnberg, owing to her larger superstructure.|$|E
5|$|Thatched House Lodge was the London home of U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower {{during the}} Second World War.

5|$|There {{were few}} {{industrial}} buildings pre-1850; those of note include the 17th-century blast furnace at Pontygwaith <b>which</b> <b>gave</b> <b>the</b> village its {{name and the}} fulling mill established by Harri David in 1738, which in turn gave its name to Tonypandy. Corn mills existed sparsely throughout the valleys as did early coal pits, with two early pits recorded as being opened in 1612 at Rhigos and Cwmparc; though these would have mined from exposed rock in the hillside and not deep mined.|$|E
