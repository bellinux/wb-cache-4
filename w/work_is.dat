5|$|Efforts to {{calculate}} the true economic value of unpaid work, which {{is not included in}} measures such as gross domestic product, have shown that this value is enormous. In the United States, it has been estimated to be between 20–50%, meaning that the true value of unpaid <b>work</b> <b>is</b> trillions of dollars per year. For other countries, the percentage of GDP may be even higher, such as the United Kingdom, where is may be as high as 70%. Because this unpaid <b>work</b> <b>is</b> largely done by women and is unreported in economic indicators, it results in these contributions by women being devalued in a society.|$|E
