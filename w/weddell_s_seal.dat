40|$|The {{pursuit of}} high Mach number flight {{presents}} several {{challenges to the}} airframe and engine design engineers. Most obvious is the resulting high temperatures encountered as the aircraft approaches Mach 3 and above. The encountered high temperatures and shaft speeds of engines require rethinking {{in the areas of}} material selections, component design and component operating life. In the area of sump compartment sealing, {{one of the most difficult}} sealing applications is the sealing of an engine s rear sump. Normally this sump will need some method of sealing between two rotating shafts. This sealing operation is done with an intershaft seal. The aft sump region also presents an additional design requirement for the intershaft seal. This region has to absorb the engine s thermal growth, which means that in the seal area, axial movement, on the order of 0. 30 in., between the rotating shafts must be tolerated. A new concept or new technology of sealing an intershaft sump configuration is being developed. This concept, called a rotating intershaft brush seal has key attributes that will allow this seal to perform better, in the demanding environment of sealing an aft sump with two rotating shafts, when compared to today <b>s</b> <b>sealing</b> technology of labyrinth and carbon se...|$|R

The independent evaluations are summarized in this document. Many of the features jointly agreed upon as desirable for a state-of-the art electronic seal are contained in the latest version of the German developed VACOSS 3 system. This system has drawn on the U. S. and German development and evaluation activities in arriving at its present status. The U. S. development activity was completed in 1980 whereas the VACOSS 3 continued incorporating new ideas in early 1983. The joint testing was thus not only for comparison purposes, but also to generally aid in future electronic seal development. Operational testing of both seals revealed a need for improved procedures. Both seals generally met the specified environmental operating conditions. Vulnerability testing identified the ability to predict the code sequences in the older U. <b>S.</b> <b>seal</b> and revealed physical vulnerabilities of the VACOSS 3 system which are being corrected.

40|$|A novel transaortic {{ventricular}} cannula, {{known as}} the 2 ̆ 7 double barrel 2 ̆ 7 cannula (DBC), is designed to minimize the invasiveness of Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) implantation by combining the inlet and outlet cannulae into a single dual lumen cannula.

This design offers several potential advantages over the current state of-the-art. The benefits of the DBC include less invasive surgery and providing mechanical support to the septum.
