40|$|As {{population}} will reach over 9 billion by 2050, {{interest in the}} forest-food nexus is rising. Forests {{play an important role}} in food production and nutrition. Forests can provide nutritionally-balanced diets, woodfuel for cooking and a broad set of ecosystem services. A large body of evidence recommends multi-functional and integrated landscape approaches to reimagine forestry and agriculture systems. Here, after a commented discussion of the literature produced in the last decade about the role for forests with respect to the food security global emergency, we summarize the state of the art in Italy as a representative country-case-study. The aim is to increase awareness about the potential of silviculture in Italy for combining ecological resilience with economic resilience, and reducing the pressure over tropical and sub-tropical forests by means of a sustainable intensification of forest management at national level. Although a quantification of the Italian <b>non-wood</b> forest <b>products</b> is difficult, the potential of this sector for the Italian bioeconomy is relatively high. Italy is among the four top European exporters of cork stoppers, is one of the three top countries for chestnut seed processing, and is among the leading exporters of wild mushroom, while it is the only European country among the top five global importers of tannins. In order to develop this sector for the food industry, more research is needed on <b>non-wood</b> forest <b>products,</b> the scale of production, emerging markets, marketing and production innovation. On the other hand, chain-supply fragmentation, landowner inertia, and lack of governance and cooperation may hamper an effective exploitation of <b>non-wood</b> <b>products.</b> A renewed joint impulse for exploitation of wood and <b>non-wood</b> <b>products</b> may come from a sustainable intensification of forest management. The strategies to guarantee an effective supply of <b>non-wood</b> <b>products</b> require appropriate business skills and the presence of a structured business services. A transparent market is also essential. Therefore, the introduction of standards (like those by forest certification schemes) is very important. They can add value to products and emphasize the importance and complexity of the forest sector. However, the implementation of sustainable forest management for an effective supply of <b>non-wood</b> <b>products</b> is affected by the availability of appropriate planning tools, and the public officers need a new mindset to stimulate and support business capacity of forest owners...|$|R

The method which was used is by distributing the questionnaires and carried out formal interviews with the respondents.

The questionnaires comprises of three parts which the first, second and third parts are containing the information regarding on the demographic of the respondent, the inventory of the mangrove’s <b>non-wood</b> forest <b>products</b> which sells by the respondent and the contribution of the mangrove’s <b>non-wood</b> forest <b>product</b> to the development respondent’s socioeconomy respectively. The respondents as a whole are more than 53 people and only 13 people only involved in the recruitment of mangroves. Of the total, found only three respondents who actually depend on the mangrove’s <b>non-wood</b> forest <b>products,</b> while 10 others were only made to take the job as a sideline of mangrove forests. The types of mangrove’s <b>non-wood</b> forest <b>products</b> stated are mangrove crab (Scylla sarrata), shell (Cerithidea obtuse), cat fish (Plotosus sp.), mullet fish (Valamugil seheli) and marine shell (Polymesuda expansa).
