5|$|During dinner, {{the family}} is euphoric with their new powers. However, it leads to an {{argument}} about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> doing with them. Aliens Kang and Kodos {{see this as an}} opportunity to strike Earth, and an alien invasion unfolds. Realizing none of their powers are strong enough to defeat the aliens, Bart and Lisa visit Professor Frink. They visit his house to find him not there, but they stumble upon a portal that sends them to a place called the Game Engine where all video games are made. After saving him from a giant gorilla, Frink gives them The Simpsons Games player's guide to teach them how to better use their powers as well as gain new ones, and the Simpson family soon sets out to try and stop the alien invasion. First, Bart and Lisa aid Captain McCallister in beating back mind-controlled dolphins that are attacking the city aquarium. Then, Bart and Homer defeat the Lard Lad statue which has come to life. Finally, they rescue Cletus from the aliens.|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} amount of public revenue created by the pipeline provoked debates {{about what to do}} with the windfall. The record $900 million created by the Prudhoe Bay oil lease sale took place at a time when the entire state budget was less than $118 million, yet the entire amount created by the sale was used up by 1975. Taxes on the pipeline and oil carried by it promised to bring even more money into state coffers. To ensure that oil revenue wasn't spent as it came in, the Alaska Legislature and governor Jay Hammond proposed the creation of an Alaska Permanent Fund—a long-term savings account for the state. This measure required a constitutional amendment, which was duly passed in November 1976. The amendment requires at least 25 percent of mineral extraction revenue to be deposited in the Permanent Fund. On February 28, 1977, the first deposit—$734,000—was put into the Permanent Fund. That deposit and subsequent ones were invested entirely in bonds, but debates quickly arose about the style of investments and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> used for.|$|E

It {{is not only the}} average person who needs to be educated in the dimensions of their own genomic sequence but also professionals, including physicians and science journalists, who must be provided with the knowledge required to inform and educate their patients and the public.

2500|$|The [...] "masking" [...] of an alienated life, and the {{attempts}} to counteract it, are thought of in these Marxist theories as co-existing but contradictory processes, involving constant conflicts between what people really are, how they present themselves, and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> according to some external requirement imposed on them – a conflict which involves a perpetual struggle from which people can rarely totally withdraw, because they still depend for their existence on others, and have to face them, masked or unmasked.|$|E
2500|$|The {{planning}} {{team who}} created the CRUs {{gave a great deal}} of thought to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> called. Based on the Crookham and No. 21 WOSB investigations, Army psychiatrists emphasised that POWs were very sensitive to accusations or implications that they were mentally [...] "damaged." [...] Based on this the Adjutant General Sir Ronald Adam issued official instructions that:The word [...] "rehabilitation is frequently taken to connote a process of mental or physical reconditioning made necessary as the prisoner of war is looked on as abnormal or even a [...] "mental case" [...] the expression [...] "mental rehabilitation" [...] or these words separately shall not be used in conversation or in writing.One of the participants at the SRTU had also strongly recommended that the planners change the name of the Unit. He stated that 'I would not call it a Special Training Unit to any man... I think the word [...] "training" [...] should be changed.' In the end, the planners decided that 'the expressions [...] "resettlement" [...] or [...] "resettlement training" [...] will be employed instead.' ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{even though}} {{mathematics}}, or studies in logic {{were part of}} the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. [...] "The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths" [...] – key word being [...] "divine". İnalcık also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to confirm the doctrines of Islam." [...] Hence, madaris – schools were basically religious centres for religious teachings and learning in the Ottoman world. Although scholars such as Goffman have argued that the Ottomans were highly tolerant and lived in a pluralistic society, it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact heftily religious and were not religiously pluralistic, but centred around Islam. Similarly, in Europe [...] "Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the Torah." [...] Wiesner-Hanks also says that Protestants also wanted to teach [...] "proper religious values." [...] This shows that in the early modern period, Ottomans and Europeans were similar in their ideas about how schools should be managed and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> primarily focused on. Thus, Ottoman madaris were very similar to present day schools {{in the sense that they}} offered a wide range of studies; however, these studies, in their ultimate objective, aimed to further solidify and consolidate Islamic practices and theories.|$|E
