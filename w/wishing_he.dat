Midway through the series, she and Adam start a brief love affair, which ends in the {{penultimate}} episode. In the fifth series, particularly in its later episodes, Adam suffers from several mental breakdowns following the loss of Fiona. He has recurring nightmares that involve his being wounded and unable to return home to his son, and in the eighth episode, he has a panic attack after learning that Wes has briefly run away from home; this attack jeopardises his life during an operation. In the series finale, Adam is revealed to be suicidally depressed, <b>wishing</b> <b>he</b> had died in Fiona's place. But after another panic attack, {{he is able to}} pull through, save fellow officer Ros Myers (Hermione Norris), and escape from the Thames Barrier before they both drown.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the more}} {{successful}} films was Melody Time, the animated 1948 film from Walt Disney Studios featuring Dennis Day. The Legend of Johnny Appleseed, a 19-minute segment, {{tells the story of}} an apple farmer who sees others going west, wistfully <b>wishing</b> <b>he</b> was not tied down by his orchard, until an angel appears, singing an apple song, setting Johnny on a mission. When he treats a skunk kindly, all animals everywhere thereafter trust him. The cartoon featured lively tunes, and a childlike simplicity of message. This animated short was included in Disney's American Legends, a compilation of four animated shorts.|$|E

60|$|As he {{was passing}} Milton's study, a white figure glided out of it. All {{that he had}} ever read or heard of spectres rushed into Shoeblossom's petrified brain. <b>He</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> was safely in bed. <b>He</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had never come out of it. <b>He</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had led a better and nobler life. <b>He</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had never been born.|$|R
6000|$|What {{could he}} do to revivify his clergy? <b>He</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had more {{personal}} magnetism, <b>he</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had a darker and a larger presence. <b>He</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had not been saddled with Whippham's rather futile son as his chaplain. <b>He</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had a dean instead of being his own dean. With an unsympathetic rector. <b>He</b> <b>wished</b> <b>he</b> had it in him to make some resounding appeal. He might of course preach a series of thumping addresses and sermons, rather on the lines of [...] "Fors Clavigera," [...] to masters and men, in the Cathedral. Only it was so difficult to get either masters or men into the Cathedral.|$|R
500|$|Although he {{expressed}} bitterness upon leaving office, <b>wishing</b> <b>he</b> had {{never left the}} farm in Highland County, he soon resumed his involvement in politics, speaking for the unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor, Harding, in 1910. [...] The gubernatorial candidate had previously supported Foraker, though he had backed Taft in 1908. In 1912, Foraker made speeches in support of Taft's re-election bid, although {{he felt he had}} been badly treated by Taft in 1908. [...] Foraker refused, however, to attack the third-party candidate, former president Roosevelt, whose candidacy split the party and led to the election of Democrat Woodrow Wilson.|$|E
500|$|Over time, Anarky {{emerged as}} each man's {{favorite}} character, with Grant <b>wishing</b> <b>he</b> could emulate the character, and remarking that [...] "Anarky in Gotham City" [...] {{was the most}} personal story he had ever written, and the foremost among his three favorite stories he had ever written for the Batman mythos. Of Breyfogle, Grant complimented that the former [...] "draws Anarky as if he loves the character." [...] While Breyfogle acknowledged that Anarky was his favorite of the creations they collaborated on, he felt that his own appreciation was not as great as Grant's, commenting that Anarky was [...] "Alan's baby".|$|E
500|$|His contemporaries noted his {{classical}} style. The journalist A.R.B. Palmer {{described his}} cover drive as [...] "... perfectly balanced and true ... the bat seems a whip in his hands." [...] Clem Hill, the former Australian captain, noted Jackson's sparkling footwork, watching {{close enough to}} notice that his toes turned in as he walked. [...] Like Kippax, whose style was uncannily similar, Jackson wore his shirt-sleeves almost down to his wrists. This was not in imitation but to conceal the blemishes on his arms caused by psoriasis. Kippax was not seen by some as the best person to imitate, with Charles Kelleway critical of Jackson's flourishes, <b>wishing</b> <b>he</b> would not be so, [...] "... cramped in copying other batsman's styles".|$|E

500|$|Hendrix {{described}} [...] "Manic Depression" [...] as [...] "ugly times music"; {{during a}} live performance {{he explained the}} meaning of the lyrics: [...] "It's a story about a cat <b>wishing</b> <b>he</b> could make love to music instead of the same old everyday woman." [...] The song is unusual in that its written in triple meter, or 3/4 time, which is the time signature commonly associated with a waltz, whereas most rock music is written in 4/4. Although his delivery is rock oriented, Mitchell's drumming on the track is reminiscent of Elvin Jones's fluid jazz patterns. Musicologist Andy Aledort noted Hendrix's [...] "dramatic use of chromaticism" [...] during the song's opening bars and the [...] "heavily vibratoed unison bends" [...] that presage what he described as one of Hendrix's best guitar solos.|$|E
500|$|Clinton Heylin {{and writer}} Christopher Ricks {{discussed}} Dylan's restlessness in the song. Heylin {{said that in}} [...] "Ballad of Easy Rider", co-written by Dylan and Roger McGuinn two years earlier, Dylan claimed he was content to watch while [...] "The river flows, flows to the sea/Wherever it flows, that's where I want to be"; by contrast, in [...] "Watching the River Flow", Dylan writes {{that he wants to}} be moving, <b>wishing</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "back in the city/Instead of this old bank of sand". Ricks found Dylan's unsettledness at odds with the implied bucolic notion of watching the river flow. For Ricks, the vocal phrasing and the musical arrangements clash with the lyrics; the [...] "choppy" [...] rhythms and [...] "stroppy stomping" [...] of the backing track, disrupt the theme of contentedly watching the river. He noted that two of the verses begin with [...] "People disagreeing", introducing conflict into the song, and concluded that [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] is [...] "tarred with a realism that qualifies and complicates the lure of the lazy".|$|E
500|$|Bryan Byun, of DVD Verdict, {{believes}} that Welling {{was the perfect}} choice for Clark Kent: [...] "I can't imagine a more ideal actor to play this superpowered farm boy than Tom Welling, with his wholesome, honest face and heroic good looks—Welling not only resembles Christopher Reeve physically, but has all of the earnest charm that made Reeve the quintessential Superman." [...] The Free Lance–Stars Ron Hedelt likened Welling's performances as Clark Kent to that of Christopher Reeve's performances in the Superman films, stating that Welling manages to portray a [...] "... sweet, unassuming teenager ..." [...] while showing Clark struggle with the truth about himself. Comics2Film's Rob Worley also wrote of the physical resemblance Welling has to Christopher Reeve, noting that the actor gave the character depth with his convincing portrayal of Clark's longing to fit in. When comparing Smallville's Clark Kent to Bryan Singer's Superman (Brandon Routh) in Superman Returns, Seattle Times Julia Waterhous found Smallville's Clark Kent to be the more intriguing character. Waterhous explained that {{this was due to}} the inner turmoil of Clark— not being able to tell those he loved his secret— and the fact that no matter what his faults were he continued to put others before himself, remaining [...] "... pure and good ...". She explained that this allowed the audience to become intimate with the character, something lacking in the film version. According to the Associated Press, Welling's popularity as Clark Kent on Smallville had fans of the show <b>wishing</b> <b>he</b> would take the role Routh received in Superman Returns.|$|E

5000|$|The poem {{describes}} a child's {{longing for the}} freedom he sees {{in the lives of}} those around him. When the gong sounds ten in the morning, he walks to his school and sees the hawker crying [...] "Bangles, crystal bangles!" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>he</b> could be a hawker.

500|$|Kala was {{met with}} {{widespread}} critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 87, based on 37 reviews. In the Los Angeles Times, Ann Powers wrote that Kala succeeded at embodying disenfranchised characters in the dissonant Third World with [...] "truly multi-vocal" [...] music whose [...] "every sound signified something different, driving the music's meaning into some new corner". Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club said the music ventured far enough where it served as both a party album and a progressive aural assault, while AllMusic's Andy Kellman felt that Kala was better for intensifying Arulars qualities and [...] "mixing cultures with respectful irreverence". Barry Walters of Spin credited M.I.A. with evoking both the social demands and percussive sounds of the Third World, while finding the album relevant {{at a time when}} [...] "more Americans than ever feel like outsiders in their own country". Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau said the lyrics were [...] "cannier politically" [...] than Arular, and the music was more decisive in embodying the imagination and recreation of [...] "an unbowed international underclass that proves how smart it is just by stating its business, which includes taking your money". He later said that he had [...] "pressed" [...] the editors of Rolling Stone to let him give Kala four-and-a-half stars in his review for the magazine, <b>wishing</b> <b>he</b> [...] "had the foresight to fight for five" [...] because the album [...] "kept growing on me till I even dug the Timbaland remnant [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|Much of Audelay's work as {{contained}} in MS.
