25|$|Along the African coast {{you will}} hear that dirge-like strain in all their songs, as at work or {{paddling}} their canoes to and from shore, they keep time to the music. On the southern plantations {{you will hear}} it also, and in the negro melodies every where, plaintive and melodious, sad and earnest. It seems like the dirge of national degradation, the <b>wail</b> <b>of</b> a race, stricken and crushed, familiar with tyranny, submission and unrequited labor… And here I cannot help noticing the similarity existing between the working chorus of the sailors and the dirge-like negro melody, to which my attention was specially directed by an incident I witnessed or rather heard.|$|E
25|$|The {{vocabulary}} of the African wolf {{is similar to}} that of the domestic dog, with seven sounds having been recorded. The African wolf's vocalisations include howls, barks, growls, whines and cackles. Subspecies can be recognised by differences in their howls. One of the most commonly heard sounds is a high, keening <b>wail,</b> <b>of</b> which there are three varieties; a long single toned continuous howl, a wail that rises and falls, and a series of short, staccato howls. These howls are used to repel intruders and attract family members. Howling in chorus is thought to reinforce family bonds, as well as establish territorial status. A comparative analysis of African wolf and some grey wolf subspecies' howls demonstrated that the former's howls bear similarities to those of the Indian grey wolf, being high pitched and of relatively short duration.|$|E
25|$|Many railfans have a {{fixation}} with steam locomotives, which sometimes also fascinate the general public, {{as seen by}} the attendance at stations to view steam-hauled railtours. Sometimes the appeal of trains is nostalgic, recalling an earlier era when the railroads {{played a central role}} in commerce and transportation, and the depot was the center of every town. Nostalgia may also result from the long, lonesome <b>wail</b> <b>of</b> the train's horn, which mimics vocalizations that want for a more simple time reminiscent of home, as heard in country or folk music worldwide. Sometimes the appeal is due to a fondness for large machinery that can be inspected and photographed up close. Sometimes there is an appeal of the scenery of the railroad running through open, uninviting terrain, or the gritty ambiance of the urban train yard. In this case, urban exploration poses a similar appeal. Some people were raised near streetcar tracks or railways. Everyday activities were associated with railroad, which seemed to be a part of life. This may lead to an interest in railcars, how they move, numbering, and other rail systems in the world and how they compare with their native ones. If these people move to another locale, their interest in railroads might be nostalgic.|$|E

500|$|The {{music of}} Il ritorno shows the unmistakable {{influence}} of the composer's earlier works. Penelope's lament, which opens Act I, is reminiscent both of Orfeo's Redentemi il mio ben and the lament from L'Arianna. The martial-sounding music which accompanies references to battles and {{the killing of the}} suitors, derives from Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda, while for the song episodes in Il ritorno Monteverdi draws in part on the techniques which he developed in his 1632 vocal work Scherzi musicale. In typical Monteverdi fashion the opera's characters are vividly portrayed in their music. Penelope and Ulisse, with what is described by Ringer as [...] "honest musical and verbal declamation", overcome the suitors whose styles are [...] "exaggerated and ornamental". Iro, perhaps [...] "the first great comic character in opera", opens his Act 3 monologue with a <b>wail</b> <b>of</b> distress that stretches across eight bars of music. Penelope begins her lament with a reiteration of E flats that, according to Ringer, [...] "suggest a sense of motionless and emotional stasis" [...] that well represents her condition as the opera begins. At the work's end, her travails over, she unites with Ulisse in a duet of life-affirming confidence which, Ringer suggests, no other composer bar Verdi could have achieved.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Wagner made {{increasing}} use of dissonance {{for dramatic}} effect as his style developed, particularly in his later operas. [...] In the scene known as [...] "Hagen’s Watch" [...] from the first act of Götterdämmerung, according to [...] the music conveys a sense of [...] "matchless brooding evil", and the excruciating dissonance in bars 9–10 below it constitute [...] "a semitonal <b>wail</b> <b>of</b> desolation".|$|E
2500|$|The naval cannon fire {{began at}} daybreak, halting {{periodically}} {{to allow the}} Russians to extend offers of peace to the Kiks.ádi, which were in turn rejected. [...] That afternoon, the Tlingits' response {{was that they had}} tired of battle, and would accede to the Russian demands to evacuate Shís'gi Noow the following day. Once the sun had set, the natives held their last gathering in the sapling fort. The elders offered praise for their clansmen who had defended the Kiks.ádi homeland against a formidable enemy. The Clan gathered together for a last song, one that ended with a loud drum roll and a <b>wail</b> <b>of</b> anguish (which the Russians interpreted as a sign of their surrender).|$|E

2500|$|Much of Barrett Browning's work {{carries a}} {{religious}} theme. She had read and studied such works as Milton's Paradise Lost and Dante's Inferno. She says in her writing, [...] "We want {{the sense of}} the saturation of Christ's blood upon the souls of our poets, that it may cry through them in answer to the ceaseless <b>wail</b> <b>of</b> the Sphinx of our humanity, expounding agony into renovation. Something of this has been perceived in art when its glory was at the fullest. Something of a yearning after this may be seen among the Greek Christian poets, something which would have been much with a stronger faculty". She believed that [...] "Christ's religion is essentially poetry — poetry glorified". She explored the religious aspect in many of her poems, especially in her early work, such as the sonnets.|$|E
2500|$|Is {{there any}} incongruity in this Jewish boy {{with his face}} painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not. Indeed, I {{detected}} again and again the minor key of Jewish music, the <b>wail</b> <b>of</b> the Chazan, the cry of anguish of a people who had suffered. The son {{of a line of}} rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world's history." [...] According to Alexander, Eastern European Jews were uniquely qualified to understand the music, noting how Jolson himself made the comparison of Jewish and African-American suffering in a new land in his film Big Boy: In a blackface portrayal of a former slave, he leads a group of recently freed slaves, played by black actors, in verses of the classic slave spiritual [...] "Go Down Moses."

[...] She and Worf {{had been trying to}} conceive, despite the doubts of Dr. Bashir that such a {{pregnancy}} was possible. After Major Kira tells Jadzia she has been praying for a conception, Jadzia receives encouraging test results from Julian, and goes to the station's temple to thank the Prophets. It now appears a pregnancy will be possible. [...] The Cardassian Dukat arrives, possessed by a Pah-wraith, with the intention of destroying the orb-like Bajoran artifacts known as the [...] "Tears of the Prophets". [...] Jadzia is no match for Dukat while he is infused with the Pah-wraith. He mortally wounds her and destroys the orbs. [...] Upon her death in the infirmary, a distraught Worf screams out a Klingon <b>wail</b> <b>of</b> sorrow for his beloved and to let the Klingon afterworld know a warrior was on the way ("Heart of Glory"). Her death shakes the crew to its core: by the beginning of season 7, Sisko has left the station in despair and Worf has been risking his life on increasingly dangerous missions.|$|E

2500|$|The sonnet {{begins with}} the speaker expressing lament to youth with [...] "O that you were yourself!" [...] More simply, the speaker deplores that youth isn't {{absolute}} and permanent, and with [...] "yourself", the speaker is referring to the figure of youth's soul. Following this, the speaker address the youth as [...] "love", further developing the speaker's theme of adoration and personal affection for youth. From there, the speaker tells this youth that [...] "you are / No longer yours, than you yourself here live", saying that the youth's identity is constantly fading away from him as he ages, {{as if he is}} unbecoming himself. With the lines [...] "Against this coming end you should prepare / And your sweet semblance to some other give", the speaker is simply saying that the youth's life is slipping away day after day, and if he doesn't get married and have children, he will lose his identity to his death. Continuing from this idea, the speaker says [...] "So should that beauty which you hold in lease / Find no determination; then you were / Yourself again after yourself's decease, / When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear", all meaning that whatever beauty the youth still has is only temporary (leased to him) and will be lost, unless he has children who continue the legacy and identity of his youthful beauty even after death. Continuing with [...] "Who lets so fair a house fall to decay," [...] the speaker refers to the youth as this [...] "house" [...] in reference to his fair body and his fair lineage. Adding to this, the speaker continues on with [...] "Which husbandry in honour might uphold, / Against the stormy gusts of winter's day / And barren rage of death's eternal cold?". [...] These lines suggest that by taking up marriage and becoming a husband and a father, the youth might be able to maintain his essence of youth against the devastations of time and age. This, the speaker compares to storms and winter, ending with the threat of the eternal nature of death, at which point the youth would be too late in renewing himself. In the ending couplet, the speaker mirrors his starting <b>wail</b> <b>of</b> lament in line 1 with [...] "O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know, / You had a father: let your son say so." [...] Here, the speaker is separating the youth figure he adores from those he considers foolish, or [...] "unthrifts", and connects that to the youth's inheritance, suggesting that only [...] "unthrifts" [...] would ignore their inheritance of life and youth and deny their own fathers' wish for continued lineage and legacy.|$|E
