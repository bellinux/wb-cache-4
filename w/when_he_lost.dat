5|$|In 1966, {{in one of}} {{the closest}} polls in UK history, Sir Harmar Nicholls held the seat by three votes after seven recounts.

The growth in the New Town from 1967 may in part account for Labour's victory here in 1974. In 1979, however, Ward lost the seat to the Conservative Brian Mawhinney, who would represent Peterborough for the entire duration of the incoming Conservative government and was a Cabinet Minister and Conservative Party Chairman during the second Major government (1992–97).|$|E
