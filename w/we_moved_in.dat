Sarvis also supports same-sex marriage {{and says it}} is a personal issue for him because his own marriage, which is biracial, was illegal in Virginia 50 years ago. Sarvis opposed the controversial transportation package, , which increased the sales tax and {{was signed into law}} by Virginia governor Bob McDonnell; Sarvis said the bill was a [...] "mistake" [...] arguing that, [...] "We should have moved closer to a system in which users pay for the transportation infrastructure they use. Instead, <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction." [...] Sarvis also opposes medicaid expansion citing: [...] "Medicaid expansion comes with diminishing federal subsidies over time, meaning expansion now will lead inexorably to future state-level spending increases and tax increases and the crowding out of other spending priorities." [...] In addition, Sarvis wants to end various taxes such as the car tax and occupational license tax and has called for tax reform with a focus on a more uniform and rule of law-based tax system. Sarvis also {{called for an end to}} [...] "the increasing aggressiveness of law enforcement tactics" [...] after Virginia ABC agents mistook a crate of sparkling water for a case of beer which led to a late-night altercation with University of Virginia students; Sarvis proposed shifting law enforcement from the ABC, the state agency tasked with policing liquor sales, to state and local police and for Virginia to end its eighty-year state monopoly on liquor sales.|$|E

60|$|The {{enormous}} broad {{tires of}} the chariots and the padded {{feet of the}} animals brought forth no sound from the moss-covered sea bottom; and so <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> utter silence, like some huge phantasmagoria, except when the stillness was broken by the guttural growling of a goaded zitidar, or the squealing of fighting thoats. The green Martians converse but little, and then usually in monosyllables, low and like the faint rumbling of distant thunder.|$|E
60|$|To {{ride down}} upon them thus, {{in the silence}} and heat of that {{uninhabited}} valley, was to realize in every detail, a phase of the old-time life of the plains. <b>We</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> silence.

Nothing moved save our ponies and those distant monstrous kine whose presence filled us with the same emotion which had burned {{in the hearts of}} our pioneer ancestors.|$|E

60|$|One such storm which leaped upon us at {{the close}} of a warm and {{beautiful}} day in February lasted for two days and three nights, making life on the open prairie impossible even to the strongest man. The thermometer fell to thirty degrees below zero and the snow-laden air moving at a rate of eighty miles an hour pressed upon the walls of our house with giant power. The sky of noon was darkened, so that <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> a pallid half-light, and the windows thick with frost shut us in as if with gray shrouds.|$|E
60|$|She {{opened the}} door and fled down the path to the shore. I {{snatched}} a lantern from the wall, lighted it, and followed. It was the blackest night I was ever out in, dark with the very darkness of death. The rain fell thickly and heavily. I overtook Josie, caught her hand, and stumbled along in her wake, for she went with the speed and recklessness of a distraught woman. <b>We</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> the little flitting circle of light shed by the lantern. All around us and above us was a horrible, voiceless darkness, held, as it were, at bay by the friendly light.|$|E
6000|$|Arrived at {{a kind of}} [...] "landing" [...] on {{the other}} side, our first care was so to secure the boat under the bank as to favor a hasty re-embarking in case we should be so unfortunate as to incur the natural {{consequence}} of our act; then, following an old road {{through the ranks of}} standing corn, <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> force upon the Confederate position, five strong, with an armament of three Springfield rifles and two Colt's revolvers. We had not the further advantage of music and banners. One thing favored the expedition, giving it an apparent assurance of success: it was well officered--an officer to each man and a half.|$|E

60|$|We were {{coated with}} it like millers; {{so were the}} coach, the mules, the mail-bags, the driver--we and the sage-brush and the other scenery were all one {{monotonous}} color. Long trains of freight wagons in the distance envelope in ascending masses of dust suggested pictures of prairies on fire. These teams and their masters were the only life we saw. Otherwise <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> the midst of solitude, silence and desolation. Every twenty steps we passed the skeleton of some dead beast of burthen, with its dust-coated skin stretched tightly over its empty ribs. Frequently a solemn raven sat upon the skull or the hips and contemplated the passing coach with meditative serenity.|$|E
60|$|We kept to our {{westerly}} {{course for}} several hours when the lookout's cry announced a sail. I ordered the U-33's course altered, and we bore down upon the stranger, for I {{had come to a}} decision which was the result of necessity. We could not lie {{there in the middle of}} the Atlantic and starve to death if there was any way out of it. The sailing ship saw us while we were still a long way off, as was evidenced by her efforts to escape. There was scarcely any wind, however, and her case was hopeless; so when we drew near and signaled her to stop, she came into the wind and lay there with her sails flapping idly. <b>We</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> quite close to her. She was the Balmen of Halmstad, Sweden, with a general cargo from Brazil for Spain.|$|E

Guert now declared there was no use in hesitating any longer; if asleep he would approach the chestnut cautiously, and capture the stranger, if an Indian, before he could rise; and if a white man, it must be some one belonging to our own set, who was taking a nap, probably, after a fatiguing march. Susquesus must have satisfied himself, by this time, {{that there was no}} immediate danger; for merely saying, [...] "all go together," [...] he quitted the cover, and led down towards the chestnut with a rapid but noiseless step. As <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> a body all five of us reached the tree at the same instant, where we found Sam, one of our own hunters, and whom we supposed to be with Mr. Traverse, stretched on his back, dead; with a wound in his breast that had been inflicted by a knife.

6000|$|For myself I {{declined}} at once, and I am {{glad that}} Polly did the same. I told her <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> a sphere as {{far removed from}} the one in which she did, as the sun was from the earth, and that I was sure it was a great mistake, as my own example might prove, to go out of it. [...] "It is pleasant for a time, Ada," [...] I said, [...] "but it is a bitter fruit; no good can come of it. When Percy comes home, if we are married, and if Polly is still single, it will be a different thing; but at present Daisy Villa has nothing in common, except our affection, with Wilton Crescent and Belgrave Square. We shall be very glad to come over sometimes to see you quietly, and for you to drive over to see us when you can spare time from your gaieties, but beyond that, as long as I am Miss Ashleigh, nothing." [...] Ada tried hard to shake my resolution, but in vain, and Polly was equally firm with myself.|$|E
60|$|We had {{a fellow}} on board, an Irish-American, {{for all the}} world like a beggar in a print by Callot; one-eyed, with great, splay crow's-feet round the sockets; a knotty squab nose coming down over his moustache; a miraculous hat; a shirt that had been white, ay, ages long ago; an alpaca coat in its last sleeves; and, without hyperbole, no buttons to his trousers. Even in these rags and tatters, the man twinkled all over with impudence like a piece of sham jewellery; and I have heard him offer a {{situation}} to one of his fellow-passengers with the air of a lord. Nothing could overlie such a fellow; a kind of base success was written on his brow. He was then in his ill days; but I can imagine him in Congress with his mouth full of bombast and sawder. As <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> the same circle, I was brought necessarily into his society. I do not think I ever heard him say anything that was true, kind, or interesting; but there was entertainment in the man's demeanour. You might call him a half-educated Irish Tigg.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{the reading}} of this letter I made sure my {{colleague}} was insane; but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound to do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less I {{was in a position}} to judge of its importance; and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose accordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to Jekyll's house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by the same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent at once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we were yet speaking; and <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> a body to old Dr. Denman's surgical theatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll's private cabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the lock excellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and have to do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was near despair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hours' work the door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took out the drawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and returned with it to Cavendish Square.|$|E
60|$|Yes, I'll come now, she said. Very reverently she kneeled down, {{and kissed}} the dead hare; then rose and gave me her hand, and <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> on <b>in</b> silence.|$|R

6000|$|The slow-fading {{twilight}} {{was still}} in the great drawing-room when we came down. The housekeeper had told us this apartment was rarely used, there being others, smaller and more convenient, for the same needs. It seemed now, however, to be occupied in my comrade's honour. At the furthest end, rising to the roof like a royal tomb in a cathedral, was a great chimney-piece of chiselled white marble, yellowed by time, in which a light fire was crackling. Before the fire stood a small short man, with his hands behind him; near him was Miss Searle, so transformed by her dress that at first I scarcely knew her. There was in our entrance and reception something remarkably chilling and solemn. <b>We</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> silence up the long room; Mr. Searle advanced slowly, a dozen steps, to meet us; his sister stood motionless. I was conscious of her masking her visage with a large white tinselled fan, and that her eyes, grave and enlarged, watched us intently over the top of it. The master of Lackley grasped in silence the proffered hand of his kinsman and eyed him from head to foot, suppressing, I noted, a start of surprise at his resemblance to Sir Joshua's portrait. [...] "This is a happy day." [...] And then turning to me with an odd little sharp stare: [...] "My cousin's friend is my friend." [...] Miss Searle lowered her fan.|$|E
6000|$|They saluted, and {{we moved}} forward. I breathed freer. A dozen times I had {{imagined}} I heard the hoofbeats of the real Captain Raymond's troop arriving behind us, and had been sitting on pins and needles all the while that that conversation was dragging along. I breathed freer, but was still not comfortable, for Joan had given only the simple command, [...] "Forward!" [...] Consequently <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> a walk. Moved in a dead walk past a dim and lengthening column of enemies at our side. The suspense was exhausting, yet it lasted but a short while, for when the enemy's bugles sang the [...] "Dismount!" [...] Joan gave the word to trot, {{and that was a}} great relief to me. She was always at herself, you see. Before the command to dismount had been given, somebody might have wanted the countersign somewhere along that line if we came flying by at speed, but now we seemed to be on our way to our allotted camping position, so we were allowed to pass unchallenged. The further we went the more formidable was the strength revealed by the hostile force. Perhaps it was only a hundred or two, but to me it seemed a thousand. When we passed the last of these people I was thankful, and the deeper we plowed into the darkness beyond them the better I felt. I came nearer and nearer to feeling good, for an hour; then we found the bridge still standing, and I felt entirely good. We crossed it and destroyed it, and then I feltbut I cannot describe what I felt. One has to feel it himself in order to know what it is like.|$|E
6000|$|The {{night was}} now black-dark; as is usual after a battle, {{it had begun}} to rain. Still we moved; we were being put into {{position}} by somebody. Inch by inch we crept along, treading on one another's heels by way of keeping together. Commands were passed along the line in whispers; more commonly none were given. When the men had pressed so closely together that they could advance no farther they stood stock-still, sheltering the locks of their rifles with their ponchos. In this position many fell asleep. When those in front suddenly stepped away those in the rear, roused by the tramping, hastened after with such zeal that the line was soon choked again. Evidently {{the head of the}} division was being piloted at a snail's pace by some one who did not feel sure of his ground. Very often we struck our feet against the dead; more frequently against those who still had spirit enough to resent it with a moan. These were lifted carefully to one side and abandoned. Some had sense enough to ask in their weak way for water. Absurd! Their clothes were soaken, their hair dank; their white faces, dimly discernible, were clammy and cold. Besides, none of us had any water. There was plenty coming, though, for before midnight a thunderstorm broke upon us with great violence. The rain, which had for hours been a dull drizzle, fell with a copiousness that stifled us; <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> <b>in</b> running water up to our ankles. Happily, we were in a forest of great trees heavily [...] "decorated" [...] with Spanish moss, or with an enemy standing to his guns the disclosures of the lightning might have been inconvenient. As it was, the incessant blaze enabled us to consult our watches and encouraged us by displaying our numbers; our black, sinuous line, creeping like a giant serpent beneath the trees, was apparently interminable. I am almost ashamed to say how sweet I found the companionship of those coarse men.|$|E
