2500|$|A United States Congressional General Accounting Office team {{reported}} the Somali government's {{response to the}} SNM attack as follows:The Somali army reportedly responded to the SNM attacks in May 1988 with extreme force, inflicting heavy civilian casualties and damages to Hargeisa and Burao....The Somali military resorted to using artillery and aerial shelling in heavily populated urban centres {{in its effort to}} retake Burao and Hargeisa. A majority of the refugees <b>we</b> <b>interviewed</b> stated that their homes were destroyed by shelling despite the absence of SNM combatants from their neighbourhoods....The refugees told similar stories of bombings, strafings, and artillery shelling in both cities and, in Burao, the use of armored tanks. The majority saw their houses either damaged or destroyed by the shelling. Many reported seeing members of their families killed in the barrage....Refugee interviews conducted by Africa Watch described how the government separated the non-Isaaqs from the Isaaqs before the attack was initiated:As soon as the fighting broke out, the government used loudspeakers to sort the civilians out into Darood and Isaak. They would shout, [...] "Who is from Galkayo? Mogadishu? Las Anod? Garoe?" [...] They appealed to the non-Isaaks to leave so they could burn the town and all those who remained behind. Most of the people from these towns left; the government provided them with transportation.|$|E

'If you were Scotch,' he added, 'I could go through the ceremony at once, of course; and then you could apply to the sheriff to-night for leave to register the marriage in proper form afterward: but as one of you is English, and the other I judge'--he smiled and glanced towards Harold--'an Indian-born subject of Her Majesty, it would be impossible for me to do it: the ceremony would be invalid, under Lord Brougham's Act, without previous residence.' ...|$|E

60|$|The {{attitude}} of the people behind the firing line should give one confidence. I had heard that the Italians were a nervous people. It {{does not apply to}} this part of Italy. As I approached the danger spot I saw rows of large, fat gentlemen with long thin black cigars leaning against walls in the sunshine. The general atmosphere would have steadied an epileptic. Italy is perfectly sure of herself in this quarter. Finally, after a long drive of winding gradients, always beside the Adige, we reached Ala, where <b>we</b> <b>interviewed</b> the Commander of the Sector, a man who has done splendid work during the recent fighting. 'By all means you can see my front. But no motorcar, please. It draws fire and others may be hit beside you.' We proceeded on foot therefore along a valley which branched at the end into two passes. In both very active fighting had been going on, and as we came up the guns were baying merrily, waking up most extraordinary echoes in the hills. It was difficult to believe that it was not thunder. There was one terrible voice that broke out {{from time to time in}} the mountains--the angry voice of the Holy Roman Empire. When it came all other sounds died down into nothing. It was--so I was told--the master gun, the vast 42 centimetre giant which brought down the pride of Liége and Namur. The Austrians have brought one or more from Innsbruck. The Italians assure me, however, as we have ourselves discovered, that in trench work beyond a certain point the size of the gun makes little matter.|$|E
6000|$|This man, whose usual duty {{apparently}} consisted in {{sitting behind}} a little table in an outer room of Consular offices, when ordered to assist {{me in my}} search for Johnson displayed lots of energy and a marvellous amount of local knowledge of a sort. But he did not conceal an immense and sceptical contempt for the whole business. We explored together on that afternoon an infinity of infamous grog shops, gambling dens, opium dens. We walked up narrow lanes where our gharry--a tiny box of a thing on wheels, attached to a jibbing Burmah pony--could by no means have passed. The constable {{seemed to be on}} terms of scornful intimacy with Maltese, with Eurasians, with Chinamen, with Klings, and with the sweepers attached to a temple, with whom he talked at the gate. <b>We</b> <b>interviewed</b> also through a grating in a mud wall closing a blind alley an immensely corpulent Italian, who, the ex-sergeant-major remarked to me perfunctorily, had [...] "killed another man last year." [...] Thereupon he addressed him as [...] "Antonio" [...] and [...] "Old Buck," [...] though that bloated carcase, apparently more than half filling the sort of cell wherein it sat, recalled rather a fat pig in a stye. Familiar and never unbending, the sergeant chucked--absolutely chucked--under the chin a horribly wrinkled and shrivelled old hag propped on a stick, who had volunteered some sort of information: and with the same stolid face he kept up an animated conversation with the groups of swathed brown women, who sat smoking cheroots on the door-steps of a long range of clay hovels. We got out of the gharry and clambered into dwellings airy like packing crates, or descended into places sinister like cellars. We got in, we drove on, we got out again for the sole purpose, as it seemed, of looking behind a heap of rubble. The sun declined; my companion was curt and sardonic in his answers, but it appears we were just missing Johnson all along. At last our conveyance stopped once more with a jerk, and the driver jumping down opened the door.|$|E

Women, in general found it more difficult with many ultimately choosing a shortlist rather than one single book." [...] "The men <b>we</b> <b>interviewed</b> had a tendency towards identifying themselves with angst-ridden books showing intellectual struggle, violence, personal vulnerability, catastrophe and the struggle to rise above circumstance." [...] The books most frequently cited by men in this study included The Outsider by Albert Camus, The Lord of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, and—the only book written by a female that made the list of [...] "top twenty" [...] inspirational books for men -- To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee.

However, today, we lack a holistic, contextual, and real-world understanding of software engineering expertise. In this dissertation, we address this gap by investigating the thesis: “Experts involved in the creation of software view software engineering expertise as holistically encompassing internal personality attributes, attributes regarding engagement with others, in addition to technical capabilities in designing and writing code. Furthermore, the ability to make good decisions (e. g. choosing what software to write and how to write), which has not yet been articulated by previous research studies, is also critically important. The key aspects of being a great software engineer are: writing good code, adjusting behaviors to account for future values and costs, practicing informed decision-making, avoiding making others’ jobs harder, and learning continuously. ” <b>We</b> <b>interview</b> 59 expert Microsoft software engineers to inductively understand what software engineering expertise entailed.
