25|$|Most {{mass transit}} systems move people in groups over {{scheduled}} routes. This has inherent inefficiencies. For passengers, time is wasted by <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> vehicle to arrive, indirect routes to their destination, stopping for passengers with other destinations, and often confusing or inconsistent schedules. Slowing and accelerating large weights can undermine public transport's {{benefit to the}} environment while slowing other traffic.|$|E

25|$|The microfilariae {{circulate}} in {{the bloodstream}} {{for as long as}} two years, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> stage in their lifecycles in the gut of a bloodsucking mosquito. When ingested by a mosquito, the microfilariae undergo a series of molts to the infective third larval stage, and then migrate to the salivary glands of the mosquito, where they wait to infect another host. The incubation period required to reach the stage where the microfilariae become transmittable to another host can be as little as two weeks or as long as six weeks, depending on the warmth of the climate, and the larval lifecycle ceases entirely if the ambient temperature drops below 14°C (57°F).|$|E
25|$|Von Janowski {{showed up}} at the New Carlisle Hotel at 06:30 asking for a room with a bath. The son of the hotel manager, Earle Annett Jr., noticed that the {{stranger}} seemed preoccupied and quickly noticed some inconsistencies in his story. The man said he took the bus that morning before walking to the hotel, but the bus was not going through New Carlisle that day, and even if it had, it would have dropped him off at the hotel. Annett also noticed that he spoke English with a Parisian accent, his clothing had European styling, and that he paid for his cigarettes with an obsolete Canadian dollar bill that had not been in circulation for quite some time. The stranger also had a strange smell on him; he was using Belgian matches that did not carry the Canadian government seal that was applied to matchbooks at the time. Less than three hours after his arrival and before Annett could confirm his suspicions, the stranger paid his bill and {{made his way to the}} train station where he had a coffee while <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> train.|$|E

25|$|In many cases, an {{objection}} {{to a request}} for unanimous consent will compel a vote. While forcing a single vote {{may not be an}} effective delaying tool, the cumulative effect of several votes, which take at least 15 minutes apiece, can be substantial. In addition to objecting to routine requests, senators can force votes through motions to adjourn and through quorum calls. Quorum calls are meant to establish {{the presence or absence of}} a constitutional quorum, but senators routinely use them to waste time while <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> speaker to come to the floor or for leaders to negotiate off the floor. In those cases, a senator asks for unanimous consent to dispense with the quorum call. If another senator objects, the clerk must continue to call the roll of senators, just as they would with a vote. If a call shows no quorum, the minority can force another vote by moving to request or compel the attendance of absent senators. Finally, senators can force votes by moving to adjourn, or by raising specious points of order and appealing the ruling of the chair.|$|E
25|$|When the National Wrestling Alliance Board of Directors {{decided to}} finally endorse a NWA World Tag Team Championship in 1992 they {{reached out to}} World Championship Wrestling to {{organize}} the initial tournament as well give them the rights to control the championship on a day-to-day basis. WCW pulled together a 16-team tournament that saw seven teams made up of regular WCW competitors as well as teams from various countries such as Japan, Mexico, Canada and more. The eight matches {{of the first round}} all took place on June 16, 1992 at WCW's Clash of the Champions XIX. During the show WCW started a storyline feud between WCW's top tag team, the Steiner Brothers, and the favorite non-WCW team of Steve Williams and Terry Gordy, who {{had been one of the}} top teams in Japan for years prior to the tournament. During the show Gordy and Williams attacked the Steiners' opponents prior to the match, leading to the Steiners winning by forfeit. During the show the Steiners challenged Gordy and Williams to face them in the second round that night instead of <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> round. In the main event of the Clash of Champions Gordy and Williams defeated the Steiner Brothers to advance to the semi-finals. In the month between the first round and the rest of the tournament Gordy and Williams defeated the Steiner Brothers to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

In mid-1999, Meshuggah performed in several Swedish concerts.

500|$|They {{spent most}} of the war patrolling the North Sea, and participated in most of the battles there, {{although}} only New Zealand was in the United Kingdom when the war began. Indefatigable was in the Mediterranean where she pursued the German warships [...] and [...] as they fled towards Turkey and Australia was flagship of the Royal Australian Navy in Australian waters where she helped to secure the German Pacific colonies and searched, unsuccessfully, for the German East Asia Squadron before sailing for the United Kingdom in December 1914. New Zealand participated in a number of the early actions in the North Sea including the Battle of Heligoland Bight and the inconclusive Scarborough Raid. Australia was still under repair after a collision with New Zealand before the Battle of Jutland so only Indefatigable and New Zealand were present where the former was destroyed by a magazine explosion. Both Australia and New Zealand spent much uneventful time at sea after Jutland <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> appearance of the High Seas Fleet, but that had been forbidden by the Kaiser. New Zealand conducted Admiral Jellicoe on his tour of India and the Dominions after the war while Australia returned home where she again became the flagship of the Royal Australian Navy. New Zealand was sold for scrap in 1922 while Australia only lasted two years more before being scuttled to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.|$|E
500|$|Natalie Finn from E! Online was {{disappointed}} with the track, feeling that although the releases from Born This Way were not that [...] "catchy", {{all of them were}} about the same subject of [...] "the importance of being ourselves.

Or even the next 'Just Dance' to really make us want to dance." [...] Jason Lipshultz from Billboard felt that the track was another anthem for individualism, with Gaga's hair used as a metaphor for her wild personality. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave a mixed review stating that the song is a [...] "derivative but perfectly serviceable club track about highlights that's turned into a dumping ground for every bad idea Gaga's had in the last 12 months: schmaltzy piano-woman melodies, overwrought choruses, inexplicable sax solos." [...] Rick Fulton, while writing in the Daily Record, called [...] "Hair" [...] a [...] "great tune" [...] and an [...] "Europop high-energy epic", while giving it four out of five points. Ian Hope from [...] BBC Online described [...] "Hair" [...] as an [...] "empowering freeway rocker about self expression." [...] The Independent writer Andy Gill compared the song to those by guitarist David Crosby, and described it as a statement of rebellious individuality. According to Los Angeles Times Randall Roberts, Gaga [...] "celebrates her follicles" [...] in the song.|$|E

500|$|MTV writer Josh Wigler {{thought the}} episode [...] "nearly put [...] to sleep," [...] {{as it was}} [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "a bit of a dud". The episode however did lead Wigler to [...] "start dig" [...] Sam Weiss, and also to enjoying Olivia's subplot, but {{believed}} the episode's monster-of-the-week {{could have been used}} to actually parallel her trauma; Wigler appreciated how the Fringe case tied into Walter and Peter's backstories. He concluded, [...] "It wasn't bad enough to make me concerned for the future of Fringe or anything, but it certainly didn't keep me {{on the edge of my}} seat <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> crazy twist like last week. I'm still loving this season, but tonight's episode was one of the weaker outings." [...] Newsarama's Chanel Reeder stated [...] "Dream Logic" [...] "certainly put the brakes on the speed that Fringe had gained in the previous" [...] episode, but praised the connection with Peter's past as [...] "one of the most interesting underlying parts". Reeder's favorite part was Sam Weiss, calling him [...] "a fantastic dimension to the show". Josie Kafka of Open Salon was more positive than other reviewers, and in particular highlighted the episode's humor, [...] "Almost all of the Cambridge scenes were funny: Astrid and Walter have a great rapport, especially when there's a rube in the room for them to play with." [...] She concluded [...] "I liked this one, more for the great Peter/Olivia and Walter/Astrid stuff than the plot of the week," [...] and gave the episode [...] "Three out of four anagrams".|$|E
