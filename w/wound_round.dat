25|$|In his 1961 book The Atom and its Nucleus, Gamow {{proposed}} {{representing the}} periodic {{system of the}} chemical elements as a continuous tape, with the elements in order of atomic number <b>wound</b> <b>round</b> in a three-dimensional helix whose diameter increased stepwise (corresponding to the longer rows of the conventional periodic table).|$|E
25|$|Floral (millefiori) and spiral patterns: This was {{produced}} by binding rods of coloured glass together and heating and fusing them into a single piece. These were then cut in cross-section, and the resulting discs could be fused together to create complex patterns. Alternately, two strips of contrasting-coloured glass could be fused together, and then <b>wound</b> <b>round</b> a glass rod whilst still hot to produce a spiral pattern. Cross-sections of this were also cut, and could be {{fused together to form}} a plate or fused to plain glass.|$|E

25|$|Common sails {{consist of}} a lattice {{framework}} on which a sailcloth is spread. The miller can adjust the amount of cloth spread according {{to the amount of}} wind available and power needed. In medieval mills, the sailcloth was wound {{in and out of a}} ladder type arrangement of sails. Postmedieval mill sails had a lattice framework over which the sailcloth was spread, while in colder climates, the cloth was replaced by wooden slats, which were easier to handle in freezing conditions. The jib sail is commonly found in Mediterranean countries, and consists of a simple triangle of cloth <b>wound</b> <b>round</b> a spar.|$|E
500|$|The khan wore a green satin robe; his hair, {{which was}} ten feet long, was free. A band of white silk <b>wound</b> <b>round</b> his {{forehead}} and hung down behind. The ministers of the presence, numbering two hundred in number, all wearing embroidered robes, stood on his right and left. The rest of his military retinue [...] clothed in fur, serge and fine wool, the spears and standards and bows in order, and the riders of camels and horses stretched far out of [...]|$|E
2500|$|The potters used slab-built {{construction}} and the [...] "coiling" [...] method, which involved working the clay {{into a long}} string which was <b>wound</b> <b>round</b> to form a shape and then modeled to form smooth walls, as the potter's wheel was not used by pre-contact Native Americans. Some decoration of the clay was done at this stage by incising, defenstrating, adding shapes, or stamping designs into the wet clay. After the works had dried sufficiently, it was heated in a wood fire.|$|E

40|$|Wound {{healing in}} the skin depends upon the {{availability}} of appropriate trace metals as enzyme cofactors and structural components in tissue repair. The present study {{is a part of}} a series of experimental investigations to examine the influence of Bentonite on skin wound healing. Surgically induced skin wounds in 48 young adult male rats were exposed topically to Bentonite (12 <b>round</b> <b>wound</b> and 12 incisional wound) and control <b>wounds</b> (12 <b>round</b> <b>wound</b> and 12 incisional wound) received de-ionized water only. Skin <b>wounds</b> (<b>round</b> and incisional) treated with Bentonite exhibited no significant difference in margins with erythema and edematous changes. Scab and wound debris was more extensive and persisted for at least 7 days after surgery in control group (P < 0. 05). Skin wounds exposed to Bentonite exhibited a mild retarded re-epithelialization, the treatment wounds were characterized by a prominent central mass of inflammatory cells, cell debris and wound exudate. The intense infiltrate of lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes and fibroblasts extended from the wound margin into the region of the panniculus carnosus muscle and hypodermis. Vascular dilatation and dermal oedema were prominent features of these wounds. External utilization of Bentonite for wound healing is safe and feasible, and we finalized that macroscopic healing of wound that treated by Bentonite was superior versus control group...|$|R

6000|$|Trooper Alexander Main, 2nd Scottish Horse: 'While {{lying on}} the ground, the Boers came close up and stood about fifteen to twenty yards away from where we were lying <b>wounded</b> <b>round</b> the guns. All were wounded at this time, {{and no one was}} firing. I saw the Boers there fire at the wounded. Captain Lloyd, a staff officer, was lying beside me wounded in the leg at this time; he {{received}} one or two more shots in the body, and shortly afterwards he died. I myself received three more wounds.' ...|$|R
