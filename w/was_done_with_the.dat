5|$|In late 2007 {{and early}} 2008, several Russian newspapers, {{including}} Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Komsomolskaya Pravda, and Nezavisimaya Gazeta printed stories that implicated the Nazis in the crime, spurring concern that this <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> tacit {{approval of the}} Kremlin. As a result, the Polish Institute of National Remembrance decided to open its own investigation.|$|E
5|$|Bastei Verlag, enamoured by {{the success}} of Bessy, asked Vandersteen to provide a second weekly series. With the {{popularity}} of superheroes, especially Batman, in Belgium and Germpany in these years, Vandersteen proposed a spinoff series of Suske en Wiske, based on Jerom, the strongman of the series. Called Wastl in German, 173 stories were produced between 1968 and 1972, with a publication that reached 150,000 copies at its summit. The best of these stories were published in Dutch as well, just like it <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> later Bessys, but the weakness of the stories ended the series after only four years.|$|E
5|$|On April 12, 1865, Booth {{heard the}} news that Robert E. Lee had {{surrendered}} at Appomattox Court House. He told Louis J. Weichmann, a friend of John Surratt and a boarder at Mary Surratt's house, that he <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> stage {{and that the only}} play he wanted to present henceforth was Venice Preserv'd. Weichmann did not understand the reference; Venice Preserv'd is about an assassination plot. Booth's scheme to kidnap Lincoln was no longer feasible with the Union Army's capture of Richmond and Lee's surrender, and he changed his goal to assassination.|$|E

5|$|By 1926 Joyce had {{completed}} the first {{two parts of the}} book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine transition. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on the new book, but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including {{the death of his father}} in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia, and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> assistance of younger admirers, including Samuel Beckett. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend James Stephens to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.|$|E
5|$|For {{the scenery}} design, layout {{supervisor}} Rasoul Azadani took many {{pictures of his}} hometown of Isfahan, Iran for guidance. Other inspirations for design were Disney's animated films from the 1940s and 50s and the 1940 film The Thief of Bagdad. The coloring <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> computerized CAPS process, and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality â€“ the protagonists use light colors such as blue, the antagonists darker ones such as red and black, and Agrabah and its palace use the neutral color yellow. Computer animation was used for some elements of the film, such as the tiger entrance of the Cave of Wonders and the scene where Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave.|$|E
5|$|On December 24, 2014, the PTC {{announced}} it was going forward with plans to replace the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel. Six options are being considered, three of which would include building bypasses via rock blasting (like what <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Laurel Hill Tunnel) while the other three would include boring two new tunnels, presumably three lanes each to accommodate the PTC's long-term plans to widen the entire mainline turnpike to six lanes except at the existing tunnels. If the PTC goes through with building new tunnels, the existing Allegheny Mountain Tunnels would be shut down. Although the projected costs for building a bypass would be {{less than half of}} the projected costs to bore new tunnels (as well as $3 million in annual maintenance on each tunnel), the aforementioned hunting group opposes the bypass options. Funding has not been identified for the project, which would open to traffic in a best-case scenario in the early 2020s.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} first {{proposed}} in 2001, during the original {{run of the}} Bionicle toyline. Lego contacted multiple writers for the project, including original Bionicle contributors Bob Thompson and Alastair Swinnerton, and Hollywood writers Henry Gilroy and Greg Weisman. Production began in 2002, taking approximately a year to complete. A {{major part of the}} graphical design was adjusting the characters so they could work in human-like ways while still resembling the original toys. The music was composed by Nathan Furst, who used orchestral and tribal elements to create the score. Voice casting was handled by Kris Zimmerman, and the voicework <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> setting and mythos of Bionicle in mind.|$|E
5|$|The scandal {{which has}} likely done the {{greatest}} damage to Harding's reputation is Teapot Dome. Like {{most of the}} administration's scandals, it came to light after Harding's death, {{and he was not}} aware of the illegal aspects. Teapot Dome involved an oil reserve in Wyoming which was one of three set aside {{for the use of the}} Navy in a national emergency. There was a longstanding argument that the reserves should be developed; Wilson's first Interior Secretary Franklin Knight Lane was an advocate of this position. When the Harding administration took office, Interior Secretary Fall took up Lane's argument and Harding signed an executive order in May 1921 transferring the reserves from the Navy Department to Interior. This <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> consent of Navy Secretary Edwin C. Denby.|$|E
5|$|The day's battle {{began on}} 18 June 1815 at about 11a.m. with a French attack on Hougoumont from the south-west, led by Napoleon's brother Jerome. The French {{gained control of}} much of the chateau's park, but the Allies {{retained}} possession of the farmhouse and courtyard surrounds. Jerome continued his attempts to take the farmhouse throughout the day, making four or five assaults, most of which were repulsed by the defenders, who fired through loopholes, windows, and doorways. One assault at about 12.30p.m. breached the north gate, which had been left open to allow allied troop and supply movements. Sous-Lieutenant Legro, of the French 1st Light Infantry, broke through the wooden doors with an axe, allowing French soldiers to flood the courtyard. Graham's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel James Macdonnell, led his men through the melee in the courtyard to the gates, in an attempt to shut them against the pressing French. This <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> help of three officers (Captain Wyndham, Ensign Hervey, and Ensign Gooch), Corporal Graham, and a few other soldiers including Graham's brother Joseph. James Graham was the one to slot the bar in place. Flagstones, carts, and debris were then piled against the gates to hold them secure. The Frenchmen trapped within the courtyard were all killed, apart from a young drummer-boy.|$|E
