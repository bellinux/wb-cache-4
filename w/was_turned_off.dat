5|$|In {{reaction}} to the 2011–17 California drought, all of San Francisco's public fountains were shut off in order to conserve water. Vaillancourt Fountain <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> in 2014 for the drought, but after that drought ended, the Recreation and Park department cited lack of funds to make repairs to the Vaillancourt Fountain as the reason {{it had not been}} reactivated. The estimated cost of rehabilitation to allow water to flow again was approximately US$500,000.|$|E
5|$|WhitePages started {{developing}} {{features for}} business users around 2010. WhitePages Pro {{is used for}} things like verifying {{the identity of a}} sales lead, find fake form data in online forms and to check form data from consumers making a purchase against common indicators of fraud, like shipping to a mailbox at an unoccupied building. In 2016, advertising on WhitePages.com <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> in favor of selling monthly subscriptions that give users unlimited background checks and other records.|$|E
5|$|Cuban {{government}} officials issued a hurricane {{watch for the}} southern coastline on August 11, {{two days before the}} hurricane struck the island. This was upgraded to a hurricane warning on the 12th, 13 ½ hours before Charley made landfall. Because of the threat, the government issued a mandatory evacuation for 235,000citizens and 159,000animals {{in the area of the}} expected impact. An additional 3,800residents were evacuated from offshore islands, while 47,000 in Havana were transported from old, unsafe buildings to safer areas. The people were transported to shelters provisioned with supplies. In addition, the power grid in southern Cuba <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> to avoid accidents.|$|E
50|$|Either or both {{subcarrier}}s could <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> {{when not}} needed, e.g., the voice subcarrier could <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> during astronaut sleep periods. This improved the signal margins {{for the other}} information streams such as telemetry data.|$|R
50|$|Further, the TMC {{intends to}} have sewer, water, and {{electricity}} service disconnected at all illegal {{buildings in the}} district. Water and sewer {{should be able to}} <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> immediately; TMC <b>is</b> requesting that electricity <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> by the electric service.|$|R
50|$|On February 11, 1989, work ceased at the site, and {{the pumps}} <b>were</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> The hole {{filled with water}} overnight. After the pumps <b>were</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> the site <b>was</b> filled back in {{so that it would}} not be a hazard to humans.|$|R
5|$|The Department of Civil Aviation {{performed}} {{tests on}} {{parts of the}} DC-4 fuel system. Tests on the engine fuel system showed that when the engine boost pump was operating, a vortex formed in the engine fuel tank. If {{a small amount of}} water was present, this vortex held the water in suspension and prevented it from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> the vortex dissipated and any water would soon find its way into the engine. Investigators believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off.|$|E
5|$|The water <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> at the {{fountain}} from 2001 until 2004, reopening on August 2, 2004. San Francisco estimated {{the cost of}} electricity was approximately US$200,000 per year to operate {{the fountain}}. Peskin negotiated a public-private partnership where the city {{would pay for the}} operating costs (at a revised estimate of US$76,000 per year) and Boston Properties would pay for maintenance (estimated at US$20,000 per year). The fountain was shut off again during the winter of 2007–08 starting in November 2007 so that skaters at the Justin Herman Plaza ice rink would not be splashed. It reopened on January 21, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} {{the end of}} the second queue, guests were loaded into test cars. Upon dispatching from the loading dock, the car was brought through an accelerated hill climb. Next, the car's suspension was tested over different types of road surfaces, including German and Belgian blocks & cobblestones. Next, the car's anti-lock braking system <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> and the car tried to navigate a course of cones, knocking many over in the process. The anti-lock brakes were then turned back on and a similar cone course was navigated easily. Guests were shown a video overlay of the difference. Then, the cars were brought through 3 environmental chambers: a heat chamber, a cold chamber, and a corrosion chamber.|$|E
50|$|The station <b>was</b> <b>turning</b> <b>off</b> {{large numbers}} of cattle since the early 1900s, 1,100 <b>were</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> via Hergott Springs in 1905 and another 1,260 being droved to Oodnadatta in 1910. Large number of cattle have been {{produced}} of the property since.|$|R

5|$|During 1997, {{there were}} five {{incidents}} where NSB's Nordic Mobile Telephone equipment interfered with the locomotive's electronics, causing the emergency brakes to activate. This caused a temporary halt until the motorman had unlocked the brakes. The problem was fixed by moving NSB's mobile senders. The units were taken into use on the Bergen Line from 5 January 1997. Later they entered into use on the Dovre and Sørland Lines, and then on regional trains around Oslo, such as the Vestfold Line. In August 1998, NSB stated that El 18 used more power {{than some of the}} substation transformers along the line could handle, particularly along the Vestfold Line. Part of the problem was caused by a mechanism in the locomotives whereby the motor <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> if the wheels spin. The result was that the full power output of the El 18 along parts of the railway network could not be utilized.|$|E
5|$|In April 1951 Justice Simpson {{advised the}} Minister for Civil Aviation that new {{evidence}} had become available. The Minister gave permission for the Inquiry to be re-opened. The Inquiry re-opened in Melbourne on 4 June 1951. The Department of Civil Aviation had recently completed {{tests on the}} DC-4 fuel system. The tests showed that when an engine boost pump was operating, a vortex in the engine fuel tank prevented water from entering the engine. The tests also showed that when the boost pump <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> any water would soon {{find its way into}} the engine. The Department of Civil Aviation believed this might explain why all engines were operating normally during the takeoff but at least one engine began to run roughly around the time the engine boost pumps would be turned off. However, Justice Simpson stated that the re-opened Inquiry served only to confirm his view that the Amana's loss of power was not due to water in the fuel.|$|E
5|$|The main {{intention}} of the tour was to transform Madonna's old hits musically and display her capacity for transformation and self-reflection. The tour was initially known as the Whore of Babylon World Tour, although Madonna later denied using this name. The idea was to portray Madonna as the Whore of Babylon, the figure of evil as mentioned in the Book of Revelation. However it was later changed to the Re-Invention World Tour, {{to make it a}} self-confident dig at all the critics and people who have expressed their views about Madonna re-inventing her image over the years. The official tour poster displayed Madonna in a vintage bolero gown and a large French Renaissance-like hair-bun. Air-conditioning <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> during the tour on Madonna's request as she claimed it dried up her throat during singing.|$|E

5|$|To {{meet the}} game's {{projected}} release date of December 19, 1986, {{the staff members}} worked overtime and often stayed in the office at night. They used torn cardboard boxes as beds, and covered themselves in curtains to resist the low temperatures of the unheated development building. Eventually, Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena was finished and entered production a mere {{three days before the}} release date. Several ideas for additional stages had to be dropped because of these scheduling conflicts. In February and July 1987, respectively, a cartridge-based version was published for the NES in Europe and North America under the name Kid Icarus. For this release, the graphics of the ending were updated, and staff credits were added to the game. Unlike Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena, which saves the player's progress on the Disk Card, Kid Icarus uses a password system to return to a game after the console <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> In August 2004, Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena was re-released as part of the Famicom Mini Disk System Selection for the Game Boy Advance. The game was published internationally for the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007. The North American, European and Australian versions of this digital release have the cheat codes of the NES version removed.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry and hot weather. Michael Schumacher clinched his ninth pole position of the season, his second at the circuit, with a time of 1:37.397. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Häkkinen who recorded a lap time 0.463 seconds slower than the pole sitter. Coulthard qualified third and suffered a worrying moment when a fire on his McLaren caused petrol to seep into his eye and admitted the incident could have escalated if not dealt with quickly. Barrichello, who was still suffering from flu, qualified fourth having been pushed from second position in the closing seconds of the session. Wurz qualified fifth, in his best qualifying performance of the season. Villeneuve secured the sixth fastest time despite having to walk to the pit lane when his BAR's engine <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> on his final run. Irvine made changes to his set-up and secured seventh although he believed he could have been quicker as he backed off through turn 15. Ralf Schumacher lost four-tenths of a second on his fastest lap and managed eighth. Trulli and Frentzen rounded out the top ten qualifying positions for Jordan. Zonta missed qualifying in the top ten by two-tenths of a second and lost time with a braking issue. Herbert, in his final Formula One race, qualified twelfth and struggled with understeer following an engine change. He was ahead of Fisichella, de la Rosa and Verstappen. Jenson Button qualified 16th and encountered traffic during the session which prevented him from setting a faster lap time. The Sauber, Prost and Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid, covering positions 17 to 22.|$|E

5000|$|This {{stored charge}} can {{remain in the}} {{capacitors}} {{for a long time}} after the unit has <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off.</b> It can <b>be</b> a potentially lethal shock hazard for the user or maintenance and servicing personnel, who may believe that because the device <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> or unplugged it is safe. Therefore, to discharge the capacitor after the supply has <b>been</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> a large-value resistor is connected across its terminals. After it is switched off, the charge on the capacitor will drain off through this [...] "bleeder resistor", causing the voltage to decay quickly to safe levels.|$|R

25|$|On June 20, 2009, {{a filter}} pump on Bahari River malfunctioned, sending twenty-four guests and {{employees}} to the hospital. At 6:25 pm, the pump, which <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> at the time, was turned back on. The pump surged, forcing a stronger than usual concentration of liquid bleach and hydrochloric acid into the water. Twenty-four people, including park staff and medical personnel, complained of troubled breathing and nausea. They were given oxygen at the park before being transported to Jasper Memorial Hospital for treatment. All were treated and released that evening. It was later determined that an interlock system designed to prevent chemical feeders from pumping chemicals into the water when the pump <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> had malfunctioned.|$|E
