50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{inclusions}}: linear inclusions and rounded inclusions. Inclusions can be either isolated or cumulative. Linear inclusions occur when there is slag or flux in the <b>weld.</b> <b>Slag</b> forms from the use of a flux, which is why this type of defect usually occurs in welding processes that use flux, such as shielded metal arc welding, flux-cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding, but it can also occur in gas metal arc welding. This defect usually occurs in welds that require multiple passes and there is poor overlap between the welds. The poor overlap does not allow the slag from the previous weld to melt out and rise {{to the top of the}} new weld bead. It can also occur if the previous weld left an undercut or an uneven surface profile. To prevent slag inclusions the slag should be cleaned from the weld bead between passes via grinding, wire brushing, or chipping.|$|E

30|$|Environmental {{management}} {{in developing countries}} is a complex issue because environmental problems are linked with social and economic aspects, which {{must be considered in}} the development of any environmental program or regulation [9]. The problem of waste accumulation exists worldwide, specifically in the densely populated areas [10]. Scale, granulated slag, and steel chips are industrial wastes in the iron and steel industry and cause a nuisance both to the health and environment when not properly disposed [7]. Reuse of industrial solid waste as a partial replacement of aggregate in construction activities not only saves landfill space but also reduces the demand for extraction of natural raw materials [8]. Recent studies showed that slag can also replace with sand in concrete [11, 12, 13]. So, the present study focuses to replace sand by <b>welding</b> <b>slag</b> (WS) and furnace slag (FS) in the production of concrete. Properties of aggregates and slag were studied in detail.

40|$|A {{discovery}} Unreviewed Safety Question (USQ) {{was declared}} on the underground waste storage tanks at the Hanford Site in May 1996. The USQ was for condensed-phase organic-nitrate reactions (sometimes called organic complexant reactions) in the tanks. This paper outlines the steps taken {{to close the}} USQ, and resolve the related safety issue. Several processes were used at the Hanford Site to extract and/or process plutonium. These processes resulted in organic complexants (for chelating multivalent cations) and organic extraction solvents {{being sent to the}} underground waste storage tanks. This paper addresses the organic complexant hazard. The organic complexants are in waste matrices that include inert material, diluents, and potential oxidizers. In the presence of oxidizing material, the complexant salts can be made to react exothermically by heating to high temperatures or by applying an external ignition source of sufficient energy. The first organic complexant hazard assessments focused on determining whether a hulk runaway reaction could occur, similar to the 1957 accident at Kyshtm (a reprocessing plant in the former U. S. S. R.). Early analyses (1977 through 1994) examined organic-nitrate reaction onset temperatures and concluded that a bulk runaway reaction could not occur at the Hanford Site because tank temperatures were well below that necessary for bulk runaway. Therefore, it was believed that organic-nitrate reactions were adequately described in the then current Authorization Basis (AB). Subsequent studies examined a different accident scenario, propagation resulting from an external ignition source (e. g., lightning or <b>welding</b> <b>slag)</b> that initiates a combustion front that propagates through the organic waste. A USQ evaluation determined that localized high energy ignition sources were credible, and that point source ignition of organic complexant waste was not adequately addressed i n the then existing AB. Consequently, the USQ was declared on the underground storage tanks in May 1996 for condensed-phase organic-nitrate reactions. At {{the same time that the}} operating contractor recommended that the U. S.

30|$|Characters {{are one of}} {{the main}} methods for {{information}} identification, recording, and storage. Metal stamping characters (MSCs) are widely used in the identification of industrial products because they are hard to alter and permanently preserved. The high-quality automation of character recognition on industrial products is highly desirable in the manufacturing and periodic inspection of these products. Inspection is performed at various production stages. It is clear that the earlier method of using human inspectors, however, misses a considerable number of defects because humans are unsuitable for such simple and repetitive tasks. Automated vision inspection can be a good alternative to reduce human workload and labor costs as well as to improve inspection accuracy and throughput. Unfortunately, MSCs constantly change over time and vary through the manufacturing process flow. For example, spray paint and other similar processing cause the color of the characters to vary process by process. Because the colors of the MSCs are generally similar to the background, the contrast between the two regions is very low. Besides, annealing, incineration, and other processes, as well as stacking or service over the long term, will produce oxide scale or rust on the metal surface that further reduces the contrast between the characters and the background; sometimes, such characters are hard to distinguish even with the human eyes. Finally, hydraulic oil stains, shot-blasting process, the spatter of <b>welding</b> <b>slag,</b> electrostatic adsorption of iron powder, and other artifacts of the product manufacturing and service process also obscure the pressed characters and reduce the image quality. The traditional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques, such as text recognition [1 – 3], license plate recognition [4 – 6], and ID card identification [7, 8], have been developed for decades and achieved great success in different commercial systems. But most of them are designed for images with high quality and often fail to produce good results when applied for MSCs. To adapt to the development and promotion of intelligent manufacturing technology, achieving OCR for MSCs is particularly important.|$|R
5|$|Shielding gases are {{necessary}} for {{gas metal arc welding}} to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they come in contact with the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. This problem is common to all arc welding processes; for example, in the older Shielded-Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW), the electrode is coated with a solid flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by the arc. In GMAW, however, the electrode wire does not have a flux coating, and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect the <b>weld.</b> This eliminates <b>slag,</b> the hard residue from the flux that builds up after welding and must be chipped off to reveal the completed weld.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{examined the}} feasibility of using flux modification {{in the form of}} the addition of oxidizing ingredients to reduce the as-deposited hydrogen content of basic-type shielded metal arc welds. Additions of up to 16. 3 % micaceous iron oxide (MIO) to the flux formulation of an E 7018 - 1 type electrode lowered the diffusible weld hydrogen content by approximately 70 %. This can be attributed to the formation of oxygen, which lowers the partial pressure of hydrogen in the arc atmosphere, and the reaction of FeO (formed on dissociation of MIO) with hydrogen. The partitioning of deoxidizing elements (manganese and silicon) between the <b>weld</b> metal and <b>slag</b> on addition of MIO to the flux coating was also examined, but the influence of flux additions on the weld mechanical properties and the electrode operating characteristics was not evaluated during the course of this investigation...|$|R
500|$|The {{choice of}} {{electrode}} for SMAW {{depends on a}} number of factors, including the weld material, welding position and the desired weld properties.

Fast-fill electrodes are designed to melt quickly so that the welding speed can be maximized, while fast-freeze electrodes supply filler metal that solidifies quickly, making welding in a variety of positions possible by preventing the weld pool from shifting significantly before solidifying.|$|R

In detail, the 30 -mm thick parent material absorbs energy more than 105 J, satisfying the code requirement of 27 J at 0 o C in the Charpy impact tests. However, the welding heat causes the microstructure of HAZ to be notably coarse, reducing the Charpy value to 21 J.

50|$|Typically, {{the ends}} of the rails are cleaned, aligned flat and true, and spaced apart 25 mm. This gap between rail ends for welding is to ensure {{consistent}} results in the pouring of the molten steel into the weld mold. In the event of a welding failure, the rail ends can be cropped to a 75 mm gap, removing the melted and damaged rail ends, and a new weld attempted with a special mould and larger thermite charge. A two or three piece hardened sand mould is clamped around the rail ends, and a torch of suitable heat capacity is used to preheat {{the ends of}} the rail and the interior of the mould. The proper amount of thermite with alloying metal is placed in a refractory crucible, and when the rails have reached a sufficient temperature, the thermite is ignited and allowed to react to completion (allowing time for any alloying metal to fully melt and mix, yielding the desired molten steel or alloy). The reaction crucible is then tapped at the bottom. Modern crucibles have a self-tapping thimble in the pouring nozzle. The molten steel flows into the mould, fusing with the rail ends and forming the <b>weld.</b> The <b>slag,</b> being lighter than the steel flows last from the crucible and overflows the mould into a steel catch basin, to be disposed of after cooling.

Typical time from start of the work until a train can run over the rail is approximately 45 minutes to more than an hour, depending on the rail size and ambient temperature.

This initiates the arc and thus the melting of the workpiece and the consumable electrode, and causes droplets of the electrode to be passed from the electrode to the weld pool. Striking an arc, which varies widely based upon electrode and workpiece composition, can be the hardest skill for beginners. The orientation of the electrode to workpiece is where most stumble, if the electrode is held at a perpendicular angle to the workpiece the tip will likely stick to the metal which will fuse the electrode to the workpiece which will cause it to heat up very rapidly. The tip of the electrode needs to be at a lower angle to the workpiece, which allows the weld pool to flow out of the arc. [...] As the electrode melts, the flux covering disintegrates, giving off shielding gases that protect the weld area from oxygen and other atmospheric gases. In addition, the flux provides molten slag which covers the filler metal as it travels from the electrode to the weld pool.
