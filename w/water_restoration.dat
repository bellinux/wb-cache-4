Due to the destructive nature of <b>water,</b> chosen <b>restoration</b> methods also depend heavily {{on the amount of}} water, and on the amount of time the water has remained stagnant. For example, as long as carpet has not been wet for longer than 48 hours, and the water involved was not sewage based, a carpet can usually be saved; however, if the water has soaked for longer, then the carpet is probably irreparable and will have to be replaced. <b>Water</b> damage <b>restoration</b> can be performed by property management teams, building maintenance personnel, or by the homeowners themselves; however, contacting a certified professional <b>water</b> damage <b>restoration</b> specialist is often regarded as the safest way to restore water damaged property.|$|R

40|$|Lake {{eutrophication}} is {{a serious}} global environmental issue. Phytoremediation is a promising, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly technology for <b>water</b> quality <b>restoration.</b> However, besides nutrient removal, macrophytes also deeply affect the hydrologic cycle of a lake system through evapotranspiration. Changes in hydrologic cycle caused by macrophytes have a great influence on lake <b>water</b> quality <b>restoration.</b> As {{a result of the}} two opposite effects of macrophytes on <b>water</b> quality <b>restoration</b> (i. e. an increase in macrophytes can increase nutrient removal and improve water quality while also increasing evapotranspiration, reducing water volume and consequently decreasing water quality), rational macrophyte control through planting and harvest is very important. In this study, a new approach is proposed to optimise the initial planting area and monthly harvest scheme of macrophytes for <b>water</b> quality <b>restoration.</b> The month-by-month effects of macrophyte management on lake water quality are considered. Baiyangdian Lake serves as a case study, using the common reed. It was found that water quality was closest to Grade III on the Chinese water quality scale when the reed planting area was 123 km 2 (40 % of the lake surface area) and most reeds would be harvested at the end of June. The optimisation approach proposed in this study will be a useful reference for lake restoration...|$|R

40|$|The State of Texas {{currently}} contains 568 water bodies considered impaired due {{to excessive}} pollutant loading. Of these, approximately 48 % are impaired due to {{elevated levels of}} fecal indicator bacteria from animals, birds and humans. Once impaired, efforts to restore water quality must be undertaken. This large number of bacteria impairments leaves the State with a sizable task ahead and presents a range of restoration challenges. Restoring all of these impaired water bodies is costly and resource intensive, thus prioritizing future <b>water</b> quality <b>restoration</b> efforts is a means to efficiently allocate available resources and achieve timely restoration results. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed the Recovery Potential Screening (RPS) tool to help prioritize <b>water</b> body <b>restoration</b> planning efforts (Norton et al. 2009). Built as a technical aid for states and government agencies, the RPS tool provides a systematic approach for comparing the relative restorability of water bodies.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of the laboratory investigation of the influence of high temperatures on water regime of red currant in Institute of Fruit Selection. It shows the dependence of water loss by leaves on the phenophase of plant development. High water loss by leaves occurs during the phase of ripening berries (July). Low water loss is noted during the active growth of shoots (June). Red currant genotypes: «Valentinovka», «Bayna» have a high percent of water loss in June and July. Genotypes «Shedraya», «Gollandskay krasnay», «Orlovchanka», «Dar Orla», «Selyanochka», «Osipovskay», «Belka» and «Jonker van Tets» have a low percent of loss water. The loss of water at the temperature shock is the important protective mechanism from over heat and death of plants. The results of the investigation of a degree of <b>water</b> <b>restoration</b> by red currant leaves in the periods of berry ripening and active growth of shoots are given. The most part of genotypes of red currant leaves have a high percent (> 50 %) of <b>water</b> <b>restoration.</b> Genotypes «Selyanochka»,«Orlovchanka», «Dana», «Shedraya», «Belka» have a more 100 % of <b>water</b> <b>restoration.</b> On the ground of the obtained results the following genotypes: «Belka», «Selyanochka», «Gollandskay krasnay», «Shedraya», «Orlovchanka», «Dar Orla», «Osipovskay» and «Jonker van Tets» are mostly heat resistant...|$|E

40|$|Enclosed please find five {{copies of}} an {{application}} for ground water Alternate Concentration Limits (ACLs) for the Shirley Basin mill and tailings site. Pathfinder requests that the NRC amend the above referenced license to incorporate the proposed ACLs. Pathfinder has been endeavoring for over fifteen years to accomplish a ground <b>water</b> <b>restoration</b> at the site with overall favorable results. Of the thirteen constituents assigned ground water protection standards in the license, only two continue to exceed the site standard limits: uranium and thorium- 230. While both of these parameters have been dramatically reduced in the ground water over the years, they remain at levels which have become very difficult to further reduce. Additionally, {{it is noteworthy that}} over the period of record these two constituents have routinely exceeded the site standards in the designated site background well. This would suggest that the site standards for uranium and thorium- 230 originally were set unrealistically low. We have concluded that we have essentially reached the point of ALARA relative to ground <b>water</b> <b>restoration</b> at the Shirley Basin site, prompting this application for ACLs.
