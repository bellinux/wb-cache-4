50|$|Christine and {{the farmers}} decided to {{sacrifice}} the next newborn, and the plague on the cattle ceased. When the birth came, Christine tried to steal {{it in order}} to give it to the devil, but the priest sprinkled it with holy water before she was able. Christine transformed into a spider, struck the priest and killed him. Then she began to terrorize the valley, killing both people and animals, including von Stoffeln and his knights. One night, the mother of a child who had been attacked grabbed the spider, stuck it in a hole in a <b>window</b> <b>post</b> she had prepared, and plugged the hole up. The woman also died from touching the spider, but peace and quiet returned to the valley.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{following}} centuries, {{the people of}} the valley initially led god-fearing lives, but over time many fell again into godless behavior. Finally, though, a malicious farmhand releases the spider, which kills almost all the inhabitants of the village. At the next birth, Christen, the master of the farmhand who released the spider, saves the child from the devil, captures the spider and returns it to its old prison. He pays for this service with his life, but he dies in [...] "God's Peace." [...] In the valley, peace and god-fearing are once again the order of the day. Although the house was rebuilt several times, the post was always put back in in order to preserve the old blessing.

The second hit the driver's side <b>window</b> <b>post</b> and fragmented, with one small piece hitting Platt in the scalp. The third hit Matix in the face, and fragmented in two, with neither piece causing a serious wound. The fourth hit Matix in the face next to his right eye socket, travelled downward through the facial bones, into the neck, where it entered the spinal column and severed the spinal cord. The fifth hit Matix in the face, penetrated the jaw bone and neck and came to rest by the spinal column. Mireles reached the driver's side door, extended his revolver through the window, and fired his sixth shot at Platt. The bullet penetrated Platt's chest and bruised the spinal cord, ending the gunfight.|$|E
5000|$|At {{present data}} relate only to full term infants, and all human studies of {{hypothermia}} treatment {{have so far}} been restricted to infants >36 weeks out of an expected 40 weeks gestation. There are both more potential side effects on the developing premature with lung disease, {{and there is more}} evident protection by hypothermia when a greater volume of complex brain is actively developing. During mid gestation to late term the fetal brain is undergoing increasingly complex progressive growth of first the mid-brain and then development of the cortex and [...] "higher" [...] centers. The effects of fetal asphyxia on the developing brain in sheep are dependent on gestational age with near term fetuses showing both less tolerance of asphyxia and maximal damage in the rapidly expanding cortex; while fetuses prior to the last third of development experience more extended tolerance of asphyxia with maximal effects on the growing mid-brain.

5000|$|The {{most common}} route of {{infection}} occurs orally, and occasionally through the respiratory tract from the nucleus of congenitally infected hatch mates. Experimental infection of adult chickens through the esophagus, nasal passages, or trachea caused the virus to spread throughout {{all areas of the}} enteric, respiratory tract, reproductive tract, and the hock and tendon joints. In an experiment, avian reovirus was recovered from mononuclear, plasma, and erythrocyte cell fractions of blood within 30 hours of infection in young chicks. After 3-5 days, the infection spread throughout the whole body. The main site of viral replication was observed in the enteric tract. A different study of early pathogenesis in chicks infected with virus one day after birth displayed that the bursa of Fabricius and the epithelial cells of the small intestines are the main sites of infection and portal of entry of the virus which quickly disseminates to other organs within a 24- to 48-hour <b>window</b> <b>post</b> infection. The tibiotarsal-tarsometatarsal (hock joint) was the site where virus replication caused the most severe damage and in some extreme cases, tendon rupture.|$|E

Peterbilt also made changes to the cab doors in late 2004 when the vent <b>window</b> <b>post</b> was eliminated and the mirrors moved from the door to the cab. (Interestingly the [...] "original cab" [...] from Fageol had no vent windows and thus a retro look was achieved). The passenger door received a much larger peep window. New door release handles and lock sets replaced the 1972 units. The 2005 models had a flat door window lower ledge. For 2006 and 2007 the doors received a new window with an angled-towards-the-hood lower ledge allowing for additional visibility, especially to the right. Rear corner windows also became available. The new for 2005 cab mounted mirrors allow for enhanced view and allow the driver to keep his view facing forward without leaning to see the mirror. The rear window of the cab saw changes from the original 36" [...] × 28" [...] window. The Unibilt Daycab window size became standard around 2003.|$|E

40|$|An {{estimated}} 30 % {{of individuals}} with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) remain minimally verbal into late childhood, but research on cognition and brain function in ASD focuses almost exclusively on those with good or only moderately impaired language. Here we present a case study investigating auditory processing of GM, a nonverbal child with ASD and cerebral palsy. At the age of 8 years, GM was tested using magnetoencephalography (MEG) whilst passively listening to speech and nonspeech sounds. Where typically developing children and verbal autistic children all demonstrated similar brain responses to speech and nonspeech sounds, GM produced much stronger responses to nonspeech than speech, particularly in the 65 – 165 ms (M 50 /M 100) time <b>window</b> <b>post</b> stimulus onset. GM was retested aged 10 years using electroencephalography (EEG). Consistent with her MEG results, she showed an unusually early and strong response to pure tone stimuli.

40|$|Abstract Purpose Chemotherapy {{increases}} {{survival in}} breast cancer patients. Consequently, cerebral metastases have recently become a significant clinical problem, with an incidence of 30 – 40 % among breast carcinoma patients. As this phenomenon cannot be studied longitudinally in humans, models which mimic brain metastasis are needed to investigate its pathogenesis. Such models may later be used in experimental therapeutic approaches. Material and methods/results We report a model in which 69 % of the animals (9 / 13 BALB/c nude mice) developed MR-detectable abnormal masses in the brain parenchyma within a 20 to 62 -day time <b>window</b> <b>post</b> intra-carotid injection of 435 -Br 1 human cells. The masses detected in vivo were either single (7 animals) or multiple (2 animals). Longitudinal MR (MRI/MRS) studies and post-mortem histological data were correlated, revealing a total incidence of experimental brain metastases of 85 % in the cases studied (11 / 13 animals). ADC maps perfectly differentiated edema and/or CSF areas from metastasis. Preliminary MRS data also revealed additional features: decrease in N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) was the first MRS-based marker of metastasis growth in the brain (micrometastasis); choline-containing compounds (Cho) rose and creatine (Cr) levels decreased as these lesions evolved, with mobile lipids and lactate also becoming visible. Furthermore, MRS pattern recognition-based analysis suggested that this approach may help to discriminate different growth stages. Conclusions This study paves the way for further in vivo studies oriented towards detection of different tumor progression states and for improving treatment efficiency. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{restoration}} of {{blood flow to}} ischemic myocardium is essential, however it causes further injury called reperfusion injury. Apoptosis contributes significantly to cardiomyocyte cell death during ischemia reperfusion injury, in which caspase family proteases play an essential role as they are the executioners of apoptosis. Caspase inhibitors showed promising cardioprotective results when administered before ischemia or {{at the start of}} reperfusion. However, before applying them in pre clinical studies of myocardial ischemia, several investigations needed to be taken to determine their therapeutic <b>window</b> <b>post</b> reperfusion, their effect on functional recovery of myocardium post ischemia, their mechanism of action. Methods Isolated perfused rat hearts were subjected to 35 min ischemia followed by 2 hr reperfusion where caspase inhibitors [broad spectrum caspase inhibitor (ZVAD, 0. 1 µM), specific caspase 3 inhibitor (DEVD, 0. 07 µM) ] were added at the start of reperfusion, 15, 30 and 60 min after starting reperfusion at {{the presence or absence of}} Wortmannin (WORT, 100 nM, PI 3 -kinase inhibitor). Hearts underwent triphenyl tetrazolium staining for infarct size assessment, or were frozen for Western blot analysis. Freshly isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes were subjected to 6 hr hypoxia followed by either 18 hr, where caspase inhibitors (ZVAD, 25 µM and DEVD, 25 µM) ] were added at the start of reoxygenation, 15, 30 and 60 min after starting reoxygenation at the presence or absence of Wortmannin (WORT, 100 nM). Cardiomyocytes were analysed for viability, apoptosis, necrosis and intracellular caspase- 3 activity using flow cytometry analysis. Isolated adult rat ventricular papillary muscles were subjected to 35 min hypoxia followed by 100 min reperfusion where caspase inhibitors [ZVAD (0. 1 µM, 2. 5 µM) and DEVD (2. 5 µM) ] were added at the start of reperfusion throughout.
