500|$|Although {{the band}} {{produced}} the album, Pekka stated that Antti {{was the main}} producer since he was present at {{every step of the}} production, including mixing and mastering. Because they were comfortable self-producing on all their previous albums, they refused to bring in an outside record producer for 12 Gauge. [...] "This concept has worked for us since the beginning and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to trust it. Everything goes easy with this setup and we don’t want any extra risk factors". Mastering for the disc took place at the Cutting Room in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E

Many hate crime victims are robbed afterward. We're not saying it wasn't a robbery; <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> a full investigation."

[...] He explained that they always try to do something different: [...] "We've got people still coming to see us for, you know, after ten years, and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to try and give something special."

500|$|Clinton [...] "Jack" [...] Macdonald became {{president}} of the park in 1957. In 1959, Macdonald and Lewis Davidson, a bagpipe director at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, started the Ligonier Highland Games, a Scottish highland games event held at the park. During the same year that he assumed control of the park, Macdonald was appointed as the first commissioner of the Scottish Clan Donald for Pennsylvania. The games, held annually in early September after the park had closed for the summer, became {{one of the largest and}} most highly regarded Scottish athletic and cultural competitions in the country. Jack Macdonald said of the Games: [...] "We're not interested in becoming one of the biggest Games. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to be one of the nicest." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite earning {{critical}} acclaim and a sizable fanbase, commercial success eluded the group. Early in their career, their 1993 EP Jenny Ondioline entered the UK Singles Chart, but financial issues prevented the band from printing enough records to satisfy demand. When Elektra Records was closed down by Warner Bros. Records in 2004, Stereolab was dropped {{along with many}} other artists, reportedly because of poor sales. Since then, Stereolab's self-owned label Duophonic has inked a worldwide distribution deal with independent label Too Pure. Through Duophonic the band both licenses their music and releases it directly (depending on geographic market). According to Tim Gane, [...] "...we license our recordings and just give them to people, then we don't have to ask for permission if we want to use it. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to be in control of our own music." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Sean Elliott of IFMagazine disliked the [...] "Scrappy-Doo {{qualities of the}} character". He {{compared}} Jo to Dawn Summers of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, feeling that she [...] "is always trying to help and always gets in the way". Fan reaction to the character was generally negative as well. Ackles summed up the response as, [...] "No, no, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> this {{to be about the}} boys." [...] Though Kripke believed that Tal was a [...] "terrific actress" [...] who [...] "did valiantly and beautifully with the part [...] gave her", he felt that introducing her as a love interest was a mistake and came to believe that women should only be introduced into the series as antagonists. The failure with Jo prompted the series writers to introduce Ruby the following season in an attempt to [...] "course-correct".|$|E

500|$|Kunzang Choden {{also made}} her Olympic debut at the 2012 games. She {{qualified}} for the 10 metre air rifle event after receiving a wild card from the Tripartite Commission. Before the games Choden said that, [...] "Bhutan is just a small country of just 700,000. There {{is a lot of}} pressure on us but we must be realistic about our chances. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to do well." [...] Choden spent time in Germany and Bangladesh preparing for the games. On July 28 Choden competed in the qualification round of her event. She finished 56th out of 56 athletes with a score of 381 points. She scored 18 points less the two equal highest scoring athlete, Sylwia Bogacka of Poland and Yi Siling of China. Choden scored 16 points less than Czech Kateřina Emmons who was the lowest scoring qualifier for the final and therefore her competition ended at the qualifying round. In an interview with Reuters after the games Choden said: [...] "I really enjoyed it. Now we can see how hard we need to work to be really good." ...|$|E
500|$|Like Powderfinger's {{previous}} album Internationalist, Odyssey Number Five {{commented on}} social and political issues heavily, with the primary point of focus being Aboriginal affairs. The lyrics of [...] "Like a Dog" [...] attacked former Prime Minister of Australia John Howard's Liberal government for its treatment of Indigenous Australians, and for breaking the [...] "relaxed and comfortable" [...] promise he made in the Australian federal election, 1996. Lead singer Bernard Fanning related this to the band's other ethical stances—refusing to appear on Hey Hey it's Saturday, for its anti-gay commentary, or not allowing Powderfinger songs {{to be used in}} jingles, amongst others—stating, [...] "We're not here to set an example. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to be happy with ourselves and not end up with a guilty conscience." [...] Fanning said that despite [...] "Like a Dog" [...] being about a political issue, it was not a political song, rather just Powderfinger [...] "voicing our opinions". The band worked with boxer Anthony Mundine on the song's music video, whom Fanning praised as [...] "the perfect lead, {{in terms of what the}} song is about and the fact that he’s prepared to speak up for what he believes in." ...|$|E
500|$|Jericho Cross (voiced by Christopher Corey Smith): The {{protagonist of}} the game, a jaded American Civil War deserter and drifter {{who became a}} gunslinger and train robber. During his [...] "one last job", he {{releases}} Lazarus Malkoth from his prison in a failed attempt to steal the contents. While dueling with Lazarus, Jericho gets bitten and infected by the vampire curse. His already deadly skills are enhanced by his vampire powers that afford him superhuman strength, increased endurance, enhanced agility, and heightened senses, {{in the form of}} the bioluminescent red orb that regenerated from his empty eye socket. Shadow is Jericho's demonic horse that appears at his beckon. According to the developers, they created [...] "deep psychological profiles of every character in the game" [...] with [...] "hope that Jericho's character arc — as this desperate [...] that's robbing trains with a subconscious death wish — makes a believable transition into this half-vampire hybrid gunslinger and will ultimately envelop the player in his destiny: which is a guy that can be either a hero or a terror. Basically, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> people to care about this character and what happens to him — and I can't think of a first-person shooter that's really made us do that yet." ...|$|E
5000|$|Director Aya Kyogoku {{stated that}} the game was {{conceived}} {{as a vehicle for}} the creation of the first Animal Crossing Amiibo: [...] "Honestly, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> Animal Crossing amiibo.

[...] She said that the creators had happily indulged in the chance to [...] "visually draw on everything" [...] that British {{imagination}} can offer. David Arnold said “It's going to be beautiful, cheeky, cheesy, camp, silly and thrilling", and added that [...] "we {{could have done this}} 15 times over, and not had the same show, and it would still have been full of amazing British music". He thought that it should be the [...] "greatest after party" [...] and was “really a celebration of Britishness in terms of [...] the arts". Arnold himself had devoted two years working on the ceremony and had turned down all other work including Skyfall, but said that it was the [...] "most fun" [...] he had [...] "ever had in music". In the handover section Rio aimed to express [...] "multicultural embrace."

500|$|... "When I Grow Up" [...] was debuted live on American {{talk show}} Jimmy Kimmel Live! on May 20, 2008. On May 27, 2008 MTV News {{reported}} that the Pussycat Dolls were among many set to perform at the 2008 MTV Movie Awards on June 1, 2008. Scherzinger talked about the performance saying: [...] "This {{is a big deal}} for us. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to kill it. It's all about the Dolls right now, and we're coming strong." [...] The girls performed wearing spandex-and-leather getups, while a backdrop was displayed in the background with images of flashbulbs, tabloid headlines and diamonds. They were joined by America's Best Dance Crew winners the Jabbawockeez who descended from the ceiling wearing matching red T-shirts with stark-white masks covering their faces, and baseball caps perched at 45-degree angles atop their heads. Of the performance, Geoff Boucher from the Los Angeles Times commented: [...] "the Pussycat Dolls' set climaxed with a powerful pyro display that left celebs in the first few rows feeling a bit roasted". MTV Buzzworthy described the performance as [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "sultry". However, Tod Martens, in another review for the Los Angeles Times, criticized their performance. He commented: [...] " [...] onstage looking like they had escaped a taping for a sexed-up Jazzercise video." [...] He also wrote that Scherzinger never commanded the song except on [...] "the cut's final seconds when she turned her vocals up to a growl" [...] and noted JabbaWockeez's appearance as [...] "annoy".|$|E

5000|$|Stone Sour's {{fourth and}} fifth albums, House of Gold & Bones - Part 1 and Part 2 are notable for their concept album format, and has led to {{comparisons}} to progressive rock bands.

We said we're going to adopt the ideas of those stories and stuff, but it's still going to be a Stone Sour record, where you can still pull those individual songs. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to offer something more - in a world where it's all about singles, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> to do something different.

This logic relates to visual and aural aspects as well as overt intellectualisation, through literary references and driving philosophies. Books such as Don Quixote, House of Leaves, Labyrinths and the philosophies of Jeremy Bentham have all played a role in shaping the themes of Isis' releases.|$|E
