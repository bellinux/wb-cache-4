500|$|Somewhat surprisingly, Clinton {{faced an}} erosion of support from women voters during her campaign, with her numbers declining {{throughout}} 1999. [...] This was partly a typical pattern seen with women candidates where they have an early surge of female support, which then wears off, and it was partly due to her early campaign stumbles. [...] But it also reflected the particular set of mixed feelings that women had towards Clinton's marriage and the ambition and the power she derived from it. [...] The problem was especially acute among some female demographics; one of her longtime advisers later said, [...] "Women in the educated professional class? They fucking couldn't stand her. We could never figure out <b>why.</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> psychologists come in." ...|$|E
500|$|The band began {{recording}} {{without much}} material {{and needed to}} compose songs on the spot, either by jamming or talking through ideas. Morrison enjoyed not having multiple takes, as on The Soft Parade, and showed up to the sessions on time and sober, unlike sessions for that album. The absence of Rothchild helped as he was a perfectionist who insisted on many takes. In 1994, guitarist Robby Krieger stated, [...] "Rothchild was gone, {{which is one reason}} <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> so much fun. The warden was gone." [...] Despite its troubled beginnings, L.A. Woman contains some of the Doors' most critically acclaimed songs, {{as well as some of}} their most blues-oriented. Lyrically, it deals with contemporary topics such as love, life in Los Angeles, and complex aspects of the human experience. Manzarek explained the band did not [...] "approach the album with one vision, but after we started working on the songs, we realized that they're talking about L.A. They're about men, women, boys, girls, love, loss, lovers-lost, and lovers-found in Los Angeles". The album, as a whole, demonstrated Morrison's songwriting abilities, combined with his poetic phrasing and enthusiasm for Los Angeles, and a desire to leave the city with his partner, Pamela Courson. Artistically, L.A. Woman saw the band mixing blues, psychedelia, and jazz, often within a single song. For the first time since [...] "The End" [...] and [...] "When the Music's Over", the group incorporated longer songs, including [...] "L.A. Woman" [...] and [...] "Riders on the Storm".|$|E

[...] "I simply didn't get any support at all for field placings in the early Tests and that is <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> continual disagreements".

2500|$|Clarence Hickman {{was born}} on a farm {{established}} by his grandfather Leak on August 16, 1889. The nearest town was Lizton, Indiana to the south. Clarence and his siblings attended the Leak country school until 1898, when the family moved northward to the Job Hadley farm, where the children attended another country school. In both residences, Clarence pursued an interest in archery, playing with bows and arrows made by his father. By his own account, The arrows had heavy heads so {{that we did not}} need feathers to guide the arrow.... We boys shot fish with bows, using umbrella staves as arrows.
