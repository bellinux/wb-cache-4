On 26 March 2014, he stated on CNN: In an accident investigation, it's a critical part to come up with theories. Especially right now when we don't have anything. We don't have anything tangible. We don't have something to say, hey, yes - because we don't know where that airplane is and <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> why. If you take one theory, the airplane would be where we're looking at right now. If you take another theory, where there was nefarious intent, they're trying to avoid radars, the airplane could be somewhere else. If you say it was - whatever it is, you've got to use these theories, weigh them against the facts so you know which one to go to.|$|E
