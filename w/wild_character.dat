2500|$|In {{addition}} to his ability as a player, Lazetich developed a reputation as [...] "a <b>wild</b> <b>character</b> {{if there ever was}} one." [...] Decades later, Los Angeles Times columnist Frank Finch wrote that, although modern players were bigger and faster, he preferred the characters of the early NFL over the [...] "faceless robots" [...] of the modern game. [...] He focused in particular on Lazetich: [...] "A character's character was Ram middle guard Milan (Sheriff) Lazetich. [...] He was a blithe spirit from Montana who'd played college football at Michigan before joining the Rams in '46 for a five-year stint. [...] That he lasted that long with the club is remarkable in light of what he pulled at Dan Reeves' Christmas party for the team {{at the end of the}} '46 season." [...] Reeves, the Rams' owner, invited the team to a party at his home; the centerpiece was a large cake in the design of a football field topped with a full-size football covered in chocolate. [...] Teammate and Pro Football Hall of Famer Tom Fears later recalled the incident this way:"During the course of predinner libations, someone asked Lazetich to demonstrate his punting prowess. [...] I don't think he'd ever kicked a football before in his life. [...] They dared him to boot the chocolate football, which was a big mistake because Laz wasn't the kind of guy to take a dare lightly. [...] He ambled out to the kitchen, plucked the football off the top of the fancy cake, brought it out in the front room and drove his toe into it with beautiful form and a perfect follow through. [...] Cake, frosting and everything else that was loose was well distributed over the ceiling, walls, windows and drapes. ... It also was the last party Reeves ever held in his house for the Rams." ...|$|E

In the beginning, {{it was a day}} of motorbike tests of all types, some rock music, tons and tons of dust, many <b>wild</b> <b>characters</b> and no cars were allowed. Gradually it changed as men cared more for their motorbikes. There were fewer and fewer bike activities, no dust, hours and hours of rock music, more women and cars were allowed. Most motorbikes became a symbol of elegance rather than horsepower. Among the <b>wild</b> looking <b>characters</b> you could be introduced to doctors, ministers of religion and so on. If you were wandering 'round like a free spirit, a fish out of water, some of the <b>wild</b> <b>characters</b> would invite you into their tent for a cup of coffee. I enjoyed talking to and listening to these men as their speech was always so direct. A few challenges were directed at me but I alway managed to dodge the issue. " [...] Graham S. Burstow...|$|R

At any rate, he was glad to escape to his hill-top, the free air of which had doubtless contributed to keep him in health through so long a course of morbid thought and estranged study as he had addicted himself to.|$|E

These men have, today, shown themselves capable of taking advantage of the <b>wild</b> <b>character</b> of their country; and as to their courage, there can be no question, whatever. If this is a fair sample of the resistance that we have to expect, throughout the whole country, we shall need at least fifty thousand men to subdue them." ...|$|E

5000|$|The film {{follows the}} {{character}} of Arthur (Bale) an English journalist once enraptured by glam rock as a 1970s teenager, who returns a decade later to hunt down his former heroes: Brian Slade (Rhys Meyers), a feather boa-wearing androgyne with an alter ego, [...] "Maxwell Demon", who resembles Bowie in his Ziggy Stardust incarnation, and Curt Wild (McGregor), an Iggy Pop-style rocker. The narrative playfully rewrites glam rock myths which in some cases sail unnervingly close to the truth. Slade flirts with bisexuality and decadence before staging his own death in a live performance and disappearing from the scene, echoing Bowie's own disavowal of glam rock in the late 1970s and his subsequent re-creation as an avowedly heterosexual pop star. The film features a love affair between Slade and <b>Wild's</b> <b>characters,</b> recalling rumors about Bowie and Reed's supposed sexual relationship. Curt <b>Wild's</b> <b>character</b> has a flashback to enforced electric shock treatment as a teenager to attempt to cure his homosexuality, echoing Reed's teenage experiences {{as a victim of}} the homophobic medical profession.|$|R

60|$|Ever since Lucy {{had reached}} her teens {{there had been}} {{predictions}} {{that she would be}} kidnapped, and now the thing had come to pass. She was in danger, she knew, but in infinitely less than had any other <b>wild</b> <b>character</b> of the uplands been her captor. She believed, if she went quietly and obediently with Creech, that she would be, at least, safe from harm. It was hard luck for Bostil, she thought, but no worse than he deserved. Retribution had overtaken him. How terribly hard he would take the loss of his horses! Lucy wondered if he really ever would part with the King, even to save her from privation and peril. Bostil was more likely to trail her with his riders and to kill the Creeches than to concede their demands. Perhaps, though, that threat to sell her to Cordts would frighten the hard old man.|$|E
6000|$|To {{readers of}} a touring habit this Saxon Country is perhaps well known. For {{the last half-century}} it has been growing more and more famous, {{under the name of}} [...] "Saxon Switzerland (SACHSISCHE SCHWEITZ)," [...] instead of [...] "Misnian Highlands (MEISSNISCHE HOCHLAND)," [...] which it used to be called. A {{beautiful}} enough and extremely rugged Country; interesting to the picturesque mind. Begins rising, in soft Hills, {{on both sides of the}} Elbe, a few miles east of Dresden, as you ascend the River; till it rises into Hills of <b>wild</b> <b>character,</b> getting ever wilder, and riven into wondrous chasms and precipices. Extends, say almost twenty miles up the River, to Tetschen and beyond, in this eastern direction; and with perhaps ten miles of breadth on each side of the River: area of the Rock-region, therefore, is perhaps some four hundred square miles. The Falkenberg (what we should call HAWKSCRAG) northeastward in the Lausitz, the Schneeberg (SNOW MOUNTAIN), southeastward on the Bohemian border, are about thirty-five miles apart: these two are both reckoned to be in it,--its last outposts on that eastern side. But the limits of it are fixed by custom only, and depend on no natural condition.|$|E
60|$|Although Ellen was vastly their {{superior}} in that spirit which emanates from moral qualities, she {{was by no}} means the equal of the two eldest daughters of Esther, in the important military property of insensibility to danger. Reared in the hardihood of a migrating life, on the skirts of society, where they had become familiarised to the sights and dangers of the wilderness, these girls promised fairly to become, at some future day, no less distinguished than their mother for daring, and for that singular mixture of good and evil, which, in a wider sphere of action, would probably have enabled the wife of the squatter to enrol her name among the remarkable females of her time. Esther had already, on one occasion, made good the log tenement of Ishmael against an inroad of savages; and on another, she had been left for dead by her enemies, after a defence that, with a more civilised foe, would have entitled her to the honours of a liberal capitulation. These facts, and sundry others of a similar nature, had often been recapitulated with suitable exultation in the presence of her daughters, and the bosoms of the young Amazons were now strangely fluctuating between natural terror and the ambitious wish to do something that might render them worthy of being the children of such a mother. It appeared that the opportunity for distinction, of this <b>wild</b> <b>character,</b> was no longer to be denied them.|$|E

6000|$|For {{it was to}} India {{that the}} minds of the little Baptist Society were turned by the return of one John Thomas, who seems to have been the Gaultier Sans Avoir of this crusade. He was Baptist by education, and having gone out as a surgeon to Calcutta, had been so shocked at the state of things as to begin to preach on his own account, but he was a hot tempered, {{imprudent}} man, and quarrelled with everybody, so as to make the cause still more unpopular with the East Indians. Yet this strange, <b>wild</b> <b>character</b> had a wonderful power of awakening enthusiasm. He had come home in the same ship with one Wilson, whose history was a marvel in itself. He had been made prisoner by the French during the Carnatic war, and finding that the captives were to be delivered up to Hyder Ali, he resolved to escape, leapt forty feet from his prison window, and swam the river Coleroon, in happy ignorance that it was infested with alligators; but then going up an eminence to judge of his bearings, he was seen, secured, and stripped naked, and, with his hands tied behind him, was driven before Hyder Ali. His account of having crossed the Coleroon was treated as a lie. [...] "No mortal man," [...] said the natives, [...] "had ever swum the river; did he but dip a finger in, he would be seized by the alligators," [...] but when evidence proved the fact, the Nabob held up his hands and cried, [...] "This is the man of God." [...] Nevertheless Wilson was chained to a soldier, and, like the well-known David Baird, John Lindsay, and many others, was driven naked, barefoot, and wounded, 500 miles to Seringapatam; where, loaded with irons of thirty-two pounds weight, and chained in couples, they were thrust into a [...] "black hole," [...] and fed so scantily that Wilson declared that at sight of food his jaws snapped together of themselves. Many a time in the morning corpses were unchained, and the survivors coupled up together again. Wilson was one of the thirty-one who lived to be released after twenty-two months, in a frightful state of exhaustion and disease. Afterwards, when commanding a ship at Bencoolen, every European under his command died, and he alone escaped, yet all this time he was an absolute infidel; and, when having made a fortune, he was returning home, he appeared so utterly hardened against all the arguments that the zealous Thomas could bring in favour of Christianity, as to make him in despair remark to the chief officer that he should have more hope of converting the Lascar sailors than of Captain Wilson.|$|E

2500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times, however, {{believing that}} the film was less about its <b>wild</b> <b>characters</b> and more about personification, wrote: [...] "The Bear...is a {{remarkable}} achievement only on its own terms, which happen to be extremely limited and peculiar...its true emphasis is not on wildlife. Instead, it grafts the thoughts and dreams of more commonplace beings onto bear-shaped stand-ins." [...] Writing for the hunting and fishing magazine Field & Stream, editor Cathleen Erring stated that The Bear not only stripped its human characters of [...] "all sympathetic traits and [...] them to the bears", but it also created [...] "a caricature that will subject anyone embarking on a bear hunt ... {{to the kind of}} scorn previously reserved for 'Bambi Butchers'." ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} gapped {{variants of}} classical data compression paradigms (Ziv, J. and Lempel, A., 1977, 1978; Welch, T. A., 1984). In the original algorithm, phrases are identified {{and stored in}} a dictionary on-the-fly as the text-file is scanned. The entries in the dictionary are then matched against the incoming string, thereby determining the next codeword, and this gives the method an inherently linear-time implementation. In our variants, the phrases used in compression are selected among suitably chosen strings of intermittently solid and <b>wild</b> <b>characters</b> produced by the autocorrelation of the source-string, {{in a way that}} still preserves linearity of time. At the receiver, gaps can be filled back exactly, interpolated, or left blank, so that lossless, as well as lossy, implementations are possible. However, the focus of the paper is on lossy variants...|$|R
