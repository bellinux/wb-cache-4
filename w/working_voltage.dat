25|$|Carbon aerogels {{are used}} in the {{construction}} of small electrochemical double layer supercapacitors. Due to the high surface area of the aerogel, these capacitors can be 1/2000th to 1/5000th the size of similarly rated electrolytic capacitors. Aerogel supercapacitors can have a very low impedance compared to normal supercapacitors and can absorb or produce very high peak currents. At present, such capacitors are polarity-sensitive and need to be wired in series to achieve a <b>working</b> <b>voltage</b> of greater than about 2.75V.|$|E
25|$|Capacitors are {{combined}} in series {{to achieve a}} higher <b>working</b> <b>voltage,</b> for example for smoothing a high voltage power supply. The voltage ratings, {{which are based on}} plate separation, add up, if capacitance and leakage currents for each capacitor are identical. In such an application, on occasion, series strings are connected in parallel, forming a matrix. The goal is to maximize the energy storage of the network without overloading any capacitor. For high-energy storage with capacitors in series, some safety considerations must be applied to ensure one capacitor failing and leaking current does not apply too much voltage to the other series capacitors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- A {{new design}} method for high {{performance}} level shifting circuits {{is presented in}} this paper. We propose two level shifting circuits that reduce problems that exist in complementary level shifting circuits described previously. Using HSPICE parameters of a 0. 35 um CMOS process, simulations have been performed under various capacitive loading and operating conditions. The simulation results show that our design method can achieve 16. 6 % low-to-high propagation delay decrease and 27. 2 % low-to-high power delay product improvement when converting 3. 3 V to 5 V compared with conventional level shifting circuits. In addition, as the <b>working</b> <b>voltages</b> being converted are reduced, the design yields still greater advantage without degrading circuit performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} using the double layer {{capacitor}} (DLC) for storing charge between an electrode and electrolyte was first introduced in 1845.

25|$|Small {{capacitors}} {{are used}} in electronic devices to couple signals between stages of amplifiers, as components of electric filters and tuned circuits, or as parts of power supply systems to smooth rectified current. Larger capacitors are used for energy storage in such applications as strobe lights, as parts of some types of electric motors, or for power factor correction in AC power distribution systems. Standard capacitors have a fixed value of capacitance, but adjustable capacitors are frequently used in tuned circuits. Different types are used depending on required capacitance, <b>working</b> <b>voltage,</b> current handling capacity, and other properties.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Highly porous carbon {{prepared}} through sol-gel processing is {{an excellent}} electrode material for supercapacitors, also known as electrochemical capacitors, because of its high surface area and pore volume, good conductivity, and low cost. Research has mostly focused on increasing the surface area of the carbon to improve charge storage, but {{there are limits to}} how large this value can be while still maintaining good electrochemical performance of the material. Alternatively, carbon can be modified with foreign elements, either in the bulk or on the pore surfaces, to induce pseudocapacitive reactions that can increase capacitance. Modified samples can also be tested at higher <b>working</b> <b>voltages,</b> which significantly increase the energy and power densities. In this work, highly porous carbon is modified with nitrogen and tested as electrodes in supercapacitors. Modification significantly increases the wettability of the carbon, and the capacitance increases with increasing nitrogen added. However, too much nitrogen can cause pore blockage and decrease accessible surface area, limiting the capacitance. Highly porous carbon, both with and without nitrogen on the pore surfaces, is then tested at higher <b>working</b> <b>voltages.</b> Increasing the voltage from 2 V to 3 V significantly improves both the energy density and power density. Finally, porous carbon was also synthesized from lignin, a complex polymer derived from natural resources and a waste product in the paper industry. Purification removed over half of the impurities and resulted in porous carbon with four times the internal surface area compared to unpurified lignin. When tested in devices, lignin-derived carbon shows promise as low-cost, renewable material for high performance supercapacitors...|$|R
