40|$|Roof bolter occupations in {{underground}} {{coal mines}} continue to experience overexposure to respirable dust. One {{potential source of}} dust in roof bolting operations is the exhaust from the roof bolter dust collection system. A wet exhaust <b>conditioner</b> (<b>water</b> <b>box)</b> has been developed to reduce dust emissions from the exhaust of the vacuum dust collection system on roof bolting machines. The exhaust conditioner consists of a muffler chamber and a water chamber with four internal partitions to direct airflow {{over the surface of}} the water. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conducted a series of laboratory tests to assess the respirable dust capture ability of this device as compared to the standard exhaust muffler. To determine the dust collection efficiency, both devices were placed in the exhaust stream of a simulated roof bolter dust collection system. Gravimetric samplers were operated upstream and downstream of the exhaust conditioner and muffler to evaluate the ability to capture both respirable coal and limestone dust. Researchers observed a 41 percent reduction in dust concentrations for the <b>water</b> exhaust <b>conditioner</b> in the laboratory configuration. Significant levels of dust deposition in the sampling chambers may have contributed to this effective capture rate...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study {{to investigate the}} effect of using the magnetic <b>water</b> <b>conditioner</b> on the properties of water. The water flows through a closed loop, while the pH, TDS, and hardness represent its properties. For magnetic <b>water</b> <b>conditioner</b> with flux density of 170 mT, results showed that pH increased by 15. 65 % for 820 minutes of non-stop circulation. The increase in pH is divided to 93. 5 % for the first 360 minutes, and 6. 5 % for the last 460 minutes. TDS and Hardness of water are not affected by the magnetic <b>water</b> <b>conditioner.</b> <b>Water</b> remembers and keeps the impact of passing through the magnetic field for several hours, and pH decreased by 0. 642 in 24 hours.

50|$|A typical {{household}} freshwater aquarium set-up, {{apart from}} its aquatic tenants, consists of furnishings such as a gravel substrate, live or plastic plants, rocks, driftwood, a backcloth or background, and other decorations.

30|$|The MUT {{imaging system}} {{can be divided into}} two parts: the <b>water</b> <b>conditioner</b> (Onda Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and the {{scanning}} system. The <b>water</b> <b>conditioner</b> continuously degasifies, de-ionises, heats (kept at 25 – 30  °C), filters, and ultraviolet (UV)-light irradiates water in the pause between patients to keep the physical attributes of the water constant. This is achieved with a pump (SE-PSH 000 HM 1000, SEKO Spa, Italy) with a flow rate of 2  l/min, which pumps the water from the tank through a 5 -μm and 10 -μm filter in tandem (Pentek, Milwaukee, WI, USA) as well as a mixed-bed de-ionisation resin filter (Pentek, Sheboygan, WI, USA). For sanitisation purposes, the water passes an UV-C lamp (Puro-Tap, Puro-Parma, Italy). The other cycle transports the water from the tank into the scanning chamber using another pump (SE-PSH 000 HM 1000, SEKO Spa, Italy) with a maximum flow rate of 2  l/min and once more passes an identical UV-C lamp.|$|R

40|$|The {{intensification}} of aquaculture in the Philippines {{has made the}} use of chemicals and biological products inevitable. A recent survey conducted nation wide among shrimp and milkfish culture facilities revealed the use of more than 100 products for rearing, prophylaxis, and treatment purposes.

All of these are readily available in the market. The dosages, purposes, patterns of use, origins, and manufacturers of these chemicals and biological products are discussed in this paper. The indiscriminate use of chemicals has caused mortalities and morphological deformities in the host and development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. The use of chemicals in aquaculture also poses dangers to public health. Government policies regulating or prohibiting the use ofcertain chemicals for aquaculture have helped curtail the destructive consequences of chemotherapy. Moreover, research institutions have geared their studies towards discovering environmentally safe drugs and other alternatives to disease control. However, these efforts will be futile unless a strong and aggressive campaign on the cautious and restricted use of drugs in aquaculture is conducted among shrimp and fish farmers, drug manufacturers and suppliers...|$|R
