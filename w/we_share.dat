5|$|Until the Taung childthe 2.8 million-year-old {{remains of}} an Australopithecus africanuswere {{discovered}} in South Africa in 1924, Dubois's and Koenigswald's discoveries were the oldest hominid remains ever found. Some scientists {{of the day}} suggested that Dubois's Java Man was a potential intermediate form between modern humans and the common ancestor <b>we</b> <b>share</b> with the other great apes. This supposition has been confirmed, but the current consensus of anthropologists is that the direct ancestors of modern humans were African populations of Homo erectus (possibly Homo ergaster), rather than the Asian populations {{of the same species}} exemplified by Java Man and Peking Man.|$|E

25|$|One student {{did find}} some remains: a Dutchman named Eugène Dubois searched the East Indies from 1887 to 1895, {{discovering}} {{the remains of}} Java Man in 1891, consisting of a skullcap, thighbone, and a few teeth. These remains are among the oldest hominid remains ever found. Dubois classified Java Man with Haeckel's Pithecanthropus label, though they were later reclassified as Homo erectus. Some scientists of the day suggested Dubois' Java Man as a potential intermediate form between modern humans and the common ancestor <b>we</b> <b>share</b> with the other great apes. The current consensus of anthropologists is that the direct ancestors of modern humans were African populations of Homo erectus (possibly Homo ergaster), rather than the Asian populations exemplified by Java Man and Peking Man. (Ironically, a new human species, Homo floresiensis, a dwarf human type, has recently been discovered in the island of Flores).|$|E

25|$|Hauerwas {{finds the}} {{language}} of “rights” to be disturbing as it assumes that people relate to others as strangers, and lends even {{the understanding of the}} family to that of a contractual society. He argues that being part of a family, however, is not a voluntary undertaking. As such, when one is part of a family, the kinds of responsibilities each member holds are in relation to each other. Hauerwas finds that as a parent, you have a duty to your children, not just because you brought them into existence, but because the role of parent is to ensure the children are brought up {{in a way that is}} conducive to the community’s values. Thus, the issue with “rights” language is that it attempts to prevent maltreatment of individuals to the point of exclusion of familial and communal responsibility. Hauerwas’s bottom line is that there can be no real society if its members only relate in terms of noninterference. The language of rights destroys society because we regard people as strangers instead of assuming the responsibility towards them as family and members of the community that <b>we</b> <b>share.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{idea of this}} monumental {{inscription}} {{comes from}} Roman classical architecture. The Romans brought Christianity to these islands, along with the custom of engraving stone.

The monumental inscription is a familiar feature of Roman architecture. The inscription over {{the entrance of the}} Wales Millennium Centre is a revival of this classical tradition, and also a recognition of the formative influence of Roman culture upon our nation. We're lucky to have two languages; one that <b>we</b> <b>share</b> with half the world and one which belongs just to us. Words in songs, stories and poems have helped to make Wales the proud country that it is. —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E
