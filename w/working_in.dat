40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to determine the psychological effect of working mothers upon children living in joint and nuclear family structures of Pakistan. After detailed literature review it was hypothesized that (1) Children of <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure will have more psychological problems as compared to the children of <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure. (2) There will be more positive correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure than the correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure. (3) Children of <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure will have less psychological problems as compared to the children of non-working mothers in joint family structure. (4) There will be more positive correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure than the correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of non- <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure. (5) Children of <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure will have less psychological problems as compared to the children of non-working mothers in nuclear family structure. (6) There will be more positive correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure as compared to the correlation between Intellectual capacity and level of Academic Achievement of children of non- <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure. On hypothesis 1, 3 and 5 the difference will be evident on the variables of Antisocial Behavior, Anger Control Problems, Emotional Distress, Positive Self and Adjustment Sample of the present research consisted of 256 Adolescent children of the working and non working mothers, including 64 children of working mothers of joint family structure (32 male, 32 female), 64 children of non working mothers of joint family structure (32 male, 32 female), 64 children of working mothers belonging to nuclear family structure (32 male, 32 female), and 64 children of non working mothers belonging to nuclear family structure (32 male, 32 female). Their age range was from 12 years to 18 years. Subjects were interviewed & then SPM, WRAT-R & RASSI were administered according to standard procedure test was calculated {{in order to determine the}} difference of Antisocial Behavior, Anger Control Problem, Emotional Distress, Positive Self and Adjustment between the Adolescent children of working mothers of joint family structure and nuclear family structure, Adolescent children of working and non <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure and Adolescent children of working and non <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure. Pearson Product Moment Coefficient Correlation was applied to analyze the relationship between the intellectual capacity and academic achievement of Adolescent children of working mothers of joint family structure and nuclear family structure, Adolescent children of working and non <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure and Adolescent children of working and non <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure. Further z-test was calculated to determine the significant difference between correlations of above mentioned groups. The results showed significant differences between adolescent children of employed mothers of two family structures (Joint and nuclear) on the variables of Antisocial behavior, Anger control problems, Emotional distress, Positive self and Adjustment. There was a significant difference on the variables of Emotional distress, Positive self and Adjustment and insignificant differences on other two variables i. e. of Antisocial behavior and Anger control problems, between adolescents children of working and Non-working mothers in joint family structures. There was also significant differences on the variables of Antisocial behavior, Anger control problems and Adjustment and insignificant differences on the variables of, Emotional distress and Positive self between adolescent children of working and Non- <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structures. Further the correlation of intellectual capacity and academic achievement was more positive (i) for children of <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure as compared to children of <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure. (ii) for children of <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure as compared to children of non <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> joint family structure and (iii) for children of <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure as compared to children of non <b>working</b> mothers <b>in</b> nuclear family structure.

In this study, the effect of change in management efficiency <b>in</b> <b>working</b> capital management <b>in</b> to the change <b>in</b> <b>working</b> capital is compared by company size and sectors.

5|$|Public {{condemnation}} {{of the use of}} breaker boys was so widespread that in 1885 Pennsylvania enacted a law forbidding the employment of anyone under the age of 12 from <b>working</b> <b>in</b> a coal breaker, but the law was poorly enforced; many employers forged proof-of-age documentation, and many families forged birth certificates or other documents so their children could support the family. Estimates of the number of breaker boys at work in the anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania vary widely, and official statistics are generally considered by historians to undercount the numbers significantly. One estimate had 20,000 breaker boys <b>working</b> <b>in</b> the state in 1880, 18,000 <b>working</b> <b>in</b> 1900, 13,133 <b>working</b> <b>in</b> 1902, and 24,000 <b>working</b> <b>in</b> 1907. Technological innovations in the 1890s and 1900s (such as mechanical and water separators designed to remove impurities from coal) dramatically lowered the need for breaker boys, but adoption of the new technology was slow.|$|E
