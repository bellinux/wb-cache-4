2500|$|Despite {{the doubts}} about Lanier's {{portrayal}} as Chrissy, Silverman put {{the show on}} the network lineup, to air in March 1977, yet ordered {{a search for a}} new Chrissy. In an interview with The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Foundation, Silverman said that Suzanne Somers barely made it {{as a member of the}} cast. [...] "I was very involved in the casting of Suzanne Somers. We did three pilots", he recalls, [...] "and the Chrissy character still wasn't right. We got to the day before we're starting the production of the series and we didn't have a Chrissy. I was so desperate, I took all the audition tapes and just kind of fast forwarded them. All of a sudden, they went by Suzanne Somers who I hadn't seen, but I recognized her from her appearance on The Tonight Show, I said 'back that up' and she was great. She's been passed on! And I said 'I don't understand. This girl could play that part, <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> been passed on?' and I couldn't get a straight answer. Anyway, we got her in that day and she was on the set tomorrow and she was terrific in that part. And that was an accident because she never should have gotten the part.". With Somers set in the role the third pilot hastily went into production in January 1977. NRW had initially thought about recasting Ritter at the last minute before the pilot taped. Although liked by test audiences, the producers felt Ritter's foolish and clumsy portrayal of Jack made his character seem somewhat effeminate; Barry Van Dyke, and future television director Michael Lembeck, who had originally auditioned for the now renamed Jack Tripper, were initially considered to take the role. Nonetheless Silverman championed for Ritter to stay on the show. The third pilot was accepted by ABC, and [...] was followed by five additional episodes for the show's spring tryout.|$|E

60|$|Hilary {{approached}} her. For all her mocking {{of her own}} charms, this wife of his {{was strangely}} graceful. After nineteen years in which to learn every line of her face and body, every secret of her nature, she still eluded him; that elusiveness, which had begun by being such a charm, had got on his nerves, and extinguished the flame it had once lighted. He had so often tried to see, and never seen, the essence of her soul. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> made like this? <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> for ever mocking herself, himself, and every other thing? <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> so hard to her own life, so bitter a foe to her own happiness? Leonardo da Vinci might have painted her, less sensual and cruel than his women, more restless and disharmonic, but physically, spiritually enticing, and, by her refusals to surrender either to her spirit or her senses, baffling her own enticements.|$|E

6000|$|... "But <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> so not an angel, then? Clever and lovely--it's {{a rather}} unusual combination, you know. And yet"--she reflectively smiled at me, all candour and gentleness--"well not unique." ...|$|R
6000|$|A little wind wafted the sea {{grass and}} passed over her face. Where was the supreme {{fulfilment}} {{she would never}} enjoy? <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> so cold, so unroused, so indifferent? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> {{left alone}} {{now in her}} old age?" [...] I persisted. [...] "Why don't her {{own flesh and blood}} look after her? Why does she live alone? Don't they ever go to see her or care for her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> the all, the everything, {{why must}} he live only through her, why must he sink {{if he were}} {{detached}} from her? Why must he cleave {{to her in a}} frenzy as for his very life? ...|$|E
6000|$|But Thyme did {{not come}} back. He called to her, and in the death-like silence {{following}} his shouts he could hear his own heart beat. He passed in through the gate. She {{was nowhere to be}} seen. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> playing him this trick? ...|$|E
60|$|Somehow as {{they sat}} {{together}} {{on the deck of}} the great steamer in the afterglow of the sunken sun, listening to the throbbing of the propeller (a rare sound which neither of them of course had ever heard before), de Vere felt that he must speak to her. Something of the mystery of the girl fascinated him. What was she doing here alone with no one but her mother and her maid, on the bosom of the Atlantic? <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> here? <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> not somewhere else? The thing puzzled, perplexed him. It would not let him alone. It fastened upon his brain. Somehow he felt that if he tried to drive it away, it might nip him in the ankle.|$|E
6000|$|I could but helplessly {{think of}} her. [...] "I'm afraid indeed that, with what you've done with her, I can't {{take care of}} her. But <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> now to the purpose," [...] I articulately wondered, [...] "any more than she was?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never! We must {{prevent that}} at all costs. I had rather see him dead before me, than the husband of such a woman. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> {{permitted}} to visit homes like mine? I should have been told this sooner," [...] exclaimed my lady angrily.|$|R

60|$|Albinia {{could not}} help {{shedding}} a few bitter tears. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to be always misjudged, even when she meant the best? And, oh! how hard, well-nigh impossible, to forgive and candidly to believe that, in the old lady, at least, it was partiality, and not spite.|$|E
6000|$|She did not turn, But passed foot-faint with averted head In {{her gown}} of green, by the bobbing fern, Though I {{leaned over the}} gate that led From where we waited with table spread; [...] But she did not turn: <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> near there if love had fled? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "None {{questions}} thy {{right to}} that," [...] said Asad. [...] "But being resolved {{to take her}} with thee, why not take her openly? <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> not housed in the poop-house, as becomes the wife of Sakr-el-Bahr? Why smuggle her aboard in a pannier, and keep her there in secret?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But she did {{not care}} for the Adam and Eve, and he never put another stroke to it. She jeered at the Eve, saying, [...] "She is like a little marionette. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> so small? You've made Adam as big as God, and Eve like a doll." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Generally," [...] replied Captain Wragge--"I guessed, generally, {{that you}} {{proposed}} dipping your {{hand into his}} purse and taking from it (most properly) what was your own.

60|$|In another {{second he}} was gone, more piqued and {{interested}} about this fair unknown {{than he had}} been about any woman for years.

6000|$|... "To--om, To--o--om!" [...] {{rang out}} the strong, inhuman cry. Fred Brangwen's blood froze, {{his heart was}} very angry.

He could not bear the sight of her, perched on a chair in her white {{nightdress}} in the doorway, elvish and horrible.|$|E
6000|$|She {{paused at}} her gate {{with a sudden}} vague feeling of alarm.

6000|$|... "Thank you so much," [...] said Joan gratefully. [...] "And <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> a weak creature?

6000|$|... "My dear sir," [...] cried I, {{encouraged}} by this performance, [...] "for Heaven's sake {{tell me what}} all this means?
