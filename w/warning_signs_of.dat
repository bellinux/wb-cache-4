She also took part in a sponsored walk from Dublin to Navan for the See the Light campaign, which seeks {{to raise awareness of}} mental health issues. However, she told the Irish Independent that she does not want the focus to be on her father's death every time she attends a suicide prevention event.|$|E

25|$|MacDonald (1963) {{observed}} {{in his most}} sadistic patients a triad of childhood cruelty to animals, firesetting and enuresis or frequent bed-wetting. Such maladaptive childhood behaviors often result from poorly developed coping mechanisms. This triad, although not intended to predict criminal behavior, provides the <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> a child under considerable stress. Children under substantial stress, particularly in their home environment, frequently engage in maladaptive behaviors, such as these, in order to alleviate the stress produced by their surroundings.|$|E
25|$|A tsunami {{cannot be}} {{precisely}} predicted, {{even if the}} magnitude and location of an earthquake is known. Geologists, oceanographers, and seismologists analyse each earthquake and based on many factors {{may or may not}} issue a tsunami warning. However, there are some <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> an impending tsunami, and automated systems can provide warnings immediately after an earthquake in time to save lives. One of the most successful systems uses bottom pressure sensors, attached to buoys, which constantly monitor the pressure of the overlying water column.|$|E

25|$|As taste senses both harmful and {{beneficial}} things, all basic tastes {{are classified as}} either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things they sense have on our bodies.

50|$|The sign is {{commonly}} referred to as a radioactivity <b>warning</b> <b>sign,</b> but it is actually a <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation is a much broader category than radioactivity alone, as many non-radioactive sources also emit potentially dangerous levels of ionizing radiation. This includes x-ray apparatus, medical beam cannons and particle accelerators. Non-ionizing radiation can also reach potentially dangerous levels, but this <b>warning</b> <b>sign</b> is different from the trefoil ionizing radiation warning symbol.|$|R
25|$|The {{current system}} of {{confidential}} enquiries began in 1952, however, the history of smaller, local enquiries dates back to 1917 in Aberdeen, with national enquiries across England, Scotland and Wales following in the 1920s and 1930s. Maternal deaths during this period were particularly prevalent in poor, working-class families, thus {{a large part of}} these early local enquiries was focused on the social backgrounds of the women who died. Further emphasis was placed on educating women and their families on the importance of maternity care as well as an understanding of the <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> complications and the importance of seeking help.|$|E
25|$|For over {{a hundred}} years, {{biologists}} have been keeping track of populations of different species with population models. Most models are continuous, but recently scientists {{have been able to}} implement chaotic models in certain populations. For example, a study on models of Canadian lynx showed there was chaotic behavior in the population growth. Chaos can also be found in ecological systems, such as hydrology. While a chaotic model for hydrology has its shortcomings, there is still much to learn from looking at the data through the lens of chaos theory. Another biological application is found in cardiotocography. Fetal surveillance is a delicate balance of obtaining accurate information while being as noninvasive as possible. Better models of <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> fetal hypoxia can be obtained through chaotic modeling.|$|E

The report criticized Virginia Tech educators, administrators {{and mental health}} staff in failing to [...] "connect the dots" [...] from numerous incidents that were <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> Cho's mental instability beginning in his junior year. The report concluded that the school's mental health systems [...] "failed for lack of resources, incorrect interpretation of privacy laws, and passivity." [...] The report called Virginia's mental health laws [...] "flawed" [...] and its mental health services [...] "inadequate". The report also confirmed that Cho was able to purchase two guns in violation of federal law because of Virginia's inadequate background check requirements.|$|E
500|$|In the 1996 novel The Story of B, {{environmentalist}} author Daniel Quinn {{spends a}} chapter on {{the metaphor of the}} boiling frog, using it to describe human history, population growth and food surplus. [...] Pierce Brosnan's character Harry Dalton mentioned it in the 1997 disaster movie Dante's Peak in reference to the accumulating <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> the volcano's reawakening. Al Gore used a version of the story in a New York Times op ed, in his presentations and the 2006 movie An Inconvenient Truth to describe ignorance about global warming. In the movie version the frog is rescued before it is harmed. This use of the story was referenced ironically by writer/director Jon Cooksey in the title of his 2010 comedic documentary How to Boil a Frog.|$|E

Women's expectations of future employment changed. Women began to see themselves going on to college and working through their marriages and even attending graduate school. Many however still had brief and intermittent work force participation, without necessarily having expectations for a [...] "career". To illustrate, most women were secondary earners, and worked in [...] "pink-collar jobs" [...] as secretaries, teachers, nurses, and librarians. Although more women attended college, it was often expected that they attended to find a spouse—the so-called [...] "M.R.S. degree". Nevertheless, Labor force participation by women still grew significantly.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of myths about suicide. [...] It is not usually unpredictable; in 75-80% of cases, the suicidal person has given some sort of warning sign.

[...] If someone is expressing suicidal thoughts, he/she should be encouraged to seek mental health treatment. [...] Friends and family can provide supportive listening, empathy, and encouragement to develop a safety plan. [...] Serious <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> imminent suicidal risk include [...] the intent to commit suicide and a specific plan with access to lethal means. [...] If a person expresses these warning signs, emergency services should be contacted immediately.|$|E

Havins addressed deeper issues about the coupling:I know. I asked if we could do a PSA (Public service announcement) for women in abusive relationships to get help, but that didn't happen. I was concerned about how viewers might be influenced by Babe saying, 'Oh, it's OK, JR, you only tried to kill me because you were drinking.'

2500|$|Chlorine is a {{relatively}} common gas in industry {{with a variety of}} uses. It is used to disinfect water as well as being a part of the sanitation process for sewage and industrial waste. Chlorine is also used as a bleaching agent during the production of paper and cloth. Many household cleaning products, including bleach, contain chlorine. Given the volume and ease of chlorine for industrial and commercial use, exposure could occur from an accidental spill or a deliberate attack. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends that a person wear splash proof goggles, a face shield and a respirator mask when working in the vicinity of chlorine gas. Because chlorine is a gas at room temperature, most exposure occurs via inhalation. Exposure may also occur through skin or eye contact or by ingesting chlorine-contaminated food or water. Chlorine is a strong oxidizing element causing the hydrogen to split from water in moist tissue, resulting in nascent oxygen and hydrogen chloride that cause corrosive tissue damage. Additionally oxidation of chlorine may form hypochlorous acid, which can penetrate cells and react with cytoplasmic proteins destroying cell structure. Chlorine’s odor provides early <b>warning</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> exposure but causes olfactory fatigue or adaptations, reducing awareness of exposure at low concentrations. With increased exposure, symptoms may progress to labored respirations, severe coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, dyspnea, and broncospasm associated with a decrease in oxygen saturation level[...] Severe exposure may result in [...] changes in upper and lower airways resulting in an acute lung injury, which may not be present until several hours after exposure. A recent chlorine gas leak in Pune, India, landed 20 individuals in the hospital. Though that was an accidental exposure, chlorine gas {{has been used as a}} weapon of warfare since World War I, most recently in 2007 in Iraq.|$|E
