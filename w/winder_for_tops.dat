Its function is designed so that it with ease can be handled by any one after only a couple of instructions. You simply thread the cable trough the opening on the winder and then you rotate the upper part until the cable reaches the desired length. After use the winder can be opened to enable easy extraction of the cable...|$|R

50|$|Heralded as a <b>top</b> {{prospect}} <b>for</b> {{the coming}} season, Wool Winder was unplaced to the colt Succor {{in his first}} outing at the Newmarket March Stakes. Baird attributed the loss to the high 140 lb weight Wool Winder carried in the running, 7 lb more than Succor. Approached by representatives of the Hungarian government stud in March, Baird refused to sell Wool <b>Winder</b> <b>for</b> £32,000. Wool <b>Winder's</b> form suffered late in the season, and his training was stopped {{for most of the}} season in the hopes his health and condition would improve for the Ascot Gold Cup. He was ultimately withdrawn from all of his engagements for the entire racing season due to health and soundness issues, his unsuccessful run in the March Stakes his only outing for the year. In November, Baird offered to sell Wool Winder to the Hungarian government for £25,000, but the offer was refused.|$|R

50|$|The rolls have to {{be changed}} when the maximum roll {{diameter}} is reached this can be achieved either manually or automatically. The unit consists of a regulating circuit, which detects the web speed and speed of the carriage. The regulator sets the web speed and speed of the carriage by comparing the web tension with an adjustable web tension set point.Modern automated winders are capable of reasonable high speed roll set change and core introduction, Tissue winders making toilet roll can change over at running speed,Paper and board winders need to stop the winding process to cut the sheet and glue the paper on to a new wind up core,Top line winders introduce the paper core through a maintenance pit down stairs, with web interruption time as low as 15 seconds, More traditional, winders actual web stopped set turn out change time can be as low as 45 seconds,these modern change efficiency upgrades, {{make it possible for}} mills to maintain production over one <b>winder</b> <b>for</b> each paper machine and still carry out maintenance with out risk to product quality.|$|R
