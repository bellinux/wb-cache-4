5000|$|Because Fawful was {{not based}} on any {{existing}} characters in the Mario series, the Nintendo Treehouse, {{which is responsible for}} localizing games for North American audiences, had more creative freedom in writing for the character. Bill Trinen and Nate Bihldorff, both employees of the Treehouse, wrote the English dialogue for Fawful through the exchange of notes. Rather than sticking close to the original Japanese script, where Fawful simply adds [...] "Fururururu!" [...] to the end of every line, Trinen and Bihldorff intended to make Fawful as [...] "wacky" [...] and [...] "crazy" [...] as possible in the Western release. Thus, in English versions of the games, all of Fawful's dialogue consists of broken English and <b>word</b> <b>salads,</b> like [...] "Have you readiness for this?", and his catchphrase, [...] "I have fury!". In Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story, Fawful is voiced by Nami Funashima.|$|R
500|$|Reaction to {{the work}} was mixed, {{including}} negative comment from early supporters of Joyce's work, such as Pound and the author's brother, Stanislaus Joyce. To counteract this hostile reception, a book of essays by supporters of the new work, including Beckett, William Carlos Williams and others was organised and published in 1929 under the title Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress. At his 57th birthday party at the Jolases' home, Joyce revealed the final title {{of the work and}} Finnegans Wake was published in book form on 4 May 1939. Later, further negative comments surfaced from doctor and author Hervey Cleckley, who questioned the significance others had placed on the work. In his book, The Mask of Sanity, Cleckley refers to Finnegans Wake as [...] "a 628-page collection of erudite gibberish indistinguishable to most people from the familiar <b>word</b> <b>salad</b> produced by hebephrenic patients on the back wards of any state hospital." ...|$|E

2500|$|Poor speech {{habits and}} other {{problems}} such as heavy foreign accents and mumbling complicate the process for both the MT and the recognition software. An MT can [...] "flag" [...] such a report as unintelligible, but the recognition software will transcribe the unintelligible word(s) from the existing database of [...] "learned" [...] language. The result is often a [...] "word salad" [...] or missing text. Thresholds can be set to reject a bad report and return it for standard dictation, but these settings are arbitrary. Below a set percentage rate, the <b>word</b> <b>salad</b> passes for actual dictation. The MT simultaneously listens, reads and [...] "edits" [...] the correct version. Every word must be confirmed in this process. The downside of the technology is when the time spent in this process cancels out the benefits. The quality of recognition can range from excellent to poor, with whole words and sentences missing from the report. Not infrequently, negative contractions and the word [...] "not" [...] is dropped altogether. These flaws trigger concerns that the present technology could have adverse effects on patient care. Control over quality can also be reduced when providers choose a server-based program from a vendor Application Service Provider (ASP).|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study {{examined}} the effect of dialect variation on children’s spelling by using devoicing of final /d / in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) as a test case. In line with the linguistic interference hypothesis, African American 6 -year-olds were significantly poorer at spelling the final d of <b>words</b> such as <b>salad</b> than non-African American students after their spelling performance on {{other parts of the}} words was statistically taken into account. Specifically, African American students were more likely than non-African American students to produce spelling errors such as salat for salad. Such misspellings were particularly common in African American children who showed higher rates of devoicing when pro-nouncing the words. African American students did not have more difficulty than non-African American students in spelling the final t of words such as planet. The results suggest that the spellings of some words are particularly opaque for speakers of AAVE and that instruction should take account of this opacity...|$|R

50|$|<b>Word</b> <b>salad</b> may {{describe}} {{a symptom of}} neurological or psychiatric conditions {{in which a person}} attempts to communicate an idea, but words and phrases that may appear to be random and unrelated come out in an incoherent sequence instead. Often, the person is unaware that he or she did not make sense. It appears in people with dementia and schizophrenia, as well as after anoxic brain injury. Clang associations are especially characteristic of mania, as seen in bipolar disorder, as a somewhat more severe variation of flight of ideas. In extreme mania, the patient's speech may become incoherent, with associations markedly loosened, thus presenting as a veritable <b>word</b> <b>salad.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} thought {{disorder}} {{has been criticized}} as being based on circular or incoherent definitions. For example, thought disorder is inferred from disordered speech, {{based on the assumption}} that disordered speech arises because of disordered thought.

In 1978, the band secured a record deal with United Artists, alongside the Buzzcocks, The Stranglers and Dr. Feelgood.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Word</b> <b>salad</b> can be {{generated}} by a computer program for entertainment purposes by inserting randomly chosen words of the same type (nouns, adjectives, etc.) into template sentences with missing words, a game similar to Mad Libs. The video game company Maxis, in their seminal SimCity 2000, used this technique to create an in-game [...] "newspaper" [...] for entertainment; the columns were composed by taking a vague story-structure, and using randomization, inserted various nouns, adjectives, and verbs to generate seemingly unique stories.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Word</b> <b>salad</b> is a [...] "confused or unintelligible {{mixture of}} {{seemingly}} random words and phrases", {{most often used}} to describe {{a symptom of a}} neurological or mental disorder.

The term is often used in psychiatry as well as in theoretical linguistics to describe a type of grammatical acceptability judgment by native speakers, and in computer programming to describe textual randomization.|$|E

5000|$|Lucky is {{most famous}} for his speech in Act I. The {{monologue}} is prompted by Pozzo when the tramps ask him to make Lucky [...] "think". He asks them to give him his hat: when Lucky wears his hat, {{he is capable of}} thinking. The monologue is long, rambling <b>word</b> <b>salad,</b> and does not have any apparent end; it is only stopped when Vladimir takes the hat back. Within the gibberish Lucky makes comments on the arbitrary nature of God, man's tendency to pine and fade away, and towards the end, the decaying state of the earth. His ramblings may be loosely based around the theories of the Irish philosopher Bishop Berkeley.|$|E
5000|$|Circumstantial {{speech is}} more direct than {{tangential}} {{speech in which}} the speaker wanders and drifts (in order to add more thought vectors in unrelated hyperplanes) and usually never returns to the original topic, and is far less severe than logorrhea. A helpful metaphor is traveling to a destination. If someone is thinking and speaking linearly, then they will {{go directly to the}} point. Circumstantial speech is more like taking [...] "unnecessary" [...] detours, according to some, but the speaker eventually arrives at the intended destination. In tangential speech, the speaker simply gets lost along the way, never returning to the original topic of conversation. With logorrhea, which is closer to <b>word</b> <b>salad,</b> it may not even be clear that the speaker had a particular idea or point in the first place.|$|E
50|$|Basaglia {{recognized}} {{that many of}} the characteristics of his patients which were believed to be inherent in their mental illness, such as the <b>word</b> <b>salad,</b> the vacant stares, the repetitive gestures and movements, appeared to dissolve as the patients left the confines of the asylum. Basaglia concluded from this that we would not know what mental illnesses were, or what limitations they would inherently put on persons suffering from them, until both staff and patients were freed from the beliefs, attitudes and culture of the asylum. Basaglia was concerned that, without the complete closing of asylums, mental health professionals would unknowingly reconstitute the asylum culture in community facilities. As long as confinement remained possible, professionals would continue to regard themselves as the ultimately responsible parties, and patients would continue to regard their agency and freedom as dependent on the doctor’s will.|$|E
50|$|Their first album, <b>Word</b> <b>Salad,</b> was {{released}} in 1979 and was a cult success in the UK (John Peel supported the single Remember Russia), but an even bigger critical success and commercial start across continental Europe. There were substantial appearances on The Old Grey Whistle Test and a first Top of the Pops with The Worker single. The second album, entitled Going Deaf for a Living (1980), reinforced Watts' trademark insightful and humorous {{view of the world}} set against strong melodies. It included the track, So Long, his first chart hit single across Europe and in Australia. The band toured extensively throughout Europe and also made their first trip to America. European success was growing fast and the demand for a new album brought Watts back with the powerfully atmospheric Red Skies Over Paradise (1981). A performance at Pinkpop Festival that summer followed and also a performance on the bill with Bob Marley on his final European festival tour.|$|E

Convening with Diane and Humboldt at a table near the kitchen, Steve pleads with his estranged wife for an explanation. Much to Steve's consternation, she refuses to go into details and regards him {{with a mixture of}} apprehension and contempt. The maître d' then makes a surprise reappearance, homicidally insane, screaming [...] "Eeeee!", ranting in <b>word</b> <b>salad,</b> and brandishing a chef's knife. Going berserk, Guy brutally kills Humboldt. Steve briefly fends off the lunatic with his umbrella, then drags the helplessly terrified Diane into the kitchen. Guy gives chase and leaves the cafe's cook with a grisly injury. Desperately struggling to hold off the lunatic, Steve implores Diane to unbolt the rear entrance door so they can both escape, but she remains in a state of gaping shock. Steve is able to incapacitate Guy by dousing him with scalding water, and hitting him with a metal frying pan.|$|E
5000|$|Salzburg, Hallstatt, and Hallein {{lie within}} 17 km {{of each other}} on the river Salzach in central Austria in an area with {{extensive}} salt deposits. Salzach literally means [...] "salt river" [...] and Salzburg [...] "salt castle", both taking their names from the German word [...] meaning salt and Hallstatt was the site of the world's first salt mine. The town gave its name to the Hallstatt culture that began mining for salt in the area in about 800 BC. Around 400 BC, the townsfolk, who had previously used pickaxes and shovels, began open pan salt making. During the first millennium BC, Celtic communities grew rich trading salt and salted meat to Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome in exchange for wine and other luxuries.The word salary comes from the Latin word for salt. The reason for this is unknown; a persistent modern claim that the Roman Legions were sometimes paid in salt is baseless.The <b>word</b> <b>salad</b> literally means [...] "salted", and comes from the ancient Roman practice of salting leaf vegetables.|$|E
5000|$|Schizophrenia is {{a severe}} mental illness that is {{characterized}} by a range of behaviors including hallucinations and delusions. Hallucinations refer to disorders involving the sensory systems, and are most often manifested as seeing or hearing things (e.g., voices) that do not exist. Delusions include odd or unusual beliefs such as grandiosity or paranoia. Both hallucinations and delusions are inconsistent with reality. Other symptoms of schizophrenia include bizarre behavior, odd posture or movements, facial grimacing, loss of, or indifference to self-help skills (grooming, washing, toileting, feeding, etc.). Schizophrenia may also be marked by a host of social and communication deficits, such as social withdrawal, odd use of language, including excessive use of made up words (neologisms), incomprehensible combinations of words (<b>word</b> <b>salad)</b> or overall poverty of speech. There are several subtypes of schizophrenia, but generally speaking the symptoms are often classified into two broad categories: positive and negative symptoms. Positive symptoms refer to those behaviors or condition that are present in schizophrenia but that are not present under typical conditions (hallucinations, delusions). Negative symptoms refer to those behaviors that are conspicuous because of their absence (grooming, language, communication). Several measures or rating scales have been developed to assess the positive and negative aspects of schizophrenia.|$|E
