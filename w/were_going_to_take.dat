The band then played the main stage at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in the summer, along with bands such as Blink-182, Guns N' Roses, Arcade Fire, Paramore, Weezer, Green Day, Lostprophets & Young Guns. This was the band's last {{performances}} on the Billy Talent III Tour, and it was announced by Kowalewicz that the band <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a break before beginning work on their next album.|$|E

25|$|These small {{detachments}} received {{logistical support}} {{from their home}} bases outside of Southeast Asia. Circumstances in the region, however, were leading to drastic changes in the US position. On 29 April 1961, the Joint Chiefs of Staff instructed CINCPAC to move 5,000 troops and air elements to both Udon Air Base and Da Nang Air Base. It was believed these forces <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> action in Laos. Also, in South Vietnam, the numbers of Communist insurgents continued to increase. More American military advisers were being dispatched to the country, but their reports indicted a need for stronger measures to be taken.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{backing from}} Sony, Media Molecule were unsure {{about exactly what}} {{direction}} they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the game. They also worried about whether people would understand, or even like the game, but these worries were dispelled after its first presentation. Media Molecule {{were aware of the}} fact that Sony wanted them to demonstrate the game at the upcoming GDC 2007, but they were not told they were to be part of Phil Harrison's keynote speech until near the date it was due to take place. Healey stated that it was only when they arrived in San Francisco for the conference that they realised just how much backing Sony were devoting to the game—much more than Media Molecule had previously thought. Healey relates that although the revelation of Sony's faith in the game boosted their confidence, additionally, it increased the pressure on them with the realisation that their task had become much greater than originally anticipated.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of Valve's statement, several of the {{gambling}} sites either went dark, closed off {{the use of the}} site by United States residents, or formally announced their closure, such as CSGODouble. Valve warned users that they should move any skins they have transferred to such sites back to their Steam inventory, while several affected sites have promised users they will automatically return skins in the near future. One site, OPSkins, remained active, claiming in a statement that they were not a gambling site and do not believe Valve can take action against them. CSGO Lounge had announced plans to obtain legal gambling licenses in the countries it plans to operate within, and restricting access to users from countries with these licenses. However, the site announced the following month that they were shutting down all virtual item gambling, offering users an opportunity to recover their virtual items, while shifting to a general eSports entertainment website. By January 2017, only about half of these sites contacted by Valve had been shut down, with more off-shore sites being set up around the time. Further, the newer skin gambling sites have kept low profiles, making skin gambling more of an underground economy that is more difficult to track. Around the same time, Valve announced that they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> similar action to block sites and accounts that engaged in gambling using Team Fortress 2 items.|$|E

500|$|Newspapers and {{journals}} {{around the world}} speculated that Brazil was acting {{as a proxy for}} a naval power which would take possession of the two dreadnoughts soon after completion, as they did not believe that a previously insignificant geopolitical power would contract for such powerful armament. The evidence for a sale seemed strong, as Brazilian attempts to float a multi-million-dollar loan against the value of their coffee crop in 1908 were unsuccessful. With three dreadnoughts planned (including the upcoming [...] ), a Spanish naval journal stated [...] "it was only natural that rumors [...] to circulate supporting the argument that Brazil acted as an intermediary for some great power which would acquire them before they terminate their construction." [...] Various British papers speculated that either the Germans, Japanese, or Americans were actually buying the ships, while naval experts in Germany thought the Americans, British, or Japanese <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them over. On {{the other side of the}} Atlantic, some American papers theorized that the ships would be sold to the United Kingdom, Germany, or Japan. The Brazilian government was forced to deny these spurious allegations several times. The New York Times remarked: ...|$|E

For example, in its editorial of 9 May 1956 [...] "Making martyrs", the Manchester Guardian didn't refer to EOKA {{as a terrorist}} organisation but as a [...] "movement."

2500|$|On November 27, Thanksgiving Day, TNA {{presented}} the Turkey Bowl. Alex Shelley {{ended up being}} pinned by Rhino, and Foley handed Rhino the check. Afterwards, the defeated Shelley had {{to put on a}} Turkey Suit in compliance with the match rules, albeit with much refusal. However, Shelley [...] "flipped off" [...] Foley and proceeded to beat him up. In the aftermath, Mick mentioned that Shelley is lucky he still has his job.

2500|$|Part of {{the problem}} {{might have been the}} sheer size of Rubinstein's hands. They were huge, and many {{observers}} commented on them. Josef Hofmann observed that Rubinstein's fifth finger [...] "was as thick as my thumb—think of it! [...] Then his fingers were square at the ends, with cushions on them. [...] It was a wonderful hand." [...] Pianist Josef Lhevinne described them as [...] "fat, pudgy ... with fingers so broad at the finger-tips that he often had difficulty in not striking two notes at once." [...] The German piano teacher Ludwig Deppe advised American pianist Amy Fay to watch carefully how Rubinstein struck his chords: [...] "Nothing cramped about him! [...] He spreads his hands as if he <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> in the universe, and takes them up with the greatest freedom and abandon!" ...|$|E

The DEA agents again asked Place for his identification, which he produced. The agents discovered that Place had no outstanding warrants. They {{then asked to}} search Place's luggage, but Place declined to allow the agents to do so. The agents then told Place they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the luggage to a federal judge to obtain a warrant to search the luggage, and that Place was free to accompany them if he chose to. An {{hour and a half}} later, the agents had taken Place's bags to Kennedy airport and allowed a trained narcotics detection dog to perform a [...] "sniff" [...] test. The dog detected the presence of narcotics. This was late on a Friday afternoon; the agents retained the luggage over the weekend until Monday, when they obtained a warrant to search the luggage. They discovered over a kilogram of cocaine.|$|E

2500|$|Schieble {{gave birth}} to Jobs on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco and chose an adoptive couple for him that was [...] "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy." [...] The couple changed their mind, however, and decided to adopt a girl instead. The baby boy was then placed with the Bay Area blue collar couple Paul and Clara Jobs, neither of whom had a college education, and Schieble refused to sign the {{adoption}} papers. She then took the matter to court {{in an attempt to}} have her baby placed with a different family and only consented to releasing the baby to Paul and Clara after they promised that he would attend college. When Steve Jobs was in high school, his mother Clara admitted to his girlfriend, 17-year-old Chrisann Brennan, that she [...] "was too frightened to love [...] {{for the first six months}} of his life ... I was scared they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him away from me. Even after we won the case, Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt we had made a mistake. I wanted to return him." [...] When Chrisann shared his mother's comment with Steve, he stated that he was already aware of that and would later say he was deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara. Many years later, Steve Jobs's wife Laurene also noted that [...] "he felt he had been really blessed by having the two of them as parents." [...] Jobs would become upset when Paul and Clara were referred to as [...] "adoptive parents" [...] as they [...] "were my parents 1,000%."
