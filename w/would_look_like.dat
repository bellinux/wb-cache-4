5|$|Every prime, non-split {{alternating}} knot or link complement has {{a subdivision}} rule, with some tiles {{that do not}} subdivide, corresponding to the boundary of the link complement. The subdivision rules show what the night sky <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> to someone living in a knot complement; because the universe wraps around itself (i.e. is not simply connected), an observer would see the visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. The subdivision rule describes that pattern.|$|E
5|$|Unable to find wind {{machines}} {{powerful enough}} to mimic hurricane-force winds, Sertner brought in a jet engine to aim at the actors and props during necessary scenes. Three dimensional storyboards, called animatics, were used to allow the filmmakers {{to see what a}} scene <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> before shooting, using a digital version of the actors. The various weather scenes blended together stock footage of real natural disasters with the computer-generated shots, with care taken to match up the details of the various scenes.|$|E
5|$|Carolyn Porco of NASA was {{consulted}} on {{the planetary}} science and imagery. The animators realistically recreated what an explosion <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> in space: short blasts, which suck inward and leave debris from a ship floating. For shots of an imploding planet, the same explosion program {{was used to}} simulate it breaking up, while the animators could manually composite multiple layers of rocks and wind sucking into the planet. Unlike other Star Trek films and series, the transporter beam effects swirl rather than speckle. Abrams conceived the redesign to emphasize the notion of transporters as beams that can pick up and move people, rather than a signal composed of scrambled atoms.|$|E

5|$|During the 1993 {{run for the}} {{national}} title, Smith used a method that was introduced to him {{at a conference in}} Switzerland. At the conference, Smith was presented a tape by a lecturer who used doctored images to achieve his goal of losing weight. The photos showed the lecturer what he <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> if he were thinner as motivation to reach his weight-loss goals. Smith took a picture of the scoreboard from the 1982 Championship, modified it to read 1993 and erased the name Georgetown, leaving that space blank. He proceeded to place copies of the doctored photo in all of the players' lockers.|$|E
5|$|ILM was {{tasked with}} imagining what the {{immediate}} assimilation of an Enterprise crewmember <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> Jaeger {{came up with}} a set of cables that sprang from the Borg's knuckles and buried themselves in the crewmember's neck. Wormlike tubes would course through the victim's body and mechanical devices break the skin. The entire transformation was created using computer-generated imagery. The wormlike geometry was animated over the actor's face, then blended in {{with the addition of a}} skin texture over the animation. The gradual change in skin tone was simulated with shaders.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{factor contributing to}} the game's protracted development was that Broussard was continually looking to add new elements to the game. A running joke at 3D Realms was to stop Broussard from seeing a new video game, as {{he would want to}} include portions of it in Duke Nukem Forever. Later that year, Broussard decided to upgrade to {{a new version of the}} Unreal engine that was designed for multiplayer matches. Former employees recalled that Broussard did not have a plan for what the finished game <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> At the same time, GT Interactive was facing higher-than-expected losses and hired Bear Stearns to look into selling the company or merging it. Later that year, Infogrames Entertainment announced it was purchasing a controlling interest in GT Interactive. The publishing rights for Duke Nukem Forever passed to Gathering of Developers in early December 2000.|$|E

5|$|Having {{received}} Nintendo 64DD development kits {{that included}} the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, Iguana Entertainment added an optional high-resolution mode to the game {{early on in the}} development cycle. In conjunction with the Expansion Pak, this mode allows the game to be played at a resolution of 640x480 pixels, a technical accomplishment for the Nintendo 64 at the time. An upgraded polygon modelling technique was used to give the game better-formed creatures. However, motion capture was avoided because none of game's enemies are human. Dienstbier felt that if their animations were motion captured, enemies <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a person pretending to be a lizard in a costume. The game features different animations for different creatures. Unlike its predecessor, where enemies have two types of death animations, Seeds of Evil includes a third and gorier one.|$|E
5|$|Life {{magazine}} {{decided to}} publish a photo story for their January 15, 1951 edition, which would document {{the results of the}} competition and feature a photograph of the protesters. Life initially wanted to photograph the painters {{on the steps of the}} Metropolitan, with their paintings. They refused on the grounds that it <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> they were trying to enter the museum, but were being rebuffed. The magazine capitulated; art editor for Life, Dorothy Seiberling, sent photographer Nina Leen to photograph them at a studio on 44th Street. They assembled there on November 24. Only three of the original signatories were absent: Weldon Kees, Hans Hofmann, and Fritz Bultman. Pollock made a special trip with James Brooks for the session.|$|E
5|$|Reptile later {{appears in}} the 1995 film Mortal Kombat as a bipedal lizard, camouflaging himself until found by Liu Kang. After being thrown into a statue, Reptile {{transforms}} into a human-looking ninja and battles Liu Kang, but is defeated and then crushed after reverting to his original form. Reptile's lizard form was rendered {{with the use of}} computer-generated imagery, while the character's human form is portrayed by Keith Cooke, clothed similar to Scorpion and Sub-Zero in the film, but green and with a fanged open mouth imprinted on his face mask. Originally not included in the movie, Reptile was added in response to focus groups being unimpressed with the original fights in the film. Actor Robin Shou (Liu Kang) and director Paul Anderson noted that neither knew what Reptile's lizard form <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> until after filming, making the pre-fight sequence difficult to shoot.|$|E

5|$|Ten {{months before}} Conran made the movie with his actors, he shot it entirely with stand-ins in Los Angeles and then created the whole movie in {{animatics}} {{so that the}} actors had {{an idea of what}} the film <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> and where to move on the soundstage. To prepare for the film, Conran had his cast watch old movies, such as Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not (1944) for Paltrow's performance and The Thin Man (1934) for the relationship between Nick and Nora that was to be echoed in the one between Joe and Polly. Avnet constantly pushed for room in this meticulously designed movie for the kind of freedom the actors needed, like being able to move around on the soundstage.|$|E
5|$|The Compsognathus {{specimen}} {{discovered in}} Germany in the 19th century featured only two digits on each forelimb, leading scientists {{to conclude that}} this was how the creature appeared in life. However, the fossil discovered later in France revealed the manus (hands) to have had three digits, similar to other members of compsognathid genera. The fossilization of the German Compsognathus had simply failed to preserve the specimen's hands completely. Bidar supposed that the French specimen had webbed hands, which <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> flippers in life. In the 1975 book The Evolution and Ecology of the Dinosaurs, L. B. Halstead depicts the animal as an amphibious dinosaur capable of feeding on aquatic prey and swimming {{out of reach of}} larger predators. Ostrom debunked this hypothesis by showing conclusively that the French specimen was nearly identical to the German specimen in every aspect but its size. Peyer confirmed these conclusions.|$|E
5|$|The {{intention}} {{to create the}} racing modes of the game had been present {{from the start of}} the project and Battle Mode was developed from the desire to create a one-on-one mode where victory was not determined simply by competing for rank. The game did not start out as a Mario series game and the first prototype featured a generic man in overalls in the kart; the team decided that characters three heads tall would best suit the design of the karts. They did not decide on incorporating Mario series characters into the game until two or three months after the start of development. The choice was made after the development team, when observing how one kart looked to another driving past it, decided to see what it <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> with Mario in the kart. Thinking that having Mario in the kart looked better than previous designs, the idea of a Mario themed racing game was born.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{video game}} adaptations of the Alien franchise, Alien: Isolation places {{a strong emphasis}} on stealth and survival horror gameplay, requiring the player to avoid and outsmart a single alien creature {{over the course of the}} game with the help of gadgets like a motion tracker and a flamethrower. It was designed more in line with Scott's film as opposed to James Cameron's more action-oriented 1986 sequel Aliens, and features a similar lo-fi, 1970s vision of what the future <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> The game runs on an entirely new engine that was built from scratch to accommodate technical aspects like the game's atmospheric and lighting effects as well as the alien's behavioural design. Creative Assembly originally intended to make Alien: Isolation a third-person game, but the perspective was later changed to first-person in order to create a more intense experience.|$|E
5|$|An {{article in}} The Times on 17 February 1919 by Rudyard Kipling carried the Commission's {{proposal}} {{to a wider}} audience and described what the graves <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> The article entitled War Graves: Work of Imperial Commission: Mr. Kipling's Survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet, Graves of the Fallen. The illustrated booklet was intended to soften the impact of Kenyon's report as it included illustrations of cemeteries with mature trees and shrubs; contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos. There was an immediate public outcry following {{the publication of the}} reports, particularly with regards to the decision to not repatriate the bodies of the dead. The reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a heated debate in Parliament on 4 May 1920. Sir James Remnant started the debate, followed by speeches by William Burdett-Coutts in favour of the Commission's principles and Robert Cecil speaking for those desiring repatriation and opposing uniformity of grave markers. Winston Churchill closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote. Remnant withdrew his motion, allowing the Commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, {{the agents}} again meet with Dr. Theresa Shannon, and she further {{discusses}} the spree of murders that occurred ten years ago. According to Shannon, five {{people were killed}} at the clinic: four patients and a cosmetic doctor named Clifford Cox, who ostensibly died of a drug overdose. Following his intuition, Mulder discovers that the birthdays of the four patients also match up with the dates of the Witches' Sabbath but that Dr. Clifford Cox's birthday does not. Mulder then uses the hospital's computer program to determine what Franklin <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> had he undergone heavy plastic surgery. The computer produces an image that looks like Franklin, suggesting that he is actually Dr. Clifford Cox in disguise. When Dr. Shannon discovers Cox alone in a blood-spattered operating room, he uses uses witchcraft to magically teleport surgical tools into her intestines, which causes her to bleed internally. Luckily, Dr. Shannon is rushed into surgery and survives. Cox, however, escapes; he is later seen removing {{the skin of his}} face and performing a ritual to make him appear younger. It is revealed that Cox murders in a quest to gain eternal youth. The episode ends with a now-young Cox successfully applying for a position at another medical hospital.|$|E

5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E
