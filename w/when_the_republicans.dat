However, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> retook {{the majority in the}} state legislature, Harrison's election to a six-year term in the U.S. Senate was threatened by Judge Walter Q.

5|$|After Pierce died, he mostly {{passed from}} the American consciousness, except {{as one of a}} series of presidents whose {{disastrous}} tenures led to civil war. Pierce's presidency is widely regarded as a failure; he is often described as one of the worst presidents in American history. The public placed him third-to-last among his peers in C-SPAN surveys (2000 and 2009). Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative, most disastrously with the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Although he did not lead that fight—Senator Douglas did—Pierce paid the cost in damage to his reputation. The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped bring an end to the dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> mostly controlled national politics.|$|E

500|$|The {{move towards}} greater {{involvement}} in political {{issues and the}} increasing popularity of the show in certain key demographics have led to examinations of where {{the views of the}} show fit in the political spectrum.

Stewart, who voted Democratic in the 2004 presidential election, acknowledged that the show has a more liberal point of view, but that it is not [...] "a liberal organization" [...] with a political agenda and its duty first and foremost is to be funny. He acknowledges that the show is not necessarily an [...] "equal opportunity offender", explaining that Republicans tended to provide more comedic fodder because [...] "I think we consider those with power and influence targets and those without it, not." [...] In an interview in 2005, when asked how he responded to critics claiming that The Daily Show is overly liberal, Stephen Colbert, also a self-proclaimed Democrat, said in an interview during the Bush Administration, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> held a majority in the House and Senate: [...] "We are liberal, but Jon's very respectful of the Republican guests, and, listen, if liberals were in power {{it would be easier to}} attack them, but Republicans have the executive, legislative and judicial branches, so making fun of Democrats is like kicking a child, so it's just not worth it." ...|$|E
