5|$|Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion for the Court, which declined to overturn the state court's decision because fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody.

Facts weighing against custody included that Alvarado <b>was</b> <b>not</b> transported to the police station by police, Alvarado <b>was</b> <b>not</b> threatened or told he would be placed under arrest, and the interview focused on the crimes of Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes. The Court <b>was</b> <b>not</b> tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody, rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision was reasonable because it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> clearly unreasonable.|$|E
