500|$|Frank Lovece of Film Journal International, one of few {{mainstream}} {{critics to}} {{have read the}} comic-book miniseries, said that the film compared poorly with the source material.

Kaif used her life in London as a reference {{for her role as}} a spoilt British Indian girl intent on marrying her self-centred British boyfriend, despite her parents' disapproval. Although critics expressed mixed views on the film, Sukanya Verma wrote that Kaif [...] "suits the role to the T" [...] and [...] "brings the zingy mix of her character alive <b>with</b> <b>style</b> and substance". Kaif's chemistry with co-star Akshay Kumar was particularly well received, with Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India calling their casting [...] "refreshing".|$|E

Kasavin complimented the game's eclectic soundtrack, excellent voice acting, and distinctive sound effects, while the GamePro reviewer panned them as minimalist and irritating. IGN's Matt Casamassina likened the control scheme to [...] "old-school adventure games like Myst and Snatcher" [...] and commended Suda51 for making a [...] "cult hit", [...] "erupting <b>with</b> <b>style,</b> mood and undiluted craziness".

L.L. Cool J {{is one of the best}} young talkologists around, because he speaks directly to and about his generation over large beats that recall Run-D.M.C., Trouble Funk, James Brown, and funky little bits of AC/DC and Yes ... This teenage music is built around beats, but not just any old beats. It is all about a beat <b>with</b> <b>style,</b> with personality, and L.L. Cool J has plenty of both." ...|$|E

In a review for AllMusic, Mark Deming said that the single [...] "was {{a far cry from}} anything the Bangles had recorded before"; while Matthew Greenwald, also from the website, said [...] "It's a clever and deceptively simple pop narrative, an infectious pop confection ... There is also an excellently written bridge that shows Prince/ Christopher to be an excellent craftsman, and, to their credit, the Bangles carry it off <b>with</b> <b>style</b> and wit". Robert Hilburn from Los Angeles Times called the song [...] "a candidate for best single of the year".

500|$|Art pop {{emphasizes}} {{the manipulation of}} signs over personal expression, drawing on an aesthetic of the everyday and the disposable, in distinction to the Romantic and autonomous tradition embodied by art rock (also known as progressive rock). Sociomusicologist Simon Frith has distinguished the appropriation of art into pop music as having a particular concern <b>with</b> <b>style,</b> gesture, and the ironic use of historical eras and genres. Drawing on postmodernism's breakdown of the high/low cultural boundary, Frith says that art pop artists trouble issues of sociological interpretation and historical authenticity, instead exploring concepts of artifice. Central to particular purveyors of the style were notions of the self {{as a work of}} construction and artifice, as well as a preoccupation with the invention of terms, imagery, process, and affect. Cultural theorist Mark Fisher wrote that the development of art pop evolved out of the triangulation of pop, art, and fashion. Frith states that it was [...] "more or less" [...] directly inspired by Pop art.|$|E
500|$|Bosanquet did not bat {{in a style}} {{typical of}} a cricketer from Eton, where batsmen were taught to play <b>with</b> <b>style</b> and grace. Warner {{described}} him as [...] "decidedly stiff and awkward looking... He {{does not seem to}} play the ball in a free, unconstrained way, but rather stabs at it and gives one the impression of making his stroke at the very last moment." [...] In Australia, Bosanquet was troubled by fast pitches and struggled against bowlers such as Monty Noble and Bert Hopkins who could make the ball move towards him through the air. Nevertheless, he displayed great confidence in his ability and on a pitch which assisted spinners, he could flick the ball onto the leg side very effectively. He could hit the ball hard, particularly when driving. The Times said: [...] "He had a wonderful eye and great strength of fore-arm and anything short he could hit very hard." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to numerous awards, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was included on several year-end lists by film commentators and publications. It {{was named the}} best film of 2011 by MTV and James Berardinelli of ReelViews. The former wrote, [...] "The director follows up the excellent Social Network with another tour de force, injecting the murder mystery that introduces us to outcast hacker Lisbeth Salander [...] and embattled journalist [...] <b>with</b> <b>style,</b> intensity and relentless suspense. Mara is a revelation, and the film's daunting 160-minute runtime breezes by thanks to one heart-racing scene after the next. Dark and tough to watch at times, but a triumph all around." [...] The film came second in indieWire list of [...] "Drew Taylor's Favorite Films Of 2011", while reaching the top ten of seven other publications, including the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, San Francisco Chronicle, and the New Orleans Times-Picayune. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was declared {{one of the best}} films {{of the year by the}} American Film Institute, as well as the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the film's detractors, The New York Times's Nathan Lee said Friday the 13th managed to [...] "reboot the concept" [...] of the original films <b>with</b> <b>style.</b> Lee said the film takes pleasure in killing off each of its characters, {{that there is a}} desire among cinemagoers for this type of material, and that Friday the 13th satisfies that desire. Adam Graham from The Detroit News said the film is the most effective and scary film in the Friday the 13th series; he praised its choice of allowing Jason to run after his victimsas opposed to slowly walking behind them, as became prominent in later sequelsbecause it made him more menacing. Graham also said the film does not [...] "soften" [...] Jason's scariness by providing a sympathetic backstory. Entertainment Weeklys Clark Collis said director Nispel made a competent film that performs better as a whole than the previously released remakes of Prom Night (2008) and My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009), although it does provide a few too many unbelievable character moments.|$|E

Overall, Lawson was well received in the United States. Those who did criticise her often suggested she was too flirtatious; a commentator from The New York Times said, [...] "Lawson's sexy roundness mixed with her speed-demon technique makes cooking dinner with Nigella look like a prelude to an orgy". The book of Nigella Bites became the second bestselling cook book of Christmas 2002 in America. The series was followed by Forever Summer with Nigella in 2002 on Channel 4, the concept being, [...] "that you cook to make you still feel as though you're on holiday". Fellow food writer Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall condemned the conceit as [...] "cynical and reckless" [...] and referred to the book as Fuck Seasonality.|$|E
