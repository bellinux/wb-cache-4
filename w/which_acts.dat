5|$|For Kant a {{good will}} is a broader {{conception}} than a will <b>which</b> <b>acts</b> from duty. A will <b>which</b> <b>acts</b> from duty is distinguishable as a will which overcomes hindrances {{in order to}} keep the moral law. A dutiful will is thus a special case of a good will which becomes visible in adverse conditions. Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth. This is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, <b>which</b> <b>acts</b> to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, <b>which</b> <b>acts</b> to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E

5|$|The {{player can}} choose from five skills to {{overcome}} situations: Stealth, Athletics, Lore, Mechanics and Survival. As the player fights more creatures, more information is added to their bestiary. This helps the player collect information about how to attack them effectively. Early in the game, the protagonist will take over a stronghold, <b>which</b> <b>acts</b> as the party's fortress. This can be upgraded.|$|E

5|$|A major {{branch of}} {{numerical}} analysis {{is devoted to}} the development of efficient algorithms for matrix computations, a subject that is centuries old and is today an expanding area of research. Matrix decomposition methods simplify computations, both theoretically and practically. Algorithms that are tailored to particular matrix structures, such as sparse matrices and near-diagonal matrices, expedite computations in finite element method and other computations. Infinite matrices occur in planetary theory and in atomic theory. A simple example of an infinite matrix is the matrix representing the derivative operator, <b>which</b> <b>acts</b> on the Taylor series of a function.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} {{function}} in locomotion, the tube feet act as accessory gills. The water vascular system serves to transport oxygen from, {{and carbon dioxide}} to, the tube feet and also nutrients from the gut to the muscles involved in locomotion. Fluid movement is bidirectional and initiated by cilia. Gas exchange also takes place through other gills known as papulae, which are thin-walled bulges on the aboral surface of the disc and arms. Oxygen is transferred from these to the coelomic fluid, <b>which</b> <b>acts</b> as the transport medium for gasses. Oxygen dissolved in the water is distributed through the body mainly by the fluid in the main body cavity; the circulatory system may also play a minor role.|$|E

50|$|But {{in order}} to achieve trim, {{stability}} and control, most fixed-wing types have an empennage comprising a fin and rudder <b>which</b> <b>act</b> horizontally and a tailplane and elevator <b>which</b> <b>act</b> vertically. This is so common that it is known as the conventional layout. Sometimes there may be two or more fins, spaced out along the tailplane.|$|R
5|$|Bacterial species {{differ in}} the number and {{arrangement}} of flagella on their surface; some have a single flagellum (monotrichous), a flagellum at each end (amphitrichous), clusters of flagella at the poles of the cell (lophotrichous), while others have flagella distributed over the entire surface of the cell (peritrichous). The bacterial flagella is the best-understood motility structure in any organism and is made of about 20 proteins, with approximately another 30 proteins required for its regulation and assembly. The flagellum is a rotating structure driven by a reversible motor at the base that uses the electrochemical gradient across the membrane for power. This motor drives {{the motion of the}} filament, <b>which</b> <b>acts</b> as a propeller.|$|E
5|$|Between Atherley and Tiverton, Highway21 travels straight-as-an-arrow along {{what was}} {{originally}} a rural concession road through the hamlets of Reid's Corners, Pine River, Huron Ridge and Slade. It bypasses inland of Kincardine, intersecting the western terminus of Highway9. Within Tiverton, <b>which</b> <b>acts</b> {{as the primary}} town serving Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, traffic must turn to remain on Highway21. As it exits southeast from the town, the highway makes a broad curve to the northeast and continues through the hamlets of Underwood and North Bruce.|$|E
5|$|Ferry {{passengers}} {{would face}} a lengthier trek {{to reach the}} new pier. By relocating the new piers 300 m away, {{it is estimated that}} the Star Ferry could lose perhaps 13 percent or more of passengers due to its inconvenience. On the Tsim Sha Tsui side of the harbour, the proposed relocation of the bus terminus <b>which</b> <b>acts</b> as a feeder for the ferry is forecast to further reduce passenger numbers by one-fifth.|$|E

5|$|Following this defeat, Shiva {{abandons}} {{the plan}} of invading Meluha and leave for Pariha with Gopal; they wanted to procure the deadly Brahmastra weapon, to threaten the Meluhans for peace with them. There he meets the chief of Vayuputras, Mithra, who {{turns out to be}} his maternal uncle. Mithra convinces the Vayuputras that Shiva is the real Neelkanth and gives him the Pashupathiastra <b>which</b> <b>acts</b> on a specific target, rather than annihilating everything like the Brahmastra. Meanwhile, Parvateshwar uses decoy ships to give an impression to Kali {{that he was going to}} attack Panchavati. Alarmed, Kali takes the bait and leaves with the finest Naga soldiers in their pursuit. However, she realizes her folly and returns.|$|E
5|$|Impermeable plasma {{is a type}} {{of thermal}} plasma <b>which</b> <b>acts</b> like an {{impermeable}} solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by Hannes Alfvén in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of fusion plasma from the reactor walls. However, later {{it was found that the}} external magnetic fields in this configuration could induce kink instabilities in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls.|$|E

Country singer Thomas Rhett recorded a cover of the song as a 'thank-you' to fans. The song was released for sale on February 3, 2015 and it debuted at No. 27 on the Hot Country Songs chart and despite failing to reach the Billboard Hot 100, it peaked inside of the Bubbling Under Hot 100, <b>which</b> <b>acts</b> {{as an extension of}} the former chart, peaking at number 7 there.|$|E

5|$|Severe {{disease is}} marked by the {{problems}} of capillary permeability (an allowance of fluid and protein normally contained within blood to pass) and disordered blood clotting. These changes appear associated with a disordered state of the endothelial glycocalyx, <b>which</b> <b>acts</b> as a molecular filter of blood components. Leaky capillaries (and the critical phase) {{are thought to be}} caused by an immune system response. Other processes of interest include infected cells that become necrotic—which affect both coagulation and fibrinolysis (the opposing systems of blood clotting and clot degradation)—and low platelets in the blood, also a factor in normal clotting.|$|E
5|$|Since the anemone lacks a rigid skeleton, the {{contractile}} cells pull {{against the}} fluid in the gastrovascular cavity, forming a hydrostatic skeleton. The anemone stabilizes itself by flattening its pharynx <b>which</b> <b>acts</b> as a valve, keeping the gastrovascular cavity {{at a constant}} volume and making it rigid. When the longitudinal muscles relax, the pharynx opens and the cilia lining the siphonoglyphs beat, wafting water inwards and refilling the gastrovascular cavity. In general, the sea anemone inflates its body to extend its tentacles and feed, and deflates it when resting or disturbed. The inflated body {{is also used to}} anchor the animal inside a crevice, burrow or tube.|$|E
5|$|The Lower Earley development, {{built in}} 1977, {{was one of}} the largest private housing {{developments}} in Europe. It extended the urban area of Reading as far as the M4 motorway, <b>which</b> <b>acts</b> as the southern boundary of the town. Further housing developments have increased the number of modern houses and hypermarkets in the outskirts of Reading. A major town-centre shopping centre, The Oracle, opened in 1999, is named after the 17th century Oracle workhouse, which once occupied {{a small part of the}} site.
