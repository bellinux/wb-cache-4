5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the coins (e.g. {{providing}} kings' names), they have proved essential in constructing a chronology of the Kings of Aksum. An estimated 98 percent of the city of Aksum remains unexcavated, and other areas even more so. Through analysis of the number of coins produced and the style of coins, archaeologists have been able to construct a rough chronology, generally agreed upon until the late 6th- and 7th-century kings. Of the 20 Aksumite Kings attested by their coins, inscriptions corroborate the existence of only two, <b>who</b> <b>happen</b> to be the most famous kings: Ezana and Kaleb, both of whose reigns were periods of exceptional prosperity during the height of the Aksumite kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the party}} {{continues}} {{and the party}} goers force Burns' monkeys into having a knife fight. The yacht is eventually boarded by Chinese pirates who take the ship hostage. The pirates rob everyone on board and tie them up in a net which they then toss overboard. But to the luck of Homer {{and some of the}} other guests <b>who</b> <b>happen</b> to be above ocean surface level, it floats and they avoid drowning. Eventually Homer and Bart make it back to the mansion where the family returns the house to Burns after Marge and Lisa have scrubbed all the rooms clean. Back at the Simpsons home, everyone is glad to live a normal life again—with the exception of Homer, who is upset that he does not live the lifestyle of rich people. The episode ends with Homer wailing about how rich all the persons in the closing credits are (except Richard K. Chung, whom he dismisses as poor) and threatening to report them to the Internal Revenue Service and telling the Gracie Films woman not to shush him.|$|E

However, the First World War is on and all the men are fighting at the four corners of the empire and therefore can not respond to the appeal. The young children of Van want to do something and when the principal of a school, who has lost a son in the war, suggests that they transport ammunition, 120 young boys aged 12 to 17 volunteer and take to the road. The movie tells the true story of the 120 boys and their sisters and mothers left behind, who wait for their return.|$|E

500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, Lewis was {{inspired}} by house parties at Jonathan Wilson's Laurel Canyon home. [...] "We'd go to these jams in the canyon. They're fantastic. Jonathan invites older session musicians from the real Laurel Canyon era, and younger {{people who are just}} starting their bands <b>who</b> <b>happen</b> to live in the canyon, and we all get together and sing Grateful Dead covers and J. J. Cale songs." [...] Lewis herself has said that it [...] "rocks a little harder," [...] in contrast to Rabbit Fur Coats folk rock influences. Lewis also used Rilo Kiley's Under the Blacklight, which was notably polished compared to the band's earlier work, [...] "as a reference point to go in the complete opposite direction". She explained that every song she writes is [...] "a response to the thing that I've written before". [...] "It's even as simple as, 'OK, I've written a ballad, now I want to push myself to write something that's up tempo.' If I'm writing about myself, well, that subject can be tiresome, so then I focus on character-driven songs. So I'm always doing this back-and-forth just to keep myself interested." ...|$|E
500|$|VanAirsdale {{cited the}} release date and {{screening}} {{as the third}} and fourth reasons; he said there was confusion about what day the film was going to debut in theaters, and that Toronto is [...] "a nation removed from the audience where the film's actual momentum had been accruing for at least a month" [...] and that [...] "this rarely works for early fall releases; not because news doesn’t travel, obviously, but because it peels away a layer of accessibility that accompanies New York and L.A. bows." [...] The final reason, he attributed to the critics, believing that the fusion of horror and teen comedy confused some of them. He mentioned Ty Burr's review in particular, and stated that the film could perhaps have used more horror and been funnier, but that the film is [...] "ultimately a movie about two teenage girls' misadventures in victimization" [...] and that [...] "he jokes are virtually incidental to the friction imposed on women <b>who</b> <b>happen</b> to be {{two sides of the same}} coin.

500|$|The Monster, whose {{affections}} for {{the male}} hermit and the female Bride he discusses with identical language ("friend") has been read as sexually [...] "unsettled" [...] and bisexual. Gender studies author Elizabeth Young writes: [...] "He has no innate understanding that the male-female bond he is to forge with the bride {{is assumed to be}} the primary one or that it carries a different sexual valence from his relationships with : all affective relationships are as easily 'friendships' as 'marriages'." [...] Indeed, his relationship with the hermit has been interpreted as a same-sex marriage that heterosexual society will not tolerate: [...] "No mistake– this is a marriage, and a viable one... But Whale reminds us quickly that society does not approve. The monster– the outsider– is driven from his scene of domestic pleasure by two gun-toting rubes <b>who</b> <b>happen</b> upon this startling alliance and quickly, instinctively, proceed to destroy it", writes cultural critic Gary Morris for Bright Lights Film Journal. The creation of the Bride scene, Morris continues, is [...] "Whale's reminder to the audience– his Hollywood bosses, peers, and everyone watching– of the majesty and power of the homosexual creator".|$|E
500|$|Media theorist Siobhan Lyons {{similarly}} {{disagrees with}} the dream theory, arguing {{that it is a}} [...] "superficial interpretation [...] undermines the strength of the absurdity of reality that often takes place in Lynch’s universe". Instead, Lyons posits that Betty and Diane are in fact two different people <b>who</b> <b>happen</b> to look similar, a common motif among Hollywood starlets. In a similar interpretation, Betty and Rita and Diane and Camilla may exist in parallel universes that sometimes interconnect. Another theory offered is that the narrative is a Möbius strip, a twisted band that has no beginning and no end. Or the entire film is a dream, but whose dream is unknown. Repeated references to beds, bedrooms and sleeping symbolize the heavy influence of dreams. Rita falls asleep several times; in between these episodes, disconnected scenes such as the men having a conversation at Winkie's, Betty's arrival in Los Angeles and the bungled hit take place, suggesting that Rita may be dreaming them. The opening shot of the film zooms into a bed containing an unknown sleeper, instilling, according to film scholar Ruth Perlmutter, the necessity to ask if what follows is reality. Professor of dream studies Kelly Bulkeley argues that the early scene at the diner, as the only one in which dreams or dreaming are explicitly mentioned, illustrates [...] "revelatory truth and epistemological uncertainty in Lynch's film". The monstrous being from the dream, who is the subject of conversation of the men in Winkie's, reappears {{at the end of the}} film right before and after Diane commits suicide. Bulkeley asserts that the lone discussion of dreams in that scene presents an opening to [...] "a new way of understanding everything that happens in the movie".|$|E
500|$|Soon I Will Be Invincible takes characters, settings, and storylines {{generally}} {{associated with}} the comic book format and re-casts them using the novel's prose format. This use of superhero fiction in an alternate format was compared to other similar, successful attempts, like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films, Brad Bird's The Incredibles, and the TV serial No Heroics. Several reviewers contrasted the novel's elements of realism with Alan Moore's Watchmen and Rick Veitch's Bratpack which portrayed a darker side of more realistic superheroes. Novels cited as being similar included Donald Barthelme's Snow White, Robert Coover's Stepmother, and the works of Michael Chabon and Jonathan Lethem. The novel format allowed for more character development, which Grossman took advantage of by portraying them as [...] "real, human characters, {{with all of the}} foibles that come with the territory" [...] in what one reviewer called a [...] "hybridization of character and genre". Grossman described it as [...] "a book about real people <b>who</b> <b>happen</b> to be [...] or supervillains" [...] and that if it were a comic, it would be [...] "page after page of thought balloons". Compared to comic stories, the reviewer for the Richmond Times-Dispatch wrote [...] "The common denominator for most superhero comic books is that they don't make fun of themselves - the believability of their stories is never called into question. They take the heroes seriously. Not so in literature. When a novel appears with comic books as its focus, its author will undoubtedly believe that his or her theme is far more important - far more serious - than the comic books that inspired them. ... tries to do it all, combining humor and comic-book adventure with a literary sense of character. ...The result is a postmodern, inventive, comic-book plot with literary aspirations, and its only problem is that it isn't entirely successful as either humor or as straight adventure." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dizygotic (DZ) or {{fraternal twins}} (also {{referred}} to as [...] "non-identical twins", [...] "dissimilar twins", [...] "biovular twins", and, informally {{in the case of}} females, [...] "sororal twins") usually occur when two fertilized eggs are implanted in the uterus wall at the same time. When two eggs are independently fertilized by two different sperm cells, fraternal twins result. The two eggs, or ova, form two zygotes, hence the terms dizygotic and biovular. Fraternal twins are, essentially, two ordinary siblings <b>who</b> <b>happen</b> to be born at the same time, since they arise from two separate eggs fertilized by two separate sperm, just like ordinary siblings.|$|E
