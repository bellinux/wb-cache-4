5|$|The {{red panda}} (Ailurus fulgens), {{also called the}} lesser panda, the red bear-cat, and the red cat-bear, is a mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. It has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a <b>waddling</b> <b>gait</b> due to its shorter front legs; it is {{roughly the size of}} a {{domestic}} cat, though with a longer body and somewhat heavier. It is arboreal, feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats eggs, birds, and insects. It is a solitary animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day.|$|E
25|$|The {{legs are}} short, and their feet are adapted for {{perching}} rather than walking, {{as the front}} toes are partially joined at the base. Swallows are capable of walking and even running, but they do so with a shuffling, <b>waddling</b> <b>gait.</b> The leg muscles of the river martins (Pseudochelidon) are stronger and more robust than those of other swallows. The river martins have other characteristics that separate them from the other swallows. The structure of the syrinx is substantially different between the two subfamilies; and in most swallows the bill, legs and feet are dark brown or black, but in the river martins the bill is orange-red and the legs and feet are pink.|$|E
500|$|Like other parrots, {{cockatoos}} have short legs, strong claws, a <b>waddling</b> <b>gait</b> {{and often}} use their strong bill {{as a third}} limb when climbing through branches. They generally have long broad wings used in rapid flight, with speeds up to [...] being recorded for galahs. The members of the genus Calyptorhynchus and larger white cockatoos, such as the sulphur-crested cockatoo and Major Mitchell's cockatoo, have shorter, rounder wings and a more leisurely flight.|$|E

40|$|The waddles mouse is {{characterized}} by a namesake <b>waddling</b> “side-to-side” <b>gait,</b> which {{is the result of a}} deficiency in the enzyme carbonic anhydrase type 8 known to inhibit the binding of inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate to receptors on intracellular calcium stores. Behavioral experiments were conducted utilizing a rota-rod apparatus to further characterize this ataxia. The results indicated the homozygotes performed significantly worse than heterozygotes or wild type animals, and that younger homozygotes outperformed older cohorts. To elucidate potential alterations in cellular calcium signaling, acute cerebellar slices from the vermis were harvested for calcium imaging experiments in vitro. These experiments revealed significant alterations in granule cell somatic calcium signaling in waddles mice. I propose that cerebellar calcium signalling is altered in waddles mice, and that these alterations may be contributing to the observed ataxia through developmental mechanisms. These results will aid in understanding ataxias whose pathological basis involves alterations in neuronal calcium signaling...|$|R
500|$|Colonies {{are mostly}} on islands {{where there are}} no {{terrestrial}} predators but adult birds and newly fledged chicks are at risk of attacks from the air by gulls and skuas. Sometimes a bird such as an Arctic skua will harass a puffin arriving with a beakful of fish, causing it to drop its catch. The striking appearance, large colourful bill, <b>waddling</b> <b>gait</b> and behaviour of this bird have given rise to nicknames such as [...] "clown of the sea" [...] and [...] "sea parrot".

500|$|The Egyptian vulture {{is usually}} seen singly or in pairs, soaring in {{thermals}} {{along with other}} scavengers and birds of prey, or perched {{on the ground or}} atop a building. On the ground, they walk with a <b>waddling</b> <b>gait.</b> They feed on a range of food, including mammal faeces (including those of humans), insects in dung, carrion, vegetable matter, and sometimes small animals. When it joins other vulture species at a dead animal, it tends to stay on the periphery and waits until the larger species leave. Wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) form {{a significant part of the}} diet of Spanish vultures. In the Iberian Peninsula, landfills are an important food source, with the vultures more likely to occupy territories close to landfill sites. [...] Studies suggest that they feed on ungulate faeces to obtain carotenoid pigments responsible for their bright yellow and orange facial skin. The ability to assimilate carotenoid pigments may serve as a reliable signal of fitness.|$|E
500|$|The common {{starling}} is [...] long, with a wingspan of [...] and {{a weight}} of [...] Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the culmen is [...] and the tarsus is [...] The plumage is iridescent black, glossed purple or green, and spangled with white, especially in winter. The underparts of adult male common starlings are less spotted {{than those of}} adult females {{at a given time}} of year. The throat feathers of males are long and loose and are used in display while those of females are smaller and more pointed. The legs are stout and pinkish- or greyish-red. The bill is narrow and conical with a sharp tip; in the winter it is brownish-black but in summer, females have lemon yellow beaks while males have yellow bills with blue-grey bases. Moulting occurs once a year- in late summer after the breeding season has finished; the fresh feathers are prominently tipped white (breast feathers) or buff (wing and back feathers), which gives the bird a speckled appearance. The reduction in the spotting in the breeding season is achieved through the white feather tips largely wearing off. Juveniles are grey-brown and by their first winter resemble adults though often retaining some brown juvenile feathering, especially on the head. They can usually be sexed by the colour of the irises, rich brown in males, mouse-brown or grey in females. Estimating the contrast between an iris and the central always-dark pupil is 97% accurate in determining sex, rising to 98% if the length of the throat feathers is also considered. The common starling is mid-sized by both starling standards and passerine standards. It is readily distinguished from other mid-sized passerines, such as thrushes, icterids or small corvids, by its relatively short tail, sharp, blade-like bill, round-bellied shape and strong, sizeable (and rufous-coloured) legs. In flight, its strongly pointed wings and dark colouration are distinctive, while on the ground its strange, somewhat <b>waddling</b> <b>gait</b> is also characteristic. The colouring and build usually distinguish this bird from other starlings, although the closely related spotless starling may be physically distinguished by the lack of iridescent spots in adult breeding plumage.|$|E

There were, indeed, myriads of wild fowl flying about the ship, on which the men feasted and grew fat every day; and the muskets of Meetuck, and those who accompanied him, seldom failed to supply the ship with an abundance of the flesh of seals, walrus, and polar bears, portions of all of which creatures were considered very good indeed by the men, and particularly by the dogs, which grew so fat that they began to acquire a very disreputable <b>waddle</b> in their <b>gait</b> as they walked the deck for exercise, which they seldom did, by the way, being passionately fond of sleep!

The ex-prize-fighter McMurdo had, I found, been arrested as an accessory, and both he and Mr. Sholto had been marched off to the station.
