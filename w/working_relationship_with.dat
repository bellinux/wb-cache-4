5|$|One of Chamberlin's {{challenges}} {{was working}} with the Australians. Their decentralized mode of planning was entirely different from the top-down approach used by GHQ, and Chamberlin found this a source of frustration, as {{it was difficult to}} extract information from them.

5|$|After {{the coup}} and Piłsudski's reign as dictator, he often clashed with Catholic leaders but nevertheless, enjoyed good <b>working</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Cardinal Aleksander Kakowski, who {{subsequently}} led his funeral mass. In 1937, Archbishop of Kraków, Adam Stefan Sapieha, ordered to move Piłsudski's coffin from St. Leonard's Crypt to Royal Tombs at Wawel. This led to open {{conflict with the}} church and the government, which threatened to step down.|$|E

5|$|Britten {{had been}} in poor health since {{undergoing}} heart surgery in 1973, and on 4 December 1976 he died. Imogen was unsure that she could maintain a <b>working</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Pears alone, and on reaching the age of 70 decided she would retire as artistic director after the 1977 festival. That year she made her final festival appearance as a performer when she stood in for the indisposed conductor André Previn at the Snape Maltings Training Orchestra's inaugural festival concert.

The latter was both the last film directed by Ritt (who died later that year) and the last for which Frank and Ravetch wrote the screenplay.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009, the Papua New Guinea Rugby Football Union (PNGRFU) hired Serevi {{to become}} their sevens {{development}} officer on a five-year contract. He was later appointed the national sevens coach. However, on 27 March 2010, the PNGRFU {{confirmed that the}} <b>working</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Serevi was finished. Union president Richard Sapias said off-field decisions prompted the severing of relations, especially after Papua New Guinea performed poorly at the Adelaide sevens.|$|E
5|$|On November 6, 1996 CMLL {{took the}} CMLL World Women's Championship away from then reigning {{champion}} Reina Jubuki {{because she had}} wrestled on a World Championship Wrestling (WCW) show in North America {{only a few days}} prior. At the time WCW had a <b>working</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA), CMLL's main rival in Mexico and thus appearing for WCW was enough for CMLL to sever ties with Jubuki. CMLL held a tournament to crown a new champion only 2 days after announcing the title being vacated, choosing four of their top female competitors for a quick four-woman tournament.|$|E

5|$|Revelation is {{the ninth}} studio album by American Christian rock band Third Day, {{released}} on July 29, 2008. The album {{was produced by}} Howard Benson, who had decided {{to work with the}} band after rock singer Chris Daughtry drew attention to lead singer Mac Powell's vocal ability. Although they were initially uncomfortable working with Benson, Third Day achieved a positive <b>working</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Benson, who felt that their different religious beliefs made them challenge each other in a way reflected in the record.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{to hire an}} A-list ensemble cast for Mars Attacks! parallels the strategy Irwin Allen used for his disaster films, notably The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and The Towering Inferno (1974). Jack Nicholson, approached {{for the role of}} president, jokingly remarked he wanted to play all the roles. Burton agreed to cast Nicholson as both Art Land and President Dale, specifically remembering his positive <b>working</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> the actor on Batman.|$|E

5|$|According to Daniel Domscheit-Berg, {{a former}} WikiLeaks spokesperson, {{part of the}} WikiLeaks {{security}} concept was {{that they did not}} know who their sources were. The New York Times wrote in December 2010 that the U.S. government was trying to discover whether Assange had been a passive recipient of material from Manning, or had encouraged or helped her to extract the files; if the latter, Assange could be charged with conspiracy. Manning told Lamo in May 2010 that she had developed a <b>working</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Assange, communicating directly with him using an encrypted Internet conferencing service, but knew little about him. WikiLeaks did not identify Manning as their source. Army investigators found pages of chats on Manning's computer between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange. Nicks writes that, despite this, no decisive evidence was found of Assange's offering Manning any direction.|$|E
5|$|After {{removing}} her corpse {{from the}} canvas sack and beginning the post mortem examination, pathologist Keith Simpson told Ranson {{he was certain}} that Rivett had been killed before her body was placed in the sack, and that in his opinion the lead pipe found at the scene could be the murder weapon. Her estranged husband, Roger, had an alibi for the night concerned, and was eliminated from police inquiries. Other male friends and boyfriends were questioned and discounted as suspects. Her parents confirmed that Sandra had a good <b>working</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Lady Lucan, and was extremely fond of the children. Meanwhile, Lucan had yet to make an appearance, and so his description was circulated to police forces across the country. Newspapers and television stations were told only that Lucan was wanted by the police for questioning.|$|E
5|$|As Tchaikovsky {{had become}} Rubinstein's best-known student, he was {{initially}} considered by association {{as a natural}} target for attack, especially as fodder for Cui's printed critical reviews. This attitude changed slightly when Rubinstein left the Saint Petersburg musical scene in 1867. In 1869 Tchaikovsky entered into a <b>working</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>with</b> Balakirev; the result was Tchaikovsky's first recognized masterpiece, the fantasy-overture Romeo and Juliet, a work which The Five wholeheartedly embraced. When Tchaikovsky wrote a positive review of Rimsky-Korsakov's Fantasy on Serbian Themes he was welcomed into the circle, despite concerns about the academic nature of his musical background. The finale of his Second Symphony, nicknamed the Little Russian, was also received enthusiastically by the group on its first performance in 1872.|$|E
