40|$|In {{the hard}} disk drive, MR head {{has been widely}} used as the reading transducer. As the area 1 {{recording}} density increases, the transducer dimension must be reduced, and the signal output of the MR head becomes smaller. To maintain the signal level, some improvements to the current MR head {{have to be done}} in the industry. However, the improvements are often constrained by electron migration reliability. Two approaches were found to be effective to improve the MR head signal output. One is the reduction of dummy contact resistance of metallic joints of MR head. The other is optimization of the film thickness and <b>working</b> <b>current.</b> However, no much study on the contact resistance was reported in the past. Recently, the observation by TEM confirmed that the contact resistance was caused by the contamination in the interface. To monitor and improve the contact resistance in the head fabrication process, a macroscopic resistance measurement method was developed to reveal the contact quality instead of TEM. This method shows a good agreement with the direct TEM observation. To select the MR thickness and <b>working</b> <b>current,</b> a new idea to assess output in reliability lifetime scale was proposed. A systematic method was applied to predict the reliability lifetime as well. By this method, we demonstrated the method to obtain the optimal selection of the MR thickness and the <b>working</b> <b>current</b> to gain the output without the reliability loss...|$|E

But {{it is difficult to}} directly measure relative parameters of combined plasma arc for its characteristics of high temperature and high energy density. In this paper, an image collection system was designed with a lens, a neutral filter, an interference filter and a CCD camera. And then, the acquired digital image of diagnostic face of plasma arc was implemented pre-processing such as removing noises, edge extraction, histogram equalization, contrast enhancement, enhancing morphological features. Furthermore, based on spectral diagnostics of plasma arc, the effects of <b>working</b> <b>current,</b> gas flow and the distance from the nozzle outlet to the anode on temperature distribution of combined plasma arc were also investigated. The results show that the temperature of combined plasma arc is much dependent on the <b>working</b> <b>current,</b> while is less sensitive to the argon flow rate and the distance from the nozzle outlet to the workpiece anode...|$|E

40|$|The zinc/bromine {{flow battery}} is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most suitable candidates for the large-scale electrical energy storage attributed to its nature of high energy density and low cost However, the relatively low power density determined by the <b>working</b> <b>current</b> density of 20 mA cm(- 2) limits its performance and application. The relatively low <b>working</b> <b>current</b> density is caused by the insufficient electrochemical activity of positive electrode and the high internal resistance of cell. The formation of Brads is the rate-determined step to the positive electrode reaction. Thus the activated carbon with the specific surface area of 2314 m(2) g(- 1), compared with the carbon felt, is a much more suitable and competitive choice. The activated carbon coated membrane is first designed to decrease the internal resistance. Demonstrated by the cycle voltammetry, AC impedance and polarization distribution investigations, both the positive electrode overpotential and the cell internal resistance decrease obviously attributed to the high electrochemical activity layer closing to the membrane. Thus the energy efficiency of 75 % is achieved at charge-discharge current density of 40 mA cm(- 2), which means a nearly two-fold increase in power density. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Abstract: A {{three-dimensional}} axisymmetric mathematical model, {{including the}} influence of the swirl exiting in the plasma torch, was developed to describe the heat transfer and fluid flow within a combined plasma arc. In the model, a mapping method and a meshing method of variable step-size were adopted to mesh the calculation domain and to improve the results precision. To overcome a problem from a coexistence of non-transferred arc and transfer arc and a complicated interaction between electric, magnetic, heat flow and fluid flow phenomena in the combined plasma arc, a sequential coupling method and a physical environment approach were introduced into the finite element analysis on jet characteristics of the combined plasma arc. Furthermore, the jet characteristics of combined plasma arc such as temperature, velocity, current density and electromagnetic force were studied; the effects of <b>working</b> <b>current,</b> gas flow and the distance from the nozzle outlet to the anode on the distributions of temperature, velocity and current density were also revealed. Compared with the collection and diagnosis on the combined plasma arc by CCD, the results show that the simulated value appears to be in good agreement with measured value, and the temperature of combined plasma arc is much dependent on the <b>working</b> <b>current,</b> while is less sensitive to the argon flow rate and the distance from the nozzle outlet to the workpiece anode...|$|E
