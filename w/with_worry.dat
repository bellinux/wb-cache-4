25|$|Henrietta Maria {{spent the}} autumn and winter of 1643 in Oxford with Charles, where she attempted, {{as best she}} could, to {{maintain}} the pleasant court life that they had enjoyed before the war. The Queen lived in the Warden's lodgings in Merton College, adorned with the royal furniture which had been brought up from London. The Queen's usual companions were present: Denbigh, Davenant, her dwarves; her rooms were overrun by dogs, including Mitte. The atmosphere in Oxford {{was a combination of}} a fortified city and a royal court, and Henrietta Maria was frequently stressed <b>with</b> <b>worry.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{police officer}} testified {{that as the}} first {{responder}} to the fire scene {{in the early morning}} of October 24, he had found Kate Farrar to be [...] "very frantic" [...] <b>with</b> <b>worry</b> over her siblings, but that Debora Green had showed little, if any, emotion or concern. The defense argued that the psychiatric medications Green had been taking since her September hospitalization could cause blunted affect, which could have led police and fire personnel to erroneously report that Green had been unemotional.|$|E

500|$|He {{continued}} to report upon various battles and the worsening military conditions and praised Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders, despite past tensions with the Commissioner. [...] In early July, Crane {{was sent to}} the United States for medical treatment for a high fever. [...] He was diagnosed with yellow fever, then malaria. [...] Upon arrival in Old Point Comfort, Virginia, he spent a few weeks resting in a hotel. [...] Although Crane had filed more than twenty dispatches in the three months he had covered the war, the Worlds business manager believed that the paper had not received its money's worth and fired him. [...] In retaliation, Crane signed with Hearst's New York Journal with the wish to return to Cuba. [...] He traveled first to Puerto Rico and then to Havana. [...] In September, rumors began to spread that Crane, who was working anonymously, had either been killed or disappeared. [...] He sporadically sent out dispatches and stories; he wrote about the mood in Havana, the crowded city sidewalks, and other topics, but he was soon desperate for money again. [...] Taylor, left alone in England, was also penniless. [...] She became frantic <b>with</b> <b>worry</b> over her lover's whereabouts; they were not in direct communication {{until the end of the}} year. [...] Crane left Havana and arrived in England on January 11, 1899.|$|E
2500|$|Yet, upon {{arriving}} on the Groves, the King was suddenly overcome <b>with</b> <b>worry</b> and doubt. The hairs {{on his body}} even stood up as he felt an agonizing fear. He asked his physician nervously and suspiciously, [...] "Are you not deceiving me, Jivaka? Do you not betray me and hand my life to the enemies? How come it happens {{that there is not}} a single sound heard at all, not even coughs or sneezes in the huge group of 1,250 Sangha monks?" ...|$|E

40|$|Sixty-eight {{undergraduate}} students were randomly allocated {{to one of}} four task conditions and required {{to worry about a}} topic of importance to them while simultaneously performing the task to which they had been allocated. The tasks differed in their ability to interfere <b>with</b> <b>worrying.</b> Generation of random letters was the only task to interfere significantly with the ability to worry. There was a nonsignificant tendency for articulatory suppression to produce some interference <b>with</b> <b>worrying</b> while visuo-spatial tasks did not affect the ability to worry. There was no difference in results between self-reported worriers and non-worriers. The results seem to indicate that worry primarily utilises the phonological aspect of the central executive of working memory...|$|R
2500|$|According to author Hilary Kingsley, {{the scenes}} in EastEnders early years that showed toddler Vicki [...] "chattering happily" [...] with the baby actor who played her uncle Martin (Jon Peyton Price) were viewer favourites. EastEnders was criticised in 1993 for {{featuring}} a storyline about child abduction at an inappropriate time. In the storyline, 6-year old Vicki was abducted, leaving Michelle frantic <b>with</b> <b>worry.</b> In what {{has been described as}} a [...] "coincidence of ill-timing," [...] the storyline was screened at the same time as the real-life abduction and murder of 2-year-old James Bulger. The BBC was forced to transmit a health warning prior to the airing of the episodes, announcing that the storyline would be [...] "resolved positively." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 1919, Isopescu-Grecul noted <b>with</b> <b>worry</b> {{that the}} Hungarians were losing {{interest}} in forming a league with Romania, and were instead pondering a personal {{union with the}} Kingdom of Yugoslavia, under Alexander Karađorđević. In August, as that project came to a halt, he expressed his support for a customs union and [...] "tight alliance" [...] between Hungary and Romania, arguing that the two countries formed an [...] "economic whole". Hungarian diplomatic records of the time also suggest that Isopescu-Grecul vetoed Romania's alliance with Czechoslovakia and Austria against a restored Hungarian Kingdom, because [...] "Rumania prefers a conservative rather than a socialist government in her rear." [...] He also agreed to allow Hungary to rearm herself and join the Allied cause against Bolshevist Russia, and promised to help restore communications between Hungary and Transylvania.|$|E
2500|$|PV2 Frank [...] "Dim" [...] Dumphy (Luke Macfarlane) — [...] {{in spite}} of (or, more likely, in {{reaction}} against) his well-to-do upbringing and Ivy League education, this 22-year-old Cornell graduate deliberately chose a blue-collar, lower-class lifestyle. He was tormented by intellectual conflicts over the actions he is ordered to carry out, and maddened <b>with</b> <b>worry</b> over his pregnant, alcoholic wife and emotionally disturbed 7-year-old stepson. He has never pursued a commission {{because he does not}} want to adopt a leadership role. [...] His perspective serves as a contrast to emphasize the truly underprivileged roots of his squad mates. Probably the most sensitive character in the series, he was deeply disturbed when he learned that a particular insurgent sacrificed several men and a little girl in order to get past a check point. He lacked a degree of street smarts which [...] "Smoke" [...] possessed as he has shown on some occasions, and does not operate prudently under pressure. It is unclear as to why he is a Private when his B.S. gives him an automatic promotion to Specialist. He carries an M4 carbine like his squad-mates, although his is fitted with an M203 grenade launcher.|$|E
