These include dogs, cats, and a few species of birds such as the carrion crow, Eurasian jays and food-storing magpies. [...] Dogs are able to reach a level of object permanence that allows them to find food after it has been hidden beneath one of two cups and rotated 90°. [...] Similarly, cats are able to understand object permanence but not to the same extent that dogs can. Cats fail to understand that if they see something go into an apparatus in one direction that it <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> if the cat tries to enter from another direction. However, while cats {{did not seem to be}} quite as good at this ‘invisible displacement test’ as dogs are, it’s hard to say whether their poorer performance is a true reflection of their abilities or just due to the way in which they’ve been tested. A longitudinal study found that carrion crows' ability developed gradually, albeit with slight changes in the order of mastery compared to human infants. There was only one task, task 15, that the crows were not able to master. The crows showed perseverative searches at a previously rewarded location (the so-called ‘A-not-B error’). They mastered visible rotational displacements consistently, but failed at more complex invisible rotational displacements. [...] Another study tested the comparison of how long it took food-storing magpies to develop the object permanence necessary for them to be able to live independently. [...] The research suggests that these magpies followed a very similar pattern as human infants while they were developing.|$|E

The Court first noted that the courts of appeals had unanimously rejected this argument. It asserted that all warrants are in a sense [...] "anticipatory," [...] because any search is only reasonable if there is probable cause for it when the search is conducted. [...] "In the typical case where the police seek permission to search a house for an item they believe is already located there, the magistrate's determination that there is probable cause for the search amounts to a prediction that the item <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> when the warrant is executed."

6000|$|I {{have taken}} {{but this one}} text or label, out of a hundred such, the matter of labour and liberty; and thought it worth while to trace it from one blatant and bewildering yellow poster in the London streets to its high places in history. But it is only {{one example of the}} way in which a {{thousand}} things grouped themselves and fell into perspective as I passed farther and farther from them, and drew near the central origins of civilisation. I do not say that I saw the solution; but I saw the problem. In the litter of journalism and the chatter of politics, it is too much of a puzzle even to be a problem. For instance, a friend of mine described his book, The Path to Rome, as a journey through all Europe that the Faith had saved; and I might very well describe my own journey as one through all Europe that the War has saved. The trail of the actual fighting, of course, was awfully apparent everywhere; the plantations of pale crosses seemed to crop up on every side like growing things; and the first French villages through which I passed had heard in the distance, day and night, the guns of the long battle-line, like the breaking of an endless exterior sea of night upon the very borderland of the world. I felt it most as we passed the noble towers of Amiens, so near the high-water mark of the high tide of barbarism, in that night of terror just before the turning of the tide. For the truth which thus grew clearer with travel is rightly represented by the metaphor of the artillery, as the thunder and surf of a sea beyond the world. Whatever else the war was, it was like the resistance of something as solid as land, and sometimes as patient and inert as land, against something as unstable as water, as weak as water; but also as strong as water, as strong as water is in a cataract or a flood. It was the resistance of form to formlessness; that version or vision of it seemed to clarify itself more and more as I went on. It was the defence of that same ancient enclosure in which stood the broken columns of the Roman forum and the column in the Paris square, and of all other such enclosures down to the domestic enclosures of my own dog and donkey. All had the same design, the marking out of a square for the experiment of liberty; of the old civic liberty or the later universal liberty. I knew, to take the domestic metaphor, that the watchdog of the West had again proved too strong for the wild dogs of the Orient. For the foes of such creative limits are chaos and old night, whether they are the Northern barbarism that pitted tribal pride and brutal drill against the civic ideal of Paris, or the Eastern barbarism that brought brigands out of the wilds of Asia to sit on the throne of Byzantium. And as in the other case, what I saw was something simpler and larger than all the disputed details about the war and the peace. A man may think it extraordinary, as I do, that the natural dissolution of the artificial German Empire into smaller states should have actually been prevented by its enemies, when it was already accepted in despair by its friends. For we are now trying hard to hold the Prussian system together, having hammered hard for four mortal years to burst it asunder. Or he may think exactly the opposite; it makes no difference to the larger fact I have in mind. A man may think it simply topsy-turvy, as I do, that we should clear the Turks out of Turkey, but leave them in Constantinople. For that is driving the barbarians from their own rude tillage and pasturage, and giving up to them our own European and Christian city; it is as if the Romans annexed Parthia but surrendered Rome. But he may think exactly the opposite; and the larger and simpler truth <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>there.</b> It was that the weeds and wild things had been everywhere breaking into our boundaries, climbing over the northern wall or crawling through the eastern gate, so that the city would soon have been swallowed in the jungle. And whether the lines had been redrawn logically or loosely, or particular things cleared with consistency or caprice, a line has been drawn somewhere and a clearance has been made somehow. The ancient plan of our city has been saved; a city at least capable of containing citizens. I felt this in the chance relics of the war itself; I felt it twenty times more in those older relics which even the war had never touched at all; I felt the change as much in the changeless East as in the ever-changing West. I felt it when I crossed another great square in Paris to look at a certain statue, which I had last seen hung with crape and such garlands as we give the dead; but on whose plain pedestal nothing now is left but the single word [...] "Strasbourg." [...] I felt it when I saw words merely scribbled with a pencil on a wall in a poor street in Brindisi; Italia vittoriosa. But I felt it as much or even more in things infinitely more ancient and remote; in those monuments like mountains that still seem to look down upon all modern things. For these things were more than a trophy that had been raised, they were a palladium that had been rescued. These were the things that had again been saved from chaos, as they were saved at Salamis and Lepanto; and I knew what had saved them or at least in what formation they had been saved. I knew that these scattered splendours of antiquity would hardly have descended to us at all, to be endangered or delivered, if all that pagan world had not crystallised into Christendom.|$|E

And O, that they who read my lines Would ponder soberly, And lay to heart such things betimes As touch eternity. 3. The sleepy sinner little thinks What sorrows will abound Within him, when upon the brinks Of Tophet he is found. 4. Hell is beyond all though a state So doubtful[10] and forlorn, So fearful, that none can relate The pangs {{that there are}} born. 5. God will exclude them utterly From his most blessed face, And them involve in misery, In shame, and in disgrace. 6. God is the {{fountain}} of all bliss, Of life, of light, and peace; They then must needs be comfortless Who are depriv'd of these. 7. Instead of life, a living death Will there in all be found. Dyings will be in every breath, Thus sorrow will abound. 8. No light, but darkness here doth dwell; No peace, but horror strange: The fearful damning wights[11] of hell In all will make this change. 9. To many things the damned's woe Is liked in the word, And that because no one can show The vengeance of the Lord. 10. Unto a dreadful burning lake, All on a fiery flame, Hell is compared, for to make All understand the same. 11. A burning lake, a furnace hot, A burning oven, too, Must be the portion, share, and lot, Of those which evil sow. 12. This plainly shows the burning heat With which it will oppress All hearts, and will like burnings eat Their souls with sore distress. 13. This burning lake, it is God's wrath Incensed by the sin Of those who do reject his path, And wicked ways walk in. 14. Which wrath will so perplex all parts Of body and of soul, As if up to the very hearts In burnings they did roll. 15. Again, to show the stinking state Of this so sad a case, Like burning brimstone God doth make The hidings of his face. 16. And truly as the steam, and smoke, And flames of brimstone smell, To blind the eyes, and stomach choke, So are the pangs of hell. 17. To see a sea of brimstone burn, Who would it not affright? But they whom God to hell doth turn Are in most woful plight. 18. This burning cannot quenched be, No, not with tears of blood; No mournful groans in misery Will here do any good. 19. O damned men! this is your fate, The day of grace is done, Repentance now doth come too late, Mercy is fled and gone. 20. Your groans and cries they sooner should Have sounded in mine ears, If grace you would have had, or would Have me regard your tears. 21. Me you offended with your sin, Instructions you did slight, Your sins against my law hath been, Justice shall have his right. 22. I gave my Son to do you good, I gave you space and time With him to close, which you withstood, And did with hell combine. 23. Justice against you now is set, Which you cannot appease; Eternal justice doth you let From either life or ease. 24. Thus he that to this place doth come May groan, and sigh, and weep; But sin hath made that place his home, And there it will him keep. 25. Wherefore, hell in another place Is call'd a prison too, And all to show the evil case Of all sin doth undo. 26. Which prison, with its locks and bars Of God's lasting decree, Will hold them fast; O how this mars All thought of being free! 27. Out at these brazen bars they may The saints in glory see; But this will not their grief allay, But to them torment be. 28. Thus they in this infernal cave Will now be holden fast From heavenly freedom, though they crave, Of it they may not taste. 29. The chains that darkness on them hangs Still ratt'ling in their ears, Creates within them heavy pangs, And still augments their fears. 30. Thus hopeless of all remedy, They dyingly do sink Into the jaws of misery, And seas of sorrow drink. 31. For being cop'd[12] on every side With helplessness and grief, Headlong into despair they slide Bereft of all relief. 32. Therefore this hell is called a pit, Prepared for those that die The second death, a term most fit To show their misery. 33. A pit that's bottomless is this, A gulf of grief and woe, A dungeon which they cannot miss, That will themselves undo. 34. Thus without stay they always sink, Thus fainting still they fail, Despair they up like water drink, These prisoners have no bail. 35. Here meets them now that worm that gnaws, And plucks their bowels out, The pit, too, on them shuts her jaws; This dreadful is, no doubt. 36. This ghastly worm is guilt for sin, Which on the conscience feeds, With vipers' teeth, both sharp and keen, Whereat it sorely bleeds. 37. This worm is fed by memory, Which strictly brings to mind, All things done in prosperity, As we in Scripture find. 38. No word, nor thought, nor act they did, But now is set in sight, Not one of them can now be hid, Memory gives them light. 39. On which the understanding still Will judge, and sentence pass, This kills the mind, and wounds the will, Alas, alas, alas! 40. O, conscience is the slaughter shop, There hangs the axe and knife, 'Tis there the worm makes all things hot, And wearies out the life. 41. Here, then, is execution done On body and on soul; For conscience will be brib'd of none, But gives to all their dole. 42. This worm, 'tis said, shall never die, But in the belly be Of all that in the flames shall lie, O dreadful sight to see! 43. This worm now needs must in them live, For sin <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>there,</b> And guilt, for God will not forgive, Nor Christ their burden bear. 44. But take from them all help and stay, And leave them to despair, Which feeds upon them night and day, This is the damned's share. 45. Now will confusion so possess These monuments of ire, And so confound them with distress, And trouble their desire. 46. That what to think, or what to do, Or where to lay their head, They know not; 'tis the damned's woe To live, and yet be dead. 47. These cast-aways would fain have life, But know, they never shall, They would forget their dreadful plight, But that sticks fast'st of all. 48. God, Christ, and heaven, they know are best, Yet dare not on them think, The saints they know in joys do rest, While they their tears do drink. 49. They cry alas, but all in vain, They stick fast in the mire, They would be rid of present pain, Yet set themselves on fire. 50. Darkness is their perplexity, Yet do they hate the light, They always see their misery, Yet are themselves all night. 51. They are all dead, yet live they do, Yet neither live nor die. They die to weal, and live to woe, This is their misery. 52. Amidst all this so great a scare That here I do relate, Another falleth to their share In this their sad estate. 53. The legions of infernal fiends Then with them needs must be, A just reward for all their pains, This they shall feel and see. 54. With yellings, howlings, shrieks, and cries, And other doleful noise, With trembling hearts and failing eyes, These are their hellish joys. 55. These angels black they would obey, And serve with greedy mind, And take delight to go astray, That pleasure they might find. 56. Which pleasure now like poison turns Their joy to heaviness; Yea, like the gall of asps it burns, And doth them sore oppress 57. Now is the joy they lived in All turned to brinish tears, And resolute attempts to sin Turn'd into hellish fears. 58. The floods run trickling down their face, Their hearts do prick and ache, While they lament their woful case, Their loins totter and shake. 59. O wetted cheeks, with bleared eyes, How fully do you show The pangs that in their bosom lies, And grief they undergo! 60. Their dolour in their bitterness So greatly they bemoan, That hell itself this to express Doth echo with their groan. 61. Thus broiling on the burning grates, They now to wailing go, And say of those unhappy fates That did them thus undo. 62. Alas, my grief! hard hap had I Those dolours here to find, A living death, in hell I lie, Involv'd with grief of mind. 63. I once was fair for light and grace, My days were long and good; I lived in a blessed place Where was most heav'nly food. 64. But wretch I am, I slighted life, I chose in death to live; O, for these days now, if I might, Ten thousand worlds would give. 65. What time had I to pray and read, What time to hear the word! What means to help me at my need, Did God to me afford! 66. Examples, too, of piety I every day did see, But they abuse and slight did I, O, woe be unto me. 67. I now remember how my friend Reproved me of vice, And bid me mind my latter end, Both once, and twice, and thrice. 68. But O, deluded man, I did My back upon him turn; Eternal life I did not heed, For which I now do mourn. 69. Ah, golden time, I did thee spend In sin and idleness, Ah, health and wealth, I did you lend To bring me to distress. 70. My feet to evil I let run, And tongue of folly talk; My eyes to vanity hath gone, Thus did I vainly walk. 71. I did as greatly toil and strain Myself with sin to please, As if that everlasting grain Could {{have been found in}} these. 72. But nothing, nothing have I found But weeping, and alas, And sorrow, which doth now surround Me, and augment my cross. 73. Ah, bleeding conscience, how did I Thee check when thou didst tell Me of my faults, for which I lie Dead while I live in hell. 74. I took thee for some peevish foe, When thou didst me accuse, Therefore I did thee buffet so, And counsel did refuse. 75. Thou often didst me tidings bring, How God did me dislike, Because I took delight in sin, But I thy news did slight. 76. Ah, Mind, why didst thou do those things That now do work my woe? Ah, Will, why was thou thus inclin'd Me ever to undo? 77. My senses, how were you beguil'd When you said sin was good? It hath in all parts me defil'd, And drown'd me like a flood. 78. Ah, that I now a being have, In sorrow and in pain; Mother, would you had been my grave, But this I wish in vain. 79. Had I been made a cockatrice, A toad, or such-like thing;[13] Yea, had I been made snow or ice, Then had I had no sin; 80. A block, a stock, a stone, or clot, Is happier than I; For they know neither cold nor hot, To live nor yet to die. 81. I envy now the happiness Of those that are in light, I hate the very name of bliss, 'Cause I have there no right. 82. I grieve to see that others are In glory, life, and well, Without all fear, or dread, or care, While I am racked in hell. 83. Thus will these souls with watery eyes, And hacking of their teeth, With wringing hands, and fearful cries, Expostulate their grief. 84. O set their teeth they will, and gnash, And gnaw for very pain, While as with scorpions God doth lash Them for their life so vain. 85. Again, still as they in this muse, Are feeding on the fire, To mind there comes yet other news, To screw their torments higher. 86. Which is the length of this estate, Where they at present lie; Which in a word I thus relate, 'Tis to eternity. 87. This thought now is so firmly fix'd In all that comes to mind, And also is so strongly mix'd With wrath of every kind. 88. So that whatever they do know, Or see, or think, or feel, For ever still doth strike them through As with a bar of steel. 89. For EVER shineth in the fire, EVER is on the chains; 'Tis also in the pit of ire, And tastes in all their pains. 90. For ever separate from God, From peace, and life, and rest; For ever underneath the rod That vengeance liketh best. 91. O ever, ever, this will drown'd Them quite and make them cry, We never shall get o'er thy bound, O, great eternity! 92. They sooner now the stars may count Than lose these dismal bands; Or see to what the motes[14] among Or number up the sands. 93. Then see an end of this their woe, Which now for sin they have; O wantons, take heed what you do, Sin will you never save. 94. They sooner may drink up the sea, Than shake off these their fears; Or make another in one day As big with brinish tears; 95. Than put an end to misery, In which they now do roar, Or help themselves; no, they must cry, Alas, for evermore. 96. When years by thousands on a heap Are passed o'er their head; Yet still the fruits of sin they reap Among the ghostly dead. 97. Yea, when they have time out of mind Be in this case so ill, For EVER, EVER is behind[15] Yet for them to fulfill.|$|E

50|$|The most {{striking}} difference between JADE and other object-oriented programming languages {{is that its}} object database is a native part of its language. For example, when creating an object in JADE, it can be created as transient or persistent. Creating an object as transient is similar to creating objects in other object-oriented programming languages - the object is simply created in memory, and then lost when the program ends. On the other hand, when an object is created as persistent, when the program ends, the object <b>will</b> <b>still</b> exist and <b>be</b> <b>there</b> {{the next time the}} program starts up. So, when an object is persistent JADE automatically works in the background to store and retrieve the object in the database when necessary. Persistent objects can be distributed across multiple co-operating servers, with JADE automatically handling object caching and cache coherency.|$|R

During this meeting, Jareth seems disappointed that Sarah has made so little of herself but notices that her strong <b>will</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>there.</b> It <b>is</b> also shown that Sarah has no memory of ever knowing Jareth, though why this is not revealed. After leaving Sarah, Jareth seeks and finds a specific goblin, Cob, who had been banished to the human world many years earlier. From him, he retrieves a tiny sliver of his own heart, which he had splintered off for safekeeping before his power began to wane; it is as potent as ever. With {{a good portion of}} his magic restored, Jareth plots his revenge on Sarah. He creates the Enigma Lain theater in an outdoor park and sends Sarah a ticket.|$|R

It is right that it should be found, and that the property should go to those to whom Mr. Penfold left it, and who are now being kept out of it by the Miss Penfolds. I am very much interested in the matter, because it is my son who is being cheated out of his rights; and I have made up my mind to find the will.

5000|$|In Kiev, Ukraine and {{probably}} other places marshrutkas evolve into [...] "everybody pays" [...] fast going buses. The vehicles can be small, medium-sized, and sometimes big buses, {{with a higher}} fare than on ordinary municipally funded buses, and the main thing about marshrutkas is they don't carry pensionaries and the disabled, and depending on the particular city, students, law enforcement workers, and civil servants (pass holders) for free. [...] Marshrutkas will not take more free passengers (invalids) then strictly limited quantity of one per marshrutka, while in ordinary buses, trolley buses and trams quantity of them is not limited and more categories of people (pensionaries etc.) have right to ride for free. And {{this is the reason}} why <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many times more marshrutkas in the city than ordinary buses, trolley buses and trams altogether. Since municipally funded buses must transport pass holders for free, naturally pass holders tend to use a municipal bus vs a private bus. The word [...] "taxi" [...] is needed just to answer the question why they have no free-ride obligations as part of their franchise, as ordinary municipal buses, which are usually [...] "full of free riders", are unprofitable and bring economical loss. A marshrut may even charge the same fare as a municipal bus in the city, but marshrut <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> profitable since <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an effective doubling of the price due to there being 1 or no free pass riders on board. Interesting fact: in the 1990s when local authorities temporarily lost their ability to finance city bus work, the bus drivers just installed in their buses windows tablets with inscription [...] "Taxomotor" [...] and that just meant that every passenger has to pay the fare.|$|R
50|$|As stated above, a time {{traveler}} cannot {{return to}} a temporal location he has previously visited (even {{if it were to}} a different physical location), since technically he <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> and thus create a paradox. This plays a role in the endgame when Stefan witnesses Laura's death at the hands of SS Lt. Erich Kleitmann's men. Since he is already there when she dies, he cannot return there to save her, so instead he returns to 1944 and sends a message in a bottle forward to just before the event, warning of the outcome. Stefan has to be careful to use items from the past to compose the message, otherwise they would not appear when needed.|$|E
