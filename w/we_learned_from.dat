25|$|You speak truly, O Achilli, and {{we cannot}} answer you a word. You are a Priest; {{you have been}} a Friar; you are, it is undeniable, the scandal of Catholicism, and the palmary {{argument}} of Protestants, by your extraordinary depravity. You have been, it is true, a profligate, an unbeliever, and a hypocrite. Not many years passed of your conventional life, and you were never in the choir, always in private houses, so that the laity observed you. You were deprived of your professorship, we own it; you were prohibited from preaching and hearing confessions; you were obliged to give hush-money to the father of one of your victims, as <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> an official document of the Neapolitan Police to be 'known for habitual incontinency;' your name came before the civil tribunal at Corfu for your crime of adultery. You have put the crown on your offences, by as long as you could, denying them all; you have professed to seek after truth, when you were ravening after sin.|$|E

"What other man, while Sparta {{still had}} the {{superior}} strength and the Spartan Eurybiades held the supreme command of the fleet, could by his single-handed efforts have deprived Sparta of that glory? Of what other man have <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> history that by a single act he caused himself to surpass all the commanders, his city all the other Greek states, and the Greeks the barbarians? In whose term as general have the resources been more inferior and the dangers they faced greater?

500|$|The game uses an {{optimized}} {{version of}} the Dinosaur Hunter engine, which allowed developers to create environments with more complex geometry and incorporate a lighting system where light sources could cast shadows on objects in real-time. The game's distance fog was reduced and disguised as an atmospheric effect, resulting in players {{being able to see}} five time as far than they could in the original game. The game's progression, focus on exploration and mission objectives were inspired by the Mario and Zelda franchises. As Dienstbier explained, [...] "That's something that <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> Miyamoto: Start things off simple and gradually add to it as you progress. Later objectives will make far more use of the dynamic environments." [...] Unlike the original game, where levels shared graphic assets, Seeds of Evil features unique levels with different geometry, textures and enemies.|$|E

2500|$|In 1955, Wilson {{acknowledged}} AA's debt, saying [...] "The Oxford Groupers {{had clearly}} shown {{us what to}} do. And just as importantly, <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> them what not to do." [...] Among the Oxford Group practices that AA retained were informal gatherings, a [...] "changed-life" [...] developed through [...] "stages", and working with others for no material gain, AA's analogs for these are meetings, [...] "the steps", and sponsorship. AA's tradition of anonymity was {{a reaction to the}} publicity-seeking practices of the Oxford Group, as well as AA's wish to not promote, Wilson said, [...] "erratic public characters who through broken anonymity might get drunk and destroy confidence in us." ...|$|E
