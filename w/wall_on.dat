5|$|Growth {{was much}} slower in the east, and the modest {{extensions}} {{on this side}} were separated from the much larger extensions in the west by the marshy open area of Moorfields adjacent to the <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> the north side which discouraged development in that direction.|$|E
5|$|In {{relation}} to the structure itself, the inner city is notable for the audience hall, which is an important representation of Serbian medieval architecture. High in the stone <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> the Danube side, four sets of double-arched windows are carved in a combination of Gothic and Romanesque styles. This is where a merchant contract between the Republic of Venice and the Serbian Despotate was signed.|$|E
5|$|Sinclair, Norton, Stirling and Cally {{escape to}} a fallout shelter {{entrance}} on horseback. They locate an underground {{facility in the}} forest and find an intact 2007 Bentley Continental GT, which they fuel up. Kane's medieval knights arrive and kill Norton. Sinclair and the others drive the Bentley back to the quarantine <b>wall.</b> <b>On</b> the way, they are intercepted by Sol's gang, who seeks to avenge Viper's death. After a high-speed chase, Sol {{and many of his}} men are killed and Sinclair's group escape.|$|E

5|$|The 21st did {{not reach}} the stone <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> Marye's Heights but took shelter in a very slight {{depression}} in the terrain, remaining pinned in that position until night. Under the cover of darkness, the regiment retired, only to be ordered to the same spot the next morning, expecting a Confederate counterattack which never came. The regiment lost {{a third of its}} numbers at Frederickburg.|$|E
5|$|The British {{attacked}} {{the position of}} the 3rd Continentals, and an engagement ensued. Both sides kept up constant fire, the Americans breaking the British lines several times. However, after 17 volleys, the British numbers began to overwhelm the Americans, and Glover ordered a withdrawal to another stone <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> the crest of a hill while the next regiment in line, the 26th Continentals, engaged the British.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> the sea-facing side of Dubrovnik {{stretches}} from Fort Bokar {{in the west}} to St. John Fortress in the south, and to the Revelin Fortress on the land-side. These walls are 1.5 to 5 meters (5–16feet) thick, depending on their location and its strategic importance. The purpose of these walls were to help defend the city from sea-based attacks, particularly from the Republic of Venice, which was often considered a threat to Dubrovnik's safety.|$|E

5|$|The {{most famous}} {{project of the}} Mycenaean era was the network of roads in the Peloponnese. This appears to have {{facilitated}} the speedy deployment of troops—for example, {{the remnants of a}} Mycenaean road, along with what {{appears to have been a}} Mycenaean defensive <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> the Isthmus of Corinth. The Mycenaean era saw the zenith of infrastructure engineering in Greece, and this appears not to have been limited to the Argive plain.|$|E
5|$|The new plaza {{created in}} 1967 {{is used for}} worship and public gatherings, {{including}} Bar mitzvah celebrations and the swearing-in ceremonies of newly full-fledged soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces. Tens of thousands of Jews flock to the <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> the Jewish holidays, and particularly on the fast of Tisha B'Av, which marks {{the destruction of the}} Temple and on Jerusalem Day, which commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 and the delivery of the Wall into Jewish hands.|$|E
5|$|The present {{building}} is designed on a triangular plan. The large tower {{at the tip}} of the triangle is the medieval gatehouse, from which wings extend on either side. An isolated tower that now has the library on two floors divides the curtain <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> the east.|$|E

5|$|The south transept, {{formerly}} the parish church of StOswald contains a piscina and sedilia {{in the south}} <b>wall.</b> <b>On</b> the east wall are four chapels, each with a reredos, two of which were designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, one by Kempe and the other by his successor, W.E.Tower. The south window is dated 1887 and was made by Heaton, Butler and Bayne to a design by R.C.Hussey. Other stained glass in the transept is by Clayton and Bell, by C.E.Kempe and by Powell.|$|E
5|$|The stadium was in poor repair {{towards the}} end of its life and, shortly after the club moved out to Old Trafford, the main stand at Bank Street blew down in a storm. The site is now {{occupied}} by the car park of the Manchester Velodrome, with a plaque on a house <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> Bank Street indicating the presence of the former ground. The site is close to the City of Manchester Stadium, the home of Manchester City Football Club.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{is built}} into the rear <b>wall,</b> <b>on</b> the forts southern side. This room is set into the end of the rampart and was used to prepare gunpowder charges. A guardhouse was built at the manning parade's southern end in 1885. It is now used as a duty room for the drill squad during recreation demonstrations but originally was a guard's room and separate cells connected by telephone to Fort Largs. Up to three men appear to have been accommodated in the guard's room. When the fort was converted to use as a caravan park the guard house was converted to an ablution block. A store and ablution block were also built in 1885 between the stockade and rear defence wall.|$|E

5|$|Ida's major craters {{are named}} after caves and lava tubes on Earth. The crater Azzurra, for example, {{is named after}} a {{submerged}} cave {{on the island of}} Capri, also known as the Blue Grotto. Azzurra seems to be the most recent major impact on Ida. The ejecta from this collision is distributed discontinuously over Ida and is responsible for the large-scale color and albedo variations across its surface. An exception to the crater morphology is the fresh, asymmetric Fingal, which has a sharp boundary between the floor and <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> one side. Another significant crater is Afon, which marks Ida's prime meridian.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} two episodes, it is {{revealed}} that Wirt and Greg are actually two boys from the modern era. Wirt and Greg's strange appearance {{stems from the fact}} that the night they entered the Unknown was Halloween. Wirt, attempting to take back an embarrassing poetry tape he made for a girl he likes, had followed her to a graveyard scary story gathering before a police officer scared him and Greg into jumping over the cemetery's garden <b>wall.</b> <b>On</b> the other side of the wall, they landed on train tracks where Greg was almost hit by a train. Wirt pushed them both off a hill into a lake/river in an attempt to save him, knocking them both unconscious in the process and sending them to a Limbo-like realm between life and death.|$|E
5|$|Later, Stottlemeyer and Disher {{watch the}} film's {{shooting}} and Natalie's prediction is right: Ruskin has impersonated Monk {{to the point}} that he is unable to complete the sequence because he is hassled by the setting's disorder. He leaves the studio, goes to Monk's house to know what are his reasons to do his job, and explores Monk's files on Trudy's murder, grieving Monk. An afflicted Monk goes to Natalie's house, where he solves the case when he sees torn paper by Julie to prevent Natalie from reading it. The pawnshop is adjacent to a restaurant, where clients are drawn on the <b>wall.</b> <b>On</b> the crime's night, Leverett and Cullman were sketched and Leverett tried to destroy the evidence.|$|E

5|$|Many {{contemporary}} Orthodox scholars {{rule that}} the area {{in front of the}} Wall has the status of a synagogue and must be treated with due respect. This is the view upheld by the authority in charge of the wall. As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the <b>Wall.</b> <b>On</b> Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of the Sabbath.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, a {{powerful}} squall line of thunderstorms with embedded supercells developed across New York and moved northeast through parts of northern New England and Quebec. Particularly hard hit was the Montreal region and its southern suburbs including Longueuil, Châteauguay, Brossard and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu. Barns were reported damaged and other structures sustained roof and siding damage; {{particularly in the}} Saint-Blaise-sur-Richelieu area where one home was pushed from its foundation. In Sainte-Catherine, the roof of an office was blown into a nearby residence punching a large hole on the back <b>wall.</b> <b>On</b> Montreal's Champlain Bridge, eight tractor trailers were overturned forcing {{the closure of the}} entire bridge in both directions. In addition, a window washing platform tumbled from a high rise building in downtown Montreal. The workers were able to get inside.|$|E
5|$|One of Greer Stadium's most {{distinctive}} features was its guitar-shaped scoreboard. After First Tennessee Park was approved, the team {{announced it would}} not be relocating the original Greer scoreboard, which was technologically outdated and difficult to maintain, to the new stadium. While plans for First Tennessee Park's scoreboard were initially undisclosed, following overwhelming support for Greer's guitar from the community, the team announced plans for a larger, more modern guitar-shaped scoreboard for the new ballpark. The new guitar scoreboard, paid for entirely by the Sounds, was designed by TS Sports in conjunction with Panasonic, and was installed beyond the right-center field <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> the concourse.|$|E
