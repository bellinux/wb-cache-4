500|$|The song [...] "All Hands on the Bad One" [...] {{features}} guitar riffs {{that are}} reminiscent of the band's second album, Call the Doctor. It {{was chosen as the}} title track because, according to guitarist Carrie Brownstein, it is the song that best represents the sentiment of the album. Brownstein explained that the song deals with [...] "your relationship to evil and your relationship to the hypocrisy of forcing a morality on someone else when you yourself are no better." [...] She added, [...] "'Ballad of the Ladyman', for instance—who is 'the ladyman'? Is the person that wants to be on the radio, 'the bad one,' or is it the fans assuming that they [...] <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio—are they 'the bad one'? Or is 'The Professional,' the ominous professional figure, 'the bad one'? I think all these songs can go into that machine of 'the bad one' and that mentality and then be spit out in a bunch of different scenarios. So that's why I think it works as the title." ...|$|E

I am born and bred in the East End [...] it feels like a homecoming." [...] Norwood adapted his own use of slang into the character to [...] "try and bring it and from a true place." [...] Bunmi Mojekwu, who plays Mercy Olubunmi, commented [...] "I feel so blessed to be part of EastEnders: E20. My first day on set was just crazy. I was on Albert Square – a dream come true – I'm enjoying every second." [...] Sam Attwater, who previously appeared in five episodes of Hollyoaks, was cast as boxer Leon Small. On his casting, he commented, [...] "It's a great privilege to be working with such great actors and on such an established show. It's an amazing opportunity and I'm really enjoying tackling a character like Leon who has so much going on," [...] He prepared for the role by attending a gym, as the character has a lot of topless scenes. He said: [...] "As soon as I heard that I was straight down the gym. Lots of crunches. Everyone said don't worry about it, but every time I did one of those scenes I had to watch it back and see how it looked because there will be 10 million people watching it.

500|$|Recording of {{the tracks}} that were to appear on Echo & the Bunnymen began at Conny Plank's studio in Cologne. Both Echo & the Bunnymen and their label, WEA Records, were unhappy {{with the results of}} the Norton {{sessions}} with Palmer playing drums. Keen to record again with de Freitas, the band decided to scrap the Norton sessions and to start recording a new album with Latham who had previously worked with the band on their 1985 single [...] "Bring on the Dancing Horses". The sessions moved from Cologne to ICP Studios in Brussels before returning to Cologne and finishing off at The Workhouse in London and Amazon Studios in Liverpool. The band hoped that the album would be a collection of simple songs; however, Latham was very specific and exacting, and he would work on one song for as long as a month. Recording was also complicated by the star treatment received by McCulloch. This, along with his heavy drinking, alienated him {{from the rest of the}} band. In a 1995 interview, band guitarist Will Sergeant said of McCulloch's treatment, [...] "We just found it all ridiculous. He had people running around behind him, basically wiping his arse." [...] McCulloch later said in a 1997 interview: [...] "I knew I was losing it. I was on another planet but then I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one [...] were on." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{first scene}} Attwater filmed was {{of him in}} his underwear, the first of six semi-naked scenes that were filmed for EastEnders: E20. Attwater said he felt {{pressure}} to be in shape for the part and prepared by attending a gym, saying [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> best form." [...] Leon is also a dedicated boxer, but Attwater had never boxed before. His boxing scenes in EastEnders: E20 were filmed with a stuntman who Attwater was allowed to hit as much as was necessary.|$|E

Hood received an M.D. from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1964 and a Ph.D. from Caltech in 1968, {{where he worked}} with William J. Dreyer on antibody diversity.
