5000|$|The {{selection}} of a <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> {{will depend on the}} application in which it will be used. To select the appropriate <b>sump</b> <b>pump,</b> consider the following: ...|$|R
50|$|Interior French drain {{installation}} {{is an effective}} way to waterproof a basement but requires the use of a <b>sump</b> <b>pump.</b> Many contractors will install plastic <b>sump</b> <b>pumps</b> that can quickly break down or neglect to install a battery backup <b>sump</b> <b>pump,</b> making the basement vulnerable to flooding during power outages. <b>Sump</b> <b>pumps</b> should be installed with a battery backup system in a proper sump liner of 20 gal size or larger to prevent the sump from having too little water and turning on and off continuously.|$|R
5000|$|Automatic vs. manual {{operation}} - Selection of a manual <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> means that one will turn the pump {{on and off}} when appropriate. Selecting an automatic <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> means that a switch is wired to the <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> {{to turn it on}} or off at appropriate water levels. Automatic switches include pressure switches, low level pressure switches, float switches, and a solid state water sensor called field-effect.|$|R

50|$|<b>Sump</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are used}} where {{basement}} flooding happens regularly and to solve dampness {{where the water}} table is above {{the foundation of a}} home. <b>Sump</b> <b>pumps</b> send water away from a house to any place where it is no longer problematic, such as a municipal storm drain or a dry well.|$|R
50|$|Alternative <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> {{systems can}} be driven by {{municipal}} water pressure. Water-powered <b>sump</b> <b>pumps</b> are similar to backup-battery-driven systems with a separate pump, float and check valves. During installation, the float is mounted in the sump pit above the normal high water mark. Under normal conditions, your main electric powered <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> will handle all the pumping duties. When water rises higher than normal for any reason, the backup float in the sump is lifted and activates the backup <b>sump</b> <b>pump.</b> As municipal water rushes through the ejector, it creates a powerful suction force which causes the PVC pipe {{to act like a}} giant soda straw, drawing water up from the sump and ejecting it outdoors. There are no impellers, turbines, motors, or mechanical parts to wear out. There are no batteries, wires, or chargers to monitor, tend to, or replace.|$|R

50|$|Pumps may {{discharge}} to the {{sanitary sewer}} in older installations. Once considered acceptable, this practice may now violate the plumbing code or municipal bylaws, {{because it can}} overwhelm the municipal sewage treatment system. Municipalities urge homeowners to disconnect and reroute <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> discharge away from sanitary sewers. Fines may be imposed for noncompliance. Many homeowners have inherited their <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> configurations and do not realize that the pump discharges into the sewer.|$|R
50|$|Sump basins and <b>sump</b> <b>pumps</b> must be maintained. Typical {{recommendations}} suggest examining equipment every year. Pumps running frequently due {{to higher}} water table, water drainage, or weather conditions {{should be examined}} more frequently. <b>Sump</b> <b>pumps,</b> being mechanical devices, will fail eventually, {{which could lead to}} a flooded basement and costly repairs. Redundancy in the system (multiple/secondary pumps) can help to avoid problems when maintenance and repairs are needed on the primary system.|$|R

5000|$|Lubrication: <b>Wet</b> <b>sump,</b> splash lubrication. A hook, {{attached}} {{onto the}} connecting rod, dips into {{the oil in}} the sump and splashes it around {{the inside of the}} engine.|$|R
50|$|When {{examining}} a <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> and cleaning it, dirt, gravel, sand, and other debris {{should be removed}} to increase efficiency and {{extend the life of}} the pump. These obstructions can also decrease the pump's ability to drain the sump, and can allow the sump to overflow. The check valve can also jam from the debris. Examine the discharge line opening, when applicable, to ensure there are no obstructions in the line. Even a partially obstructed discharge line can force a <b>sump</b> <b>pump</b> to work harder and increase its chance of overheating and failure.|$|R

40|$|This paper covers {{information}} {{research of}} basic design rules of industrial <b>wet</b> <b>sumps.</b> It describes mathematical models of vortices and method for their identification and visualization. Then the author focuses on CFD modeling of surface vortices with single phase and multiphase approach with Volume of Fluid method. Basic principles of multiphase CFD modelling in OpenFOAM and ANSYS Fluent are given. Description and benchmarking of suitable turbulence models is also present. The single phase and multiphase approach were successfully validated {{for a simple}} test case of bathtub surface vortex. Satisfactory agreement with experimental data was achieved. The accuracy and behavior of both solvers were compared between each other. This gives us useful tool for evaluation of inflow condition and danger of surface vortex occurrence in <b>wet</b> <b>sumps.</b> The acquired knowledges were used to design an experimental test case with geometry similar to industrial <b>wet</b> <b>sump.</b> A map of surface vortex occurrence has been created for different operating points. One of the operating point {{has been used for}} numerical simulation (both single phase and multiphase). Partial agreement with experimental observation has been achieved...|$|R
