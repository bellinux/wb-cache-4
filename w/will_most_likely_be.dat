Rolls-Royce Trent engines were again selected for both orders with Trent 900s powering the A380s and Trent 1000s powering the 787s.

5|$|Cavaliers can {{be subject}} to a genetic defect of the femur and knee called luxating patella. This {{condition}} is most often observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old. In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated. The grading system for the patella runs from 1 (a tight knee), to 4 (a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced). If a cavalier has a grade 1–2, physical rehabilitation therapy and exercise may reduce the grading and potentially avoid surgery. The grades 3–4 are most severe where surgery <b>will</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> needed to correct the problem to avoid the development of arthritis and lameness in the limb.|$|E
5|$|Mass {{transfer}} {{came to an}} {{end when}} the surface layers of the mass-losing star were depleted, and the core slowly shrunk to a white dwarf. Now the stars peacefully orbit around each other. The long-term prospects for PSR B1620-26 b are poor, though. The triple system, which is much more massive than a typical isolated star in M4, is slowly drifting down into the core of the cluster, where the density of stars is very high. In a billion years or so, the triple will probably have another close encounter with a nearby star. The most common outcome of such encounters is that the lightest companion is ejected from the multiple star system. If this happens, PSR B1620-26 b <b>will</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> ejected completely from M4, and will spend the rest of its existence wandering alone in interstellar space as an interstellar planet.|$|E

5|$|In October 2009, Mike Ashley {{announced}} {{that he planned to}} lease the name of the ground in a bid to increase revenue, and in November the stadium was temporarily renamed sportsdirect.com @ St James' Park Stadium. This name was only supposed to be used {{until the end of the}} 2009–10 season, but lasted until November 2011. On 10 November 2011, the club officially changed the name of the stadium to the Sports Direct Arena, although this <b>will</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> an interim name, as it is only being used to showcase the sponsorship capabilities of the stadium. The company, owned by Ashley, were not paying anything for the deal. However, if another company purchases the naming rights, they will be expected to pay between £8 million and £10 million. Many fans voiced their anger at the renaming, but Managing Director Derek Llambias has said that it was necessary to give Newcastle extra money so that they compete with the bigger clubs in the league.|$|E

The new show <b>will</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>be</b> introduced during an episode of Grey's Anatomy next season. In July 2017, it was announced that Jaina Lee Ortiz was the first actress cast in the spin-off series. In September 2017 it was announced that Jason George, who has played Dr. Ben Warren since season 6, would be leaving Grey's Anatomy to move to the spin-off. He's expected to be a series regular on Grey's Anatomy until the spin-off begins production. In October 2017 it was announced that five new series regulars for the spin off had been cast being Grey Damon, Jay Hayden, Okieriete Onaodowan, Danielle Savre and Barrett Doss. It was also announced that the spin-off had a 10 episode order for the first season. Later in October 2017, it was announced that Miguel Sandoval was cast as the Captain of the firehouse.|$|E

25|$|As with SOFCs, MCFC {{disadvantages}} include slow start-up {{times because}} of their high operating temperature.

Researchers are addressing this problem by exploring corrosion-resistant materials for components as well as fuel cell designs that may increase cell life without decreasing performance.|$|E
