5|$|There {{are ongoing}} {{programs}} {{working on a}} dengue vaccine to cover all four serotypes. Now {{that there is a}} fifth serotype this <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> factored in. One of the concerns is that a vaccine could increase the risk of severe disease through antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The ideal vaccine is safe, effective after one or two injections, covers all serotypes, does not contribute to ADE, is easily transported and stored, and is both affordable and cost-effective.|$|E

5|$|Also {{exceptionally}} challenging will be {{the movement}} and destruction of deadly agents such as sarin, VX nerve agents and mustard agent during the civil war. The chemical weapons convention disallows movement of such deadly agents outside the country holding them, but Security Council Resolution 2118 allows extraordinary measures {{to be taken in}} Syria. Some of the chemicals <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transported along the highway between Damascus and Homs, which is still contested as of December 2013. Syria has requested the international community provide armored vehicles to assist in safe transport of the chemicals. In February 2014, Syria stated that rebels had attempted to attack two convoys transporting chemical weapons.|$|E
5|$|Incubation takes 56days, and {{the male}} stops {{incubating}} the eggs shortly before they hatch. The temperature of the nest rises slightly during the eight-week period. Although the eggs are laid sequentially, they tend to hatch within two days of one another, as the eggs that were laid later experienced higher temperatures and developed more rapidly. During the process, the precocial emu chicks {{need to develop a}} capacity for thermoregulation. During incubation, the embryos are kept at a constant temperature but the chicks <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to cope with varying external temperatures by the time they hatch.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} {{reacts with}} moisture {{on the skin}} and in the eyes, causing a burning sensation and the immediate forceful and uncontrollable shutting of the eyes. Effects usually include tears streaming from the eyes, profuse coughing, exceptional nasal discharge that is full of mucus, burning in the eyes, eyelids, nose and throat areas, disorientation, dizziness and restricted breathing. It will also burn the skin where sweaty and/or sunburned. In highly concentrated doses it can also induce severe coughing and vomiting. Almost all of the immediate effects wear off within an hour (such as exceptional nasal discharge and profuse coughing), although the feeling of burning and highly irritated skin may persist for hours. Affected clothing <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> washed several times or thrown away.|$|E

30|$|Another {{direction}} of progress can <b>be</b> envisioned thanks <b>to</b> the scale at which microtomography is performed, namely, {{the study of}} the mechanical behavior at the microscale. For the studied material, this would allow the behavior of the ferrite/pearlite matrix <b>to</b> <b>be</b> analyzed in conjunction with the debonding of the interface between the brittle nodules and their surrounding matrix. The same framework as that introduced herein can be used. However, the meshes <b>will</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> significantly finer and adapted to the microstructure [58].|$|R
5|$|The {{similarity}} of these symbionts in the genus Cryptocercus {{to those in}} termites are such that these cockroaches have been suggested to be {{more closely related to}} termites than to other cockroaches, and current research strongly supports this hypothesis about their relationships. All species studied so far carry the obligate mutualistic endosymbiont bacterium Blattabacterium, with the exception of Nocticola australiensise, an Australian cave-dwelling species without eyes, pigment or wings, which recent genetic studies indicate is a very primitive cockroach. It had previously been thought that all five families of cockroach were descended from a common ancestor that was infected with B. cuenoti. It may be that N. australiensise subsequently lost its symbionts, or alternatively this hypothesis <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> re-examined.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} problem that arises at {{the interface between}} wheel and axle (or axle and body) is the limited ability of an organism to transfer materials across this interface. If the tissues {{that make up a}} wheel are living, they <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> supplied with oxygen and nutrients and have wastes removed to sustain metabolism. A typical animal circulatory system, composed of blood vessels, {{would not be able to}} provide transportation across the interface. In the absence of circulation, oxygen and nutrients would need to diffuse across the interface, a process that would be greatly limited by the available partial pressure and surface area, in accordance with Fick's law of diffusion. For large multicellular animals, diffusion would be insufficient. Alternatively, a wheel could be composed of excreted, nonliving material such as keratin, of which hair and nails are composed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} and {{moderate}} stages, modifications to the living environment and lifestyle can increase patient safety and reduce caretaker burden. Examples of such modifications are the adherence to simplified routines, the placing of safety locks, the labelling of household items to cue {{the person with the}} disease or the use of modified daily life objects. If eating becomes problematic, food <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prepared in smaller pieces or even pureed. When swallowing difficulties arise, the use of feeding tubes may be required. In such cases, the medical efficacy and ethics of continuing feeding is an important consideration of the caregivers and family members. The use of physical restraints is rarely indicated in any stage of the disease, although there are situations when they are necessary to prevent harm to the person with AD or their caregivers.|$|E

5|$|Editing began {{later that}} day, {{with the first}} rough cut {{completed}} on March 18. A version was screened on March 30 for Moore, Peter Lauritson, Dan Curry, J. P. Farrell and Dawn Velazquez to better inform the post-production optical effects which were under production at the time. Cast audio re-recording took place from April 9 onwards depending on the individual actor's availability, supervised by Velazquez. Composer Dennis McCarthy first saw a cut of the episode on April 21. He worked with Velazquez and music editor Gerry Sackman to develop some musical cues which could recur throughout the episode as well as working out what type of work <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> completed. For example, although he couldn't see the visual effects {{at the time as}} they were not yet complete, Velazquez explained what they should look like.|$|E
