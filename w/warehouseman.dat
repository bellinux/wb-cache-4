5|$|Alex Wiens (Russian: Алекс Винс, {{also known}} as Alexander Wiens) was born in 1980 in Perm, Russia. After leaving school, he {{completed}} a vocational training programme as a <b>warehouseman.</b> In 1999, after a medical examination for conscription, Wiens was exempted from compulsory military service in the Russian armed forces; it was stated that Wiens probably had suffered from a severe and chronic psychosis. In 2003, he immigrated to Germany and gained German citizenship {{as a result of}} his ethnic origin. In Germany, he worked as a builder and caretaker, but had been living on welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed at the time of the murder. In November 2009, at the time of sentencing, Wiens was 28 years old, unmarried and without children.|$|E
5|$|Four young West Indian men, Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans and Prince Brown, {{formed an}} action group, later {{to be called}} the West Indian Development Council. They were unhappy with the lack of {{progress}} in fighting discrimination by the West Indian Association. Owen Henry had met Paul Stephenson, whose father was from West Africa, and who had been to college. The group decided that the articulate Stephenson would be their spokesman. Stephenson set up a test case to prove the colour bar existed by arranging an interview with the bus company for Guy Bailey, a young <b>warehouseman</b> and Boys' Brigade officer. When Stephenson told the company that Bailey was West Indian, the interview was cancelled. Inspired by the refusal of Rosa Parks to give up her seat on a bus in Alabama and the ensuing Montgomery Bus Boycott in the United States in 1955, the activists decided on a bus boycott in Bristol.|$|E

25|$|Vinea and Tzara met a {{final time}} when the latter came to Romania on an {{official}} visit, in 1947. That year, having resumed friendly contacts with the PNȚ, his work hosted by Nicolae Carandino at Dreptatea, Vinea narrowly escaped arrest during the Tămădău Affair clampdown. The full proclamation of a Romanian communist regime in 1948 drove Vinea into the cultural underground. For a while, he earned a meager living as a ghostwriter, {{but also as a}} <b>warehouseman</b> and porter. In 1949, sculptor Oscar Han briefly employed him as his plasterer. While working for the candlemaker Aliciu, alongside other disgraced wartime journalists, Vinea was periodically harassed by agents of the Securitate, who were reexamining his Evenimentul Zilei material.|$|E
25|$|Andrés Bonifacio was a <b>warehouseman</b> and clerk from Manila. He {{established}} the Katipunan—a revolutionary organization which aimed to gain independence from Spanish colonial rule by armed revolt—on July 7, 1892. Fighters in Cavite province won early victories. One {{of the most}} influential and popular leaders from Cavite was Emilio Aguinaldo, mayor of Cavite El Viejo (modern-day Kawit), who gained control of much of the eastern portion of Cavite province. Eventually, Aguinaldo and his faction gained control of the leadership of the Katipunan movement. Aguinaldo was elected president of the Philippiine revolutionary movement at the Tejeros Convention on March 22, 1897, and Bonifacio was executed for treason by Aguinaldo's supporters after a show trial on May 10, 1897. Aguinaldo is officially considered the first President of the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|In December 2016, Cheryl {{appeared}} on the BBC One genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are?, during which she researched her maternal family. Research shows that her paternal line is from Tyneside {{and that there were}} a number of coal miners amongst Cheryl's forebears. When tracing further back, in one of the branches of her paternal line, researchers find that her ancestry includes several mariners. The investigation into Cheryl's maternal line shows that her grandmother, Olga Ridley, was one of twin girls born to Edith Annie Burton, the housekeeper for a widower named Joseph Ridley who already had a number of children from his marriage. Joseph Ridley had fought in World War I in the Durham Light Infantry as a Pioneer in France and, from an examination of the census, before the war he had been a Grocery <b>Warehouseman.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1852, Edward Barker {{obtained}} a take-note, which he {{then transferred to}} a partnership. Barker {{was the son of}} Ormsby Gore's agent, while the partnership consisted of a surgeon called William Taylor, a <b>warehouseman</b> called John Pearce, both from London, and John Harper, who was from Porthmadog. Harper briefly acted as managing director, but was soon replaced by a naval captain called Richard Oliver. The agent or general manager was Thomas Jones, who had assisted Barker in his search for slate. On 27 June 1853, the partnership became the Rhosydd Slate Company, which negotiated the conversion of the take-note into a lease in September. Finished slates were carried by the Ffestiniog Railway in 1854, and in 1855 some Rhosydd slates were shipped from Porthmadog. In the following year, the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 was passed by parliament, and the quarrying company became the Rhosydd Slate Company Ltd on 7 November, under the terms of that act.|$|E

50|$|The {{union was}} founded in 1894 as the Amalgamated Society of Clothlookers and <b>Warehousemen,</b> and {{initially}} had just 203 members across five autonomous branches. These branches were in Blackburn, Burnley, Bury, Colne and Nelson, Great Harwood and Padiham. Early in the 1900s, these branches established greater co-ordination and the organisation was renamed the General Amalgamation of Clothlookers and <b>Warehousemen.</b> New district associations were established in other towns in Lancashire and Cheshire on the initiative of the amalgamation, and by 1910 it had 21 branches with 2,790 members.|$|R

2500|$|While the Supreme Court and Congress brooded on the case, Stanton {{attended}} to some personal matters. In February 1856 Stanton became engaged to Ellen Hutchinson, a girl sixteen years Stanton's junior. Stanton and Hutchinson {{met at a}} Pittsburgh church. She came from a prominent family in the city; her father was Lewis Hutchinson, a wealthy merchant and <b>warehouseman</b> and a descendent of Merriweather Lewis. Despite the Hutchinson's mother's apprehensiveness that her 26-year-old daughter was getting married to the 41-year-old Stanton, the two were married on June 25, 1856 at Hutchinson's father's home. They honeymooned at Niagara Falls, Montreal, the White Mountains and Nahant, Massachusetts. In his relationship to Hutchinson, Stanton reclaimed what {{he thought he had}} forever lost after the death of Mary, [...] "love of the abiding sort." [...] Stanton and Hutchinson moved to Washington after their marriage; part of this decision was rooted in Stanton's belief that he would see important work with the Supreme Court. They leased a home on C Street in Washington.|$|E
2500|$|His {{first major}} work, a satirical poem of nearly 400 lines in Pope's couplet form {{entitled}} Inebriety, was self-published in 1775. Crabbe later {{said of the}} poem, which received little or no attention at the time, [...] "Pray let not this be seen... {{there is very little}} of it that I'm not heartily ashamed of." [...] By this time he had completed his medical training and had returned home to Aldeburgh. He had intended to go on to London to study at a hospital, but he was forced through low finances to work for some time as a local <b>warehouseman.</b> He eventually travelled to London in 1777 to practice medicine, returning home in financial difficulty after a year. Crabbe continued to practice as a surgeon after returning to Aldeburgh, but as his surgical skills remained deficient, he attracted only the poorest patients, and his fees were small and undependable. This hurt his chances of an early marriage, but Sarah stayed devoted to him.|$|E

In 1903, the National Bookfolders' and Kindred Trades Union affiliated to the National Amalgamated Society, becoming the union's women's section.|$|R
