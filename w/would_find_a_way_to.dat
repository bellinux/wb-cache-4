5|$|Ueland was {{unanimously}} fired as CEO by NSB's {{board on}} 29 June. Immediately afterwards his deputy Randi Flesland resigned, {{after she had}} rejected the board's proposal for her to become acting CEO. The same day, Adtranz assumed full responsibility for the defects, and guaranteed that they would cover NSB's costs. In a report, Adtranz stated that the axles should be examined every , which would mean weekly inspections. They stated that they hoped further inquiries <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> have less frequent inspections. This was rejected by NSB, who would not have sufficient trains to run the schedules with such a tight inspection scheme. Instead, Adtranz and NSB agreed to a new programme which would involve inspection every three weeks.|$|E

They both {{indicated}} that the key factor was raising enough capital to proceed with the project, complete certification and commence production.|$|E
25|$|By 703, Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong {{had become}} resentful of Wei Yuanzhong, who by now {{was a senior}} chancellor, for {{dressing}} down their brother Zhang Changyi (張昌儀) and rejecting the promotion of another brother Zhang Changqi (張昌期). They also were fearful that if Wu Zetian died, Wei <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> execute them, and therefore accused Wei and Gao Jian (高戩), an official favoured by Princess Taiping, of speculating on Wu Zetian's old age and death. They initially got Wei's subordinate Zhang Shuo to agree to corroborate the charges, but once Zhang Shuo was before Wu Zetian, he instead accused Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong of forcing him to bear false witness. As a result, Wei, Gao, and Zhang Shuo were exiled, but escaped death.|$|E
60|$|This was {{a terrible}} task; but the queen had such just {{confidence}} in her Prigio that she soon dried her tears, remarking that Heaven would not desert Jaqueline, and that the king <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> out of the trouble.|$|R

5000|$|The prison experimented {{briefly in}} 1917-1918 with an [...] "honor system" [...] in which 130 prisoners were paroled with certain conditions. The prisoners were {{released}} into jobs outside the prison during the daytime.

500|$|Boston gangster Bobby Donati {{may have}} been {{involved}} in the heist. New England art thief Myles J. Connor Jr., in prison at the time of the robbery, has stated that he and associate Bobby Donati eyed the museum in the 1980s and Donati oversaw the operation. Shortly before the robbery, Donati was seen at a nightclub with a sack of police uniforms. Donati worked under Boston crime boss Vincent Ferrara, and visited him in prison in the early 1990s. When Ferrara asked about the robbery, Donati said he [...] "buried the stuff" [...] and <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> negotiate his release. Donati was murdered in 1991 as a result of ongoing gang wars.|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, Fazekas {{noted that}} the {{producers}} felt [...] "bad" [...] about the chances for a third season due to the series' low viewership, adding she [...] "would love to see it live on, even if it's in some other form, digital or whatever. I doubt that there's a Netflix play for it." [...] She also added that ABC wanted some sort of conclusion to the series, and so the writers and producers <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> conclude the lingering plot threads in some form if the series was not renewed. On May 12, 2016, ABC canceled the series. Loeb {{said he did not}} understand the decision, as [...] "there were no conversations" [...] regarding the series, with Marvel only receiving a call from ABC saying Agent Carter was canceled. He added that since the networks decide what content they would like from Marvel Television, [...] "if someone wants to call and say, 'We want a two-hour Agent Carter [...] for May 2017,' [...] We'll put together the greatest Agent Carter movie we can.” Atwell added that she was also not part of the conversation to cancel the series and called it [...] "a network political thing" [...] since ABC wanted Atwell to headline the more [...] "mainstream" [...] drama Conviction [...] "to get their ratings up" [...] instead of staying on Agent Carter, which Atwell felt had gained a [...] "cult following". After speculation regarding a revival for the series by Netflix, chief content officer Ted Sarandos stated the streaming service passed on reviving Agent Carter because it is [...] "looking for truly original brands to own and in that Marvel space we already have" [...] original Marvel series. He also added that due to existing international broadcasting [...] "deal complexities" [...] for the series, Netflix {{would not have been able}} to air Agent Carter globally, as [...] "Some of those output partners still had it on the air, so they would argue its covered by their output [...] Unfortunately, it was a business decision more than a creative one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Williams's {{advocate}} and editor Barbara Becnel {{was also a}} witness to Williams's execution. In the epilogue of Williams's reprinted memoir, Blue Rage, Black Redemption, Becnel reported that prior to Williams's arrival in the death chamber, he had promised her that [...] "he <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> lift his head and smile at me {{at some point during}} his execution, no matter what was being done to him.

I haven't bothered much up to the present because I was sure that you <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> out, which <b>would</b> be nothing to a man of your intellect and experience. I mean it honestly, I do indeed." ...|$|R
5000|$|She wasn’t {{exactly sure}} {{where she would}} put him, {{but she knew that}} they <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> they always did.

In the morning they could put together another bed and set another place at the table.|$|R

2500|$|... "While Mosaddegh {{dealt with}} {{political}} challenge, he faced another that most Iranians considered far more urgent. The British blockade of Iranian seaports meant that Iran was left {{without access to}} markets where it could sell its oil. The embargo {{had the effect of}} causing Iran to spiral into bankruptcy. Tens of thousands had lost their jobs at the Abadan refinery, and although most understood and passionately supported the idea of nationalisation, they naturally hoped that Mosaddegh <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> put them back to work. The only way he could do that was to sell oil." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hedberg {{occasionally}} added disclaimers {{to the end}} of a joke if it wasn't sufficiently well received, frequently {{variations on}} [...] "that joke's dumb, I'm aware of that." [...] During recordings for CDs, he would often say that he <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> edit a failed gag to make it seem well-received, for example by [...] "adding laughter" [...] to a failed joke containing arithmetic. Following such a failure on Strategic Grill Locations, Hedberg suggested, [...] "All right ... that joke is going to be good because I'm going to take all the words out and add new words. That joke will be fixed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Evert {{made her}} first {{semifinal}} at The Wimbledon Championships in 1972, {{which was a}} match that had a serve and volley player in Evonne Goolagong versus the baseliner Chris Evert. The match {{looked like it was}} going to the steely-eyed Evert, which she was up one-set to none and three-games to love in the second set and 30-love on Goolagong's service, but Goolagong reigned her focus back in and went on a comeback trail. At that point Googlagong <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> hold serve, and in the next game broke Evert's serve off a smash by Evert with a backhand winner to get to 32 in the second set. After that, Googlagong started bring Evert into net passing her with cross court shots to win the second set. In the third set, Evert and Googlagong had two tense games at 3-all in the third and pivotal set, which both held serve and leveled at 4-all, but from that point onwards Evert only won one point in the next two games and lost the spot in the finals. Evert had a great post match quote on Goolagong, [...] "But I will be playing Evonne many times again, and next time the pressure will be on her. There are plenty more Wimbledons ahead." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{might be}} difficult, he reflected, to {{approach}} Mel. But he <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way.</b> He <b>would</b> rest <b>a</b> few days--then <b>find</b> {{where she lived}} and go to see her. Could he help her? And he had an infinite exaltation {{in his power to}} help any one who had suffered. Lane recalled Mel's pale sweet face, the shadowed eyes, the sad tremulous lips. And this image of her seemed the most lasting of the impressions of the day.|$|R
60|$|Gilda was {{a terrible}} danger, of {{that there could be}} no doubt. Nicolaes had {{realized}} this to the full: the instinct of self-preservation was strong in him; he would think over Stoutenburg's bold suggestion and <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> how to act on it. And at the bottom of his tortuous heart Stoutenburg already cherished the hope that this new complication which had dragged Gilda into the net of his own intrigues would also ultimately throw her--a willing victim--into his loving arms.|$|R
2500|$|On August 21, 2009, the ELCA's Churchwide Assembly in Minneapolis {{voted to}} allow congregations {{to call and}} ordain gays and lesbians in {{committed}} monogamous relationships to serve as clergy. By a vote of 559 to 451, delegates approved a resolution declaring that the church <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for people in [...] "publicly accountable, lifelong, monogamous same-gender relationships" [...] to serve as official ministers. Congregations that {{do not wish to}} call these persons to ordained ministry are not required by these policy changes to do so.|$|R
2500|$|MCA {{signed the}} group shortly thereafter, {{releasing}} their second album Robbin' the Hood in 1994. The record was nevertheless carried by various independent distributors, which {{placed it in}} independent record shops, surf/skate shops, and [...] "head shops", in a marketing effort designed {{to appeal to the}} band's fan base. The band also adopted the Internet as a viable promotional tool, distributing their albums through early online music retailers. Despite this, Nowell had developed an addiction to heroin; at live performances, he would often be unable to make it through sets. On several occasions, he would steal the band's equipment for a night's performance to pawn for drug money, knowing band manager Michael [...] "Miguel" [...] Happoldt <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> re-acquire the equipment. He used clonidine patches in an attempt to quit, determined to do so both before signing to MCA and before the birth of his son the following year. Nowell was not the only rock star with a heroin habit in the mid-1990s; in 1996, Jonathan Melvoin of the Smashing Pumpkins died following an overdose, Art Alexakis of Everclear acknowledged his addiction, as did Phil Anselmo of Pantera, and heroin was found at the scene of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's death. [...] "Greater availability, higher quality, lower prices — I don't know why there's so much heroin around," [...] producer Leary remarked to Spin.|$|E

50|$|In late June, 1985, Moody, Betty, and Mahtob {{moved into}} their own apartment, {{limiting}} Moody’s surveillance and giving Betty more freedom. Betty contacted Rasheed again, but his friend still refused to take a child. One day, an unnamed individual instructed Betty {{to go to an}} address and ask for the manager Amahl, who <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for both Betty and Mahtob to escape. Amahl informed Betty that he had planned a route and was attempting to work out the details. However, after several months, Amahl was still trying to construct <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of escape.|$|R
50|$|In 1874 he sat as a {{model for}} John Everett Millais as he painted the picture The North West Passage. This picture {{depicted}} an old sailor declaring that England <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> through the Northwest Passage. Millais had seen Trelawny at the funeral of John Leech years before and decided that he would make the perfect figure for the drawing. Trelawny initially liked the picture, but he was angered when he saw that Millais had included a glass of grog in the picture. It was ultimately well received by critics.|$|R

60|$|They {{laughed and}} hooted, but Perseus turned away, {{his hand on}} his sword hilt, and left them to their festival, while the king rejoiced in his heart. Perseus dared not see his mother again, but he spoke to Dictys, saying that he knew himself now to be of an age when he must seek his fortune in other lands; and he bade Dictys guard his mother from wrong, as well as he might. Dictys promised that he <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of {{protecting}} Danae, and he gave Perseus three weighed wedges of gold (which were called 'talents,' and served as money), and lent him a ship, {{to take him to the}} mainland of Greece, there to seek his fortune.|$|R
