40|$|The {{extensive}} use of centrifugal pumps in mining, potable <b>water</b> supply <b>and</b> <b>sanitary</b> <b>installations</b> potentially present an opportunity for energy savings through pump efficiency monitoring. Pumping units in these applications typically incorporate a flexible coupling between the motor and the pump. This coupling permits some shaft misalignment and provides vibration isolation. It is however unknown how significant torsional vibration is between the motor output and the impeller input. Changes in shaft torsional vibration could {{be a result of}} variations in the impeller’s torque due to hydrodynamic loading, which may indicate the pump’s efficiency. This paper presents a preliminary experimental study into the shaft torsional vibration {{on each side of the}} coupling of a centrifugal pump. This is achieved using a non-contact technique involving two torsional laser vibrometers. In addition to providing a correlation to pump effi-ciency, the method also permits the investigation of impeller angular velocity frequency content and these aspects are discussed in the context of current state-of-the-art in monitoring of pump’s performance...|$|R

30|$|In {{terms of}} the {{classification}} of national level poverty-stricken counties, the intra-classification differences of different indicators’ contributions are larger than those of other classes, except for the housing indicator; the inter-classification differences of different indicators {{are similar to those}} of other classes, except for the two indicators of drinking <b>water’s</b> safety <b>and</b> <b>sanitary</b> facilities. This indicates that the multidimensional poverty difference is quite larger among different poverty level of counties, while the internal difference among those counties at the same poverty level is comparatively smaller. In {{terms of the}} classification of minority autonomous counties, the intra-classification differences of indicators’ contributions are larger than those of historic revolutionary base classes, except for the indicators of adult’s illiteracy, drinking <b>water’s</b> safety <b>and</b> <b>sanitary</b> facilities. The inter-classification differences of different indicators {{are similar to those of}} other classes, except for drinking <b>water’s</b> safety <b>and</b> <b>sanitary</b> facilities. This indicates that the multidimensional poverty difference is greater between minority autonomous counties and non-minority autonomous counties, while the internal difference of the same classes is comparatively smaller. Overall, the poverty contributions of the two indicators, i.e., housing and adults’ illiteracy, show bigger intra-classification differences, while those of the other two indicators, drinking <b>water’s</b> availability <b>and</b> <b>sanitary</b> facilities, show bigger difference not only in intra-classification, but also in inter-classification.

A council for urban development was formed in May 1972 with the purpose of promoting future work and measures in the field of urban renovation. In 1973, the government provided assistance of DM 28 million for the modernisation of old dwellings. New rules were introduced regarding improvements in the law relating to rented property, and control of the rise in rents and protection against cancellation of leases also safeguarded the rights of migrant workers in the sphere of housing. A law of July 1973 fixed the fundamental and minimum requirements regarding workers' dwellings, mainly concerning space, ventilation and lighting, protection against damp, heat and noise, power and heating facilities <b>and</b> <b>sanitary</b> <b>installations.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{developing}} countries, {{connection to}} sewer systems is often costly for poor households, despite typically low monthly sewer tariffs. This apparent paradox {{is explained by}} {{the high costs of}} in-plot <b>and</b> in-house <b>sanitary</b> <b>installations</b> that have to be paid entirely by the user, by sometimes high sewer connection fees levied by utilities, and by a lack of community consultation. As a result, in many cities in developing countries conventional sewers are laid at high costs under a street, while many users on that street do not connect to them. In Brazil, in some cities connection rates in the early 1990s were less than 40% of the intended beneficiary population.|$|R
