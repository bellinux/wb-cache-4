500|$|The {{idea for}} Augusta National {{originated}} with Bobby Jones, {{who wanted to}} build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

Despite the story's analogies to her own life, Niffenegger has forcefully stated that Clare is not a self-portrait; [...] "She's radically different.

[...] Music critic and author Tim Riley writes: [...] "If the song is about self-worth and self-consolation in the face of hardship, the vocal performance itself conveys much of the journey. He begins by singing to comfort someone else, finds himself weighing his own feelings in the process, and finally, in the repeated refrains that nurture his own approbation, he comes to believe in himself." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{speed and}} {{facility}} with which Dylan wrote topical songs {{attracted the attention}} of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as [...] "the most prolific songwriter on the scene" [...] and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, [...] "I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End." [...] Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation. In an interview with Sing Out! magazine, Dylan said, [...] "The songs are there. They exist all by themselves just <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> write them down.

500|$|On lap 39, James Hinchcliffe {{fell victim}} to the deteriorating track. Going through turn six, he struck {{a large piece of}} asphalt that had lifted from the track. After hitting his front wing, it then went under the car and {{propelled}} it into the air. With no traction, Hinchcliffe was unable to control his car and was sent into the tire wall. Hinchcliffe was angry after the race, and claimed that the track should have been fixed earlier: [...] "The fact that (race control) let it go as far as they did, essentially <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> crash as a result of it before they did something, is very unsafe." [...] He said that the track had lifted much earlier in the race, but that the drivers had been forced to keep avoiding the debris, which was on the racing line. On the same lap, Takuma Sato clipped the curb going into turn 12 and lost control of his car before hitting the wall, forcing his retirement. The two crashes drew a full track caution, and the cars drove behind the safety car for six laps before a red flag was given on lap 45.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1960, Toole {{accepted}} a three-year fellowship {{to study for}} a Ph.D. in Renaissance literature at the University of Washington at Seattle. However, when he was offered a teaching position at Hunter College in New York, which suited his desire to study at Columbia, he chose to go there instead. At 22, he became the youngest professor in Hunter's history. Although he pursued a doctorate at Columbia, he became unhappy with his Ph.D. However, he wrote to Fletcher that he still liked Hunter, [...] "principally because the aggressive, pseudo-intellectual, 'liberal' girl students are continuously amusing." [...] Fletcher surmised that from these girls the character of Myrna Minkoff from Dunces was born. Toole, although generally only a [...] "Christmas-and-Easter churchgoer", had some apprehension about the anti-Catholic intellectualism {{of some of his}} students, and about them seeming ever watchful for a cause they could throw their liberal zeal behind. [...] "Every time the elevator door opens at Hunter, you are confronted by 20 pairs of burning eyes, 20 sets of bangs and everyone <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> push a Negro" [...] he is reported to have said. When he first arrived back in New York Toole dated Emilie Dietrich Griffin, another Louisiana transplant, with whom he had worked on the Hullabaloo staff, and later he dated another Louisianan, Clayelle Dalferes, whom he had learned of through Fletcher. The couple loved the cinema and movie-going was a constant staple of their dates. Both women said their relationships with Toole never progressed beyond the level of a good night kiss.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a review}} of the film for the New York Post, critic Lou Lumenick rated Knight and Day with one and a half out of four stars. Lumenick wrote, [...] "this is a big, dumb summer movie with no {{apparent}} ambition other than plugging a hole in a studio’s schedule because its faded star happened to be available for a few weeks." [...] American film critic and professor Emanuel Levy was critical of the film's writing, calling it a [...] "mindless flick"; he noted, [...] "The story moves at a breakneck speed, as if to conceal the incongruities in the storytelling." [...] Levy gave the film a grade of [...] "C", and commented, [...] "Preposterously plotted, the saga is dominated by long, energetic, uneven action sequences, but it lacks any logic and pays minimal attention to characterization. Repetitious in structure, and with humor that more often than not misses the mark, 'Knight and Day' is characterized by nihilistic violence and amoral tone, which wouldn't have mattered had the movie been witty or fun to watch." [...] Simon Abrams of Slant Magazine gave the film a rating of two stars out of four, and commented of the film's director and writer, [...] "Clearly O'Neill and Mangold are trying to give viewers what producers would undoubtedly like to sell as 'something for everybody,' but there's no consistency to the thing and no chemistry whatsoever between Cruise and Diaz, making the alternating tug-of-war between girly and manly elements of the film seem extraordinarily forced." [...] In a review published in The Victoria Advocate, Robert Philpot of McClatchy Newspapers called the movie [...] "disposable", and singled out the film's script as its [...] "biggest problem", commenting that it [...] "feels lazy right from its lame-pun title". The Miami Herald film critic Rene Rodriguez wrote that there was [...] "no chemistry between Cruise and Diaz", and commented regarding Cruise's acting, [...] "Tom Cruise spends much of 'Knight and Day' looking as if he's <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> pour casting mold over his head to make an action figure." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, at Jiangdu, it {{was said}} that Emperor Yang's {{lifestyle}} grew increasingly decadent. [...] His palace contained over 100 chambers, each exceedingly luxurious and full of beautiful women. [...] The women of each chamber would serve as hostesses for a feast each day, and Emperor Yang, Empress Xiao, and Emperor Yang's favored concubines would be their guests. [...] Emperor Yang began to come to the realization that his fall was near, but still commented as if he did not care. [...] It was said that on one occasion, he told Empress Xiao, [...] "There must be many people who want to hurt me. [...] However, I will at least be the Duke of Changcheng , and you will at least be like Empress Shen [...] [...] Do not worry. [...] Let us drink and be merry." [...] It was also said that on another occasion, when he was looking in the mirror, he told Empress Xiao, [...] "I have a good neck, and I'm <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> sever it." [...] Empress Xiao, surprised and distressed by his comment, asked him why he was saying so, and he responded and smiled, [...] "Honor and wealth and poverty and dishonor, as well as pain and pleasure, all come in cycles. [...] Why be distressed?" [...] Meanwhile, not wanting to return to the turbulent north, he discussed with his officials about moving the capital to Danyang (丹楊, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu). [...] His elite Xiaoguo Army guards, missing their families in the north and realizing that Emperor Yang did not intend to return north, began to desert. [...] Their commanders Sima Dekan (司馬德勘), Yuan Li (元禮), and Pei Qiantong (裴虔通), worried that Emperor Yang would punish them, began considering rebelling and taking the Xiaoguo Army north themselves instead. [...] They associated with a number of other officers and officials, discussing so publicly that even the ladies in waiting began to hear about it. [...] When one reported to Empress Xiao, Empress Xiao had her report to Emperor Yang—but Emperor Yang, not wishing to hear about the bad news, beheaded her. [...] When another reported to Empress Xiao, Empress Xiao no longer permitted her to report to Emperor Yang, figuring that it was too late.|$|E

60|$|So {{we waited}} for the great Città di Trieste to float her way into Palermo harbour. It looked so near--the town there, the great circle of the port, {{the mass of the}} hills {{crowding}} round. Panormus, the All-harbour. I wished the bulky steamer would hurry up. For I hated her now. I hated her swankiness, she seemed made for commercial travellers with cash. I hated the big picture that filled one end of the state-room: an elegant and ideal peasant-girl, a sort of Italia, strolling on a lovely and ideal cliff's edge, among myriad blooms, and carrying over her arm, in a most sophisticated fashion, a bough of almond blossom and a sheaf of anemones. I hated the waiters, and the cheap elegance, the common de luxe. I disliked the people, who all turned their worst, cash-greasy sides outwards on this ship. Vulgar, vulgar post-war commercialism and dog-fish money-stink. I longed to get off. And the bloated boat edged her way so slowly into the port, and then more slowly still edged round her fat stern. And even then we were kept for fifteen minutes <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> put up the gangway for the first class.
