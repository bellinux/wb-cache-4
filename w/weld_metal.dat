5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas metal arc welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E
5|$|To {{identify}} different electrodes, the American Welding Society {{established a}} system that assigns electrodes with a four- or five-digit number. Covered electrodes made of mild or low alloy steel carry the prefix E, followed by their number. The first two or three digits of the number specify the tensile strength of the <b>weld</b> <b>metal,</b> in thousand {{pounds per square inch}} (ksi). The penultimate digit generally identifies the welding positions permissible with the electrode, typically using the values 1 (normally fast-freeze electrodes, implying all position welding) and 2 (normally fast-fill electrodes, implying horizontal welding only). The welding current and type of electrode covering are specified by the last two digits together. When applicable, a suffix is used to denote the alloying element being contributed by the electrode.|$|E
5|$|Resistance welding {{was also}} {{developed}} during the final decades of the 19th century, with the first patents going to Elihu Thomson in 1885, who produced further advances over the next 15 years. Thermite welding was invented in 1893, and around that time another process, oxyfuel welding, became well established. Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by Edmund Davy, but its use was not practical in welding until about 1900, when a suitable torch was developed. At first, oxyfuel welding {{was one of the}} more popular welding methods due to its portability and relatively low cost. As the 20th century progressed, however, it fell out of favor for industrial applications. It was largely replaced with arc welding, as advances in metal coverings (known as flux) were made. Flux covering the electrode primarily shields the base material from impurities, but also stabilizes the arc and can add alloying components to the <b>weld</b> <b>metal.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This study {{aimed to}} assess creep crack growth {{rates on the}} base and <b>welded</b> <b>metals</b> of {{modified}} 9 Cr- 1 Mo steel. For this purpose, welded specimens were prepared by the Shielded <b>Metal</b> Arc <b>Weld</b> method. To obtain mechanical properties concerning the base and <b>welded</b> <b>metals,</b> a series of creep and tensile tests were conducted at 600 ºC, and creep crack growth tests were also performed under different applied loads using 1 / 2 " compact tension specimens at 600 ºC. Their creep crack growth rates were calculated using the empirical equation of the da/dt vs. C * parameter and compared. It appeared that, for a given value of C*, the rate of creep crack propagation was about 2. 0 times faster in the <b>welded</b> <b>metal</b> than the base metal. This reason was that the <b>welded</b> <b>metal</b> was faster in the creep strain rate than the base metal...|$|R
40|$|The {{aspect ratio}} and {{morphology}} of acicular ferrite formed in C-Mn-Ni <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> {{and the effect}} of nickel and oxygen contents have been investigated. The experimental results revealed that nickel has a strong effect on the acicularity of acicular ferrite in C-Mn-Ni <b>weld</b> <b>metals.</b> High nickel contents resulted in sharper acicularferrite laths with a larger aspect ratio. It is considered that the two dominant mechanisms are the role of nickel in changing the balance of incoherent/coherent growth ledges, and the transformation temperatures at which this growth takes place. Reducing the oxygen content in the <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> was also found to increase the aspect ratio...|$|R
5|$|Shielding gases are {{necessary}} for {{gas metal arc welding}} to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> embrittlement if they come in contact with the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. This problem is common to all arc welding processes; for example, in the older Shielded-Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW), the electrode is coated with a solid flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by the arc. In GMAW, however, the electrode wire does not have a flux coating, and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect the weld. This eliminates slag, the hard residue from the flux that builds up after welding and must be chipped off to reveal the completed weld.|$|E
5|$|While the {{aerospace}} industry {{is one of the}} primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used {{in a number of other}} areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces, especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter, thin-wall tubing such as those used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of aluminum and magnesium. Because the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most open arc welding processes, a vast assortment of welding filler metal is available to the welding engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations. Filler metal alloys, such as elemental aluminum and chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization. This loss does not occur with the GTAW process. Because the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the base metals more closely, GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW the welding procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial.|$|E

25|$|The {{fracture}} surfaces on {{the outer}} part of the left wing were examined by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at its Division of Aeronautics in Melbourne. These examinations determined that separation of the left wing was initiated by metal fatigue of the lower main spar boom attachment socket. The primary structure of the Stinson was of welded steel tube construction. A fatigue crack had initiated in <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> on the inner surface of the socket. After propagating through the <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> during {{a large number of}} flights, the fatigue crack entered the socket's parent metal. This crack eventually affected 45% of the cross-section of the socket before the lower boom failed on the fatal flight. Investigators noted the amount of metal in the socket that was unaffected by the fatigue crack {{at the time of the}} accident and calculated that the wing was capable of supporting loads up to about 2.5 times the weight of the aircraft on its fatal flight. This suggested the gusting winds prevailing at the time, and the turbulence associated with the low altitude at which the aircraft was flying, were partly responsible for the failure.|$|E
500|$|The dabber {{variation}} {{is used to}} precisely place <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> on thin edges. [...] The automatic process replicates the motions of manual welding by feeding a cold or hot filler wire into the weld area and dabbing (or oscillating) it into the welding arc. [...] It {{can be used in}} conjunction with pulsed current, and is used to weld a variety of alloys, including titanium, nickel, and tool steels. [...] Common applications include rebuilding seals in jet engines and building up saw blades, milling cutters, drill bits, and mower blades.|$|E
500|$|Electrode {{selection}} is {{based primarily on}} {{the composition of the}} metal being welded, the process variation being used, joint design and the material surface conditions. Electrode selection greatly influences the mechanical properties of the weld and is a key factor of weld quality. In general the finished <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> should have mechanical properties {{similar to those of the}} base material with no defects such as discontinuities, entrained contaminants or porosity within the weld. To achieve these goals a wide variety of electrodes exist. [...] All commercially available electrodes contain deoxidizing metals such as silicon, manganese, titanium and aluminum in small percentages to help prevent oxygen porosity. Some contain denitriding metals such as titanium and zirconium to avoid nitrogen porosity. Depending on the process variation and base material being welded the diameters of the electrodes used in GMAW typically range from 0.7 to 2.4mm (0.028 – 0.095in) but can be as large as 4mm (0.16in). The smallest electrodes, generally up to 1.14mm (0.045in) are associated with the short-circuiting metal transfer process, while the most common spray-transfer process mode electrodes are usually at least 0.9mm (0.035in).|$|E

40|$|A {{study using}} some {{available}} high-quality data from German surveillance and research programmes {{has been carried}} out in order to provide evidence on the prediction capabilities of a semi-mechanistic model for changes in ductile to brittle transition temperature.

This study demonstrates that the model can predict very well all the results obtained on low nickel–manganese <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> and that the corrections required for high nickel–manganese <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> are consistent with those found for model alloys. An important additional conclusion is that a strong effect of chromium can be identified; <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> with higher chromium contents show much less sensitivity to radiation embrittlement and a drastic reduction, up to 50 percent, of the main embrittlement model parameters is required to reproduce the data.

500|$|Though SMAW {{is almost}} {{exclusively}} a manual arc welding process, one notable process variation exists, known as gravity welding or gravity arc welding. It {{serves as an}} automated version of the traditional shielded metal arc welding process, employing an electrode holder attached to an inclined bar {{along the length of}} the weld. Once started, the process continues until the electrode is spent, allowing the operator to manage multiple gravity welding systems. The electrodes employed (often E6027 or E7024) are coated heavily in flux, and are typically [...] in length and about [...] thick. As in manual SMAW, a constant current welding power supply is used, with either negative polarity direct current or alternating current. Due to a rise in the use of semiautomatic welding processes such as flux-cored arc welding, the popularity of gravity welding has fallen as its economic advantage over such methods is often minimal. Other SMAW-related methods that are even less frequently used include firecracker welding, an automatic method for making butt and fillet welds, and massive electrode welding, a process for welding large components or structures that can deposit up to [...] of <b>weld</b> <b>metal</b> per hour.|$|E

40|$|A {{critical}} {{investigation into}} the role of non-metallic inclusions in the nucleation of acicular ferrite in low alloy C-Mn-Ni <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> was carried out using rapid in situ quenching, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis, and dilatometric techniques. The relationship between the transformed acicular ferrite, the inclusions, and the chemical nature of the inclusions which had actually nucleated ferrite laths was examined in detail. By employing <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> with either intermediate (200 - 350 ppm) or low (15 - 30 ppm) oxygen levels, the inclusion chemistry and nucleation behaviour ofacicular ferrite in welds with different oxygen contents were compared. In addition, the influence of the [Al]/[O] ratio in lower oxygen content <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> was also examined. It was found that the first acicular ferrite laths nucleated from the inclusions at both oxygen levels, and the chemical composition of the active inclusions varied considerably. The inclusions nucleated acicularferrite by acting simply as inert substrates with the ability to reduce the free energy barrier to nucleation. The number and size distribution of the inclusions appeared to be the dominant factors; the thermal stress-strain fields and lattice disregistry were less important. The most favourable type of inclusions were within the size range 0. 3 - 0. 9 ?m for the higher oxygen content <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> and 0. 35 - 0. 75 ?m for the lower oxygen level <b>weld</b> <b>metals.</b> A high [Al]/[O] ratio depresses the formation of acicular ferrite by increasing the soluble matrix aluminium content, which encourages extensive ferrite sideplate formation; the concurrent variation in inclusion chemical composition did not appear to influence the nucleation of acicular ferrite...|$|R

The addition of nickel initially depressed the prior austenite grain size and subsequently dramatically coarsened it. This was related to the nickel equivalent (Nieq) of the <b>weld</b> <b>metals</b> and the peritectic reaction during the solidification process. Small columnar grains were associated with a Nieq between 3. 4 and 6. 2 % which resulted in a peritectic reaction when the weld melt solidified, whilst a Nieq higher than 6. 2 % produced very large columnar grains because the weld pool would directly solidify into austenite and have a subsequent continuous growth...|$|R

Edge <b>welded</b> <b>metal</b> bellows (EWMB) are an elegant way to manufacture bellows structures out of simple doughnut-like shape disks.

However, there are side effects for using welded bellows that have tormented bellows design engineers and prevented the improvements in the performance and reliability of edge <b>welded</b> <b>metal</b> bellows. ^ The first {{problem is that the}} force-deflection response of <b>welded</b> <b>metal</b> bellows is unpredictable when it is subjected to combined stroke and pressure loading. This information is especially important for the <b>welded</b> <b>metal</b> bellows used in mechanical face seals. The sudden reaction force increase associated with the higher operating pressure (also known as the effective diameter shift problem) will usually destroy a balanced seal design. This study has developed an analytical procedure and demonstrated that the finite element method can be used to solve the mystery of effective diameter shift. ^ The second problem is that the fatigue life prediction of <b>welded</b> <b>metal</b> bellows is difficult caused by its built-in crack-like geometry which creates stress risers in the structures and singularities in the mathematical models.
