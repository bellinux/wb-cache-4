Dress clearly {{plays an important role}} in both types of objectification, facilitating objectification. The use of physiological measures may help to elucidate how objectification occurs and <b>what</b> its effects <b>are.</b> <b>Objectification</b> theory also holds promise for researchers studying dress and violence. Longitudinal research may benefit researchers studying dress as a cue to sexual information to assess its effect on human development. Cross-cultural studies are recommended regarding dress as an expression of sexuality, as well as relationships between dress and sexual violence.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} theoretical approaches to understanding the pervasiveness of problems of poor body image and disturbed patterns of eating among women <b>is</b> <b>objectification</b> theory (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997). According to these theorists, being raised in a culture that objectifies the female body and sexualizes all women leads to women objectifying themselves, termed “self-objectifi-cation ” (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997). Self-objectifica-tion is, in turn, postulated to be related to increased risk of psychological problems, including eating disorders, depression, and sexual dysfunction. In a related conceptualization, McKinley and Hyde (1996) proposed that women’s internalization of social constructions of the female body leads to an “objectified body consciousness, ” or the experience of one’s body as a...|$|R

5000|$|The {{aesthetic}} {{problem is}} also treated by two other philosophers whose thought {{set out from}} certain tendencies in Kant's system, namely Schopenhauer and Herbart. Schopenhauer (see also The World as Will and Idea, translated by R. B. Haldane, esp. vol. i. pp. 219-346), abandoning also Kant's doctrine of the subjectivity of beauty, found in aesthetic contemplation the perfect emancipation of intellect from will. In this contemplation the mind is filled with pure intellectual forms, the [...] "Platonic Ideas" [...] as he calls them, which <b>are</b> <b>objectifications</b> of the will at a certain grade of completeness of representation. He exalts the state of artistic contemplation {{as the one in}} which, as pure intellect set free from will, the misery of existence is surmounted and something of blissful ecstasy attained. He holds that all things are in some degree beautiful, ugliness being viewed as merely imperfect manifestation or objectification of will. In this way the beauty of nature, somewhat slighted by Schelling and Hegel, is rehabilitated.|$|R

Objectification increases self-objectification, where women judge their own body parts as a mean of praise and pleasure for others. There is a significant link between self-objectification, body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating, as the beauty ideal is altered through social media.|$|R

40|$|The project <b>is</b> about feminism, <b>objectification</b> and {{empowerment}} as portrayed through the comic Empowered from 2007. The discussion {{centers around the}} repercussions of objectification in the comic, and how it illustrates women’s position in a postmodern society. Objectification identification theories by Nussbaum, Langton and Heldman have been applied to the comic to establish how <b>objectification</b> <b>is</b> displayed in the comic. The analysis found that the protagonist of the comic is both objectified by the other characters and the reader. Theories by Simone de Beauvoir and Immanuel Kant are used in order to explore objectification, and the effect it has on the individual and on the female gender both within the comic and on a broader scale. Through {{the analysis of the}} comic it was discovered that female empowerment is potentially impossible when the individual <b>is</b> subjected to <b>objectification.</b> The project also utilizes arguments from the feminist Sex Wars to discuss whether individual empowerment can be achieved under arguably sexist circumstances. The paper found that even if individual empowerment is achieved, it is still under certain restrictions because only a societal change can permanently alter the gender norms and social constructs that lead to objectification...|$|R
