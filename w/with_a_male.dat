5|$|All of Godwin's {{books written}} from 1970 to 1990 are fictional stories based on themes taken from Godwin's life. Her early works focus on women {{hoping for a}} {{relationship}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> companion, {{but at the same}} time wanting independence and freedom. The main protagonist is often restricted by family, tradition and patriarchy. Most of Godwin's early works include a prominent mother-daughter relationship as well.|$|E
5|$|Although their ranges overlap substantially, {{hybridisation}} between goldcrests and firecrests {{seems to}} be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns. Even in aviary studies in which a female goldcrest was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> firecrest, the chicks were never raised by the mixed pair, {{and appeared to be}} poorly adapted compared to the parent species.|$|E

5|$|Applewhite {{moved to}} New York City in an {{unsuccessful}} attempt {{to launch a}} professional singing career upon finishing his education in Colorado. He then taught at the University of Alabama. He lost his position there after pursuing a sexual relationship <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> student; his religious education was likely not supportive of same-sex relationships and he was subsequently frustrated by his sexual desires. He separated from his wife when she learned of the affair in 1965, and they divorced three years later.|$|E
5|$|As a {{character}} in the games, Mewtwo's physical appearance is not its only stark divergence from Mew. While the alterations to the genetic source material it was cloned resulted in its abilities surpassing Mew's, it also resulted in Mewtwo developing a vicious personality that is primarily interested in proving its own strength. The franchise's non-video game media, particularly the anime, has expanded upon the character. In the most notable instance, Mewtwo telepathically speaks <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> voice and is existentially torn over its purpose in the world.|$|E

50|$|During {{territorial}} defense, the <b>male</b> defends <b>a</b> sunny {{spot in the}} forest, {{waiting for}} females to stop by. Another strategy is patrolling, during which males fly through the forest actively searching for females. Then, the female must make a choice between mating <b>with</b> <b>a</b> patrolling <b>male</b> or <b>a</b> territorial <b>male.</b> By mating <b>with</b> <b>a</b> territorial <b>male,</b> <b>a</b> female {{can be sure that}} she has chosen <b>a</b> high quality <b>male,</b> as the ability to defend a territory reflects the genetic quality of <b>a</b> <b>male.</b> Therefore, by choosing <b>a</b> territorial <b>male,</b> the female is being more picky about which male she chooses to mate with.|$|R
40|$|Insect {{males of}} several {{parasitoid}} species have {{limited amount of}} sperm at emergence and experience sperm depletion when mate acquisition rate is high, suggesting that sperm production and storage could be a limiting factor for male's fitness. Sperm-depleted males of the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma evanescens continue to mate, {{and the impact of}} this behavior on sperm storage by females has been studied. Virgin females T. evanescens stored 50. 6 � 13. 1 (Mean � SD) sperm when mating first <b>with</b> <b>a</b> virgin <b>male.</b> However, when these females mated first <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sperm-depleted <b>male</b> and then <b>with</b> <b>a</b> virgin <b>male,</b> they stored only 18. 9 � 7. 8 sperm, indicating that mating <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sperm-depleted <b>male</b> has <b>a</b> cost and limits sperm acquisition from fertile <b>males.</b> Following <b>a</b> mating <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sperm-depleted <b>male,</b> females had to mate with three virgin males to restore their sperm supply confirming that additional mating enabled the female to store a limited number of sperm. According to our results, by continuing to mate, sperm-depleted males do not prevent mates from copulating again but they decrease their ability to store other male's sperm. Continuing to mate could be a strategy to increase the relative fitness of sperm-depleted males. Copyright 2006. Hymenoptera; polyandry; reproduction; reproductive strategy...|$|R
5|$|Originally written <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> protagonist, with Tom Cruise {{initially}} secured for the lead, {{the script}} was ultimately rewritten by Brian Helgeland for Jolie. Filming {{took place on}} location in Washington, D.C., the New York City area, and Albany, New York, between March and June 2009, with reshoots in January 2010. Action scenes were primarily performed with practical stunts, computer-generated imagery being used mostly for creating digital environments.|$|E
5|$|The {{males of}} {{many species of}} Papilionoidea are {{furnished}} with secondary sexual characteristics. These consist of scent-producing organs, brushes, and brands or pouches of specialised scales. These presumably meet the function of convincing the female that she is mating <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> of the correct species.|$|E
5|$|The {{subject of}} the series, whose name was never released, was an {{intersex}} person <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> build and stature, but who may have self-identified as female and/or been assigned female at birth. The subject had a small, probably hypospadic, penis, rudimentary scrotum, and male pubic hair pattern. The subject also had a retracted or rudimentary clitoral hood and vaginal opening. In most photographs the subject's face and chest are covered.|$|E

40|$|If mating <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{inferior}} <b>male</b> {{has high}} fitness costs, females {{may try to}} avoid mating with these males. Alternatively, females may accept <b>an</b> inferior <b>male</b> to ensure they have obtained at least one mate, and/or to avoid the costs of resisting these males. We hypothesized that females compensate for mating <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inferior <b>male</b> by remating. We tested this hypothesis by measuring remating propensity in females that had mated <b>with</b> <b>an</b> old, multiply-mated <b>male,</b> <b>a</b> 9 -day-old virgin <b>male,</b> or <b>a</b> young, virgin <b>male.</b> Females {{were more likely to}} remate when they had mated with multiply-mated males than when they had mated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 9 -day-old or young virgin male. We discuss the observed mating behavior by females in terms of sexual selection for multiple mating...|$|R

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Rihanna walking towards a white Jeep Wrangler, but stops {{due to her}} mobile phone ringing. As Rihanna answers, she converses <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> friend, presumably her boyfriend. As she tells him {{that she needs to}} do some things before meeting with him, Rihanna hangs up and the screen cuts to a black screen. As a visual of Rihanna driving along a bridge in the Florida Keys, the song begins to play. During the first verse, {{different}} scenes are intercut of Rihanna, including a close-up shot of the singer driving behind the wheel is shown, walking along the beach and dancing in a black dress against a white backdrop, as she sings about how her boyfriend has been seeing another girl without Rihanna knowing. For the first chorus, in addition to the other three scenes, one shot is shown of Rihanna dancing with a man in a nightclub. During the second verse, Rihanna is shown lying down on the beach and playing in the water, as well as dancing <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> dancer against a white backdrop, this time wearing a lace dress.|$|E
5|$|Tipping the Velvet is a {{historical}} novel published as Sarah Waters' debut novel in 1998. Set in Victorian England during the 1890s, it tells a coming of age story about a young woman named Nan {{who falls in love}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> impersonator, follows her to London, and finds various ways to support herself as she journeys through the city. The picaresque plot elements have prompted scholars and reviewers to compare it to similar British urban adventure stories written by Charles Dickens and Daniel Defoe.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} ending {{was present}} in the behind-the-scenes video, showing an exhausted Madonna leaving the party <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> model, as well as aftermath scenes of the party which were released in the first teaser trailer. The parting shot showed Madonna running {{around the room and}} posing in front of the windows overlooking New York. Other scenes included Madonna chatting with Ora and Rock in-between takes, sitting in the hallways, plunging towards the neon sock puppets multiple times as well as singing the song with the little girls {{from the beginning of the}} video. Another video set to Kleinenberg's remix featured further footage of Madonna dancing and more casual scenes featuring the guest stars.|$|E

5|$|Dalton {{taught for}} sixty years. She taught her pupils energetically {{in spite of}} having crude {{educational}} resources. In 1891, Dalton encouraged other women teachers {{to ask for a}} raise. The board of education did give the teachers a raise, but considered Dalton responsible for their petitioning and demanded that she pay the difference from her salary. When Dalton refused, they replaced her <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> teacher. Luckily, the city of Payson requested that Dalton teach at their school, and she moved there happily. Later she taught in Ogden and Manti. She served as an officer of the territorial women's suffrage association. Her sister Rose was vice-president of the Utah State Chapter of Women Voters.|$|E
5|$|Gopalam, the zamindar of Appapuram, is the {{principal}} {{of a high school}} named after his elder daughter Mahalakshmi. As a child, she went missing during a pilgrimage to the Godavari River pushkaram in Kakinada. Conditions at the school deteriorate due to mismanagement by Gopalam's nephew, A. K. Raju, an amateur detective. This is exacerbated when Panthulu, an ayurvedic doctor, teaches the children. Gopalam decides to replace them <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> and a female graduate (preferably a married couple) capable of training his younger daughter Sita in singing besides teaching children at the school.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a 9-year-old female blacktip shark at the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center {{was found}} to be {{pregnant}} with a single near-term female pup, despite having never mated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>male.</b> Genetic analysis confirmed that her offspring was the product of automictic parthenogenesis, a form of asexual reproduction in which an ovum merges with a polar body to form a zygote without fertilization. Along with an earlier case of parthenogenesis in the bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo), this event suggests that asexual reproduction may be more widespread in sharks than previously thought.|$|E

5|$|In May 1914, Carl Larsson resumed {{the work}} on the {{painting}} on his own initiative. During 1915, he presented a painted sketch (№ 239), which was largely consistent with the previous painting. The king had been remade based on an oil painting (№ 240) that Larsson had made <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> model named Rydberg in 1914. The king's position was more pathetically composed and expressive and it agreed more with the change of emphasis that had taken place during the evolution of the work after Larsson's decision that the sacrifice was voluntary.|$|E
5|$|The series {{focuses on}} a high school show choir, {{also known as a}} glee club, in the fictional William McKinley High School in Lima, Ohio. Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) takes over the glee club after the former teacher Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky) is fired for {{inappropriate}} contact <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> student. With a rag-tag group of misfit teenagers, Will attempts to restore the glee club to its former glory while tending to his developing feelings for his co-worker, guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), as well as defending the glee club's existence from the conniving cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch). A major focus of the series is the students in the glee club: their relationships as couples, their love of singing and desire for popularity coming into conflict due to their membership in the low-status club, and the many vicissitudes of life in high school and as a teenager.|$|E
5|$|The {{wood turtle}} {{takes a long}} time to reach sexual maturity, has a low {{fecundity}} (ability to reproduce), but has a high adult survival rate. However, the high survival rates are not true of juveniles or hatchlings. Although males establish hierarchies, they are not territorial. The wood turtle becomes sexually mature between 14 and 18 years of age. Mating activity among wood turtles peaks in the spring and again in the fall, although it is known to mate throughout the portion of the year they are active. However, it has been observed mating in December. In one rare instance, a female wood turtle hybridized <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>male</b> Blanding's turtle.|$|E
25|$|Some animals opportunistically {{mate with}} {{individuals}} of another species. This is more commonly observed in domesticated species and animals in captivity, possibly because captivity is associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> decrease in aggression {{and an increase}} in sexual receptivity. Nevertheless, animals in the wild have been observed to attempt sexual activity with other species. It is mostly documented among species that belong to the same genus, but sometimes occurs between species of distant taxa. Alfred Kinsey cites reports of sexual activity involving <b>a</b> female eland <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ostrich, <b>a</b> <b>male</b> dog <b>with</b> <b>a</b> chicken, <b>a</b> <b>male</b> monkey <b>with</b> <b>a</b> snake, and <b>a</b> female chimpanzee <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cat.|$|R
