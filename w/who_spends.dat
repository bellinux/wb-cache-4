Both countries have sizable minorities living across their common border, and both have passed laws to protect their minority rights.|$|E

25|$|His art {{often had}} a strong moralizing element to it, such as in his {{masterpiece}} of 1732–33, A Rake's Progress, engraved in 1734.

25|$|Example: We visit every {{household}} {{in a given}} street, and interview {{the first person to}} answer the door. In any household with more than one occupant, this is a nonprobability sample, because some {{people are more likely to}} answer the door (e.g. an unemployed person <b>who</b> <b>spends</b> most of their time at home is more likely to answer than an employed housemate who might be at work when the interviewer calls) and it's not practical to calculate these probabilities.|$|E
25|$|In Chapter 25, Lamb meets {{a little}} girl with her broken leg in a cast <b>who</b> <b>spends</b> the day looking {{out of the window}} at the neighbours, whom she has given fanciful {{descriptive}} names. The inspiration for this plot device is possibly Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film, Rear Window, a nod to a classic. In the same chapter, the little girl refers to a neighbour called Miss Bulstrode, though it seems unlikely that the character is the same Miss Bulstrode from Cat Among the Pigeons.|$|E

Over the course of the series, Umaru's alternative personalities help her become friends with her female classmates Kirie Motoba, who has a reputation of glaring at people; and Sylphynford Tachibana, her competitive school rival; both of whom turn out to be little sisters of Taihei's coworkers.|$|E

The main monastic body with membership of 1,160 monks is headed by a chief abbot (presently Je Khenpo) <b>who</b> <b>spends</b> six months in Tashechhoe Dzong in Thimphu and the other six months in Punakha.

The day-to-day affairs of the council are under the charge of the chief abbot.|$|E
25|$|Being a koryū, an {{old school}} with a {{traditional}} way of teaching, SMR relies on verbal instructions (as opposed to the detailed manuals of the more modern era) in order to teach {{the large majority of}} the practical applications in the art. The teacher-student relationship is very important to koryu-arts. The training forms (kata) alone do not (and cannot for practical reasons) reveal all the large number of practical applications and variations of the techniques. This can only be done properly by an experienced teacher <b>who</b> <b>spends</b> many years passing on the teachings to the student in person. Many koryū arts have deliberately hidden some, or all, applications inside their training forms, making them invisible unless properly explained by a teacher knowledgeable in the art. This was done as a way of making sure the secrets and principles could not be copied by rival schools or individuals, should an outsider accidentally (or by deliberate spying) observe the techniques in action.|$|E

25|$|Peggy Bundy (Katey Sagal)—Al's {{wife who}} is always on his case about money and refuses to clean or cook. She is a lazy, big-haired redhead <b>who</b> <b>spends</b> {{most of her time}} {{parked in front of the}} TV {{watching}} talk shows such as Oprah or robbing Al blind to go shopping; a famously inattentive mother and nagging wife who uses every opportunity to humiliate Al about his job, his meager earnings, and even sexual abilities. Her big taste for things like clothes and male strippers have run Al into debt on numerous occasions. A recurring joke in the series is Al's regret of having married Peggy in the first place; the union was forced on him at shotgun-point. Peggy's best friend is Marcy, with whom she occasionally conspires against Al. Her family is a stereotypical backwoods clan of degenerates whom she often forces the other Bundys to endure, especially her morbidly obese mother whom Al finds intolerable.|$|E
25|$|John Beck {{enlisted the}} help of two Hollywood writers, Paul Mason and Bruce Howard, to write a new screenplay. After having discussions with Beck in regard to how the film would be handled, the two wrote the American version and worked with editor Peter Zinner to remove scenes, recut others, and change the {{sequence}} of several events. Mason and Howard, in order to give the film more of an American feel, {{came up with the idea}} of inserting newly-shot footage of stage and television actor Michael Keith playing newscaster Eric Carter, a UN reporter <b>who</b> <b>spends</b> much of the time commenting on the action from the UN Headquarters via an International Communications Satellite (ICS) broadcast, and Harry Holcombe as Dr. Arnold Johnson, the head of the Museum of Natural History in New York, who tries to explain Godzilla's origin and his and Kong's motivations. The new footage was directed by Thomas Montgomery and shot in three days.|$|E

Nerima serves as a backdrop for more martial arts mayhem with the introduction of Ranma's regular rivals, such as the eternally lost Ryoga Hibiki who traveled halfway across Japan getting from the front of his house to the back, where Ranma spent three days waiting for him. Ryoga, seeking revenge on Ranma, followed him to Jusenkyo where he ultimately falls into the Spring of Drown Piglet. Now when splashed with cold water he {{takes the form of a}} little black pig. Not knowing this, Akane takes the piglet as a pet and names it P-chan, but Ranma knows and hates him for keeping this secret and taking advantage of the situation. Another rival is the nearsighted Mousse, who also falls into a cursed spring and becomes a duck when he gets wet, and finally, there is Ranma's impish grandmaster, Happosai, <b>who</b> <b>spends</b> his time stealing the underwear of schoolgirls.|$|E
