5|$|Croneman {{claims to}} be the mightiest barbarian of the {{northern}} tribes and honorary chief of the savage bezerkers of Nid. Known also as Amoron, the Wombat, he is a slayer, a reaver, a corsair, a usurper, and a conqueror. Depicted as resembling Schwarzenegger, he is also a bodybuilder with a very silly accent.

5|$|Drug {{collectors}} {{have certain}} traditions {{which may be}} accurate or may be exaggerated. Precautions are rightly taken when gathering hellebore, and men cannot dig it up for long; whereas the story that the peony must be dug up at night for fear that a woodpecker will watch and cause the man a rectal prolapse is a mere superstition. Similarly {{the idea that you}} must mark three circles around a mandrake plant <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sword,</b> and speak of the mysteries of love while cutting it, is just far-fetched.|$|E

Odaenathus warned the nephew who ignored the warning and {{repeated}} the act twice causing the king to deprive him of his horse which is a great insult in the East. The nephew threatened Odaenathus and was put in chains as a result; Hairan I asked his father to forgive his cousin and his request was granted but as the king was drinking, the nephew approached him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sword</b> and killed him along with Hairan I.

5|$|Ryse: Son of Rome is an action-adventure hack and slash {{game played}} in a third-person perspective. Players assume control of Marius Titus, a Roman general who is on a quest to avenge his murdered family. Throughout the game, players gain access to weapons {{that can be used}} to assault enemies or defend themselves. For instance, players are {{equipped}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sword</b> {{that can be used to}} strike and kill enemies, and a shield that can be used to deflect enemies' attack and break their defense. The strength of each attack can be decided by players. In addition to melee-based combat, the game features spears and javelins, which serve as ranged weapons.|$|E
5|$|The Adventure of Link has a {{more complex}} combat system than its predecessor. Armed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sword</b> and shield, Link must {{alternate}} between standing and crouching positions in order to attack enemies and defend himself; for example, the Iron Knuckle enemy changes the height of its attack and its shield depending on Link's current stance, forcing Link to change stances until {{he has a chance}} to attack safely. Link has the ability to jump, which can be used for attacking tall or airborne enemies, and can be used for evasion. Eventually, he can learn techniques for downward and upward stabs in midair.|$|E

5|$|The heavy {{infantry}} of the maniples {{were supported}} {{by a number of}} light infantry and cavalry troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion. The cavalry was drawn primarily from the richest class of equestrians. There was an additional class of troops who followed the army without specific martial roles and were deployed {{to the rear of the}} third line. Their role in accompanying the army was primarily to supply any vacancies that might occur in the maniples. The light infantry consisted of 1,200 unarmoured skirmishing troops drawn from the youngest and lower social classes. They were armed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sword</b> and a small shield, as well as several light javelins.|$|E
