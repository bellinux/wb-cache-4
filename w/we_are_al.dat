40|$|The article {{concerns}} Bulgarian statisticians ' work on {{accounting of}} national income {{within the first}} half of the 20 th century. Basic concepts of these authors are described, and aggregate data sets derived by them presented. The trend of economic growth in Bulgaria is analyzed, mainly from 1924 to 1945. The statistics of industrial and agricultural change, as well as the foreign trade activity are considered. An historical interpretation of that change is given. The historical national accounting in Bulgaria began and reached its bloom during the inter-war period, in particular from the mid- 1920 s until the end of World War 11. In fact, attempts were made to give a definition of the indicator national income and to construct rough indices of the trend of economic growth in the period up to 1945. During {{the first half of}} the 20 th century the general concept of national income was in the process of clarifying on a global scale and there was no consen-sus among economists and statisticians about it. Besides, in the 1930 s due to the circumstances of the time, economists concentrated on short-term analyses, following the sense of the Keynes's famous remark "In the long run <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>al...</b>|$|E
40|$|Subject {{to severe}} {{financial}} constraints while operating within a regime of moral panics {{driven by the}} ‘war on terrorism’, {{higher education in the}} United States faces both a legitimation crisis and a political crisis. With its increasing reliance on Pentagon and corporate interests, the academy has largely opened its doors to serving private and governmental interests and in doing so has compromised its role as a democratic public sphere. This article situates the development of the university as a militarized knowledge factory within the broader context of what I call the biopolitics of militarization and its increasing influence and power within American society after the tragic events of September 11, 2001. Highlighting and critically engaging the specific ways in which the forces of militarization are shaping various aspects of university life, this article focuses on the growth of militarized knowledge and research, the increasing development of academic programs and schools that serve military personnel, and the ongoing production of military values and subject positions on US campuses. It also charts how the alliance between the university and the national security state has undermined the university as a site of criticism, dissent and critical dialogue. Key words ■ 9 / 11 ■ America ■ higher education ■ militarism ■ military ■ neoliberalism ■ pedagogy War is the motor behind institutions and order. In the smallest of its cogs, peace is waging a secret war. To put it another way, we have to interpret the war that is going on beneath peace; peace is coded war. We are therefore at war with one another; a battlefront runs through the whole of society, continu-ously and permanently, and it is this battlefront that puts us all on one side or the other.

40|$|Using monthly panel data we solve and estimate, using maximum {{likelihood}} techniques, an explicitly dynamic model of criminal behav-ior where current criminal activity adversely affects future employ-ment outcomes. This acts as “dynamic deterrence ” to crime: {{the threat of}} future adverse effects on employment payoffs when caught committing crimes reduces the incentive to commit them. We show that this dynamic deterrence effect is strong in the data. Hence, policies which weaken dynamic deterrence will be less effec-tive in fighting crime. This suggests that prevention is more powerful than redemption since the latter weakens dynamic deterrence as antic-ipated future redemption allows criminals {{to look forward to}} negating the consequences of their crimes. Static models of criminal behavior neglect this and hence sole reliance on them can result in misleading policy analysis. ∗We are grateful to Steve Collins of the FBI for many useful conversations. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>als...</b>|$|R
40|$|Many lakes, {{coastal zones}} and oceans are {{directly}} or indirectly influenced by human activities. Through the outlet of {{a vast amount of}} substances in the air and water, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> changing the natural conditions on local and global levels. Remote sensing sensors, on satellites or airplanes, can collect image data, providing the user with information about the depicted area, object or phenomenon. Three different applications are discussed in this thesis. In the first part, we have used a bio-optical model to derive information about water quality parameters from remote sensing data collected over Swedish lakes. In the second part, remote sensing data have been used to locate and map wastewater plumes from pulp and paper industries along the east coast of Sweden. Finally, in the third part, we have investigated to what extent satellite data can be used to monitor coral reefs and detect coral bleaching. Regardless of application, {{it is important to understand}} the limitations of this technique.

40|$|In this paper, {{we apply}} basic {{principles}} from {{the domain of}} design and architecture to choices made by employees saving for retirement. Three of {{the basic principles of}} design we apply are: (1) there is no neutral design, (2) design does matter, and (3) many of the seemingly minor design elements could matter as well. Applying these principles to the domain of retirement savings, we show that the design of retirement saving vehicles has a large effect on saving rates and investment elections, and that some of the minor details involved in the architecture of retirement plans could have dramatic effects on savings behavior. We conclude our paper by discussing how lessons learned from the design of objects could be applied to help people make better decisions, which we refer to as “choice architecture. ” * Benartzi is grateful for financial support from Reish Luftman McDaniel & Reicher and Vanguard. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>als...</b>|$|R

40|$|Coal {{exploration}} {{projects are}} focused to accurately predict the geology of a coal field in a cost-effective manner. More geologic data generally yields a better geological {{model of the}} coal field. Advances in geophysical methods may provide tools to supplement traditional methods of coal exploration. Two seismic methods: 1) multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW), and 2) shear wave (SH-wave) analysis were evaluated to determine their usefulness as coal exploration tools. The MASW method was useful to model the relief on the bedrock surface. Since the geophone spacing utilized was 5 feet (1. 5 m) a very accurate mapping of the unconsolidated material thickness was generated as compared to a typical coal exploration program. The method was not useful in modeling below the bedrock surface due to poor vertical resolution and limited depth of penetration. SH-wave survey was able to accurately model bedrock down to 150 to 200 feet (45 to 61 meters) below the surface. We relied on the amplitude change or the tuning effect to image existing thin coal layers less than 5 ft (1. 5 m). Through {{the use of this}} method <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>als...</b>|$|R

40|$|Every year 400, 000 {{entrepreneurs}} {{fail and}} 20 % of them file for bankruptcy. Thus the personal bankruptcy law {{has important implications}} for entrepreneurship. The option to declare bankruptcy encourages entrepreneurship through providing insurance since entrepreneurs may default in bad times. However, perfectly competitive financial intermediaries take the possibility of default into account and they charge higher interest rates which reflect these default probabilities. Thus personal bankruptcy provides insurance at the cost of worsening credit conditions. We develop a quantitative general equilibrium model of occupational choice that examines the effects of the US personal bankruptcy law on entrepreneurship. The model explicitly incorporates the US legislative framework and replicates empirical features of the US economy regarding entrepreneurship, wealth distribution and bankruptcy filings by entrepreneurs. Our quantitative evaluation shows that the current US bankruptcy law is too lenient. It provides too much insurance at the expense of worsened credit conditions. According to our simulations, halving the wealth exemption level from the current one would increase entrepreneurship, the median firm size, welfare and social mobility without increasing inequality. However, eliminating the possibility of bankruptcy completely would reduce welfare and entrepreneurship.

40|$|Direct {{evidence}} for the spatial correlation between individual particle traversals and localized CDKN 1 A response induced by high-LET radiation In a recent study, we showed that heavy ion irradiation of human fibroblasts leads to an extremely localized nuclear response of the CDKN 1 A (p 21) protein (1).
