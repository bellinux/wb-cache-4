25|$|On 19 December 1996, {{on the eve}} {{of general}} elections, the Minister for the Environment Brendan Howlin from the Labour Party of the Rainbow Government of Fine Gael–Labour Party–Democratic Left {{announced}} that the <b>water</b> <b>charge</b> was going {{to be replaced by a}} new system in which motor tax collected in each area would be the source for local council funding.|$|E
25|$|In July 2004 the City Council {{approved}} {{an automatic}} tariff adjustment (ATA) {{every six months}} {{over a five-year period}} to allow the provincial government to pay its arrears to the private operators. The water tariff adjustment formula foresaw that increases of the <b>water</b> <b>charge</b> would be fully passed on to consumers, in addition to any changes in the financial requirements of the asset holding company PAM Jaya and the regulatory body.|$|E
25|$|In Cape Town water tariffs for {{the first}} block beyond free basic water are {{slightly}} lower than in Johannesburg at R4.55 until 10 cubic meters, and the next tranche at R9.7 is broader than in Johannesburg covering until 20 cubic meters per month, with R23,42 charged beyond 50 cubic meters, resulting in a steeper tariff structure. The water bill for 10 cubic meters per month is R18. The sewer charge is 70% of the <b>water</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} councils decided to {{introduce}} <b>water</b> <b>charges,</b> while others such as Dublin initially decided against introducing them. After <b>water</b> <b>charges</b> {{were introduced in}} Dublin in 1994, an anti-water charges campaign was initiated and included demonstrations and a boycott of the new charges. The city threatened to cut the water supply {{to those who did}} not pay. After lengthy court battles, some non-paying users were cut off, but the non-payment of <b>water</b> <b>charges</b> continued.|$|R
30|$|The COWSO is {{very active}} {{and close to}} the {{groundwater}} users. It has established a system of paying <b>water</b> <b>charges</b> per bucket, fetching water {{in the presence of the}} water agent at every water point who collects <b>water</b> <b>charges.</b> Generally, the COWSO oversees all groundwater governance activities properly.|$|R
5000|$|There was public disquiet about Singapore <b>water</b> <b>charges,</b> {{which were}} the highest of any town in Malaya, on account of [...] "the high {{overhead}} cost of the Johore supply scheme". For {{a discussion of the}} impact of <b>water</b> <b>charges</b> on the poor in Singapore in 1936 (who were considered by one commentator as wasteful in their use of water), a comparison of <b>water</b> <b>charges</b> in other towns and cities in Malaya and a discussion on why the water department should not be a profit-oriented trading department, see extensive footnote.|$|R
25|$|Water {{privatisation}} in Jakarta {{began when}} the British water company Thames Water entered into {{an agreement with the}} son of then-President Suharto in 1993 to obtain a water concession. Under the influence of the French water company Suez, however, the government decided to split the city's service area between the two companies. The government awarded Thames Water and Suez each a concession for one half of the city without competitive bidding. The contracts foresaw <b>water</b> <b>charge</b> increases that would allow the companies to earn a comfortable 22 percent rate of return. However, only two months after the contracts were signed, the Indonesian rupiah massively lost in value due to the East Asian financial crisis, and President Suharto was toppled. The concessions survived, but the government imposed a tariff freeze and the contracts had to be renegotiated to reduce their targets. In 2006 Suez sold half and Thames Water all its shares to Indonesian investors.|$|E
25|$|Deficit between water {{tariffs and}} water charges. There are two {{problems}} with this charging system: First, the <b>water</b> <b>charge</b> is indexed to inflation and {{is supposed to be}} automatically increased every six months, while water tariff increases have to be approved by the City Council. In the aftermath of the East Asian Crisis, the City Council froze the water tariff, thus creating a deficit for the government-owned Asset Holding Company Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya (PAM Jaya) as early as the second half of 1998. Second, the more poor people were connected the lower the average tariff collected would become because of the tariff structure. The public contract partner of the private companies, PAM Jaya, however, receives higher revenues from commercial customers and wealthier residential customers since these pay higher tariffs than the poor residential customers. The more poor people are connected by the private operators, the greater the deficit of the public holding company would become, since for each new poor customer it had to pay a charge to the private companies than was higher than the tariff paid by the customer. PAM Jaya thus actually discourages the private companies to connect the poor to the network by seeking a “balanced composition of connections” in order not to further increase the burden on the budget of the province of Jakarta. Indeed, between 1998 and 2004 only 25% of TPJ's new connections were in the two poorest categories, while 60% of existing customers in 2003 were in these categories. As a result of these factors, PAM Jaya has not fully paid the charges to the operators and has accumulated arrears to them. These arrears could reach Rupiahs 18.2 trillion (1.9bn USD) {{until the end of the}} contracts in 2022, if the water tariff remains frozen from 2007 until 2022.|$|E
