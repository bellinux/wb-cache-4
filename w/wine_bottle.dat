5|$|When Bart is sent by {{his captors}} into town {{to buy a}} case of antifreeze, he sees a gendarme and tries to ask for help, but the gendarme does not {{understand}} English and only gives Bart a piece of candy. Bart walks away, despairing over his own stupidity, then suddenly begins speaking French to himself. Realizing he has become fluent in the language, he runs back to the gendarme and tells him about the winemakers, who are swiftly arrested and Bart finishes his stay in France being hailed as a hero. He is awarded a medal for his bravery and he is kissed by a French beauty queen. Back in Springfield, Adil is caught by the FBI, forcing him to be deported back to Albania {{in exchange for their}} own child spy. Bart returns to his family, bringing them gifts from France. Back at home trying out the gifts, Homer has difficulty opening a <b>wine</b> <b>bottle,</b> but is pleased to hear Bart speak French, oblivious that Bart has just called him a buffoon.|$|E
5|$|While {{the local}} townspeople believe all Carno's wives {{died of natural}} causes or accidentally, Adrienne learns through a series of visions that he murdered them in {{grotesque}} ways. Hortencia (Christine Armond), who avoided Zoltan's abuse by secluding herself in her greenhouse, is stabbed with gardening tools and suffocated with mulch. Victoria (Holley Chant), an alcoholic, is killed when Zoltan impales her eye with a <b>wine</b> <b>bottle</b> during an argument. An overly talkative third wife, Leonora (Dana Moody), has her mouth gagged and her neck contorted in a torture device. Finally, the food-loving Regina (Wanda Smith) is force-fed animal entrails through a funnel until she chokes to death. Harriet performs a séance for Adrienne, revealing {{in the form of a}} green ectoplasm the spirit of Carno before he had been possessed. He reveals that the previously contained evil spirit has been released, and urges Adrienne to trap it once again.|$|E

25|$|The <b>wine</b> <b>bottle</b> {{has been}} given certain shapes {{dedicated}} to wine. The most emblematic is the bottle of sparkling wine: because of the pressure inside it is a fairly thick glass.

25|$|Vouvray {{produces}} {{more than a}} million cases of wine a year. The traditional style of winemaking in Vouvray is a minimalist approach, often using neutral fermentation vessel such as stainless steel and not submitting the wine to malolactic fermentation. While some winemakers are experimenting with oak, very few wines are made with new oak. Vouvrays are usually bottled early and expected to age in the <b>wine</b> <b>bottle.</b> Sparkling wines are made according to the traditional method and can either be pétillant (semi-sparkling) or mousseux (fully sparkling).|$|E

25|$|Between {{midnight and}} 8:00a.m. on June 3, 1961, a {{burglary}} {{occurred at the}} Bay Harbor Pool Room in Panama City, Florida. An unknown person broke a door, smashed a cigarette machine and a record player, and stole money from a cash register. Later that day, a witness {{reported that he had}} seen Clarence Earl Gideon in the poolroom at around 5:30 that morning, leaving with a <b>wine</b> <b>bottle</b> and money in his pockets. Based on this accusation alone, the police arrested Gideon and charged him with breaking and entering with intent to commit petty larceny.|$|E
25|$|Pepe {{incorporates}} {{some elements}} of traditional winemaking, including crushing his organically grown grapes by foot similar to the traditional Port wine tradition of using a large stone vats called lagares to tread on wine grapes. He also shuns {{the use of any}} fining and filtration aids as well as the use of the sulfur dioxide for preserving and protecting the wine oxidation. However, instead of using oak barrels or stainless steel fermentation tanks, Pepe ferments and ages everything in glass (from using glass lined fermentation vessels, to storing the wine in bottles). When the wines are ready to be released, they are decanted off their sediments and repackaged in a new <b>wine</b> <b>bottle.</b>|$|E

25|$|Less {{than half}} of the tartaric acid found in grapes is free standing, with the {{majority}} of the concentration present as potassium acid salt. During fermentation, these tartrates bind with the lees, pulp debris and precipitated tannins and pigments. While some variance among grape varieties and wine regions exists, generally about half of the deposits are soluble in the alcoholic mixture of wine. The crystallization of these tartrates can happen at unpredictable times, and in a <b>wine</b> <b>bottle</b> may appear like broken glass, though they are in fact harmless. Winemakers will often put the wine through cold stabilization, where it is exposed to temperatures below freezing to encourage the tartrates to crystallize and precipitate out of the wine, or electrodialysis which removes the tartrates via a membrane process.|$|E
25|$|The {{roots of}} the modern Champagne {{industry}} were laid during the Industrial Revolution which saw vast leaps in understanding the method of making sparkling wine and improvements in the technology needed to make production more financially feasible. The French scientist Jean-Antoine Chaptal popularized the understanding that Champagne sparkled because it was sealed in a bottle before fermentation was complete. He further noted {{that it was the}} sugar in the wine that facilitated this fermentation process resulting in bubbles. Along with the bubbles came intense pressure from the carbon dioxide gas that could result in the bottles exploding. The disturbance caused by one bottle's disintegration could cause a chain reaction, with it being routine for cellars to lose 20–90% of their bottles to instability. The British method of coal fired glassmaking contributed to stronger wine bottles being available that could withstand the pressure of the carbon dioxide gas better. In the 1830s, a pharmacist from Châlons-sur-Marne named André François outlined formulas with precise measurements of how much sugar is needed to make a wine sparkle without producing more pressure than the <b>wine</b> <b>bottle</b> could withstand. Corking machines and improved corks made sealing the wine easier with less opportunity for the precious gas to seep out of the bottle.|$|E

500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "Long, Long, Long" [...] {{during a}} period that marked his {{emergence}} as a prolific songwriter, coinciding with {{his return to the}} guitar after two years of studying the Indian sitar. His musical inspiration for the song was [...] "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands" [...] by Bob Dylan, while the understated arrangement reflects the influence of the Band's 1968 album Music from Big Pink. The Beatles recorded the song in London {{towards the end of the}} troubled sessions for the White Album. Sequenced to follow the heavy rock-styled [...] "Helter Skelter", the otherwise gentle and meditative track ends with a partly improvised segment, which was inspired by the eerie sound of a <b>wine</b> <b>bottle</b> vibrating on a speaker in the recording studio.|$|E
500|$|The final song on side {{three is}} Harrison's [...] "Long, Long, Long", {{part of the}} chord {{progression}} for which he took from Bob Dylan's [...] "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands". MacDonald describes the song as Harrison's [...] "touching token of exhausted, relieved reconciliation with God" [...] and considered it to be his [...] "finest moment on The Beatles". The recording session for the basic track {{was one of the}} longest the Beatles ever undertook, running from the afternoon of 7 October through the night until 7am the next day. McCartney played Hammond organ on the track, and an [...] "eerie rattling" [...] effect at the end was created by a note causing a <b>wine</b> <b>bottle</b> on top of the organ's Leslie speaker to resonate.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} {{on the history of}} ambient music, Mark Prendergast cites [...] "Long, Long, Long" [...] as a ballad [...] "noteworthy for its Ambient production". The idea {{for the end of the}} song was {{inspired}} by the sound created by a <b>wine</b> <b>bottle</b> sitting on a Leslie speaker, through which the organ was connected. Whenever McCartney played a certain note on the keyboard, the bottle began to vibrate, producing an eerie clattering sound that the Beatles decided to incorporate in their subsequent performances of the track. To compound the effect on the selected take, Starr played a fast snare drum roll and Harrison vocalised a prolonged, high-pitched wail. While noting the [...] "palpable spiritual longing" [...] conveyed in the song, Chris Gerard of PopMatters describes this coda as a [...] "weird spectral ending, with Harrison wailing like a wounded ghost while the band members rattle their instruments ominously".|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, {{following}} the sale, the Cameron operation moved to Kalama and was re-christened the Cameron Family Glass Packaging LLC, {{with the goal}} of producing <b>wine</b> <b>bottles</b> for the <b>wine</b> industry in the Western United States. There, the company built a <b>wine</b> <b>bottling</b> plant in Washington State. The 175000 sq ft facility, which cost $109M to build, became the first new glass plant to exclusively produce <b>wine</b> <b>bottles</b> built in the nation in over 30 years. It became the largest such plant to be operated on an [...] "eco-friendly" [...] basis, with hydroelectric-powered electric furnace using the Northwest waterways of the Columbia River. The plant provided <b>wine</b> <b>bottles</b> for a number of Washington wines, but had to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2009 due to a furnace failure that caused $12M in damages within a month of startup. Production was later resumed under new ownership through a court-ordered sale in 2010.|$|R

500|$|A decade later, a New York Times {{reporter}} {{visiting the}} zoo noted that [...] "...an Asiatic Black Bear {{lay on a}} rock {{a short distance from}} a guard rail. A shattered <b>wine</b> <b>bottle,</b> a cracked stick, and a number of empty beer cans were strewn about the ground a few feet in front of him. 'How many times have I seen a bear lift his foot and leave a bloody foot print?' said John Kinzig, a park supervisor at the Prospect Park Zoo. 'Vandalism is a major problem, and deterioration is overtaking repairs.'" [...] Activists were pressing for major renovations of the zoo, which, in 1983, was rated by the Humane Society of the United States as one of the [...] "10 worst" [...] zoos in the country. Others felt that a zoo was not in keeping with the original design of Prospect Park and urged its complete removal from the grounds. A fatal accident of an 11-year-old boy scaling the fence to the polar bear pit only served to underscore difficulties with the fifty-year-old facility.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} by clay animation using character models each {{about the size of}} a <b>wine</b> <b>bottle.</b> The models were first constructed using plasticine before pouring Carbog, a solid material used by mechanics, into moulds to form the bodies. They were then painted to appear like plasticine, and real plasticine around wire was used for the arms. Elliot said he chose to use Carbog since models made from just plasticine would require more maintenance. Some characters had replaceable mouths made of hardened Sculpey clay that were attached magnetically to the faces to reflect different facial expressions; Harvie's model had more than 30 separate mouth shapes. The design of the models was influenced by Elliot's tremor, since he needed them to be relatively large and easy to manipulate. He made the models' eyes particularly large [...] "to fully express the character's emotion". He intentionally left fingerprints in the plasticine when manipulating the models to remind the audience that [...] "what they're seeing is tangible, tactile and it's not generated through a computer". He was assisted by Sophie Raymond and Michael Bazeley in constructing and modelling the characters. The sets were largely constructed from wood.|$|E
