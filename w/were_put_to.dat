5|$|In 1907, {{members of}} the Mvog Ada sublineage revolted against the colonial {{government}} over Atangana's appointment as their official interpreter. The plot included a conspiracy to poison Atangana, but word leaked to him. He informed his masters, and on 11 April, six plotters <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death and two others imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{provisions}} of the Hague Convention, industrial firms in the Netherlands, France and Belgium <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> work producing war materiel for the occupying German military.

5|$|Taqiya ("dissimulation") was {{practiced by}} some Bábís. It was {{justified}} {{by some as}} a response to the often violent oppression the community faced. However, prominent Bábí leaders never encouraged individuals to practice it; and some who had practiced taqiyya later abandoned it, declared themselves openly, and <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death.|$|E
5|$|The {{inquiry into}} the {{disaster}} opened on 2 January 1914 with Richard Redmayne, the Chief Inspector of Mines, as the commissioner; he was assisted by two assessors, Evan Williams, {{the chairman of the}} South Wales and Monmouthshire Coal Owners Association, and Robert Smillie, the president of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. The inquiry ran for three days before being adjourned to allow for the coroner's inquest to run at Senghenydd. It reopened on 27 January and ran until 21 February. Over the 13 days it heard evidence, 21,837 questions <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> 50 witnesses. The coroner's inquest chaired by David Rees lasted for 5 days from 5 January 1914. A total of 9,000 questions <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> 50 witnesses, and the jury returned verdicts of accidental death.|$|E
5|$|A {{range of}} the fortifications were {{opened to the public}} in the post-war years. Deal, Hurst, Pendennis and Portland opened in the 1950s, and Southsea in 1967. Calshot {{followed}} in the 1980s, Camber after a long period of restoration work in 1994, and Sandsfoot reopened following repair work in 2012. Visitor numbers vary across the sites; Southsea Castle, for example, received over 90,000 visitors in 2011–12. Other forts <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> different uses: Netley was first used a nursing home, and then converted into private flats; Brownsea became a corporate hotel for the employees of the John Lewis Partnership; and Sandgate was restored in the 1970s to form a private home.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, Wheeler {{recruited}} Way {{to work on}} the Manhattan Project at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Working with physicist Alvin Weinberg, Way analyzed {{neutron flux}} data from Enrico Fermi's early nuclear reactor designs to see whether {{it would be possible to}} create a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. These calculations <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> use in the construction of Chicago Pile-1. Afterwards, she examined the problem of nuclear poisoning of reactors by certain fission products. With physicist Eugene Wigner she developed the Way-Wigner approximation for fission product decay.|$|E
5|$|In England, motte-and-bailey {{earthworks}} <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> various uses over later years; in some cases, mottes {{were turned}} into garden {{features in the}} 18th century, or reused as military defences during the Second World War. Today, almost no mottes of motte-and-bailey castles remain in regular use in Europe, {{with one of the}} few exceptions being that at Windsor Castle, converted for the storage of royal documents. The landscape of northern Europe remains scattered with their earthworks, and many form popular tourist attractions as part of the European heritage industry.|$|E
5|$|In the convict era, {{particularly}} during Hampton's term as governor, misbehaving prisoners were punished with flogging, solitary confinement, {{and working in}} chain gangs at gunpoint. Particularly difficult prisoners <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> work hand pumping groundwater into the prison's reservoir. Known as cranking, it was especially despised by the prisoners. Staff disliked giving the lashings – in 1851, {{out of a total}} of 400 lashings ordered, 150 were remitted as the superintendent could not find anyone to undertake the task. The role was so disliked that inducements were offered, including extra pay or improved lodgings.|$|E

5|$|In this period, Germany {{was still}} in a dire {{economic}} situation as millions were unemployed and the balance of trade deficit was daunting. Hitler knew that reviving the economy was vital. In 1934, using deficit spending, public works projects were undertaken. A total of 1.7 million Germans <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> work on the projects in 1934 alone. Average wages both per hour and per week began to rise.|$|E
5|$|Meermin {{set sail}} from Madagascar on 20 January 1766, {{heading to the}} Cape Colony. Two days into the trip, Johann Godfried Krause, the ship's chief merchant, persuaded the captain, Gerrit Cristoffel Muller, to release the Malagasy slaves from their {{shackles}} and thus avoid attrition by death and disease in their overcrowded living conditions. The Malagasy <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> working the ship and entertaining the crew. In mid-February, Krause ordered the Malagasy to clean some Madagascan weapons, which they subsequently used to seize the ship {{in an attempt to}} regain their freedom; Krause was among the first of the crew to be killed, and Muller was stabbed three times but survived.|$|E
5|$|Royal {{artisans}} {{were sometimes}} responsible for sculpting stelae; {{in some cases}} these sculptors were actually the sons of kings. In other cases {{it is likely that}} captive artisans from defeated cities <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> work raising stelae for the victors, as evidenced by the sculptural style of one city appearing upon monuments of its conqueror soon after its defeat. This appears to have been the case in Piedras Negras where Stela12 depicting war captives submitting to the victorious king is carved in the style of Pomoná, the defeated city. Archaeologists believe that this may also have been the case with Quiriguá after its surprise defeat of its overlord Copán.|$|E
5000|$|A motion <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> the meeting, {{that the}} [...] "lease is {{injurious}} to both companies, {{and that it}} <b>is</b> desirable <b>to</b> <b>put</b> an end <b>to</b> it".|$|R
5000|$|No {{sentence}} {{carries with}} it {{any change in the}} civil status of the convict's family. The Pentateuchal law provides (Deut. xxiv. 16), [...] "The parents shall not <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death for the children, neither shall the children <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death for the parents; every man shall <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death for his own sins," [...] and rabbinic jurisprudence follows this principle both to the letter and in spirit. Nor is a sentence attended by confiscation of the convict's goods. All his possessions descend to his legal heirs (Tosef., Sanh. iv. 6; Sanh. 27b, 48b; see Confiscation).|$|R

5|$|Seven {{thousand}} carvers {{and three}} thousand volunteers <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> {{work for the}} construction Akshardham. With over 6,000 tons of pink sandstone coming from Rajasthan, workshop sites were set up around places within the state. Amongst the carvers were local farmers and fifteen hundred tribal women who had suffered from a drought and received economic gain due to this work. The initial stone cutting was done by machine, while the detailed carvings were done by hand. Every night, over one hundred trucks were sent to Akshardham, where four thousand workers and volunteers operated on the construction site.|$|E
5|$|The French {{authorities}} imprisoned Long {{and many}} of his supporters, who openly admitted their aim of overthrowing French authorities at the trial. During the 1916 Cochinchina uprisings against French rule, many of Long's supporters attempted to break him out of jail. The French easily repelled the attack on the jail, decimating Long's movement. Following the attempted breakout, Long and his key supporters <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> death. Many of the remnants of his support base went on to join what later became the Cao Đài, a major religious sect in Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|To the east, the Washington, D.C. {{area was}} {{particularly}} affected, and considerable flooding {{was reported in}} the Virginias and Maryland. Much of the grounds of the Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD were flooded and the Midshipmen <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> work the next day cleaning up debris. New Jersey escaped major flooding as the high tide was low enough, but to the south in Chesapeake Bay, the majority of crab pots were destroyed. Hazel lost a considerable amount of moisture when crossing the Allegheny Mountains, which raised rivers and streams in the Pittsburgh area significantly above the flood mark. In Pennsylvania, the winds were still high enough to unroof several homes.|$|E

50|$|McGarvie's {{preferred}} process involved asking all the parliaments of Australia {{to establish}} model development committees, which would design very detailed models.

5|$|Using deficit spending, a government-sponsored {{programme}} {{for economic}} renewal focused on public works projects. In public work projects of 1934, 1.7 million Germans immediately <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> work, which {{gave them an}} income and social benefits. The most famous of the projects was the high speed roadway, the Reichsautobahn, known as the German autobahns. Other capital construction projects included hydroelectric facilities such as the Rur Dam, water supplies such as Zillierbach Dam, and transportation hubs such as Zwickau Hauptbahnhof. Over the next five years, unemployment plummeted and average wages both per hour and per week rose.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war Norsk Hydro had {{a strong}} liquidity, while the Green Revolution and {{increased}} industrialization of agriculture in Europe boomed the demand for the products; from 1945 to 1955 production increased eightfold. The increased transport was a heavy burden on the two steamships, and in 1953 Norsk Transport ordered MF Storegut, a diesel powered ship of 1119 gross tonnes. She was launched on 25 May 1956, and the two older ferries <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> reserve duty in the meantime. A number of upgrades were made to the line, and the two locomotives 9 and 10 were bought in 1958. This was followed by the three diesel locomotives 20, 21 and 22 from Henschel. In 1966 two NSB El 1 locomotives were bought, and the voltage on the line increased from 10 to 15 kV.|$|E
5|$|Ali {{refused to}} negotiate, gained {{the backing of}} Salibi, and the two {{defeated}} their father, who had since demobilized his troops and was relying on local civilian volunteers from Acre. When Zahir re-mobilized his Maghrebi mercenaries in Acre he launched an offensive and defeated Ali, who subsequently fled Deir Hanna in October. Out of sympathy for Ali's children, who remained in the fortress village, he pardoned Ali on the condition he pay 12,500 piasters and 25 Arabian horses for the fortress. By December 1767, Zahir's intra-family disputes <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>to</b> rest for several years (until 1774–75), and through the intercession of Uthman, a close and enduring alliance was established between Zahir and Sheikh Nasif.|$|E
