Horn's mental condition seems to deteriorate, and he begins to take the case personally, leading Black to doubt his ability.|$|E

The film depicts the story of an ancient Siamese king who only goes to war after he's been attacked.|$|E

Berkowitz stated in a series of meetings with his special court-appointed psychiatrist David Abrahamsen that he had long contemplated murder to get revenge at a <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> felt had rejected and hurt him. Berkowitz claimed he felt particular anger due to his lack of success with women, and thus singled out attractive young women as victims.|$|E

A telephone exchange was added in 1907. The Hobart GPO is probably most famous internationally for being the place where Roald Amundsen, in front of a large gathering of locals, telegraphed the news, on 7 March 1912, around the <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had successfully reached the South Pole the previous December.|$|E

25|$|In 1934, Hitler named Ribbentrop Special Commissioner for Disarmament. In {{his early}} years, Hitler's goal {{in foreign affairs}} was to persuade the <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wished to reduce {{military}} spending by making idealistic but very vague disarmament offers (in the 1930s, the term disarmament was used to describe arms-limitation agreements). At the same time, the Germans always resisted making concrete arms-limitations proposals, and they went ahead with increased military spending on grounds that other powers would not take up German arms-limitation offers. Ribbentrop was tasked with ensuring that the world remained convinced that Germany sincerely wanted an arms-limitation treaty while also ensuring that no such treaty was ever developed.|$|E
25|$|Eddie Carbone is {{the central}} {{character}} in A View from the Bridge and is not positioned as the protagonist or the antagonist. He is a longshoreman who lives with his wife, Beatrice, and his 17-year-old niece, Catherine. When his family from Italy, Rodolpho and Marco, migrate illegally and begin to live with him, the small <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> operates in is disrupted. Eddie becomes conflicted and ultimately self-destructive over his sexual attraction to his niece and her involvement {{with one of his}} Italian tenants. His character arc culminates as he becomes an informer to the immigration authorities which leads to a confrontation with one of his tenants. Marco labels him as an informer and Eddie perceives this as a permanent blemish on his good name. This confrontation ultimately leads to his death, leaving Eddie as one of Miller's examples of tragic figures.|$|E
25|$|The {{acclaimed}} German (later naturalized Swiss) writer Hermann Hesse wrote a {{short story}} in 1915 in which a young man is carried by a giant bird across a mountain range to a distant plain that is to him like another world. Strange News from Another Star tells of the horror experienced by this youth who has volunteered to go to find flowers to bury the dead from an earthquake; flowers that are required during the ceremony of the burial of the dead, in this young man's world, to ease a smooth transition into the next life. In order to speed his journey, he is carried across the mountains by this giant bird, but finds himself in a land where war has left the dead unburied and uncared for, a brutal world, perhaps {{like that of the}} trenches of World War I, a <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> can only believe is from his distant past. Hesse later went on to write the acclaimed novel Siddhartha, exploring the life of Buddha.|$|E

25|$|Parker {{was looking}} ahead to the future when he persuaded Presley to sign up as a regular soldier. Presley had wanted to join Special Services, {{allowing}} {{him the opportunity to}} continue to perform {{while at the same time}} getting an easier ride than other soldiers. Parker, on the other hand, was fully aware that any special treatment given to Presley would instantly be used against him in the media and by those who disliked his style of music. If Presley could show the <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was just the same as any other young man, Parker told him, then more people would be likely to accept him and his music. Parker was also afraid that any attempt to block Presley from being drafted would result in a more detailed look into his own service record. He also realized that it would be a great opportunity to promote Presley by having the media witness his induction day, including the Army haircut that would see the most famous hair style in the world destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} he joins the Legion, Superboy's life is {{threatened}} when a Green Kryptonite meteor falls to Earth, but his life is saved by a Smallville farm boy named Lex Luthor, {{who also happens to}} be a science prodigy. The two boys become fast friends, and Superboy builds Lex a fully stocked laboratory to allow him to conduct his experiments. Lex uses the lab to search for a cure for Superboy's weakness to Kryptonite. Just after Lex discovers the cure, a fire breaks out in his lab. When Superboy puts out the fire, the antidote is destroyed, along with a protoplasmic life form that Lex created, and Lex also loses all his hair. Lex blames Superboy for destroying his experiment and his hair loss, accusing the Boy of Steel of jealousy over his brilliance. Lex swears that he will prove to the <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is superior to Superboy. Lex does this by trying to implement a series of scientific quality-of-life improvements for Smallville's residents; however, each invention of Lex's winds up backfiring, requiring Superboy to intervene. This series of setbacks results in Lex dedicating his life to destroying Superboy. In the years that follow, Lex becomes Superboy's (and then Superman's) archfoe. Superboy soon acquires a small rogues gallery of recurring villains, including Lex.|$|E
500|$|Eliot's Simeon appears {{similar to}} Dante's {{depiction}} of Virgil in the Divine Comedy, as [...] "the seer who can see only so far; the precursor who cannot enter the <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> makes possible". Virgil, in the Divine Comedy, leads Dante through Hell (Inferno) and Purgatory (Purgatorio), but cannot guide him into Paradise (Paradiso). In this context, Virgil {{was a symbol}} of non-Christian philosophy and humanities could not help Dante any further in his approach to God. [...] In Eliot's depiction, Simeon will never know the Christian culture he prophesizes, sensing [...] "the birth-pangs of a <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will never occupy".|$|E

500|$|In {{more recent}} times the poet Papanasam Sivan (1890–1973) {{composed}} four songs which describe Bhikshatana. In [...] "Picchaikku Vandiro", Sivan wonders why Shiva roams as beggar and muses {{that it may}} be because Parvati is asking for jewels or his son Ganesha is asking for modak (sweets), or perhaps just to show the <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> looks fabulous, even as a mendicant.

500|$|Martin set the Ice and Fire {{story in}} a {{secondary}} world inspired by Tolkien's writing. Unlike Tolkien, who created entire languages, mythologies, and histories for Middle-earth long before writing The Lord of the Rings, Martin usually starts with a rough sketch of an imaginary <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> improvises into a workable fictional setting along the way. He described his writing as coming from a subconscious level in [...] "almost a daydreaming process", and his stories, which have a mythic rather than a scientific core, draw from emotion instead of rationality. Martin employs maps and a cast list topping 60 pages in the fourth volume, but keeps most information in his mind. His imagined backstory remains subject to change until published, and only the novels count as canon. Martin {{does not intend to}} publish his private notes after the series is finished.|$|E
