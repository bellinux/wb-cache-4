5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} {{because what we}} <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> in such {{a long line of}} musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E

When we put that record out, we knew what we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> illegal, but {{we thought it was}} gonna be such an underground record, nobody would ever hear about it. So the first thing that shocked us is that British rock papers gave a big review.|$|E

According to Madden, the Oakland victory in the Heidi Game [...] "was kind of {{the start of the}} Raiders being a great team. One of the things we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> getting these fantastic come-from-behind things...We didn't even know about the Heidi thing until we read about it the next day." [...] Namath noted, [...] "When I remember that game, it brings to mind the revenge factor we had against them going into the championship game. We paid them back then", to which Madden chuckled, [...] "He's full of crap." ...|$|E

No health professional should be put on trial for looking after injured and dying people." [...] The U.K.-based Royal College of Nursing wrote to the Bahraini government on the health workers' behalf, as well as sending them a direct video message of support in which General Secretary Peter Carter said, [...] "All you <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> your job.

500|$|For the {{sequences}} {{involving the}} terraforming {{of the city}} Metropolis, Double Negative handled the visual effects for the sequence. In order to construct a Metropolis that seemed convincing and realistic, Double Negative utilized Esri's CityEngine to help procedurally deliver the city. [...] "That was a much more sci-fi based role," [...] said Double Negative visual effects supervisor Ged Wright, “so we took {{what they had done}} and extended it a great deal. The work we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> based around the Downtowns for New York, L.A. and Chicago and that gave us the building volumes for heights. We’d skin those volumes with kit parts, but most of it then had to fall down! So we had to rig it for destruction and use it for other aspects of the work as well." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{paramedic}} {{also said}} police allowed the first ambulances that reached Pearl Roundabout to pass safely, while some security personnel captured videos, {{but when the}} ambulances moved out carrying casualties security forces had targeted the vehicles. He said: [...] "Later Bahrain T.V. showed only the scenes where they allowed us to pass in order to mislead the public opinion. I personally heard orders given to security forces via their communication devices to target, threat and delay paramedics {{as long as they}} can. Security forces dealt with us as if we were defendants and partners to protesters who wanted to hide them, whereas what we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> a professional and humane duty {{that has nothing to do}} with our political position." [...] When the block was lifted in the late morning till noon, paramedics did not find any casualties to take back to the SMC at Pearl Roundabout, despite seeing handcuffed protesters being stomped on by police when they arrived.|$|E

500|$|Through a {{collaboration}} with science consultant André Bormanis, the producers established the Phage as a bacteriophage. During a behind-the-scenes feature {{included on the}} DVD release of the show's second season, Bromanis explained that the writers and producers paid close attention to imagining a virus that could believably almost exterminate an entire species. Both Piller and Braga responded positively to Taylor's concept of the Vidiians. Piller viewed the idea of [...] "an alien culture who are a civilized people who are forced to do uncivilized things in order to survive" [...] as a compelling plot point. Braga agreed with Piller's assessment, saying: [...] "Very rarely do you stumble on something that has real resonance." [...] Freelance writer Skye Dent, who had helped with the original development of the Vidiians, felt that pride characterized the alien species. She explained: [...] "ven though {{they knew what they}} <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong in terms of the actual action, they were very confident that because they were culturally superior, they were totally justified in killing people and taking their organs".|$|E
500|$|A {{low quality}} snippet of [...] "Frozen" [...] was leaked by fans on January 23, 1998, after it debuted on radio in Singapore, and posted {{it on the}} Internet. They said {{they knew what they}} <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> wrong, but that they hoped it would simply {{generate}} interest from Madonna. The song was played on the US radios, including the WKTU New York radio. Warner Bros. Records enlisted the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)'s Anti-Piracy Unit to delete the Internet downloads of the song. Erik Bradley, musical director of Chicago B96, classified [...] "Frozen" [...] as a [...] "the mark of a smash. Clearly, American pop radio needs Madonna", after he played the track on his station. According to Jon Uren, marketing director of Warner Music Europe, the song also had [...] "fantastic" [...] early support across Europe. Shortly after the song leaked, a remix version of [...] "Frozen" [...] was broadcast by the BBC website, and also was previewed on the soundtrack at the 1998 Versace fashion spring parade. The single was released commercially on February 23, 1998 in the United States.|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} covered by {{artists such as}} Groove Holmes, the Troggs, Charlie McCoy, and Psychic TV. John Bush commented: [...] "'Good Vibrations' was rarely reprised by other acts, even during the cover-happy '60s. Its {{fragmented}} style made it essentially cover-proof." [...] In 1976, a nearly identical cover version was released as a single by Todd Rundgren for his album Faithful. When asked for his opinion, Brian said: [...] "Oh, he did a marvelous job, {{he did a great}} job. I was very proud of his version." [...] Rundgren's single peaked at number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100. Rundgren explained: [...] "I used to like the sound of the Beach Boys, but it wasn't until they began to compete with the Beatles that I felt that what they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> really interesting—like around Pet Sounds and 'Good Vibrations' ... when they started to shed that whole surf music kind of burden and start to branch out into something that was a little more universal. ... I tried to do [...] as literally as I could because in the intervening 10 years, radio had changed so much. Radio had become so formatted and so structured that that whole experience was already gone." ...|$|E

500|$|Russo was not {{involved}} in the selection of the sourced songs used throughout the show, with Hawley already knowing the songs he wanted to use and working with music supervisor Maggie Phillips to get the license for them. With the influence of Pink Floyd's music on both Hawley and Russo, Hawley wanted to use their music in the season's finale, as Phillips noted it [...] "never quite fit in the other episodes". He chose the songs [...] "Breathe" [...] and [...] "On the Run", as [...] "they flow into each other on the record. There’s no pause in between those songs. So {{there was no way to}} go with just one song." [...] This posed an issue with the series' budget that became the hardest licensing struggle for the series. Phillips described [...] "an extremely difficult negotiation process, but we were working with some great people that recognized what we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> interesting. We ended up getting a price that we were able to persuade FX was worth it. But, it took months." [...] The songs were confirmed on the day of the final sound mix for the show. In case the songs could not have been secured, Hawley asked Phillips to choose an alternative from the works of The Flaming Lips. Phillips said she was [...] "not a huge fan of Flaming Lips, but I listened to every single song they’ve ever done". They ultimately decided that none of the songs would work for the sequence, so Russo composed original music to replace the Pink Floyd songs if necessary.|$|E

2500|$|Buckley was {{particularly}} concerned about the view that what the CIA and the KGB <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> morally equivalent.

2500|$|Despite its effectiveness, Whittlesey {{says the}} Outreach Group {{was shut down}} in 1985 when Donald Regan took over as Chief of Staff and the White House [...] "started the brown bag {{operation}} with Ollie North.

According to Whittlesey, [...] "the Washington establishment, especially Democratic but also most of the Republican, was opposed to, wanted to downplay, or gave the silent treatment to Reagan's Central American anti-communist policies." ...|$|E
2500|$|... ith hindsight, I {{can see how}} if {{somebody}} got Led Zeppelin III, which was so different from what we'd done before, and they only had a short time to review it on the record player in the office, then they missed the content. They were in a rush and {{they were looking for}} the new [...] "Whole Lotta Love" [...] and not actually listening to what was there. It was too fresh for them and they didn't get the plot. So, in retrospect, it doesn't surprise me that the diversity and breadth of what we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> overlooked or under-appreciated at the time.|$|E
2500|$|About that time, William Gibson's novel Neuromancer was published, {{delivering}} the {{glimpse of a}} future encompassed by what became an archetype of Cyberpunk [...] "virtual reality", with the human mind being fed light-based worldscapes through a computer interface. Some, perhaps ironically including Bethke himself, argued {{at the time that}} the writers whose style Gibson's books epitomized should be called [...] "Neuromantics", a pun on the name of the novel plus [...] "New Romantics", a term used for a New Wave pop music movement that had just occurred in Britain, but this term did not catch on. Bethke later paraphrased Michael Swanwick's argument for the term: [...] "the movement writers should properly be termed neuromantics, since so much of what they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> clearly Imitation Neuromancer".|$|E

2500|$|The band {{subsequently}} reissued {{its debut}} studio album, Queens of the Stone Age (1998), in 2011, and embarked upon an extensive tour playing the album in full each night. Homme stated, [...] "Doing the rehearsals {{for the first}} record is really defining the new one. It's been turning the new record into something else. What we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> kind of bluesy, and now it's turned into this trancey, broken thing. The robots are back!" [...] However, in 2013, Homme noted, [...] "I was hoping that playing the first record would really inspire me and make me {{fall in love with}} music again.
