5000|$|Gordon's {{books and}} teachings {{emphasize}} {{the idea of}} [...] "self-care as the true primary-care," [...] and that patients should be provided with information and techniques to keep themselves healthy. He also takes issue with what he considers the [...] "disease model" [...] of healthcare. In an interview with Daniel Redwood D.C., regarding his position as Chair of the White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy, Gordon is quoted saying:"I believe <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> our fundamental orientation from a too narrow focus on end stage disease management to keeping people healthy, whole and well. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the distribution of resources from overwhelming emphasis on acute care {{at the end of}} the line to teaching people how to stay well.

5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it felt like <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I wanted it to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|R

Owen said of the album, [...] "It was quite downbeat, and <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> it <b>to</b> bring more energy to it. Then around May {{the three of us}} locked ourselves down for two or three weeks and started to play with sounds and for me that’s when we started for real. The energy was more positive.

40|$|Three years ago, the {{legislature}} and the governor agreed that a fundamental review of California government was imperative. The result {{was the creation of}} the 23 -member California Constitution Revision Commission. The Commission, consisting of gubernatorial and legislative appointments and selected state officers, {{met for the first time}} in May 1994. The governor and legislative leaders addressed the Commission and urged it to be bold and creative and to consider all relevant issues-however controversial. The Commission 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations reflect those admonitions. Thirty public meetings were held including four formal public hearings, plus five workshops and, along with the League of Women Voters, 39 community forums and video conferences.
