25|$|We risk {{erosion of}} First Amendment liberties unless <b>we</b> <b>train</b> our {{vigilance}} upon the methods whereby obscenity is condemned {{no less than}} upon the standards whereby it is judged. Questions of procedural safeguards loom large {{in the wake of}} an order such as the one before us. Among them are: (a) whether Congress can close the mails to obscenity by any means other than prosecution of its sender; (b) whether Congress, if it can authorize exclusion of mail, can provide that obscenity be determined in the first instance in any forum except a court, and (c) whether, even if Congress could so authorize administrative censorship, it has in fact conferred upon postal authorities any power to exclude matter from the mails upon their determination of its obscene character.|$|E

60|$|They were boy {{and girl}} together, and {{afterwards}} they met again as fellow students {{in a world of}} comfortable discretions. He seems to have taken the decorums of life with a confiding good faith, to have been shy and innocent in a suppressed sort of way, and of a mental type not made for worldly successes; but he must have dreamt about her and loved her well enough. How she felt for him I could never gather; it seemed to be all of that fleshless friendliness into which <b>we</b> <b>train</b> our girls. Then abruptly happened stresses. The man who became her husband appeared, with a very evident passion. He was a year or so older than either of them, and he had the habit and quality of achieving his ends; he was already successful, and with the promise of wealth, and I, at least, perceived, from my botanist's phrasing, that his desire was for her beauty.|$|E
6000|$|It {{does not}} follow that we shall be driven catastrophically from India. That was my earlier mistake. We are not proud enough in our bones to be ruined by India as Spain was by her empire. We {{may be able to}} abandon India with an air of still {{remaining}} there. It is our new method. <b>We</b> <b>train</b> our future rulers in the public schools to have a very wholesome respect for strength, and as soon as a power arises in India in spite of us, be it a man or a culture, or a native state, we shall be willing to deal with it. We {{may or may not have}} a war, but our governing class will be quick to learn when we are beaten. Then they will repeat our South African diplomacy, and arrange for some settlement that will abandon the reality, such as it is, and preserve the semblance of power. The conqueror DE FACTO will become the new [...] "loyal Briton," [...] and the democracy at home will be invited to celebrate our recession--triumphantly. I am no believer in the imminent dissolution of our Empire; I am less and less inclined to see in either India or Germany the probability of an abrupt truncation of those slow intellectual and moral constructions which are the essentials of statecraft.|$|E

6000|$|To the Captain I {{addressed}} myself {{after my}} friends had gone. They {{told me that}} a good many American officers dressed by the French army. The Captain certainly might have been mistaken for a French officer of light cavalry, and he had more than the courtesy of a Frenchman. Yes, he had read {{a good deal about}} our Indian border warfare, and had been much struck with the likeness it bore to Red Indian warfare. I had better, when I reached the next cavalry post, scattered between two big geyser basins, introduce myself to a Captain and Lieutenant. They could show me things. He himself was devoting all his time to conserving the terraces, and surreptitiously running hot water into dried-up basins that fresh pools might form. [...] "I get very interested in that sort of thing. It's not duty, but it's what I'm put here for." [...] And then he began to talk of his troop as I have heard his brethren in India talk. Such a troop! Built up carefully, and watched lovingly; [...] "not a man that I'd wish to exchange, and, what's more, I believe not a man that would wish to leave on his own account. We're different, I believe, from the English. Your officers value the horses; we set store on the men. <b>We</b> <b>train</b> them more than we do the horses." ...|$|E
60|$|Now I {{want to get}} {{first at}} some, I do not say approximate, but at all events some suggestive, {{estimate}} of the quantity of real distress and misguided life in this country. Then next, I want some fairly representative estimate of our private expenditure in luxuries. We won't spend more, publicly, it appears, than eight hundred thousand a year, on educating men gratis. I want to know, as nearly as possible, what we spend privately a year, in educating horses gratis. Let us, at least, quit ourselves in this from the taunt of Rabshakeh, and see that for every horse <b>we</b> <b>train</b> also a horseman; and that the rider {{be at least as}} high-bred as the horse, not jockey, but chevalier. Again, we spend eight hundred thousand, which is certainly a great deal of money, in making rough minds bright. I want to know how much we spend annually in making rough stones bright; that is to say, what may be the united annual sum, or near it, of our jewellers' bills. So much we pay for educating children gratis;--how much for educating diamonds gratis? and which pays best for brightening, the spirit or the charcoal? Let us get those two items set down with some sincerity, and a few more of the same kind. Publicly set down. We must not be ashamed of the way we spend our money. If our right hand is not to know what our left does, it must not be because it would be ashamed if it did.|$|E
60|$|The East Side of New York. A {{whirlwind}} of noise and smell and hovering shadows. The jargon of Jewish matrons in brown shawls and orthodox wigs, chaffering for cabbages and black cotton stockings and gray woolen undershirts with excitable push-cart proprietors who had beards so prophetic {{that it was}} startling to see a frivolous cigarette amid the reverend mane. The scent of fried fish and decaying bits of kosher meat, and hallways as damnably rotten of floor as they were profitable to New York's nicest circles. The tall gloom of six-story tenements that made a prison wall of dulled yellow, bristling with bedding-piled fire-escapes and the curious heads of frowzy women. A potpourri of Russian signs, Yiddish newspapers, synagogues with six-pointed gilt stars, bakeries with piles of rye bread crawling with caraway-seeds, shops for renting wedding finery {{that looked as if}} it could never fit any one, second-hand furniture-shops with folding iron beds, a filthy baby holding a baby slightly younger and filthier, mangy cats slinking from pile to pile of rubbish, and a withered geranium in a tin can whose label was hanging loose and showed rust-stains amid the dry paste on its back. Everywhere crowds of voluble Jews in dark clothes, and noisily playing children that catapulted into your legs. The lunger-blocks in which <b>we</b> <b>train</b> the victims of Russian tyranny to appreciate our freedom. A {{whirlwind of}} alien ugliness and foul smells and incessant roar and the deathless ambition of young Jews to know Ibsen and syndicalism. It swamped the courage of hungry Carl as he roamed through Rivington Street and Essex and Hester, vainly seeking jobs from shopkeepers too poor to be able to bathe.|$|E

30|$|In this case, <b>we</b> <b>trained</b> a 2 -layer RNN with 1024 hidden {{units in}} a LSTM cell as MSTT model, in a {{traditional}} way. In this approach, <b>we</b> <b>trained</b> an end-to-end speech recognition setup that consisted of one network performing conversion from the acoustic domain to the textual one. Because we {{decided to use the}} end-to-end model, we used a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function. This loss function does not require a frame-level alignment (matching each input frame to the output token). Therefore, it allows the use of the labeled speech datasets, without the need to align the text with the soundwave frames [25 – 31].|$|R
40|$|Our {{approach}} to the ImageCLEF 2010 tasks is based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients descriptors (HOG) and Okapi BM 25 based text retrieval.

To represent each image with only one vector we computed a Bag-of-Words (BOW) model from GMM probabilities of HOG descriptors. <b>We</b> <b>trained</b> linear regression classificators for the Photo Annotation task.
