5|$|Jill Abbott is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. The longest-running (and only remaining original) character, Jill was created and introduced by William J. Bell. Originally portrayed by Brenda Dickson, when Dickson departed in 1980, the role was first recast with Deborah Adair. Dickson returned in 1983, {{and although she}} stated that she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> the role again, she was replaced by Jess Walton in 1987, who continues in the role to present time.|$|E
5|$|Liliʻuokalani helped {{preserve}} {{key elements}} of Hawaii's traditional poetics while mixing in Western harmonies brought by the missionaries. A compilation of her works, titled The Queen's Songbook, was published in 1999 by the Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust. Liliʻuokalani used her musical compositions {{as a way to}} express her feelings for her people, her country, and {{what was happening in the}} political realm in Hawaii. One example of the way her music reflected her political views is her translation of the Kumulipo, the Hawaiian creation chant. While under house arrest, Liliʻuokalani feared she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> the palace alive, so she translated the Kumulipo in hopes that the history and culture of her people would never be lost. The ancient chants record her family's genealogy back to the origin story of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|After the {{partition}} Rejtan withdrew from political life. He never married. He {{spent the rest}} of his days in a small estate at Hruszówka, where he died on August 8, 1780. His mental health had deteriorated; according to some due to distress with the loss of a part of his homeland, but rumours about his erratic behavior date to soon after the Partition Sejm begun in 1773, before its final motions were passed in 1776. He {{is said to have been}} escorted by his brothers from Warsaw on 19 March 1775 after he had a fit, and was locked in a small family's mansion which he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> up till his death. Eventually he committed suicide, cutting himself with glass (most detailed accounts say he swallowed it, to prevent being taken by pursuing Russian soldiers). His exact place of burial is unknown, and exhumation in Hruszówka in 1930 failed to conclusively find his grave.|$|E

60|$|The quarrel ended, as usual, by Mary's {{bursting}} into {{a fit of}} tears, and by my aunt's repeating the assertion {{that it was not}} too late, she trusted; and from that day forth she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> me.|$|R

5|$|As {{she grew}} older Betsy {{suffered}} from numerous illnesses, the exact natures {{of which are}} not recorded but which {{are known to have}} caused William great concern. William began to become paranoid that Betsy would marry and leave his service, in 1835 going as far as to have her sign an affidavit that she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> him. In 1843 his older brother Charles, a successful planter in Java, returned to England after over 30 years abroad. William became deeply suspicious that Betsy was becoming too close to Charles, a suspicion intensified when Charles took her on a visit to Holland and the Rhine; Charles returned to Java in 1845. In around 1844 Betsy struck up a close relationship with the pen manufacturer and art collector Joseph Gillott, one of William's regular customers who owned some of his pictures. Gillott was married with children, and the closeness of their relationship caused William concern. In 1848, William retired to York leaving Betsy alone in his London apartment; although aware that Betsy was considering marriage he was confident that he could persuade her to come to York and live with him in his retirement. Betsy did eventually join him in York, and was present at his death.|$|E

25|$|While {{working at}} Harvard, Georgescu was {{approached}} by Vanderbilt University, who offered him a permanent academic chair as economics professor. Georgescu accepted the offer and moved to Vanderbilt in Nashville, Tennessee in 1949. It {{has been argued that}} Georgescu's decision to move from Harvard to the permanence and stability of the less prestigious Vanderbilt was motivated by his precarious wartime experiences and his feeling of insecurity as a political refugee in his new country. It has also been argued that Joseph Schumpeter had at this point lost most of his former influence that could have secured his once mentee Georgescu a permanent position at Harvard (Schumpeter died in 1950). Georgescu remained at Vanderbilt until his retirement in 1976 at age 70. Except for short trips, he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> Nashville again.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Guatemala President Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes {{ordered his}} P-51 Mustangs to attack five Mexican fishing vessels in contested waters. Soon after that incident, Roberto Fierro and Luis Farell were {{appointed}} Chief and Sub-Chief of the Mexican Air Force, respectively. At this time, Mexico had no natural enemies and {{was dedicated to}} industrial growth, not to a military buildup. The conflict was resolved with diplomacy. Farell and Fierro concluded that the Mexican Air Force could not confront the powerful P-51 Mustang aircraft if required again, so they purchased a fleet of Vampire MK-3 jets made available by Canada, and Lockheed T-33 jets from the USA. Farell applied himself at establishing a system that <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> Mexico in such vulnerable position again — a difficult task given the limited budget available.|$|E
25|$|In Poland, the Kielce Pogrom (July 1946) {{led to a}} wave of Holocaust {{survivors}} fleeing Europe for Palestine. Between 1945 and 1948, 100,000–120,000 Jews left Poland. Their departure {{was largely}} organized by Zionist activists in Poland {{under the umbrella of}} the semi-clandestine organization Berihah ("Flight"). Berihah was also responsible for the organized emigration of Jews from Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, totaling 250,000 (including Poland) Holocaust survivors. The British imprisoned the Jews trying to enter Palestine in the Atlit detainee camp and Cyprus internment camps. Those held were mainly Holocaust survivors, including large numbers of children and orphans. In response to Cypriot fears that the Jews <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> (since they lacked a state or documentation) and because the 75,000 quota established by the 1939 White Paper had never been filled, the British allowed the refugees to enter Palestine at a rate of 750 per month.|$|E

60|$|On {{the steps}} of the eating house they found a thin and glowering boy of ten smoking a cigarette. The dining-room had been left in chaos by the peripatetic appetites. A youngish woman reclined, exhausted, in a chair. Her face wore sharp lines of worry. She had once possessed a certain style of beauty that <b>would</b> <b>never</b> wholly <b>leave</b> her and <b>would</b> <b>never</b> wholly return. Trinidad set forth his mission.|$|R
25|$|In late May 1842, she {{sailed to}} New Orleans for much-needed repairs with only nine sailors. After {{receiving}} a complete overhaul and recruiting a new crew at New Orleans, the Wharton and Moore's flagship, the Austin {{set out on}} April 19, 1843 again for a cruise off the Yucatan coast. They sailed to Campeche and there engaged the Mexican steam frigate Moctezuma on April 30 in the first Naval Battle of Campeche. Although the Austin and the Wharton succeeded in temporarily driving the Mexican fleet from Yucatan waters, the Wharton {{was struck by a}} sixty-eight-pound shot; two men were killed and four were wounded when one of her own guns exploded during the two days of fighting. A decisive second engagement with the Mexican fleet on May 16, 1843, resulted in a clear Texan victory. The Austin and the Wharton left Mexican waters on June 25 and arrived at Galveston on July 14, 1843, effectively bringing to an end the active service of the Texas navy, as the ships <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> port again.|$|E
25|$|While {{she was in}} Qazvin, her uncle, Mulla Muhammad Taqi Baraghani, was murdered, and {{the blame}} for this placed on her by her husband, even though she denied any involvement. Baraghani had been an inveterate enemy of Shaykh Ahmad. During Táhirih's stay in Qazvin, Baraghani had {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} sermons in which he attacked the Báb and his followers. There is no hard evidence as to the identity of the murderer, nor any proof as to Táhirih's involvement or lack of it. With her arrest Táhirih’s powerful father convinced the authorities that rather than kill Táhirih, she would be imprisoned in her home. Táhirih’s father kept her under house-arrest in his cellar, appointing her maids to act as spies. Though interpreted as a cruel act in Root’s interviews with family members of Táhirih one claimed this was done out of genuine fear for her safety. Her father was convinced of his daughters’ innocence, but her husband was violently against her. He argued that Táhirih be put on trial for the murder of her uncle. Her father positively refused citing Táhirih <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> her home. Nevertheless, authorities forcefully arrested Táhirih and one of her maids in the hope that she would testify against her.|$|E

500|$|Olmstead {{split the}} 1950–51 season between four teams, playing {{for all but}} one of them. He began the season playing for the Black Hawks franchise, playing 15games in the NHL and 12 in the USHL, for the Milwaukee Sea Gulls. On December 2, 1950, Olmstead, with Vic Stasiuk, was traded to the Detroit Red Wings, in {{exchange}} for Lee Fogolin and Steve Black. [...] On December 19, 1950, 17days after the trade to Detroit, he was traded again, without ever suiting up for the Red Wings, to Montreal, for Leo Gravelle. Olmstead <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> the NHL until his retirement in 1962, playing 39games that season on a line with Maurice Richard and Elmer Lach, scoring 38 points. Olmstead also appeared in 11playoff games, collecting six points, as the Canadiens lost the best-of-seven Stanley Cup finals to the Toronto Maple Leafs in five games.|$|E

[...] The Quakers lasted only one season before suspending operations in 1931, along with the Ottawa Senators. [...] The Quakers never returned, but Ottawa resumed operations in 1932–33. [...] The Senators continued to struggle, and despite a promise by Calder in 1934 that the Senators <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> [...] "hockey's birthplace of Canada", the team was nonetheless transferred south to become the St. Louis Eagles. The Eagles played only one year in St. Louis before asking for permission to suspend operations. [...] The league refused, and instead bought and dissolved the team. The Eagles' players were dispersed amongst the remaining teams. It was announced that the NHL would be an eight-team league in 1935–36.|$|E
500|$|The elderly Ian Smith {{lived in}} an unassuming house in Harare where, {{according}} to David Blair, [...] "the front gate always stood open and virtually anyone who walked up the drive would be invited in for tea". He still owned Gwenoro, but employed a manager to run it after Janet's death in 1994. He insisted that he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>leave</b> Zimbabwe. [...] "Don't get fazed by the riots, hold your head high, do not be afraid," [...] a friend reported him saying. [...] "Show you are not budging and the government will leave you alone." [...] He dedicated much of his 1997 autobiography, The Great Betrayal, to criticising the Mugabe administration and a long succession of British figures he considered to have let him and Rhodesia down; he also defended and attempted to justify his actions as Prime Minister, and praised Nelson Mandela, calling him Africa's [...] "first black statesman". Smith's enduring popularity among white Zimbabweans was evidenced by the long queues they formed to have him sign copies of the book on its release in Harare in December 1997. [...] "They were captured, hiding their faces and turning to the wall, as television cameras recorded their 'betrayal' for the evening news," [...] Josephine Fisher records. Not all of the country's whites admired Smith, however; some felt that his obstinate refusal to acknowledge {{what they saw as}} past errors caused the whole white community to be resented and viewed with suspicion.|$|E

A Rolling Stones critic commented Beyoncé was looking {{stunning}} in a bridal suite, {{adding that the}} most disarming thing about the clip is that she sings directly to the camera. The review concludes that, [...] "the video hits all of its marks perfectly, conveying all of the nuances in the lyrics while providing a lovely, memorable visual." [...] The Washington Posts Sarah Anne Hughes wrote Beyoncé is [...] "extravagantly dressed" [...] in the video adding that the only downside {{is that there is}} no dance in the tradition of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] (2008). Kara Warner of MTV News called [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] and [...] "Best Thing I Never Had", [...] "as different as night and day" [...] adding that the same thing happened with their music videos. Werner further praised Beyoncé [...] "gorgeous" [...] dress and added that it [...] "will likely land on a few style blogs soon, given its embroidered and jeweled details, not to mention the silk bows and ruching on the sides". A writer of The Huffington Post described the video as a transition to the one for [...] "Run the World". Cristina Everett of Daily News noted that the look of satisfaction and hapinness on her face make the video the best revenge for her ex-lover. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan noted that Beyoncé was looking [...] "makeup-commercial-flawless".
