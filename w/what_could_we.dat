The screams pierced the heart of the heavens. We didn't know what to doâ€¦. They were going from door to door, slaughtering everyone who was inside. The screams and the moans were terrible. People were crying Help! Help! But <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> do?" ...|$|E
60|$|DEARTH. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> do for {{our friend}} who passed just now? I can't {{get her out}} of my head.|$|E
60|$|But <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> {{do about}} the tent? It would be {{impossible}} to go away and leave that, with its contents, for a whole day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Three hundred pounds! Oh, Dick, {{just think}} <b>what</b> fun <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have, and <b>what</b> good <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do with it! Do {{let him have}} them." ...|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS. Of course. What are {{the police}} for? <b>What</b> else <b>could</b> <b>we</b> do? [He {{sits in the}} Elizabethan chair].|$|R

6000|$|... "My dear!" [...] remonstrated the major. [...] "We knew {{nobody else}} in the neighborhood, and, as Mr. Armadale kindly {{suggested}} our bringing our friends, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am unhappy, Ben," [...] she said. [...] "But <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> expect? It {{might be}} worse. For instance, {{you might have}} been killed. I've much to be thankful for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I settled Johnny Gibson {{should keep}} them. He {{is going to}} bring his dog, you know; besides, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> do with them? We can't cook them, can we?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is on John's head," [...] she {{answered}} sadly, [...] "not on Hugh's hand. I warned him, and Hugh spared him once. <b>What</b> more <b>could</b> <b>we</b> do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We quarrelled like brutes, and who wonders? [...] <b>What</b> self-respect <b>could</b> <b>we</b> keep, Worse housed {{than your}} hacks and your pointers, [...] Worse fed than your hogs and your sheep? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely! And he is right. I am less {{critical}} of him to-day than I was last night. He gave his psychic over into our hands. <b>What</b> more <b>could</b> <b>we</b> ask?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It ain't likely. You see, it snows up hyar. Mebbe we'll be snowed in fer a spell. An' thet {{valley is}} open down thar. In deep snow <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> find? We'll wait an' see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now I {{think of}} it,' said Anne, 'it {{was the most}} ridiculous part of the affair, {{considering}} the blunder that Lizzie told me Mrs. Turner made about St. Augustine. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> have been dreaming of?' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{confess that}} I, too, felt compunction at abandoning them thus, but <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> do? I only trust that no harm came to them, {{but of course}} we never heard {{anything}} as to their fate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ha! I thought so!" [...] exclaimed Krake in contempt. [...] "It's {{bad taste}} ye {{have to want}} a song from him after hearing me! But <b>what</b> else <b>could</b> <b>we</b> expect from ye?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Irina Slutsky {{was born}} in Kazakhstan, which was, at the time, part of the Soviet Union. Speaking of her {{childhood}} in 2007, Slutsky said [...] "When I lived in the Soviet Union... we were told <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> read, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> write, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> couldn't read, what we couldn't watch.... Needless to say, the Soviet Union isn't around any more; that stuff doesn't work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stuff! I'm in a corner. What else {{is there}} to do? <b>What</b> less <b>could</b> <b>we</b> do? <b>What's</b> the money for, if it isn't to--" [...] Hilary choked with the emotion that filled him {{at the sight of}} his son's face.|$|R
6000|$|Then Nora spoke. [...] "But <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> do, Mr. Stanbury? It {{seemed so}} natural {{that he should}} call {{when he was in}} the neighbourhood. We have known him so long; and how could we refuse to see him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> lads {{do other}} than obey, when his {{commands}} were laid upon us, even though our hearts were so sore that {{it seemed as if}} it would no longer be possible to live when he had departed? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you foolish old Uncle! Come in at once. The Major {{has been}} terribly excited over you, and swore {{you should not}} be allowed to wander through the streets without someone to look after you. But <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> do?" ...|$|E
60|$|The fatal hour drew on. My boy Harry was born, and {{his mother}} lived to kiss and bless him. Then she sank. <b>We</b> did <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>could,</b> but <b>we</b> had little skill, and might not hold her back from death. All through one weary night I watched her with a {{breaking}} heart.|$|R
60|$|He passed on. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> it mean? <b>We</b> hearkened {{after his}} tread. Before it died away, I sprang and caught Flora by the hand.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Alas! <b>what</b> hope <b>could</b> <b>we</b> {{have but}} in praying?' said Elisabeth, {{with tears in}} her eyes. 'Little one, we will be joined at least in our prayers and intercessions: thou wilt not forget in thine one who yet lives, unhappier than all!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Capital?' cried my aunt. 'But you {{are doing}} us a great service--have done us a great service, I may say, for surely much {{will come out of}} the fire--and <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> do for you, that would be half so good as to find the capital?' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> do? We wished her at--Bath: {{certainly}} not in London. But there was no help for it; and we were obliged to bring her: for, as my mother said, if we offended her, her fortune would go out of our family; and were we two young people not likely to want it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear child, Lord Brackenshaw is in Scotland, {{and knows}} nothing about us. Neither your uncle nor I would choose to apply to him. Besides, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> do in this house without servants, and without money to warm it? The sooner we are out the better. We have nothing to carry but our clothes, you know?" ...|$|E

6000|$|On {{the fourth}} day comes the astrologer from his {{crumbling}} old tower up the valley, where {{he had heard the}} news, I reckon. He had a private talk with us, and we told him <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>could,</b> for <b>we</b> were mightily in dread of him. He sat there studying and studying awhile to himself; then he asked: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was not voluntary,' said Louis. 'When the {{carriage}} was confiscated {{for the service}} of the nation, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> do?--I can tell you, Jem,' he added, fervently, 'what a gallant being she is!

6000|$|Up rose the laird to red the cumber,[150] [...] Which {{would not}} be for all his boast;-- [...] <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> doe with sic a number?

6000|$|Being dead, however, these {{arguments}} {{did not apply}} to eating him, as we were sure he would himself acknowledge. So we cut off little bits of his flesh and, rolling them in snow till they looked as though they were nicely floured, hunger compelling us, swallowed them at a gulp. It was a disgusting meal and we felt like cannibals: but <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>we</b> do? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on, dear. The {{dead are}} always with us, and <b>what</b> better company <b>could</b> <b>we</b> have than {{the dust of}} our sainted predecessor." ...|$|R
