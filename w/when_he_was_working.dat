5|$|Shinkai {{said the}} OVA was {{inspired}} by Dracula and Laputa. He stated that production took seven months to complete. He said another inspiration was his frequent sending of text messaging to his wife <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>working.</b> Shinkai cited the availability of digital hardware and software tools for image production at his workplace, Falcom, and friends' view that individual film production could occur because of the introduction of PlayStation 2 and DVDs.|$|E
5|$|Though Scott drew heavily {{upon his}} wife's intense {{personality}} in his writings, {{much of the}} conflict between them stemmed from the boredom and isolation Zelda experienced when Scott was writing. She would often interrupt him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>working,</b> and the two grew increasingly miserable throughout the 1920s. Scott had become severely alcoholic, Zelda's behavior became increasingly erratic, and neither made any progress on their creative endeavors.|$|E
5|$|Spotnitz {{found that}} the main problem with {{developing}} the episode was segueing from a movie that some—but not necessarily all—viewers had seen. The writers sought to bring back characters like Gibson Praise, Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender who {{were not in the}} movie. In addition, the writers also wanted to bring back elements that were also seen in the movie, like the alien. Carter claims to have been thinking about what the episode would entail almost two years prior, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> on developing The X-Files movie. The character Sandy, who is killed in the teaser sequence, was played by the show's casting director Rick Millikan on the request of Carter. Millikan later joked that he spent most of the shoot on his cell phone casting other individuals for other X-Files episodes. One of the nuclear power plant workers is named Homer, a reference to Homer Simpson, one of the main characters from the animated Fox television series The Simpsons.|$|E

Nemes started working on the screenplay with Royer in 2010 and completed the first draft in 2011. The writers spent several years on research, while historians such as Gideon Greif, Philippe Mesnard and Zoltán Vági provided support for the film. Prof. Gideon Greif's book We Wept without Tears inspired director László Nemes to create a film dedicated to the Sonderkommando, the most delicate, complicated and sensitive topic within the Holocaust.|$|E

500|$|While MalcolmX and {{scholars}} contemporary to the book's publication regarded Haley as the book's ghostwriter, modern scholars tend to regard {{him as an}} essential collaborator.

For example, MalcolmX left the Nation of Islam during the period <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>working</b> on the book with Haley. Rather than rewriting earlier chapters as a polemic against the Nation which Malcolm X had rejected, Haley persuaded him to favor a style of [...] "suspense and drama".

The plot of the film follows many personal experiences that Saria himself went through, growing up in the Indian hill town of Darjeeling, and later at the Ithaca Arts College, New York.|$|E
