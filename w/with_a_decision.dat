5|$|Critics {{and analysts}} deemed Windows RT to be commercially unsuccessful, citing these limitations, its unclear, uncompetitive {{position}} of sitting as an underpowered system between Windows Phone and Windows 8, {{and the introduction}} of Windows 8 devices with battery life and functionality that met or exceeded that of Windows RT devices. Improvements to Intel's mobile processors, along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> by Microsoft to remove OEM license fees for Windows on devices with screens smaller than 9 inches, spurred a market for low-end Wintel tablets running the full Windows 8 platform. These devices largely cannibalized Windows RT; vendors began phasing out their Windows RT devices due to poor sales, and {{less than a year after}} its release, Microsoft suffered a US$900 million loss that was largely blamed on poor sales of the ARM-based Surface tablet and unsold stock.|$|E
5|$|On April 10, 1826, Rowan {{sponsored}} {{an amendment}} to legislation to reorganize the federal judiciary that would have required seven justices to concur <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> in order to strike down a law as unconstitutional.

Rowan offered another amendment providing that ministers of the federal courts would be subject to state laws when carrying out the decisions of the federal courts. After a month of debate, the entire bill was tabled.|$|E

5|$|Support for the Provisional Government {{began to}} be tested when the issue of land reform and corvées was again brought to the forefront. Aside from the {{important}} conservative forces, opponents of the measure were to be found inside the leadership body itself, and included the moderates Heliade Rădulescu and Ioan Odobescu. Revolutionaries who favored passing land into the property of peasants were divided over the amount {{that was to be}} ceded, as well as over the issue of compensation to be paid to boyars. A compromise was reached through postponing, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> taken to submit all proposals to the vote of the Assembly, which was yet to be convened, instead of drafting a decree. Nevertheless, a Proclamation to estate-holders was issued (June 28, 1848), indicating that the reform was to be eventually enforced in exchange for unspecified sums, and calling on peasants to fulfill their corvées until autumn of the same year.|$|E
