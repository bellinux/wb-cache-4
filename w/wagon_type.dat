5|$|The {{accident}} {{was followed by}} a national day of mourning in Canada, and a ban on all E350 Ford Club <b>Wagon</b> <b>type</b> vehicles being used for student transport in New Brunswick. Two investigations, one by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the other by Transport Canada, found that the cause of the disaster was a combination of poor road conditions, lack of proper snow tires, and possible driver error. Pressure from the public and victims' families prompted the chief coroner of the province to launch an inquiry, which produced recommendations to improve student transport safety in New Brunswick. The provincial government agreed with the majority of the suggestions and has since enacted many of them.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{proposals}} were to modify AMC's captive import by extending the Metropolitan with a station <b>wagon</b> <b>type</b> roof design {{to make room}} for four passengers. However the [...] wheelbase of the Metropolitan severely limited the necessary interior room, and costs of the overseas built model were harder to control. On the other hand, the company had retained the tooling from its 1955 model Rambler. The old model's [...] wheelbase fit between its bigger family-sized [...] wheelbase Ramblers and the small import. The old design could be slightly modified and then used for the basis of the [...] "new" [...] American.|$|E

50|$|The German State Railway Wagon Association (Deutscher Staatsbahnwagenverband) or DWV was an {{association}} of the German state railways Länderbahnen founded in 1909. The purpose of the association was to guarantee the unrestricted exchange of goods wagons between the member railway administrations. The German State Railway Wagon Association could, unlike the Prussian State Railway Wagon Association, stipulate standard wagon designs {{for the whole of}} Germany. It developed a total of eleven different <b>wagon</b> <b>types,</b> the Verbandsbauart (literally: association <b>type)</b> or DWV <b>wagons.</b> In addition to entire goods <b>wagons,</b> <b>types</b> of bogie were also specified.|$|R

50|$|Goods wagons or {{freight wagons}} (North America: goods cars or freight cars) are {{unpowered}} railway vehicles {{that are used}} for the transportation of cargo. A variety of <b>wagon</b> <b>types</b> are in use to handle different types of goods, but all goods wagons in a regional network typically have standardized couplers and other fittings, such as hoses for air brakes, allowing different <b>wagon</b> <b>types</b> to be assembled into trains. For tracking and identification purposes, goods wagons are generally assigned a unique identifier, typically a UIC wagon number, or in North America, a company reporting mark plus a company specific serial number.|$|R

50|$|The Fiat Tipo (sedan Type 356, {{hatchback}} Type 357, station <b>wagon</b> <b>Type</b> 358), {{also known}} as the Fiat Egea in Turkey, is a sedan compact car.

50|$|After the Deutsche Reichsbahn {{had been}} founded in 1920, in 1921 all goods <b>wagons</b> <b>types</b> {{with the same}} or similar roles were grouped into {{so-called}} class districts. These were named after cities that were the headquarters of a Reichsbahn division or, later, other cities too. Work on re-lettering and renaming the wagons began in 1922 and was largely completed by 1924.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the coming}} of {{privatisation}} to Britain's railways, new <b>wagon</b> <b>types</b> have been introduced by EWS (HTA), GB Railfreight (HYA), Freightliner Heavy Haul (HHA and HXA) and Jarvis Fastline (IIA). These new wagons have increased tonnage and air-operated doors that {{do away with the}} need for the [...] "Dalek" [...] release mechanism at the power station end of the trip.|$|R
50|$|It was a tank <b>wagon</b> <b>type</b> tender, {{similar in}} {{appearance}} to the North American Vanderbilt type tender, with a cylindrical water tank which had an inside diameter of 6 ft. The tender {{was similar to}} the Type MX tender, but its wheelbase was 10 ft shorter. Like the Type MX tender, it rode on three-axle Buckeye bogies, supplied by General Steel Castings of Eddystone, Pennsylvania, and became commonly known as a Torpedo tender. Like its engine, the tender was equipped with vacuum brakes.|$|E
50|$|This {{code was}} {{discovered}} by Peter J Vincent during research in 1992. It appears that during the 1930s conversion project from screw couplers to automatic couplers resulted in a short-term lack of louvre and box vans; to fill the gap, fifty M cattle wagons were converted from 1932 during their own conversion to autocouplers, with wooden planks and louvres used to cover the gaps over the normal cattle wagon design. The wagons were restored to their M <b>wagon</b> <b>type</b> and identity by 1934.|$|E
50|$|A Travelall name badge {{was mounted}} on the front cowl {{directly}} below the International name badge. A few L-Series trucks were also produced with windows and seats in 1952, but whether the Travelall name was used that year is unknown. Prior to 1952, International station <b>wagon</b> <b>type</b> vehicles were mainly woodies, having wooden bodies produced by outside companies. A few K-Series panels in the latter 1940s were built with windows and seats and used by airlines to move people at airports. The Travelall name continued {{to be used for}} station wagon versions of the succeeding S-line, A-line, and B-line pickup trucks.|$|E

50|$|Like the Class 24 and {{the last}} batch of the Class 19D, the Class S2 had a tank <b>wagon</b> <b>type</b> tender, similar in {{appearance}} to the American Vanderbilt type tender, with cylindrical water tanks and commonly known as a Torpedo tender. Its Type MY1 tender also rode on three-axle Buckeye bogies to reduce the axle load, but was much shorter than the Type MX tender of the Class 19D and with a different coal bunker top design {{than that of the}} Type MY tender of the Class 24. As was done with the tenders of the Classes S and S1, the top sides of the coal bunker were scalloped out to improve the crew's rearward field of vision.|$|E

5000|$|The medieval {{carriage}} {{was typically}} a four-wheeled <b>wagon</b> <b>type,</b> with a rounded top ('tilt') similar in appearance to the Conestoga Wagon familiar from the USA. Sharing the traditional form of wheels and undercarriage known since the Bronze Age, it very likely also employed the pivoting fore-axle in continuity {{from the ancient}} world. Suspension (on chains) is recorded in visual images and written accounts from the 14th century ('chars branlant' or rocking carriages), and was in widespread use by the 15th century. [...] Carriages were largely used by royalty, aristocrats (and especially by women), and could be elaborately decorated and gilded. These carriages were on four wheels often and were pulled by two to four horses depending on how they were decorated (elaborate decoration with gold lining made the carriage heavier). Wood and iron were the primary requirements needed to build a carriage and carriages that were used by non-royalty were covered by plain leather.|$|E
