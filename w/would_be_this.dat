25|$|The p-value was {{introduced}} by Karl Pearson in the Pearson's chi-squared test, where he defined P (original notation) as {{the probability that the}} statistic would be at or above a given level. This is a one-tailed definition, and the chi-squared distribution is asymmetric, only assuming positive or zero values, and has only one tail, the upper one. It measures goodness of fit of data with a theoretical distribution, with zero corresponding to exact agreement with the theoretical distribution; the p-value thus measures how likely the fit <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> bad or worse.|$|E
25|$|Little {{investment}} in private homes or businesses {{took place in}} the neighborhood between 1911 and the 1990s. However, the unwillingness of landlords elsewhere in the city to rent to black tenants, together with {{a significant increase in the}} black population of New York, meant that rents in Harlem were for many years higher than rents elsewhere in the city, even as the housing stock decayed. In 1920, one-room apartments in central Harlem rented for $40 to whites or $100–$125 to blacks. In the late 1920s, a typical white working-class family in New York paid $6.67 per month per room, while blacks in Harlem paid $9.50 for the same space. The worse the accommodations and more desperate the renter, the higher the rents <b>would</b> <b>be.</b> <b>This</b> pattern persisted through the 1960s; in 1965, CERGE reported that a one-room apartment in Harlem rented for $50–$74, while comparable apartments rented for $30–$49 in white slums. The high rents encouraged some property speculators to engage in block busting, a practice whereby they would acquire a single property on a block and sell or rent it to blacks with great publicity. Other landowners would panic, and the speculators would then buy additional houses relatively cheaply. These houses could then be rented profitably to blacks.|$|E
25|$|Philosophers, {{like all}} {{men at the}} time had to make ways of {{bringing}} food to the table. The most common occupation in the Byzantine Empire would have either been agriculturally based or earlier on in the Empire, trade based so this came about naturally through their own work. However Philosophers needed Patronage in order to live. The most important came from the Imperial court, especially before the destructive civil wars that were characterized by Andronikos III and his son John V. Other sources were from minor courts, from the rich and from the Church, if not from individual Church clergy. Of course, only Bishops had such resources. As the Empire descended into chaos, it could not spare any finances {{in its efforts to}} defend her borders and so the need to study in the fields of science and mathematics would have naturally disappeared from the minds of those whose lands were raided and seized. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>this</b> lack of Patronage that led to many of these scholars fleeing to the West. Remarkable travels were recorded by John Argyropoulos, Constance, Manuel Chrysoloras who between them all had travelled to Florence, Pavia, Rome, Padua and Milan. It could be said {{that the end of the}} Byzantine Empire coincided with the beginning of the Renaissance — what little influence the Byzantine Church had over Rome was more than made up for by their philological preaching and mass conversion to humanism.|$|E

500|$|Endite-exite {{hypothesis}}: The hypothesis {{with perhaps}} the strongest evidence {{is that which}} stems from the adaptation of endites and exites, appendages on the respective inner and outer aspects of the primitive arthropod limb. This was advanced by Trueman based on a study by Goldschmidt in 1945 on Drosophila melanogaster, in which a pod variation displayed a mutation transforming normal wings to what was interpreted as a triple-jointed leg arrangement with some additional appendages but lacking the tarsus, where the wing's costal surface normally <b>would</b> <b>be.</b> <b>This</b> mutation was reinterpreted as strong evidence for a dorsal exite and endite fusion, rather than a leg, with the appendages fitting in much better with this hypothesis.

500|$|The idea of {{insanity}} in English law dates from 1324, when the Statute de Praerogativa Regis allowed the King {{to take the}} lands of idiots and lunatics. The early law used various words, including [...] "idiot", [...] "fool" [...] and [...] "sot" [...] to refer {{to those who had}} been insane since birth, and [...] "lunatic" [...] for those who had later become insane, or were insane with some lucid intervals. In the criminal law, insanity was used as a defence in a roughly identical way from this point until the late 16th century; if an insane person commits a crime, he was not punished {{in the same way that}} a sane felon who committed the same crime <b>would</b> <b>be.</b> <b>This</b> was for several reasons; firstly, the cruel punishment usually meted out to felons to set an example would not have the same effect on the insane. Secondly, as felonies required a mens rea, an insane person could not be guilty because they did not have the capacity to hold a mens rea. Thirdly, the phrase furiosus solo fitrere punitur was used; [...] "a lunatic was punished by his madness alone".|$|E
