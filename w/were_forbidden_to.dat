5|$|According to biographer Vijay Singh, it was {{unheard of}} for Cariappa {{to use his}} power and status for {{personal}} purposes.

5|$|Afghanistan did {{not send}} any {{delegation}} to the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand, due to economic difficulties. Laws implemented by the Taliban government also {{made it impossible for}} Afghan athletes to compete. For example, the International Boxing Association (AIBA) does not allow players to have beards and mustaches, but Afghan males <b>were</b> <b>forbidden</b> <b>to</b> cut their facial hair. Afghanistan returned to the Asian Games {{after the fall of the}} Taliban government in the midst of ongoing war.

5|$|Before World War II, Poland's Jewish {{community}} had numbered between 3,300,000 and 3,500,000 persons– about 10 {{percent of the}} country's total population. During World War II, Germany's Nazi regime sent millions of deportees from every European country to the concentration camps it {{set up in the}} General Government in occupied Poland. Soon after war had broken out, the Germans began their extermination of Polish Jews, ethnic Polish, Romani, Russians, Czech, and others minorities of Poland. Most were quickly rounded up and imprisoned in ghettos, which they <b>were</b> <b>forbidden</b> <b>to</b> leave.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{made some}} new laws {{regarding}} the Jews, but {{while some of}} his edicts were unfavorable towards Jews, they were not harsher than those of his predecessors. It was made illegal for Jews to seek converts or to attack other Jews who had converted to Christianity. They <b>were</b> <b>forbidden</b> <b>to</b> own Christian slaves or to circumcise their slaves. On the other hand, Jewish clergy were given the same exemptions as Christian clergy.|$|E

5|$|During the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), {{emperors}} chose their consorts {{primarily from}} one of the eight Banner families, administrative divisions that divide all native Manchu families. To maintain the ethnic purity of the ruling dynasty, after the Kangxi Period (1662–1722), emperors and princes <b>were</b> <b>forbidden</b> <b>to</b> marry non-Manchu wives. Imperial daughters however were not covered by this ban, and as with their preceding dynasties, were often married to Mongol princes to gain political or military support, especially {{in the early years of}} the Qing dynasty; three of the nine daughters of Emperor Nurhaci and twelve of Emperor Hongtaiji's daughters were married to Mongol Princes.|$|E

During a period of food shortages on the island, a relief vessel arrived on a Saturday, but the minister said that the islanders had {{to spend the day}} preparing for church on the Sabbath, and it was Monday before supplies were landed. Children <b>were</b> <b>forbidden</b> <b>to</b> play games and required to carry a Bible wherever they went. Mackay remained minister on St Kilda for 24 years.|$|E

In the development of the narrative, the intended marriage was shown to be part of God's plan to strike at the Philistines.|$|E

5|$|Arab and Islamic {{influences}} strongly mark Antemoro culture. Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing {{included a}} turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes {{similar to those}} worn in {{many other parts of}} the Muslim world. Harefo reeds were woven to form mats (tafitsihy) that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of fanto (beaten barkcloth) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn over one shoulder. Adolescent and adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats, as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with whom they <b>were</b> <b>forbidden</b> <b>to</b> marry.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to their disqualification, former presidents Hubert Maga and Sourou-Migan Apithy staged protests while Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, another ex-president, supported an obscure candidate named Basile Adjou Moumouni. The election was held on May 15, and was Dahomey's first since 1964. Moumouni won the election with 80 percent of the vote, but Alley declared the result void because the protest prevented nearly three-quarters of the electorate from voting. This result sparked further demonstrations, and Maga, Apithy, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, and former president Christophe Soglo <b>were</b> <b>forbidden</b> <b>to</b> enter the country, {{in an attempt to}} crack down on dissent. Alley felt he had made a mistake in disqualifying Maga, Apithy, and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, as he believed that only they could bring unity to Dahomey.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Aboriginal peoples {{used the}} {{materials}} at hand {{to make their}} instruments for centuries before Europeans immigrated to Canada. First Nations people made gourds and animal horns into rattles, which were elaborately carved and brightly painted. In woodland areas, they made horns of birch bark and drumsticks of carved antlers and wood. Traditional percussion instruments such as drums were generally made of carved wood and animal hides. These musical instruments provide the background for songs, and songs the background for dances. Traditional First Nations people consider song and dance to be sacred. For years after Europeans came to Canada, First Nations people <b>were</b> <b>forbidden</b> <b>to</b> practice their ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|When on leave, Roger often {{stayed with}} his Uncle Edward at Tichborne Park and became {{attracted}} to his cousin Katherine Doughty, four years his junior. Sir Edward and his wife, {{though they were}} fond of their nephew, did not consider marriage between first cousins desirable. At one point the young couple <b>were</b> <b>forbidden</b> <b>to</b> meet, though they continued to do so clandestinely. Feeling harassed and frustrated, Roger hoped {{to escape from the}} situation through a spell of overseas military duty; {{when it became clear that}} the regiment would remain in the British Isles, he resigned his commission. On 1 March 1853 he left for a private tour of South America on board La Pauline, bound for Valparaíso in Chile.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} call-up of reservists to man the {{garrison}} artillery, the commanding {{officers of the}} other militia units were directed to begin preparations to raise an infantry division and a light horse division for home defence tasks. By the end of August 1914 the Government had judged that a force of this size was unnecessary given that Australia was distant from the war zones. Instead, {{it was decided to}} maintain {{only a small number of}} infantry battalions and light horse regiments on active duty at any one time. By the end of 1914 the home defence force comprised 100,000 reservists, of whom 56,000 were members of the Citizen Forces and 51,000 were rifle club volunteers. Despite fears of sabotage and uprisings by German-Australians, no domestic threat eventuated. From 1915, only skeleton garrisons were maintained at coastal forts, but the personnel manning them <b>were</b> <b>forbidden</b> <b>to</b> enlist in the AIF. This ban was lifted in April 1915 but the presence of a German commerce raider in Australian waters caused a mobilisation from February to April 1916, while another occurred in April 1918 for the same reason. In June 1918, 9,215 home service troops were on active duty in Australia, alongside 2,476 regular soldiers. Up to 50,000 militiamen enlisted in the AIF during the war.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Choy and her husband, Choy Khun Heng, {{were running}} their canteen at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, {{after all the}} {{patients}} and doctors had been moved from the Miyako Hospital (former Woodbridge Hospital). She had been a school teacher at St Andrew's School before the war. The couple helped the Changi prisoners-of-war (POW) by passing on cash and parcels containing such things as fresh clothing, medicine and letters during their deliveries. An informant told the Kempeitai that the Choys were involved in smuggling money into Changi Prison, and Khun Heng was arrested. After several days, Elizabeth went to the YMCA on Stamford Road, used by the Kempeitai as their headquarters, known as the Kempeitai East District Branch, to inquire about her husband. The Japanese denied all knowledge of him, but three weeks later they lured {{her back to the}} YMCA and confined her with other Chinese and Changi prisoners. There was no sign of Khun Heng. The prisoners <b>were</b> <b>forbidden</b> <b>to</b> speak to one another, although one of the internees, John Dunlop, secretly taught them to communicate in sign language.|$|E
