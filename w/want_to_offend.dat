But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>offend</b> the Russians.|$|E
25|$|Nur ad-Din {{sought to}} make alliances with his Muslim {{neighbours}} in northern Iraq and Syria in order to strengthen the Muslim front against their crusader enemies. In 1147 he signed a bilateral treaty with Mu'in ad-Din Unur, governor of Damascus; {{as part of this}} agreement, he also married Mu'in ad-Din's daughter Ismat ad-Din Khatun. Together Mu'in ad-Din and Nur ad-Din besieged the cities of Bosra (see Battle of Bosra) and Salkhad, which had been captured by a rebellious vassal of Mu'in ad-Din named Altuntash, but Mu'in ad-Din was always suspicious of Nur ad-Din's intentions and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>offend</b> his former crusader allies in Jerusalem, who had helped defend Damascus against Zengi. To reassure Mu'in ad-Din, Nur ad-Din curtailed his stay in Damascus and turned instead towards the Principality of Antioch, where he was able to seize Artah, Kafar Latha, Basarfut, and Balat.|$|E
25|$|With {{the dream}} of {{building}} a lucrative overseas colony for Scotland, the Company of Scotland invested in the Darien scheme, an ambitious plan devised by William Paterson to establish a colony on the Isthmus of Panama {{in the hope of}} establishing trade with the Far East. The Darién scheme won widespread support in Scotland as the landed gentry and the merchant class were in agreement in seeing overseas trade and colonialism as routes to upgrade Scotland's economy. Since the capital resources of the Edinburgh merchants and landholder elite were insufficient, the company appealed to middling social ranks, who responded with patriotic fervour to the call for money; the lower classes volunteered as colonists. But the English government opposed the idea: involved in the War of the Grand Alliance from 1689 to 1697 against France, it did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>offend</b> Spain, which claimed the territory as part of New Granada. The English investors withdrew. Returning to Edinburgh, the Company raised 400,000 pounds in a few weeks. Three small fleets with a total of 3,000 men eventually set out for Panama in 1698. The exercise proved a disaster. Poorly equipped; beset by incessant rain; under attack by the Spanish from nearby Cartagena; and refused aid by the English in the West Indies, the colonists abandoned their project in 1700. Only 1,000 survived and only one ship managed to return to Scotland.|$|E

500|$|France {{intended}} to help in establishing 200 elementary schools on Albanian language, {{as part of the}} strategy of Albanian national affirmation. On the other hand, all the Greek schools were forced to close down, while the Greek element of the city was persecuted. The Albanian National Lyceum ( [...] , [...] ) high school in Korçë was established in 1917. French authorities claim that they banned opening of the high school because they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>offend</b> their Greek allies led by Eleftherios Venizelos' Movement of National Defence, who claimed rights over the area. Some sources find this claim inappropriate, considering that the French Lycée in Thessaloníki sent professor Vital Gerson to lead a small team of three Albanian professors to join a French officer, who gave some notions of French culture, on the opening ceremony of the school. The French National Lyceum was the first Albanian high school that was open to the students of all faiths.|$|E

500|$|... "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee, Ben Moody and David Hodges and {{produced}} by Dave Fortman. The Millennium Choir performed background vocals for the song. According to Lee, the song talks about celebrities who have completely false images.

2500|$|Apu first {{appeared}} in the season one episode [...] "The Telltale Head".

Azaria, however, has disputed this account, claiming instead that the writers asked him to create a stereotypical Indian accent for the character. Azaria has said that he based Apu's voice on Indian convenience store workers in Los Angeles with whom he had interacted when he first moved to the area. He also loosely based it on Peter Sellers' character Hrundi V. Bakshi from the film The Party, whom Azaria thinks has a similar personality to Apu.|$|E
