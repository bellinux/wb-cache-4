25|$|During the {{relatively}} short production {{period of the}} FTO there were original equipment catalogues {{of a host of}} options made available. Many items were cosmetic in nature, such as stickers or chromed goods, although more substantial styling pieces such as side skirts and spoilers were also available. Practical items such as a passenger air bag, installed in the dashboard above the glove box, or ski-racks were also listed. There were also special 15 and 16inch PIAA alloy <b>wheels.</b> Strut <b>braces,</b> as found standard on the GP Version R for example and machine-stamped 'RalliArt', were also available via the Mitsubishi association with the Ralliart franchise.|$|R
50|$|On {{the surface}} above the shaft stands a {{building}} {{known as the}} headframe. This contained a wheel called a gin wheel which lifted buckets of rock up to a raised platform called a <b>Brace.</b> <b>Wheeled</b> buckets then carried the rock along elevated tracks to waste dumps or processing works. The steel cable that hoisted the bucket passed over the gin wheel.|$|R
50|$|In February, 2004 the {{original}} Clod Buster and Bullhead were discontinued, but {{owing to the}} model's continued popularity, Tamiya released a new version called the Super Clod Buster. The only {{differences between the two}} are the colors of various parts which were changed from red to blue, the removal of Chevrolet badging and emblems and the addition of the chromed <b>wheels</b> and chassis <b>brace</b> that were previously available only on the Bullhead.|$|R
50|$|On 25 November 1975 when Francis Crossan, a 34-year-old Catholic civilian, was {{abducted}} by the notorious Shankill Butchers gang, themselves {{members of the}} Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), from Library Street, a side street that leads immediately off Royal Avenue at the Central Library. Crossan was heading towards Royal Avenue when he was hit {{over the head with}} a <b>wheel</b> <b>brace,</b> then dragged into a waiting black taxi where he sustained a vicious beating before being fatally stabbed. He was found, with his throat deeply slashed, in an entry near Bisley Street on the Shankill Road. Crossan became the first victim of the lethal gang, which was led by Lenny Murphy. Crossan, who lived in the Suffolk district of South-West Belfast, had been walking home after spending the evening in the Holy Cross Bowling Club in the Ardoyne area of North Belfast from where his family originated.|$|E
50|$|It is {{revealed}} through flashback that Rachel killed Brian with a lead pipe {{when he tried}} to go on the run leaving her behind, her father Liam helped her to dump the body. Unfortunately due to the gardaí having the wrong murder weapon (a <b>wheel</b> <b>brace</b> with Brian's blood and Conor's prints on it) DNA evidence points to Conor as the killer. Rachel and Liam decide to keep quiet as the evidence piles up against Conor and Angela's career and reputation gets more and more damaged as she fights to clear her son's name. While Conor is in prison awaiting his court date a fellow prisoner finds out that he is the son of a garda and stabs him. The guilt proves to be too much for Liam and he hands himself in, claiming he and he alone killed Brian. Conor is cleared of all charges and survives the stabbing. Nikki is used as a scapegoat and sent for retraining in Donegal.|$|E
5000|$|On 24-25 November 1975, Murphy {{adopted the}} method that gained the Butchers infamy far beyond Belfast. Using the city's sectarian {{geography}} to identify likely targets, Murphy roamed the areas nearest the Catholic New Lodge {{in the hope}} of finding someone likely to be Catholic to abduct. Francis Crossen (34), a Catholic man and father of two, was walking towards the city centre at approximately 12:40 when four of the Butchers, in Moore's taxi, spotted him. As the taxi pulled alongside Crossen, Murphy jumped out and hit the man with a <b>wheel</b> <b>brace</b> to disorientate him. He was dragged into the taxi by Benjamin Edwards and Archie Waller, two of Murphy's gang. As the taxi returned to the safety of the nearby Shankill area, Crossen suffered a ferocious beating. It is clear that he was subjected to a high level of violence, including a beer glass being shoved into his head. Murphy repeatedly told Crossen: [...] "I'm going to kill you, you bastard", before the taxi stopped at an entry off Wimbledon Street. Crossen was dragged into an alleyway and Murphy, brandishing a butcher's knife, cut his throat almost through to the spine. The gang dispersed. Crossen, whose body was found the next morning (Tuesday) by an elderly woman, was the first of three Catholics to be killed by Murphy in this [...] "horrific and brutal manner". [...] "Slaughter in back alley" [...] was the headline in the city's major afternoon newspaper that day. A relative of Crossen said that his family was unable to have an open coffin at his wake because the body was so badly mutilated.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{changes were}} made during 1924. [...] The Douglas engine was {{replaced}} with a 32hp (24kW) Bristol Cherub II flat twin. [...] This more powerful motor was also lighter, lacking the reduction gear of the Douglas and therefore mounted in the extreme nose with propeller and exposed cylinders at wing level. [...] At {{about the same time}} the empennage was modified with a squarer tailplane, taller, less rounded [...] fin and square tipped rudder. [...] The leaf spring undercarriage was replaced with a lighter split axle unit carrying smaller <b>wheels</b> and <b>braced</b> with conspicuous V-struts to the wing roots. There were also modifications {{to the top of the}} fuselage, including the installation of a side hinged cockpit cover with an opening just large enough to allow the pilot's head to protrude.|$|R
2500|$|Much of the {{publicity}} and funding for the Pisgah Home movement came from Yoakum's work as a faith healer and an early Pentecostal evangelist, traveling to many locations in California, the Eastern United States and Europe. [...] His work as a healer received praise in many religious publications, and a secular writer noted {{that some of the}} lame and blind who came to Pisgah Home [...] "left <b>wheel</b> chairs, crutches, <b>braces,</b> and canes to be hung in impressive testimony along the walls." ...|$|R
40|$|The "Erie" {{was built}} in 1837 and was of 497 gross tons. This drawing depicts the "Erie" which left Buffalo, New York for Chicago, Illinois on August 9, 1841 with 250 {{passengers}} and crew. The "Erie" traveled approximately 40 miles to Silver Creek, Lake Erie, when fire broke out. High winds fanned the flames. The "Dewitt Clinton" of Dunkirk, New York saw the flaming vessel and rushed to aid the passengers. The "Dewitt Clinton" rescued 27 persons, {{some of whom were}} hanging on the <b>wheel</b> and the <b>braces.</b> Others were floating on boxes and in small boats. Approximately, 150 of those lost were immigrants. It was determined that the "Erie" had been recently painted. Turpentine cans had been placed near the boilers...|$|R
5000|$|Nesbitt did {{not know}} at the time that William Moore was part of the murderous gang led by Brookmount Street {{resident}} Lenny Murphy, who commanded a UVF platoon that operated mainly from the [...] "Brown Bear" [...] pub, located on the corner of Mountjoy Street and the Shankill Road, not far from the Tennent Street station. Murphy had a pathological hatred of Catholics, and as a means of manifesting this hatred on the Catholic community at large, had formed a murder gang with like-minded friends from his [...] "Brown Bear" [...] platoon. The gang's modus operandi involved the abduction of innocent men walking home at night from areas that were overwhelmingly Catholic due to the sectarian geography of Belfast. Once the victims were hit over the head with a <b>wheel</b> <b>brace</b> and dragged into Moore's taxi, they were driven away to be subjected to a beating and torture session that ended with their being dumped, usually into a Shankill alleyway, where their throats were then sliced with butcher's knives. On the night Francis Rice was killed, Murphy had brought along two female acquaintances to observe the beating and murder. In addition to the cut-throat killings, Murphy and the Shankill Butchers also carried out sectarian shootings of random Catholics and punishment killings against their loyalist rivals, the most notable being that of Noel [...] "Nogi" [...] Shaw on 30 November 1975 as part of an internal UVF feud. Inside the [...] "Lawnbrook Social Club", in full view of his unit, Murphy savagely beat, pistol-whipped and then repeatedly shot Shaw in the head; afterwards he ordered his body to be placed in a laundry basket. Shaw {{was a part of the}} UVF [...] "Windsor Bar" [...] platoon which was commanded by Anthony [...] "Chuck" [...] Berry and its members were rivals of the [...] "Brown Bear" [...] gang controlled by Murphy. The two pubs were a quarter of a mile apart from one another. Police from Nesbitt's C Division found Shaw's body in a back street off the Shankill several hours after he'd been killed.|$|E
5000|$|José Pocino's Toucan has a pod style {{fuselage}} {{with the}} pilot enclosed {{under a single}} piece canopy that continues the fuselage profile. The pilot's seat is ahead of the wing leading edge, with the pusher engine behind it. For its first flight the Toucan was powered by a Hirth two cylinder, two stroke engine, completely enclosed within the fuselage but this was soon replaced by a [...] Rotax 503.2V engine of similar configuration, driving a three rather than two-bladed propeller. The engine change led to a slightly revised engine cowling and a decreased area of the cockpit transparency. A fixed tricycle undercarriage is mounted on the fuselage. Initially the main <b>wheel</b> legs were <b>braced</b> but have been replaced with cantilevers.|$|R
2500|$|Because of {{the high}} {{centrifugal}} forces encountered during drifting, drivers are usually retained by a racing seat and five-point harness. This allows the hands to merely turn the <b>wheel,</b> instead of <b>bracing</b> {{the body in the}} seat. The same applies for the feet, which are free to move rapidly between clutch, brake and accelerator pedals. The steering wheel is usually relatively small, dished, and perfectly round, {{so that it can be}} released and allowed to spin through the hands as the caster returns the front wheels to center. The locking knob on the hand brake is usually replaced with a spin turn knob; this stops the hand brake locking on when pulled. Nearly all drivers move the hand brake location or add an extra hydraulic hand brake actuator for greater braking force. Additional gauges used to monitor boost levels, oil pressure and temperature, intake and coolant temperatures, air-fuel ratio (also called λ, or [...] "lambda" [...] ratio), etc. Some drivers, especially in larger cars, move the seating position for a better weight distribution, such as Daigo Saito's 2014 JZX100 Mk.II Chaser.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was flat}} sided, fabric covered over ash longerons with a rounded decking, deepest at the cockpit, from tail to nose. The tail surfaces were also fabric covered wooden structures. The fin was quite small and triangular, carrying a generous, semicircular unbalanced rudder on a hinge which {{leaned forward in}} flying attitude. The rudder continued down to the fuselage bottom, so the elevators, mounted with the tailplane {{on the top of}} fthe fuselage had a cut out in which it could move. The cockpit was fully upholstered, with a large luggage space behind that could alternatively have seated a child. The AL.1 was powered by a 95 hp (71 kW) seven cylinder Salmson AC.7 radial engine, mounted without a cowling and driving a two-bladed propeller. The undercarriage was a single axle unit with the main legs attached at the front spar roots. The legs were braced, unusually, by struts from the axle to the forward fuselage just behind the engine. The undercarriage legs splayed outwards to produce a large track. The <b>wheels</b> were wire <b>braced,</b> though in some images they are covered. There was a tailskid on the rear fuselage.|$|R
