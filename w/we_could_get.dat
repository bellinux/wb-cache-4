25|$|We {{did some}} rather audacious things. We shot {{on top of}} a train in Train Town in Griffith Park without a permit, while one of us was given one of the guards money and another of us was talking to another guard, just so <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the shots finished. We knew we couldn't be there long. All we had to do was do our legerdemain for five or ten minutes and be out of there. And we {{certainly}} couldn't pay for it.|$|E
25|$|So <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> down to business. We {{divided the}} exhibitors in two, {{those who were}} headed by Signac and Luce, the other made up of artists of the new generation. On {{one side of the}} central room the rooms would be given to the older members; on the other, the young {{painters}} organised the rooms that had been given to them. For our part, we took Room 41. In the following rooms, André Lhote, Segonzac, La Fresnaye etc. would take their place. It was at this moment that we got to know each other.|$|E
25|$|We {{will never}} accept any global deal {{that does not}} limit global warming to the minimum {{unavoidable}} level, no matter what levels of compensation and assistance are promised to us… While we will reason with everyone to achieve our objective, we will not rubber stamp an agreement by {{the powers that be}} as the best <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> for the moment. We will use our numbers to delegitimize any agreement that is not consistent with our minimal position. If needs be we are prepared to walk out of any negotiations that threaten to be another rape of our continent.|$|E

500|$|Under {{the working}} title [...] "Jellybean", {{the film was}} shot over a span of six weeks in fifty-two locales {{throughout}} the city of Atlanta. Filming {{took place in the}} summer, sometimes in temperatures over a hundred degrees, challenging the cast and crew's ability to stay motivated. [...] "A lot of times we had to motivate each other to say 'listen, up your game. Go hard,'" [...] said Robinson. [...] "And sometimes we needed to step back, take a breath, so <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> through." ...|$|E
500|$|Hackett has {{considered}} the album {{to be his}} favourite Genesis record, and was happy with his extensive contributions to it. In 2017, he explained, [...] "It was an important watershed album for the band, {{and it was at}} the beginning of us struggling to find gigs in the States. If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> into a club somewhere, wherever it was, that was good news for us at that time. A young, struggling band, but with an album that was due to become a classic in time." [...] Banks and Rutherford have had mixed feelings, saying {{there are a lot of}} high points but also some lows.|$|E
500|$|In 1959, Johnson was {{suspended}} indefinitely by the Lions after {{he missed the}} team plane back to Detroit following a November 1 blowout loss to the 49ers. To that point, the Lions had a 1–5 record, and coach George Wilson used Johnson's suspension {{as an opportunity to}} scold the whole team for its lack of [...] "desire." [...] Johnson was ultimately fined $1,000. Wilson took the brunt of the blame for Detroit's struggles in 1958 and 1959, but he questioned the resolve of some of the team's higher-paid players, including Johnson. Following the season, Johnson was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers for two draft picks. [...] "That's all <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> for him," [...] explained Wilson.|$|E

500|$|According to {{a friend}} of Presley's, [...] "their adult {{friendship}} began in November 1992 in L.A." [...] They met at a private dinner held at the home of their mutual friend the artist Brett-Livingstone Strong. Knowing that Presley had been looking for help within the music industry, Strong had her play tapes for Jackson, who was impressed with Presley's voice. The pair talked {{for the remainder of the}} night, until it was time for Jackson to leave. At this point, according to Strong, the entertainer gave Presley, who was still married at the time, a penetrating look and said in a conspiratorial voice, [...] "You and me, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> into a lot of trouble. Think about that, girl." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Gethsemane" [...] created intense media {{speculation}} {{about whether or}} not Mulder was actually dead. An article in the Wall Street Journal discussed fan theories behind Mulder's madness while a cartoon ran in The New Yorker a few weeks later surrounding Mulder's [...] "death". [...] Series creator Chris Carter noted that [...] "the whole plot line of 'Gethsemane' revolved around a hoax, but there are actually huge revelations in this show. And it's an amazing thing that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> people to believe that Mulder could actually kill himself because his belief system was stolen from him". UGO Networks listed the episode at number 21 in a countdown of [...] "TV's Best Season Finales", noting that it [...] "rocked the core of the series' entire mythology".|$|E
500|$|Hackworth said [...] "it was {{neck and}} neck, but I had {{absolute}} belief {{we could do}} it". [...] Four-time Olympic gold medallist Matthew Pinsent said of the race [...] "it truly was amazing". [...] Cambridge coach Robin Williams was generous in defeat: [...] "Credit to Oxford. They did an awesome job and took their chance. It was a fantastic race", while Oxford's coach Sean Bowden said [...] "I believed that if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> through Barnes Bridge well we could still do it. [...] They were rowing so well and I knew how much they wanted it." [...] Simon Barnes of The Times noted that [...] "Cambridge reeled in an early Oxford lead and went ahead themselves ... {{that should have been}} the end of it... But this Oxford crew just kept pestering away ... and, with the finish in sight, Cambridge ... yielded." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Kirchherr and her art school friends were {{involved}} in the European existentialist movement whose followers were later nicknamed [...] "Exis" [...] by Lennon. In 1995 she told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "Our philosophy then, because we were only little kids, was wearing black clothes and going around looking moody. Of course, we hadn't a clue who Jean-Paul Sartre was. We got inspired by all the French artists and writers, because that was the closest <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get.</b> England was so far away, and America was out of the question. So France was the nearest. So we got all the information from France, and we tried to dress like the French existentialists... We wanted to be free, we wanted to be different, and tried to be cool, as we call it now." ...|$|E
500|$|Development of Perfect Dark Zero {{began on}} the Nintendo GameCube with a very small team of roughly ten people. At the time, Nintendo had a 49% stake in Rare, making the company a Nintendo second-party developer. According to lead {{designer}} Chris Tilston, [...] "It was basically prototyping, finding out where we could go and how <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> there." [...] When Rare was purchased by Microsoft in 2002, the project {{was transferred to the}} Xbox console and the game's multiplayer mode was redesigned for online play. Tilston revealed that at one point they got to 50 players online simultaneously, but the graphics [...] "just couldn't handle it." [...] Since the initial version of the game pushed the original Xbox hardware [...] "pretty hard", the project was ultimately transferred to the Xbox successor, the Xbox 360. Tilston revealed that the original Xbox version was [...] "about 12 months away" [...] from completion when the shift occurred.|$|E
500|$|Cameron sketched Jack's nude {{portrait}} of Rose for a scene which he feels has {{the backdrop of}} repression. [...] "You {{know what it means}} for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It's kind of exhilarating for that reason," [...] he said. The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. [...] "It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them," [...] Cameron stated. [...] "They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot." [...] Cameron said he and his crew [...] "were just trying to find things to shoot" [...] because the big set [...] "wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> to shoot." [...] After seeing the scene on film, Cameron felt it worked out considerably well.|$|E
6000|$|... “It beats me,” he said, {{shaking his}} head. “But I don’t {{like to give}} up, and that tomato-juice would be of service if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>get</b> at it.” ...|$|R

500|$|The {{fact that}} Conrad would guest star on Family Guy was {{originally}} announced in October 2008. Creator Seth MacFarlane told Fox News, [...] "I {{thought it would}} be funny to see if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> [...] to read very, very dense historical documents centering around the second World War, [...] Lauren did one scene where she had to read a paragraph on scientific self-analysis, which I thought was funny." [...] The staff was impressed with Conrad's performance, saying that she [...] "took it very seriously." [...] Conrad praised her time at the show, calling it [...] "amazing", and said that [...] "they destroy me in it. I'm totally making fun of myself. [...] It was funny, I had to go over historical facts and like, biology and weird formulas I had no idea about." [...] Conrad explained that she is playing a character on The Hills, [...] "because America likes dumb people", and that [...] "The idea in the episode is that they make fun of me for being dumb, and then discover that I'm actually a genius, [...] It's a more exaggerated version of who I am, but fun to play." ...|$|E
500|$|The Crusaders' {{winning run}} {{finally came to}} an end when they were beaten 39–5 by the Blues in the third round of the 2003 Super 12 season. Although their 15-match unbeaten streak had ended, Richie McCaw said of the loss, [...] "...in some ways it was almost a relief. We'd finally been beaten, the run was over, so people could stop talking about it and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> on with playing it week by week." [...] The Crusaders {{recovered}} to finish second on the table with eight wins. They hosted a semi-final against the Hurricanes, who were coached by Colin Cooper, a former assistant coach for the Crusaders. Despite this inside knowledge of the team by the Wellington coach, the Crusaders won the match 39–16. In the final, the Crusaders met the Blues, another team coached by a former Crusaders assistant coach, Peter Sloane. Hooker Mark Hammett scored two tries to give the Crusaders a 10–6 lead at half-time. The Blues hit back to lead 21–10 with ten minutes to go. The Crusaders managed another converted try, but it was not enough, and the Blues won 21–17.|$|E

UGO Networks listed the episode at number 21 in a countdown of [...] "TV's Best Season Finales", noting that it [...] "rocked the core of the series' entire mythology". Den of Geek's John Moore felt that the episode was [...] "one of the finest season-enders" [...] of the series, noting that it [...] "ended by completely pulling the carpet out from under the fans". Moore listed the character of Michael Kritschgau as the seventh-best villain of the series, adding that he shook [...] "what we knew about the show to its core" [...] by [...] "provid nourishment to a seed of doubt that had been playing on Mulder's mind for the entire season".|$|E

500|$|... "The Climb" [...] {{has been}} covered by several amateurs and {{established}} acts. Mirror Image Records' indie rock group HelenaMaria covered {{the song and}} released it as a digital single in March 2009. At auditions for the ninth season of the television singing competition American Idol, [...] "The Climb" [...] {{was the most popular}} choice of song amongst contestants. Mandi Bierly, writing for Entertainment Weekly, commented, [...] "it sounds like <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> an Idol whose voice actually suits the inspirational tune that he or she will be forced to record as a first single. (Though the odds of that song being anywhere as good as 'The Climb'...)". While informing Cyrus of its popularity on American Idol, the series' host Ryan Seacrest commented that the contestants [...] "believe [...] a song that will make an impression and [...] will get them into that next level". Cyrus said she was pleased because the song was about [...] "following your dreams and not giving up". Alan Cumming covered the song in his cabaret tour and included it on the audio CD Alan Cumming Sings Sappy Songs: Live at the Cafe Carlyle. Australian Judah Kelly covered the song on his debut album, Count On Me (2017).|$|E
500|$|Curtis chose Notting Hill as {{he lived}} there {{and knew the}} area, saying [...] "Notting Hill is a melting pot and {{the perfect place to}} set a film". This left the {{producers}} to film in a heavily populated area. Kenworthy noted [...] "Early on, we {{toyed with the idea of}} building a huge exterior set. That way we would have more control, because we were worried about having Roberts and Grant on public streets where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> thousands of onlookers." [...] In the end they decided to film in the streets. Michell was worried [...] "that Hugh and Julia were going to turn up on the first day of shooting on Portobello Road, and there would be gridlock and we would be surrounded by thousands of people and paparazzi photographers who would prevent us from shooting". The location team, and security personnel prevented this, as well as preventing problems the presence of a film crew may have caused the residents of Notting Hill, who Michell believes were [...] "genuinely excited" [...] about the film. The location manager Sue Quinn, described finding locations and getting permission to film as [...] "a mammoth task". Quinn and the rest of her team had to write to thousands of people in the area, promising to donate to each person's favourite charity, resulting in 200 charities receiving money.|$|E
500|$|According to Baley, on July 29 Savedra {{informed}} the Rose–Baley Party, now camped near Leroux Springs, {{that the next}} reliable drinking water was seventy or [...] away, and {{there would not be}} a closer source until the coming rainy season. This distance exceeded what most animals could travel without water, and several members of the party were opposed to proceeding any further west until another source had been found. Udell disagreed, [...] "I contended that we had better travel on, for, with careful and proper treatment, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the stock through to water, and if we remain here until the rainy season, in all human probability our provisions would be exhausted, and we should parish with starvation." [...] Despite his pleas, nobody wanted to go on until they had located potable water, so six men agreed to undertake a search in hopes that Savedra had overlooked a closer source. Two days later, a man returned to camp and reported that a spring had been found [...] west, but its supply was so sparse that it could not {{meet the needs of the}} entire wagon train at once. After a thorough debate it was decided that, despite stern warnings from Army officers in Albuquerque against splitting into smaller groups, the best course of action was to divide the train in two and water their stock separately.|$|E
6000|$|... "We might {{cut through}} it, master," [...] Meinik said. [...] "With a sharp saw <b>we</b> <b>could</b> cut a hole big enough, in an hour, to carry his litter out. The only thing is, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>get</b> his bed through that window." ...|$|R
