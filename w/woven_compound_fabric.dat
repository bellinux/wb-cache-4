40|$|Recreating of Ancient Fabrics The {{technique}} {{of how the}} Warp-faced <b>compound</b> <b>weave</b> was once woven {{has been the focus}} of study for many specialists in Japan. It was around 1921 that Heizo Tatsumura began to recreate ancient textiles from the 7 th and 8 th centuries, found in the Shosoin Repository and the Horyuji Temple. He used the new Jacquard mechanism, which had been imported from France in 1873 with great dexterity. With this mechanism, along with his gifted creativity and inventiveness Tatsumura produced new techniques for the purpose of recreation. The very modem Tatsumura chose the Jacquard mechanism as his tool but at the same time he believed in the importance of always going back to original ancient textiles and to thoroughly research them. His strong conviction to learn from the past became especially important in order to understand and recreate the weaving techniques of the highly intricate warp-faced <b>compound</b> <b>weave</b> which was born in ancient China and lost around the Tang Period (A. D. 618 - 906). Tatsumura discovered valuable information through his persistence in investigation and his ability to reconstruct the work on the modem Jacquard mechanism shed light on techniques that had been lost. His thinking process and his deep knowledge of ancient methodology gives us insights into how an ancient weaver might have set up and operated his loom. This paper presents speculations on how the warp-faced <b>compound</b> <b>weave</b> was woven in China earlier than the Han and into the Tang periods by gaining inspirations from the methods invented and recreated by Tatsumura on his Jacquard mechanism to reconstruct the complex weave...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{examination}} of weft-faced <b>compound</b> non-silk <b>fabrics</b> found in Egypt (ca. 3 rd - 7 th century A. D.), in the Royal Ontario Museum collections, revealed many structural differences and similarities. Single, double and ply yarns with apparent variation {{in size and}} set density were observed. Some have their twist in 2 ̆ 2 S 2 ̆ 2 direction, others in 2 ̆ 2 Z 2 ̆ 2 direction, with diverse amount of twist. Wool yarns make {{up the majority of}} the constructions, but in many cases wool yarns alternate with cotton and sometimes linen yarns. Tabby and 1 / 2 twill weaves are employed as binding <b>weaves,</b> while the <b>compound</b> <b>weave</b> structures comprise 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 ratios of inner-warp to binding-warp ends. These variations provide a very interesting spectrum of textures executed in varying degrees of design complexity. The existence of many variables creates a necessity to seek: a quantitative and systematic methodology, through which identification, classification and interpretation of technical data would be possible. Reconstruction of weaving technologies has been selected as the principal criterion for the research. It requires analysis which must be detailed enough to determine the technological range of variations, and to indicate how and why weavers of different groups of civilization manipulated their weaving techniques. This paper mainly discusses the aspects considered in developing a protocol which records and confirms objectively the structural and technical parameters of the textiles under study. 1. 0. 0. The Objective: Concept and Rational A protocol for reconstructing early weaving technologies should consist of indispensable attributes to impart an integral system, thus elucidating the weaving details and mode of fabrication. It should not be devised for the mere gathering of technical data, but it should enclose a system organizing and employing these data to deal with basic and imperative questions. The data would provide information on what types of material were used; indicate how these materials were assembled in a textile form; and be utilized to explain why materials and processes changed at certain times of history in a certain way, in addition to what can be learned from textiles as to the resources, skills and knowledge of those who made it. Thus, further distinctions of early textiles can be drawn, not only on the basis of elements related to their outer appearance, but also by the indispensable attributes of their inner structures...|$|R

40|$|Consistent {{with the}} theme of this conference, my work {{involves}} a new direction in the study of weft-faced <b>compound</b> <b>weave</b> figured silks attributed to the Mediterranean region c. AD 600 - 1300. Known as samite and taqueté according to the binding structure, woven figured silks represent a highly recognizable, but poorly understood body of material. Figured silks are often described in terms of their association with the Byzantine Empire, based on representational and textual evidence. 1 The implement necessary to weave sophisticated repeating patterns was the drawloom. 2 These devices were equipped with a figure harness for repetitive production of woven patterns. Although the origin and development of these looms is obscure, they were important labor-saving devices. Patterns tied-up in a figure harness provided a means of recording and storing work for later mechanical reproduction. Without a means to replicate memorized patterns, weaving designs in silk was slow and tedious. From a modern point of view, the capability to store sequences of mechanically recorded work steps means that pattern tie-ups were, in effect, an early form of software (Fig. 1) ...|$|R

I also work this way because I love the process itself I have tailored my ideas, and risked hobbling them, in order to continue to indulge in a way of working that suits me eminently. I weave objects which I call tapestries, although technically they are <b>compound</b> twill <b>fabrics</b> with images composed of discontinuous inlaid wefts. The structure is a threeharness twill; the ground is warp-faced and the inlaid areas are weft-faced. I selected the structure after studying the three-harness twill tapestry ofKashmiri shawls. The structure confers the ability to express acutely refined detail while yielding the drape necessary for a shawl 2 ̆ 7 s function. I adapted the weave to an inlay structure in order to economize on the time spent in weaving. In fact, I weave quite rapidly as a result, often more than 122 ̆ 2 a day. I am also able to exploit both warp and weft as design elements. The sett of my warp is relatively fine, 30 epi, which gives the work good detail and yet is a large enough scale to be able to see easily the interaction of colors between individual threads...|$|R

Lignin, though not wholly unavailable, is utilized far less readily than the other cell-wall constituents, even under the most favorable circumstances.

In general, however, above a certain point, the extent to which plant materials decompose decreases as the lignin content increases. Such a material as coir fiber, with a lignin content of over 35 per cent, is quite resistant even though the major constituent is cellulose.

Starting in 1965, my first attempts in the art of magic woodcarving produced traditional pieces like chains and balls in cages, but I soon became interested in developing more sophisticated models. Among my first successes were some constellations of regular polygons woven together in symmetric patterns.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of my PhD research which applies computer-based imaging technologies to examine historic silk production evidence more intensively than was formerly possible. My program combines high-resolution images with a computer vision software application to measure identifiable quality and workshop characteristics for weft-faced <b>compound</b> <b>weave</b> figured silks attributed to Mediterranean workshops between ca. AD 600 - 1200. For a variety of reasons, research progress for this category of textiles has slowed in recent years. While essential to protect fragile textiles from damage, the consequence of conservation standards has been reduced collections access. Resource constraints and changes in museum practices mean that many institutions now focus on exhibitions rather than research. At some institutions, large textile collections built up {{on the heels of the}} antiquarian era now languish. Even at well-resourced institutions, there is little opportunity for research. Dramatic advances in digital imaging provide opportunities for the development of new methods for investigation and documentation. My research protocol combines a research grade digital microscope with a custom-built stand to perform precise digital ‘sampling’ for measurement of textile attributes including yarn characteristics, textile structure, density and pattern unit features. The computer vision application aids in error detection, providing a form of ‘industrial inspection’ for ancient textiles. The outcome is a set of objective and reproducible measurements enabling specific comparison of attributes across different collections. By using my portable equipment setup, I was able to record 127 silk fragments in ten different collections in North America and Europe. Analysis demonstrates patterns of work practices and imitative pattern reproduction among workshops. Results also help to re-unify textiles divided in antiquity or after excavation. In the future, this methodology could provide the basis for a shared database of images available to a broader community of researchers as well as supporting the work of conservators...|$|R

This nanoscale size generally confers larger surface areas to nanoparticles (NPs) compared with macro-sized particles [4]. NPs are known as controlled or manipulated particles at the atomic level (1 – 100  nm). They show size-related properties significantly different from bulk materials [5]. Given their small size, NPs have larger structures in comparison with their counterparts. This distinct property allows their possible applications in many fields such as biosensors, nanomedicine, and bionanotechnology [4]. The intrinsic properties of metal NPs such as zinc oxide (ZnO), TiO 2, and silver are mostly characterized by their size, composition, crystallinity, and morphology. Reducing the size to nanoscale can modify their chemical, mechanical, electrical, structural, morphological, and optical properties. These modified features allow the NPs to interact in a unique manner with cell biomolecules and thus facilitate the physical transfer of NPs into the inner cellular structures [6]. Nanostructured materials have a larger percentage of atoms at their surface which lead to high surface reactivity. Thus, nanomaterials have witnessed recently significant importance in the basic and applied sciences as well as in bionanotechnology.|$|R

H 577 P ITC 2015 So 181 pages :color illustrationsBio-inspired by the {{remarkable}} adhesion of marine mussels' adhesive proteins (MAPs) {{to almost any}} surface in a tidal environment, a novel bio-adhesive based method was developed for colouration of various textile materials. The colouration of various materials was easily achieved at room temperature through a simple dip-coating procedure. This method showed the characteristics of substrate-independence and room temperature colouration. Compared to the traditional colouration, it has the advantages of easy to application and low energy consumption. 3, 4 -dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (DOPA), {{was found to be}} one of the amino acid responsible for the adhesion of the marine mussels. Due to the structural similarity to DOPA, dopamine was chosen as a biomimetic precursor for the adhesive colouration. On the one hand, dopamine-induced colouration was successfully developed through its in situ polymerization for various textile materials, organic and inorganic materials,and even materials resistant to colouration. The colour appearance of the dyed materials could be tuned in a controllable way through the incorporation of different nucleophilic species such as amino acid,aromatic and heterocyclic components. The properties of the dyed materials including colours, fastness, surface morphology, composition and wettability were studied using colorimetric analysis, fastness evaluation, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and water contact angle measurement, respectively. The results indicated that the various textile materials were successfully coloured. In order to achieve a wider range of colour on textiles materials, commercially available dyes, being natural or synthetic, were also incorporated in the colouration process, in addition to the above-mentioned nucleophilic <b>compounds.</b> The dyed <b>fabrics</b> were evaluated by colorimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy optical microscopic analysis and colour fastness tests. The obtained results showed that the fabrics were also successfully dyed with good colouration property. Furthermore, a novel kind of cateholamine dye was designed and synthesized for textile material colouration as an approach to enhance the versatility of the dyes and further enrich the colour gamut produced on textiles. In this approach, a commercially available dye of Acid Yellow 11 was exampled as a model of chromophore, and dopamine was introduced as an adhesive antenna to enhance the dye fixation on textile materials. The chemical structure of the synthesized dye was confirmed from the analyses of high resolution mass spectrometry, proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the absorption spectra was tested by UV-visible spectroscopy. The UV-visible results showed that the introduction of the catechol group did not significantly change the absorption of the parent chromophore. The colouration results revealed that at room temperature the synthesized catechol dye had good colour yield on various textile fabrics, and the dyed fabrics had good fastness properties. This developed method showed the substrate-independence to some extent and was especially suitable for those textile materials difficult to be dyed with traditional method, such as polylactic acid and polypropylene. In addition,less energy consumption and colouration auxiliaries were needed by this colouration method. The biomimetic concept and its successful application represent a new step forward in textile material colouration and it is a promising alterative to the traditional process, which is substrate-dependent and high energy consumption.
