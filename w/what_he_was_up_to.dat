25|$|Tobares left Puerto Vallarta at 3 a.m., and at 8 a.m. {{he met a}} {{man named}} Rogelio ("Rocky"), an Argentine, in Guadalajara. After that he met with a Colombian {{national}} at a tobacco shop. Tobares was there until 12 p.m. and was seen exiting the store through the security cameras. He then phone called Verónica to explain <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> before disappearing. The family thinks that Gerardo set a trap for him. On June 10, a co-worker and friend of Tobares went to the Mexican police to report his disappearance. The report was made in both Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta. Tobares became the first Argentine to disappear in Mexico.|$|E
500|$|Critic Bill Wyman {{acknowledges}} that Lydon's [...] "fierce intelligence and astonishing onstage charisma" [...] were important catalysts, but ultimately finds the band's real meaning lies in McLaren's provocative media manipulations. While {{some of the}} Sex Pistols' public affronts were plotted by McLaren, Westwood, and company, others were evidently not—including what McLaren himself cites as the [...] "pivotal moment that changed everything", the clash on the Bill Grundy Today show. [...] "Malcolm milked situations", says Cook, [...] "he didn't instigate them; that was always our own doing." [...] It is also hard to ascribe {{the effect of the}} Sex Pistols' early Manchester shows on that city's nascent punk scene to anyone other than the musicians themselves. Matlock later wrote that at the point when he left the band, it was beginning to occur to him that McLaren [...] "was in fact quite deliberately perpetrating that idea of us as his puppets.... However, on the other hand, I've since found out that even Malcolm wasn't as aware of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> as he has since made out." [...] By his absence, Matlock demonstrated how crucial he was to the band's creativity: in the eleven months between his departure and the Pistols' demise, they composed only two songs.|$|E
2500|$|Reznor {{collaborated with}} Ross to compose the score for David Fincher's The Social Network, a 2010 drama {{film about the}} {{founding}} of Facebook. Says Reznor, [...] "When I actually read the script and realized <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to,</b> I said goodbye to that free time I had planned." [...] The score was noted for portraying [...] "Mark Zuckerberg the genius, developing a brilliant idea over ominous undertones," [...] and received nearly unanimous praise. The film's score was released in October 2010 in multiple formats, including digital download, compact disc, 5.1 surround on Blu-ray disc, and vinyl record. A 5-song sampler EP was released for free via digital download.|$|E
6000|$|Deering nodded. [...] "Stannard {{sent them}} back and pushed ahead with Gillane {{to look for a}} line down the other side. When we get across we'll see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> against." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{lowered the}} glass and looked at her. [...] "Waving his hands about almost as if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> praying. I wonder <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to. Worshipping the sun? There weren't Parses {{in this country in}} his time, were there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No wonder Shadow feels sleepy, if {{he spends}} his nights on the river," [...] said Phil. [...] "But I can't make out <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to, I must confess. If it <b>was</b> some fun, <b>he</b> would surely take {{somebody}} with him." ...|$|R
2500|$|Layne {{had read}} of similar {{hypnotic}} cures by the Marquis de Puységur, {{a follower of}} Franz Mesmer, and was keen to explore {{the limits of the}} healing knowledge involved with the trance voice. He asked Cayce to describe Layne's own ailments and suggest cures, and reportedly found the results both accurate and effective. Layne regarded the ability as clairvoyance. Layne suggested that Cayce offer his trance healing to the public. Cayce was reluctant as {{he had no idea what}} he was prescribing while asleep, and whether the remedies were safe. He also told Layne he himself did not want to know anything about the patient as it was not relevant. He finally agreed, on the condition that readings would be free. He began, with Layne's help, to offer free treatments to the townspeople. Layne described Cayce's method as, [...] "...a self-imposed hypnotic trance which induces clairvoyance." [...] Reports of Cayce's work appeared in the newspapers, which inspired many postal inquiries. Cayce stated he could work just as effectively using a letter from the individual as with the person being present in the room. Given only the person's name and [...] location, Cayce said he could diagnose the physical and mental conditions of what he termed [...] "the entity," [...] and then provide a remedy. Cayce was still reticent and worried, as [...] "one dead patient was all he needed to become a murderer". His fiancée, Gertrude Evans, agreed with him. [...] Few people knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to.</b> [...] There was a common belief at the time that subjects of hypnosis eventually went insane, or at least that their health suffered. Cayce soon became famous, and people from around the world sought his advice through correspondence.|$|E
60|$|I note {{without comment}} that it didn't even {{occur to me}} then to wake him up and ask him <b>what</b> <b>HE</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> with mankind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither do I, an' that's {{just why}} we're {{bound to be}} pretty careful. You see, if we could know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to,</b> it would be different." ...|$|E
50|$|As the Bennet ladies {{return to}} Longbourn, their {{carriage}} breaks down, but an army officer, Wickham, plays gallant rescuer.

3000|$|I {{choose the}} {{one guy who}} {{returned}} $ 0.00 to me every single time.

60|$|Suddenly {{he stepped}} to the windows and pulled down the shades. Then {{he took out his}} watch and looked at the time. I {{wondered}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> now. I was not long in finding out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind now," [...] cried Sammy, {{his voice}} rising above the confusion. [...] "I will {{tell you all about}} it. I see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to.</b> He wanted to take {{possession}} of the pole in his own beastly name, most likely." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few seconds}} {{brought me to}} Sergeant Drooce's hut. He was fast asleep, and being a heavy sleeper, I had to lay my hand upon him to rouse him. The instant I touched him he came rolling out of his hammock, and upon me like a tiger. And a tiger he was, except that he knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to,</b> in his utmost heat, {{as well as any}} man.|$|E
5000|$|PopMatters {{wrote that}} [...] "The album sounds great, and Mraz knows <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to. Less clear, I think, {{is whether the}} razzle-dazzle wordsmith who loves his Eminem records is ready to truly enter the {{marketplace}} as a serious vocalist and a sober songwriter", giving the album a positive rating of seven out of ten overall.|$|R
5000|$|... "Basically, {{an honest}} man who just didn't realize the immensity of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> against. In a way, I'm {{sympathetic}} to him despite his mistakes because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> so easily caricatured, and I've seen myself caricatured. And if I were a more important figure, I'd be caricatured in history books, too." [...] - on his hero, Senator Joseph McCarthy.|$|R

6000|$|... "I was hopping along mighty fast when whom should I {{see just}} ahead of me on the path but Mr. Fox, {{standing}} with his head cocked over on one side as he always holds it when he's up to some mischief.

6000|$|He {{turned to}} Amanda. [...] "Get {{back into the}} thing," [...] he said. [...] "We won't have these stinking beasts think we are afraid of the job. I've just made sure he won't have a profit by it if we smash up. That's all. I might have known <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> when he wanted the money beforehand." [...] He came to the doorway and with a {{magnificent}} gesture commanded the perplexed driver to turn the carriage.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I beg {{to observe}} that you are mistaken. Old Moss is as cunning a fox as ever lived; but I saw his game, and without my own good-will he might have whistled for me.

50|$|In {{a reality}} where Xavier acquires the Crimson Gem rather than Cain, Cain joins forces with Magneto and Xavier's disillusioned students, the X-Men. Believing that Xavier's more {{ruthless}} methods contradict his alleged dream of peaceful co-existence {{and using a}} telepathy-blocking headband to prevent Xavier from realizing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to, they expel the Juggernaut into space.

60|$|The Never bird saw at once <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to,</b> {{and screamed}} her admiration of him; and, alas, Peter crowed his {{agreement}} with her. Then {{he got into}} the nest, reared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his shirt for a sail. At the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the hat and once more sat snugly on her eggs. She drifted in one direction, and he was borne off in another, both cheering.|$|E

6000|$|The cabman stared, but laughed. The heavy {{voice behind}} the wall said: [...] "Now then, a better back this time, Mr. Price." [...] And from {{the shadow of the}} wall Turnbull crept out. He had {{struggled}} wildly into his coat (leaving his waistcoat on the pavement), and he was with a fierce pale face climbing up the cab behind the cabman. MacIan had no glimmering notion of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to,</b> but an instinct of discipline, inherited from a hundred men of war, made him stick to his own part and trust the other man's.|$|E

6000|$|The {{intruder}} smiled tolerantly. He {{glanced around}} the room as though expecting to be asked to seat himself. No invitation of the sort, however, was accorded him. [...] "All's fair in love and politics, Lady Jane," [...] he declared. [...] "We Democrats have our programme, and our motto is that those who are not with us are against us.

50|$|The game {{begins with}} Kirby napping on a cloud, when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> awakened as a Waddle Dee walks by, {{carrying}} a round pinball-like bumper.

6000|$|... "Presently he calmed a little. 'Rats,' {{he said in}} an undertone, {{fingers on}} lips. He was evidently a little scared. I edged quietly out of the room, but a plank creaked. Then the infernal little brute started going all over the house, {{revolver}} in hand and locking door after door and pocketing the keys. When I realised <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> I had a fit of rage--I could hardly control myself sufficiently to watch my opportunity. By this time I knew he was alone in the house, and so I made no more ado, but knocked him on the head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They've hoofed out the prostitute. One {{night while}} we were away that old numskull Thornbury was doddering about the {{passages}} very late.

He communicated his suspicions next morning to Elliot, {{with the result that}} Rodriguez went to the woman and gave her twenty-four hours in which to clear out of the place. No one seems to have enquired into the truth of the story, or to have asked Thornbury and Elliot what business it was of theirs; they had it entirely their own way. I propose that we should all sign a Round Robin, go to Rodriguez in a body, and insist upon a full enquiry. Something's got to be done, don't you agree?" ...|$|E

Dogged if he didn't kiss me before I knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>to.</b> He said I was his chenerous gong friendt, and he begged my barton if he had said anything to wound me. I tell you it was an affecting scene, March; and rats enough round in that old barracks where he lives to fit out a first-class case of delirium tremens. What does he stay there for? He's not obliged to?" ...|$|E
