While several of Middleton's men <b>were</b> <b>hit,</b> no one was killed, and they all returned with the 7th Regiment back to Fort Bliss in late December 1915.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{costs of the}} war were high {{in some of the}} southern English colonies, including those that saw little military activity. Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania to a lesser extent, <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> hard by the cost of shipping their export products (primarily tobacco) to European markets, and they also suffered because of several particularly bad harvests. South Carolina accumulated a significant debt burden to finance military operations.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Routes 40 and 99 (soon 99W) {{were marked}} along Route 6 in 1928. These two routes {{remained}} on West Capitol Avenue until 1954, {{when the new}} West Sacramento Freeway opened, connecting {{the west end of}} the Tower Bridge with the east end of the Yolo Causeway. Traveler-oriented businesses along the bypassed West Capitol Avenue <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> hard by the shifting of through traffic.|$|E

50|$|The fiery Jennings {{was also}} {{known as one of}} the most fearless players of his time, {{allowing}} himself to <b>be</b> <b>hit</b> by pitches more than any other player. In one game, he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by a pitch three times. In 1896, he <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by pitches 51 times—a Major League record that still stands. In just five seasons with the Orioles from 1894 to 1898, Jennings <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by pitches an unprecedented 202 times. During one game, Jennings <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> in the head by a pitch from Amos Rusie in the 3rd inning, but managed to finish the game.

5|$|A third raid, {{consisting}} of six unescorted Hudsons of No. 62 Squadron RAF, flying from Palembang, Sumatra, attacked shortly afterwards, losing {{two of their}} number, with their entire crews, to six Ki-27s. A fourth raid, made up of five Bristol Blenheims of No. 27 Squadron RAF, set off from Palembang later in the day, but had only {{got as far as}} Singapore by sunset, so aborted the mission. Despite claims to have scored multiple hits on both transports and a cruiser, neither the transports, nor any of their escorts were damaged; the former <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> by splinters that killed 8 and wounded 18, but Sendai and the smaller ships were untouched.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the growing threat to the Australian base, the {{decision}} was made to reinforce FSB Andersen, with C Company, 3 RAR flown in by the time of the second attack two nights later. The APCs had also been redeployed to cover the south-east ridge and the southern approach from Trang Bom. The communist assault commenced just before midnight on 19 February, this time focussing on the south-east, and was preceded by heavy machine-gun fire. The attack was stopped short of the wire, regardless the forward pits <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> by rifle grenades, while the Assault Pioneer positions were attacked with satchel charges. The only casualties were four Viet Cong killed.|$|E

Big Brother then decided to take away all the personal stuff from Ema. In Week 2, Bojana <b>was</b> <b>hit</b> by an arrow (which was shot by Soraja) and had to do all of the house chores by herself.|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of World War Two the British Government created the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, and {{appointed}} Kenneth Clark as its Chairman. Despite the public hostility between Clarke and himself, Nevinson was disappointed not to be offered a commission by WAAC. He submitted three paintings to WAAC in December 1940 which were also rejected. He worked as a stretcher-bearer in London throughout the Blitz, during which his own studio and the family home in Hampstead <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> by bombs. WAAC eventually purchased two pictures from him, Anti-aircraft Defences and a depiction of a fire-bomb attack, The Fire of London, December 29th – An Historic Record.|$|E

On the 22 December 1940, the brewery water tanks <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> by bombs during the Manchester Blitz, and the brewery {{had to be}} closed down for several months, with production moved temporarily to the nearby Hydes Brewery. The brewery was rebuilt with the most up-to-date and modern equipment of the time, {{and was the first}} in Europe to install stainless steel brewing vats. In 1961, the brewer Whitbread took a 13 per cent stake in the company. In 1962 the company purchased Richard Clarke & Co of Reddish, Stockport, adding 60 public houses to the firm.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, several {{properties}} on Park Lane <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> by bombs. Dudley House, at No.100, suffered major structural damage, {{including the}} destruction of the ballroom and gallery, though the building was partially restored. However, the strength of construction of the Dorchester Hotel gave it the reputation of being one of London's safest buildings, and it was a safe haven for numerous luminaries. General Dwight D. Eisenhower took a suite on the first floor in 1942, and later made it his headquarters.|$|E

Shearer also became a regular in the England team this season and scored his second international goal; it came in a 4–0 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier win over Turkey in November. The season ended sourly, however, as Shearer was forced to miss January through to May due to injury and England's World Cup qualification chances <b>were</b> <b>hit</b> by a run of poor form.|$|E
