In his senior year, Cantrell became choir president, and the quartet sang the national anthem at basketball games and won competitions with the highest marks achievable. Cantrell has cited his interest in dark musical tones as dating back to this period: [...] "In choir <b>we</b> <b>performed</b> <b>a</b> cappella Gregorian chants from the 14th and 15th centuries. It was scary church music." [...] His choir teacher and drama teacher were, early on, his two greatest motivators toward a career in music. When Alice in Chains' first album went gold, Cantrell sent both teachers a gold record.|$|E
