5|$|During {{the course}} of the story, the two sides face off in a major battle that sees the deaths of many soldiers, {{including}} their leaders Larg and Goltana. Ramza manages to stop the bloodshed from continuing and rescues the general Cidolfas Orlandu, though the Church succeeds in eliminating the two Lions to secure its power over Ivalice. Deeper into the story, Ramza discovers that the Shrine Knights are in reality Lucavi, and the real conspirators behind the Church's plot. The Lucavi are seeking to resurrect their leader Altima, <b>who</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> was Saint Ajora, and they need much bloodshed and a suitable body to complete the resurrection. Alma is to serve as the host for Altima's incarnation. While racing off to find her, Ramza encounters Dycedarg - now a Lucavi demon - and witnesses Zalbag's death. Zalbag is then risen and converted into an undead servant, and frequently begs for death during the encounter.|$|E

Though he is from Khorassan and sways between allegiance to Nima Youshij and Akhavan Saless, in his poetry he shows the influences of Hafiz and Mowlavi. He uses simple, lyrical language and is mostly inspired by the political atmosphere. He is the most successful of those poets <b>who</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> four decades have tried {{hard to find a}} synthesis between the two models of Ahmad Shamloo and Nima Youshij.|$|E

Subsequently, ran for election to Dáil Éireann (the lower house) but her efforts were unsuccessful, as were her efforts to be elected to Dublin Corporation. Robinson, along {{with hundreds of thousands}} of other Irish people, clashed with Dublin Corporation when it planned to build its new administrative headquarters on Wood Quay, one of Europe's best preserved Viking sites. Though Robinson and people <b>who</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> might not have espoused her causes, fought a determined battle, Wood Quay was ultimately bulldozed and concreted over, to build the controversial Civic Offices.|$|E

25|$|There was {{excitement}} that The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News {{would be under}} local ownership {{for the first time}} since Walter Annenberg sold the paper to Knight Newspapers in 1969. The buyout was met with skepticism, however, among the employees at The Inquirer, who feared the new owners might threaten the editorial independence of the newspaper. Concerns were especially directed to Brian Tierney, <b>who</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> had criticized Inquirer reporters for doing negative stories about his clients during his time at Tierney Communications. Tierney allayed fears by having the members of Philadelphia Media Holdings sign a pledge not to interfere with the paper's editorial independence. Tierney said he would combat The Inquirers decreasing revenue and circulation by spending millions on advertisements and promotions and not by laying off staff.|$|E
25|$|Catastrophe is {{not only}} about a {{political}} situation and {{the place of the}} artist in it. The victim or “protagonist” is also representative of all actors, having to portray what writers write for them in the way directors tell them to do it (Beckett is not unaware of his own relationship with actors, particularly those <b>who</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> have resisted his stage directions). The director in the play catches two prototypes, that of the political commissar and of the all-powerful personality director like Peter Brook, Vitez, , who bend a performance to their own interpretation, where often the victim is the author himself; there are many “in” theatrical jokes. The director’s assistant coolly carries out her instructions, and it matters little if we are in a concentration camp or a film studio: all humane considerations are ruled out to achieve the ultimate work of art. The two-pronged metaphor is incredibly effective for all its surface simplicity. In time, as with all of Beckett’s work, more strands and allusions will be discovered.|$|E
500|$|The Johor Sultanate's {{title to}} the island was also {{confirmed}} by ties of loyalty that existed between the Sultanate and the Orang Laut, a nomadic sea people <b>who</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> had inhabited the maritime areas of the Singapore Strait, carrying out fishing and piracy, and had visited Pedra Branca quite frequently. This was evidenced by three 19th-century letters written by British officials, including one dated November 1850 by John Turnbull Thomson, the Government Surveyor of Singapore, which had reported {{on the need to}} exclude the Orang Laut from Pedra Branca where Horsburgh Lighthouse was being built. Thomson noted that they [...] "frequently visit the rock so their visits should never be encouraged nor any trust put in them ...

500|$|The kingdom was {{sometimes}} threatened by nomads; a letter sent to Yasmah-Adad informs him that 2000 Suteans conducted a raid against Qatna. Relations with Yamhad worsened during Išḫi-Addu's reign and the conflict evolved into border warfare; Qatna occupied {{the city of}} Parga {{in the region of}} Hamath for a while before Sumu-Epuh retook it. In the south, Išḫi-Addu faced a general rebellion; the alliance with Assyria was cemented by the marriage of Išḫi-Addu's daughter to Yasmah-Adad in [...] The following year, after petitions by Qatna, Shamshi-Adad sent an army to help Išḫi-Addu deal with the rebellion. The Assyrian troops avoided engaging Yamhad and did not participate in its war with Qatna, while Išḫi-Addu took up residence in Qadeš to oversee the suppression of the rebellion, which apparently was supported by Yamhad. After four years in the service of Qatna, Shamshi-Adad ordered his troops to return; this might have been connected to a peace treaty between Assyria and Yarim-Lim I, son of Sumu-Epuh. Išḫi-Addu, <b>who</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> had declared that [...] "even if Shamshi-Adad would conclude peace with Sumu-epuh, I will never make peace with Sumu-epuh, as long as I live!", was delivered a heavy blow, but Mari's sources are silent on how the king dealt with the situation, {{and by the time they}} resumed mentioning Qatna in , Išḫi-Addu was dead and succeeded by his son Amut-piʾel II.|$|E

EMTs operate under a limited scope of practice. EMTs are normally supervised by a medical director, who is a physician.|$|E
2500|$|Also, Śūraṅgama Sūtra, a major Mahayana Buddhism text, {{describes}} fifty demonic states: {{the so-called}} fifty skandha maras, which are [...] "negative" [...] mirror-like reflections of or deviations from correct samādhi (meditative absorption) states. In this context demons are considered by Buddhists to be beings possessing some supernatural powers, <b>who,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> might have practiced Dharma, Buddha's teaching, {{but due to}} practicing it incorrectly failed to develop Prajñā (Buddhism), true wisdom and Karuṇā, true compassion, which are inseparable attributes of an enlightened being such as a Buddha or a Bodhisattva. In his autobiography, The Blazing Splendor, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, a prominent Tibetan Buddhist master of the 20th century describes encounters with such beings. Therefore, depending on the context, in Buddhism demons may refer to both disturbed mind states and actual beings.|$|E

2500|$|Stage 19 was {{the final}} time trial. It was widely {{expected}} that Contador would increase his lead over Schleck, <b>who</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> had struggled in this discipline, but the initial going surprised all as Schleck set a high pace that Contador had difficulty matching.

By the second time check Contador had recovered his losses and extended his lead over Schleck by six seconds. Over the final third of the course Contador extended his advantage, gaining an additional twenty-five seconds on his rival for an overall gain of thirty-one seconds for the stage. [...] Fabian Cancellara, the Olympic and World Time Trial Champion, won the stage by seventeen seconds over runner-up Tony Martin. In addition Denis Menchov was able to overtake Samuel Sánchez for third place overall, while Ryder Hesjedal was able to move in front of Joaquim Rodríguez for the seventh place slot in the GC. Contador's first-place lead increased to 39 seconds, essentially guaranteeing him the victory.|$|E
2500|$|A {{small number}} of modern Jewish theologians, such as Yehezkel Kaufman and Rabbi Joseph H. Hertz, have {{suggested}} that perhaps only the Israelites were forbidden to worship idols, but perhaps such worship was permissible for members of other religions. (Yehezkel Kaufman, [...] "The Religion of Israel", Univ. of Chicago Press, 1960; J. H. Hertz, [...] "Pentateuch and Haftorahs" [...] Soncino Press, 1960, p.759). [...] Most Jewish theologians disagree, saying that the original {{meaning of the text}} was to condemn idolatry in total. However, a growing number of Jewish theologians question whether Hindus and Buddhists today should be considered idolaters in the Biblical sense of the term. Their reasons are that modern day Buddhists, Hindus and others (a) do not literally worship [...] "sticks and stones", as the idolaters in the Tanakh were described doing. Their beliefs have far more theological depth than ancient pagans, and they are well aware that icons they worship are only symbols of a deeper level of reality (though {{the same can be said}} of modern-day pagans), (b) they do not practice child sacrifice, (c) they are of high moral character, and (d) they are not anti-Jewish. Some Jews argue that God has a relationship with all gentile monotheists (or perceived monotheists), including Hindus, <b>who</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> may have been (mis)interpreted as having a polytheist faith (see also Hindu views on monotheism), as well as with members of other religions such as Buddhism.|$|E
2500|$|Faisal Kutty, a {{professor}} of Islamic law at Indiana-based Valparaiso University Law School and Toronto-based Osgoode Hall Law School, commented on the contemporary same-sex marriage debate in a March 27, 2014, essay in the Huffington Post. [...] He acknowledged that while Islamic law iterations prohibits pre- and extra-marital as well as same-sex [...] sexual activity, it does not attempt to [...] "regulate feelings, emotions and urges, but only its translation into action that authorities had declared unlawful". Kutty, who teaches comparative law and legal reasoning, also wrote that many Islamic scholars [...] have [...] "even argued that homosexual tendencies themselves were not haram [...] but had to be suppressed for the public good". [...] He claimed that {{this may not be}} [...] "what the LGBTQ community wants to hear", but that, [...] "it reveals that even classical Islamic jurists struggled with this issue and had a more sophisticated attitude than many contemporary Muslims". Kutty, <b>who</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> wrote in support of allowing Islamic principles in dispute resolution, also noted that [...] "most Muslims have no problem extending full human rights to those—even Muslims—who live together 'in sin'". [...] He argued that it therefore seems hypocritical to deny fundamental rights to same-sex couples. Moreover, he concurred with Islamic legal scholar Mohamed Fadel in arguing that this is not about changing Islamic marriage (nikah), but about making [...] "sure that all citizens have access to the same kinds of public benefits".|$|E
