5|$|It is {{important}} for us, my brothers, that we exterminate from our lands this nation which seeks only to destroy us.

25|$|Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, {{argued that}} all things have a {{universal}} form, {{which could be}} either a property or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple.

25|$|So <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{think of}} the {{category}} of real vector bundles on X as sitting inside the category of sheaves of OX-modules; this latter category is abelian, so this is where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> compute kernels and cokernels of morphisms of vector bundles.|$|E

25|$|The {{right-hand}} side constant requires four indices {{and is a}} fourth-rank quantity. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> also see that this quantity must be a tensor {{because it is a}} linear transformation that takes the strain tensor to the stress tensor. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> also show that the constant obeys the tensor transformation rules for fourth-rank tensors.|$|E
