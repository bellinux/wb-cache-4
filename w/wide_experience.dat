5|$|One of history's great Chiefs of Staff {{and a key}} {{member of}} the Imperial Staff, Schmitt was the most {{experienced}} Austrian leader, called out of retirement for this specific task of organizing the Austro-Russian retreat. He had <b>wide</b> <b>experience</b> as a leader: From the summer of 1796 {{until his retirement in}} 1800, he had been Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Army, of the Lower Rhine, the Rhine, and the Army of Germany, and a trusted member of Archduke Charles' staff. Consequently, he had organized a variety of maneuvers and battle plans under different terrain. The military historian Digby Smith hypothesizes that Schmitt, an experienced officer and sound tactician, would have been more effective at the Battle of Austerlitz, at least more effective than his replacement, Franz von Weyrother, as Chief of the Quartermaster General Staff of the Allied Army. After Schmitt's death, Weyrother, the architect of the Austrian defeat at Hohenlinden, developed the general battle plan of the Allied action at Austerlitz. In the long run, it was unlikely that Schmitt's plan would have changed the overall outcome—Austerlitz was arguably one of Napoleon's finest battles—but his battle plan would no doubt have been an improvement over the one the Allies used.|$|E

25|$|By 1882 {{nearly half}} the library was {{unrecorded}} in a catalog except {{in the shape of}} brief entries noted in manuscript in interleaved copies of the Cogswell catalog, and cards begun by Brevoort in 1876. A new author catalog was decided on, to include titles of all works received since the first catalog was published, and for this work Charles Alexander Nelson was hired in 1881. Nelson was a Harvard graduate fitted for this new task by service in the Harvard library and by a <b>wide</b> <b>experience</b> in the Boston book trade. The new printed catalog covered up to 1880. It had a fuller quotation of titles than the first one, a more extensive analysis of the contents of collected or comprehensive works, and greater attention to securing full names of authors. It appeared in four volumes, 1886–1888. As a catalog and as a printed book, it was a thoroughly satisfactory piece of work. The entire cost of printing was borne by John Jacob Astor III and amounted to nearly $40,000. With the publication complete, Nelson left the library in 1888.|$|E

500|$|In 1953 a {{religious}} education wing, also designed by Bailey, {{was added to}} the church building, increasing the size of the auditorium and adding classrooms and offices. [...] By the following year the church building had already reached its capacity and the congregation began holding two services on Sundays. [...] The church school, with an enrollment of over 500, also began holding two services on Sundays. [...] The church purchased adjoining property and in 1958 constructed the parsonage, a -story brick Colonial Revival building. [...] By 1959, there were eight Unitarian congregations in Washington, D.C.'s suburbs, with the Arlington church being the largest. [...] The congregation began planning for a new facility and chose Charles M. Goodman, a prominent local architect known for his modernist work, to design the church building. [...] A church committee wrote that it was [...] "confident that Mr. Goodman’s concept of design, his <b>wide</b> <b>experience,</b> and his original and creative genius promise for us a distinctive building which will portray in structural form the spirit and aspiration of this congregation." [...] Church leaders invited the congregation to give suggestions for Goodman's design which included [...] "an architectural style which would express the inspiring tradition of Unitarianism in Virginia" [...] and a [...] "free form and no stained glass, [...] a building to represent our cleavage with the past." [...] The congregation wanted the building to [...] "reflect their liberal, progressive beliefs and that would signify the UUCA's leadership position within the denomination." [...] According to one UUCA minister, [...] "Charles Goodman {{spent a lot of time}} with the congregation and incorporating the values and theology of the congregation into the design of the building." [...] Goodman finished his design in late 1961 and the church began seeking financing shortly thereafter. [...] His design included plans for a main sanctuary and adjoining wing, the latter which was not built at the time due to budget concerns. [...] Construction of the sanctuary was carried out by the Martin Brothers contracting firm. [...] The total cost was approximately $300,000, and the dedication was held on March 22, 1964, with a sermon by Dana McLean Greeley entitled [...] "Building a Faith for the Future." [...] UUCA's sanctuary is one of only three churches designed by Goodman and his only church building in Virginia. [...] His other two church designs are Bethesda United Church of Christ in Bethesda, Maryland, and Christ Church of Washington (now called Embassy Church) in Washington, D.C.|$|E

2500|$|On {{her return}} to London, Shubik learned {{that she had been}} {{appointed}} producer and story editor for the new anthology series. She obtained the services of George Spenton-Foster as her associate producer. Spenton-Foster was a science fiction fan and his <b>wide</b> <b>experience</b> of BBC television production proved invaluable to Shubik. By this stage, Shubik had found the twelve scripts she needed for the series: ten episodes would be adaptations of stories by John Wyndham ("Time to Rest" [...] and its sequel [...] "No Place Like Earth", dramatised together as “No Place Like Earth”); Alan Nourse ("The Counterfeit Man"); Isaac Asimov ("The Dead Past" [...] and Sucker Bait); William Tenn ("Time in Advance"); Ray Bradbury ("The Fox and the Forest"); Kate Wilhelm ("Andover and the Android"); John Brunner ("Some Lapse of Time"); J.G.

Among those commissioned to adapt the stories were a few notable names in television writing: Terry Nation, creator of the Daleks for Doctor Who and later Survivors and Blake's 7, adapted Bradbury's [...] "The Fox and the Forest" [...] while Troy Kennedy Martin, co-creator of Z-Cars, adapted Pohl's [...] "The Midas Plague".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the year}} 1848, McCord {{published}} {{her first book}} of poetry. My Dreams, a collection of fugitive poems, from the press of Carey & Hart, Philadelphia. A close study of these poems reveals a genuine poetic talent, {{but there is not}} the certainty of maturity, not the metrical perfection of first-rate poetry. The lyrist is an honestly doubting lyrist in many passages. There are a number of them that are either of adolescent composition, withheld until 1848 for publication, or at least of adolescent conception, possibly worked over for this volume. Hope is the keynote of a majority of the poems in this collection; but in many instances the hope is unaccompanied by any certainty of faith which a woman of McCord's full life and <b>wide</b> <b>experience</b> must have developed at the time this collection was published. A few of the poems are narrative myths, a direct reflection of her classic temperament. They suggest early Greek myths, and meet the reader with such titles as [...] "The Daughters of Hope," [...] who are cleverly personified as Fancy and Happiness, and, Happiness being lost in Life's confusion, Fancy assists her mother, Hope, to chase Happiness through all time. Others included [...] "The Falling Star," [...] "Love, Wisdom, Folly," [...] "The Comet," [...] "The Star That Followed Me," [...] "Conduct of the Sources of Good and Evil," [...] "The Home of Hope" [...] and [...] "The Voice of a Star." [...] Then there is a grouping possible among them of simple narratives of the world of concrete things. For example, the pathetic [...] "Poor Nannie" [...] and [...] "The Blood Stained Rose," [...] "The Birth of the Evergreens" [...] and [...] "Pretty Fanny." [...] But it is in the third division of these poems that McCord's maturity expresses her feelings, and in the poems of this group that deal with the eternal riddle of life and death. They suggest the suffering spirit. [...] "My Dream Child," [...] "The Village Churchyard," [...] "The First Beam of Light," [...] "My Dead," [...] "Ye're Born to Die" [...] and others are found here. Probably the best among them is [...] "The Voice of Years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bahá'í Joseph Sheppherd {{uses his}} <b>wide</b> <b>experience</b> living in many {{countries}} and professional knowledge as an anthropologist and archaeologist to write an embracing story about the adventures and discoveries of spiritual leaders bound to an island off Africa. The center pivotal periods of the story revolve around two generations of researchers: an archaeologist and his anthropologist daughter. Each in turn visits the same African island, but make vastly different discoveries as the story travels in four different time periods: humanity's distant past, near past, near future, and far future. Published in 1997 the near past and future are near enough to have their relative positions significantly altered - the 1970s {{for the first and}} the 2000s for the second, roughly now. This book is over 500 pages long and covers a wide range of topics in careful detail from the practicalities of stone axe making, through archeological digs in tyrannical third world countries, spiritual values expressed among aboriginal peoples {{of the world and the}} practical lives of individual people occasioned by mystical experiences and those around them, and so on. It follows the form of addressing life in different times and thus a kind of science fiction, but like other entries in this article emphasizes the inward issues and spiritual discoveries more than the quasi-magical or technological leaps made as part of the plot. Mr. Shepperd prefers the term [...] "social fiction" [...] rather than science fiction. The Bahá'ís, or any paraphrases of principles of the religion, are at best obliquely referred to until late in the second section, of the near past, when an Iranian Doctor mentions the Bahá’í Faith and his reasons for living in a place far from his home and how the principles of the religion stand in the context of the international challenges and needs of humanity. A key character in the book shows interest and later joins the religion but aside from a few specifics there is no clear statement of the future position of the religion nor how the future world culture was established (brief references to a dual process that has merged before the distant future, but doesn't state explicitly what place the Bahá’í Faith has in this pattern.) However, in the header of each section there is a text presented with a dating scheme that is exactly that of the Bahá'í calendar so for example 2007 of the common calendar is year 163 of the Bahá’í Era, or BE. While the textual reference is exact it only becomes clear when the two dating schemes are cross referenced and the explicit mention of the religion had already been made. Late in the story the Universal House of Justice is mentioned as having 19 members and a metropolis called Haifaakka is mentioned. However the Bahá'í Faith is not framed as the singular or dominant theme of the story - it is but an explicit component of the plot occasionally and a subtext for specifics recognizable but not identified as specifically related to the religion. In other words, the majority of the content of the book describes how the world at large arrives at a Bahá’í oriented future, but not how the Bahá’í Faith itself arrives to be in that position.|$|E
