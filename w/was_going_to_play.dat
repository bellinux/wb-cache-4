25|$|Initially, no studio would {{finance the}} film {{because of its}} {{potentially}} controversial and off-beat subject matter. After Drugstore Cowboy received favorable critical raves and awards, studios started to show some interest. However, they all wanted their own versions made and not Van Sant's. This frustration prompted the filmmaker to attempt the feature on a shoestring budget with a cast of actual street kids filling out the roles including Michael Parker and actor Rodney Harvey, who <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Scott.|$|E

In addition, [...] "Welcome Wagon" [...] is the first appearance of the character of Moe Flater.

She's a terrific actress and a great dancer, but she's not this character. She's not the little six-year-old girl Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz." [...] Though 20th Century Fox had financially backed the stage musical, they ended up exercising their first refusal rights to the film production, which gave Universal an opening to finance the film.

On March 30, {{he was placed}} on waivers by the Mariners {{to make room for}} Mike Sweeney of the 25-man roster. Geoff Baker, {{reporter}} for The Seattle Times, stated that the reason for Garko being placed on waivers was because of Sweeney's clubhouse presence {{and the fact that the}} Mariners had stated that, due to his defensive abilities, Casey Kotchman, whom Garko was expected to split playing time with, <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the majority of the games at first base leaving the back-up designated hitter spot for Garko.

Silveria explained, [...] "We went in really fresh, and we wanted to get it done quickly to capture that moment.

Insomniac wanted to retain brand ownership, causing some firms to opt out of publishing it. Murray and Smith traveled to Microsoft Studios a number of times to pitch the game to them. The main pitch began with the playing of [...] "Kick Out the Jams" [...] by MC5, and ended with Murray: [...] "...on top of a chair, mimicking how the game <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> and the last minute heroics." [...] Microsoft was eager to work with Insomniac and agreed to fund and publish the game.

500|$|Michael Keaton {{returned}} after {{a significant increase}} in his salary to $10 million. Annette Bening was cast as Catwoman after Burton saw her performance in The Grifters, but she dropped out due to her pregnancy. Raquel Welch, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Madonna, Ellen Barkin, Cher, Bridget Fonda, Lorraine Bracco, Jennifer Beals and Susan Sarandon were then in competition for the role. Sean Young, who was originally chosen for Vicki Vale in the previous film, believed the role should have gone to her. Young visited production offices dressed in a homemade Catwoman costume, demanding an audition. Burton was unfamiliar with Michelle Pfeiffer's work, but was convinced to cast her after one meeting. Pfeiffer received a $3 million salary, $2 million more than Bening, and a percentage of the box office. The actress undertook kickboxing lessons for the role. Kathy Long served as Pfeiffer's body double. On Danny DeVito's casting, Waters explained, [...] "I kind of knew that DeVito <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> The Penguin.

In May 2000, The Smashing Pumpkins disbanded and Auf der Maur did not have plans to continue her music career.

The film was co-produced by new producer R. Ravindran, and the first schedule began with Karthi, whose first film, Paruthiveeran, was awaiting release, and Sandhya. The film was stalled in early 2007 due to cinematographer Arvind Krishna's decision to leave White Elephants and the project was eventually shelved. In July 2007, Selvaraghavan announced a new film with a new team of Karthi and Reemma Sen in the cast, with Ramji replacing regular Arvind Krishna as the cinematographer. Erum Ali, wife of actor Abbas, became the team's head costume designer, whilst, Selvaraghavan's sister-in-law and Rajinikanth's daughter, Aishwarya Dhanush, was signed on as an associate director. The film was named after a popular M. G. Ramachandran film, Aayirathil Oruvan. The producer was announced to be R. Ravindran whilst Yuvan Shankar Raja was appointed as music director following five previous successful soundtracks in Selvaraghavan films. Despite early indications that the director's brother Dhanush <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a guest role, it became evident that the role was subsequently given to R. Parthiepan.
