There were four million freedmen {{and most of them}} on the same plantation, doing the same <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did before emancipation, except as their work had been interrupted and changed by the upheaval of war. Moreover, they were getting about the same wages and apparently were going to be subject to slave codes modified only in name. There were among them thousands of fugitives in the camps of the soldiers or {{on the streets of the}} cities, homeless, sick, and impoverished. They had been freed practically with no land nor money, and, save in exceptional cases, without legal status, and without protection.|$|E
5|$|The first {{excavations}} at Volubilis {{were carried}} out by the French archaeologist Henri de la Martinière between 1887 and 1892. In 1915 Hubert Lyautey, the military governor of French Morocco, commissioned the French archaeologists Marcel and Jane Dieulafoy to carry out excavations in Volubilis. Although Jane's ill-health meant that they were unable to carry out the programme of <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> drew up for Lyautey, the work went ahead anyway under Louis Chatelain. The French archaeologists were assisted by thousands of German prisoners of war who had been captured during First World War and loaned to the excavators by Lyautey. The excavations continued on and off until 1941, when the Second World War forced a halt.|$|E

25|$|Newar {{artists were}} the most sought after among the foreign artists living in Tibet. French missionary {{traveller}} Évariste Régis Huc has written that it is they who construct for the Buddhist temples those fine roofs of gilt plates, which resist all the inclemencies of the seasons and always retain a marvellous freshness and glitter. They are so skilful at this class of <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are sent to the very interior of Tartary to decorate the Lamaseries.|$|E
25|$|Shoujo, as a tradition, {{is defined}} by this {{contrast}} against a prevailing and dominant masculine culture. Its female-ness is incalculable and omnipresent. Rather than taking comfort {{in the knowledge that}} this difference exists, Hagio uses her narratives to question its very foundation, specifically, gender. By undermining the reader's sense of gender and applying scrutiny to the interpretive structures related to it, she is calling into question the very conventions that define the <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are reading.|$|E
25|$|Rioting {{began on}} September 1, 1934, when seven prisoners {{refused to do}} their {{assigned}} work. By September 10, 73 prisoners were striking. Furniture and toilets were smashed, as well as 182 windows. The riot ended on September 12 when its leaders were paddled. The inmates were protesting generally poor conditions, and were also demanding that they be paid for the <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did. The riot was instrumental to the Canadian government implementing a policy of paying its federal inmates five cents per day.|$|E

25|$|On 29 November, Vaublanc was {{assigned}} {{the task of}} composing {{a message to the}} King, asking him to withdraw his veto of the decree of 9 November, a decree designed to slow the massive emigrations (then encouraged by the priests and the nobility) by threatening reprisals against German princes who continued to offer refuge to the armies of French noblemen (such as those of the Comte d'Artois, and of the Prince of Condé). The assembly was so pleased with his <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> asked him to read it to the King personally. Louis XVI replied that he would take the request into serious consideration, and, several days later, personally announced his decision on the matter.|$|E
25|$|False {{memories}} {{result from}} persistent beliefs, suggestions via authority figures, or statements of false information. Repeated exposure to these stimuli influence {{the reorganization of}} a person's memory, affecting its details, or implanting vivid false accounts of an event. This is usually accounted for by source-monitoring error, where a person can recall specific facts, but cannot correctly identify the source of that knowledge because of apparent loss of the association between the episodic (specific experience, or source) and semantic (concept-based, or gist) accounts of the stored knowledge. An {{example of this is}} cryptomnesia, or inadvertent plagiarism, where one duplicates a <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have previously encountered believing it to be their original idea. False memories can also be accounted for by the generation effect, which is an observable phenomenon where repeated exposure to a belief, suggestion, or false information is better remembered with each subsequent generation. This can be seen with the misinformation effect, where an eye-witness account of an event can be influenced by a bystander account of the same event, or by suggestion via an authority figure. It is also believed to influence the recovery of repressed shocking or abusive memories in patients under hypnosis, where the recovered memory, although possibly a vivid account, could be entirely false, or have specific details influenced as the result of persistent suggestion by the therapist.|$|E
60|$|The French were {{confident}} in being commanded by their {{best and most}} popular generals, Villars and Boufflers.

500|$|Another poem {{published}} by Henry was [...] "Lines on a Pocket Book", {{in which he}} considers John Allan's accusations that younger sister Rosalie Poe was illegitimate. Henry's poems generally have themes of melancholy, despair, and feature women who die and abandon their loved ones who dream of their reunion. Many are so similar to Poe's early <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may have been collaborative efforts. His writing career ended in 1827 when the North American Review ceased publication.|$|E
500|$|According to Laybourne Smith, {{he became}} {{interested}} in machinery while in the goldfields. His parents decided to direct him towards architecture, as it [...] "was the nearest thing to white-collar engineering <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could think of". He was articled to A. A. E. Dancker for a period before returning to Adelaide in 1898. Laybourne Smith's parents had intended for him to study architecture at the University of Adelaide, {{but there were no}} courses available at the time. As a result, Laybourne Smith undertook to complete a mechanical engineering course part-time at the School of Mines, and (in order to pursue his interest in architecture) he was articled to Edward Davies from 1901.|$|E
500|$|On {{arrival in}} London, Bohr rejoined his father, who had flown to Britain the week before. He officially became a junior {{researcher}} at the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, [...] but actually served as personal assistant and secretary to his father. The two worked on Tube Alloys, the British atomic bomb project. On 30 December 1943, they made {{the first of a}} number of visits to the United States, where his father was a consultant to the Manhattan Project. Due to his father's fame, they were given false names; Bohr became James Baker, and his father, Nicholas Baker. In 1945, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, Robert Oppenheimer, asked them to review the design of the modulated neutron initiator. They reported that it would <b>work.</b> <b>That</b> <b>they</b> had reached this conclusion put Enrico Fermi's concerns about the viability of the design to rest. The initiators performed flawlessly in the bombs used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.|$|E

500|$|Denning {{gave the}} leading {{judgment}} in D & C Builders Ltd v Rees [...] 2 QB 617 in 1965. D & C Builders Ltd (the respondent) {{had been hired}} by Rees (the appellant) to do some construction work at his shop, where he sold building materials. EWCA Civ 3 (12 November 1965) |publisher=BAILII|accessdate=6 May 2009}} The respondent finished the work and repeatedly phoned the appellant to request the money they were owed. After three phone calls spread out over several months the appellant's wife spoke to the respondents; she said there were several problems with the <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had done, and she would only pay £300 of the £482 owed. The respondents replied that £300 would barely {{cover the costs of}} the materials, but that they would accept it anyway. If the respondents had not received the money they would have gone bankrupt, something the appellant's wife was well aware of. In his judgment, Denning modified English case law on part payment and accord and satisfaction, saying that the rules on part payment can be set aside in situations where one of the parties is under duress. The fact that D & C Builders were effectively forced into accepting the lesser amount meant that the payment was not valid.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack is {{composed}} by the electronic musician Amon Tobin, composers James Dooley and Mel Wesson, and electric cellist Martin Tillman, {{under the direction}} of Sony's music manager, Jonathan Mayer. Tobin was specifically brought on board due to his recent trend of blurring the lines between music and sound design as exhibited in his then-recent album, Foley Room. Instead of using traditional instruments, the team sought to use sounds that results from objects that would be found in an urban environment and using such objects in combination with other instruments used in non-traditional manners; for example, bungee cords were strung alongside a bass drum and strummed, and wire brushes were hit against a suspended tuba. The music was divided between Tobin, who worked on the in-game music, and Dooley who worked on the music for the cinematics; the two worked together to make sure common musical themes were present in both aspects. Tillman was brought in late to the process to add the cello sounds, but the group was so impressed with his <b>work</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> remixed already-completed pieces to incorporate his contribution further. Manchester music group, Working for a Nuclear Free City were commissioned by Sony to produce a song for the game. The song was penned [...] "Silent Melody" [...] and was used in one of the game's promotional trailers. The soundtrack was released for digital download from the iTunes Store in May 2009.|$|E
