[...] Lieutenant General Timothy Maude, a point man on LGBT issues for the U.S. Army, visited with Patricia Kutteles. Despite campaigning by the Kutteleses and LGBT activist groups, the Commanding General of Fort Campbell {{at the time of}} the murder, Major General Robert T. Clark, refused to take responsibility for the purported anti-gay climate at Fort Campbell under his command. In May 2003, he met with Patricia Kutteles, who opposed his promotion saying: [...] "He doesn't have the command authority or responsibility. The promotion would be another obstacle in the way of everything <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to do to honor our son."

We have forgotten the wisdom which says that since we cannot foresee where any road will lead in the end, we should stick to the straight and honest one." [...] Despite the prevailing pacifism of the time – and he exchanged views with [...] "passive pacifists" [...] in the correspondence-columns – such sentiments struck a chord. [...] "This is the voice of the England I love," [...] wrote a correspondent from Prague in 1938, [...] "and for whose soul I was trembling when I heard about the welcome given Mr Chamberlain on his return from Munich." [...] Not everyone admired the letters, however: the pro-appeasement Times refused to publish him after 1935 (he described the Editor's office as [...] "an annexe of the German embassy"), and when he condemned the Italian invasion of Abyssinia and the democracies' inadequate response, he received abusive and threatening replies from Fascists, including one from Ezra Pound.

Whereas for the band's EP releases Barlow [...] "had some shit going on that I needed to get off my chest". The band [...] "worked incredibly hard" [...] to make an album that reaches high standards set by other artists' albums that Hopeless have released. Rock Sound contributor Rob Sayce noted that the album was influenced by All Time Low's Nothing Personal (2009). Sayce wrote that the band [...] "gave British pop-punk a shot in the arm, drawing on the production sheen of 'Nothing Personal.'" [...] "Losing Teeth" [...] is about how Barlow and his friends were pursuing careers that would take them away from their hometown. Barlow said it wasn't [...] "about the end of our youth, as such, but definitely the end of us being kids, and reflecting on that." [...] "Growing Pains" [...] was the band's first attempt at [...] "diversity <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to implement", according to Thorpe-Evans. Thorpe-Evans mentioned that the group felt the song [...] "has a flair of originality and uniqueness" [...] when compared to the previous output.

Dorfman suspects the attempt to subvert Che could backfire, positing that 3billion people now live on less than $2 a day and thus [...] "the powerful of the earth should take heed: deep inside that T shirt where <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to trap him, the eyes of Che Guevara are still burning with impatience." [...] Expressing a similar sentiment, director Jonathan Green acknowledges that [...] "Che is turning over in his grave" [...] because of the commercialization; in Green's view, Che's visage also {{has the potential to}} be a [...] "Trojan horse" [...] of capitalist marketing, by embedding itself into pop iconography. In his example, corporations in their desperate drive to sell goods, create the opportunity for observers to see the [...] "logo" [...] and ask [...] "who was that guy?" [...] Trisha Ziff, curator of Che! Revolution and Commerce believes that regardless of the [...] "postmodern" [...] diffusion, you can't disassociate Che from [...] "radical ideas and change", nor can one control it. In Ziff's view, despite the endless array of merchandising, the symbol of Che will continue to be worn and have resonance. Critical pedagogical theorist Peter McLaren theorizes that American capitalism is responsible for the Che phenomenon, stating that [...] "the United States has a seductive way of incorporating anything that it can't defeat and transforming that 'thing' into a weaker version of itself, much like the process of diluting the strength and efficacy of a virus through the creation of a vaccine." [...] Neo-Marxist and critical theorist Herbert Marcuse argued that in the contemporary capitalist world there is no escaping such co-optation, theorizing that we are made [...] "one-dimensional" [...] by capitalism's single-minded orientation toward greed and growth.
