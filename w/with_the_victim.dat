5|$|Meanwhile, Munch and Kellerman {{investigate}} a murder at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during a late-season baseball game, leaving 48,000 possible suspects. The Long Island man, presumably a Yankees fan, is found {{beaten to death}} on the stairs of the stadium, and the governor of Maryland pressures the police department to solve the murder before the game ends so that millions in tourism dollars and ticket revenues will not be jeopardized. After several fruitless interviews, Munch and Kellerman question Scott Russell (Brian Tarantina), a New Yorker who attended the game <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> Russell admits he killed the victim because he said the Baltimore Orioles were a better team than the Yankees. He agrees to confess to the murder if they let him watch {{the rest of the}} game. Back at the police department, Falsone continues questioning detectives about the Luther Mahoney shooting. Stivers expresses concern to Lewis that their covering for Kellerman's role in the shooting could bring both of them down if Falsone continues his questioning.|$|E

The book details {{allegations}} of police misconduct and intimidation by Prosecutor Crane. There are also accounts of bogus police reports and alleged witnesses claiming that affidavits against Ferguson were signed in their names. D'Ambrosio proposes alternate theories and examines the allegations against Michael Boyd, the final person to speak <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> The case has been featured on 48 Hours, Dateline, and numerous other newspapers and media outlets.|$|E

25|$|A {{somewhat}} different contextual effect {{stemmed from the}} recently made distinction between thematical and sudden appearance of an emotionally arousing event, suggesting that the occurrence of memory impairments depends {{on the way the}} emotional stimuli are induced. Laney et al. (2003) argued that when arousal is induced thematically (i.e., not through the sudden appearance of a discrete shocking stimulus such as a weapon but rather through involvement in an unfolding event plot and empathy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> as his or her plight becomes increasingly apparent), memory enhancements of details central to the emotional stimulus need not {{come at the expense of}} memory impairment of peripheral details.|$|E
25|$|Following their arrest, Parry {{eventually}} {{confessed to}} {{having been in}} a relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> {{and that she had}} attacked Gilford (albeit without intent to kill) following an argument. McLauchlan agreed that her account of events was true, though {{by the time of the}} trial both had unsuccessfully attempted to withdraw the confession, claiming that they had been intimidated, deprived of sleep and subjected to threats of sexual violence in order to coerce them into signing it. Prior to the trial, the lawyers for the two nurses discovered similarities between Gilford's death and the 1994 murder of Liberty de Guzman, another nurse at the same complex, but that case was judged to not be relevant to the trial.|$|E
25|$|Many of the victims' bodies bore {{evidence}} of mutilation {{to the eye}} sockets. Pathologists concluded the injuries were caused by a knife, leading investigators to the conclusion the killer had gouged out {{the eyes of his}} victims. Chikatilo's adult female victims were often prostitutes or homeless women whom he would lure to secluded areas with promises of alcohol or money. Chikatilo would typically attempt intercourse with these victims, but he would usually be unable to achieve or maintain an erection; this would send him into a murderous fury, particularly if the woman mocked his impotence. He would achieve orgasm only when he stabbed and slashed the victim to death. His child and adolescent victims were of both sexes; Chikatilo would lure these victims to secluded areas using a variety of ruses, usually formed in the initial conversation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> such as promising them assistance or company, or offering to show them a shortcut, a chance to view rare stamps, films or coins, or with an offer of food or candy. He would usually overpower these victims once they were alone, often tying their hands behind their backs with a length of rope before stuffing mud or loam into the victims' mouth to silence their screams, and then proceed to kill them. After the killing, Chikatilo would make rudimentary—though seldom serious—efforts to conceal the body before leaving the crime scene.|$|E

500|$|... "Mr. Monk Gets a New Shrink" [...] {{was written}} by Hy Conrad and {{directed}} by Andrei Belgrader. The idea of hiding the crucial piece of evidence in a vacuum bag {{had been on the}} writing table for years at the time that this episode was written. The writers' problem was that they could not get a realistic idea on how to use it. One idea had actually been to have a killer hack up his victim, place the dismembered limbs into a self-cleaning oven, then vacuum out the remains and have the bag filled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> The writers saw this possibility as too gruesome for the show. Other ideas had included hiding something valuable in the bag and having the killer stalk Monk while trying to recover it.|$|E
500|$|The {{shooting}} of Officer Thormann was also adapted from true-life events in Simon's book, although Homicide writers added the twist of Crosetti taking the case personally {{based on his}} close friendship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> Edie Falco made a guest appearance in [...] "A Shot in the Dark" [...] as Officer Thormann's wife Eva. Fontana cast Falco after watching her performance in Laws of Gravity (1992). Fontana said of her, [...] "She's an actress who's unadorned by any embroidery. She does everything with such simplicity and honesty, it's breathtaking." [...] Falco was a struggling actor at the time, and said her salary from one Homicide episode paid for one month's worth of rent. Fontana cast Falco as a regular in his HBO series Oz based on her work in the Homicide episodes.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{continues}} the story {{arc of the}} Adena Watson murder case, which {{was introduced in the}} final scene of series premiere [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] and dominates much of the Homicide: Life on the Street first season. The Watson case was based on the real-life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which is chronicled in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. The investigation into Calpurnia Church was inspired by the real-life case of Geraldine Parrish, which was featured in Simon's book. Parrish was accused of killing five husbands for insurance money and was eventually convicted for three of their deaths. The shooting of Officer Thormann was also adapted from true-life events in Simon's book, although Homicide writers added the twist of Crosetti taking the case personally based on his close friendship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b>|$|E

He has declined to say whether he had been contaminated with polonium-210. The Crown Prosecution Service has charged him with murder and has sent an extradition request to Russia that includes a summary of the evidence, but the only third party to have seen the extradition request, American journalist Edward Epstein, has described the substantiation as [...] "embarrassingly thin".|$|E
500|$|After {{questioning}} {{several of}} Mahoney's former associates, drug supplier Wilkie Collins (Robert F. Chew) is pressured into telling Lewis and Falsone the shooter was Mahoney's nephew, Junior Bunk (Mekhi Phifer). They arrest Junior Bunk {{and find the}} matching gun, a Desert Eagle pistol prompting Bunk to admit he shot at the police to [...] "send a message" [...] from his mother, Georgia Rae Mahoney (Hazelle Goodman), {{over the death of}} her brother, Luther. Georgia is arrested trying to flee in a jet to the Cayman Islands, where she used to handle Luther's drug money. Meanwhile, following Brierre's autopsy, Cox (Michelle Forbes) finds somebody had consensual sex <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> before her death. Pembleton and Bayliss learn from Felix Wilson's daughter Thea (Ellen Bethea) that Brierre had a vicious and abusive ex-boyfriend named Kaja. Pembleton and Gee declare Kaja the primary suspect, despite protests from Ballard that the lead is thin and that they have not properly questioned Felix Wilson. The episode ends with an imprisoned Georgia Rae Mahoney stating Kellerman will hear from her soon.|$|E

500|$|The {{shooting}} of Officer Thormann {{was adapted from}} true-life events in chronicled in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. Homicide writers added the twist of Crosetti taking the case personally based on his close friendship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> As the first season of Homicide progressed, NBC officials complained to the show's producers about {{the large number of}} protracted, interwoven subplots going on during each given episode. [...] "A Dog and Pony Show" [...] in particular refers to the Adena Watson murder, which was featured in five previous episodes and resolved in [...] "Three Men and Adena", as well as the romance between Bolander and Blythe, which had been progressing throughout the first season. Additionally, the [...] "Pony" [...] Johnson subplot started in [...] "A Dog and Pony Show" [...] would not become resolved until the next episode, [...] "And the Rockets Dead Glare." [...] By the beginning of the , the Homicide producers bowed to network pressure and were forced {{to reduce the number of}} subplots in each episode.|$|E
500|$|... "Gone for Goode" [...] {{included}} several storylines, and even exact bits of dialogue, adapted straight from Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. One {{of the biggest}} story arcs from the first season was the murder of 11-year-old Adena Watson, which is introduced in [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] and lasts for five episodes until [...] "Three Men and Adena". The case {{was based on the}} murder of 11-year-old Latonya Kim Wallace, which made up a major part of Simon's book. The Watson case, like the Wallace case, ultimately goes unsolved. A subplot from [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] and [...] "Son of a Gun" [...] involved the investigation into Calpurnia Smith, an elderly woman suspected of murdering five husbands in order to collect their life insurance policies. This was based on the real-life case of Geraldine Parrish, who was also accused of killing five husbands for insurance money, and was eventually convicted for three of their murders. Another multi-episode arc involved the near-fatal shooting of Patrolman Chris Thormann, which leaves the officer blind. This was also adapted from true-life events in Simon's book, although Homicide writers added the twist of Steve Crosetti taking the case personally based on his close friendship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b>|$|E
