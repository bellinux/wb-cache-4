40|$|Searching through literature, we {{can find}} several {{different}} definitions of the term giftedness. One of the aspects that influenced the selection if this topic is also the field of mathematical giftedness. The purpose of this thesis is a qualitative research of <b>working</b> <b>with</b> gifted pupils in the subject of mathematics in various European countries. I have researched the techniques used in <b>working</b> <b>with</b> gifted <b>children</b> by selected teachers from various European countries, {{as well as the}} types of activities they prepare for them to use in class. Using a questionnaire, filled in by five mathematics teachers from four different European countries, I wished to explore their experiences <b>with</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> gifted <b>children.</b> I was also interested in their thoughts on the way their school system deals <b>with</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> gifted <b>children.</b> I have discovered that most teachers do not feel they are qualified enough to be <b>working</b> <b>with</b> gifted <b>children,</b> which poses the question on how to train teachers to better cope with the challenge at hand. Teachers believe the two most important factors, which influence the quality of <b>working</b> <b>with</b> gifted <b>children,</b> are teachers themselves and the school system. According to the teachers, who filled in the questionnaire, it turns out that several countries do not take appropriate measures in successfully dealing <b>with</b> gifted <b>children.</b> All of the selected teachers have positive experiences <b>with</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> gifted <b>children.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|To {{allow the}} {{introduction}} of the database, the government required all local authorities to implement the Integrated Children's System, a framework to help improve outcomes for children. The government set a deadline of 1 January 2007, and 92 out of the 150 local authorities failed to achieve this. The government began a consultation on the 2007 draft regulations on 21 September 2006 which ended on 14 December 2006. In October 2006, the government selected Capgemini to design the database. On 15 February 2007, the database was renamed from Information Sharing Index to ContactPoint, following research with stakeholder groups, including children and families, who decided that the name ContactPoint made clear what the purpose of the database was: to improve communication between those <b>working</b> <b>with</b> <b>children.</b> A consultation on a guide for database users was launched on 4 May 2007 and ended on 27 July 2007.|$|E

40|$|Work {{and family}} embody {{two of the}} most {{fundamental}} areas of adult life. The increased participation in the labour force of <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> <b>children</b> has had a major impact on the work and family interface. Theories of work and family have been incorporated to analyse potential relationships of conflict with undesirable work outcomes such as reduced job satisfaction and burnout. The study investigates whether work-family conflict ultimately leads to <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> children’s experiences of burnout and lower job satisfaction. The research study also explores the effects of the mother-role identity on the manifestation of family and work conflict in <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> <b>children</b> and posits that <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> <b>children</b> experience role salience differently from other working women without children. The study employed a quantitative research design using electronic self-administered questionnaires. Using the data from 545 employees in a fast-moving consumer goods industry showed that <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> <b>children</b> who identified closer with the mother-role identity, experienced greater work-family conflict. The mother-role identity forms a greater part of <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> children’s self than that of the employee-role identity and the results infer that role identity plays a significant role when conflict is experienced. In <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> <b>children,</b> strong relationships were found between family-work conflict and burnout, and moderate inverse relationships between work-family conflict and job satisfaction. Work-family conflict may ultimately lead <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> <b>children</b> to experience higher burnout and lower job satisfaction owing to their preoccupation with family-related responsibilities. The concept of role identity is introduced as a significant variable to consider into the work and family conflict investigation, {{as well as in the}} development of burnout and job satisfaction for <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> <b>children.</b> The current research also assists in understanding the work and family role integration of <b>working</b> women <b>with</b> <b>children</b> and provides a consolidated overview of the current work and family theories within a conceptual and unifying model. This research offers an explanatory model that outlines the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, by investigating the mechanisms by virtue of which such relationships exist.
