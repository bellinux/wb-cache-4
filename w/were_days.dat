5|$|Odin Sphere {{released}} in North America on May 22, 2007, {{less than a}} week after the game's Japanese release. In Europe, it was released on March 14, 2008 by Square Enix. Available with in-game text in English, French, German, Spanish and Italian, it was the first non-Square Enix title the company {{released in}} Europe. The European version also included technical improvements that allowed the game to run better than the North American version. It was also published in Australia on March 13. The Japanese voice track was included in the game as a special extra feature for fans of anime. The localization process was timed so that the Japanese and North American releases <b>were</b> <b>days</b> apart rather than months, which put extra pressure due to some promotional assets still being in development in Japan.|$|E
25|$|The Yellow Fever in Buenos Aires was {{a series}} of {{epidemics}} that took place in 1852, 1858, 1870 and 1871, the latter being a disaster that killed about 8% of Porteños: in a city were the daily death rate was less than 20, there <b>were</b> <b>days</b> that killed more than 500 people. The Yellow Fever would have come from Asunción, Paraguay, brought by Argentine soldiers returning from the war just fought in that country, having previously spread in the city of Corrientes. As its worst, Buenos Aires population was reduced to a third because of the exodus of those escaping the scourge.|$|E

In 1994, Cruise starred along with Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater in Neil Jordan's Interview with the Vampire, a gothic drama/horror film {{that was based on}} Anne Rice's best-selling novel. The film was well received, {{although}} Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as Julian Sands was her first choice. Upon seeing the film however, she paid $7,740 for a two-page ad in Daily Variety praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.|$|E

Picked {{for only about}} half the first-team matches in 1955 and overtaken by both Bannister and Thompson, he took only 38 wickets and his average was more than 30 runs per wicket, high for this period of English cricket. In 1956, there <b>were</b> <b>days</b> of individual triumph: against Gloucestershire, he took five wickets for 77 runs; against Kent he again took three wickets in three balls, a second hat-trick.

500|$|When {{the band}} {{completed}} writing and recording demos for the songs, the three headed to Los Angeles to record drum tracks at Chick Corea's Mad Hatter Studios in January 1999. Barker recorded {{the majority of}} his drum tracks in eight hours. The recording process for the album was completed over a period of four months, and production was handled at several production facilities in southern California, including Signature Sound and Studio West in San Diego, Big Fish Studios in Encinitas, and Conway Recording Studios and The Bomb Factory in Los Angeles. For Barker, the album was [...] "fueled by black coffee and Marlboro Lights"; he was hopeful for the album as the band were well-rehearsed and no time would be wasted. To record Enema of the State, Blink-182 turned to punk rock producer Jerry Finn, who previously worked on Green Day's breakthrough album, Dookie (1994). Hoppus and DeLonge were impressed with his work when they recorded [...] "Mutt" [...] for its placement on the American Pie soundtrack. Finn was harder on the trio to record better takes, and Hoppus credited Finn with knowing a great deal about punk rock music, but also helping the band establish a more pop-inspired sound. Finn came with an array of amps, effects and equipments; previously the band were forced to rent such equipment. Barker kept attempting to irritate Finn by sneaking in vibraslaps, which Finn hated. In addition, the band had so much fun with Finn that there <b>were</b> <b>days</b> when very little work was accomplished: [...] "Recording can get pretty monotonous, but at least we could laugh with Jerry," [...] recalled Hoppus. [...] "A pretty typical day would involve multiple takes for one part of one song, and then everyone would get naked and jump on Jerry." [...] The band chose [...] "never to work with anyone else again," [...] and Finn would produce their next three releases.|$|E

But there <b>were</b> <b>days</b> when I thought, 'I'm about to do a scene with this cinema legend, am I up to it?' But people were very gracious.

2500|$|Though Westbrook {{initially}} enjoyed {{her time}} {{back at the}} soap, {{she was unable to}} keep her working life and private life separate. Off-screen, her partying and drug-use (both in and out of work) began to affect her performance. Her cast mates attempted to curtail the problem. Actors such as Wendy Richard and Mike Reid requested that Westbrook's dressing room be situated near theirs and away from the younger cast, because they could see she was [...] "vulnerable". They attempted {{to talk to her about}} her drug problem, but Westbrook ignored their concerns and continued using. She has revealed that she became so affected by cocaine that she would continuously mess up her lines, had to do take after take, was constantly late and needed prompts, and spontaneously fell asleep, once even passing out while she stood at the top of the Queen Vic stairs during filming, and was only saved from harming herself by Ross Kemp who caught her in his arms. She has commented, [...] "When I watch re-runs of those scenes now I can't believe how out of it I look." [...] Many of the newer, younger cast members began to shun her, laughing at her and throwing peanuts at her during filming every time she attempted to deliver her lines. Eventually, the producers tired of Westbrook. She has revealed: [...] "the producers now had serious doubts about my future on the soap. I was proving to be a liability. My behaviour was interfering with the schedule. It was interfering with other cast members' work. There <b>were</b> <b>days</b> when I just didn't bother showing up for work at all. The dilemma they faced was what to do with me. They had only just written [...] back into the soap; now, within months, they were having to write her out of it all over again. They felt bad about getting rid of me, too. I could tell they felt responsible for me but of course ultimately there wasn't much they could do to help [...] Within a couple of weeks I was called into a meeting and told very politely that they were going to let me go early and terminate my contract. They would, they explained, gradually write my character out of the scripts again, which would take a couple of months to do." ...|$|E
