The Medical Examining Board and state Department of Licensing and Regulation investigated the doctors. The medical school reviewed 22 doctors said to have been involved in giving medical excuses to protesters at the Capitol. At least a dozen doctors received disciplinary action in late April or early May. Some of the doctors appealed, and most cases were resolved by early July. The Wisconsin Medical Society criticized the doctors' actions, saying they threatened the public's trust in the medical profession. The state Department of Safety and Professional Services reviewed 11 doctors said to have written sick notes and launched formal investigations into eight of them. Sick notes that appeared to come from doctors at the protests were submitted by 84 teachers. The Madison School District denied a Wisconsin State Journal request to view the notes - with the teachers' names removed - under the state's open records law. The newspaper sued to have the notes released with a lawsuit now pending.

Two of the libel actions required nominal out-of-court settlements ($5,000 each) and twice he was fined: in one instance Bannerman was held in contempt for violating a ban of publication of evidence in a major underworld drug case; and, in another he was fined under the Broadcast Act for conducting an on-air political poll on an election day. However, he is ashamed of only one incident in the long broadcast career. This was an editorial in 1985 which intended to question Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's statement, [...] "I believe in native self-government," [...] discussing both self-government and self-sufficiency. In {{the course of the}} argument he pointed out the serious social problems on many of the country's reserves, suggesting that native leaders have to take more responsibility for both creating and dealing with these matters. None of this would have been out of line. Bannerman had consistently been on the side of responsible native leaders throughout both his newspaper and broadcasting career. The problem with this event is that the editorial - which escalated into what could only be described as a tirade - seemed to forget that Mulroney's ingenuous politics were the issue, and repeatedly cited a long list of problems on Indian reserves. The tone was venomous. Bannerman was quick to apologize, but the Nisga'a people of the BC north and the Musqueam Band (Coast Salish) filed a formal complaint with the national broadcasting regulator. The native bands were both eloquent and patient in their appeal. Others clamoured for punitive action against CKNW and Bannerman. Eventually, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunication Commission issued a <b>written</b> <b>reprimand</b> for a broadcast which might have had the consequence of engendering racism.
