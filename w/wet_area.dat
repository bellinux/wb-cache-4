This created a large <b>wet</b> <b>area</b> amid the dry San Joaquin Valley, and swamps abounded at its shores. By the 1970s, it was completely drained, but it attempts to resurrect itself during heavy rains.|$|E
25|$|The fire-tube boiler is characterised by {{internal}} tubes {{connected to the}} firebox that guide the smoke and hot combustion gases through the pressurised <b>wet</b> <b>area</b> of the boiler. These tubes greatly increase the contact area between the hot and the wet areas of the boiler, increasing {{the efficiency of the}} thermal conduction and thermal radiation processes of heat transfer between the two. The combustion gases emerge from the ends of the fire-tubes {{at the front of the}} boiler and are discharged via the smokebox to the chimney (stack or smokestack in the US).|$|E
500|$|The African crake {{is active}} during the day, {{especially}} at dusk, during light rain, or after heavier rain. It is less skulking {{and easier to}} flush from cover than other crakes, and is often seen {{at the edges of}} roads and tracks. An observer in a vehicle can approach to within [...] When a bird is flushed it normally flies less than , but new arrivals may occasionally fly twice as far. A flushed crake will frequently land in a <b>wet</b> <b>area</b> or behind a thicket, and crouch on landing. In short grass, it can escape from a dog using its speed and manoeuvrability, running with the body held almost horizontal. It may roost in a depression near grass tussock and it will bathe in puddles.|$|E

Aircraft <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> (Swet), the total exposed surface area, can be visualized as {{the area of the}} external parts of the aircraft that would get wet if it were dipped into water. The <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> must be calculated for drag estimation, as it is the major contributor to friction drag. The <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> is estimated by multiplying the true view exposed as plan form area (Sexposed) times a factor based upon the wing or tail thickness ratio. If a wing or tail were papperthin, the <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> would be exactly twice the true plan form area (i. e. top and bottom). The effect of finite thickness is to increase the <b>wetted</b> <b>area,</b> as approximated. Note that the true exposed plan form area is the projected (topview) area divided by the cosine of the dihedral angle...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{aerodynamic}} heating of a ballistic missile due to only convection is analysed {{taking into consideration}} the effects of gravity. The amount of heat transferred to the <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> and to the nose region has been separately determined, unlike A Miele's treatise without consideration of gravity. The peak heating rates to the <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> and to {{the nose of the}} missile are also investigated. Finally four numerical examples are cited to estimate the errors, in heat transfers and heating rates to both <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> and nose region of the missile, arising out of neglecting the gravitational forces...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTEfficiency of {{weed control}} can be {{increased}} if the herbicide formulation provides higher target coverage and evaporation time that enable an adequate distribution of herbicide on the target plant, allowing the absorption to continue even after the droplets evaporation. The aim {{of this research was}} to assess the influence of glyphosate formulations on the <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> and evaporation time of droplets on different targets. Tests were conducted with droplets sizing from 500 &# 956;m containing three formulations of glyphosate (isopropylamine salt, ammonium salt and potassium salt) deposited on three surfaces, two leaves (Bidens pilosa and Cenchrus echinatus) and glass slides. Sequential images analyses were used to quantify the evaporation time and the <b>wetted</b> <b>area.</b> An experimental system was utilized that was composed of a droplet generator, a stereo microscope with a camera to capture images, as well as an environmental chamber controlled for temperature and relative humidity. The kind of glyphosate formulations and target surfaces are crucial in the <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> and evaporation time. The isopropylamine salt decreased the <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> and evaporation time when compared with ammonium salt and potassium salt for all the surfaces deposited on. Bidens pilosa allows an increased <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> for all the glyphosate formulations when compared to Cenchrus echinatus and glass slides...|$|R
