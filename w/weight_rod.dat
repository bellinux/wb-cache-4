2500|$|A rod {{is usually}} also {{classified}} by the optimal weight of fishing line {{or in the}} case of fly rods, fly line the rod should handle. Fishing line weight is described in pounds of tensile force before the line parts. Line <b>weight</b> for a <b>rod</b> is expressed as a range that the rod is designed to support. Fly <b>rod</b> <b>weights</b> are typically expressed as a number from 1 to 12, written as [...] "N"wt (e.g. 6wt.) and each weight represents a standard weight in grains for the first 30 feet of the fly line established by the American Fishing Tackle Manufacturing Association. For example, the first 30' of a 6wt fly line should weigh between 152-168 grains, with the optimal weight being 160 grains. In casting and spinning rods, designations such as [...] "8-15 lb. line" [...] are typical.|$|R

50|$|The species pursued, {{under which}} conditions, will largely {{determine}} the <b>weight</b> of <b>rod</b> selected. Next, {{it is important}} to match the line to the <b>weight</b> of the <b>rod.</b> Using too heavy a line on too light on a rod, or vice versa, will dramatically affect casting performance. It may also permanently warp the rod blank. Generally speaking, you can safely go one line weight more or less (i.e. using an 8wt or 10wt line on a 9wt rod). There are also rods stamped with a range of weights. For example, a rod may be rated 7-8wt. This indicates the rod is designed for either a 7 or 8 weight fly line. There are also some rods rated for wider ranges (e.g. 8-9-10wt). The drawback to multi-rated rods is that compromises in flexibility or action are made in order to accommodate a wider range of line weights. For example, a rod rated for 8-9 weight line will be slightly stiffer than a straight 8wt but slightly softer than a straight 9wt rod. In general, the more expensive the rod, the more likely it'll be designated for a single line weight rather than a range.|$|R

5000|$|Weight - Fly line {{weight is}} an {{industry}} standard measure of the actual weight in grains of the first 30 ft or 9.1 meters of fly line. Fly rods are designed to cast fly lines of a specific weight. Fly line weights vary from 1 weight to 15 weight using standards established by the American Fishing Tackle Manufacturers Association. A 5 weight fly line is designed to match up with a 5 <b>weight</b> fly <b>rod.</b> These relationships are not absolute and anglers may prefer to over-line or under-line any given rod depending on their casting style and rod action.

5000|$|Although {{a variety}} of methods are used to fish for tarpons (bait, lure, and fly on spinning, conventional, or fly rod), the method that has {{garnered}} the most acclaim is flats-fishing with a fly rod. It is a sport akin to hunting, combining the best elements of hunting with fishing. A normal tarpon fly rod outfit uses 10-12 <b>weight</b> <b>rods</b> and reels, spooled with appropriate line and using a class leader tippet of 12 - 20 lb; truly light tackle fishing where the fish may weigh 10 times or more than the breaking strength of the leader. Typically, an angler stations himself on the bow of a shallow-water boat known as a 'flats skiff', and {{with the aid of a}} guide, searches for incoming tarpon on the flats (inshore shallow areas of the ocean, typically no more than 3 - 4 ft deep). When a school of tarpons are sighted, the guide positions the boat to intercept the fish. The angler usually has no more than six to 10 seconds to false cast out enough flyline and make an accurate cast to these fast-moving fish. Accuracy and speed are paramount, but the task is compounded by the inevitable excitement and nervousness of seeing a school of fish that may top 180 lb bearing down on the angler. Once the cast is made, the fly is retrieved and hopefully a tarpon inhales the fly. The hookset is difficult due to the hard mouth of the fish, which has been likened to the hardness of concrete, so many tarpons throw the hook on the first few jumps; many times an angler is asked, [...] "how many tarpons did you jump?" [...] rather than how many they caught. If the hook stays secure, then the fight is on. Tarpons have tremendous endurance and are one of the most exciting gamefish to fight - frequent spectacular jumps, long runs, and stubborn bulldogging are all part of the game. Although an experienced and skillful tarpon angler can usually land a tarpon in less than an hour, the average angler usually takes longer, from one to more than three hours.|$|R

40|$|With {{operating}} anvil hammers, {{there are}} rigid impacts of die tools, {{and as a}} result, almost instantaneous impact stops of the falling parts of hammer. Such operating conditions lead to the accelerated breakdowns of rods because of significant wave stresses arising in them. Common differential and integral methods to estimate wave stresses are widespread in engineering practice. However, to use them a researcher has to possess certain skills and special software. We consider the method for estimating the wave stresses in the rods of anvil hammers based on Laplace transforms (LT) of wave equation. The article shows a procedure {{to set up and}} solve differential wave equations by operator method. These equations describe the wave propagation process of strains and stresses in the rods of anvil hammers with rigid impact and taking into account a damping rod connection with the head of hammer. The method takes into consideration an influence of both piston and <b>rod</b> <b>weights</b> and of mechanical and geometrical characteristics of rod on the stress value in the placement of rod in hammer head. Results analysis shows that a sufficiently efficient method for practical improving the durability of rods is the method of damping impact load on the rod through setting the damping devices in the form either of elastic "pad" of one or another design or of hydraulic shock absorbers in the placement of its connection with the hammer head. In this case there is a change of the wave front, it becomes flatter. It is shown that the stresses in the rod are proportional to the amount of wave stresses because of the own impact of rod and piston, which make a total weight of the system. Effect of piston weight on the stresses value at the rod during impact is directly proportional to the ratio of its <b>weight</b> to the <b>rod</b> <b>weight.</b> The geometric parameters of rod and the speed of the falling parts before the impact also influence on the value of stresses in the rod. The represented method of the stresses analysis can be successfully applied to the selection of optimal weights and the geometric parameters of the piston and rod during rigid impact of falling parts without damping and taking into account the energy dissipation until the stiff stop of falling parts of the anvil hammer. </p...|$|R

50|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{itself is}} not aerodynamic; it is caused by general conservation of angular momentum acting on mass whose radial distribution is not symmetric about the axis of rotation. It can be visualized by imagining a uniform long rod, {{at each end of}} which is a perpendicular extension, each pointing opposite the other. (If the rod is horizontal, one points up and the other points down.) At the end of each extension is a weight. The extensions and weights are identical, so the center of mass and the axis of rotation {{along the length of the}} rod are unaffected by the <b>weights.</b> If the <b>rod</b> is then spun about its axis, the centrifugal forces on the two weights will cause the entire assembly to tilt relative to its initial axis of rotation.|$|R
50|$|Where {{the motion}} of the side-rods is purely circular, as on {{locomotives}} driven by jackshafts or geared transmission to one driver, counterweights can balance essentially all of {{the motion of}} the side rods. Where part of the motion is non-circular, for example, the horizontal motion of a piston rod, counterweights on the wheels or drive axles cannot be made to balance the entire assembly perfectly. On a driving wheel supporting both side-rods and the connecting rod to a piston, the counterweight needed to balance the horizontal motion of the piston and connecting rod would be heavier than the counterweight needed to balance the vertical <b>weight</b> of the <b>rods.</b> As a result, a counterweight chosen to minimize the total vibration will not minimize the vertical component of the vibration.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{rotary swaging}} process for {{producing}} solid bars, tubes or wires {{is often used}} to obtain the chipless forming process compared with the conventional process such as the machining and welding operation. Furthermore, machined chip, dust particles, harmful gas, and surface contamination to be commonly generated at hot working during the conventional process could be eliminated as the swaging process is applied and conducted at room temperature. Experiments for swaged product were performed to analyze the influence of the swaging process on the mechanical properties and dimensional precision in terms of surface roughness, surface hardness, and deviation of formed dimension. The changes of dimensional precision in swaged product are also checked out and considered for various process parameters such as the forming speed and the reduction in the outer diameter. Based on the experimental results, the surface roughness is improved under the swaging process. The <b>weight</b> of <b>rod</b> shift is reduced by about 15 % from 223. 5 g to 190. 2 g. Thus the number of operations to produce the final product under the conventional process is larger than that under the swaging process to be able to omit the machining and welding operation, etc. This paper demonstrates that a rotary swaging process turns out to be an environment-friendly forming process or chipless forming process without the machined chip...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} time-course and post-receptoral pathway {{signaling}} of photoreceptor interactions when the rod (R) and three cone (L, M, S) photoreceptor classes contribute to mesopic vision. A four-primary photostimulator independently controls photoreceptor activity in human observers. The first experiment defines the temporal adaptation response of receptoral (L-, S-cone, rod) and post-receptoral (LMS, LMSR,+L-M) signaling and interactions. Here {{we show that}} nonopponent cone-cone interactions (L-cone, LMS, LMSR) have monophasic temporal response patterns whereas opponent signals (+L-M, S-cone) show biphasic response patterns with slower recovery. By comparison, rod-cone interactions with nonopponent signals have faster adaptation responses and reduced sensitivity loss whereas opponent rod-cone interactions are small or absent. Additionally, the rod-rod interaction differs from these interaction types and acts to increase rod sensitivity due to temporal summation but with a slower time course. The second experiment shows that the temporal profile of the rod signal alters the relative rod contributions to the three primary post-receptoral pathways. We demonstrate that rod signals generate luminance (þLþM) signals mediated via the MC pathway with all rod temporal profiles and chromatic signals (L/LþM, S/LþM) in both the PC and KC pathways with durations. 75 ms. Thus, we propose that the change in relative <b>weighting</b> of <b>rod</b> signals within the post-receptoral pathways contributes to the sensitivity and temporal response of rod and cone pathway signaling and interactions...|$|R

One-weight (1wt) rods and lines are the lightest; the weight designations increase in whole number increments as the rod becomes heavier. The heaviest rods and lines readily available currently are 16-weight (16wt). In general, 1wt through 2wt rods {{would be used for}} the cast small flies for small trout and panfish; 3wt and 4wt rods are popular for small-stream fishing; 5wt is often considered the all-around rod for trout and general freshwater fishing; 6wt and 7wt rods are used on large rivers and for fishing with streamers, for larger warmwater species, and occasionally in calm inshore conditions for smaller saltwater species; 8wt to 9wt rods and lines might be used for steelhead or salmon in medium rivers, as well as for bass fishing with large flies, fishing for large carp, and general inshore saltwater use; and 10-11wt rods and lines would be used for pursuing large saltwater gamefish (tarpon, snook) under conditions of high wind or surf. The heaviest rods (12-16wt) are mostly used for bluewater species (billfish, tuna) while fishing from a boat. The characteristics of these rods reflect the fact that only short casts are needed during this type of fly fishing, while lifting ability is at a premium.|$|R
