25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Stephen Kay, {{who had worked}} for the {{prosecution}} in the trial, became alarmed that Manson Family member Leslie Van Houten had gathered 900 signatures on a petition for her parole. He contacted Tate's mother, Doris, who said she <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> could do better, and the two mounted a publicity campaign, collecting over 350,000 signatures supporting the denial of parole. Van Houten had been seen as the most likely of the killers to be paroled; following Kay's and Tate's efforts, her petition was denied. Doris Tate became a vocal advocate for victims' rights and, in discussing her daughter's murder and meeting other crime victims, assumed the role of counselor, using her profile to encourage public discussion and criticism of the corrections system.|$|E
500|$|For {{the scene}} in which the Doctor, Amy, and River are riding on horses, the close-ups of the {{characters}} riding were filmed by having the actors sit on a saddle mounted {{on the back of}} a truck and act like they were riding horses. Gillan called this the [...] "strangest thing" [...] she had ever done, and <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> [...] "looked ridiculous". They were filmed performing this as the truck drove to achieve the effect of the passing country. Wide shots were taken of stunt doubles of the three actors riding real horses. This scene was filmed on 1 February 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Taveras, {{one of the}} men accused, {{said that}} Ndonye was accidentally {{separated}} from her boyfriend at an on-campus party and began making out with his nephew, Felipe. Taveras told investigators Ndonye invited them to her dorm room. Taveras told her he had friends to which she replied [...] "Bring 'em along. It'll be hot". Felipe asked her if she <b>was</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>she</b> replied [...] "Yeah, sure, I want to".|$|E

2500|$|In April 2007, Kay was {{watching}} the sixth [...] hour of The Today Show (an apparent jab at NBC's decision to extend it {{at the expense of}} the Passions timeslot) when it was interrupted with a news report that Luis had been arrested. In one August 2007 episode, Tabitha said that a certain soap opera was starting on DirecTV and she would have to tell her friends not to call her between the hours of 2:00 and 3:00 pm, blatantly referring to Passions itself. At the beginning of the show's final week on NBC, as Whitney was preparing to move to New Orleans, Theresa asked if she <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> wanted to go, and Whitney commented that she had already arranged to have her DirecTV hooked up in Louisiana so she could [...] "keep up on everything happening in Harmony." [...] And also in 2007, Endora flat-out made a reference to the [...] "audience" [...] in one of her thought balloons, prompting Norma to look in the camera and respond, [...] "Audience? What audience?" [...] Endora also pointed out in one of her thought balloons that when Miguel returned to Passions, he looked nothing like Jesse Metcalfe ("Nope, not even close!"). In May 2008 while Juanita was looking for clues in a bookstore as to where Pilar was, the bargain shelf was full of copies of Hidden Passions. In [...] June 2008, Tabitha mentions the fourth hour of Today being a ratings-grabber, poking fun as to how they canceled the soap making way for this fourth hour trying to bring the ratings on NBC up.|$|E
2500|$|In her {{autobiography}} Cross Creek {{first published}} in 1942, Rawlings described how she owned many acres of land and also hired many people to help her with day-to-day chores and activities. An entire chapter {{of the book is}} dedicated to one woman she hired, whose name was Beatrice, but whom she was affectionately known as [...] "GeeChee", because the woman was ethnically part of the GeeChee people. In the book Rawlings said GeeChee's mother lived in nearby Hawthorne, Florida and GeeChee was blind in one eye from a fight she was involved in. GeeChee was employed by Rawlings on and off for nearly two years in which GeeChee dutifully made life easier for Rawlings. GeeChee revealed to Rawlings that her boyfriend named Leroy was serving time in prison for manslaughter, and asked Rawlings for help in gaining his release. She arranged for Leroy to be paroled to her and come work for her estate, and had a wedding on the grounds for Beatrice and Leroy. After a few weeks, Leroy aggressively demanded for more earnings from Rawlings and threatened her. She decided he had to leave, which caused her distress because she did not want GeeChee to go with him, and <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> would. GeeChee eventually decided to stay with Rawlings, but GeeChee began to drink heavily and abandoned her. Weeks later, Rawlings went out searching for GeeChee and drove her back to her estate, describing GeeChee as a [...] "Black Florence Nightingale". GeeChee was unable to stop herself from drinking, which led a heartbroken Rawlings to dismiss her. Rawlings stated in her autobiography [...] "No maid of perfection--and now I have one--can fill the strange emptiness she left in a remote corner of my heart. I think of her often, and I know she does of me, for she comes once a year to see me".|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes;--your sister. And I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> disapproves it. She {{did not say}} so; but I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> it <b>is</b> so. And {{then she}} told me something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With that astounding self-possession? I've always <b>been</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> {{wanted to}} go back alone. And now her brother has managed it for her." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{actually}} flushed, for {{the first}} time in my dealings with her betraying a feeling which I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> deemed most unprofessional.|$|R

60|$|CAMILLE. I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> will <b>be</b> veree {{grateful}} for the poor little beggars. Madame says {{she will not be}} coming to lunch, Monsieur.|$|R
60|$|LADY MARY (impulsively). George, I am {{so sorry}} if I said {{anything}} against your mother. I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> the dearest old thing.|$|R
6000|$|I hesitated, laughing. 'I retract--you are sane and clear. I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> {{thinks there}} won't be any harm,' I added. 'That's the great point.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, for her part," [...] she said, [...] "she hoped Cap'n Pennel {{would be}} blessed in takin' that ar boy; but she <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> didn't see much {{that looked like}} it now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did think}} so, {{but as they}} never said {{anything}} about it, and you came away, I supposed I was mistaken. And Jo wouldn't be kind to you? Why, I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> loved you dearly." ...|$|E

60|$|Once {{more the}} tears filled her soft, gentle {{eyes as she}} stole away, making not the least little sound. When she <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> was far enough away to hurry without {{attracting}} Peter's attention, she began to run.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want her}} to do it," [...] cried Grizel, {{and he could not}} draw another word from her. However he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> thought him a wonder, and when next they met he {{challenged}} her with it.|$|E
60|$|I saw Madame van Hunker led {{out by a}} solid, wooden-faced old Dutchman, {{who looked}} more like her father than her husband; and I told Annora that I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> had worn the pearls only because he {{compelled}} her.|$|E
