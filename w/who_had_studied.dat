5|$|Câmpineanu, who had {{proposed}} a reformist constitution {{to replace the}} Regulament entirely, was forced into exile, but remained an influence on a younger generation of activists, both Wallachian and Moldavian. The latter group, comprising many young boyars <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> in France, also took direct inspiration from reformist or revolutionary-minded societies such as the Carbonari (and even, through Teodor Diamant, from Utopian socialism). It was this faction who would first explicitly publicize the demands for national independence and Moldo-Wallachian unification, which it included in a wider agenda of political reforms and European solidarity. Societatea Studenților Români (the Society of Romanian Students) was founded in 1846, having the French poet Alphonse de Lamartine for its honorary president.|$|E

5|$|In 1792, the King of Coorg, Dodda Vira-Rajendra, {{managed to}} escape from captivity at Seringapatnam, and, {{with the aid of}} the British armies under Lord Cornwallis, was able to regain Coorg for himself through the treaty of 1792 between the English, their allies and Tipu. Anxious to repopulate a kingdom {{depopulated}} by Tipu, Dodda welcomed the fugitive Konkani Christians. As an inducement to remain permanently in his territory, he granted them several privileges, obtained a priest from Goa, and built a chapel for them. After the relaxation of policies from 1792 onwards, the Christians began to resettle in Canara. Many Mangalorean Catholic students, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> for the priesthood in Goa returned to Mangalore.|$|E
5|$|Deodato also hired Perry Pirkanen {{and another}} actor from the Actors Studio to play Jack Anders and Alan Yates, respectively. The latter dropped out {{shortly before the}} {{production}} team left for the Amazon, although he appears in the film as an ex-colleague of Yates. Casting director Bill Williams subsequently chose Carl Gabriel Yorke to replace him for the role. Yorke, a stage actor <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> under Uta Hagen and appeared in three national tours of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, was chosen {{in part because he}} was the right size for the costumes and boots, which had already been purchased. Because Cannibal Holocaust was a non-Union production, Yorke originally wanted to be credited under the alias Christopher Savage, but ultimately decided against doing so.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Hepburn {{gained a}} place at Bryn Mawr College. She {{attended}} the institution primarily to satisfy her mother, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> there, and recalled disliking the experience. It {{was the first time}} she had been in school for several years, and she was self-conscious and uncomfortable with her classmates. She struggled with the scholastic demands of university, and once was suspended for smoking in her room. Hepburn was drawn to acting, but roles in college plays were conditional on good grades. Once her marks had improved, she began performing regularly. She performed the lead role in a production of The Woman in the Moon in her senior year, and the positive response it received cemented Hepburn's plans to pursue a theatrical career. She graduated with a degree in history and philosophy in June 1928.|$|E

5|$|In his Essential Medical Treasures of the Golden Chamber (Jinkui yaolue), Zhang Zhongjing (c. 150– c. 219 CE) was {{the first}} to suggest a {{regulated}} diet rich in certain vitamins could prevent different types of disease, an idea which led Hu Sihui (fl. 1314–1330 CE) to prescribe a diet rich in Vitamin B1 as a treatment for beriberi. Zhang's major work was the Treatise on Cold Injury and Miscellaneous Disorders (Shanghan zabing lun). His contemporary and alleged associate Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was a physician <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> the Huangdi neijing and became knowledgeable in Chinese herbology. Hua Tuo used anesthesia on patients during surgery and created an ointment that was meant to fully heal surgery wounds within a month. In one diagnosis of an ill woman, he deciphered that she bore a dead fetus within her womb which he then removed, curing her of her ailments.|$|E
5|$|Scott, who {{because of}} his Discovery fame had entered Edwardian society, first met Kathleen Bruce early in 1907 at a private luncheon party. She was a sculptress, socialite and {{cosmopolitan}} <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> under Auguste Rodin and whose circle included Isadora Duncan, Pablo Picasso and Aleister Crowley. Her initial meeting with Scott was brief, but when they met again later that year, the mutual attraction was obvious. A stormy courtship followed; Scott was not her only suitor—his main rival was would-be novelist Gilbert Cannan—and his absences at sea did not assist his cause. However, Scott's persistence was rewarded and, on 2 September 1908, at the Chapel Royal, Hampton Court Palace, the wedding took place. Their only child, Peter Markham Scott, born 14 September 1909, was to found the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{arriving}} in the District of Columbia, Yamashita visited the Japanese Legation, and in March 1904, the Japanese naval attaché, Commander Takeshita Isamu, took Yamashita to the White House to meet President Theodore Roosevelt.

O'Brien, a Philadelphia police officer <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> jujutsu while living in Nagasaki. Roosevelt was impressed with Yamashita's skill, and during March and April 1904, Yamashita gave judo lessons to the President and interested family and staff in {{a room at the}} White House. Subsequently, at other locations, Yamashita and his wife Fude gave lessons to prominent American women, to include Martha Blow Wadsworth (sister of Kindergarten pioneer Susan Blow), Hallie Elkins (wife of Senator Stephen Benton Elkins), and Grace Davis Lee (Hallie Elkins' sister), and their children.|$|E

5|$|Weary of {{constantly}} being {{asked for her}} primary genre, Clarkson had long desired to record a Christmas album {{as a means to}} defy genre limitations. She commissioned Kurstin, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> jazz music under the tutelage of Jaki Byard, to produce the entire album. Drawing inspirations from the soundtracks to the features A Charlie Brown Christmas and White Christmas, as well as the Christmas albums by Mariah Carey, McEntire, and Phil Spector, they experimented on various styles and sounds using Spector's famed Wall of Sound technique to a create a contemporary holiday theme to classics. The Christmas music of Wrapped in Red comprises a variety of genres such as pop, jazz, country, and soul, marking a departure from the pop rock sound established from Clarkson's previous studio albums, while its lyrics share a singular theme of the color red, which represents a plethora of emotions during the holidays.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fifteenth}} century, {{beginning}} in northern Italy, universities had become {{strongly influenced by}} humanist thinking. This put an emphasis on classical authors, questioning some of the accepted certainties of established thinking and manifesting itself {{in the teaching of}} new subjects, particularly through the medium of the Greek language. However, in this period, Scottish universities largely had a Latin curriculum, designed for the clergy, civil and common lawyers. They did not teach the Greek that was fundamental to the new humanist scholarship, focusing on metaphysics and putting a largely unquestioning faith in the works of Aristotle, whose authority would be challenged in the Renaissance. Towards the end of the fifteenth century, a humanist influence was becoming more evident. A major figure was Archibald Whitelaw, a teacher at St. Andrews and Cologne who later became a tutor to the young James III and served as royal secretary from 1462 to 1493. By 1497, the humanist and historian Hector Boece, born in Dundee and <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> at Paris, returned to become the first principal at the new university of Aberdeen. In 1518 Mair returned to Scotland to become Principal of the University of Glasgow. He transferred to St. Andrews in 1523 and in 1533 he was made Provost of St Salvator's College. While in Scotland his students included John Knox and George Buchanan. These international contacts helped integrate Scotland into a wider European scholarly world and {{would be one of the}} most important ways in which the new ideas of Humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life in the sixteenth century.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of 895 the talented general Nikephoros Phokas the Elder was summoned to Constantinople and sent against the Bulgarians {{at the head of}} a large army. While Simeon concentrated his forces along the southern border to confront Phokas, the Byzantine navy under admiral Eustathios Argyros sailed to the Danube Delta to assist the Magyars. Believing that Simeon I would back off Leo VI sent an envoy, Constantinacios, to propose peace. Simeon I, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> in the University of Constantinople and was familiar with the Byzantine diplomacy, was suspicious of the Byzantine rapprochement, charged Constantinacios with espionage and put him into custody. The Danube was barred with an iron chain to impede the movement of the Byzantine navy and the bulk of the army was dislocated northwards. The Byzantines, however, managed to break the chain and transported the Magyar hordes south of the river. The Magyars, led by Árpád's son Liüntika, ravaged Dobrudzha and dealt a heavy defeat on the Bulgarian army, led personally by Simeon I. Simeon sought refuge in the strong fortress of Drastar while the Magyars pillaged and looted unopposed, reaching the outskirts of the capital Preslav. Before retreating north, the Magyars sold thousands of captives to the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|In {{this period}} Scottish {{universities}} largely had a Latin curriculum, {{designed for the}} clergy and civil and canon lawyers. They did not teach the Greek that was fundamental to the new Humanist scholarship, focusing on metaphysics, and putting a largely unquestioning faith {{in the works of}} Aristotle, whose authority would be challenged in the Renaissance. They provided only basic degrees. Those wanting to study for the more advanced degrees that were common amongst European scholars needed to go to universities in other countries. As a result, large numbers of Scots continued their studies on the Continent and at English universities. These international contacts helped integrate Scotland into a wider European scholarly world and {{would be one of the}} most important ways in which the new ideas of Humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life. By 1497 the Humanist and historian Hector Boece, born in Dundee and <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> at Paris, returned to become the first principal at the new university of Aberdeen.

5|$|Until {{the fifteenth}} century, those {{who wished to}} attend {{university}} had to travel to England or the continent, and just over a 1,000 {{have been identified as}} doing so between the twelfth century and 1410. Among these the most important intellectual figure was John Duns Scotus, who studied at Oxford, Cambridge and Paris and probably died at Cologne in 1308, becoming a major influence on late Medieval religious thought. After the outbreak of the Wars of Independence, with occasional exceptions under safe conduct, English universities were closed to Scots and continental universities became more significant. Some Scottish scholars became teachers in continental universities. At Paris this included John De Rate and Walter Wardlaw in the 1340s and 1350s, William de Tredbrum in the 1380s and Laurence de Lindores in the early 1500s. This situation was transformed by the founding of the University of St Andrews in 1413, the University of Glasgow in 1450 and the University of Aberdeen in 1495. Initially these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who would begin to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative post in the government and law. Those wanting to study for second degrees still needed to go elsewhere and Scottish scholars continued to visit the continent and English universities reopened to Scots in the late fifteenth century. The continued movement to other universities produced a school of Scottish nominalists at Paris in the early sixteenth century, of which John Mair was probably the most important figure. He had probably studied at a Scottish grammar school, then Cambridge, before moving to Paris, where he matriculated in 1493. By 1497 the humanist and historian Hector Boece, born in Dundee and <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>studied</b> at Paris, returned to become the first principal at the new university of Aberdeen.
