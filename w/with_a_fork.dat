2500|$|The phrase [...] "speaking <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>forked</b> tongue" [...] {{means to}} {{deliberately}} {{say one thing}} and mean another or, to be hypocritical, or act in a duplicitous manner. In the longstanding tradition of many Native American tribes, [...] "speaking <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>forked</b> tongue" [...] has meant lying, and a person was no longer considered worthy of trust, once he had been shown to [...] "speak <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>forked</b> tongue". This phrase was also adopted by Americans {{around the time of}} the Revolution, and may be found in abundant references from the early 19th century– often reporting on American officers who sought to convince the tribal leaders with whom they negotiated that they [...] "spoke <b>with</b> <b>a</b> straight and not <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>forked</b> tongue" [...] (as for example, President Andrew Jackson told the Creek Nation in 1829). According to one 1859 account, the native proverb that the [...] "white man spoke <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>forked</b> tongue" [...] originated as a result of the French tactic of the 1690s, in their war with the Iroquois, of inviting their enemies to attend a Peace Conference, only to be slaughtered or captured.|$|R

500|$|Konnan {{joined the}} New World Order (nWo) on July 14, 1997. Konnan {{developed}} an increasingly hip-hop based gimmick and was nicknamed [...] "K-Dogg." [...] During his first {{stint in the}} nWo, Konnan feuded with the Luchadores whom he had brought to WCW. During this storyline, he wrestled in a Mexican Death match at Road Wild against Rey Mysterio, Jr. and a match against Juventud Guerrera at Uncensored in March 1998. When the nWo divided into two rival factions on the May 4, 1998 episode of Nitro, Konnan sided with the nWo Wolfpac, led by Kevin Nash. The Wolfpac feuded with nWo Hollywood, led by Hollywood Hogan and became tweeners. On the November 30, 1998 episode of Nitro, Konnan defeated Chris Jericho for the World Television Championship. His reign lasted until December 28, 1998, when he lost to nWo Hollywood member Scott Steiner on Nitro following interference from Buff Bagwell. When {{the two halves of}} the nWo reunited in January 1999, Konnan was thrown out of the nWo for standing up for Rey Misterio, Jr and was attacked by Lex Luger. As a result, he became a face and teamed with Misterio to fight the nWo. After feuding with nWo member Lex Luger, Konnan and Mysterio, Jr. were defeated by The Outsiders at SuperBrawl IX, with The Outsiders removing Mysterio's mask in the process. Konnan later criticized WCW for not respecting Mexican wrestling culture by writing storylines that saw several Mexican wrestlers unceremoniously unmasked (Juventud Guerrera, Psicosis, and Mysterio). He compared asking a luchador to remove their mask to [...] "going to Japan and telling the Japanese they have to eat <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> instead of chopsticks." ...|$|E
500|$|Dubbed an [...] "iconoclast" [...] by Boxoffice, Belle {{continues}} to garner media recognition {{for her role}} in Beauty and the Beast. Established as a cultural icon, the character maintains the distinction of being Disney's first feminist princess. Commentators believe that the character's role in Beauty and the Beast as one of Disney's first strong female characters is responsible for changing the way in which women would be depicted in subsequent animated films. According to Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast, [...] "being a Disney princess meant singing songs about how much you love combing your hair <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> and giving away your voice if it meant you got to marry the guy with that dreamy chiseled jaw" [...] prior to Belle's arrival. The Los Angeles Times Charles Solomon ranked Belle among the four Disney Princesses responsible for breaking [...] "the bonds of convention." [...] About.com's David Nusair agreed that Belle successfully [...] "updated the princess formula for an entirely new generation." [...] The Atlantics Lindsay Lowe echoed Nusair's sentiment, citing Belle as the character responsible for ending Disney's [...] "history of ... docile heroines." [...] The Daily Campus Cathy Schmidt recognized Belle and Ariel as [...] "the beginnings of the more modern Disney princesses." [...] Writing for Virgin Media, Limara Salt believes that the character [...] "proved that audiences could {{fall in love with a}} brown-haired intellectual." [...] A survey conducted by Disney after the film's release determined that Belle's love of books inspired young women to read. Justin Humphreys of The Hook expressed, [...] "Belle remains a most successful princess because people can relate" [...] to her. Elina Bolokhova of Parenting believes that Belle's [...] "bravery and independence helped redefine the meaning of a Disney princess." [...] According to Justine McGrath of Teen Vogue, Belle has [...] "become one of the most popular classic Disney princesses of all time." [...] Commending her intelligence and lack of vanity, the character was placed at number one on E!'s ranking of the Disney Princesses, while Cosmopolitan ranked her fourth. In the magazine's [...] "Definitive Ranking Of Disney Princesses", Seventeen ranked Belle fifth. Similarly, BuzzFeed also ranked the character fifth, praising her love of reading. A reader poll conducted by BuzzFeed also determined that Belle is the most popular Disney Princess, having garnered 18% of votes. Belle is the fifth most successful Disney Princess in terms of box office revenue, with Beauty and the Beast having grossed over $350 million. However, Belle was the lowest-selling Disney Princess on eBay in 2013, with sales of less than $7,000 despite the fact that she is often cited as a customer favorite.|$|E

2500|$|Potato chips, {{also known}} as crisps in British English, are thin slices of potato that are deep fried or baked until crispy. Potato chips serve as an appetizer, side dish, or snack. The basic chips are cooked and salted, and {{additional}} varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including seasonings, herbs, spices, cheeses, and artificial additives. The original potato chip recipe was invented by chef George Crum at Moon's Lake House near Saratoga Springs, New York, on August 24, 1853. Fed up with a customer who continued to send his fried potatoes back complaining that they were too thick and soggy, Crum decided to slice the potatoes so thin {{that they could not}} be eaten <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fork.</b> As they could not be fried normally in a pan, he decided to stir-fry the potato slices.

[...] For example, the winning move in the position shown is the counterintuitive withdrawal of the queen from the seventh rank to a more central location, 1.

2500|$|At {{the same}} time that Chrétien's poll numbers started to improve in English Canada, he was {{attacked}} by several columnists in the Quebec media like Lise Bissonnette and Alain Dubuc in late 1991 as a simpleton who spoke Joual (a working class Montrealais dialect of Quebec French) with a strong working class accent instead of the Parisian French favored by Quebec elites who saw his use of joual as a sign that he was an [...] "Uncle Tom" [...] to English Canada. In a column in Le Devoir, Bissonnette called Chrétien a [...] "happy slave" [...] to the Anglos, a man whose inability to speak Parisian French and whose [...] "hard federalism" [...] proved he would always be submissive to English Canada. Pictures of Chrétien stirring the sugar in his coffee <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fork</b> angered many in Quebec who saw them as confirmation of their view of him as a backwoods bumpkin; a rustic and unsophisticated man who represented Quebec's past, not its future.

In December 1991, Chrétien wrote a column in The Toronto Star accusing his detractors like Bissonnette and Dubuc of [...] "snobbery" [...] and boosted that his working class origins and his use of working class joual instead of elitist Parisian French was something to be proud of.|$|E
