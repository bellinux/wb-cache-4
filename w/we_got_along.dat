Bassist Dee Dee Ramone wrote of Spector's obsessive techniques: [...] "Phil {{would sit in}} the control room and would listen through the headphones to Marky hit one note on the drum, hour after hour, after hour, after hour." [...] During the recording of [...] "Rock 'n' Roll High School", Johnny was forced by Spector to repeat his part hundreds of times {{over the course of several}} hours.

So that would sometimes irk everybody, and led to animosity with Johnny and Dee Dee." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Lubitsch was {{a tyrant}} on the set, the most {{demanding}} of directors. After one scene, which took from noon until five to get, I was almost in tears from listening to Lubitsch shout at me. The next day I sought him out, {{looked him in the}} eye, and said, 'Mr. Lubitsch, I'm willing to do my best but I just can't go on working on this picture if you're going to keep shouting at me.' 'I'm paid to shout at you', he bellowed. 'Yes', I said, 'and I'm paid to take it – [...] but not enough.' After a tense pause, Lubitsch broke out laughing.

[...] Valo further elaborated on the band's decision to call it quits later, stating: [...] "We got together and started playing some songs and thinking whats next [...] We felt like the new material wasn't taking flight. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>along</b> well together, but something was lacking.

[...] Valo didn't rule-out the possibility of the band reuniting in the future, stating: [...] "The good thing about this is that there's no drama [...] So it doesn't hurt the chances." ...|$|E

5000|$|When Kuehl {{was elected}} as a Democrat to the California Assembly in 1994 a Republican {{majority}} was seated {{for the first}} time in 20 years.

Kuehl recalled [...] "The Republican majority was quite a different kind of Republican, not a moderate, not a Rockefeller Republican. They were primarily Bible-thumpers and very right-wing. So it was not the most welcoming Republican group, though they loved Zelda Gilroy, and it was very difficult for them because they already liked me so much….
