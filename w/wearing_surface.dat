5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, {{two years before}} US13 had been {{completed}} as a four-lane divided highway from Dover to Wilmington, Delawareans petitioned DSHD to extend the divided highway south to the Maryland state line at Selbyville or Delmar (US13), a proposition DSHD acknowledged but deferred {{due to lack of}} funding, lack of proper planning, and higher priorities elsewhere in the state. Instead of adding divided highway in southern Delaware, DSHD needed to resolve the problem of the deterioration of 15- to 25-year-old concrete roads, such as those along the DuPont Highway. The department planned to address the issue by patching the concrete surface as needed, adding concrete shoulders, and applying a layer of bituminous concrete, more commonly known as asphalt concrete or blacktop, over the entire width of concrete to provide a <b>wearing</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{beginning}} of U.S. involvement in World War II, the U.S. Navy made plans to construct a naval air station on the Cedar Point peninsula near Jarboesville. [...] MD235 was marked for an upgrade from MD5 to Jarboesville both to connect the new military installation with Washington and to allow the road to handle the heavy military traffic that would travel the highway during the military base's construction and operations. [...] The highway was under construction {{by the end of}} 1942. [...] The highway's gravel surface was widened as a first layer and surface treated in autumn 1943 to help heavy traffic during the winter. [...] In spring 1944 the first layer was scarified and the top [...] were mixed with asphalt to form a base. [...] This base was covered with a [...] <b>wearing</b> <b>surface</b> of bituminous concrete. [...] MD235 was also reconstructed in this manner from Jarboesville to Hermanville in 1944 and 1945; included in that project was the construction of MD712 to provide a modern highway to the naval air station's South Gate. [...] During the reconstruction of MD235, the highway was relocated in many places between Mechanicsville and Hollywood to remove substandard curves and avoid grade crossings with the southern extension of the Washington, Brandywine and Point Lookout Railroad that the U.S. Navy constructed contemporaneously to provide a rail link to the military base. [...] Many of the bypassed stretches of highway—which included Harpers Corner Road in Oraville, Mount Zion Church Road in Laurel Grove, Oakville Road in Oakville, Clover Hill Road in Hillville, Old Three Notch Road in Hollywood, and the southernmost portion of Mervell Dean Road—were designated as sections of MD722.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} work, surface-coated Cu {{nanoparticles}} with FCC structure {{and an average}} size of 40 nm were prepared by reducing reaction and surface modification technique. The morphology and phase structure of the nano-copper were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM). The ball-on-disc tester and ring-on-block tester were performed to study the tribological properties of surface-coated Cu nanoparticles as oil additive. The tests were carried out under the lubrication of 50 CC oil alone and oil containing surface-coated nano-copper additives. The morphologies and elementary distributions of the <b>worn</b> <b>surfaces</b> were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), respectively. Results indicate that surface-coated nano-copper additives can significantly improve the wear resistance and load-carrying abilities of 50 CC oil, as well as reduce friction coefficient. A soft copper protective film is formed on the <b>worn</b> <b>surface</b> lubricated with oil containing nano-copper additives, which separates the <b>worn</b> <b>surfaces,</b> avoids their direct contact and reduces friction and adhesive wear. Besides, the grooves and small valleys on the <b>worn</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{are found to be}} partly filled and repaired by nano-copper, as makes the <b>worn</b> <b>surface</b> repaired and smoother. ...|$|R

2500|$|Asphalt {{overlays}} {{are sometimes}} laid over distressed concrete {{to restore a}} smooth <b>wearing</b> <b>surface.</b> A disadvantage of this method is that movement in the joints between the underlying concrete slabs, whether from thermal expansion and contraction, or from deflection of the concrete slabs from truck axle loads, usually causes [...] reflective cracks in the asphalt. To decrease reflective cracking, concrete pavement is broken apart through a break and seat, crack and seat, or rubblization process. Geosynthetics {{can be used for}} reflective crack control. With break and seat and crack and seat processes, a heavy weight is dropped on the concrete to induce cracking, then a heavy roller is used to seat the resultant pieces into the subbase. The main difference between the two processes is the equipment used to break the concrete pavement {{and the size of the}} resulting pieces. The theory is frequent small cracks will spread thermal stress over a wider area than infrequent large joints, reducing the stress on the overlying asphalt pavement. Rubblization is a more complete fracturing of the old, worn-out concrete, effectively converting the old pavement into an aggregate base for a new asphalt road.|$|E

The stable dispersions of 0. 5 wt%, 1 wt% and 2 wt% zinc borate ultrafine powder in sunflower oil were achieved by using an ultrasonic homogeniser. Both a 4 -ball tester and a pin-on-disc tester were employed to evaluate the anti-wear and friction reduction capabilities of zinc borate ultrafine powder. Tribo-films with dark colour were generated on the <b>worn</b> <b>surfaces</b> and showed a good contrast with the substrate. The <b>worn</b> <b>surface</b> with different morphologies reflected as the colour alterations on the <b>worn</b> <b>surface</b> were observed when different lubricants were applied. The morphology and elemental analysis of the <b>worn</b> <b>surfaces</b> were studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Mechanical properties of the tribo-films and substrates were studied with a nano-indentation tester. Test results suggest that tribo-films generated on the <b>worn</b> <b>surface</b> have a relatively low hardness compared with the steel substrate. The substrates on the <b>worn</b> <b>surfaces</b> lubricated in sunflower oil with the powder demonstrated higher hardness {{than that of the}} substrate lubricated with pure sunflower oil due to the possible tribo-chemical reaction between the zinc borate additive and substrate. The combination of sunflower oil with 0. 5 % zinc borate ultrafine powder has delivered the most balanced performance in friction and wear reduction.

40|$|Abstract. Two {{kinds of}} ceramic {{additives}} {{have been developed}} that one is the serpentine particles and another {{is a blend of}} serpentine particles and catalyst. The tribological properties of the addition of different additives are investigated through a series of friction and <b>wear</b> experiments. <b>Wear</b> <b>surface</b> and the composition of the tribofilm were examined by SEM, EDS and XPS. In case of single serpentine additive, tribo-film can be formed gradually on the <b>worn</b> metal <b>surface.</b> The friction coefficient is about 0. 11. The tribofilm mainly consists of Mg and Si elements transferred from the additive. This can compensates part of wear mass loss, avoids the direct contact of the two rubbing surfaces, and thus effectively improves the anti-wear characteristics. In case of the blend oil additive, the tribo-film formed obviously on the <b>worn</b> <b>surface</b> in the initial stage and no obvious film at end of the test. However, the friction coefficient can lower even to 0. 007 ~ 0. 008 compared with the above experiment. The <b>worn</b> <b>surface</b> becomes very smooth.

40|$|In this paper, a {{technique}} for the quantitative characterization of <b>wear</b> scar <b>surfaces,</b> using combined three-dimensional topographical analysis and contact resistance measurements, is introduced. Parameters for {{the characterization of}} <b>wear</b> <b>surfaces,</b> developed during sliding of pin-on-disk specimens in oxygen at high temperature, such as wear volume, roughness, average wear depth on the disk specimen, surface coverage by wear-protective oxide layers and their distributions over the <b>wear</b> <b>surface,</b> are presented and calculated. Such analyses provide more effective data {{for the analysis of}} wear processes and wear mechanisms. This method has been applied to the analysis of dry reciprocating sliding wear of a nickel-base alloy, N 80 A, at temperatures to 600 degrees C. It was found that there was usually a difference between the wear rates of the pin and the disk. This difference increased with increase in temperature, the wear of the pin being much less than that of the disk at the higher temperatures. Although the total wear of both the pin and the disk decreased considerably with increase in temperature, the damage to the disk, judged by the wear depth of the scar, was much higher at elevated temperatures than at low temperatures. The roughnesses of the <b>wear</b> <b>surfaces</b> generally increased with increase in temperature. Less than 50 % coverage of the scar surfaces by wear-protective oxide layers was sufficient for the severe-to-mild wear transition. However, the distribution of the wear-protective layers over the <b>wear</b> <b>surfaces</b> was non-uniform. Most of them were concentrated near the centre of the scar, along the sliding direction, under the present conditions. These features of the <b>wear</b> scar <b>surfaces</b> were mainly related to the adhesion and compaction of wear debris particles onto the <b>wear</b> <b>surfaces,</b> leading to development of the wear-protective layers at the various temperatures...|$|R

Thus, in this study, {{the extent of}} plastic deformation and strain localization events that occur at various depths beneath the <b>worn</b> <b>surface</b> in the subsurface zones of Cu pins slid against steel plate with various surface textures have been determined using simple metallographic techniques. Results showed that the magnitude of plastic strain gradient {{and the depth of}} highly deformed zone depend on both coefficient of friction and transfer layer formation, which in-turn depends on the surface texture of harder counterface, under both dry and lubricated conditions. In addition, it was seen that the gradient of equivalent strain, as it approached the <b>worn</b> <b>surface,</b> was higher under dry conditions when compared to that under lubricated conditions...|$|R
