50|$|Due {{to extreme}} odors and overfilling, a high {{percentage}} of privy vaults were cleaned out, to varying levels, while still in use. This is commonly referred to as “dipping” among privy diggers. The amount of dipping that occurred, how far down a <b>well</b> <b>material</b> was cleared and how frequently it was cleared, varied from privy to privy. After plumbing was installed at the residence there was a final cleaning, which had a tendency of removing everything down to the deepest level of the vault.|$|E
50|$|MQW devices must be {{operated}} at high reverse bias fields to achieve good contrast ratios. In perfect quantum <b>well</b> <b>material</b> {{this is not}} a problem, but the presence of a defect in the semiconductor crystal can cause the device to break down at voltages below those necessary for operation. Specifically, a defect will cause an electrical short that prevents development of the necessary electrical field across the intrinsic region of the PIN diode. The larger the device the higher the probability of such a defect. Thus, If a defect occurs in the manufacture of a large monolithic device, the whole shutter is lost.|$|E

50|$|The {{patterns}} of syncope {{are not new}} in Ottawa, and are attested in the Ottawa material that linguist Leonard Bloomfield recorded in the late 1930s from Andrew Medler, an Ottawa speaker originally from Michigan who {{spent most of his}} life at Walpole Island. Although reduction and syncope effects in Walpole Island Ottawa were noted in , and treated by him as vowel reduction, the situation was not identical in all Ottawa materials collected in approximately the same period. Material collected by Bloomfield in 1941 from Ottawa speaker Angeline Williams, then residing at Sugar Island, Michigan, east of Sault Ste. Marie show no sign of Syncope. Williams was born at Manistique, Michigan in 1872. As <b>well,</b> <b>material</b> collected by C. F.

40|$|The excitonic {{transition}} in Il-VI quantum <b>well</b> <b>materials</b> {{has recently been}} {{used as the basis}} for optical modulators and also as the lasing transition at low temperatures. The central aspect {{in the use of the}} exciton resonance in optical devices is the understanding of the exciton linewidth. We present a detailed study of the interactions that affect the linewidth in Il-VI semiconductor quantum <b>well</b> <b>materials.</b> The broadening of the resonance with increasing temperature can be controlled by altering the material parameters of the Il-VI structures. In so doing the exciton binding energy can exceed the LO-phonon energy and thereby reduce the homogeneous contribution to the measured linewidth. Efforts to reduce well-width fluctuations in the growth of the Il-VI quantum well structures, which are responsible for the inhomogeneous linewidth, must also be made to a limit where the room temperature Iinewidth is narrow and homogeneously broadened...|$|R

5000|$|Borland, Freese, and Lohner started another band, Black Light Burns, in 2005, upon Borland {{temporarily}} leaving Limp Bizkit. It {{is often}} {{considered to be}} a spiritual successor to The Damning Well and contains bits and pieces of their work. The track [...] "Power" [...] was reworked into the track [...] "Coward", and used in Black Light Burns as the fourth track of their debut album, Cruel Melody, without vocals from Patrick or Lee. Patrick claims to have a version with his and Lee's original vocals, but has not ever released said material. Additionally, some work is thought to have been carried on into Filter's 2008 release Anthems for the Damned, especially the song [...] "In Dreams", which was written and composed by Patrick and Borland, and features drums by Freese.

There were only two songs recorded under the Damning Well, it wasn’t a whole record. But I have the Amy Lee song I did with her, she just came in and sang my lyrics and sang with me, it was cool sounding though, I was really proud of it. It’s now on the Black Light Burns record. So yeah, we did one song for the Underworld soundtrack and it just kind of peted out after that. I wrote another song for something else and that was really about it."In 2010, Patrick said that while he hadn't talked to the members in years, he'd still consider doing an album with The Damning Well. However, by 2013, he stated [...] "that project is done for sure".|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that quantum well solar cells (QWSCs) can enhance short circuit current and power {{conversion}} efficiency in comparison with similar, conventional solar cells made from the quantum well (QW) barrier material alone. In this article we report measurements of the dark-current and open-circuit voltage (V-oc) {{of a number of}} quantum well cells in three different lattice-matched material systems, namely, Ala(0. 35) Ga(0. 65) As/GaAs, GaInP/GaAs, and InP/InGaAs. We also present the results obtained from comparable control cells without wells formed either from the material of the barriers or the <b>well</b> <b>material</b> alone. Our results clearly demonstrate in all three cases that, al fixed voltage, QWSC dark currents are systematically lower than would be expected from control cells with the same effective absorption edge. Measurements of V-oc in a white-light source show that the open-circuit voltages of the QWSCs are higher than those of control cells formed from the <b>well</b> <b>material.</b> Furthermore, this enhancement is more than is expected from the shift in the absorption edge due to the effect of confinement in the wells. We discuss these results in the light of recent theoretical speculation about the upper limit to the efficiency of an ideal quantum well solar cell.
