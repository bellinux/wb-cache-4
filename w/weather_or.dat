5|$|Operation Stack is {{a traffic}} {{management}} {{system on the}} M20 through and near Ashford, which allows HGVs to queue for the Channel Tunnel and the Port of Dover when there is bad <b>weather</b> <b>or</b> industrial action. The scheme is controversial as it involves closing the entire eastbound motorway to through traffic. In 2013, Kent County Council sought funding to build a dedicated lorry park in Ashford.|$|E
5|$|Originally the {{operation}} was due to begin on January 1, but poor ice conditions on the Neva caused the offensive to be delayed until January 10–12. A number of measures were taken to prevent the details of {{the operation}} being revealed to the Germans. Only a limited number of senior officers were involved in the planning, all redeployments took place in bad <b>weather</b> <b>or</b> at night and simulated attack preparations were made elsewhere to confuse the German side.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 20 teams {{competed in the}} Premier League in the 2004–05 season. Each team played 38 matches; two against every other team and one match at each club's stadium. Three points were awarded for each win, one point per draw, and none for defeats. At {{the end of the}} season the top two teams {{qualified}} for the group stages of the UEFA Champions League; teams in third and fourth needed to play a qualifier.

5|$|Due {{to local}} {{conditions}} it was sometimes {{necessary for the}} Commission to deviate from its standard design. In places prone to extreme <b>weather</b> <b>or</b> earthquakes, such as Thailand and Turkey, stone-faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones. These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground. In Italy, headstones were carved from Chiampo Perla limestone {{because it was in}} more plentiful supply. In Struma Military Cemetery, in Greece, to avoid risk of earthquake damage, small headstones are laid flush to the ground. Due to their smaller size, the markers often lack unit insignia.|$|E

5|$|Molten salt can be {{employed}} as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, {{so that it can}} be used to generate electricity in bad <b>weather</b> <b>or</b> at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar {{made possible by the}} cavity magnetron. In working on the Microwave Early Warning system (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear dipole array antenna that not only suppressed the unwanted side lobes of the radiation field, but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision bombing in bad <b>weather</b> <b>or</b> through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make much difference.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{generally}} resident across its range, but sightings of solitary and silent birds {{have suggested that}} the species may be migratory in Bolivia and Brazil. A study published in 2005 suggested it was migratory in Santa Fe, Argentina, as the species was not observed in the area between March and September (the austral winter). In 2006 the species was reported {{for the first time in}} Peru, but it was unclear if this represented a vagrant escaping cold <b>weather</b> <b>or</b> a migrant, as the species is mostly uncommon across its range and that area is poorly studied ornithologically.|$|E

40|$|In this activity, {{students}} learn about chemical and mechanical weathering in rocks. From the background material, they will learn that the change {{that takes place in}} rocks is called weathering and that this term refers to the destructive processes that change the character of rock at or near the Earth's surface. Processes of mechanical <b>weathering</b> (<b>or</b> physical disintegration) break rock into smaller pieces but do not change its chemical composition; processes of chemical <b>weathering</b> (<b>or</b> rock decomposition) transform rocks and minerals exposed to water and atmospheric gases into new chemical compounds (different rocks and minerals), some of which can be dissolved away. Four experiments that illustrate the effects of mechanical and chemical weathering are provided. Educational levels: Intermediate elementary, Middle school, High school...|$|R

5|$|William mustered {{his forces}} at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme, {{and was ready}} to cross the English Channel by about 12 August. But the {{crossing}} was delayed, either because of unfavourable <b>weather</b> <b>or</b> to avoid being intercepted by the powerful English fleet. The Normans crossed to England a few days after Harold's victory over the Norwegians, following the dispersal of Harold's naval force, and landed at Pevensey in Sussex on 28 September. A few ships were blown off course and landed at Romney, where the Normans fought the local fyrd. After landing, William's forces built a wooden castle at Hastings, from which they raided the surrounding area. More fortifications were erected at Pevensey.|$|E
5|$|Dover's Hill {{was bought}} by the National Trust in 1928, and until {{recently}} contained a monument to Robert Dover. The Games were revived for the 1951 Festival of Britain, but {{did not return to}} being a regular event until the Robert Dover's Games Society was founded in 1965. Except when exceptionally bad <b>weather</b> <b>or</b> an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease has forced their cancellation the Games have been held each year since 1966, on the evening of the Friday after Spring Bank Holiday, and attract thousands of visitors. An actor dressed as Dover arrives on horseback to open the games. Events have included the tug of war, gymkhana, shin-kicking, dwile flonking, motorcycle scrambling, judo, piano smashing, morris dancing, and, in 1976, poetry. After dusk a bonfire is lit, followed by a torchlight procession to the square in Chipping Campden, where the entertainment continues well into the night.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia {{established}} the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) {{to investigate the}} incident, working with foreign aviation authorities and experts. Malaysia has stated that a final report on Flight 370 will be released {{by the end of}} 2017. Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad <b>weather,</b> <b>or</b> technical problems before the aircraft vanished. Two passengers travelling on stolen passports were investigated, but eliminated as suspects. Malaysian police have identified the captain as the prime suspect if human intervention was the cause of the disappearance, after clearing all others on the flight of suspicious motives. Power was lost to the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) at some point between 01:07 and 02:03; the SDU logged onto Inmarsat's satellite communication network at 02:25—three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar. Based on analysis of the satellite communications, the aircraft turned south after passing north of Sumatra and the flight continued for six hours with little deviation in its track, ending when its fuel was exhausted.|$|E
