5|$|The Senate, now {{alarmed at}} the {{apparently}} unstoppable rebellion occurring within Italy, gave {{the task of}} putting down the rebellion to Marcus Licinius Crassus. Crassus <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> Roman politics, or to military command {{as he had been}} a field commander under Lucius Cornelius Sulla during the second civil war between Sulla and the Marian faction in 82 BC, and had served under Sulla during the dictatorship that followed.|$|E
5|$|Jolin, {{as well as}} Dardel, used a naïve {{style in}} their {{paintings}} before this concept had been introduced into the Swedish art world. Both Jolin and Dardel were inspired by French naïvists, not just by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, but also by Séraphine Louis who lived in Sentis and Wilhelm Uhde, a specialist in naïve painting. Matisse, Jolin's and Dardel's mentor, <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> naïve art {{but it was not}} prominent in his work. Jolin also appreciated the cultivated and sophisticated, older painting, and was deeply impressed during his visits to the Louvre, where he was inspired by the works of masters such as Rubens, Watteau and Chardin.|$|E
5|$|Near the Canadian {{side of the}} {{restored}} trenches is a small memorial plaque dedicated to Lieutenant-Colonel Mike Watkins MBE. Watkins was head of Explosive Ordnance Disposal at the Directorate of Land Service Ammunition, Royal Logistic Corps, and a leading British explosive ordnance disposal expert. In August 1998, he died in a roof collapse near a tunnel entrance while undertaking a detailed investigative survey of the British tunnel system {{on the grounds of}} the Canadian National Vimy Memorial site. Watkins <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> the tunnel system at Vimy Ridge. Earlier the same year, he participated in the successful disarming of 3 tonnes of deteriorated ammonal explosives located under a road intersection on the site.|$|E

5|$|Chris Boucher {{began his}} {{television}} writing career in comedy, working on such programmes as Dave Allen at Large and Romany Jones, {{before moving on}} to write for drama series, including Shoestring, Juliet Bravo and Bergerac. He <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> television science fiction, having written three serials for Doctor Who and having acted as script editor on the entire four season run of Blake's 7 as well as writing nine episodes for it himself. Boucher originally pitched Star Cops to the BBC in 1981 as a radio series but, with James Follet's epic Earthsearch serial in production that year, it was felt that science fiction was adequately served in the schedules and so Boucher tried to sell it to television instead. He sent the draft script of the first Star Cops story to Jonathan Powell, the Head of Drama at BBC television. Powell responded asking Boucher to write a second script and on the strength of this the series was commissioned. However, Powell insisted that the first story, which Boucher had intended to run over two episodes, be reworked into a single episode. This would be the first of many difficulties Boucher would have with how Star Cops was eventually realised for the screen. Boucher, who at this time was working as script editor on the crime series Bergerac, was also told by Powell he could work on Star Cops or on Bergerac but not on both and so chose to leave Bergerac.|$|E

The storyline helped millions of women realize the importance of regular checkups and pap smear screenings. Bauer received a record amount of mail from fans.|$|E

25|$|Bourne sent {{many men}} to both world wars, but was {{otherwise}} only lightly affected. During the Second World War a German bomber {{was shot down}} and crashed onto the Butcher's Arms public house in Eastgate. Nine people were killed, including the bomber's crew. In a separate incident, a number of bombs were dropped on the Hereward Camp approved school, a row of wooden huts adjacent to the woods {{that may have been}} mistaken for a military camp. Charles Richard Sharpe was injured in the second incident, but he <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> fighting the Germans, having been awarded the Victoria Cross in the first conflict of the century.|$|E
25|$|Hajibeyov <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> {{the tragic}} chaos of war; he {{lived through the}} Revolutions of 1905 and 1917, {{the fall of the}} Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan in 1920, and both World Wars. The {{political}} repercussions of these military conquests often manifested in other forms of chaos. For example, between 1920 and 1940, the alphabet systems for writing Azeri were changed three times — from Arabic to Latin, and from Latin to Cyrillic — a process which greatly hindered and interrupted the educational and cultural process and may well {{have been one of the}} factors influencing Uzeyir Hajibeyov to present his ideas verbally on the musical stage.|$|E

Upon its return to America it first performed in New York City at Aeolian Hall on January 7, 1914, when, demonstrating a recurrent predilection for adventurously mixing music old and new, the program featured Glazounov’s Suite in C Major, op. 35; Haydn’s Quartet in G Major, op. 76 no. 1; and the Romantische Serenade of Jan Brandts Buys, {{which had been}} heard in New York on only one prior occasion. The quartet's sixth transcontinental tour of the United States and Canada, announced in late 1917, included two performances in New York City and others in Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Boston, and Chicago.|$|E

25|$|Throughout his life, Paganini <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> chronic illnesses. Although no {{definite}} medical proof exists, he was {{reputed to}} {{have been affected by}} Marfan syndrome or Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. In addition, his frequent concert schedule, as well as his extravagant lifestyle, took their toll on his health. He was diagnosed with syphilis as early as 1822, and his remedy, which included mercury and opium, came with serious physical and psychological side effects. In 1834, while still in Paris, he was treated for tuberculosis. Though his recovery was reasonably quick, after the illness his career was marred by frequent cancellations due to various health problems, from the common cold to depression, which lasted from days to months.|$|E
25|$|The {{founder of}} the {{aviation}} program at UND, John D. Odegard, logged over 10,000 hours of flight {{time in his life}} and was licensed for commercial flight and instrument operations. He was type-rated in Cessna Citations, Learjet, and Beechjet, as well as being a certificated flight instructor (CFI) and certified examiner for commercial, instrument, tailwheel, multiengine, and Citation type-ratings. Having broken the sound barrier in the Concorde (as a passenger) and having flown as a crop-duster to help pay for college, Odegard <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> the varied envelopes of flight. He was quite familiar with the many aspects of aviation and his vision for a well-rounded school which trains pilots in all aspects of flight helped the aviation program at UND become what it is today. Odegard died of cancer in 1998 at the age of 57. He is buried in Grand Forks, less than a mile away from the UND campus.|$|E
25|$|Reeves' {{agent was}} {{amenable}} to the project, but Phoenix's agent {{would not even}} show the screenplay to the young actor. Not to be deterred, Van Sant {{got the idea for}} Reeves to personally deliver the film's treatment to Phoenix at his home in Florida. Reeves did so over the Christmas holidays, riding his 1974 Norton Commando motorcycle from his family home in Canada to the Phoenix family ranch in Micanopy, Florida, outside Gainesville. Reeves <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> River Phoenix or members of his family, having worked previously with River on Lawrence Kasdan's I Love You to Death and with his brother Joaquin and girlfriend Martha Plimpton on Ron Howard's Parenthood. After reading the treatment, Phoenix agreed {{to play the role of}} Scott. However, since Van Sant had already cast Reeves in the role, they had to convince River to take on the edgier role of drug-addicted hustler Mike Waters. The director promised not to make either actor do anything embarrassing.|$|E

25|$|While Ferrari {{celebrated their}} dominance, the sport itself {{was seen by}} many to be in trouble. Two more privateers, Prost and Arrows, had closed their doors for good. Benetton was also no more, the team having been {{completely}} bought out by Renault and turned into their factory team. Even more troubling was the one team in seemingly no danger of disappearing: Ferrari. While Formula One <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>stranger</b> <b>to</b> teams monopolizing the winner's stand, Ferrari's actions throughout the 2002 season annoyed many; in particular the staged finishes of the Austrian Grand Prix and the US Grand Prix. It seemed to many {{that it was possible to}} take the dictum of 'win at all costs' too far. Ratings and attendance noticeably declined in the later half of 2002, a serious problem for a sport which was by far the most expensive (and, more importantly, most lucrative) in the world by this time. Also, a number of major manufacturers had joined Formula One since 2000 - there were now 8 manufacturers participating in some form in Formula One. Toyota, Ford/Jaguar and Renault had joined as full works teams, and Mercedes, Honda, BMW and Cosworth were all supplying engines to specific teams.|$|E
