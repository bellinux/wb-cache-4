25|$|The entire {{figure is}} then coated with clay made from termite hills until the mould is of a {{necessary}} thickness. Then the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> dried and fired in an oven with cow-dung cakes. The wax model melts and flows out, {{while some of}} it vapourises.|$|E
25|$|Oh, I'm now {{fully aware}} of the mark Led Zeppelin made on the musical landscape. My {{awareness}} was re-heightened when we were remastering the material to do that CD box set in 1990. When you hear it all, song after song, you realise what a textbook it is for musicians who are coming along, and that's so great. The <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> about passing it on, because that's how it was done for me when I was learning from all those old blues and rockabilly records. It's all part of how this cultural phenomenon keeps moving on. I think everyone carries the flame on.|$|E

25|$|The Hood, which {{cannot be}} thrown or run with, is moved slowly by 'swaying', that is pushing and pulling the Hood and {{people within the}} 'Sway' toward the {{direction}} of their pub. Although everyone is trying to push in a particular direction, there are no real organised teams. The Sway makes very slow progress, as it snakes around, stopping quite often when it collapses, in order to pull bodies out, that became crushed into the mud. Safety is of prime concern and the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> supervised by the Boggins. The Lord is referee and sees that {{the game is played}} fairly. At any one time there are usually around 200 people in the Sway and about one thousand people watching. Games can last anything from a couple of hours onwards and have been known to go on well into the night. Everything {{in the path of the}} Sway goes down before it, including hedges and walls. Another of the Boggins' jobs is to stop the Sway destroying everything in its path.|$|E
500|$|Controversy {{surrounded}} Branham {{from the}} early stages of his ministry. In 1947, a minister in Saskatchewan, Canada, stated that many Branham pronounced as healed later died. A year later, W. J. Taylor, a district superintendent with the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, raised the same concern and asked for a thorough investigation, presenting evidence that claims of the number of people healed were vastly overestimated. He stated that [...] "there is a possibility that this <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> wrong".|$|E
500|$|Hutcherson {{currently}} {{lives in}} Los Angeles, California. In May 2012, he purchased the [...] $2.5 million former house of Heath Ledger in Laurel Canyon in the Hollywood Hills, a small ranch built in 1951. He professes that his fame {{has not changed}} him as a person, stating, [...] "I love my job {{more than anything in}} the world and I could never imagine doing anything else. So this <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> a very small price to pay compared to someone who has to go to an office to work." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{backlash}} against grunge {{began to develop}} in Seattle; in late 1992 Jonathan Poneman {{said that in the}} city, [...] "All things grunge are treated with the utmost cynicism and amusement [...] Because the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> a fabricated movement and always has been." [...] Many grunge artists were uncomfortable with their success and the resulting attention it brought. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain told Michael Azerrad, [...] "Famous is the last thing I wanted to be." [...] Pearl Jam also felt the burden of success, with much of the attention falling on frontman Eddie Vedder.|$|E
500|$|Although Van der Byl was now {{prepared}} {{to say that he}} supported the transition to majority rule, he was quick to put restrictions on it when interviewed in April 1977. He insisted that majority rule would only be possible on a [...] "very qualified franchise—that's what the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> about", and also said that any settlement must be endorsed by a two-thirds majority of the existing House of Assembly (which was largely elected by white Rhodesians). Over the summer of 1977 he continued to warn that insistence on capitulation to the Patriotic Front would produce a white backlash and put negotiations back.|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery from MTV News {{reviewed}} the video for [...] "My First Kiss" [...] positively. Montgomery commented on how simple the song's video was but noted that wasn't a negative, he commented, [...] "like {{pretty much everything}} 3OH!3 do, there's an undeniable charm to both the song and the video. Perhaps it's the power-tool chorus, or the [...] "ooh-ooh-ooh" [...] vocal harmonies. Maybe it's Kesha's sexy ass. Or maybe I just like watching {{a whole bunch of}} people lock lips. The <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> a lot of fun. It gets in your head. And hey, it's the summer — school's out, and gleefully stupid is in." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of release, both Record Mirror and NME gave the album four stars out of five. Record Mirror commented that [...] "he {{psychedelic}} image of the group really comes to life, record wise, on this LP which is a fine showcase for both their talent and the recording technique. Plenty of mind blowing sound, both blatant and subtle here, and the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> extremely well performed." [...] Cash Box called it [...] "a particularly striking collection of driving, up-to-date rock ventures". Paul McCartney and Pink Floyd's past producer Joe Boyd both rated the album highly. Some voiced {{the opinion of the}} underground fans, by suggesting that the album did not reflect the band's live performances.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, lead vocalist Hayley Williams explained [...] "That whole time for our band was such a dark season. It was emotionally exhausting, {{and by the time}} we got around to the point where we were going to start writing, we just really wanted to enjoy the process of making an album..." [...] when asked about the direction of the band after Brand New Eyes. Regarding the album being self-titled, Williams explained [...] "The self-titled aspect of the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> definitely a statement. I feel like it's not only reintroducing the band to the world, but even to ourselves ... By the end of it, it felt like we're a new band." ...|$|E
500|$|TV Guide {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars, noting: [...] "While very {{little in the way of}} horrific action takes place in The Seventh Victim, the film has a haunting, lyrical, {{overwhelming}} sense of melancholy and despair to it—death is looked upon as a sweet release from the oppression of a cold, meaningless existence." [...] They considered its conclusion [...] "without a doubt the bleakest ending to any film ever made in Hollywood." [...] Time Out London also praised the film, calling it Robson's [...] "masterpiece, a brooding melodrama built around a group of Satanists... the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> held together by a remarkably effective mix of menace and metaphysics—half noir, half Gothic." ...|$|E
50|$|Many rebels {{believed}} the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> simply {{intended as a}} scare, declaring that McNeil did not dare {{to carry out the}} threat.|$|R

500|$|Fleury {{remained}} {{embroiled in}} controversy at the 2005 Allan Cup tournament. The Thunder were repeatedly accused of paying players despite being an amateur team, and Fleury angrily denied rumours {{that he was}} secretly being paid $100,000. Tournament fans were extremely hostile towards the Thunder, and after it was eliminated in the semi-finals Fleury accused them of racism and threatened to return his 2002 Olympic gold medal: [...] "The one thing that's really bothered me through this <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> the prejudice, still, in this country {{when it comes to}} native people. I've seen it first-hand in every building we go into, how these people are treated, and it's absolutely embarrassing to be a Canadian and know that stuff is still going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Charley Rogulewski of Vibe said [...] "The old Nicki Minaj {{is back on}} {{her latest}} track [...] "Freedom."", while going onto note the songs [...] "dreamy" [...] {{production}} and compared it to [...] "Right Thru Me," [...] "Your Love" [...] and [...] "Save Me" [...] off her debut album. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Kyle Anderson called the song [...] "middle-of-the-road R" [...] and criticized Minaj for choosing to make music that appeals to pop radio, instead of being unique. Josiah Hughes of Exclaim! was critical of the song, saying it was: [...] "by-the-books Nicki, as she delivers venomous raps on the verses before giving saccharine-sweet melody a whirl on the choruses. Surprise, surprise — the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> delivered atop poppy, crystal clear synths." ...|$|E
500|$|In the first, {{canonical}} ending, the Boss lets Killbane escape {{in order}} to disarm the explosives, killing Cyrus's lieutenant Kia in the process. With STAG's crimes exposed, the Saints are hailed {{by the people of}} Steelport as heroes. Killbane is subsequently killed while trying to organize an invasion of Earth from Mars, but the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> then revealed to be the final scene from [...] "Gangstas In Space", a film financed by the Saints and starring the Boss. In the second, alternate ending, the Boss kills Killbane, but the destruction of the monument gives STAG the opportunity to launch [...] "Daedalus", a floating aircraft carrier helmed by Cyrus himself. After destroying the Daedalus with a series of bombs, the Boss, now armed with STAG weaponry and equipment, declares Steelport an independent nation ruled by the Saints.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rats!" [...] he said, [...] "I'm dreaming. There couldn't {{be a war}} like that. We're too civilized. I {{can prove}} the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>'s</b> impossible." ...|$|R

500|$|In {{the face}} of ongoing media {{speculation}} and public pressure to cancel the race due to ongoing political instability in Bahrain, the FIA released a statement at the Chinese Grand Prix confirming that the Bahrain Grand Prix would go ahead as planned. The week preceding the Grand Prix saw a renewed wave of protests against the government's attempts use the race to [...] "tell the outside world that the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> back to normal", while human rights organisations including Amnesty International criticised the decision to hold the race amid the violent crackdowns. Three days before the race, a group of Force India mechanics travelling in an unmarked hire car {{were involved in a}} petrol bombing incident at an impromptu roadblock and were briefly exposed to tear gas fired by security forces. There were no injuries or damage, but two of the mechanics involved chose to leave the country. The team later announced their intentions to race despite the incident.|$|E
500|$|Quatermass 2 {{received}} mixed reviews. Campbell Dixon in The Daily Telegraph {{found the}} film “all good grisly fun, {{if this is}} the sort of thing you enjoy”. The reviewer in The Times remarked that “the writer of the original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally”. On the other hand, Jympson Harman of the London Evening News wrote: “Science-fiction hokum can be convincing, exciting or just plain laughable. Quatermass II [...] fails on all these scores, I am afraid”. Similarly, the reviewer in the Daily Herald felt “The <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> daft and full of stilted dialogue. [...] At the end a detective says: “How am I going to make a report on all this?” I felt the same way”.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Brown and Bieber {{interacting}} with their girlfriends while the song [...] "All Back" [...] by Chris Brown is playing. Bieber's love interest is removed by her father, who reprimands, [...] "You {{will never see}} him again. You understand that?" [...] Brown is thinking of his girlfriend (played by Shannon Elizabeth) before the apocalypse occurs, which is characterized by land fissures, buildings toppling down and fiery scenery. Brown searches for his love interest who is then hit by the car that Bieber's girlfriend is in. Brown saves her by leaping over the fissure. Near {{the end of the}} video, Bieber's girlfriend finds him on top of the roof of a building and it ends with them reuniting and kissing. Interspersed are scenes of Brown and Bieber dancing amongst the destruction. Jamie Peck of MTV wrote of the video, [...] "The <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> delightfully ridiculous in its cinematic drama". The video was nominated for International Artist Video of the Year at the 2012 MuchMusic Video Awards.|$|E
5000|$|... "The <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> such {{a horrendous}} {{experience}} {{it could have}} come right out of S.O.B.," [...] said Edwards. [...] "In fact it inspired me to write S.O.B. 2." ...|$|R
