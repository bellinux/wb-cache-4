5|$|Bonaparte {{restored}} Lafayette's citizenship on 1 March 1800, and he {{was able}} to recover some of his properties. The ruler offered to make Lafayette minister to the United States, but was met <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> refusal, as Lafayette would not have anything to do with Napoleon's government. In 1802, Lafayette was part of the tiny minority that voted no in the referendum that made Bonaparte consul for life. Bonaparte offered to appoint Lafayette to the Senate and to bestow the Legion of Honor upon him, but Lafayette declined, though he stated he would gladly have taken the honors from a democratic government.|$|E

After controlling for firm size, risk, liquidity, and growth potential, we find higher returns among value stocks <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small <b>firm</b> size and low growth potential in Hong Kong and Malaysia. In Japan and Singapore, higher returns are found in growth portfolios <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small <b>firm</b> size and low growth potential.

All of Citi Bike's bicycles were to be renovated to include this new design. However, in 2016, a thousand of the newly redesigned Citi Bikes were taken out of service due to {{a part in the}} front wheel degrading faster than expected.

In October 2016, UPS Airlines ordered 14 -8Fs to add capacity, along with 14 options, which doubles its official backlog of 15 – including some to refractory airlines – and could extend production by two more years.|$|E
5|$|The {{limited time}} {{left in the}} game meant there was little chance the Hokies could make good the 20-point deficit. Tech's hopes flared after Nebraska's kickoff was {{returned}} 67 yards to the Nebraska 25-yard line, providing a chance for a quick score. Druckenmiller completed a 14-yard pass after the long return, giving Tech a first down at the 11-yard line, but the Hokies were unable to advance the ball much further. Oxendine ran for five yards, but Druckenmiller threw three incomplete passes, turning the ball over on downs. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> lead, Nebraska proceeded to run four short rushes, running out the clock and bringing the game to an end. Nebraska won the 63rd Orange Bowl, 4121.|$|E

5|$|In 1898, {{he moved}} to Second Division Grimsby Town. Though now playing in the {{professional}} Football League, Chapman was still an amateur at this stage and obtained a job <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> of local solicitors to earn his way. Grimsby started the season poorly – they were {{near the bottom of}} the division by Christmas and were beaten 7–0 by Preston North End in the FA Cup, but rallied to finish tenth at the end of the 1898–99 season. By this time Chapman had been dropped from the team, having been unsuccessfully moved to centre forward, an unfamiliar position for him. He was released by Grimsby and drifted down into non-league football with a brief spell at Swindon Town, playing three games and scoring twice, but had to leave the club as he was unable to find a job in the area. He moved on to see out the season with Sheppey United, who finished bottom of the Southern League in 1899–1900. Chapman finished as United's top scorer but was injured at the end of this season, and still unable to find a job. Disheartened, he returned to his home town and turned out for Worksop Town of the Midland League in 1900–01, while resuming his studies, this time at Old Firth College in Sheffield.|$|E
5|$|<b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm</b> {{lead and}} now in {{possession}} of the ball, Virginia Tech began to run out the clock by executing short rushing plays up {{the center of the}} field. Since the game clock does not stop in American college football if a player remains in bounds short of the first down marker, the Hokies could hasten {{the end of the game}} and preserve their lead by following this strategy. From their one-yard line, Taylor ran the ball for a one-yard gain, followed by two rushes by Evans for another four yards. The Hokies prepared to punt the ball, but during the kick, Cincinnati committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty by tackling Tech punter Brent Bowden. The penalty gave Virginia Tech a first down and kept their drive going. From the Tech 21-yard line, Evans was stopped for a loss of one yard, but broke free for an 11-yard gain and a first down on the next play. As the clock continued to tick down, Cincinnati began to use its timeouts in an effort to stop the clock after each play. This strategy was partially successful, as Tech was denied another first down and punted with 2:31 remaining in the game.|$|E

While {{the industry}} structure view explains superior returns <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm's</b> membership in <b>an</b> industry <b>with</b> specific structural characteristics, and the resource-based view explains superior returns with firm heterogeneity, the relational view argues that idiosyncratic interfirm linkages {{are a source}} of relational rents.|$|R
40|$|Corporate Social Capital {{has been}} {{receiving}} increasing attention in {{recent study of}} organizations. In this paper we focus our attention on strategic orientation of firms and reveal the ways they {{are affected by the}} social structure in which they are embedded. We focus on the way strategic orientation is socially determined and diffused. Our empirical application analyses 100 Israeli software firms, operating in four industrial districts. We reveal five generic business orientations. Applying corporate social capital as a framework, we find that similarity in business orientation is significantly associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> position in the inter-organizational network and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> geographic location. Both network position and geographic location serve as a pool of social resources for adopting firm strategic style, deem successful in a highly uncertain sector thus creating corporate social capital...|$|R

40|$|Banks {{have been}} heavily {{involved}} in securitization. We study whether the involvedness of <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> main bank into different types of securitization activity – asset backed securities (ABS) and covered bonds – influences credit supply {{before and during the}} 2007 - 8 financial crisis. Both types of securitization allow the bank to generate liquidity. To the extent that ABS activity lowers lending standards in normal times, banks with more ABS activity may reduce their lending more in crisis times as an ex-post effect of a previously higher risk adoption. Employing a disequilibrium model to identify credit rationing, we find that <b>a</b> longer relationship <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> main bank considerable improve credit supply. In general, we find that <b>a</b> relationship <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bank that is more involved in securitization activities relaxes credit constraints in normal periods. In contrast, while <b>a</b> relationship <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> main bank that issues covered bonds reduces credit rationing during crisis periods, the issuance of asset backed securities by <b>a</b> <b>firm’s</b> main bank aggravates these firm’s credit rationing in crisis periods. status: publishe...|$|R
