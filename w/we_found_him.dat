500|$|She {{was noted}} for {{achieving}} her goals. Dr. Robert Weaver, who also served in Roosevelt's Black Cabinet, said of her, [...] "She {{had the most}} marvelous gift of effecting feminine helplessness in order to attain her aims with masculine ruthlessness." [...] When a white Daytona resident threatened Bethune's students with a rifle, Bethune worked to make an ally of him. The director of the McLeod Hospital recalled, [...] "Mrs. Bethune treated him with courtesy and developed such goodwill in him that <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> protecting the children and {{going so far as}} to say, 'If anybody bothers old Mary, I will protect her with my life.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the verdict}} was read to the court, Denis Collins, {{a member of the}} jury and a {{journalist}} who has written for The Washington Post and other newspapers, spoke to the press. According to Collins, some in the jury felt sympathy for Libby and believed he was only the [...] "fall guy". Collins said that [...] "a number of times" [...] the jurors asked themselves, [...] "what is [...] doing here? Where is Rove and all these other guys. I'm not saying we didn't think Mr. Libby was guilty of the things <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> guilty of. It seemed like he was, as Mr. Wells [...] put it, he was the fall guy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{departure}} of Guns, the group continued and toured in support of Waking the Dead with the lineup, in 2003, consisting of Lewis, Riley, Hamilton, former guitarist Brent Muscat and new guitarist Keri Kelli (formerly of Big Bang Babies and Slash's Snakepit). The group eventually recruited guitarist Stacey Blades, with both Muscat and Kelli departing the group, in 2004 while they also released the cover album, titled Rips the Covers Off, the same year. Commenting on Blades addition to the lineup, Lewis stated that [...] "Stacey really is a virtuoso type of guy and player. It was really fortunate that <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> and that he's another Hollywood guy. I’ve read reviews where they called him a Tracii [...] clone, but he's not. He is definitely his own man." ...|$|E

60|$|I called Kantos Kan's name aloud in {{each new}} {{corridor}} and compartment, and finally I was rewarded by hearing a faint response. Guided by the sound, <b>we</b> soon <b>found</b> <b>him</b> helpless {{in a dark}} recess.|$|R
60|$|He {{came to his}} senses--that is to say, {{he opened}} his eyes and looked vacantly about him--between four and five hours after the time when <b>we</b> had <b>found</b> <b>him</b> on the floor of the workshop.|$|R
2500|$|According to Kerouac, On the Road [...] "was {{really a}} story about two Catholic buddies roaming the country in search of God. And <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>him.</b> I found him in the sky, in Market Street San Francisco (those 2 visions), and Dean (Neal) had God {{sweating}} out of his forehead all the way. THERE IS NO OTHER WAY OUT FOR THE HOLY MAN: HE MUST SWEAT FOR GOD. And once he has found Him, the Godhood of God is forever Established and really must not be spoken about." [...] According to his [...] biographer, historian Douglas Brinkley, On the Road has been misinterpreted as a tale of companions out looking for kicks, {{but the most important}} thing to comprehend is that Kerouac was an American Catholic author – for example, virtually every page of his diary bore a sketch of a crucifix, a prayer, or an appeal to Christ to be forgiven.|$|E
2500|$|Mozart himself, {{during his}} short stay in Dresden, {{was an almost}} daily visitor to the Körners' house. For the charming and witty Doris he was all aflame and with his south German vivacity he paid her the naïvest compliments. He {{generally}} came shortly before dinner and, after he had poured out a stream of gallant phrases, he sat down to improvise at the pianoforte. In the next room the table was meanwhile being set and the soup dished up, and the servant announced that dinner was served. But who could tear himself away when Mozart was improvising! The soup was allowed to grow cold and the roast to burn, simply {{so that we could}} continue to listen to the magic sound which the master, completely absorbed in what he was doing and unaware {{of the rest of the}} world, conjured from the instrument. Yet one finally grows tired even of the highest pleasures when the stomach makes known its demands. After the soup had grown cold a few times while Mozart played, he was briefly taken to task. [...] "Mozart", said Doris, gently laying her snow-white arm on his shoulder, [...] "Mozart, we are going in to dine; do you want to eat with us?" [...] But it was precisely Mozart who never did come; he played on undisturbed. Thus we often had the rarest Mozartian musical accompaniment to our meal, Doris concluded her narrative, and when we rose from table <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> still sitting at the keyboard.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> just at dusk {{seated at}} a little table beneath a tree.|$|E
6000|$|... "'It is enough, mademoiselle, that I know it,' I said. 'My {{master and}} I {{have come to}} Paris, {{expressly}} to find Monsieur de Laville; and when <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> <b>him,</b> to aid him to make his escape. Do not hesitate to confide in me, for only so shall we succeed in the object of our journey.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{higher than}} this," [...] {{retorted}} the gypsy, {{holding her hand}} level with her brow. [...] "Confess, Mr. Dishart, {{that this is the}} exact height of what you were thinking about. See, Nanny, he is blushing as if I meant that he had been thinking about me. He cannot answer, Nanny: <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> <b>him</b> out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] and the sergeant's {{tone was}} very significant. [...] "If he were still above the prairie-sod <b>we</b> should have <b>found</b> <b>him.</b> But {{there was a}} bit freshet last night--and I am expecting him." ...|$|R
60|$|MAN. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>him,</b> your worship, a plundering o' Bishop Winchester's house; he says he's a poor gentleman.|$|E
60|$|An amazing change, {{one night}} of {{solitude}} had wrought! Pale and languid, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> reclining: {{one hand on}} his throbbing temples.|$|E
60|$|WILLIAM. When he {{was here}} in Normandy, He loved us and we him, because <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>him.</b> A Norman of the Normans.|$|E
60|$|But retreat {{was not so}} easy. Not {{only were}} the troops weak and {{exhausted}} from want of supplies, but the enemy had been much encouraged by our long inaction. Of Wellington we had no great fear. <b>We</b> had <b>found</b> <b>him</b> to be brave and cautious, but with little enterprise. Besides, in that barren country his pursuit could not be rapid.|$|R
60|$|This horrible vision {{passed and}} was succeeded by one more, that of Oro {{standing}} in the sepulchre of the cave {{by the side of}} the crystal coffin which contained what appeared to be the body of his daughter. He gazed at her, then drank some potion and laid himself down in the companion coffin, that in which <b>we</b> had <b>found</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|M. C---- {{received}} us politely, and <b>we</b> <b>found</b> with <b>him</b> {{one of his}} somnambules; but as she {{had just}} come out of a trance, we were told she could not be put asleep again that morning. Our first visit, therefore, went no farther than some discourse on the subject of [...] "animal magnetism," [...] and a little practical by-play, that shall be related in its place.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ben is Miss Celia's boy. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> most starved in the coach-house, and he's {{been here}} ever since," [...] {{answered}} Bab, comprehensively.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} we were both ready, {{and we went to}} Checco. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> seated at a table {{polishing}} a dagger.|$|E
6000|$|Scant raiment had he round him, [...] Nor purse, nor worldly gear, [...] Hungry and faint <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>him,</b> [...] And bade him welcome here.|$|E
60|$|The nearest {{way to the}} garden, {{on going}} out of my lady's sitting-room, was by the {{shrubbery}} path, which you already know of. For the sake of your better understanding {{of what is now}} to come, I may add to this, that the shrubbery path was Mr. Franklin's favourite walk. When he was out in the grounds, and when we failed to find him anywhere else, <b>we</b> generally <b>found</b> <b>him</b> here.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are {{not leaving}} Kenton, because <b>we</b> have never <b>found</b> <b>him,</b> and since, as seems true, we only wander about aimlessly, {{would it not}} be wisest to think of the others, who rely upon us to point out the danger which may await them?" ...|$|R
60|$|We took up at a rural bar-room, {{after we}} had gone a few miles, an {{intoxicated}} gentleman who climbed upon the roof among the luggage, and subsequently slipping off without hurting himself, {{was seen in the}} distant perspective reeling back to the grog-shop where <b>we</b> had <b>found</b> <b>him.</b> <b>We</b> also parted with more of our freight at different times, so that when we came to change horses, I was again alone outside.|$|R
6000|$|... "And what do {{you intend}} to do, Mr. Marble? <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> a hard subject in clear weather; what can we do with him in thick?" ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{went to the}} [...] "Bull," [...] and inquired for Mr. Fothergill. He was in the coffee-room, we were told, {{and there}} <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> lunching.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but," [...] added Alice, with a sigh, [...] "when <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> here insensible, {{there was}} no letter on his person. He must have {{destroyed}} it." ...|$|E

And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth (ek Nazaret ἐκ Ναζαρὲτ)? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.|$|R
5000|$|.....apart {{from his}} gifts of games and {{a mass of}} civic buildings, <b>we</b> have {{recently}} <b>found</b> <b>him</b> offering {{to pay for the}} primary schooling of all the citizen-children at Xanthus, boys and girls alike"..."he gave funds for burial to people in need and paid the dowries of poor families' daughters" ...|$|R
60|$|This is the {{interesting}} conclusion. It {{is on this}} degree of knowledge that we are asked to abandon the universal morality of mankind. When we have stopped the lover from marrying the unfortunate woman he loves, when <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> <b>him</b> another uproariously healthy female whom he does not love in the least, even then we have no logical evidence that the result {{may not be as}} horrid and dangerous as if he had behaved like a man of honour.|$|R
60|$|And {{without another}} word he lifted his spear in salutation, and {{returned}} towards the camp, where shortly afterwards <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> cleaning a gun like any other Kafir.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{there the}} matter ended," [...] said Jodd. [...] "It was Olaf who walked the Hall of the Pit, not you. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> {{on the brink}} of the hole." ...|$|E
60|$|Presently Sounder slowed up and {{appeared}} at fault. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>him</b> puzzling over an open, grassy patch, and after nosing {{it for a}} little while, he began skirting the edge.|$|E
6000|$|... "An {{alliance}} with the house of Urbino," [...] answered Lodi. [...] "Guidobaldo has two nieces. We have sounded <b>him,</b> and <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> <b>him</b> well disposed towards such a marriage as we suggested. Allied thus {{to the house of}} Montefeltro, we should receive not only assistance from Guidobaldo, but also from the lords of Bologna, Perugia, Camerino, and some smaller states whose fortunes are linked already to that of Urbino. Thus we should present to Cesar Borgia a coalition so strong that he would never dare to bring a lance into our territory." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} will be well for us to follow his advice," [...] said Judge Bullfinch, after a pause. [...] "The bluejay is an able bird, and has had much experience. Besides, <b>we</b> have ever <b>found</b> <b>him</b> just and honorable since the time we made him our policeman, so I feel that we may depend upon him in this emergency." ...|$|R
60|$|Many traces <b>we</b> <b>found</b> of <b>him</b> in the bog-girt {{island where}} he had hid his savage ally. A huge {{driving-wheel}} and a shaft half-filled with rubbish showed the position of an abandoned mine. Beside it were the crumbling remains of the cottages of the miners, driven away no doubt by the foul reek of the surrounding swamp. In one of these a staple and chain with a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined. A skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the debris.|$|R
