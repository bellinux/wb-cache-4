5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>worthier</b> <b>title</b> {{can be avoided}} by naming specific people, or classes of people (e.g. [...] "my children"), instead of using the phrase [...] "my heirs". As such, the {{doctrine of}} <b>worthier</b> <b>title</b> seldom comes into play. The doctrine has also been abolished, either by statute or by judicial decisions, in many common law jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, the rule survives, but only as a presumption or a rule of construction, that can be rebutted by evidence that the grantor meant otherwise.|$|E
50|$|The {{remainder}} interest Caleb and Dinah {{were meant}} {{to have in the}} land subject to Beulah's life estate would have been a vested interest as the conveyance was written, but that vested interest is wiped out by the doctrine of <b>worthier</b> <b>title.</b> Imagine then that Adam then falls on hard times, and his creditors take judgments against him. If the deed were given effect as written, Caleb and Dinah's vested rights to the remainder interest would have existed prior to any judgment liens, and would therefore be prior in right to the claims of Adam's creditors. The doctrine of <b>worthier</b> <b>title,</b> preferring title by intestate succession over title by the instrument, wipes out that vested interest and prefers the rights of Adam's creditors over the rights of Adam's heirs. This illustrates that although the doctrine of <b>worthier</b> <b>title,</b> by its terms, does not affect the right passed from the ancestor to the heir, it can operate to cut off rights of the heirs against third parties.|$|E
50|$|But if {{the heir}} {{receives}} the same {{interest in the}} property {{that he would have}} received either way, the doctrine of <b>worthier</b> <b>title</b> would appear at first impression to be a distinction without a difference.|$|E
25|$|The College derives {{its name}} from Belgian Priest and Cardinal Joseph Cardijn, known for his work {{founding}} the Young Christian Workers organisation. Cardijn's decision to spend his life bringing Christianity back to working class (through imprisonment for his activities, to the opposition of the movement from the Church itself), was an inspiration to many, and was considered a <b>worthy</b> <b>title</b> for the College.|$|R
50|$|Davis was {{a partner}} in the firm of Wesley & Davis of London, {{publisher}} of religious tracts and such <b>worthy</b> <b>titles</b> as Life of William Grimes, the Runaway Slave and Samuel Wilderspin's Early discipline (both 1832). Business may have been precarious, as in 1837 he and his wife Mary and four children were among the earliest emigrants to South Australia, aboard Lord Goderich, arriving in April 1838.|$|R
50|$|Mario Kart Arcade GP (lead=yes) is an arcade-only {{iteration}} of Nintendo's Mario Kart series, {{developed by}} Namco. Designed for the Triforce arcade board (also used for F-Zero AX), players can race {{as one of}} eleven characters on twenty-four tracks. On certain machines, for an additional fee, a player's data can be saved on a magnetic card which can be inserted into the machine again later to retain unlocked items and records.

50|$|In {{the common}} law of England, the {{doctrine}} of <b>worthier</b> <b>title</b> was a legal doctrine that preferred taking title to real estate by descent over taking title by devise or by purchase. It essentially provides that a remainder cannot be created in the grantor's heirs, at least not by those words.|$|E
5000|$|But Adam {{does have}} a will: It firstly leaves his land [...] "to Edward for life, then to Adam's heirs", and it also {{contains}} a residuary clause that leaves the remainder of Adam's estate to Fran. By {{the operation of the}} instrument, Edward would have a life estate in the land, while Fran would inherit the rest of the estate immediately; then [...] "Adam's heirs"i.e., Dinahwould have a vested remainder interest in the land, and expect to inherit it upon Edward's death. The doctrine of <b>worthier</b> <b>title</b> intervenes, however, with unexpected results. The doctrine prefers the interest [...] "Adam's heirs" [...] would have taken to the interest created by an instrument. Here, however, Adam's will designates Fran as his heir at law. Instead of a life estate in Edward, followed by a vested remainder in Dinah, the doctrine of <b>worthier</b> <b>title</b> operates to disinherit Dinah completely, treats the interest of the heirs as a mere reversion, and upon Edward's death gives the land, as well, to Fran.|$|E
50|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>worthier</b> <b>title</b> can also affect estates created by will, when those estates are {{in people who}} would not take by intestate succession. Suppose once more that Adam is a testator; Adam's good friends in life were Edward and Fran, and Adam's surviving child is Dinah. Under applicable state laws of intestate succession, Dinah would be Adam's heir if Adam had no will.|$|E
60|$|I {{knew that}} she was coming, but I saw her first at the gallery's end, the roses she held red against the white linen of her gown. Then I felt a great yearning and a great dread. I have seen many of her kind since, and none {{reflected}} so truly as she the life of the old regime. Her dress, her carriage, her air, all suggested it; and she might, as Nick said, have been walking in the gardens of the Trianon. Titles I cared nothing for. Hers alone seemed real, to put her far above me. Had all who bore them been as <b>worthy,</b> <b>titles</b> would have meant much to mankind.|$|R

50|$|It is {{a classic}} example of common law legal {{reasoning}} and the logic involved in the interpretation of legal text which is why it continues to be an important teaching tool in the study of the common law. However, while it is an important interpretation tool, it should not be confused with a rule of construction (such as the Doctrine of <b>worthier</b> <b>title)</b> as it is a rule of law. The distinction is that a rule of law cannot be overcome by proof of the grantor's intent, while a rule of construction can be.|$|E
5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>worthier</b> <b>title,</b> like the Rule in Shelley's Case, had its origin in attempts by royal courts to defeat various devices contrived by lawyers during {{the era of}} feudalism to retain lands in their families while avoiding feudal duties, and to secure its free alienability. The creation of family settlements designed to preserve land within the family, transfer it without feudal duties due to the lords of the fee upon transfer at death, and preserve it from claims of creditors, occupied the ingenuity of many common lawyers during the late Middle Ages. So did efforts to undo the restrictions placed by ancestors once they became inconvenient. These concerns underlie the explanation given in Coke on Littleton: ...|$|E
40|$|Often {{personal}} injury victims who will need costly medical assistance {{throughout their lives}} will direct any settlement or judgment they receive into a “Special Needs Trust” (SNT). Federal law allows these individuals to use the trust funds to supplement the medical assistance that is available from basic Medicaid benefits {{so long as the}} SNT is an irrevocable trust. Recently, the Social Security Administration (SAA) has disqualified certain trusts, even though they are specifically designated as irrevocable trusts, by applying arcane doctrines from English feudal law, such as the Doctrine of <b>Worthier</b> <b>Title.</b> The article explains these doctrines and examines examples of inconsistent or faulty application of the doctrines by the SSA. The article concludes with a recommendation that the SSA cease its administratively burdensome and at times inappropriate attempts to apply these doctrines and adopt a simple rule that respects that a SNT that is designated as “irrevocable” is in fact irrevocable...|$|E
