40|$|Usage of <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> in {{manufacturing}} processes, {{has been known}} for many decades. A wide range of engineering materials can be cut by <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> with satisfactory results. Enhanced reliability and efficiency of the technique, have yielded the technology greater interest for manufacturing applications. <b>Water</b> <b>jets</b> are used to cut soft materials such as wood, plastics, aluminium and copper. Abrasive <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> are used to cut very hard materials such as titanium, inconel, glass and ceramics. It is impossible to cut these materials with classical cutting technics. A <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> processing system utilises water pressure in the range of 100 Mpa- 400 Mpa, for the different applications. In abrasive <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> milling and abrasive <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> cutting processes, the pressure of the jet is about 400 Mpa. In <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> surface penning, the jet pressure is about 100 Mpa. The process of abrasives mixing with the water stream is a complex phenomena. Erosion processes involved in cutting not yet fully understood. The lack of understanding the process call for other strategies in finding appropriate ways to obtain a precision depth in cutting operation.

50|$|Holes or gaps {{have to be}} left in {{the pipes}} to allow water to {{transfer}} from the subsoil to the pipe and these tend to block with soil or allow silt into the pipe, so blocking it or reducing the flow of water. This can be partially overcome by surrounding the pipes with gravel. However, with time even the gravel becomes choked with soil/silt, so in the latest practice, the gravel is surrounded with a geotextile material which filters out soil particles. Ideally, land drains are laid with access points so that high pressure <b>water</b> <b>jetting</b> is possible to clear silt. However, whatever the technology, all land drains have a finite life and eventually become ineffective due to the ingress of silt and/or the blocking of the surrounding filter media.|$|E

Edging the pool were metal reeds that concealed numerous jets for water; a swan that had <b>water</b> <b>jetting</b> from its beak occupied each corner. The center of the pool featured an iron tree with painted tin leaves that sprouted water from its branches. Because of this tree, the bosquet was {{also known as the}} Bosquet du Chêne Vert. In 1705, this bosquet was destroyed in order to allow for the creation of the Bosquet des Bains d’Apollon, which was created to house the statues had once stood in the Grotte de Thétys. During the reign of Louis XVI, Hubert Robert remodeled the bosquet, creating a cave-like setting for the Marsy statues. The bosquet was renamed the Grotte des Bains d'Apollon (Marie 1968, 1972, 1976, 1984; Thompson 2006; Verlet 1985).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The evolvement of rock {{fracture}} is {{a complicated}} and nonlinear dynamic problem.

The dynamic effect of rock was simulated by the dynamic contact method under high pressure <b>water</b> <b>jet.</b> The numerical simulation results showed that rock failure occurred within several milliseconds and the evolvement of it was for step under high pressure <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> and that the stress propagation in rock rapidly decayed with {{the distance from the}} jet centre.

Twenty healthy volunteers were placed on a toilet equipped with a bidet, and anorectal pressures were measured with a manometry catheter inserted into the rectum and anal canal before and after using the bidet at different water forces (40, 80, 160, 200 mN), temperatures (24 ℃ vs 38 ℃), and <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> widths (narrow vs wide).

40|$|Abstract: It is {{well known}} that a <b>water</b> <b>jet,</b> which after passing through an air layer plunges into a water pool, entrains into this an {{important}} amount of air and forms a submerged two-phase region of considerable interfacial area. Therefore, oxygen transfer occurs between bubble dispersion and the pool water. Reviewing existing studies on <b>water</b> <b>jets,</b> most of these works were carried out in circular nozzles. Earlier researchers indicated that the factors affecting the air entrainment characteristics of a <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> were nozzle diameter, <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> velocity, jet length, and jet angle. However, it is insufficient to investigate or discuss the characteristics of a <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> only by these four factors. An important factor that cannot be overlooked is the difference in nozzle shape. This paper investigates oxygen transfer efficiencies of vertical plunging <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> from different typed nozzles such as venturi and circular nozzles with and without air holes. A negative pressure occurred at the air holes of the venturi and the circular nozzles and this phenomenon affected the <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> expansion, the <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> shape, the bubble penetration depth and hence the oxygen transfer efficiency. It was demonstrated that the venturi nozzle with air holes had the higher oxygen transfer efficiencies than the other nozzles tested. Thus, using a simple venturi nozzle with air holes could lead to significantly increased oxygen transfer efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{characterisation}} of <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> {{to be used}} for washing out the filling of explosive ordnance. <b>Water</b> <b>jets</b> have advantages over conventional techniques in that they are non-polluting and can effectively disperse all compositions; pressed, cast, plastic and PBX. The <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> studied are produced by a gas gun consisting of a parallel barrel and a detachable tapered nozzle. Four nozzle designs were tested with exit-diameters ranging from 27 mm to 16 mm. A plastic piston regulates the volume of the water charge. For various combinations of water volume, breech pressure and nozzle diameter, high speed cine photography and flash radiography was used to characterise the <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> in terms of velocity and coherence. <b>Water</b> <b>jets</b> were achieved with jet-tip velocities between 100 and 600 m/s and breech pressures in the range of 30 - 100 MPa. The <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> have been fired at plastic explosive compositions and dispersed the explosive with little chance of initiating a reaction, even when heavily confined. The <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> is capable of penetrating moderate thicknesses of sheet metal so could be used where the explosive filling is directly accessible or thinly covered eg. fuse-well.
