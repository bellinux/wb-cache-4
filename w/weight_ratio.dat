40|$|AbstractIn this work, a {{new family}} of {{materials}} for electrodes of direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) is presented. Mesoporous carbon ceramics (MCCs) are obtained {{by the addition of}} commercial graphite into the synthesis gel of SBA- 15 mesoporous silica with SiO 2 /C <b>weight</b> <b>ratios</b> of 1 / 1 and 1 / 3.

The MCCs modified with Pt or PtRu are tested as DMFC electrodes and compared with the commercial support Vulcan XC- 72 R. When used as cathode, the system using MCC-SBA- 15 with SiO 2 /C <b>weight</b> <b>ratios</b> of 1 / 1 presents a negligible performance, while the MCC-SBA- 15 with SiO 2 /C <b>weight</b> <b>ratios</b> of 1 / 3 is 2. 9 times less active than the commercial support.

5|$|Operating an {{air-breathing}} {{jet engine}} at velocities {{of up to}} Mach5.5 poses numerous engineering problems; several previous engines proposed by other designers have worked well as jet engines, but performed poorly as rockets. This engine design aims {{to be a good}} jet engine within the atmosphere, as well as being an excellent rocket engine outside; however, the conventional problem posed by operating at Mach5.5 has been that the air coming into the engine rapidly heats up as it is compressed into the engine; due to certain thermodynamic effects, this greatly reduces the thrust that can be produced by burning fuel. Attempts to avoid these issues has typically resulted in the engine being much heavier (scramjets/ramjets) or has greatly reduced the thrust generated (conventional turbojets/ramjets); in either of these scenarios, the end result would be an engine that possesses a poor thrust to <b>weight</b> <b>ratio</b> at high speeds, which in turn would be too heavy to assist much in reaching orbit.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{fracture}} toughness of steel fibre-reinforced aluminosilicate geopolymers is investigated experimentally and is modelled by explicit finite element method. Nine geopolymeric pastes with various alkali activators to fly ash <b>weight</b> <b>ratios,</b> sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to sodium silicate <b>weight</b> <b>ratios,</b> NaOH concentrations and curing temperatures were prepared and their {{fracture toughness}} {{was measured by}} pre-notched three point bending specimens.

The result revealed that higher <b>weight</b> <b>ratios</b> and longer curing period contributed to increased strength of calcium carbonate, cement, and calcium carbonate + cement specimens. The calcium carbonate and the calcium carbonate + cement specimens in the same condition showed the tendency of decreased strength approximately 3 times and two times in comparison with the 8 % cement specimens cured for 28 days, but the tendency of increased strength was approximately 4 times and 6 times in comparison with the untreated specimen...|$|R
