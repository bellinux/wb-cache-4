25|$|An autobiographical {{memory is}} a {{personal}} representation of general or specific events and personal facts. Autobiographical memory also refers to memory of a person's history. An individual does not remember exactly everything {{that has happened in}} one's past. Memory is constructive, where previous experience affects how <b>we</b> <b>remember</b> events and what we end up recalling from memory. Autobiographical memory is constructive and reconstructed as an evolving process of history. A person's autobiographical memory is fairly reliable; although, the reliability of autobiographical memories is questionable because of memory distortions.|$|E

He also added, [...] "The first {{minute and a half}} of the track is mellow by his standards, but when the beat switches to Banks’ track, Eminem goes apeshit." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix gave a positive review and wrote that the freestyle sounds like a [...] "blast that sucks all the air out of room. It's better than anything on Relapse, and the sheer dexterity of his rhyming skills is awe-inspiring." [...] Thaindian Newss Madhuri Dey felt that [...] "Eminem takes his usual route of taking a hit at some personality".

500|$|The {{pastoral}} Epistles, too, {{give the}} impression of being in real places, with flesh-and-blood people, at specific times of day. Epistle 48 tells how the friends return to Stockholm by boat after a night out on Lake Mälaren, one summer morning in 1769. Each of its twenty-one verses paints a picture of a moment in the peaceful journey, from the wind stirring the fallen sails, the skipper's daughter coming out of her cabin, the cockerel crowing, the church clock striking four in the morning, the sun glimmering on the calm water. The effects may seem to be haphazard, but [...] "each stanza is a little picture, framed by its melody. <b>We</b> <b>remember</b> it all, seem to have lived through it, like a morning in our own lives." [...] Britten Austin calls it [...] "a new vision of the natural and urban scene. Fresh as Martin's. Detailed as Hogarth's. Frail and ethereal as Watteau's." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an issue}} of Catalyst, the Catholic League responded to Rosenberg's article. They argued that Rosenberg was biased against Catholics, in that he was content with the series lampooning Catholicism, but not other religions. They wrote, [...] "all along {{we have been told}} by Fox that none of our {{complaints}} were valid because none of the material was truly offensive. But now we have a Fox executive producer disingenuously giving away his hand by protesting why it should be okay to offend another group of people with the same material he initially said wasn't offensive to Catholics! And isn't it striking that Rosenberg is upset {{with the fact that the}} double standard—which now, for the first time works positively for Catholics—is a real problem. Never do <b>we</b> <b>remember</b> Rosenberg protesting the double standard that allows 'artists' to dump on Catholics while protecting most other segments of society from their assaults." [...] The League also complimented the members' participation, writing, [...] "It only goes to prove what can be done when Catholics get actively involved." ...|$|E
500|$|Ned Block {{proposed}} {{a distinction between}} two types of consciousness that he called phenomenal (P-consciousness) and access (A-consciousness). [...] P-consciousness, according to Block, is simply raw experience: [...] it is moving, colored forms, sounds, sensations, emotions and feelings with our bodies' and responses at the center. These experiences, considered independently of any impact on behavior, are called qualia. [...] A-consciousness, on the other hand, is the phenomenon whereby information in our minds is accessible for verbal report, reasoning, and the control of behavior. So, when we perceive, information about what we perceive is access conscious; when we introspect, information about our thoughts is access conscious; when <b>we</b> <b>remember,</b> information about the past is access conscious, and so on. [...] Although some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett, have disputed the validity of this distinction, others have broadly accepted it. [...] David Chalmers has argued that A-consciousness can in principle be understood in mechanistic terms, but that understanding P-consciousness is much more challenging: [...] he calls this the hard problem of consciousness.|$|E

500|$|Owen was {{diagnosed}} with prostate cancer in 2010, but he was later given {{a clean bill of}} health, which led to the band's reunion, without Herndon. Following a series of tornados destroying homes and businesses throughout their state in 2011, Alabama assembled a benefit concert in Birmingham, called Bama Rising. Featuring the band's first set since 2004, alongside Luke Bryan, Sheryl Crow and Brad Paisley, the concert raised $2.1 million. [...] "I guess we realized that maybe we missed the playing... and five or six years had gone by and we were like, 'Maybe that wasn't as bad as <b>we</b> <b>remember</b> it being,'" [...] said Gentry. In celebration of the group's 40th anniversary, Alabama resumed touring in 2013 for the Back to the Bowery tour, referencing the Myrtle Beach club where they first became professional musicians. They also undertook a short cruise, The Alabama & Friends Festival at Sea, which left for the Bahamas on Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Pearl ship. In addition, the band released Alabama & Friends, a tribute album encompassing covers from newer artists such as Jason Aldean and Florida Georgia Line, in addition to two new tracks by Alabama.|$|E
500|$|Early {{reviews of}} [...] "To Autumn" [...] focused {{on it as}} part of Keats's {{collection}} of poems Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems. An anonymous critic in the July 1820 Monthly Review claimed, [...] "this writer is very rich both in imagination and fancy; and even a superabundance of the latter faculty is displayed in his lines 'On Autumn,' which bring the reality of nature more before our eyes than almost any description that <b>we</b> <b>remember.</b> [...] If we did not fear that, young as is Mr K., his peculiarities are fixed beyond all the power of criticism to remove, we would exhort him to become somewhat less strikingly original,—to be less fond of the folly of too new or too old phrases,—and to believe that poetry does not consist in either the one or the other." [...] Josiah Conder in the September 1820 Eclectic Review mentioned, [...] "One naturally turns first to the shorter pieces, in order to taste the flavour of the poetry. The following ode to Autumn is no unfavourable specimen." [...] An anonymous reviewer in The Edinburgh Magazine for October 1820 added to a discussion of some of Keats's longer poems the afterthought that [...] "The ode to 'Fancy,' and the ode to 'Autumn,' also have great merit." ...|$|E
500|$|GamesRadar {{called it}} [...] "the point when the series became great." [...] In 2007, GamesRadar {{included}} four {{elements of this}} game - Dan Forden's [...] "Toasty!"

Reviewing the PlayStation 3 release in 2007, IGN's Jeff Haynes stated that [...] "Mortal Kombat II still manages to stand up almost 15 years later {{as one of the}} best arcade fighters around." [...] As late as 2009, many fans still considered MKII to be the best title in the series. According to a 2011 article by Mike Harradence of PlayStation Universe, the [...] "bigger, bolder and bloodier" [...] game remains [...] "a firm fan favourite among MK aficionados." [...] That year, IGN's Richard George wrote that [...] "Mortal Kombat II is considered by many to be the pinnacle of the series" [...] and called it [...] "still one of the most fun 16-bit fighters to play." [...] In 2013, Rich Knight and Hanuman Welch of Complex wrote that [...] "Mortal Kombat II took everything we loved about the original and magnified it by about a million. (...) We still love this game." [...] That same year, Knight and Gus Turner from the same magazine also ranked it as the sixth best 2D fighting game of all time, stating: [...] "Truth be told, the latest MK has nothing on this one. Nothing. A step up from the original in every way, MK II was, and still is, a solid, violent game that's an essential title to grab for any serious fan of fighting games." [...] In 2014, Kevin Wong of Complex wrote: [...] "Today, <b>we</b> <b>remember</b> Mortal Kombat II for its anarchic spirit: the game was endlessly intriguing and weird, and it had an uneasy atmosphere, anything could happen at any given moment. Critics derided Mortal Kombat as meaningless shock value, but its sequel proved those naysayers wrong. Mortal Kombat II was a Flawless Victory: irreverent, hilarious, and horrific in equal measures." ...|$|E
