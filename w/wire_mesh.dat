Certain 70 -mesh {{stainless steel}} <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> were {{placed under the}} cribriform ventilation device {{at the bottom of}} the experimental platform primary box. Coal granules cannot cross the steel <b>wire</b> <b>meshes,</b> so the cribriform ventilation device under the steel <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> would not be blocked by coal granules. With the steel <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> in place, a layer of stones (10  cm thick; 20, 10 and 5  mm diameter) was laid to enable even gas to charge. After the stone paving had been laid, several 70 -mesh steel <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> were placed on the stone layer. The stable stone pad forms the structure of the gas-charging base. The prepared coal is placed into a primary box and tamped. Pressure, stress and temperature sensors were placed in the coal sample at different layers and locations. The top shell was set in place and sealed. Leak detection was conducted to ensure that the experimental box was airtight.|$|R

Carbon fiber 12 k-prepregs, where carbon fibers were impregnated with epoxy, were laminated with <b>wire</b> <b>meshes,</b> vacuum bag-molded and hardened to manufacture hybrid-type specimens, with which an electromagnetic shield test was performed in accordance with ASTM D 4935 - 10, through which {{was known as the}} most excellent reproducibility is obtainable among electromagnetic shield tests. In addition, glass fiber prepregs whose electromagnetic shielding effect were known as insignificant were laminated and formed with <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> to verify the validity of {{the electromagnetic}} shield effect of <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> in order to confirm the electromagnetic shielding effect of metal meshes corresponding existing carbon fiber 12 k-prepregs.

5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{computational}} approach for designing <b>wire</b> <b>meshes,</b> i. e., freeform surfaces composed of woven wires {{arranged in a}} regular grid. To facilitate shape exploration, we map material properties of <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> to the geometric model of Chebyshev nets. This abstraction is exploited to build an efficient optimization scheme. While the theory of Chebyshev nets suggests a highly constrained design space, we show that allowing controlled deviations from the underlying surface provides a rich shape space for design explo- ration. Our algorithm balances globally coupled material constraints with aesthetic and geometric design objectives that can be specified by the user in an interactive design session. In addition to sculptural art, <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> represent an innovative medium for industrial ap- plications including composite materials and architectural fa c ̧ ades. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach {{using a variety of}} digital and physical prototypes with a level of shape complexity unobtainable using previous methods...|$|R

5|$|Lions {{were kept}} in cramped and squalid {{conditions}} at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages {{was built in the}} 1870s. Further changes took place in the early twentieth century, when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures more closely resembling a natural habitat, with concrete 'rocks', more open space and a moat instead of bars. He designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo, among others, in the early twentieth century. Though his designs were popular, the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos. In the later decades of the twentieth century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals, with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors, such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park.|$|E

However, further research is neces-sary to optimize the use of CSC for many applications, particularly in patients with darker skin types, and in procedures with deep-targeted chromophores. Study Design/Materials and Methods: With the objec-tive to enhance cryogen spray atomization and introduce a passive mass deposition control, stainless steel <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> of various sizes were positioned in the spray path of two nozzles of different diameters (0. 7 and 1. 4 mm). A temperature sensor placed at a fixed distance below the nozzle tips measured variations in temperature {{as a function of}} time. Calculations for heat flux (q), and overall heat extraction (Q) were done through an inverse heat conduction problem (IHCP) algorithm. Results: The use of <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> reduced maximum q and thus cooling efficiency for both nozzles. However, for the larger diameter nozzle (1. 4 mm), cooling duration was prolonged significantly when compared to the case without mesh, which led to an increase in Q. Conclusions: <b>Wire</b> <b>meshes,</b> within the range of wire diameters used, are not desirable for use with the smaller diameter nozzle because they reduce cooling efficiency. For the larger diameter nozzle, however, the prolonged cooling duration and increase in Q may be beneficial for laser dermatological procedures directed towards deeper tar-geted chromophores, such as hair removal.

5|$|Experience during {{operations}} later led to {{the development}} of specialised armoured equipment by Australian industry for use in jungle operations in the South West Pacific Area. A range of modifications were subsequently developed for the Matilda, including the fitting of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> screens or metal tracking over the engine and air louvres to protect it against magnetic mines, an armoured shield on top of the hull to protect the turret ring, a microphone and headset attached to the rear to act as a telephone for infantry co-operation, waterproofing equipment for deep wading, a tank dozer, a flamethrowing tank called the Matlida Frog, and one capable of firing a salvo of naval mortar bombs, known as the Matilda Hedgehog. The Frog was capable of projecting a flame , while the Hedgehog was designed to fire multiple projectiles at concrete blockhouses. Used in combat in the final year of the war in support of Australian infantry at Balipapan, the Frog proved a successful adaptation. Trials were also undertaken to fit air conditioning to the Matildas to improve the endurance of crews in tropical conditions. Limited modifications were also undertaken on the M3 Grant medium tanks, including the fitting of a small number of dozer variants and trials to waterproof the vehicles for wading.|$|E
5|$|Tang has {{expressed}} concern about environmental and social issues through his art, such as the works They Poach the Rhino, Chop Off His Horn and Make This Drink (1989), Under the Table All Going One Direction (1992) and Tiger's Whip. He first presented the latter work, an installation and performance piece, in 1991 in Singapore's Chinatown. It consisted of ten life-sized tigers made from <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> covered with white linen. Tang, wearing a sleeveless white garment, dragged one of the tigers behind him. A {{modified version of the}} installation is in the Singapore Art Museum. It features a tiger with its front paws resting {{on the back of a}} rocking chair, which is draped with a piece of red cloth and with a phallus painted on it in red. The work highlights how the tiger is being hunted to extinction for its penis, which some Chinese believe has aphrodisiac qualities. In February 1995, the Museum chose Tiger's Whip to represent Singapore at the Africus International Biennale in Johannesburg, South Africa. Another of Tang's works in the Singapore Art Museum is an untitled sculpture often called Axe (1991), which is an axe with a plant growing out of its wooden handle. It is regarded as an early example of found art in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Banking {{operations}} in Hampshire County ceased throughout {{the duration of}} the American Civil War, and a new banking institution was not established in Romney until 1888. By September of that year, a coordinated effort by Romney's leading citizens amassed subscriptions for the entirety of the initial offering of 300 shares of stock for the establishment of the Bank of Romney. The shareholders of the Bank of Romney petitioned the Secretary of State of West Virginia for a charter with capital stock totaling 30,000 USD. Following the state's approval of its charter, the Bank of Romney commenced its {{operations in}} the Wirgman Building on December 20, 1888. The bank occupied two rented rooms on the Wirgman Building's first floor, which it shared with a pharmacy. The bank initially used a safe as its bank vault and security for the bank was provided by a nightwatchman who slept in one of the bank office's two rooms. The Wirgman Building's security was further enhanced with the installation of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> glass and bars in the windows. During the bank's residency at the Wirgman Building, Henry Bell Gilkeson served as the bank's president. The Bank of Romney began to outgrow its spaces {{on the first floor of}} the Wirgman Building almost immediately after its incorporation, and in 1906 it moved across Main Street to a new bank building.|$|E

Straw wire {{aircraft}} {{sandwich panel}} {{is a new}} type of composite slab which consist of straw insulation core lamped between two welded <b>wire</b> <b>meshes.</b> Diagonal shear connectors connect two <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> to form an integrated frame. The straw insulation core (also known as straw board) is prepared from cut straw agglutinated by magnesium oxychloride cement (MOC). In order to study thermal conductivity of straw board, multi-group models were quantitatively investigated by the CD－DR 3030 A thermal conductivity meter. Five parameters, including the water－cement ratio, cement content, straw gradation, straw length, wettability were considered in the test. The results show that the thermal conductivity of straw board samples is in the range of 0. 08 ~ 0. 12 w/m·k, which indicates that the straw board has a good thermal insulation property. And the water －cement ratio, cement content, straw gradation, straw length, wettability has remarkable effects on the thermal conductivity of straw board...|$|R

The addition of TiO 2 nanopowders in the colloidal deposition solution enhanced the photocatalytic performance of the deposited TiO 2 layers in all the tested conditions. Moreover, {{increasing the number of}} coatings (from 1 to 4) improves the photocatalytic efficiency. The catalyst did not show reduced photoreactivity after four repeated cycles in water decontamination from methylene blue, and after up to 10 repeated cycles in nitrogen oxides photodegradation.

5|$|The {{main event}} steel cage match could be won only by {{climbing}} {{over the top}} of the cage all the way to the floor to win the match. Pinfalls and submission did not count, neither opponent could be disqualified, and the door to the cage would be locked for the entire match. As the cage lowered, Mike Tenay introduced the match and then handed the microphone over to AAA announcer Arturo Rivera to give the introductions in Spanish. Konnan came to the ring with both the IWC World Heavyweight Championship and the UWA Double Power Cup Championship that he had won from Perro Aguayo, although neither was on the line in the match. Once the door was locked, the two wrestlers began to brawl, with Aguayo trying to use Konnan as a ladder to climb out of the cage on more than one occasion. After a few minutes of fighting, Konnan dropped Aguayo face-first on the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> cage, causing Aguayo to bleed (either by sheer impact or Aguayo secretly cutting himself to sell the brutality of the match). Once Aguayo started to bleed, Konnan began to focus on attacking Aguayo's forehead, including rubbing Aguayo's face across the cage. Moments later, both wrestlers found themselves on the top rope, fighting each other as they held on to the cage until Aguayo knocked Konnan off the top rope. Moments later, Aguayo attempted a pinfall even though the rules stated a pinfall did not matter. As the match progressed, sweat began to mix with his blood, causing his face to turn red. As Aguayo tried to climb out of the ring, Konnan leapt up with a low blow to keep his opponent in the cage. At that point, the cameras showed Eddie Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend watching the show from backstage, then moments later leaving the backstage area. As Aguayo climbed the cage, Los Gringos came to ringside and threw a cup of liquid in Aguayo's face. He then passed a set of brass knuckles to Konnan to use in the match. While at ringside, Guerrero got into a fistfight with several fans who were upset over his actions, forcing the security guards to step in and stop the fight. Following the assist by Los Gringos Locos, Konnan continued to attack Aguayo, with Aguayo ending up with his face and chest covered in blood from his head wound. At one point, Guerrero attacked the ringside referee, Pepe Casas, preventing him from stepping into the cage to check on Aguayo. When Konnan tried to escape, Los Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000, and Universo 2000) ran to ringside, attacking Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend at ringside. As Konnan straddled the cage, Cien Caras climbed up and knocked Konnan off the top and back inside the cage, allowing Aguayo to attack his opponent. Moments later, Aguayo dove off the top rope with a double stomp on Konnan and then climbed out of the cage to victory.|$|E
