500|$|The {{match is}} {{considered}} to be the best Premier League game {{in the history of the}} competition. Newcastle's manager Kevin Keegan described it as a [...] "classic", while Liverpool manager Roy Evans said [...] "the entertainment value <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> with the best". In 2003, the game was awarded the Match of the Decade award on behalf of the Premier League, which was celebrating its tenth anniversary. The result influenced the league championship; the leaders Manchester United lost only one more match that season and retained the title.|$|E
500|$|Generally, {{critics and}} fans were {{disappointed}} Mr. Eko was killed after {{being on the}} show for only one season. Kristin Dos Santos of E! called Mr. Eko [...] "the best character of the show", and was therefore very disappointed with his death. In response to Mr. Eko's death, Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly stated [...] "I'll miss Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje—his acting <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> with Terry O'Quinn's, Elizabeth Mitchell's, and Michael Emerson's. I guess he was the sacrifice the island demanded". Writing for Zap2it, Rick Porter said that his death [...] "sucked hard, and loud, and long". IGN listed Eko's death as number one on its list of [...] "Top 10 Lost Deaths".|$|E
500|$|Rivette {{worked with}} scriptwriters Pascal Bonitzer and Christine Laurent using an {{automatic}} writing approach that involved writing the script day by day; {{the actors and}} filmmakers {{did not know the}} direction of the story in advance of each day's filming. Eurimages provided €420,000 of funding in July 2002, and the film was shot that autumn and winter. Rivette immediately thought of Béart, who starred in La Belle Noiseuse, to play the carnal Marie. Béart has said that [...] "Of all the films I've made, this was the one which most disturbed people very close to me. They said: 'It's almost as though the Emmanuelle we know <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> on the screen.'." [...] Béart's image in the media at the time was characterised by the near hysteria seen when she appeared naked on the cover of Elle in May 2003 after filming ended.|$|E

500|$|Tracy Hickman once ran the {{adventure}} as a Dungeon Master. According to him, {{the experience was}} like an old scary movie, with [...] "the obligatory castle high on the craggy cliff with the wolves howling in the woods. Sure enough, the vampire <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> in the castle. To {{most of the players}} it seemed like a straight forward task: find the vampire and kill him." [...] One player discovered Strahd's backstory and was so affected by it that {{when it came time to}} kill the vampire at the end of {{the adventure}}, despite having a sword capable of dispatching Strahd, he refused, and his companions were forced to complete the task. Afterwards, Hickman asked him why. [...] "He deserved to die better than that," [...] his friend said, to which Hickman replied [...] "Yes [...] But that is how it is with people who fall from greatness. He chose his end when he first chose to kill his brother. How could it be any different?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Partition" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava and was shot at the Parisian cabaret club, Crazy Horse. It was filmed quickly as Jay-Z had to travel to London for a concert after the shooting. In a video commentary to the album, Beyoncé said: [...] "The day that I got engaged was my husband's birthday and I took him to Crazy Horse. And I remember thinking, 'Damn, these girls are fly.' I {{just thought it was}} the ultimate sexy show I've ever seen. And I was like, 'I wish I <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> I wish I could perform that for my man...' So that's what I did for the video." [...] Talking about the video, Nava noted that for the shooting Beyoncé was trying to be [...] "even more risque than she's been in the past". While filming, he further tried to [...] "create and capture a bit of genuine intimacy" [...] between the singer and her husband. During a commentary about the video for the song, Beyoncé revealed her motivation to film it by saying, ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{critics have}} pointed out the song's {{similarities}} {{to some of the}} hits by the Police, Mars told MTV News that he did not intend to write anything mimicking by the Sting-fronted band. Instead, it came to him out of the blue, one night during his studio sessions prior to recording the Unorthodox Jukebox album. [...] "I don't think it initially tried to sound like anybody else, but I picked up the guitar and just started playing ," [...] Mars explained. [...] "That's how it normally works; I'll pick up a guitar and I'll start humming a melody, and I started singing that, and I <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> in Sting-ville, in that register, so that's what you get...". John Marx, a partner in the music division at William Morris Endeavor (WME), who was responsible for managing the Moonshine Jungle Tour said [...] "it's the type of song that really motivates people to purchase a ticket. It has that live element to it; it was a very active track".|$|E

I said nobody had <b>been</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> but I did go up myself to have a look round when I first settled down here, and there is a big bar with a padlock." ...|$|R

500|$|... "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] is a bass solo by Burton, {{accompanied}} on drums by Ulrich. A {{staple of}} Burton's live performances since {{his high school}} days in the band Agents of Misfortune, the instrumental track featured Burton's distinctive [...] "lead-bass" [...] style of playing, incorporating heavy distortion, use of wah-wah pedal and tapping. Bubacz introduces the track as [...] "Bass solo, take one", informing listeners that the song was recorded in one take. [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] was the bass solo that Burton was playing when Hetfield and Ulrich first saw him at a gig. Hetfield stated: [...] "We heard this wild solo going on and thought, 'I don't see any guitar player up there.' We were both counting the strings and I finally turned to Lars and said, 'Dude, that's a bass!' Cliff <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> on stage with his band Trauma with a wah-wah pedal and his huge mop of red hair. He didn't care whether people were there. He was {{looking down at his}} bass, playing." [...] "Whiplash" [...] was the album's first single, issued on August 8, 1983. It features a swift rhythm line of straight 16th notes played at about 200 beats per minute. Hetfield and Burton performed with palm muted technique and precise metronomic control. The lyrics celebrate crowd energy and headbanging. Rock journalist Mick Wall wrote that [...] "Whiplash" [...] signified the birth of thrash metal, stating: [...] "If one wishes to identify the very moment thrash metal arrived spitting and snarling into the world, 'Whiplash' is indisputably it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The publican {{got tired}} of it and thought the grisly-looking sight might be {{frightening}} off customers, so he stuck it up in an attic.

Beau slept {{in the corner of}} Stewart's bedroom, but would often crawl onto the bed between Stewart and his wife Gloria. Stewart recalled, [...] "he <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> because he wanted me to pat his head, so that’s what I would do. Somehow, my touching his hair made him happier, and just the feeling of him laying against me helped me sleep better." ...|$|E

[...] Bergman fouls off 7 pitches, and on a full count hits the 13th pitch into the upper deck at Tiger Stadium for a walk-off, 3-run home run.

2500|$|On July 31, 2007, Donaire met Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Donaire {{said the}} {{experience}} was, [...] "an overwhelming feeling. It was indescribable. The moment I {{walked up the}} stairs and she <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and when I looked it was a moment when I couldn't even look at her face. It was a great honor." [...] Then, on December 1, 2007, Donaire made the first defense of his IBF title against Luis Maldonado of Mexico by a technical knockout in the eighth round. Donaire said, [...] "I guess my validation was today but I didn't feel my best; I felt sluggish. I didn't have my legs. I don't know what the problem was. I couldn't move well so I tried to rely on my upper body movement." ...|$|E
2500|$|After nearly {{drinking}} {{himself to}} death during the shooting of The Klansman (1974), Burton was dried out at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Burton was allegedly inebriated while making the movie, {{and many of his}} scenes had to be filmed with him sitting or lying down due to his inability to stand upright. In some scenes, he appears to slur his words or speak incoherently. According to his own diaries, he used Antabuse to try to stop his excessive consumption of alcohol, which he blamed for wrecking his marriage to Elizabeth Taylor. Burton himself said of the time leading up to his near loss of life, [...] "I was fairly sloshed for five years. I <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> with John Barrymore and Robert Newton. The ghosts of them were looking over my shoulder." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{atmosphere}} at Edgbaston is {{reputed to be}} the most hostile in England for visiting teams. Former England captain Alec Stewart recalled [...] "On a world level I would put it up there with Eden Gardens in Calcutta, which holds about 100,000. It inspires a team. It's like having another man in your side." [...] and the former England wicketkeeper Geraint Jones describes how [...] "The crowd here makes such a big noise when you are doing well ... it's a unique environment." [...] After winning the 2015 Ashes Test Match with Australia at Edgbaston, England captain Alastair Cook commented [...] "The Edgbaston crowd <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> with the loudest I can remember. With some of the chants, even guys who have played a fair bit of cricket were looking at each other and realising how special it was. Edgbaston has been a fantastic venue for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the podium}} {{ceremony}} following the race, Rosberg was booed by the crowd, mirroring a similar incident towards {{him at the}} previous race in Belgium. Hamilton later told the press {{that he did not}} feel comfortable about the fans behaving in such a manner: [...] "I've had it here, years and years ago, and it's great personally for me to have such great support, from the Ferrari fans and the Mercedes fans. But when I <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> it was awkward for me to hear them booing Nico because I just don't like that in sport." [...] Wolff affirmed that booing should not be heard on the podium but acknowledged Formula One is an emotional sport for its fan base while also saying: [...] "It's a sport and sport should unite." [...] When asked about the booing in the press conference, Rosberg replied while it was [...] "not nice" [...] he hoped over time the fans would forgive him for his past actions. In the podium interviews, conducted by former driver Jean Alesi, Massa expressed his happiness on standing on the podium and was certain luck was beside him and that there was [...] "a lot more to come." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the V Museum, [...] "the {{photograph}} enshrines Che as a mythic hero. Taken from below, {{the revolutionary}} leader with searching eyes and resolute expression becomes larger than life. A perspective that dominates {{the imagery of}} social realism, it bears an irresistible aura of authority, independence and defiance." [...] The V Museum goes on to state that Korda's famous photograph first deified Che and turned him into an icon of radical chic. Its story, a complex mesh of conflicting narratives, gave Guerrillero Heroico {{a life of its}} own, an enduring fascination independent of Che himself. The Italian magazine Skime evokes even more praise, decreeing it [...] "absolutely the most famous of history" [...] while proclaiming that it [...] "captures beauty and youth, courage and generosity, aesthetic and moral virtues of a person who possessed all the characteristics necessary to be converted into a symbol of an epoch like ours, lacking in historic legends and mythic incarnations." [...] Journalist Richard Gott has also remarked that [...] "the red star in Che's beret <b>was</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> with 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. Jonathan Green, director of the UCR photography museum, has remarked that [...] "pop art is a rejection of traditional figuration, rhetoric, and rendition. Its egalitarian anti-art stance was the perfect corollary for Che's anti-establishment attitude." ...|$|E
