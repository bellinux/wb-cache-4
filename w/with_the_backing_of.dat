5|$|After Fan {{was forced}} to step down from his office, Wang Anshi (1021–1086) became Chancellor of the {{imperial}} court. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> Emperor Shenzong (1067–1085), Wang Anshi severely criticized the educational system and state bureaucracy. Seeking to resolve {{what he saw as}} state corruption and negligence, Wang implemented a series of reforms called the New Policies. These involved land value tax reform, the establishment of several government monopolies, the support of local militias, and the creation of higher standards for the Imperial examination to make it more practical for men skilled in statecraft to pass.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, the Kurosawa Film Studio {{was opened}} in Yokohama; two {{additional}} locations {{have since been}} launched in Japan. A large collection of archive material, including scanned screenplays, photos and news articles, has been made available through the Akira Kurosawa Digital Archive, a Japanese proprietary website maintained by Ryukoku University Digital Archives Research Center in collaboration with Kurosawa Production. Anaheim University's Akira Kurosawa School of Film was launched in spring 2009 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> Kurosawa Production.

5|$|In the 21st century {{there have}} been three large {{fundraising}} campaigns at the Gallery: in 2004, to buy Raphael’s Madonna of the Pinks, in 2008, for Titian's Diana and Actaeon, and in 2012, Titian's Diana and Callisto. Both Titians were bought in tandem with the National Gallery of Scotland for £95m. Both of these major works were sold from the famous collection of the Duke of Sutherland. The National Gallery is now largely priced out of the market for Old Master paintings and can only make such acquisitions <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> major public appeals; the departing director Charles Saumarez Smith expressed his frustration at this situation in 2007.|$|E

William de Warrenne had backed the duke during his campaign, however, and now found himself politically exposed. He was exiled and disseised of his English estates, including Castle Acre, until in 1103 the duke was able to persuade Henry to permit William to return and reclaim his lands.|$|E

5|$|Abu Bakar assumed {{office as}} the Temenggong of Johor {{within three days}} of his father's demise. At {{the time of his}} succession, Johor was facing a {{political}} threat from the deposed Sultan, Mahmud Muzaffar Shah. The Sultan was pursuing his sovereignty claims over Johor and Pahang and aimed to overthrow the Sultan of Terengganu <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> Siam. Mahmud Muzaffar Shah established an alliance with Tun Ahmad, half-brother and rival of the Bendahara Tun Koris. The alliance caused Abu Bakar concern that the fall of Tun Koris in Pahang would threaten his own political position in Johor. Abu Bakar signed a treaty of friendship with Tun Koris in June 1862, and sent a small expeditionary force to Pahang to support Tun Koris when war broke out in August 1862.|$|E
5|$|All {{four major}} {{networks}} {{turned down the}} new Star Trek series, as they were not willing to commit to a twenty-six-hour first season with a guaranteed unchanging time slot {{as well as a}} promotional campaign for the show. The team proceeded with the project <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> Paramount. Roddenberry began putting together a production crew which included colleagues who had worked with him on the original series, including Robert H. Justman, David Gerrold, and Eddie Milkis. Justman proposed three ideas to the others on October 17, including families on board the ship, a concept which later became the holodeck and both an android and a Klingon character. One idea discussed by the production team was for Deanna Troi to have three breasts to which writer D. C. Fontana objected.|$|E
5|$|Before Crichton's {{novel was}} published, four studios put in bids for its film rights. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> Universal Studios, Spielberg {{acquired}} the rights for $1.5 million before its publication in 1990; Crichton was hired {{for an additional}} $500,000 to adapt the novel for the screen. Koepp wrote the final draft, which left out much of the novel's exposition and violence and made numerous changes to the characters. Filming took place in California and Hawaii between August and November 1992, and post-production rolled until May 1993, supervised by Spielberg in Poland as he filmed Schindler's List. The dinosaurs were created with groundbreaking computer-generated imagery by Industrial Light & Magic and with life-sized animatronic dinosaurs built by Stan Winston's team. To showcase the film's sound design, which included a mixture of various animal noises for the dinosaur roars, Spielberg invested {{in the creation of}} DTS, a company specializing in digital surround sound formats.|$|E

5|$|Berrios' boss at the Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals, Harry H. Semrow, died November 23, 1987 at age 72. In {{accordance}} with state law, the Chief Judge of the Cook County Circuit Court appointed a temporary replacement, attorney Thomas A. Jaconetty, 34, a deputy assessor with the Board of (Tax) Appeals since 1981. Jaconnetty was a 31st ward resident {{and the secretary}} of Berrios' 31st ward Democratic organization with whom Berrios had been a precinct captain in the 31st Ward under Alderman Keane. Berrios ran for the vacancy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> the Democratic party organization. In the Democratic primary, Berrios won the nomination with a sizable margin over Jeffrey Paul Smith, an assistant corporation counsel with the City of Chicago whose candidacy was sponsored by Quinn, by then a former Commissioner.|$|E
5|$|Curtis, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, {{rejected}} the Storrow Commission's proposal.

He later {{explained that he was}} giving them an opportunity to reconsider their actions and avoid discharges, which would have been irrevocable. The police union members responded that same day by voting 1134 to 2 in favor of a strike and scheduled it to start at evening roll call the next day. Their stated grounds omitted wages and working conditions. They said the strike's rationale was to protest the Commissioner's denial of their right to ally themselves with the AFL.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1916, amid World War I, Sharif Hussein {{launched}} the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottomans from Mecca <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> the British military. Al-Bakri joined the revolt {{and moved to the}} Hejaz where he served as a channel between al-Fatat based in Damascus and the Hashemite forces leading the uprising. When the Ottomans were defeated in 1918 and Arab and British forces reached Damascus, Faisal would soon become the King of Syria and al-Bakri served as one of his advisers. The next year al-Bakri co-founded the first legal political party in Faisal's Syria, the pan-Arabist al-Istiqlal ("Independence") which sought to unify all the former Ottoman-held Arab territories under the leadership of the Hashemites. During this period until 1920, al-Bakri {{was a member of the}} Syrian National Congress as a representative of Damascus.|$|E

5|$|Once again, Gephart {{appeared}} on the scene to save the furnace. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> Philadelphia and New York investors, he formed the Nittany Iron Company, which bought and rehabilitated the furnace, returning it to blast on June 5, 1902, under Frank H. Clemson (former chief of mining at Gephart's Bellefonte Furnace Company). Other organizers included Lorenzo Terbal Munson, Gephart's brother-in-law (who was associated with Bellefonte Glass and the Bellefonte Iron and Nail Works), Archer Brown, and William Sampson. However, prosperity did not return to the ironmaking business. The furnace was idle for two months in 1904. As steel production in open hearth furnaces became increasingly commonplace (a method better suited for iron made from Lake Superior ore, while Bessemer converters functioned best with Centre County ore), Nittany Furnace found it increasingly difficult to operate at a profit. The death of Gephart on February 14, 1905 also dealt a blow to the company, which thereafter shared management with the Bellefonte Furnace Company.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Mail Case or R v Kylsant & Otrs was a noted English {{criminal}} case in 1931. The {{director of the}} Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, Lord Kylsant, had falsified a trading prospectus {{with the aid of}} the company accountant to make it look as if the company was profitable and to entice potential investors. Following an independent audit instigated by HM Treasury, Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor, were arrested and charged with falsifying both the trading prospectus and company records and accounts. Although they were acquitted of falsifying records and accounts, Kylsant was found guilty of falsifying the trading prospectus and sentenced to twelve months in prison. The company was then liquidated, and reconstituted as The Royal Mail Lines Ltd <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> the British government.|$|E
