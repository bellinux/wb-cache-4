5|$|Final Fantasy VI {{takes place}} on a large, unnamed world. During {{the course of the}} game, its {{geography}} and landscape change due to various developments in the game's plot. During {{the first half of the}} game, the world is divided into three major continents and referred to as the World of Balance. The northern continent is punctuated by a series of mountain ranges and contains many of the locations accessible to the player. Most of the southern continent has been taken over by the Empire, while the eastern continent is home to a large patch of land called the Veldt where monsters from all over the <b>world</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found. Halfway through the game, the world's geographical layout is altered, resulting in its three large continents splitting into several islands of various size situated around a larger continent at their center. This altered layout of the game's locations is referred to as the World of Ruin.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, the {{practice}} was most prevalent from the medieval era until the outbreak of World War I, but evidence of intermarriage between royal dynasties {{in other parts of}} the <b>world</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found as far back as the Late Bronze Age. Monarchs were often in pursuit of national and international aggrandisement on behalf of themselves and their dynasties, thus bonds of kinship tended to promote or restrain aggression. Marriage between dynasties could serve to initiate, reinforce or guarantee peace between nations. Alternatively, kinship by marriage could secure an alliance between two dynasties which sought to reduce the sense of threat from or to initiate aggression against the realm of a third dynasty. It could also enhance the prospect of territorial acquisition for a dynasty by procuring legal claim to a foreign throne, or portions of its realm (e.g., colonies), through inheritance from an heiress whenever a monarch failed to leave an undisputed male heir.|$|E
5|$|The Last of Us Remastered changes {{little from}} the basic {{gameplay}} {{of the original}} version. As such, it is an action-adventure survival horror game that uses a third-person perspective. The game involves gunfights, melee combat and a cover system. For most of the game, players control Joel; Ellie and other companions are controlled by the artificial intelligence. Remastered uses the DualShock 4's touchpad to navigate inventory items, and the light bar signals health, scaling from blue to orange and red when taking damage. In addition, audio recordings found in the game <b>world</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> heard through the controller's speaker; the original version forced players to remain in a menu while the recordings were played. The game's Photo Mode allows players to capture images of the game by pausing gameplay and adjusting the camera freely. In the menu, players {{have the ability to}} watch all cutscenes with audio commentary featuring creative director Neil Druckmann, Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portrayed Joel and Ellie, respectively.|$|E
50|$|A sphere {{world is}} a space whose {{boundary}} is a sphere of the same dimension as the space. A star {{world is a}}ny <b>world</b> whose boundary <b>can</b> <b>be</b> mapped onto the boundary of a sphere world. Since a forest of stars is the union {{of a number of}} star <b>worlds,</b> the forest <b>can</b> <b>be</b> recursively mapped onto a single sphere world, and then navigation techniques for sphere <b>worlds</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used.|$|R

5|$|Today, due to Paris's {{cosmopolitan}} population, every French regional cuisine {{and almost}} every national cuisine in the <b>world</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found there; the city has more than 9,000 restaurants. The Michelin Guide has been a standard guide to French restaurants since 1900, awarding its highest award, three stars, to the best restaurants in France. In 2015, of the 29 Michelin three-star restaurants in France, nine are located in Paris. These include both restaurants which serve classical French cuisine, such as L'Ambroisie in the Place des Vosges, and those which serve non-traditional menus, such as L'Astrance, which combines French and Asian cuisines. Several of France's most famous chefs, including Pierre Gagnaire, Alain Ducasse, Yannick Alléno and Alain Passard, have three-star restaurants in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Monism is the {{position}} that mind and body are not ontologically distinct entities (independent substances). This view was first advocated in Western philosophy by Parmenides in the 5th century BC and was later espoused by the 17th century rationalist Baruch Spinoza. Physicalists argue that only entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that mental processes will eventually be {{explained in terms of}} these entities as physical theory continues to evolve. Physicalists maintain various positions on the prospects of reducing mental properties to physical properties (many of whom adopt compatible forms of property dualism), and the ontological status of such mental properties remains unclear. Idealists maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind. Neutral monists such as Ernst Mach and William James argue that events in the <b>world</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> thought of as either mental (psychological) or physical depending on the network of relationships into which they enter, and dual-aspect monists such as Spinoza adhere to {{the position}} that there is some other, neutral substance, and that both matter and mind are properties of this unknown substance. The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include behaviorism, the type identity theory, anomalous monism and functionalism.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the <b>world</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E
50|$|Lava <b>worlds</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen {{occasionally}} in science fiction. In Star Wars, one such planet is Mustafar, with its heat caused by tidal forces from nearby gas giants. Mustafar scenes {{take place in}} Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith.|$|R
40|$|Combinatorial <b>worlds</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{used to give}} {{an account}} of {{necessity}} and possibility. Both accessibility and similarity between <b>worlds</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> defined. In this paper, we claim that combinatorial <b>worlds</b> <b>can</b> form a knowledge representation framework, and provide an interesting approach to nonmonotonic reasoning and belief revision. We investigate such aspects of the combinatorial worlds framework as computing concept lattices of worlds, entailment relation between concepts, accessibility between worlds and concept lattice inclusion, models of concepts and a corresponding notion of logical implication, and model-based belief revisions. Finally, we consider an example of nonmonotonic reasoning involving the notions of accessibility and similarity between worlds and systems of similarity spheres. 1.

25|$|The {{history of}} urban {{planning}} dates {{to some of}} the earliest known cities, especially in the Indus Valley and Mesoamerican civilizations, which built their cities on grids and apparently zoned different areas for different purposes. The effects of planning, ubiquitous in today's <b>world,</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen most clearly in the layout of planned communities, fully designed prior to construction, often with consideration for interlocking physical, economic, and cultural systems.|$|E
25|$|The virtual <b>world</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{accessed}} freely via Linden Lab's own client {{programs or}} via alternative Third Party Viewers. Second Life users (also called residents) create virtual representations of themselves, called avatars, {{and are able}} to interact with places, objects, and other avatars. They can explore the world (known as the grid), meet other residents, socialize, participate in both individual and group activities, build, create, shop and trade virtual property and services with one another.|$|E
25|$|According to Li, {{everything}} {{he has ever}} wanted to tell the <b>world</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found in three of his films: the message of Hero is that the suffering of one person can never be as significant as the suffering of a nation; Unleashed shows that violence is never a solution; and Fearless tells that the biggest enemy of a person is himself. Li thinks that the greatest weapon is a smile and the largest power is love.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to reconcile the intuitive evidence that conscious decisions are causally effective with {{the view that the}} physical <b>world</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> explained to operate perfectly by physical law. The conflict between intuitively felt freedom and natural law arises when either causal closure or physical determinism (nomological determinism) is asserted. With causal closure, no physical event has a cause outside the physical domain, and with physical determinism, the future is determined entirely by preceding events (cause and effect).|$|E
25|$|Further, it is {{superfluous}} {{to suppose}} that what can {{be accounted for by}} a few principles has been produced by many. But it seems that everything we see in the <b>world</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore {{there is no need to}} suppose God's existence.|$|E
25|$|Neutral monists {{adhere to}} the {{position}} that perceived things in the <b>world</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> regarded as either physical or mental depending on whether one is interested in their relationship to other {{things in the world}} or their relationship to the perceiver. For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on the wall and the pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.|$|E

25|$|Domes {{have been}} found from early Mesopotamia, which may explain the form's spread. They are found in Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, and Chinese {{architecture}} in the Ancient world, as well as {{among a number of}} contemporary indigenous building traditions. Dome structures were popular in Byzantine and medieval Islamic architecture, and there are numerous examples from Western Europe in the Middle Ages. The Renaissance architectural style spread from Italy in the Early modern period. Advancements in mathematics, materials, and production techniques since that time resulted in new dome types. The domes of the modern <b>world</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found over religious buildings, legislative chambers, sports stadiums, and a variety of functional structures.|$|E
25|$|Although the Saudi {{involvement}} in Sunni mosques around the <b>world</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{traced back to}} the 1960s, it was not until later in the 20th century that the government of Saudi Arabia became a large influence in foreign Sunni mosques. Beginning in the 1980s, the Saudi Arabian government began to finance the construction of Sunni mosques in countries around the world. An estimated US$45 billion has been spent by the Saudi Arabian government financing mosques and Sunni Islamic schools in foreign countries. Ain al-Yaqeen, a Saudi newspaper, reported in 2002 that Saudi funds may have contributed to building as many as 1,500 mosques and 2,000 other Islamic centers.|$|E
25|$|Many {{countries}} of the <b>world</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> divided into distinct geographic regions, in each of which some physical characteristic is dominant, almost {{to the exclusion of}} others. In Finland, the same physical characteristics are common to each of the four geographic regions into which the country is divided. Regional differences in Finland lie, therefore, in subtle combinations of physical qualities. In archipelago Finland, rock and water are dominant. Coastal Finland consists of broad clay plains where agriculture plays a leading role. The interior Finnish lake district supports extensive forests. Upland Finland is covered by Arctic scrub. Finland lacks true arctic tundra but has alpine tundra on top of fells.|$|E
