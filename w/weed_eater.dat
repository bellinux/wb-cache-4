50|$|<b>Weed</b> <b>Eater</b> was {{a string}} trimmer company founded in 1971 in Houston, Texas by George C. Ballas, Sr., the {{inventor}} of the device.|$|E
50|$|Ballas {{was born}} in Houston, Texas. He {{is the son of}} Maria (Marulanda) and George Ballas, the {{inventor}} of the <b>Weed</b> <b>Eater</b> lawn-trimming device. He has three sisters, Michelle, Maria, and Lillian, and one brother, George. He has Mexican, Spanish and Greek ancestry.|$|E
40|$|Technology and {{innovation}} has allowed humans to direct and manipulate resources to create ideal landscapes in non-ideal places. This is exemplified by lush, green golf {{courses in the}} dry Arizona desert. These exotic water and energy intensive practices are pervasive throughout society. But is this model good for resource diminished areas? This study looks at BSU’s opportunity to implement landscape design techniques that will save time, water, energy consumption, and pesticide use. We consider the effects of evaporative cooling that plants, trees, and grasses have on surrounding buildings; the type of plants, shrubs, grasses, and trees which reduce the use of natural resources at BSU; carbon emission attenuation from lawn mowers, <b>weed</b> <b>eaters,</b> and blowers; effective policy and design practices that will enable success; and the achievement of aesthetic beauty coupled with intelligent design. This study concludes that BSU can reduce its environmental impact while conserving its monetary expenditure...|$|R
50|$|The {{idea for}} the <b>Weed</b> <b>Eater</b> trimmer came {{to him from the}} {{spinning}} nylon bristles of an automatic car wash. He thought that he could come up with a similar technique to protect the bark on trees that he was trimming around.|$|E
50|$|George Charles Ballas, Sr. (June 28, 1925 - June 25, 2011) was an American entrepreneur. He {{invented the}} first string trimmer, {{known as the}} <b>Weed</b> <b>Eater</b> in 1971. He {{is the father of}} ballroom dancer, Corky Ballas, and {{grandfather}} of professional dancer Mark Ballas of Dancing with the Stars.|$|E
50|$|Mark Alexander Ballas Sr. (born December 25, 1960), {{known as}} Corky Ballas, {{is a retired}} {{competitive}} ballroom dancer who holds several Latin dance championship titles. His son, Mark Ballas, is a professional dancer on Dancing with the Stars. His father was George Ballas, who invented the <b>Weed</b> <b>Eater</b> lawn-trimming device.|$|E
50|$|Ballas {{was born}} in Houston, Texas, the son of dancers Corky Ballas and Shirley Ballas (née Rich). His {{paternal}} grandparents were of Mexican, Spanish, and Greek background, and his mother is originally from the United Kingdom and is of English heritage. His paternal grandfather, George Ballas, was {{the inventor of the}} <b>Weed</b> <b>Eater</b> lawn-trimming device.|$|E
50|$|Gasoline-engine powered {{trimmers}} {{usually have}} a minimum of 21 cc displacement motors. At this size they can easily turn 2 mm line and some have nylon blades as accessories to the line-reel. A 32 cc engine can swing a 2.75 mm line and often has metal-blade accessories. Most trimmers use two stroke engines and require gasoline mixed with oil. Due to pollution laws four stroke engines are becoming more popular {{with a number of}} commercial <b>weed</b> <b>eater</b> models now being powered by four stroke engines. For instance, Honda, MTD and Craftsman manufacture a four stroke engine trimmer. Other companies, such as John Deere, now carry low-emission two-stroke engine trimmers. Stihl manufactures a hybrid four stroke engine trimmer using a technology called 4MIX. 4MIX trimmers have no oil reservoir. This engine is lubricated using pre-mixed gasoline, like a two-stroke engine.|$|E
