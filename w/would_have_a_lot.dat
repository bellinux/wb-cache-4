In 2006, German-based Yager Development pitched a cover-based shooter to publisher 2K Games, who rejected the original concept of futuristic soldiers without Dubai as a setting. However, 2K offered {{them a chance}} to develop a reboot for the Spec Ops series, promising that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of creative freedom. Development began in early 2007, with most other fundamentals of the initial game intact. While the game is an installment in the Spec Ops series, the team chose to use new ideas and intentionally avoided using existing elements of the franchise.|$|E
5|$|The story {{depicts a}} young student named Shuichi Nitori, {{described}} by the author as a transgender girl, and Shuichi's friend Yoshino Takatsuki, described as a transgender boy. The series deals with issues such as being transgender, gender identity, {{and the beginning of}} puberty. Shimura was originally going to write the story about a girl in high school {{who wants to be a}} boy, but she realized that a boy who wants to be a girl before entering into puberty <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of worries related to growing up, and changed the story to fit this model. Wandering Son was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the tenth Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006. The series has been lauded for its use of gender reversal as the core of the story, though the emotional realism of the young characters has been called into question.|$|E
500|$|Havers {{returned}} to Coronation Street on 17 February 2012. While appearing on Loose Women the previous year, Havers {{revealed that he}} had been in talks with Coronation Street producers about a return to the show. He stated that he had adored his role as Lewis and that he had to return and apologise to Audrey. Later that year, ITV announced that Havers would return to Coronation Street in 2012 to reprise his role as Lewis. Series producer Phil Collinson said that Havers had started filming his scenes in January 2012 and he would return on-screen from February. Collinson also said that Lewis <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of ground to cover to win Audrey back, that the character is [...] "a great hoot" [...] and that it was wonderful to have Havers back. Peter Dyke and Katie Begley of the Daily Star wrote that [...] Lewis' return storyline would show Audrey and her daughter, Gail Platt (Helen Worth), unexpectedly meeting Lewis at a country pub. Havers told Allison Jones of Inside Soap that Lewis then tries to convince them he is his own twin brother, Hugh. Havers said, [...] "Audrey is totally floored to see him again— as you can imagine. And if I said that Gail is angry when they bump into Lewis, it would be a massive understatement!" [...] Lewis begs Audrey and Gail not to call the police and he decides to return to Weatherfield.|$|E

2500|$|Before the album's release, band leader Tuomas Holopainen {{said in an}} {{interview}} that the album <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> in common with the previous album Once. For example, the band have kept the new kind of heavier songs, such as [...] "Master Passion Greed", [...] "Whoever Brings the Night", [...] "7 Days to the Wolves", and [...] "Bye Bye Beautiful", but additionally there are softer ballads, such as [...] "Meadows of Heaven", [...] "Eva", and [...] "The Islander". This album includes lots of guest musicians and orchestral parts, just like Once, but with a bigger level.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tour manager}} was Freddie Brown, the rugged ex-Northamptonshire and England captain. He {{had led the}} 1950-51 touring side, which had been {{dismissed}} as the weakest ever sent to Australia, and his refusal to accept defeat {{in the face of}} great odds had won him admiration from the Australian public. He had played his last Test in 1953 when England regained The Ashes after 19 years, when he was the only man in the team to have toured with Douglas Jardine in 1932-33 when England had last beaten Australia. Brown had a more robust and combative style than May and wanted to complain officially about what the English party perceived as the throwing actions of the Australian bowlers, which might have resulted in a Bodyline type crisis. May refused, and Brown's unofficial complaints were rebuffed by Sir Donald Bradman. Fred Trueman thought [...] "he was a snob, bad-mannered, ignorant and a bigot" [...] Brown did not like Trueman either and threatened to send the Yorkshire fast bowler home, but May smoothed things over. The assistant-manager was Desmond Eagar, the captain of Hampshire in 1946-57, who built up the attacking team that would win the County Championship in 1961 and was a noted cricket historian. Like Brown, George Duckworth had toured with Jardine, and was now the scorer, baggage-master and general factotum. The physiotherapist or masseur was Desmond Montague, an experienced professional who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of work to do on the tour.|$|E

The boys had a big tent set up on a framework of wood, an open shed which they used as a kitchen, and a big corral. The site was up on a gradual slope, somewhat above the town, and rendered attractive by a small brook and straggling cedars. They had a Mexican cook who was known everywhere as Lying Juan.

Reilly {{created the}} character, Davidson was {{the driving force}} behind the character’s personality. “Susan was {{supposed}} to be insecure from a small town, not very worldly, basically kind of ignorant. She had an innocence. I based a lot of it on innocence, not necessarily ignorance. But she was very intelligent in a certain way. She was good at getting what she wanted.” Davidson <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of input into all of the characters she portrayed, including wardrobe and hairstyles. Reilly added Susan's obsession with Elvis Presley.|$|E
