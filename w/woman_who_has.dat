5|$|The Vicar of Bullhampton is an 1870 {{novel by}} Anthony Trollope. It {{is made up}} of three intertwining subplots: the {{courtship}} of a young woman by two suitors; a feud between the titular Broad church vicar and a Low church nobleman, abetted by a Methodist minister; and the vicar's attempt to rehabilitate a young <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> gone astray.|$|E
5|$|A <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> {{elevated}} {{blood lead}} levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk}} of a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E
5|$|Dustin Lance Black's Virginia premiered on September 15, 2010, at the Toronto International Film Festival. Two years later, it was {{announced}} that the movie would receive a limited theatrical release in May 2012. Connelly portrayed the title role of Virginia, a mentally unstable <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> a 20-year affair with the local sheriff, whose daughter then starts a relationship with Virginia's son. Connelly prepared for the role by watching documentaries on schizophrenia. She also spent time at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the New York University's Cancer Center to understand the afflections and obstacles of her character. While she was preparing for the role, director Dustin Lance Black requested Connelly's advice to design the set of Virginia's house, as well as the selection of the apparel to create the character's style.|$|E

40|$|Background: Millions of {{patients}} are prescribed drugs for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) {{in developing countries}} each year, yet the treatment effect of these prescriptions is largely unknown. Objectives: To determine if the prescribing of erythromycin and ceftriaxone to pregnant women with STI symptoms leads {{to a reduction in}} the prevalence among these women of chlamydia and gonorrhoea, respectively. Methods: We compared the prevalence of chlamydia among 116 pregnant <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been prescribed erythromycin for a history of STI symptoms in their current pregnancy with the prevalence in a control group of 557 pregnant <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been prescribed this drug. Similarly we compared the prevalence of gonorrhoea among 110 pregnant <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> and 561 <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been prescribed ceftriaxone. Results: There {{was no significant difference in}} the prevalence of chlamydia among the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> and the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not been prescribed erythromycin four times daily for 10 days (7 % v 8 %). Contrarily, none of the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been prescribed a single dose of ceftriaxone had gonorrhoea, whereas 4 % of the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not had this drug prescribed did have gonorrhoea.

5|$|There are {{texts in}} which Isis travels {{in the wider}} world. She moves among {{ordinary}} humans who are unaware of her identity, and she even appeals to these people for help. This is another unusual circumstance, for in Egyptian myth, gods and humans are normally separate. As {{in the first phase}} of the myth, she often has the aid of other deities, who protect her son in her absence. According to one magical spell, seven minor scorpion deities travel with and guard Isis as she seeks help for Horus. They even take revenge on a wealthy <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> refused to help Isis by stinging the woman's son, making it necessary for Isis to heal the blameless child. This story conveys a moral message that the poor can be more virtuous than the wealthy and illustrates Isis's fair and compassionate nature.|$|E
40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} shown there has been {{significant}} {{lack of knowledge about}} <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> cross infect each other with STIs. It has been less likely that <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> visit health care than heterosexuals, they often felt badly treated, invisible and did not always know where to turn in case of an STI. Objective: The objective was to examine if STI information from Kalmar and Växjö county websites and GCK-summit, targeted <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women.</b> Method: With a queer theoretical perspective a critical discourse analysis was made by STI information on the internet. Results: <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> have been excluded in the STI information currently available through Kalmar and Växjö county websites. The public notices for screening tests have not been designed in such way it includes <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women.</b> <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sex with <b>women</b> have been an obscure group.

Her husband covers her with a white sheet as a priest prays. Madonna, wearing a long, black coat, sings the song underneath a snow-covered, dead tree, as the young girl plays with her dead mother's jewelry. The husband comes and shouts at the girl, tearing away the woman's pearl necklace which drop at the little girl's feet. The adult Madonna is shown lying beside another man singing the song as the little girl visits her mother's grave. The man gets up and slaps Madonna in the face, as the little girl cries in front of the grave. She is taken away from the graveyard by her father, as interspersed scenes show the girl being kissed by her mother, her trying to reach the knob of a door, and Madonna powdering the bruise mark on her face.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a fantasy version of feudal Japan, and follows a rōnin named Shiren and his companion, the talking weasel Koppa, on a quest for the Land of the Golden Condor. They travel through forests, towns, {{mountains}} and caves, and are joined by three people they meet during the journey: Kechi the Masseur, a man who pretends to be blind; Oryu the Blinder, a travelling <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> the power to blind people and monsters; and Pekeji, a man who claims to be Shiren's brother, separated at birth. Shiren eventually reaches the land, where he frees the golden condor from an ancient insect-like creature. He and Koppa ride away on the condor, flying across the towns he had passed, and the townspeople look up at the condor and make a wish. The condor lands, letting Shiren and Koppa jump off, before flying away. The game ends with Shiren and Koppa walking away into the night.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in the pre-dawn hours as the young Nick Adams, his father, his uncle and their Indian guides row across a lake to a nearby Indian camp. Nick's father, a doctor, has been called out to deliver a baby for a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> been in labor for days. At the camp, they find the woman in a cabin lying on a bottom bunkbed; her husband lies above her with an injured foot. Nick's father is forced to perform a {{caesarian}} operation on the woman with a jack-knife because the baby is in the breech position; he asks Nick to assist by holding a basin. The woman screams throughout the operation, and when Nick's uncle tries to hold her down, she bites him. After the baby is delivered, Nick's father turns to the woman's husband on the top bunk and finds that he fatally slit his throat with a straight razor during the operation. Nick is sent out of the cabin, and his uncle leaves with two Natives, not to return. The story ends with only Nick and his father on the lake, rowing away from the camp. Nick asks his father questions about birth and death, and thinks to himself that he will never die, as he watches his father row.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} done to compare risk factors for HIV/STDs in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> {{reported}} <b>having</b> had sex with both men and <b>women</b> and <b>women</b> <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> had sex with men only. METHODS: Female participants in a multisite, randomized HIV/STD prevention study in the Seattle area reported both having {{had sex with a}} man in the 3 months before and having at least 1 risk factor for HIV/STDs during the year before the study. Of these <b>women,</b> 38 % <b>who</b> reported ever <b>having</b> had sex with a woman were compared with those <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> had sex with men only. RESULTS: <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with both men and women were more likely than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with men only to report drug use in the 3 months before the study, a greater lifetime number of male partners, a sex partner <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with a prostitute, an earlier age at sexual debut, and forced sexual contact (P <. 01 for all comparisons). <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with both men and women had a mean of 3. 2 of these 5 risk factors, vs 2. 1 among <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with men only (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with both men and women were more likely than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had sex with men only to engage in multiple risk behaviors. Health workers should be aware of bisexual experience among women, since this may be a marker for multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STDs...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> had preeclampsia {{demonstrate}} higher {{prevalence of}} metabolic syndrome (MetS), impaired vascular function, and increased sympathetic activity and are {{at increased risk}} of cardiovascular disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of 12 weeks of exercise training (70 - 80 % maximum volume of oxygen utilization) in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia on physical fitness, components of MetS, vasculature, and autonomic functions compared with healthy control subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Our prospective case-control study included 24 normotensive <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia and 20 control subjects who were matched for age and postpartum interval (all 6 - 12 months after delivery). Before and after training, we measured all components of MetS (ie, BP, lipids, glucose/insulin, and albuminuria), carotid intima media thickness (IMT) and brachial and superficial femoral artery endothelial function that used flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Autonomic activity was quantified with power spectral analysis (low-frequency/high-frequency power [LF/HF] ratio). RESULTS: At baseline, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia demonstrated higher values of most components of MetS. Compared with the control subjects, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia had increased IMT (580 +/- 92 mum vs 477 +/- 65 mum, respectively), impaired endothelial function (FMD brachial artery, 5. 3 % +/- 2. 2 % vs 10. 8 % +/- 3. 5 %, respectively; FMD superficial femoral artery, 4. 9 % +/- 2. 1 % vs 8. 7 % +/- 3. 2 %, respectively) and increased LF/HF power ratio (2. 2 +/- 1. 0 vs 1. 3 +/- 0. 4, respectively; all P <. 05). In both groups, exercise training decreased values of most components of MetS and IMT, improved FMD, and concurrently reduced LF/HF. Despite these improvements, vascular and autonomic variables did not normalize by 12 weeks of training in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that exercise training in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia and control subjects improves components of MetS, endothelial function, vascular wall thickness, and autonomic control. Nonetheless, trained <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had preeclampsia only reached a cardiovascular status that is comparable with sedentary healthy control subjects...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> had abortions report different levels of well-being than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not had abortions, and to examine the possible moderating effect of perceived status of the fetus. We hypothesized that <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> abortion(s) and <b>who</b> believe the fetus is human will have a more difficult postabortion adjustment than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> believe the fetus is less than human. We also hypothesized that <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> had abortions would consider maternal-related facets of their self-concepts less important than would <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not had abortions in order to preserve their self-esteem. Subjects were obtained through physician's offices and were categorized into three pregnancy history groups: the Abortion Group (N= 132), the Never Pregnant Group (N= 209), and the Other Outcomes Group (N= 476). The scales used to measure well-being were: The Satisfaction with Life Scale, Rosenberg?s Self-Esteem Scale, The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and a scale measuring 12 specific facets of the self-concept The Beliefs About the Fetus Scale, devised by the authors, measured the women's perceived status of the fetus. It was found that women in the Abortion group reported slightly lower well-being than women in the Other Outcomes Group. It was also found that <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> abortions and <b>who</b> tended to believe the fetus was human scored lower on measures of well-being than the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> tended to believe the fetus was not human, whereas the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> did not believe the fetus was human were no different on the well-being measures than the other two groups.

40|$|Using {{data from}} the 2009 General Social Survey on victimization, this study {{examines}} the relationship between Canadian women’s past experiences of sexual and physical victimization within {{the past five years}} and their subsequent engagement in self-protective behaviour. Self-protective behaviour is divided into three categories, including self-defense class enrollment, weapon carrying and overall protection (combines self-defense class and weapons). Three hypotheses are examined. Firstly, this study looks at whether <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been victimized (regardless of type) are more likely to practice self-protective behaviour than their non-victim counterparts. Then, within the victims-only group, this study looks at whether <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been sexually victimized are {{more likely to engage in}} self-protective behaviour than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> experienced physical victimization, or whether the impact of physical and sexual victimization are similar. Results indicate a strong positive relationship between past experiences of victimization and engaging in self-protection. <b>Women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been victimized are more likely to enroll in a self-defense class, carry a weapon and engage in overall protection in comparison to <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not been victimized. Furthermore, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> experienced sexual victimization are more likely to engage in overall protection than <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> experienced physical victimization. When self-defense class enrollment and weapon carrying are analyzed separately however, the impact of physical and sexual victimization is not statistically different when the control variables are included.
