5|$|Although Dean {{was still}} a {{hurricane}} and was expected to re-strengthen slightly before making its second landfall, {{the fact that it}} had weakened caused some residents to let down their guard.

5|$|He is {{credited}} with popularising a technical innovation in the printing of illustrations using wood. He adopted metal-engraving tools to cut hard boxwood across the grain, producing printing blocks that could be integrated with metal type, but <b>were</b> <b>much</b> more durable than traditional woodcuts. The result was high-quality illustration at a low price.|$|E
5|$|In a 2017 paper, Gwee {{and colleagues}} found that boobook populations on larger mountainous islands were more {{distinct}} from Australian stock, while those on flatter smaller islands <b>were</b> <b>much</b> more similar, suggesting that these locations were colonised much more recently after previous populations had become extinct.|$|E

60|$|Ibid.

5|$|Offices {{and classes}} of Harvard University closed {{only for the}} third time in the 20th century, the {{previous}} cases being the New England Hurricane of 1938 and the Blizzard of '78. Although Gloria's winds downed numerous trees and caused tens of thousands in damage in the area, overall effects <b>were</b> <b>much</b> less than expected.|$|E
5|$|Once more {{in nearly}} a two to one margin, the gay rights {{ordinance}} was defeated in Eugene. A poll taken after the vote showed that liberal voters who were not gay simply declined {{to show up and}} vote, and those who opposed the ordinance <b>were</b> <b>much</b> more motivated.|$|E

The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>much</b> brighter yellow and all transverse lines are more distinct. Females are also similar to Cotana lunulata, but <b>are</b> <b>much</b> darker and the white patch in the basal one-third of the forewings is reduced to a small dot.

5|$|Stevens never married, {{though there}} were rumors about his 20-year {{relationship}} (1848–1868) with his widowed housekeeper, Lydia Hamilton Smith (1813–1884). She was a light-skinned African-American; her husband Jacob {{and at least one}} of her sons <b>were</b> <b>much</b> darker than she was.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Union of Postal Workers {{objected to}} the {{automated}} sorting system mainly because the wages of those who ran the new automated machines <b>were</b> <b>much</b> lower {{than those who had}} hand-sorted mail.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} the first of three {{separate}} major land offensives by the Japanese in the Guadalcanal campaign. The Japanese realized after Tenaru that Allied forces on Guadalcanal <b>were</b> <b>much</b> greater in number than originally estimated and sent larger forces to the island for their subsequent attempts to retake Henderson Field.|$|E

5|$|The initial French {{attack was}} aimed at seizing the three Russian {{positions}} collectively known as the Bagration flèches, four arrow-head shaped, open-backed earthworks which arced out to the left en échelon {{in front of the}} Kolocha stream. These positions helped support the Russian left, which had no terrain advantages. There was much to be desired {{in the construction of the}} flèches, one officer noting that the ditches <b>were</b> <b>much</b> too shallow, the embrasures open to the ground, making them easy to enter, and that they <b>were</b> <b>much</b> too wide exposing infantry inside them. The flèches were supported by artillery from the village of Semyanovskaya, whose elevation dominated the other side of the Kolocha.|$|E
5|$|The latter {{three were}} {{canceled}} {{before reaching the}} market. By 1997, {{it was apparent that}} the IA-64 architecture and the compiler <b>were</b> <b>much</b> more difficult to implement than originally thought, and the delivery timeframe of Merced began slipping.|$|E
5|$|The table {{shows that}} the pay {{differentials}} enyjoyed by the senior officers of a 4th-century regiment <b>were</b> <b>much</b> smaller than those of their 2nd-century counterparts, a position {{in line with the}} smaller remuneration enjoyed by 4th-century high administrative officials.|$|E

5|$|After {{four years}} in Washington, he spent four years as Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), the number two position, at Embassy Moscow. These years {{cemented}} his reputation within the State Department as a Soviet expert. In early 1976, the State Department made public {{the fact that the}} Soviet Union had been beaming microwaves at the Moscow Embassy from a nearby building for many years. This caused concern about possible health effects of the low-level microwave radiation. Ironically, it was Soviet research that documented the psychological symptoms of sensitivity to microwave exposure. In the United States, the standards for safe exposure to microwaves <b>were</b> <b>much</b> more lenient than in the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|After the Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Screen Writers Guild {{set up on}} December 8, 1941, the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, a body to {{organize}} writers for the war effort. Rossen served as the body's chairman until 1944 and advocated {{the opening of a}} Second Front to support West European resistance against the Nazis. His earnings <b>were</b> <b>much</b> greater than in 1937. However, his work for Hollywood Writers Mobilization and for the Communist Party forced him to abandon some partly developed film projects, including The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which John Huston eventually directed in 1948.|$|E
5|$|An {{experiment}} by the Australian zoologist A.D. Blest {{demonstrated that}} the more an eyespot resembled a real vertebrate eye in both colour and pattern, the more effective it was in scaring off insectivorous birds. In another experiment using peacock butterflies, Blest showed that when the conspicuous eyespots had been rubbed off, insectivorous birds (yellow buntings) <b>were</b> <b>much</b> less effectively frightened off, and therefore both the sudden appearance of colour, and the actual eyespot pattern, contribute {{to the effectiveness of}} the deimatic display.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 35% of {{echinoderm}} genera became extinct at the K–Pg boundary, although taxa that {{thrived in}} low-latitude, shallow-water environments {{during the late}} Cretaceous had the highest extinction rate. Mid-latitude, deep-water echinoderms <b>were</b> <b>much</b> less affected at the K–Pg boundary. The pattern of extinction points to habitat loss, specifically the drowning of carbonate platforms, the shallow-water reefs in existence at that time, by the extinction event.|$|E
5|$|As The Pied Pipers, {{they worked}} on local radio and movie soundtracks. When Alyce and Yvonne King threw a party for their boyfriends' visit to Los Angeles, the group was invited to perform.

Weston said the group's vocals were unique for its time and that their vocal arrangements <b>were</b> <b>much</b> like those for orchestral instruments.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1973, several {{spacecraft}} {{have performed}} planetary flyby maneuvers {{that brought them}} within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet <b>were</b> <b>much</b> stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter {{and the amount of}} polar flattening.|$|E
50|$|Motorcycles <b>are</b> <b>much</b> less {{protected}} than cars, so any {{accident that}} might occur would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> worse, especially since frequent interchanges with complex traffic flows increase the dangers to motorcyclists.|$|R
