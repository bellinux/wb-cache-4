2500|$|In {{the general}} election, Blagojevich {{defeated}} Republican Illinois Attorney General Jim Ryan. Blagojevich's campaign was helped by his well-connected father-in-law, Chicago alderman Richard Mell. Ethics scandals had plagued {{the previous administration}} of Republican George Ryan (no relation to Jim Ryan), and Blagojevich's campaign focused {{on the theme of}} [...] "ending business as usual" [...] in state government. Polls prior to the election found that many Illinois voters were confused about the names of George Ryan and Jim Ryan, a fact which Blagojevich used to his advantage. He asked, [...] "How can you replace one Ryan with another Ryan and call that change? You <b>want</b> <b>change?</b> Elect a guy named Blagojevich." [...] Blagojevich won with 52% of the vote over Jim Ryan. On election night, he said: “Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, Illinois has voted for change.” ...|$|E
2500|$|While the Clinton {{campaign}} chose {{a strategy}} that emphasized experience, Axelrod helped to craft the Obama campaign's main theme of [...] "change." [...] Axelrod criticized the Clinton campaign's positioning by saying that [...] "being the consummate Washington insider is not {{where you want to}} be in a year when people <b>want</b> <b>change...</b> initial strategic positioning was wrong and kind of played into our hands." [...] The change message played a factor in Obama's victory in the Iowa caucuses. [...] "Just over half of [...] Democratic caucus-goers said change was the No. 1 factor they were looking for in a candidate, and 51 percent of those voters chose Barack Obama," [...] said CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider. [...] "That compares to only 19 percent of 'change' caucus-goers who preferred Clinton." [...] Axelrod also believed that the Clinton campaign underestimated the importance of the caucus states. [...] "For all the talent and the money they had over there," [...] says Axelrod, [...] "they—bewilderingly—seemed to have little understanding for the caucuses and how important they would become." [...] In the 2008 primary season, Obama won a majority of the states that use the caucus format.|$|E

60|$|The Flowers, however, were {{excessively}} {{annoyed at}} their behaviour, {{and at the}} behaviour of the birds. 'It only shows,' they said, 'what a vulgarising effect this incessant rushing and flying about has. Well-bred people always stay exactly in the same place, as we do. No one ever saw us hopping {{up and down the}} walks, or galloping madly through the grass after dragon-flies. When we do <b>want</b> <b>change</b> of air, we send for the gardener, and he carries us to another bed. This is dignified, and as it should be. But birds and lizards have no sense of repose, and indeed birds have not even a permanent address. They are mere vagrants like the gipsies, and should be treated in exactly the same manner.' So they put their noses in the air, and looked very haughty, and were quite delighted when after some time they saw the little Dwarf scramble up from the grass, and make his way across the terrace to the palace.|$|E
6000|$|As a bachelor, he {{had never}} willingly left his shop (situated in that {{exclusively}} commercial region of London which is called [...] "the City") from one year's end to another. As a married man, he persisted in following the same monotonous course; with this one difference, that he now had a woman to follow it with him. [...] "Travelling by railway," [...] he explained to his wife, [...] "will make your head ache--it makes my head ache. Travelling by sea will make you sick--it makes me sick. If you <b>want</b> <b>change</b> of air, every sort of air {{is to be found}} in the City. If you admire the beauties of Nature, there is Finsbury Square with the beauties of Nature carefully selected and arranged. When we are in London, you (and I) are all right; and when we are out of London, you (and I) are all wrong." [...] As surely as the autumn holiday season set in, so surely Old Ronald resisted his wife's petition for a change of scene in that form of words. A man habitually fortified behind his own inbred obstinacy and selfishness is for the most part an irresistible power within the limits of his domestic circle. As a rule, patient Mrs. Ronald yielded; and her husband stood revealed to his neighbours in the glorious character of a married man who had his own way.|$|E
6000|$|Robert {{will have}} told you our schemes, and how {{we are going to}} work, and are to love you near for the future, I hope. You, who are wise, will approve of us, I think, for keeping on our Florentine apartment, so as to run no more risk than is {{necessary}} in making the Paris experiment. We shall let the old dear rooms, and make money by them, and keep them to fall back upon, in case we fail at Paris. 'But we'll not fail.' Well, I hope not, though I am very brittle still and susceptible to climate. Dearest Sarianna, it will do you infinite good to come over to us every now and then--you <b>want</b> <b>change,</b> absolute change of scene and air and climate, I am confident; and you never will be right till you have had it. We talk, Robert and I, of carrying you back with us to Rome next year as an English trophy. Meanwhile you will see Wiedeman, you and dear Mr. Browning. Don't expect to see a baby of Anak, that's all. Robert is always measuring him on the door, and reporting such wonderful growth (some inch a week, I think), that if you receive his reports you will cry out on beholding the child. At least, you'll say: 'How little he must have been to be no larger now.' You'll fancy he must have begun from a mustard-seed! The fact is, he is small, only full of life and joy to the brim. I am not afraid of your not loving him, nor of his not loving you. He has a loving little heart, I assure you. If anyone pricks a finger with a needle he begins to cry--he can't bear to see the least living thing hurt. And when he loves, it is well. Robert says I must finish, so here ends dearest Sarianna's ...|$|E
