5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the large gay populations in port cities like San Francisco, Chicago and New York City are in part the result of the blue discharge. The theory asserts that many gay blue-ticket veterans from smaller urban or rural areas who felt they were unable to return to their home communities because of the shame associated with their discharges relocated to larger areas <b>with</b> <b>established</b> gay subcultures or simply stayed in the city through which they were returned to the United States.|$|E

5|$|This {{surge in}} {{interest}} for Emerson's knives soon became overwhelming. Although {{he had been}} making knives full-time since 1994, Emerson was still manufacturing these knives in his home garage workshop three years later. As Emerson watched his customers' wait time expand from two years to seven, {{he realized that the}} demand for his handmade blades was far outpacing his ability to produce them. The first method to bridge this gap between supply and demand would be through factory collaborations <b>with</b> <b>established</b> cutlery companies.|$|E

5|$|After graduating Coffin {{was unable}} to find work <b>with</b> <b>established</b> {{architectural}} firms, due to widespread prejudice against a woman working in a male-dominated field. She set up her own practice in New York City in 1905, starting out by designing suburban gardens on Long Island. Her increasing fame led to larger commissions from wealthy and powerful East Coast families. By the 1920s {{she was one of the}} most sought-after landscape architects in the eastern United States. Coffin's clientele included some of the wealthiest and most famous families in the country, including the Fricks, the Vanderbilts, the Huttons, and the du Ponts.|$|E
5|$|Although Casablanca was an A-list film <b>with</b> <b>established</b> {{stars and}} first-rate writers, no one {{involved}} with its production {{expected it to}} be anything out of the ordinary. It was just one of hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood every year. Casablanca was rushed into release {{to take advantage of the}} publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.|$|E
5|$|Because it cannot compete <b>with</b> <b>established</b> plants, {{great mullein}} {{is no longer}} {{considered}} a serious agricultural weed and is easily crowded out in cultivation, except in areas where vegetation is sparse to begin with, such as Californian semi-desertic areas of the eastern Sierra Nevada. In such ecological contexts, it crowds out native herbs and grasses; its tendency to appear after forest fires also disturbs the normal ecological succession. Although not an agricultural threat, its presence can {{be very difficult to}} completely eradicate, and is especially problematic in overgrazed pastures. The species is legally listed as a noxious weed in the American state of Colorado (Class C) and Hawaii, and the Australian state of Victoria (regionally prohibited in the West Gippsland region, and regionally controlled in several others).|$|E

5|$|Henry {{was not an}} {{especially}} pious king by medieval standards. In England, he provided steady patronage to the monastic houses, but established few new monasteries and was relatively conservative in determining which he did support, favouring those <b>with</b> <b>established</b> links to his family, such as Reading Abbey. In this regard Henry's religious tastes {{appear to have been}} influenced by his mother, and indeed before his ascension a number of religious charters were issued in their joint names. Henry did found a number of religious hospitals in England and France. After the death of Becket, Henry built and endowed various monasteries in France, primarily to improve his popular image. Since travel by sea during the period was dangerous, he would also take full confession before setting sail and use auguries to determine the best time to travel. Henry's movements may also have been planned to take advantage of saints' days and other fortuitous occasions.|$|E
5|$|Here We Go Again is {{the second}} studio album by American singer Demi Lovato. It was {{released}} on July 21, 2009, through Hollywood Records. Unlike her previous album, Don't Forget (2008), Lovato did not collaborate with the Jonas Brothers, as she {{wanted to work with}} different people and give the album a personal approach. Lovato collaborated for the album <b>with</b> <b>established</b> songwriters and producers, such as E. Kidd Bogart, Gary Clark, Toby Gad, John Mayer, Jon McLaughlin, Lindy Robbins and John Fields, who produced her previous album Don't Forget. Lovato also collaborated with The Academy Is... lead singer William Beckett to write a song about a strained relationship with her father, which was originally set to appear on the album, but was later dropped. The song later appeared on her third album Unbroken (2011).|$|E
5|$|In 1959, {{longtime}} NFL commissioner Bert Bell {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} while attending an Eagles/Steelers game at Franklin Field. That same year, Dallas businessman Lamar Hunt led the formation of the rival American Football League, the fourth such league to bear that name, with war hero and former South Dakota Governor Joe Foss as its Commissioner. Unlike the earlier rival leagues, and bolstered by television exposure, the AFL posed a significant threat to NFL dominance of the professional football world. With the exception of Los Angeles and New York, the AFL avoided placing teams in markets where they directly competed <b>with</b> <b>established</b> NFL franchises. In 1960, the AFL began play with eight teams and a double round-robin schedule of fourteen games. New NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle took office the same year.|$|E

5|$|In the {{off-season}} the Blue Jackets' approach to building their team changed, {{moving from a}} team of young developing players into one <b>with</b> <b>established</b> players. The first deal General Manager Scott Howson made was the acquisition of All-Star forward Jeff Carter on June 23, 2011. The deal sent Jakub Voracek, Columbus' first-round draft choice, the eighth overall, and their third-round pick in the 2011 Draft to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for Carter. The trade received a positive response in Columbus from fans and management who felt they finally had a number one center to play alongside of their best player, Rick Nash. Next, they traded for the negotiating rights of soon to be free agent James Wisniewski. Wisniewski scored a career high 51 points during the 2010–11 season, splitting time between the New York Islanders and Montreal Canadiens. The point total was fifth-highest in the league for defenseman scoring, tying Tobias Enstrom. The Blue Jackets came to terms with Wisniewski, just an hour {{prior to the start}} of free agency, signing him to a six-year, $33 million deal.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, 2012, {{after the}} London Olympics, Solo {{released}} her autobiography Solo: A Memoir of Hope co-authored with sports columnist and commentator Ann Killion {{and published by}} Harper Collins.

She recounted her integration into the U.S. team <b>with</b> <b>established</b> players like Mia Hamm, Brandi Chastain, and Julie Foudy. Solo also revealed details of her early life. The autobiography debuted at number three on The New York Times Best Seller list in the hardcover non-fiction category—the highest ever for a book about soccer.|$|E
5|$|The Cincinnati Reds {{talked to}} St. Louis about {{acquiring}} Chamberlain in 1889, but Cincinnati balked when St. Louis asked $8,000 for him. That year, Chamberlain pitched in a career-high 53 games {{and finished with}} 32 wins; his win total was the third highest in the league. Following the 1889 season, a new major league was forming known as the Players' League. A players association known as the Brotherhood of Professional Ball Players {{had served as a}} union and bargaining agent since the mid-1880s; now the group's new league was attempting to compete <b>with</b> <b>established</b> baseball. Browns owner Chris von der Ahe was afraid that Chamberlain would jump to the Chicago team in the new league; the manager of the Browns from the previous season, Charles Comiskey, had been hired there. Von der Ahe agreed to match the $800 pay increase that Chamberlain would have gotten in Chicago.|$|E

He instead hoped to work <b>with</b> <b>established</b> actresses like Aishwarya Rai or Rani Mukherjee. However, after seeing Vidya portray the character of Lalita, he was thoroughly appreciative of her performance. Getting an opportunity to debut with big names from the industry along with a lovely character to portray made Vidya accept the role of Lalita.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression contained a somewhat well-defined low-level center of circulation, {{as well as}} convective banding. Based on Dvorak classifications, the storm was upgraded to a tropical storm at 0000 UTC on July 27; as the fourth tropical storm of the 2004 season, it was named Darby by the NHC. Darby continued to intensify, <b>with</b> <b>established</b> outflow and a well-defined banding feature. Later that day, forecasters predicted the storm to peak as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Darby was upgraded to a hurricane at 0000 UTC on July 28, at which time it began to turn towards the northwest. An eye, embedded within the deep convection, developed later in the day. Darby attained Category 2 intensity at around 1800 UTC, and it rapidly strengthened to Category 3, becoming the first Eastern Pacific major hurricane since Hurricane Kenna of the 2002 season.|$|E
5|$|Works by {{winners and}} nominees of the Campbell Award were {{collected}} in the New Voices series of anthologies, edited by George R. R.

Burstein, who was nominated in 1996 and won in 1997, have commented that the largest effect of winning or being nominated for a Campbell is not on sales but instead that it gives credibility <b>with</b> <b>established</b> authors and publishers. Criticism has been raised about the Campbell that due to the eligibility requirements it honors writers who become well-known quickly, rather than necessarily the best or most influential authors from a historical perspective.|$|E
