Peterson, <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>his</b> first flattop haircut in 1952, hired three barbers to give haircuts {{on the floor of}} his showrooms. They gave about 50 haircuts the first day, and Peterson decided to make the gimmick a weekly event. He continued offering the haircuts for two decades and as of 2002 was still giving away about ten haircuts per week.|$|E
5|$|After {{trekking}} {{across the}} desert and nearly dying of dehydration, Tintin and Haddock are rescued and taken to a French outpost, where they hear on the radio the storm sunk the Karaboudjan. They travel to a Moroccan port, {{and along the way}} are attacked by Tuareg tribesmen, defending themselves with French MAS-36 rifles. At the port, members of his old crew kidnap the Captain after he recognises their disguised Karaboudjan. Tintin meets Thomson and Thompson <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>his</b> message, and they learn that the wealthy merchant Omar ben Salaad sold the crab tins; Tintin tells Thomson and Thompson to discreetly investigate. Tintin tracks down the gang and saves the Captain, but they both become intoxicated by the fumes from wine barrels breached in a shootout with the villains. Haddock chases a gang-member from the cellar to an entrance behind a bookcase in Salaad's house. Upon sobering up, Tintin discovers a necklace of a crab with golden claws on the now-subdued owner of the wine cellar, Omar ben Salaad, and realizes that he {{is the leader of the}} drug cartel. Allan steals a boat and tries escaping, but Tintin captures him. The police arrest the gang and free the Japanese man, who introduces himself as Bunji Kuraki, a police detective who was trying to warn Tintin of the group he was up against. He had been investigating the sailor on Haddock's crew who drowned; the sailor was on the verge of bringing him opium before he was eliminated. Turning on the radio, Tintin learns that, thanks to him, the entire organisation of the Crab with the Golden Claws is behind bars.|$|E

25|$|Babe Ruth, <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>his</b> {{first hit}} as a Yankee at Shibe Park on April 14, 1920, hit a blast to deep left-center on September 9, 1921, that cleared the then-single {{bleacher}} stand, {{went across the}} street, and hit a tree over 500feet away. On May 21, 1930, Ruth hit one to right field over the 12-foot wall that landed in Opal Street, the alley behind the second row of houses, again over 500feet distant and {{said to be the}} longest ever home run hit at Shibe Park. The longest strike ever hit there is said to be Ted Williams's prodigious foul ball blast that cleared the high roof at the right field line, passed over 20th, over Opal, over Garnet, and came down on 19th Street.|$|E
25|$|The Israeli command sent {{in three}} thrusts {{consisting}} mainly of the reservist 5th Infantry Brigade {{from the town}} of Jenin to the north, as well as a company of the Nahal Brigade from the southeast and Battalion51 of the Golani Brigade from the southwest. The force of 1,000 troops also included Shayetet 13 and Duvdevan Unit special forces, the Armoured Corps, and Combat Engineers with armored bulldozer for neutralizing the roadside bombs that would line the alleys of the camp according to Military Intelligence. Anticipating the heaviest resistance in Nablus, IDF commanders sent two regular infantry brigades there, assuming they could take over the Jenin camp in 48–72 hours with just the one reservist brigade. The force's entry was delayed until April 2 due to rain. The 5th Infantry Brigade did not have any experience in close quarters combat and did not have a commander when Operation Defensive Shield started, since the last commander's service ended a few days earlier. His substitute was a reserve officer, Lieutenant Colonel Yehuda Yedidia, <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>his</b> rank after the operation began. His soldiers were not trained for urban fighting.|$|E
25|$|The Indians stated {{their first}} innings well, with Mankad and Sarwate putting on 124 {{for the first}} wicket, before the latter became the first wicket to fall for 36 scored from 84 balls, {{dismissed}} by Bill Johnston. Then the next wicket fell at 145, this time it being that of Gul Mohammad, who was caught and bowled by Bruce Dooland, for 12. Mankad and Hazare contributed a stand of 43 before Hazare was dismissed by Sid Barnes. The next ball afterward, the Indian Captain, Amarnath fell for a duck getting out lbw to Barnes, <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>his</b> second wicket. The fifth wicket to fall, at 198, was that of Mankad himself, who had contributed a 116, which created history because it was India's first test century against Australia. He was caught by Don Tallon, the wicketkeeper, off Bill Johnston's bowling for a fine 116. Then Adhikari and Phadkar put up a partnership of 62 to bring some respectability to the score before Adhikari was dismissed for 24. Overnight rain made batting difficult, and after three cheap wickets, Amarnath declared even though India were 103 runs behind. To counter the difficult conditions, Bradman sent his tailenders, Dooland, Johnson and Johnston. But when Sid Barnes fell with the score on 32, Wisden noted that Bradman might have felt worried.|$|E

25|$|On 4 March, Real Madrid {{extended}} their streak of wins in La Liga to ten games by beating Espanyol at home 5–0. Cristiano Ronaldo, Sami Khedira and Kaká all {{scored in the}} impressive win, as did Gonzalo Higuaín, who scored twice. On 10 March, Real Madrid became the first team {{in the history of}} La Liga to win ten consecutive away games after beating Real Betis 2–3 at the Estadio Benito Villamarín. The home team started well after Jorge Molina scored early, but Higuaín equalized just over ten minutes later. In the second half, Madrid took the lead with a Ronaldo goal, but Betis equalized only couple minutes later with a strike from Jefferson Montero. Ronaldo, however, scored his second of the night later on {{which turned out to be}} the winning goal and guaranteed the full three points for the whites. Real Madrid qualified to the quarter-finals of the Champions League on 14 March by beating CSKA Moscow at home by a score of 4–1, progressing 5–2 on aggregate. Ronaldo netted a brace while Higuaín and Karim Benzema both scored one in the victory, while the lone goal from CSKA was scored by Zoran Tošić. On 18 March, Real Madrid tied against Málaga at the Bernabéu 1–1 after an injury time free kick by Santi Cazorla. Real Madrid's only goal was scored by Benzema. On 21 March, Real Madrid drew again 1–1, this time against Villarreal, with Ronaldo and Marcos Senna scoring the goals. After back-to-back draws, Real Madrid was on an advantage of just six points ahead of rivals Barcelona. In the controversial game, Mourinho was expelled from the match as was fitness trainer Rui Faria for the third time in his season. The referee gave Sergio Ramos a second yellow card for a tough challenge on Nilmar and gave direct red to Özil for sarcastically applauding his decision. Pepe was also booked after the game for insulting the referee, which led to a two-game suspension for him. On 24 March, Real Madrid beat Real Sociedad 5–1, with two goals each from Ronaldo and Benzema and a single goal for Higuaín. Ronaldo averaged 1.01 goals by having 100 goals scored in La Liga that day. On the following week, on 27 March, Real Madrid continued their good form in Champions League by defeating opponent APOEL in Cyprus 0–3. Benzema scored a header from a pass from Kaká, who then scored the second one; Benzema closed the game by scoring the third goal from an Özil assist. On the last day of the month, Real Madrid beat Osasuna away, 1–5. Benzema scored a stupendous volley goal and Ronaldo equally great 36-yard long range shot at goal. It was overall Ronaldo's night, since he also scored another goal, a free kick that was deflected, and assisted two other goals. Higuaín was the third player <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>his</b> name on the scoresheet, scoring twice. His last goal was the 100th goal for Madrid in La Liga this season.|$|E

Alton then recalls about a funny guy in Korea <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>his</b> brains blown out over the Pacific and that [...] "there's nothing funny about that". Jerry (frightened) eventually goes to the bathroom, abandoning George (also frightened), who attempts to compliment Alton about his book, Fair Game. George gets uncomfortable and tells Alton {{he has to make}} a phone call. He meets Jerry in the bathroom and both mention how terrified they are because of Alton; they decide to go home if Elaine does not show up in the next ten minutes. When they return, Alton receives a message from Elaine, who will arrive in thirty minutes, which worries them both.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong {{had several}} {{students}} who were well-known scholars and linguists themselves. Indian linguist Suniti Kumar Chatterji studied at the University of London from 1919 to 1921 for his D.Litt.; while he was there, Armstrong and Ida C. Ward taught him phonetics and drilled him with ear-training and transcription exercises. John Rupert Firth, who would later work at the University College Phonetics Department himself along Armstrong, {{was a student at}} University College from 1923 to 1924; the classes he took included Armstrong's course in French Phonetics. In the summer of 1934, Scottish phonetician Ian Catford, then age 17, took a class in French phonetics taught by Armstrong and Hélène Coustenoble. Armstrong taught advanced phonetics to American linguist Lorenzo Dow Turner while he was doing postdoctoral research at the School of Oriental Studies from 1936 to 1937. French Canadian linguist , <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>his</b> masters degree studying under Armstrong in 1937 and later worked alongside her, specifically pointed out Armstrong's kindness and articulatory prowess.

2500|$|During the Northern Song {{many of the}} {{government}} officials/poets were caught up on {{one side or the}} other over the controversial reformism of the powerful government minister Wang Anshi.

Su Shi's poetry also was much affected by his second period of banishment to what was then an extremely remote imperial outpost on the far southern island of Hainan. During the Southern Song, much of the political controversy was waged around the issue of the status of the occupied northern part of the empire, which had been lost in the Jurchen invasion. Lu You was one of the poets who considered reconquering the north his patriotic duty and wrote poems in this regard.|$|E

2500|$|With {{its goal}} finally accomplished, the high class of San Juan did its part to erase Enríquez's {{presence}} from the collective memory of Puerto Rico. His {{loyalty to the}} Crown was also ignored by the same authorities that he fervently served in life and his role in history eventually faded from the records. Throughout the following centuries Enríquez's work became fragmented, with the bulk remaining obscure. Locally, authors Salvador Brau, Arturo Morales Carrión and José Luis González played a role introducing him to native literature, while his figure was established within the education system by 1922's Historia de Puerto Rico. Internationally, the early accounts of his life reflect their source, with British versions depicting him as a criminal while the Spanish ones describe his success. An example was published in 1940 by historian Jean O. McLachlan of the British Raj, who after revising the declarations of the South Sea Company's factors concluded that Enríquez [...] " [...] {{the most famous of}} the guarda costas" [...] and that he [...] "may have been a desperado". This author relays a derogatory origin story, which contends that he was an ex-slave <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>his</b> fortune by [...] "betraying a gentleman to the Inquisition" [...] and used this to become a privateer. McLachlan claims that Enríquez was [...] "given a gold medal and the title of Don [...] as a result of giving presents to the royal officials and even to His Catholic Majesty". A direct contrast is established in the eleventh volume of Historia general de España y América, a collaboration written by several professors of the University of Córdoba and the University of Seville detailing the history of Spain, which asserts that [...] " [...] all the Spanish corsairs, the most accomplished one was the Puerto Rican Miguel Henríquez", whom they describe as a [...] "famous and feared [...] mythological figure in the Caribbean" [...] during his lifetime.|$|E
