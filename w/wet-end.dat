50|$|Some {{of the key}} {{rules of}} thumb for talc are (a) {{disperse}} it well, (b) add it to those process streams that are giving the biggest problems, (c) add it early enough to the process with enough agitation, and (d) add enough. If too little talc is used, the talc is merely incorporated into deposits and agglomerates of tacky materials. It makes sense also to use an effective retention aid program in order to retain the talc (and any attached tacky materials), purging the problem from the <b>wet-end</b> system.

40|$|The {{application}} of fillers {{at the surface}} of cellulosic paper is an interesting and industrially-commercialized but not very well-known concept, in which the filler particles are essentially added to the voids of the fibrous matrixes. This so-called “surface filling” {{can be achieved by}} the use of fillers together with a polymer solution via film press or size press, an approach that is distinct from both <b>wet-end</b> filling and conventional coating of paper. As an easily practicable process, surface filling has some advantages over direct <b>wet-end</b> addition of fillers, such as minimizing the adverse effects of filler addition on paper strength. Efficient surface filling is somewhat dependent on the specific characteristics of both fillers and fibrous matrixes. Surface filling may provide interesting possibilities for the papermaking discipline; for example, it would open the door to maximizing the cost-effectiveness of paper mills, and efficiently adding new functionalities to cellulosic paper. From both practical and fundamental points of view, systematic exploration and understanding of surface filling of cellulosic paper would be of great significance to the papermaking industry...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the improvement of}} two radically different cellulose materials, paper and artificial blood vessels, constructed from two diverse cellulose sources, wood pulp and Acetobacter xylinum. The improvement of both materials was possible due to the natural affinity of the hemicellulose xyloglucan for cellulose. Chemical and mechanical pulps were treated with xyloglucan in the <b>wet-end</b> prior to hand sheet formation or by spray application of dry hand sheets, loading a comparable amount of xyloglucan. The tensile strength increases for the <b>wet-end</b> treatment and spray application were 28 % and 71 % respectively for bleached soft wood, compared to untreated sheets (20. 7 Nm/g). The corresponding strength increases for hand sheets made of thermo-mechanical pulp were 6 % and 13 % respectively compared to untreated sheets (42. 4 Nm/g). The tendency for chemical pulp to be superior to mechanical pulp with respect to strength increase was valid even for tear strength and Scott-Bond. These results suggest, in agreement with other studies, that adhesion of xyloglucan to wood fibres is dependent on their degree of surface lignification.

The polymers used in the study were polyamide epichlor-ohydrin (PAE), wet-strength resin, and an imidazolinium quaternary (IZQ) softener, which are commonly used in tissue manufacturing. With a single additive (PAE or IZQ), the concentrations were proportional to the UV absorptions at wavelengths of 314 and 400 nm, respectively. With both polymers present, the concentration were determined by multi-wavelength spectral analysis combined with a PLS calibration method. The spectro-scopic analysis data indicated that the bulk of the additives adsorbed within a few minutes. Higher additive charges led to higher level adsorption equilibria.

Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) of cellulases derived from Trichoderma viride and T. reesei, and of xylanase from Thermomyces lanuginosus, were obtained by site-directed digestion with papain, then introduced into anionic polyacrylamide (A-PAM) via a peptide condensation reaction. Three types of CBM-conjugated A-PAMs (CBM-A-PAMs) displayed different retention behavior, depending {{on the kind of}} pulp substrates, i. e. hardwood and softwood fibers. The CBM-A-PAM from T. viride demonstrated good additive retention for hardwood pulp fibers, resulting in high tensile strength of paper sheets, even under contaminated conditions in the presence of Ca 2 + ions and ligninsulfonate. The CBM-A-PAM from T. reesei showed better performance for softwood than for hardwood sheets. The xylanase CBM-A-PAM was preferentially retained on hardwood fibers in which hemicelluloses might be present.

Rendering the water-loving cellulosic paper superhydrophobic can open the door for value-added applications. Superhydrophobic paper is a fairly new area, and only very limited scientific publications are available in the literature. Among these publications, the topics on the use of mineral pigments in fabrication of superhydrophobic structures account for a large proportion. During the fabrication process, mineral pigments, e. g., silica, precipitated calcium carbonate, and clay, generally need to be hydrophobized, either directly or indirectly. Mineral pigments can be applied to cellulosic paper by surface treatment or <b>wet-end</b> filling, and good dispersabilities of these pigments are always highly demanded. A key mechanistic point is that by tunable particle packing or fabrication, mineral pigments may exhibit surface-roughening effects, which are critical for superhydrophobicity development. The roughening of a hydrophobic surface helps to enhance hydrophobicity. Possible concepts such as nano-structuring or controllable surface patterning of mineral pigments may help to improve superhydrophobicity.

40|$|Cationic starch is {{a common}} <b>wet-end</b> {{additive}} in the paper industry which is mainly used to enhance retention and dry strength of the finished paper. At Smurfit Kappa Piteå, cationic starch {{is by far the}} most costly chemical used in the paper mill. It is therefore important that the added starch works efficiently, as poor adsorption of starch causes dissolved starch to circulate in the systems. This could cause slime deposits affecting the runnability of the paper machine and other equipment. In the planned production expansion at Smurfit Kappa Piteå during the nearest future, the demand on well-functioning <b>wet-end</b> starch will increase. Through mappings and laboratory studies, the purpose of the present project was to determine the efficiency of the current starch used in the paper mill and to identify any potential for improvements. A method to measure starch content in paper, pulp and white water was implemented to enable the above-mentioned activities to be carried out. As a tool for quality control of cooked starch, a microscopic method was implemented. The method was proven to be a simple and quick tool to verify whether the cooked starch was completely solubilized or not. Mappings at both paper machines were performed where adsorbed and dissolved starch content were analyzed according to the above-mentioned test method. The results showed the highest level of adsorption in the top ply system at PM 2 while the base ply systems at both paper machines displayed lower levels. A significant difference of conductivity in pulps as well as furnishes is likely to explain the difference in adsorption efficiency between the systems. High levels of dissolved starch were observed in the top ply system at PM 1 despite any use of cationic starch in this system. This is explained by dissolved starch in the white water that originates from other stock preparation systems is introduced via the shared dilution of pulp. A laboratory study was conducted to compare the adsorption of starches with different degree of substitution in pulp suspensions. The electrolyte concentration was adjusted to reflect the conditions in the base ply systems at PM 1 and PM 2.  Slightly higher adsorption was observed at higher levels of dosage for starch with a higher DS. Based on these values, the use of this product in the base ply systems at PM 1 and PM 2, could reduce the costs of starch through lowered dosages.

30|$|Handsheets were {{prepared}} with rosin soap size and aluminum sulfate under various conditions, and the retention {{behavior of the}} rosin size and aluminum components in the handsheets was studied. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography and X-ray fluorescence analysis {{were used to determine}} the size and aluminum contents in the handsheets, respectively. When the addition level of rosin soap size varied from 0 % to 4 % and that of aluminum sulfate was fixed at 2 %, the rosin size content increased with the increase in the size addition level, whereas aluminum and calcium contents were roughly constant. Under these conditions, handsheets prepared from fines-free pulp had aluminum contents less than those for the original beaten pulp, probably because the former pulp had a carboxyl content less than that of the latter pulp. Not only the conventional rosin retention mechanism but also mechanism proposed below must exist in the rosin soap size-alum systems. That is, some aluminum compounds originating from aluminum sulfate are adsorbed on pulp fibers immediately after the aluminum sulfate addition. These adsorbed aluminum compounds form cationic sites on pulp fibers, and free rosin acid components with anionic charges are then adsorbed onto the cationic sites of pulp fibers at the <b>wet-end.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{properties}} of the equilibrium state of polyamide-epichlorohydrin retention on fibers in a paper-making <b>wet-end</b> aqueous media were investigated using a colloid titration method. The adsorption behavior of PAE obeyed a mono-molecular layer adsorption, as characterized in Langmuir-type expression. While the ma-jority of PAE was adsorbed within a few minutes, it slowed down at longer times as the fiber surfaces become saturated. The true equilibrium of PAE adsorption could not be determined simply with experimental data, be-cause the adsorbed PAE showed dynamic behavior at near-equilibrium, such as molecular reconformation and diffusion of PAE into porous fibers after its adsorption. This phenomenon was illustrated by the charge decay characteristics of fibers with the adsorbed PAE after a rapid initial rise to a maximum zeta potential. The ad-sorption rate constants and the maximum PAE adsorptions on fiber surfaces were determined from the theoret-ical equilibrium predicted using a modified Langmuir kinetic model. The apparent Gibb’s free energy of PAE adsorption on fiber surfaces was- 14. 3 kJ/mol. The enthalpy of PAE adsorption (- 14. 7 kJ/mol) was {{of the order of}} that of molecular condensation and indicated that the PAE adsorption on the aqueous fiber suspension is po-tentially an exothermic physical process with a long-range, but weak, molecular interactions...|$|E

Starting with flax rovings of different sizes, an apparatus {{was developed to}} feed and align the rovings over the <b>wet-end</b> section of a paper machine. The short kraft paper fibers are therefore mixed with the long flax roving as the machine is running, {{and at the end}} of the process, a sheet of the hybrid dry reinforcement is obtained and cut to size for impregnation with various resins, using different processes. This novel manufacturing process allows for high volume production of reinforcement. It is very flexible, and many different combinations of long and short fibers can be exploited for the production of a vast variety of dry reinforcements. In this paper, composite samples are obtained out of these reinforcements, using the resin infusion (RI) molding process with a commercial epoxy resin. The results are compared with those of usual glass fiber reinforcement. An interesting aspect is that the large variability, typical for natural fibers, is largely reduced when the short kraft fibers are present in the composite. In terms of permeability to resin, reasonably comparable values can be obtained compared to that of glass fabrics, if a low surface density of reinforcement is chosen...|$|E
40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate the potential application of the UV spectroscopic method for determination of the polymeric additives present in papermaking fibrous stock solutions. The study also intended to establish the surface-chemical retention model associated with the adsorption kinetics of additives on fiber surfaces. Polyamide epichlorohydrin (PAE) wet strength resin and imidazolinium quaternary (IZQ) softening agents were selected to evaluate the analytical method. Concentrations of PAE and IZQ in solution were proportional to the UV absorption at 314 and 400 nm, respectively. The time-dependent behavior of polymeric additives obeyed a mono-molecular layer adsorption as characterized in Langmuir-type expression. The kinetic modeling for polymeric adsorption on fiber surfaces was based on a concept that polymeric adsorption on fiber surfaces has two distinguishable stages including initial dynamic adsorption phase and the final near-equilibrium state. The simulation model predicted not only the real-time additive adsorption behavior for polymeric additives at high accuracy once the kinetic parameters were determined, but showed a good agreement with the experimental data. The spectroscopic method examined on the PAE and IZQ adsorption study could potentially be considered as an effective tool for the <b>wet-end</b> retention control as applied to the paper industry...|$|E

In the two other processes, cell wall delamination was facilitated by pretreatments that introduced anionically charged groups into the fibre wall, by means of either a carboxymethylation reaction or irreversibly attaching carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) to the fibres. All three processes are industrially feasible and enable energy-efficient production of MFC. Using these processes, MFC can be produced with an energy consumption of 500 – 2300 kWh/tonne. These materials have been characterized in various ways and it has been demonstrated that the produced MFCs are approximately 5 – 30 nm wide and up to several microns long. The MFCs were also evaluated in a number of applications in paper. The carboxymethylated MFC was used to prepare strong free-standing barrier films and to coat wood-containing papers to improve the surface strength and reduce the linting propensity of the papers. MFC, produced with an enzymatic pretreatment, was also produced at pilot scale and was studied in a pilot-scale paper making trial as a strength agent added at the <b>wet-end</b> for highly filled papers.

40|$|Abstract: An {{economical}} {{mass production}} system of bacterial cellulose (BC) on agitated culture was constructed. We frst conducted screening of BC producers in agitated culture. A total of 2096 strains were isolated from natural sources {{and the best}} BC producing strain, BPR 2001, was selected. According to the taxonomic examination, we concluded that the strain belongs to a new subspecies, Acetobacter xylinum subsp. sucrofermentans subsp. nov. Of the several organic nitrogen sources used to supplement the culture medium, corn steep liquor (CSL) {{was found to be}} the most suitable for BC production. A mutant strain derived from BPR 2001, BPR 3001 E, resistant to an analogue of PABA, sulfaguanidine, showed increased cell growth and 40 % higher BC productivity than BPR 2001. A host-vector system for the BC producing Acetobacter strain was then developed using an indigenous plasmid, pAH 4, detected in BPR 2001. The complete nucleotide sequence of pAH 4 was determined and the shuttle vector pSA 19 was constructed by connecting pAH 4 to pUC 18. pSA 19 was found to be very stable and the system was suitable for introducihg genes into the BC producer in order to increase the yield of BC. Effective agitation culture systems essential for the BC ferementation with high yields were also developed. When the BC produced in this system was examined as a <b>wet-end</b> additive for papermaking processes, both the tensile strength and filler-retention of the resulting handsheets were found to be distinctly improved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} some novel {{mechanical and}} electronic design {{aspects of a}} high frequency Ambient Noise Imaging (ANI) system being built at the Acoustic Research Laboratory of the National University of Singapore. Modularity in construction of the array permits upgrading and servicing of the array at sensor module level. A neoprene acoustic window without any coupling medium is used on ceramic faces in place of conventional potting. This greatly simplifies the design and maintenance of the array. Test results showed that sensors with dry-coupled neoprene perform as well as ones with conventional polyurethane-based encapsulation. A hierarchical noise reduction strategy is employed in the array design to reduce performance degradation due to rear-propagating noise and structural noise transmission. The whole array has been engineered so as to keep the cabling to a minimum. Different units, called modules, of the array can be simply plugged in or taken out {{without the need for}} soldering or using interconnecting cables. The mechanical design of the array has been optimised using FEM analysis. Signal acquisition and conditioning electronics are placed well close to the sensors to give a compact module design and it provides a digital output. Another novel part of the design is the use of 54 Pentium processors networked in two loop topologies employing the Fibre Channel protocol for the <b>wet-end</b> processing. Each of the loops carries 0. 8 Gbit/S of data. Results of the sensitivity and beam pattern measurements carried out on a prototype array, a scaled down version of the main array, are also presented.
