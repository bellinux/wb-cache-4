Most of the studies in this area are large prospective studies that follow people over time, and <b>while</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a correlation between the two variables (friendship and health status), researchers still do not know if there is a cause and effect relationship, such as the notion that good friendships actually improve health. A number of theories have attempted to explain this link. These theories have included that good friends encourage their friends to lead more healthy lifestyles; that good friends encourage their friends to seek help and access services when needed; that good friends enhance their friends' coping skills in dealing with illness and other health problems; and that good friends actually affect physiological pathways that are protective of health.|$|E

25|$|The role of {{pelvic floor}} {{exercises}} and anal sphincter exercises in FI is poorly determined. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> some benefit they appear less useful than implanted sacral nerve stimulators. These exercises aim {{to increase the}} strength of the pelvic floor muscles (mainly levator ani). The anal sphincters are not technically part of the pelvic floor muscle group, but the EAS is a voluntary, striated muscle which therefore can be strengthened in a similar manner. It has not been established whether pelvic floor exercises can be distinguished from anal sphincter exercises in practice by the people doing them. This kind of exercise is more commonly used to treat urinary incontinence, for which there is a sound evidence base for effectiveness. More rarely are they used in FI. The effect of anal sphincter exercises are variously stated as an increase in the strength, speed or endurance of voluntary contraction (EAS).|$|E
25|$|In {{a process}} called microsporogenesis, four haploid microspores are {{produced}} from each diploid sporogenous cell (microsporocyte, pollen mother cell or meiocyte), after meiotic division. After {{the formation of the}} four microspores, which are contained by callose walls, the development of the pollen grain walls begins. The callose wall is broken down by an enzyme called callase and the freed pollen grains grow in size and develop their characteristic shape and form a resistant outer wall called the exine and an inner wall called the intine. The exine is what is preserved in the fossil record. Two basic types of microsporogenesis are recognised, simultaneous and successive. In simultaneous microsporogenesis meiotic steps I and II are completed prior to cytokinesis, whereas in successive microsporogenesis cytokinesis follows. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a continuum with intermediate forms, the type of microsporogenesis has systematic significance. The predominant form amongst the monocots is successive, but there are important exceptions.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} a number of criticisms of the premium support model. Some have raised concern about risk selection, where {{insurers}} find ways to avoid covering people expected to have high health care costs. Premium support proposals, such as the 2011 plan proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan (R–Wis.), have aimed to avoid risk selection by including protection language mandating that plans participating in such coverage must provide insurance to all beneficiaries and are not able to avoid covering higher risk beneficiaries. Some critics are concerned that the Medicare population, which has particularly high rates of cognitive impairment and dementia, would have a hard time choosing between competing health plans. Robert Moffit, a senior fellow of The Heritage Foundation responded to this concern, stating that <b>while</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> research indicating that individuals have difficulty making the correct choice of health care plan, there is no evidence to show that government officials can make better choices. Henry Aaron, one of the original proponents of premium supports, has recently argued that the idea should not be implemented, given that Medicare Advantage plans have not successfully contained costs more effectively than traditional Medicare and because the political climate is hostile to the kinds of regulations that would be needed to make the idea workable.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{observers}} {{conclude that}} Beck was wrongly decided. [...] The reasons for reaching this conclusion vary, however. [...] Some critics, {{in reviewing the}} Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence, have found {{that there is no}} simply no First Amendment burden imposed by an agency fee which includes charges not related to collective bargaining. Others conclude that <b>while</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> some infringement on free speech, the voluntary nature of collective bargaining does not raise it to the level of state action under existing Supreme Court doctrine. Many conclusions about state action rely {{on the fact that the}} NLRA grants unions the right to charge agency fees, thus making the union a state actor. But scholars critical of Beck point to the Court's ruling in Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., where the Supreme Court held that even a governmental grant of power is insufficient to create state action. At least one commentator has concluded that the Court's First Amendment analysis in Beck is unbalanced because it fails to take into account the associational liberties also protected by the First Amendment.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the subject}} of suicide, Hauerwas {{challenges}} the claim that autonomous suicide is morally acceptable, but also wants to distinguish himself from the position that denies rational suicide. He believes that suicide can be and often is a rational decision of an “autonomous” agent, but does {{not agree with the}} notion that it is justified. He contends that suicide as an institution must be considered morally doubtful, as the life that we are given should be considered a gift bestowed upon us by God. To many, the term [...] "rational suicide" [...] {{is based on the assumption}} that the decision to live or die depends on whether life has a meaning or purpose. Hauerwas, however, contends that the reason we should live on, is because our lives are not ours, and as such, reminds us that there is a commitment to keep on living. Yet, <b>while</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> times in our lives where suicide may seem rational, mere existence allows us to enjoy certain joys, such as helping another, or healing the sick, that should be enough to sustain our commitment to living.|$|E

2500|$|Imperfections in the Quran. Critics {{reject the}} idea that the Quran is {{miraculously}} perfect and impossible to imitate as asserted in the Quran itself. The 1901-1906 Jewish Encyclopedia, for example, writes: [...] "The language of the Koran is held by the Mohammedans to be a peerless model of perfection. Critics, however, argue that peculiarities {{can be found in the}} text. For example, critics note that a sentence in which something is said concerning Allah is sometimes followed immediately by another in which Allah is the speaker (examples of this are suras xvi. 81, xxvii. 61, xxxi. 9, and xliii. 10.) Many peculiarities in the positions of words are due to the necessities of rhyme (lxix. 31, lxxiv. 3), while the use of many rare words and new forms may be traced to the same cause (comp. especially xix. 8, 9, 11, 16)." [...] More serious are factual inaccuracies. For instance, Sura 25.53 claims that fresh water and salt water do not mix. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> cases in which these two bodies of water mix only slowly, every (fresh water) river that reaches an ocean will mix with salt water.
