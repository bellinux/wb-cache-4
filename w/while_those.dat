5|$|Although {{globular}} clusters generally appear spherical in form, ellipticities can occur due to tidal interactions. Clusters within the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are typically oblate spheroids in shape, <b>while</b> <b>those</b> in the Large Magellanic Cloud are more elliptical.|$|E

5|$|According to the genealogy, from Vukašin's sons Vukmir, Grubiša, Radoja and Radonja emerged three branches. Per settlement, Vukmir's {{descendants}} {{are known}} as Kačićs of Gradac, <b>while</b> <b>those</b> of Radonja and Grubiša are Kačićs of Brist. From the first branch emerged Jurčević, Viskić (Visko), Stipić, Pekić (Peko) and Bartolović (older Sladojević), while from the second branch came Miošić, Aleksić (Alesić), Žarković and Barišić.|$|E

5|$|Falco peregrinus japonensis, {{described}} by Gmelin in 1788, includes kleinschmidti, pleskei, and harterti, {{and seems to}} refer to intergrades with calidus. It is found from northeast Siberia to Kamchatka (though it is possibly replaced by pealei on the coast there) and Japan. Northern populations are migratory, <b>while</b> <b>those</b> of Japan are resident. It is similar to peregrinus, but the young are even darker than those of anatum.|$|E

5|$|Hawkins benefited {{greatly from}} the public's {{reaction}} to the dinosaurs, which was so strong it allowed {{for the sale of}} sets of small versions of the dinosaur models, priced at £30 for educational use. But the building of the models was costly (having cost around £13,729) and in 1855, the Crystal Palace Company cut Hawkins's funding. Several planned models were never made, <b>while</b> <b>those</b> half finished were scrapped, despite protest from sources including the Sunday newspaper, The Observer.|$|E

I-35E also carries the legislative route of I-35—unsigned legislative route 390—through the Twin Cities. On the other hand, the portion of I-35E through the West Seventh neighborhood of Saint Paul is a controversial four-lane parkway that heavy trucks are prohibited from using.|$|E
5|$|In Sydney, fear of an {{impending}} Japanese invasion caused {{people to move}} west; housing prices in the Eastern Suburbs dropped, <b>while</b> <b>those</b> beyond the Blue Mountains rose significantly.

5|$|In late 2004, the National Annenberg Election Survey at the University of Pennsylvania ran a {{study of}} American {{television}} viewers and found that fans of The Daily Show had a more accurate idea of the facts behind the 2004 presidential election than most others, including those who primarily got their news through the national network evening newscasts and through reading newspapers. However, in a 2004 campaign {{survey conducted by the}} Pew Research Center those who cited comedy shows such as The Daily Show as a source for news were among the least informed on campaign events and key aspects of the candidates' backgrounds <b>while</b> <b>those</b> who cited the Internet, National Public Radio, and news magazines were the most informed.

5|$|Many {{environmental}} {{scientists believe}} amphibians, including frogs, are good biological indicators of broader ecosystem health {{because of their}} intermediate positions in food chains, their permeable skins, and typically biphasic lives (aquatic larvae and terrestrial adults).
