5|$|The Angel of the Lord {{stated that}} Manoah's wife was {{to abstain from}} all {{alcoholic}} beverages, and her promised child was not to shave or cut his hair. He {{was to be a}} Nazirite from birth. In ancient Israel, those wanting to be especially dedicated to God for a time could take a Nazirite vow which included abstaining from wine and spirits, not cutting hair or shaving, and other requirements. The wife believed the Angel of the Lord; her husband was not present, so he prayed and asked God to send the messenger once again to teach them how to raise the boy <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> born.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The photo was intended as a message to the Emperor about <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the senior partner in their relationship.|$|E

25|$|Scully {{decided to}} leave CBS {{in favor of a}} job calling {{baseball}} games for NBC (beginning in 1983) following a dispute over assignment prominence (according to CBS Sports producer Terry O'Neil, in the book The Game Behind the Game). CBS decided going into the 1981 NFL season that John Madden, whom CBS had hired in 1979 and who had called games alongside Frank Glieber and Gary Bender his first two years, {{was going to be the}} star color commentator of their NFL television coverage. But they had trouble figuring out <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his play-by-play partner, since Scully was in a battle with CBS' lead play-by-play announcer Pat Summerall for the position. At the time Scully was the number two announcer for CBS, a position he had held since 1975, and was calling games alongside the former Kansas City Chiefs head coach Hank Stram, who had been promoted from CBS' number three broadcast team alongside Curt Gowdy.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the recording, {{numerous}} artists commented on the process, the 1985 version of the song and co-writer Michael Jackson. R singer Jordin Sparks revealed that, despite having been born after the release of the original, the song had a [...] "huge impact" [...] on her. Celine Dion said that the release of the song would not only benefit the Haitian people, but also serve as a remembrance of [...] "the passion [...] Jackson had for helping those in need". Lionel Richie and Quincy Jones echoed Dion's sentiments and further stated that if the singer were alive, he would have wanted to be just as involved as he had been {{a quarter of a century}} ago. According to Phillips, there was a [...] "handful" [...] of musicians who either declined or could not rearrange their schedules for the song's recording, including country singer Taylor Swift, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> touring in Australia.|$|E
500|$|During the interregnum the szlachta {{prepared}} {{a set of}} rules and limitations for the future monarch to obey as a safeguard to ensure that the new king, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a foreigner, complied with the peculiarities of the Commonwealth's political system and respected the privileges of the nobility. As Henry of Valois {{was the first one to}} sign the rules, they became known as the Henrician Articles. The articles also specified the wolna elekcja (free election) as the only way for any monarch's successor to assume the office, thus precluding any possibility of hereditary monarchy in the future. The Henrician Articles summarized the accumulated rights of Polish nobility, including religious freedom guarantees, and introduced further restrictions on the elective king; as if that were not enough, Henry also signed the so-called pacta conventa, through which he accepted additional specific obligations. Newly crowned Henry soon embarked on a course of action intended to free him from all the encumbrances imposed, but the outcome of this power struggle was never to be determined. One year after the election, in June 1574, upon learning of his brother's death, [...] Henry secretly left for France.|$|E

500|$|At the end {{of season}} three, House dismisses Chase, while Foreman and Cameron resign. After an episode in which he [...] "borrows" [...] a janitor whom he calls [...] "Dr. Buffer" [...] to assist in a diagnosis, House must then recruit a new {{diagnostic}} team, for which he identifies seven finalists. The producers originally planned to recruit two new full-time actors, with Foreman, who returns in season four's fifth episode, bringing the team back up to three members; ultimately, {{the decision was made}} to add three new regular cast members. (Along with Epps, actors Morrison and Spencer remained in the cast, as their characters moved on to new assignments.) During production, the show's writers dismissed a single candidate per episode; as a result, said Jacobs, neither the producers nor the cast knew <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hired until the last minute. In the season's ninth episode, House's new team is revealed: Foreman is joined by doctors Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn), Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), and Remy [...] "Thirteen" [...] Hadley (Olivia Wilde). The candidates rejected by House did not return to the show, with the exception of the last one cut: Amber Volakis (Anne Dudek), who appeared for the rest of season four as Wilson's girlfriend, and in seasons five and eight as a hallucination of House's. While Penn and Wilde had higher profiles than the actors who played the other finalists, Jacobs said they went through an identical audition process and stayed with the show based on the writers' interest in their characters. Kutner was written out of the series in episode 20 of season 5 after Penn took a position in the Obama White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{consequences}} of the meetings between Kastner and Eichmann had long-lasting repercussions in the Israeli and Hungarian Jewish communities that are still felt. Part of these repercussions revolve around the fact that Kastner helped to draw up the list of <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> among the Jews who were chosen to be saved and allowed to leave on a train. According to some sources, many of the Jews who were saved were Kastner's relatives, rich Hungarian Jews who subsidized those on the train who couldn't pay, friends of Kastner as well as [...] "community and Zionist leaders".

In 2006, Rove personally told Weh that Iglesias had been dismissed. Weh was dissatisfied with Iglesias {{due in part to}} his failure to indict New Mexico State Senator Manny Aragon on fraud and conspiracy charges. After Iglesias was dismissed, his replacement, Acting U.S. Attorney Larry Gomez brought a 26 count felony indictment against Aragon. In a plea bargain, Aragon plead guilty to three felony fraud counts. Weh followed up with, [...] "There’s nothing we’ve done that's wrong. It wasn’t that Iglesias wasn’t looking out for Republicans.

The meeting was closed and access was tightly controlled.

During the meeting, Nadezhda Tylik, the mother of Kursk submariner Lt. Sergei Tylik, was extremely emotional and interrupted the meeting.

[...] When she would not be quiet, a nurse in civilian apparel behind her forcibly injected her through her clothing with a sedative. She shortly thereafter lost the ability to speak and was carried out.

[...] Four months later she revealed that her husband had lied about the injection to the public to [...] "save my nerves" [...] and that he, in fact, [...] "did not ask for help."
