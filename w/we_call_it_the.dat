2500|$|Charvet ties, {{ranked as}} the best designer's ties in the USA, are handmade, {{generally}} from a thick multicolor brocade silk, of a high yarn count, often enhanced {{by the addition of}} a hidden color, producing a dense fabric which goes through a proprietary finishing to acquire lustre, fluidity and resilience and achieve the right knot. The company develops its own exclusive patterns and colors. It creates about 8,000 models per year, Jacquard woven on exclusive commission, with silk either alone or mixed with other precious yarns, such as cashmere, [...] camel hair, bamboo yarn or covered with laminated precious metals, such as silver, gold or platinum, with techniques dating back to the 14th century when the popes were based in Avignon, which were also used in the 1920s for vests. Further to a long history of brocade patterns, first used in the 19th century for vests and then for ties, Charvet offers, according to Bernhard Roetzel, the largest range of woven silk neckties in the world. The ties collection, sometime [...] "unmistakably bold" [...] or [...] "witty [...] wicked", often noted for its shimmer and changing colors (Charvet ties' shimmer [...] "has become so synonymous with the company that <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> Charvet effect", says a retailer.), uses about 5,000 shades in over 100,000 combinations.|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, DeVille made Victory Mixture, {{a tribute}} album of classic New Orleans soul and R which he {{recorded}} {{with some of}} the songs' original composers. The album was recorded without the use of overdubbing or sound editing with the goal of capturing the spirit of the original recordings.I got all the original guys to come back in, like Earl King, Dr. John and Eddie Bo. Allen Toussaint played side piano. I brought in the rhythm section of The Meters on a couple of cuts. <b>We</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> [...] "little" [...] record. It's funny, because I was just trying to get them money, the writers of the songs, 'cause they all got ripped off in the 1950s and 1960s. They were all fascinated, and Dr. John (who had played on DeVille's 1978 album Return to Magenta and who DeVille knew from his association with Doc Pomus) convinced them that they wouldn't get ripped off by this northern white boy. That's when I crossed over to being a local here in New Orleans. We were all pleased with it. It's recorded the way it was originally done back then. It's live with no overdubs anywhere, no digital, no editing. We played the song several times and just picked the best take, the one that was the most natural. It's on Fnac/Orleans Records. I'm really proud of that one. Victory Mixture was recorded for a small independent label, Orleans Records, which licensed it to Sky Ranch (Fnac Music) in France. [...] "It sold over 100,000 units in Europe very quicklyour first gold disc," [...] said Carlo Ditta, founder of Orleans Records and the producer of Victory Mixture.|$|E
