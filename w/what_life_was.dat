While her father was a scion of the Imperial family itself, her mother descended from daimyōs, the feudal or military aristocracy. Nagako would become one of the last Japanese who could remember <b>what</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> like inside the Japanese aristocracy in the years before the Second World War.|$|E

2500|$|Ford's image transfixed Europeans, {{especially}} the Germans, arousing the [...] "fear of some, the infatuation of others, and the fascination among all". Germans who discussed [...] "Fordism" [...] often {{believed that it}} represented something quintessentially American. They saw the size, tempo, standardization, and philosophy of production demonstrated at the Ford Works as a national service—an [...] "American thing" [...] that represented {{the culture of the}} United States. Both supporters and critics insisted that Fordism epitomized American capitalist development, and that the auto industry was the key to understanding economic and social relations in the United States. As one German explained, [...] "Automobiles have so completely changed the American's mode of life that today one can hardly imagine being without a car. It is difficult to remember <b>what</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> like before Mr. Ford began preaching his doctrine of salvation". For many Germans, Ford embodied the essence of successful Americanism.|$|E
2500|$|The poem {{was also}} {{frequently}} parodied. The poem [...] "Three Aces", signed [...] "Carl Byng", {{was published in}} the Buffalo Express in December 1870, not long after [...] "Plain Language from Truthful James" [...] first appeared. The poem was widely attributed to Mark Twain and labeled a [...] "feeble imitation" [...] of Harte. Twain angrily denied the charge and demanded a retraction, writing to the editor Thomas Bailey Aldrich, [...] "I am not in the imitation business". Harte, in turn, targeted Twain years later in his 1893 story [...] "Ingénue of the Sierras" [...] by creating an unsavory character named [...] "Charley Bing", modeled after Twain. The incident was one of several in a long rivalry between the two authors. In 1898, The Overland Monthly ran a poem making fun of Harte himself, who had moved to Europe in 1871 and never returned, for forgetting <b>what</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> like in the west.|$|E
2500|$|ZMET {{was born}} {{during a trip}} Zaltman took to remote areas of Nepal in 1990. [...] He gave locals, who had never taken photos before, cameras to take {{pictures}} of important things and events in their lives. [...] For example, in some cases, the assignment was: What photos would you take if you wanted to show someone else <b>what</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> like here? Two weeks later he returned to the regions covered initially, gave copies to the photographers, and interviewed them about the meaning of their photos. [...] Zaltman realized just how powerful the use of images “owned” by those being interviewed were in gaining a deep understanding of their implicit or tacit assumptions and beliefs. Zaltman noticed, for example, that they often cut off the feet of people appearing in their images. [...] It was discovered that this was deliberate. The Nepalese did not want to embarrass their friends and neighbors by showing their bare feet, which was a sign of poverty, and for this reason deliberately chose to leave it out of the photographic record.|$|E
