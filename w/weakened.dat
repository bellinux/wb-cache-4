5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, Hurricane Ramon {{began to}} weaken. Late on October10, Ramon <b>weakened</b> slightly while turning northwest. The following morning, the storm reportedly <b>weakened</b> into a Category 2. Hurricane Ramon began to rapidly deteriorate {{due to a}} combination of jetstream interactions and increasingly cold sea-surface temperatures. At 0600UTC on October11, the storm was downgraded into a Category1 on the SSHWS after bypassing the Category2 stage. It <b>weakened</b> into a tropical storm later that day and was further downgraded to a tropical depression on October12. Tropical Depression Ramon dissipated on 0600UTC that day. The remnant moisture of this hurricane later moved into Southern California, resulting in record rains.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} {{peak intensity}} for 36hours, Oliwa gradually <b>weakened</b> as {{it continued to}} the west-northwest, during which it passed through the Northern Marianas Islands. On September14, the typhoon slowed {{to the north of}} Okinawa, and it turned to the northeast toward Japan. As a <b>weakened</b> typhoon, Oliwa moved ashore on Makurazaki, Kagoshima, Kyushu with winds of 85mph (140km/h) late on September15. It <b>weakened</b> to tropical storm strength while crossing Japan, and deteriorated further to tropical depression status on September16. On September17, the JTWC issued the final advisory on Oliwa while it was in the eastern portion of the Sea of Japan. The JMA maintained advisories as the storm crossed northern Japan, and it accelerated over the open Pacific Ocean. On September19, Oliwa dissipated near the International Date Line to the south of the Aleutian Islands.|$|E
5|$|As Fefa turned {{more to the}} west, it paralleled {{the cooler}} waters, {{allowing}} the eye to remain distinct as the hurricane remained well-organized. Despite moving over marginally warm sea surface temperatures and becoming involved with the Stratocumulus cloud field to its north, the hurricane restrengthened on August 4 to reach a secondary peak intensity of 105mph (170km/h) while located about 1,265miles (2,070km) east-southeast of Hilo, Hawai'i. After maintaining 105mph (170km/h) winds for about 18hours, Fefa <b>weakened</b> slightly due to increasing wind shear from a cold-core trough as it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center area of responsibility. As the shear increased, the cyclone <b>weakened</b> more rapidly, and on August 6 it <b>weakened</b> to a tropical storm while located about 650miles (1,060km) east of the island of Hawaii. Initially, forecasters predicted Fefa {{to turn to the}} northwest {{to the north of the}} Hawaiian Islands. However, the storm continued moving almost due westward as it steadily <b>weakened.</b> Aircraft reconnaissance flew into Fefa three times as it neared Hawaii. Late on August 7, Fefa <b>weakened</b> to a tropical depression a short distance of the island of Hawaii, and early on August 8 the depression began dissipating and degenerated into a tropical wave after moving onshore. The remnants tracked west-northwestward and passed south of the Hawaiian Islands until dissipating on August 9 to the northwest of Kauai.|$|E
40|$|The {{endosperm}} is {{a barrier}} for radicle protrusion of many angiosperm seeds. Rupture of the testa (seed coat) and rupture of the endosperm are two sequential events during the germination of Lepidium sativum L. and Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heyhn. Abscisic acid (ABA) specifically inhibits the endosperm rupture {{of these two}} closely related Brassicaceae species. Lepidium seeds are large enough to allow the direct measurement of endosperm <b>weakening</b> by the puncture force method. We found that the endosperm <b>weakens</b> prior to endosperm rupture and that ABA delays the onset and decreases the rate of this <b>weakening</b> process in a dose-dependent manner. An early embryo signal is required and sufficient to induce endosperm <b>weakening,</b> which afterwards {{appears to be an}} organ-autonomous process. Gibberellins can replace this embryo signal; de novo gibberellin biosynthesis occurs in the endosperm and <b>weakening</b> is regulated by the gibberellin/ABA ratio. Our results suggest that the control of radicle protrusion during the germination of Brassicaceae seeds is mediated, at least in part, by endosperm <b>weakening.</b> We propose that Lepidium is an emerging Brassicaceae model system for endosperm <b>weakening</b> and that the complementary advantages of Lepidium and Arabidopsis can be used in parallel experiments to investigate the molecular mechanisms of endosperm <b>weakening...</b>|$|R

5|$|As Helene {{recurved}} {{and accelerated}} towards more northerly latitudes, it steadily <b>weakened.</b> By 1200 UTC on September 28, Helene {{was no longer}} a major hurricane. The hurricane's wind field also expanded from the storm's center as it <b>weakened.</b> By midday on September 29, Helene had <b>weakened</b> to minimal hurricane strength, and later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 1800 UTC that day, though it still maintained hurricane-force winds. At roughly the same time, Helene passed over Newfoundland, with gale force winds having expanded 500 mi (800 km) from the system's center, coinciding with the US Weather Bureau's final advisory on the system. Helene's extratropical remnants continued eastward across the Atlantic, becoming a dominant synoptic feature, before entirely dissipating by 0600 UTC on October 4 just west of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|By August9, {{increasing}} {{wind shear}} further <b>weakened</b> the storm, with Felicia being downgraded to {{a tropical storm}} early that day. The storm rapidly <b>weakened</b> throughout the day as convection gradually dissipated around the center due to the shear. By the late morning hours, little convective activity remained around the low pressure center of Felicia. A weak cyclone, the storm continued to track towards Hawaii with the only deep convection associated with it being displaced to the northeast of the center. The system slowly <b>weakened</b> before being downgraded to a tropical depression on August11 as no areas of tropical storm-force winds were found by Hurricane Hunters. Several hours after being downgraded, the CPHC issued its final advisory on Felicia as it degenerated into a remnant low near the Hawaiian Islands. The system dissipated shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Continuing to the west-southwest upon {{entering}} the basin, Evrina gradually <b>weakened</b> as the eye gradually dissipated. It soon encountered the same cooler waters of the southern Indian that affected previous storms Chikita and Davina. By April2, Evrina had <b>weakened</b> below tropical cyclone status, just 30hours after it was at peak intensity. Around that time, the circulation became exposed from the deepest convection, and the track shifted more to the west. On April5, Evrina <b>weakened</b> to tropical depression status. Two days later, the system turned toward the south, moving in a circular track around the island of Rodrigues while remaining far enough away not to cause any effects.

5|$|Cyclone Bejisa was a {{powerful}} tropical cyclone that affected the islands of RÃ©union and Mauritius in early January 2014. In late December 2013, a tropical disturbance developed {{to the north of}} Madagascar. With favorable conditions, the low developed into a disturbance and soon into a depression on December28. The system continued to develop and intensified into Moderate Tropical Storm Bejisa on December29, with rapid intensification occurring. It developed into an Intense Tropical Cyclone on December30, reaching peak maximum sustained winds of 165km/h (105mph). Due to an eyewall replacement cycle, Bejisa <b>weakened,</b> but re-intensified to a secondary peak of 160km/h (100mph) on January1. Increased wind shear <b>weakened</b> the eyewall, which passed within 15km (9mi) of RÃ©union. After having moved generally south-southeastward for much of its duration, Bejisa turned to the southwest on January3, by which time it had <b>weakened</b> to tropical storm status. It became a post-tropical cyclone on January5 after the convection <b>weakened</b> over the center, and Bejisa became extratropical the next day as it meandered southwest of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Fanele <b>weakened</b> quickly over land; {{within four}} hours of moving ashore, its winds {{decreased}} to 150km/h (95mph), and its wind field expanded. The eye feature dissipated as the system <b>weakened</b> to tropical storm status, and increased wind shear contributed to further weakening. By January22, the poorly defined circulation moved over open waters, by which time its winds <b>weakened</b> to about 45km/h (30mph). Upon reaching the ocean, convection began to reform near the circulation, and Fanele re-attained tropical storm status. Cooler waters caused convection diminish near the center, which began the process of extratropical transition. Late on January22, the JTWC issued its last advisory on the storm. By January23, Fanele completed the transition into an extratropical storm as it accelerated toward the south-southeast. It persisted as a distinct tropical cyclone until later that day.|$|E
5|$|Early on August11, {{the storm}} <b>weakened</b> {{slightly}} while crossing Florida. It then decelerated {{and reached the}} eastern Gulf of Mexico several hours later.

Early the next day, the storm attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 90mph (150km/h). It <b>weakened</b> slightly early on August14 and curved northwestward while approaching the coast of Louisiana. At 2100UTC, the storm made landfall near Buras with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Curving northeastward, the hurricane re-emerged into the Gulf of Mexico early on August15. However, around 1700UTC, it made another landfall near Ocean Springs, Mississippi at the same intensity.
