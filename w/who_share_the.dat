25|$|The disconfirmation (contradiction) of a belief, an ideal, or {{a system}} of values causes {{cognitive}} dissonance that can be resolved by changing the belief under contradiction; yet, instead of effecting change, the resultant mental stress restores psychological consonance to the person, either by mis-perception, by rejection, or by refutation of the contradiction; by seeking moral support from people <b>who</b> <b>share</b> <b>the</b> contradicted beliefs; and acting to persuade other people that the contradiction is unreal.|$|E

25|$|Churches {{such as the}} Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Churches {{practice}} closed communion {{under normal}} circumstances. However, the Catholic Church allows administration of the Eucharist, at their spontaneous request, to properly disposed members of the eastern churches (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Church of the East) not in full communion with it and of other churches that the Holy See judges to be sacramentally {{in the same position}} as these churches; and in grave and pressing need, such as danger of death, it allows the Eucharist to be administered also to individuals who do not belong to these churches but <b>who</b> <b>share</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church's faith in the reality of the Eucharist and have no access to a minister of their own community. Some Protestant communities exclude non-members from Communion.|$|E
25|$|A common {{aspect of}} {{recovery}} {{is said to}} be the presence of others who believe in the person's potential to recover, and who stand by them. While mental health professionals can offer a particular limited kind of relationship and help foster hope, relationships with friends, family and the community are said to often be of wider and longer-term importance. Others who have experienced similar difficulties, who may be on a journey of recovery, can be of particular importance. Those <b>who</b> <b>share</b> <b>the</b> same values and outlooks more generally (not just in the area of mental health) may also be particularly important. It is said that one-way relationships based on being helped can actually be devaluing, and that reciprocal relationships and mutual support networks can be of more value to self-esteem and recovery.|$|E
25|$|Social Networks {{are used}} also to {{communicate}} scientists research results {{and as a}} public communication tool and to connect people <b>who</b> <b>share</b> <b>the</b> same professional interests, their benefits can {{vary according to the}} discipline. The most interesting aspects of social networks for professional purposes are their potentialities in terms of dissemination of information and the ability to reach and multiply professional contacts exponentially. Social networks like Academia.edu, LinkedIn, Facebook, and ResearchGate give the possibility to join professional groups and pages, to share papers and results, publicize events, to discuss issues and create debates. Academia.edu is extensively used by researchers, where they follow a combination of social networking and scholarly norms. ResearchGate is also widely used by researchers, especially to disseminate and discuss their publications, where it seems to attract an audience that it wider than just other scientists.|$|E

25|$|The {{layout and}} {{function}} of the house compound of Bali Aga people is very different with the low Balinese house compound. The first differences is that each building in a house compound are not functionally differentiated. In lowland Balinese, each house (a pavilion or bale) has a specific function, e.g. bale meten is a pavilion for sleeping and paon is a pavilion for cooking. In Bali Aga house compound, each house is a self-contained entity where the sleeping area, kitchen, and all the functions of a house is situated. Unlike the lowland Balinese, where only certain people can use a certain pavilion (e.g. House Meten is only for {{the head of the}} household), each Bali Aga house is home to a married couple, their children, and sometimes a dependent elderly parent. A family unit in Bali Aga is known as kuren; kuren is a Bali Aga term for both a hearth and for a group of people <b>who</b> <b>share</b> <b>the</b> food cooked upon it.|$|E
25|$|Islam {{integrated}} {{the concept}} of Jinn from pre-Islamic animism, but reduced {{the status of the}} former divine Jinn to mortals and created entities, <b>who</b> <b>share</b> <b>the</b> earth along with humans and will be judged on judgement Day by the only one God. Accordingly, the society of Jinn resembles that of humans, and are believed to procreate, eat, sleep, die and practise religion. Due to their similarities with humans, several narrations hold, that humans and Jinn may have sexual interactions and some legal book even deal with conditions of a marriage between these different beings. Nevertheless, Islam forbids interaction with Jinn. The Jinn may also cause possession and harm humans, but Jinn attacks are considered as an result of their own intention instead of evil nature, although an individual Jinni maybe evil, but then because of its own decision. The Jinn live either in an intermediary realm, between the divine world and the physical plane, like the Greek Daemon and ancient Rome Genii or roaming earth invisible to humans eye.|$|E
