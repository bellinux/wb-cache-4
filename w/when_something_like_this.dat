If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

The light of the fire should not shine on the emperor." [...] Emperor Wu was {{surprised}} by this perceptive observation by a child, and praised the young prince as very much like his own grandfather Sima Yi. This was {{part of the reason why}} Emperor Wu let Crown Prince Zhong remain his heir. In 289, he created Prince Yu the Prince of Guangling. After Emperor Wu died in 290, Crown Prince Zhong ascended the throne as Emperor Hui, and Prince Yu was created crown prince.|$|R

Having a Reserve team is a big piece of developing potential local players but also keep the first team competitive. <b>When</b> you have <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> it can grow into a lot of different areas but it’s really about building this club the right way so we can be strong and have a great culture for the future," [...] Manny said.|$|R
5000|$|A {{refusal to}} {{disclose}} why Remini and Peete were fired brought {{on a great}} deal of criticism of the show and protests from the stars' fans. While there was much speculation that their former Talk co-host, Julie Chen, had involvement in the decision, as she is married to CBS President/CEO Leslie Moonves, it was Sharon Osbourne who stated, regarding their dismissals, in December 2011 on The Howard Stern Show: [...] "Some people don't really know who they are.

40|$|This thesis {{looks into}} the process of {{automatically}} expanding image searches based on tags and the definitions of terms from public knowledge bases. To this end, {{we will try to}} extract terms related to a query. The process of finding these terms is known as feature extraction. The text collection on which we perform this feature extraction is, in this thesis, based on text retrieved from public knowledge bases using the original query. The program will in other words, first retrieve related documents. It will then pick out related terms using either Chi-Squared, or an approach I've coined "Neighbouring Terms", or NT. The latter is an approach that is much quicker to process, and may prove to give good precision to term extraction, despite not having to perform such a demanding process beforehand. This thesis will also look into different variables in these kind of processes to find the best approach to both Chi-Squared and NT. Because this automatic term extraction is set to work on a limited size of articles, there is a question of how many articles would be needed to get the best results. There are also several similarity models to consider <b>when</b> building <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> For that reason, this thesis also {{looks into the}} different results obtained when working with models like the Vector Space model, Okapi BM 25 and the Language Model. Other variables that this thesis looks into is whether or not term pre-processing, like stop word removal and stemming, are beneficial or not. Also, what gives the best results between searching for abstracts based on their title or their contents, and with how many terms can a query be expanded without losing too much relatedness. To evaluate the terms suggested by these methods, this thesis looks into the P@n values for 20 queries, as well as using metrics such as MAP (Mean Average Precision) to evaluate the sum of the results for each approach. To avoid biased evaluation, we also perform a user survey. We present the results of a survey where 32 people have given their opinion on the different terms suggested by the system, and how related to a given query they are. The main conclusion in this thesis is that NT does run faster than Chi-Squared, but while results did vary, the precision values on an average fell in favour of Chi-Squared. That said, it did not perform better by much, and with future improvements it could prove a viable solution in automatically generating semantically related terms without having to perform heavy processing. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Mitzeee {{struggles in}} prison {{as she is}} tormented by other prisoners and Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane) is later {{transferred}} to Mitzeee's prison. Myra is convinced that Mitzeee stabbed her daughter and uses this opportunity to get revenge. Shenton told All About Soap: [...] "I think at that point Mitzeee just wonders if things could get any worse for her. She's already having a really rough time, and then Myra shows up. It's a very calculated decision on Myra's part to get moved to the same jail. Myra will battle tooth and nail for her daughter, {{and you can just}} imagine the fighting spirit she has. There's a lot of serious verbal scrapping between Myra and Mitzeee, which in some ways is worse than a punch-up." [...] Shenton also said that Riley is not as supportive as Mitzeee would like him to be as he is dealing with his own problems back in the village. She added that it's devastating for Mitzeee as she is madly in love with Riley and hopes that he will have a change of heart. Shenton said in September 2012 that Mitzeee will play a big role in the fifth series of Hollyoaks Later. Speaking to Inside Soap, Shenton revealed [...] "So many horrible things have happened to Mitzeee - she's so far removed from the girl she was six months ago. This whole chain of events sends her into an even deeper depression. Her mum comes to visit her in jail, and that's the first point viewers will see something's really not quite right with Mitzeee now." [...] She later added that Mitzeee's recent experiences will [...] "change her for the good" [...] and she will come out fighting. Shenton said that all of the latest trouble's in Mitzeee's life has ruled out any possibility of returning to her [...] "glamour past" [...] and that being framed for attempted murder has [...] "hardened her". Speaking to a Daily Star reporter, Shenton said that [...] "When she first arrived a year ago, she was this ditzy glamour model with big hair. Now you've seen a different side to her. I think this has changed her forever. I'd like to see her go back to a version of herself but I don't think you can ever go right back <b>when</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> has happened." ...|$|E
