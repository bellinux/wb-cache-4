40|$|This paper {{speaks to}} two {{articles}} {{that have been}} published in Gender and Education. The first, and most obvious, is that of Tett (2000). Lynn Tett's paper is concerned with an analysis of community activists 'returning' to education. I offer a complementary reading of Tett (2000) in the hope of illustrating the saliency of postcolonial perspectives for developing theorisation in the field of 'women returners'. I do this by drawing on the metaphors of 'exile' (Benhabib, 1992) and 'nomad' (Braidotti, 1994) in order to explore the issues of location and transition that form part of the material and subjective experiences of the returning woman. More immanent, however, is a conversation with Francis (1999). Becky Francis explores the relations between poststructuralism and the modernist emancipatory project of feminism. She illustrates the tensions in the binary of poststructural/modern and makes an appeal that we need to continue to worry away at the 'theoretical brick wall' (p 391) of this binary. My purpose is to contribute to Francis' appeal through the analysis that I present of the multiply located subject-in-process that is the <b>woman</b> <b>returner.</b> Specifically I argue that if we seriously wish to worry away at the binaries in academic debate we need to develop practices of critical literacy that recognise the reader as similarly multiply located and subjectively-in-process. As it is much of the contemporary literature continues to set up the reader as the humanist subject who can rationally choose, and is willing to be fixed by, some form of 'correct' intellectual position...|$|E
40|$|Women {{who take}} a career break face {{additional}} difficulties in returning to and progressing their careers in {{engineering and technology}} research. Helping women re-enter and develop skills to advance in such careers {{has been the subject}} of a great deal of Government discussion in the United Kingdom for several years. In response to the 2002 ‘SET Fair’ report a UK Resource Centre for Women in Science Engineering and Technology was established as the government’s lead agency on women in SET. One of its key objectives is to support SET <b>women</b> <b>returners.</b> The Open University in partnership with the UK Resource Centre for Women in SET has developed a course for <b>women</b> <b>returners</b> to offer support and direction in helping them return to SET. This paper will explore the impact of the OU online course which has already attracted over 500 <b>women</b> <b>returners,</b> showing how <b>women</b> are supported in refreshing their research skills and identifying opportunities to return to their careers. We will highlight how the course and additional services offered by the UK Resource Centre such as work placements, peer mentoring and networking events have helped women in their return to SET careers...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results of a study about the {{perceptions}} of women who have returned to work after taking a career break due to family responsibilities (<b>women</b> <b>returners).</b> Most of the women who participated in the study believed that their career breaks and ongoing family commitments had adversely affected their careers. The participants also believed that, because of the skills they had acquired through their roles as caregivers and home managers, they were better employees. However, not all of the women valued those skills themselves, and many believed that their employers did not recognise them either. The study also found that <b>women</b> <b>returners</b> have various needs that, if not met, become barriers to their ability to be involved in paid work. The two most commonly reported needs were reduced hours and flexi-time. Good quality and affordable childcare, understanding from managers and colleagues, and a change in societal attitudes that equate time spent at work with ability and commitment were also important needs of <b>women</b> <b>returners.</b> Conclusions that arose suggest that employers should change policies and train managers and those involved in the recruitment and selection process {{to meet the needs of}} <b>women</b> <b>returners.</b> This will increase the organisation's ability to develop creative solutions that will support the needs of both the organisation and its employees. Furthermore, the government needs to consider the implementation of paid parental leave and allowing all childcare expenses to be claimed against earnings. Through implementing these suggestions, mothers will have more choice about when they return to work, allowing them to better meet their own needs as well as those of their families...|$|R
40|$|To {{fulfill the}} {{requirements}} for the degree of Master of Education in School Counselling, this report {{provides an overview of}} the Author's internship experiences and research at Harlow College in Harlow, Essex, England. The report is divided into two sections: The Internship and the Research Component. The first section provides a rationale for an Internship in England, a description of the internship setting including: a brief history of Harlow Town; a description of Harlow College facilities; a discussion of experiences; and recommendations for future graduate students. The second section is a summary of the Author's research at Harlow College. This research examined how Harlow College can better meet the needs <b>women</b> <b>returners</b> or re-entry <b>women,</b> as commonly referred in the English literature. The results of this qualitative research suggest Harlow College is meeting many of the needs of <b>women</b> <b>returners,</b> however, there are still areas where improvements could be made. Some of the suggested recommendations include: affordable creche facility on campus; better lighting in the parking lot and on campus; a mandatory session with a careers guidance person for all <b>women</b> <b>returners</b> (full and part-time); an orientation session for all mature returners; scholarships for women returners; alternate teaching and evaluation methods; flexibility and accommodations to students who may have to miss time due to family commitments; support groups for mature students; and counselling services...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{work life}} balance issues facing women {{returning}} {{to work in}} STEM after a career break, based on the experiences of participants in an online course at the UK Open University. The course provided a series of personal development planning activities, and required them to focus on work life balance issues, identifying the factors {{they would need to}} consider in order to successfully return to work. The term Work Life Balance has entered everyday discourse as a way to articulate the conflicts and dilemmas raised by changing work patterns and life choices. For those who are contemplating returning to paid work after a period away from the labour market, the achievement of a balance between the demands of their working life and those of their other commitments becomes of paramount concern. Considerations are not just practical but also emotional and raise fundamental issues about women’s roles as well as personal priorities and ambitions Research suggests that there are particular problems within STEM sectors for <b>women</b> <b>returners</b> such as the lack of flexible and part time working opportunities, and long hours culture. Other studies have indicated that women make choices about working in these sectors based on evaluation of their work life balance options, and putting family considerations first, often jeopardise their future career progression There is an expectation of mobility for most scientific careers, particularly academic careers. Young single women are just as likely to take up these opportunities abroad as their male colleagues, but once women have partners and children {{they are less likely to}} do this. Moreover women scientists are more likely than men to be in relationships with other scientists whose careers will also require mobility – in such cases it is more often the women in these “dual career” relationships who decide not to take up opportunities that require moving abroad, especially when there are children involved. These women are thus more likely to follow their male partners in ‘tied migration’ than vice versa. Not all returners have had career breaks for raising children - others take time to study, to travel, to look after elderly parents, or due to their own ill heath. However, the overwhelming majority of <b>women</b> <b>returners</b> in our study had taken breaks in order to do ‘family work’ prioritising this over career progression. Choices are not made in a vacuum but in the context of patriarchal societal values, and in the case of the STEM industries, within the context of masculine work ethics and cultural norms. <b>Women</b> <b>returners,</b> not only face practical issues and constraints when they decide to return to work, but they are also faced with a change in their identities and orientation towards work and motherhood In order to gain a more in depth understanding of how women perceive and deal with the range of issues loosely labelled under the heading ‘work life balance’ we analysed the women’s responses to this activity and their views on Work Life Balance in the context of returning to their STEM careers. Qualitative data came from online conferences contributions, telephone interviews and online surveys carried out after the completion of the course. This revealed a similar set of outcomes to those found in previous studies of <b>women</b> <b>returners</b> including significant levels of underemployment. Of those who had found employment after the course, 46...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify factors which influence decisions concerning significant career moves among older workers and <b>women</b> <b>returners.</b> A questionnaire survey of older workers was conducted in order to elicit the salient attitudes to, experience of, and satisfaction with work of job changers and non-changers aged 50 years and over, employed within a nationwide retail organisation. Results were based on 228 questionnaires. Respondents ranged in age from 50 to 73 years, 54 % were female, 46 % male. Respondents demonstrated a significant increase in self-perception the perceived benefits of working far outweighed perceived difficulties. There were {{differences between men and women}} in the prompts to change employment and in salient attitudes to work. A questionnaire survey of <b>women</b> <b>returners</b> was conducted to explore items women considered when embarking on college courses, their experience of these same items while at college, and the relationship between the decision considerations and subjective well-being. The results of 336 questionnaires were analysed. Respondents ranged in age from 16 to 62 years. The expected benefits of attending college were given greater consideration than expected risks, confirming work by Janis and Mann (1977). Actual benefits and actual problems were overall the most useful predictors of college related well-being. There were differences between young and mature students, women with and without partners, and those with and without dependents in terms of items on the motivator for college attendance, expected benefit and risk and actual benefit and problem scales. The Warr Subjective Well Being (SWB) scale was shown to be a reliable measure of college related well-being. The wide age range and life experience of respondents in both studies confirms the utility of life event models of development and the desirability of developing a flexible person-centred counselling model for decision making...|$|R
40|$|Measures {{to support}} women {{to return to}} the science, {{engineering}} and technology (SET) labour market have been implemented {{over the past three decades}} in response to the overall shortage of SET skills, as well as with the aim of (re) empowering individual women through their improved financial independence and labour market participation. Yet their needs remain poorly analysed and the impact of labour market reintegration measures appears to have been patchy. This paper examines the experiences of women re-entering the SET labour market after a break from employment in the light of assumptions made about them in UK public policy, particularly related to labour market and employment. Drawing on evidence from surveys and interview data from two groups of <b>women</b> <b>returners</b> to SET we conclude that their needs are more diverse and complex than is recognised in much policy thinking and practice, and that these differ at specific points within the lifecycle.

All errors and omissions remain the authors. Executive Summary This paper reports on research on the employment effects of lifelong learning for a cohort of British women. Responsibility for caring for children and other dependent family members continues to be borne mainly by women, and they frequently have spells out of paid employment as a consequence. Lifelong learning is often regarded as playing a key role in maintaining and enhancing the employability of <b>women</b> <b>returners.</b> It is argued that lifelong learning can prevent skills depreciation for women who have had long breaks from paid employment and that those who missed out on initial education may require lifelong learning in order to obtain essential basic skills To date, however, the evidence on whether lifelong learning really does have beneficial employment effects has been very sparse. The data used in this paper came from the National Child Development Study (NCDS). The NCDS is a continuing longitudinal survey of people living in Great Britain who were born in the first week of March 1958. Members of the NCDS cohort have been interviewed on...|$|R

The research aims, via a survey of mothers and fathers, to gather information on the provision of family-friendly working practices (including maternity and parental leave), and respondents' views, awareness and take-up of such measures. NatCen Social Research and The Policy Studies Institute have conducted a number of surveys of mothers {{on behalf of the}} Department for Work and Pensions and its predecessors, in 1980, 1988, 1993, 1996, 2002 and 2009 - 2010. Of these, the 1993, 2002 and 2009 - 2010 surveys are currently held at the UK Data Archive (UKDA), under SN 3716, SN 5270 and SN 7349 respectively. Two further surveys in the series have also been conducted, in 2005 and 2007, and will be deposited at the UKDA in due course. Maternity and Paternity Rights Survey, 2009 - 2010 The 2009 - 2010 survey benchmarks key policy changes since the 2007 survey, including the Work and Families Act 2006. The survey was commissioned by Department for Work and Pensions and Department for Business Innovation and Skills and carried out by NatCen Social Research. The aims of the survey were: to examine the impact of the 2007 maternity rights legislative changes on mothers engagement and experience in the labour market prior to, and following, the birth through tracking changes from the 2007 survey; to provide a detailed, statistically representative, up-to-date picture of mothers experiences and take up of maternity rights and benefits to identify the impact of the 2007 legislative changes, and to provide a baseline against which the impact of future changes can be measured; to identify differences in take-up and eligibility (including all types of leave and pay, including Occupational Maternity Pay) related to individual characteristics, job characteristics and employer characteristics and how it has changed following the introduction of the 2007 reforms; to examine what enables <b>women</b> <b>returners</b> to remain in work, to explore the choices and constraints behind non-working mothers remaining out of the labour market post childbirth and what would enable them to return to work including childcare usage; to examine fathers take-up of paternity leave and paternity pay in order to collect robust data on the various provisions for fathers during and after the mothers pregnancy; to explore the attitudes of both fathers and mothers on sharing the childcare responsibility during the six months additional maternity leave. Main Topics : The main topics included: mothers' engagement and experience in the labour market prior to, and following birth; mothers' experiences and take up of maternity rights and benefits to identify the impact of the 2007 legislative changes; what enables <b>women</b> <b>returners</b> to remain in work; to explore the choices and constraints behind non-working mothers remaining out of the labour market post childbirth and what would enable them to return to work including childcare usage; fathers' take-up of paternity leave and paternity pay; attitudes of both fathers and mothers on sharing the childcare...|$|R
40|$|Maternity {{leave and}} the {{transition}} {{back to work}} is a crucial episode in the life course of women workers in general but takes on particular dynamics when the return is into male dominated professions such as science engineering and technology. Research shows that women in these sectors struggle with an in/visibility paradox whereby they are highly visible as women but invisible as engineers (Faulkner 2009). Motherhood exacerbates these gender differences within many organisational cultures and therefore the transition back into employment often reveals underlying assumptions within organisations which returning women must find a range of strategies to navigate. In this paper, the experiences of women SET professionals taking career breaks is explored through their own narratives using ‘positioning’ {{as a way of}} examining the meanings they give to events surrounding their maternity or career breaks and subsequent return to work. Interaction with line managers, colleagues, family members and wider social networks during this crucial transition stage are framed and interpreted according to different narratives - so for example serendipity or ‘luckiness’ is often used to explain success. By adopting these different narrative positions, these <b>women</b> <b>returners</b> can be seen to be engaging with and making sense of a complex set of external and internal messages about their roles and identities during the crucial transition into working parenthood. Yet their narratives must also be seen as time-bound and as ‘biographies in the making’ rather than static accounts which may include taking multiple and contradictory positions...|$|R
40|$|Rural Broadnet {{is funded}} by the HEFCE under a {{widening}} provision programme {{which is designed to}} increase access to higher education for groups within society who traditionally suffer from poor access. The project’s brief is to widen HE participation in rural areas utilising, where possible and necessary, an information technology infrastructure. The project’s programme is needs led and characterised by community level partnerships, it does not aim for high specification hardware, software or communications technology. Its focus is to facilitate delivery of education, training, information and advice to local rural communities using technology which is accessible to, and affordable by, those communities. Particular target groups are the unemployed, <b>women</b> <b>returners,</b> older people, the 16 + age group and those on low or negative income. Local businesses, mainly agriculture related sole-traders, with low skill levels and a poor tradition of training are also seen as a target group. This project differs from many others in that it has focused on communities, has identified local needs and attempted to meet those needs, rather than simply impose the established University ‘learner’ model. A number of locally based and managed IT centres have been established, and these support a diverse range of course delivery and learning materials, from basic word processor use to Internet access and web site development. The Rural Broadnet team have become facilitators of a negotiated, student centred, learning experience which is supported at the local level by collaborative partnerships involving community groups, voluntary sector organisations, training providers and other agencies...|$|R
40|$|The thesis was {{basically}} exploratory in nature. A staged life cycle model, with three key stages, was developed which jointly incorporated women's work and motherhood roles. The chosen stages {{led to a}} focus on white middle-class women. This was therefore the target group from which the samples were drawn and the focus of any generalisation from these studies. The primary focus of the work was on the decision-making processes that women go through in {{making the transition from}} one stage to the next. This was looked at in terms of a cost/benefit model that incorporated meaning through an exploration of the stresses and satisfactions that women experienced at the three identified stages. This allowed the initial decision-making model to be 'unpacked', and the relevant factors to be identified. These were considered in detail and looked at {{in the context of the}} relevant literature. One factor, role conflict, was explored further in a separate survey where roles were found to be potential sources of support as well as of demands. In looking at the decision to return to work, five factors were found to be particularly important to the women, and these were successfully checked for reliability in a separate study. The research was started in 1986, and the surveys were undertaken in 1987 and 1988. Results also allowed the formulation of a stress/satisfaction model, and when looked at in relation to the decision-making processes, it was postulated that decision-making would be easier if certain criteria were met. The decision-making model was used to explore the implications for women's training in general, and the training of <b>women</b> <b>returners</b> in particular. In relation to the latter, it was found that women anticipating the return to work expected it to be more stressful than did those women actually experiencing that stage, suggesting that women may overestimate the size of the problem at the post-break stage, and thus delay returning to the labour market. The strengths and weaknesses of the models were recognized and certain recommendations for further research were made...|$|R
40|$|Women {{returning}} {{to work after}} a break have {{been the target of}} programmes and initiatives within the adult and higher education sectors for many years: they have also been the focus of government concern at times of skills shortages. Often drawing on feminist principles and pedagogies, such initiatives have generally aimed to empower women and raise their awareness of gender issues {{at the same time as}} offering skills and training in preparation for employment (Coats, 1996; Ellen & Herman, 2005, Phipps 2008). The initiative discussed in this chapter has its roots in these traditions, but by using an online environment has been able to offer a new programme to a wider and more diversely distributed target group, as well as focussing on the needs of a specific group: women already qualified in Science, Engineering or Technology (SET) subject areas. The chapter begins by outlining the continuing problem of under-representation of women and girls in SET including the specific needs of women in these sectors. We then discuss the background to, and rationale for, a recent programme of support measures developed by the UK government, one of which is an innovative online course which was developed by an established network of educators with a commitment to gender issues. The course, aimed at women SET graduates who want to return to work in this employment sector after a career break, is described and its impact discussed. We, the authors of this paper, are all members of the team responsible for creation and delivery of this course. We have also been involved (along with an external independent team) in evaluating how well the course has achieved its objectives. In this context we are action researchers; the research data continue to be collected on the course, and changes to the course are made iteratively in response to this research and to other aspects of the environment. We end this chapter by generalising from our experience to make some recommendations for taking forward this kind of innovatory educational model for <b>women</b> <b>returners</b> in other areas. The recommendations are relevant within a global context, but this chapter is mainly concerned with UK employment priorities, and the models discussed were developed to meet these...|$|R

The aim of this survey was to establish the views and needs of {{a representative sample of}} heads of schools in each of three counties concerning in-service training. Main Topics : Attitudinal/Behavioural Questions This survey follows the general format of 67014, asking similar questions but with the orientation towards the needs of heads of schools. After a general assessment of views held on current in-service training programmes, heads are asked to list the types of programmes and courses which have provided outstanding benefit to schools (with details), topics deemed important for future courses generally, and for each of three teacher groups (heads and responsible positions; part-timers, married <b>women</b> <b>returners</b> and late entrants; and other full-time teachers), method and teacher group priorities recommended for the future, and general experience of, and opinions on, full-time secondment in school time. A list of 'solutions' to problems of secondment are placed in order of applicability and desirability (e. g. supply teachers, reorganization of schedules etc.), and heads' attitudes towards teachers after completion of courses are assessed (e. g. is promotion to be expected, should teaching methods automatically change, what is the maximum age of eligibility for secondment etc.). Concerning information on in-service training courses, the head is asked for the most effective means of dissemination, and role of his personal discretion in such dissemination. A series of specific questions on methods used in current training programmes is followed by recommendations for priorities in the future, alternative schemes for dealing with scheduling problems of in-service training during school time, individual circumstances which stop head attending in-service training and his own personal history of programme completion (with details and dates). Willingness to participate in future courses on full-time secondment during vacations, in out-of school hours, and length of time which would be made available is elicited. A final question asks for a personal definition of 'curriculum' and 'teaching methods'. A discussion of any follow-up activities carried out in the particular school completed the substantive portion of the survey. Background Variables Age cohort, sex, full-time teaching experience, marital status, number of dependents, professional status, total number of years as head of school. The school is graded according to area within the county, sex and age of school population...|$|R

However, we also argue for a perspective which takes account of the culture of the profession and which undermines the assumption of economic rationality underpinning many labour market studies. Similarly, our exploration of the potential of training for easing labour-market re-entry is evaluated {{within the context of the}} gendered ethos of the solicitor's profession, as is the discussion of the curriculum design issues in professional women returners' training which arise out of the research...|$|R
