5|$|Blitz {{conceived}} a rough storyline for {{the film}} while making Spellbound, a documentary about 1999's Scripps National Spelling Bee, but an HBO Films executive persuaded him to write the film based on his own adolescence <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> about his experiences as a stutterer. The film's producers visited several cities in the United States and Canada; Thompson was cast based on a tape which his agent had sent and a follow-up audition after the first actor cast in the lead was forced to pull out. The film was shot over 30 days in Baltimore, Maryland and Trenton, New Jersey.|$|E
25|$|Poirot {{speaks to}} Jean and tells {{her that the}} {{conversation}} Nurse Harrison claimed to have overheard seemed psychologically unlikely as two possible conspirators would never had had such a conversation {{in a place where}} they could be easily listened to. He observed the nurse's positive reaction <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of a possible exhumation and then had her followed by Georges who witnessed the buying of the compact and the laying of the trap for Jean. The motive was jealousy as Nurse Harrison was convinced by Oldfield's kind manner over several years that he intended her to be his bride.|$|E
500|$|Jerry dares Elaine {{to take an}} egg roll from someone's {{plate and}} eat it, {{offering}} her [...] "fifty bucks" [...] to do so. Elaine approaches a table with an elderly couple and tells them that her friend will give her $50 to eat one of their egg rolls, and she is willing to give them $25 of it. As she softly speaks the offer without moving her lips, they fail to comprehend her. She awkwardly walks away, then laughs off her attempt. George is finally able to call Tatiana, but he gets the answering machine, so he leaves a message. Tatiana calls the restaurant to reach George, but the maître d' calls [...] "Cartwright" [...] instead of [...] "Costanza", and she [...] "said curse word" [...] <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that George is not there. When the mysterious woman encounters Jerry, he remembers belatedly that she is his uncle's receptionist and becomes upset knowing that she'll tell his uncle, who then will tell his parents and so on.|$|E
60|$|Sir Patrick said no more. Anne's {{face was}} before him {{again at the}} memorable moment <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that she was Geoffrey's wife.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Barbara Walters called Van Praagh {{dangerous}} <b>when,</b> after <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{privately that}} she had an elevated white blood-cell count, test results showed no blood abnormalities.|$|R
60|$|Noel {{closed the}} piano, {{and sat down}} on the divan. Her face had the same {{expression}} as <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that she could not marry Cyril Morland.|$|R
500|$|McCartney {{recommended}} {{his friend}} George Harrison {{to be the}} lead guitarist. Lennon thought that Harrison—then 14 years old—was too young. McCartney engineered an audition on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, where Harrison played Raunchy for Lennon and was asked to join. Stuart Sutcliffe, Lennon's friend from art school, later joined as bassist. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Sutcliffe became [...] "The Beatles" [...] in early 1960. In August that year, the Beatles engaged for a 48-night residency in Hamburg, Germany and were desperately {{in need of a}} drummer. They asked Pete Best to join them. Lennon was now 19, and his aunt, horrified <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> about the trip, pleaded with him to continue his art studies instead. After the first Hamburg residency, the band accepted another in April 1961, and a third in April 1962. Like the other band members, Lennon was introduced to Preludin while in Hamburg, and regularly took the drug, as well as amphetamines, as a stimulant during their long, overnight performances.|$|E
500|$|Faced {{with intense}} {{competition}} from the other astronauts, particularly John Glenn, Shepard quit smoking, and adopted Glenn's habit of taking a morning jog, {{although he did not}} {{go so far as to}} give up the cocktails or the philandering. On January 19, 1961, Robert R. Gilruth, the director of NASA's Space Task Group, informed the seven astronauts that Shepard had been chosen for the first American manned mission into space. Shepard later recalled Louise's response <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that she had her arms around the man who would be the first man in space: [...] "Who let a Russian in here?" [...] During training he flew 120 simulated flights. Although his flight was originally scheduled for April 26, 1960, it was postponed several times by unplanned preparatory work, initially to December 5, 1960, then mid-January 1961, March 6, 1961, April 25, 1961, May 2, 1961, and finally to May 5, 1961. On April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person in space, and the first to orbit the Earth. It was another body blow to American pride. When Shepard heard the news he slammed his fist down on a table so hard a NASA public relation officer feared he might have broken it.|$|E
500|$|In addition, Tessa {{shares with}} MacLeod the {{consequences}} of his involvement in the Game. She dislikes the Game and would like to escape from it with him, since she fears for his life. According to Vandernoot, Tessa [...] "...always thought that she [...] die before [...] ", but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> about the Game during [...] "The Gathering", [...] "she [...] that he [...] be killed", thus she avoided thinking about it. Another consequence of the Game is that Tessa is sometimes exposed to danger from Immortals who want to use her to pressure MacLeod. Despite being captured by Quince in [...] "The Gathering", by the time of [...] "Band of Brothers", she is able to face Grayson: [...] "If you think [...] will stand by, ...you have misjudged him terribly. So you'd better kill me, now, and be done with it." [...] Grayson releases her and calls her [...] "...a remarkable woman, well worth keeping alive." [...] Consequently, Tessa is fully aware of the risks of their relationship, but stays with MacLeod, explaining in [...] "Eyewitness" [...] that [...] "I know the risks I choose to take... I stay with you because I want to. I won't run. I'm not the little woman and I'll never be barefoot and pregnant. We all have things to face. This is mine." [...] However, she finds it difficult to deal with her fears when MacLeod leaves to fight another Immortal.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Dave! {{were you}} sure it was that Ward Porton?" [...] {{questioned}} his sister, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> and Jessie about {{the appearance of the}} former moving-picture actor.|$|R
60|$|Hilary, who {{was also}} shivering, hastened to Bianca's room. She was just coming down, and exclaimed at seeing him all wet. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of the episode she touched his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Sally, {{occupied}} with her dogs, whose numbers had now been augmented {{by a white}} terrier with a black patch over its left eye, {{could not see the}} young man's face: but his voice, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> replied, <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that something was wrong. There was a false airiness in it.|$|R
500|$|After {{the success}} of his 2002 {{documentary}} Spellbound, Jeffrey Blitz was encouraged by his agents to write fiction because of the larger revenue brought in by fiction films. Blitz began to piece together a story that had come to him while he had been filming Spellbound: [...] "I kept thinking, what if we met a kid that was just an amazing lover of words? What if we met a kid that was lured into the spelling bee because {{he was in love with}} a girl?" [...] He had compiled a mental list of characters who he expected to encounter while making Spellbound, several of whom eventually became Rocket Science characters. Despite claiming to be [...] "allergic" [...] to autobiographical films, he was persuaded by HBO executive Maud Nadler to write a screenplay based on his own adolescence <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that, as a teenager, he joined his school's debate team to try and overcome his stutter. He says that he is uninterested in teen films, so [...] "the only way I was going to do a teen movie is if I felt like I could try to be more honest about what the actual experience of being a teenager is like." [...] He was aware of the clichés in teen films, so [...] "tried to undo them without wrecking them". Blitz wrote the script [...] "off and on" [...] over a year in between stints of commercial directing. He cites directors Hal Ashby and Billy Wilder as his greatest influences with their absurdist comedies, though critics have suggested influence from Gary Larson, Alexander Payne, Mike Nichols and Wes Anderson—the latter despite Blitz specifically saying, [...] "I did not want a Wes Andersen [...] snowglobe artificial world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Angela Wright later {{claimed that}} her brother had {{foreseen}} the September 11 attacks <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that as {{she was living in}} New York she was abiding in a [...] "city of sin"; he then went on to predict that the World Trade Center towers would be destroyed from the air.|$|E
2500|$|When {{they arrived}} home, a letter {{was waiting for}} Francisco from Governor Marina which said: [...] "If you give any {{assistance}} to the American men of war, you will be executed tomorrow morning at the beach." [...] After reading the note, Guam's leading merchant laughed. His wife, an American woman he had married in San Francisco, asked {{what was in the}} message, and became apprehensive <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her.</b> Jose warned him to be careful, especially when he learned that boats had already been promised to the Americans. His brother replied that the boats would be delivered in the morning regardless of the threatening message.|$|E
60|$|She {{could not}} rest {{until she had}} sent for Homos and told him of this admirable arrangement. I {{did not know whether}} to be glad or not <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{instantly}} <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that, if there was to be any such separation of his auditors, in recognition of our class distinctions, he must refuse to speak at all.|$|R
50|$|The Mother {{cuts off}} the story again {{when they reach}} her {{apartment}} building. After exchanging goodbyes, Ted walks away as Future Ted says he didn't make the mistake he made eight years earlier during his first date with Robin, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> prematurely <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>he</b> loves her. Much to Ted's relief, the Mother calls him back and asks him to finish the story.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a word!" [...] And {{he looked}} at her as he had looked on that day <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of the Major's sins. She tossed her head and pouted her lips and walked on without speaking. If it was to be so, then indeed would she have failed. And, therefore, though in his general manner he was loving to her, things were not going smooth with her.|$|R
2500|$|He {{turned his}} {{basement}} into [...] practice {{space for a}} band he formed with high-school friends. After the band began earning income from small performances at high-school shows or other events, he decided {{to drop out of}} high school and play rock and roll professionally. His mother was devastated <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> and he still feels that he owes her for the disappointments in her life. [...] "All the shit I put her through," [...] he says, [...] "on top {{of the fact that she}} just lost her husband. I felt like I had to make sure that it was worth it. I wanted to show her that I was a professional, that I was working hard, and wasn't just a fuckin' lunatic." ...|$|E
2500|$|GRodiles also {{praised the}} {{interactions}} between Sinon and Kirito after Kirito revealed to her his true gender, claiming [...] "the series deserves some props for the way how they executed Kirito and Sinon's recent interaction [...] While most viewers might criticize SAO for having Sinon react negatively towards Kirito <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> the truth, the guy kind of deserved it for not being honest with her when they first met. Thanks to this situation, we can see both characters develop {{in a way that}} won't turn into a mindless sequence where Kazuto pretends to be a woman; thus destroying any distractions that would prevent the show's plot from moving forward." [...] In a review of the first Blue-Ray disc of the Sword Art Online II anime, Theron Martin of Anime News Network praised Sinon as a [...] "strong female co-lead", noting how unlike the other recurring female characters of the franchise, she is the only one not defined by her relationship with Kirito, but rather an incident from her past.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the spur}} of the moment in [...] "The Recombination Hypothesis", Leonard asks Penny out on a date after he imagines what getting back with her might be like. Their real date ends {{successfully}} and they agree to take their relationship slow in [...] "The Beta Test Initiation." [...] During their renewed relationship Penny has dismissed comments about him ever leaving or dumping her or about worrying about his unfaithfulness around other women and strippers as in the episode [...] "The Stag Convergence". After Penny suggested having sex in [...] "The Launch Acceleration", Leonard breaks the mood by proposing to her accidentally. They later meet and Penny does have the courage to tell him [...] "no" [...] and not break up with him as she did two years previously <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that he loved her. However, their relationship is still obviously strained. In season 5, Leonard and Penny watch Howard being launched into space while holding hands to comfort each other. With the start of season 6, he wants a reluctant Penny to define their relationship in [...] "The Date Night Variable".|$|E
60|$|The Princess {{stood up}} when she saw him, and her heart beat with fear, for {{she did not know}} him. But <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> who <b>he</b> was, in her great joy she forgot all her sufferings, and they seemed as nothing to her. He was a very {{handsome}} man, as straight as a fir tree. They sat down together and she <b>told</b> him all <b>her</b> adventures, and he wept with pity at the tale. And then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> his own history.|$|R
50|$|The last victim, Matilda U. (67), {{was murdered}} on March 4, 1992, {{in the center}} of Bratislava in a porch house in Obchodná street. That night, Rigo was in movie theater Dukla (today known as YMCA) on Šancová street {{together}} with his girlfriend. They were returning home together <b>when</b> <b>he</b> suddenly <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>he</b> {{had to take care of}} something and got off the trolleybus. He didn't come home until morning.|$|R
60|$|When Eric betook {{himself to}} the orchard the next evening {{he had to admit}} that he felt rather nervous. He did not know how the Gordons would receive him and {{certainly}} the reports he had heard of them were not encouraging, to say the least of it. Even Mrs. Williamson, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> where <b>he</b> was going, seemed to look upon him as one bent on bearding a lion in his den.|$|R
2500|$|Brennan (who was now {{a senior}} at Homestead) did not have plans to attend college, and was {{supportive}} of Jobs <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> he planned {{to drop out of}} Reed because {{he did not want to}} spend his parents' money on it (neither her father nor Jobs's adoptive parents had gone to college). He continued to attend by auditing classes, including a course on calligraphy taught by Robert Palladino, but since he was no longer an official student, Brennan stopped visiting him. Jobs later asked her to come and live with him in a house he rented near the Reed campus, but she refused. He had started seeing other women, and she was interested in someone she met in her art class. Brennan speculates that the house was Jobs's attempt to make their relationship monogamous again. In a 2005 commencement speech for Stanford University, Jobs states that during this period, he slept on the floor in friends' dorm rooms, returned Coke bottles for food money, and got weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple. In that same speech, Jobs said: [...] "If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Nancy is with Mitzeee, {{she gets}} [...] "sudden twinges" [...] which {{she does not}} worry about until [...] "the contractions really start to kick in. She's only 26 weeks' {{pregnant}} and she's totally terrified". Nancy calls Darren who takes her to hospital where she is [...] "doubled over in agony". The doctors try giving Nancy medication to stop the contractions which fails. Nancy has an emergency Caesarean and gives birth to a boy who the doctors are unsure if he will [...] "make it through the night" [...] which Fox said is a [...] "terrible time for Nancy and Darren". Darren blames Nancy for their babies premature birth, Dawson explained that this is because he believes that Nancy did not [...] "take proper care of herself during her pregnancy". He said that Nancy seemed to be preoccupied with Mitzeee and [...] "wouldn't listen to him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> to back off. In his heart of hearts, Darren feels she's responsible for all of this". Fox revealed that she researched premature births, reading up on the subject and attending {{a meeting at the}} Liverpool Women's Hospital along with a writer for the serial. There, Fox spoke to a midwife who deals specifically with premature babies, which she found [...] "really helpful". The actress added that although the serial tried to stay true to life there is [...] "a bit of artistic licence that goes into the scripts, to make things more dramatic or to let the story flow better". On how Nancy would behave as a mother, Fox said: [...] "I imagine that she'll {{be a bit of a}} neurotic mother, particularly as the baby has arrived so early. I think she'd want to wrap him up in cotton wool and not let him out of her sight".|$|E
60|$|At breakfast {{the next}} morning Olive stopped pouring coffee <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> his {{plans to go to}} the sea.|$|E
60|$|And <b>when</b> <b>he</b> answered, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{recklessly}} that <b>he</b> had {{not been}} to see her because his best clothes were in pawn. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>he</b> had been sick, but was once more nearly well, and that inside ten days or two weeks (as soon as a letter could travel to New York City and return) he would redeem his clothes and be with her.|$|R
60|$|The air of {{the room}} chilled his shoulders. He {{stretched}} himself cautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife. One by one, they were all becoming shades. Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age. He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her heart {{for so many years}} that image of her lover's eyes <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>he</b> did not wish to live.|$|R
5000|$|President of the Planet (voiced by James Adomian) - the dog who {{rules the}} entire planet. He {{can be a}} noble person <b>when</b> <b>he</b> wants to be, but can also be quite brute and honest in his opinions, like <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> Goat that <b>her</b> superpower was {{complete}} garbage without a second thought in [...] "Super Space Meatball".|$|R
60|$|She {{was evidently}} much pleased, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of Mr. Glascow's gentlemanly conduct in the matter, her countenance {{instantly}} changed.|$|E
60|$|She made no answer, {{though the}} change in Frank's tone moved her; and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> his errand, that thought also passed from her mind.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{she grew}} deathly pale, {{and her lips}} even turned, yellow. she began to cry, hopelessly, quietly {{at first and then}} with choking sobs.|$|E
60|$|He was {{conscious}} of a marked increase in the exhilaration the starting of the expedition had brought to him. At {{the back of his}} mind he realized there had been all along a kind of wistful resentment at the change in this girl's manner toward him. During the brief conversation <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of his having secured his present situation, and later, only a few minutes back, on the platform of Paddington Station, he had sensed a coldness, a certain hostility--so different from her pleasant friendliness at their first meeting.|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of {{that little}} matter of Nell's birth, she had been silent a long minute, looking in his face, and then had said: [...] "Poor child! I wonder if SHE knows! People are so unkind, even nowadays!" [...] He could not himself think of anyone who would pay {{attention}} to such a thing, except to be kinder to the girl; but in such matters Sylvia was the better judge, in closer touch with general thought. She met people that he did not--and of a more normal species.|$|R
60|$|So Jude gave no sign. He {{would not}} call upon Sue just yet. He had other reasons against doing so <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had walked away. She seemed so dainty beside {{himself in his}} rough working-jacket and dusty {{trousers}} that {{he felt he was}} as yet unready to encounter her, as he had felt about Mr. Phillotson. And how possible it was that she had inherited the antipathies of her family, and would scorn him, as far as a Christian could, particularly <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that unpleasant part of his history which had resulted in his becoming enchained to one of her own sex whom she would certainly not admire.|$|R
