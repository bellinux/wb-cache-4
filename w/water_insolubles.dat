40|$|In this paper, we have {{investigated}} the possibilities to steer the composition and, thus, the quality of pyrolysis liquids by the reactor temperature and the pyrolysis vapor condenser temperature. Pine wood was pyrolyzed in a 1 kg/h fluidized-bed pyrolysis reactor operated at 330 or 480 °C. The pyrolysis vapors produced were condensed using a condenser train of two counter-current spray columns arranged in series. In this paper, {{the temperature of the}} first condenser was varied between 20 and 115 °C, while the second condenser temperature was kept at 20 °C. To describe the composition of the oils, we have integrated several analytical techniques into a novel characterization scheme that can account for 77 − 82 wt % of the oils. The effects of the condensation conditions on fractions of light compounds in the oils can be predicted with a simple equilibrium stage condensation model. It has been observed that pyrolysis at 330 °C gives a light oil with a low amount of mid-boilers [normal boiling point (nbp) of 150 − 300 °C] and heavy compounds (<b>water</b> <b>insolubles</b> and mono- and oligosugars). Sugars, mid-boilers, and water-insoluble lignin-derived oligomers are more present in the oil obtained at 480 °C, while the yields of light organics are approximately the same for 330 and 480 °C. It can be concluded that fractional condensation is a promising cheap downstream approach to concentrate compounds (classes) and, thus, to control the quality of pyrolysis oils. For instance, operating the first condenser around 70 − 90 °C gives an aqueous liquid in the second condenser containing 40 wt % light organics, which are interesting for extraction (e. g., 10 wt % acetic acid) and supercritical water gasification to produce hydrogen. Under these conditions, the oils from the first condenser have a high content of sugars (20 wt %) and lignin-derived oligomers (40 wt %), which are attractive fractions for fermentation/sugar chemistry and gasoline production via fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) /hydrotreatment, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Drug {{solubility}} {{has been}} a common limitation {{for the development of}} new drug formulations. Several mechanical and chemical approaches have been used in order to enhance the dissolution rate of <b>water</b> <b>insoluble</b> drugs, and consequently produce an increase of their bioavailability.

The main goal for this research was to explore whether this highly hydrophilic hydrogel can be effectively used as matrix to enhance the solubility of <b>water</b> <b>insoluble</b> drugs, and subsequently, determine the potential of the drug-hydrogel system as a vehicle for controlled release. A two-step method was developed for preparing the drug-hydrogel systems.

Dissolution tests showed that the incorporation of the drug in the hydrogel network modified the dissolution profiles.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Several {{attempts}} have been made to improve the solubility of <b>water</b> <b>insoluble</b> drugs. Over the years, inclusion complexation of drugs with β-cyclodextrin has emerged as a viable attempt to improve the dissolution of <b>water</b> <b>insoluble</b> drugs. The aim of the present work was to improve the dissolution rate of lovastatin, a <b>water</b> <b>insoluble</b> drug, by inclusion complexation with β-cyclodextrin. The stoichiometric ratio determined by phase solubility analysis for inclusion complexation of lovastatin with β-cyclodextrin was 1 : 1. The solubility of lovastatin increased with increasing amount of β-cyclodextrin in water. Gibbs free energy (∆Gtr°) values were all negative, indicating the spontaneous nature of lovastatin solubilization. Complexes of lovastatin were prepared with β-cyclodextrin by various methods such as kneading, coevaporation and physical mixing. The complexes were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. These studies indicated the inclusion of lovastatin in the cavity of β-cyclodextrin. The complexation resulted in a marked improvement in the solubility of lovastatin. The complex prepared by kneading method showed fastest and highest in vitro dissolution rate compared to the tablets of pure of lovastatin. Physical mixture of β-cyclodextrin/lovastatin also showed significant improvement in the dissolution rate compared to pure lovastatin. Mean dissolution time (MDT) of lovastatin decreased significantly after preparation of complexes and physical mixture of lovastatin with β-cyclodextrin. Similarity factor (f 2) indicated significant difference between the release profiles of lovastatin from complexes and from pure lovastatin.
