5|$|Some dealers {{included}} a software bundle called Smartbundle with the Classic. Also sold separately for $349, this included T/Maker's WriteNow <b>word</b> <b>processor,</b> Ashton-Tate's Full Impact spreadsheet program, RecordHolderPlus database, and Silicon Beach Software's SuperPaint 2.0 paint and draw program.|$|E
5|$|There were {{disk drive}} {{interfaces}}, {{such as the}} Abbeydale Designers/Watford Electronics SPDOS, Abbeydale Designers/Kempston KDOS and Opus Discovery. The SPDOS and KDOS interfaces {{were the first to}} come bundled with office productivity software (Tasword <b>Word</b> <b>Processor,</b> Masterfile database and Omnicalc spreadsheet). This bundle, together with OCP's Stock Control, Finance and Payroll systems, introduced small businesses to a streamlined, computerised operation. The most popular floppy disk systems (except in East Europe) were the DISCiPLE and +D systems released by Miles Gordon Technology in 1987 and 1988 respectively. Both systems had the ability to store memory images onto disk snapshots could later be used to restore the Spectrum to its exact previous state. They were both compatible with the Microdrive command syntax, which made porting existing software much simpler.|$|E
5|$|Through a {{completely}} random encounter Cayce meets Voytek Biroshak and Ngemi, the former an artist using old ZX81 microcomputers as a sculpture medium, the latter a collector of rare technology (he mentions purchasing Stephen King's <b>word</b> <b>processor,</b> for example). Another collector, and sometime 'friend' of Ngemi's, Hobbs Baranov, {{is a retired}} cryptographer and mathematician with connections in the American National Security Agency. Cayce strikes a deal with him: she buys a Curta calculator for him and he finds the email address to which the watermark code was sent. Using this email address Cayce makes contact with Stella Volkova whose sister Nora is the maker of the film clips.|$|E

25|$|MacWrite, Microsoft Word, {{and other}} word {{processing}} {{programs for the}} bit-mapped Apple Macintosh screen, introduced in 1984, were probably the first true WYSIWYG <b>word</b> <b>processors</b> to become known to many people until the introduction of Microsoft Windows. Dedicated <b>word</b> <b>processors</b> eventually became museum pieces.|$|R
50|$|Non-printing {{character}} or Formatting marks are characters for content designing in <b>word</b> <b>processors,</b> which aren't displayed at printing. It {{is also possible}} to customize their display on the monitor. The most common non-printable characters in <b>word</b> <b>processors</b> are pilcrow, space, non-breaking space, Tab character etc.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Microsoft began {{introducing}} {{its most}} prominent office products. Microsoft Works, an integrated office program which combined features typically {{found in a}} <b>word</b> <b>processor,</b> spreadsheet, database and other office applications, saw its first release as an application for the Apple Macintosh {{towards the end of}} 1986. Microsoft Works would later be sold with other Microsoft products including Microsoft Word and Microsoft Bookshelf, a reference collection introduced in 1987 that was the company's first CD-ROM product. Later, on August 8, 1989, Microsoft introduced its most successful office product, Microsoft Office. Unlike the model of Microsoft Works, Microsoft Office was a bundle of separate office productivity applications, such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel and so forth. While Microsoft Word and Microsoft Office were mostly developed internally, Microsoft also continued its trend of rebranding products from other companies, such as Microsoft SQL Server on January 13, 1988, a relational database management system for companies that was based on technology licensed from Sybase.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, Dorsey started Micom Data Systems and {{introduced}} the Micom 2000 <b>word</b> <b>processor.</b> The Micom 2000 improved on the AES design {{by using the}} Intel 8080 single-chip microprocessor, which made the <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> smaller, less costly to build and supported multiple languages.|$|E

5000|$|Desktop {{publishing}} tools or <b>word</b> <b>processors.</b> <b>Word</b> <b>processors</b> such as Scrivener, Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, and LibreOffice Writer {{are used}} by technical writers to author, edit, design, and print documents. Since technical writing {{is as much about}} the page's layout as it is the written language, Desktop Publishing tools such as Adobe FrameMaker and LyX are also used by Technical Writers. These programs function similarly to <b>word</b> <b>processors</b> but provide users with more options and features for the document's design and automate much of the formatting.|$|R
50|$|Alternative <b>word</b> <b>processors</b> {{included}} Superwriter and WordStar.|$|R
25|$|In 1981, Microsoft hired Charles Simonyi, {{the primary}} {{developer}} of Bravo, the first GUI <b>word</b> <b>processor,</b> which was developed at Xerox PARC. Simonyi started {{work on a}} <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> called Multi-Tool Word and soon hired Richard Brodie, a former Xerox intern, who became the primary software engineer.|$|E

25|$|In April 1983 Compute! {{published}} Scriptor, a <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> {{written by}} staff writer Charles Brannon in BASIC and assembly language, as a type-in {{program for the}} Atari 8-bit family. In January 1984 version 1.0 of his new <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> SpeedScript appeared in Compute!'s Gazette for the Commodore 64 and VIC-20. 1.1 appeared in Compute!'s Second Book of Commodore 64, 2.0 on Gazette Disk in May 1984, and 3.0 in Compute! in March and April 1985. Corrections that updated 3.0 to 3.1 appeared in May 1985, and the full version appeared in a book published by Compute!, SpeedScript: The <b>Word</b> <b>Processor</b> for the Commodore 64 and VIC-20. A 3.2 update appeared in the December 1985 Compute! and January 1986 Compute! Disk and again later in the May 1987 Compute!'s Gazette issue with three additional utilities.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a survey}} of five Macintosh <b>word</b> <b>processors,</b> Compute!'s Apple Applications in 1987 wrote that [...] "once a bold pioneer, MacWrite now seems frozen in time ... it lags behind other <b>word</b> <b>processors</b> in power and responsiveness, and it's clearly unsuited for outlining, layout, and other {{advanced}} tasks".|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{widespread}} use of <b>word</b> <b>processors,</b> bullets were often denoted either by a lowercase o filled in with ink or by asterisks (*); several <b>word</b> <b>processors</b> automatically convert asterisks to bullets if used at the start of line. This notation was inherited by Setext and wiki engines.|$|R

25|$|In July 2013, the VisualEditor editing {{interface}} was inaugurated, allowing {{users to}} edit Wikipedia using a WYSIWYG text editor (similar to a <b>word</b> <b>processor)</b> instead of wikimarkup. An editing interface optimised for mobile devices was also released.|$|E
50|$|The {{difficulty}} of resolving {{an instance of}} mojibake varies depending on the application within which it occurs and the causes of it. Two {{of the most common}} applications in which mojibake may occur are web browsers and <b>word</b> <b>processors.</b> Modern browsers and <b>word</b> <b>processors</b> often support a wide array of character encodings. Browsers often allow a user to change their rendering engine's encoding setting on the fly, while <b>word</b> <b>processors</b> allow the user to select the appropriate encoding when opening a file. It may take some trial and error for users to find the correct encoding.|$|R

50|$|The {{need for}} such {{programs}} arises from the presence of certain peculiarities in standard screenplay format which are not handled well by generic <b>word</b> <b>processors.</b> A good example would be the formatting and revision-tracking requirements of shooting scripts. The page-break constraints imposed by standard screenplay format are also difficult to implement using standard <b>word</b> <b>processors.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{market for}} {{standalone}} word processing systems collapsed {{with the introduction}} of the personal computer. MultiMate on the IBM PC replicated the interface and functions of the Wang <b>word</b> <b>processor,</b> and several other WYSIWYG word processing programs also became popular.|$|E
25|$|Later desktop {{publishing}} programs were specifically designed with elaborate pre-formatted layouts for publication, offering only limited options {{for changing the}} layout, while allowing users to import text that was written using a text editor or <b>word</b> <b>processor,</b> or type the text in themselves.|$|E
25|$|The Wang word {{processing}} software was also very graphical. The keyboard had 16 function-keys and, unlike WordStar, the popular <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> of the day, control key combinations {{were not required to}} navigate the system. The f-keys had the {{word processing}} functions labeled on them.|$|E
