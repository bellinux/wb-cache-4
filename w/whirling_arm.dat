50|$|<b>Whirling</b> <b>Arms</b> and <b>Whirling</b> Hands {{are the two}} {{exercises}} in the Lee style of T'ai Chi Ch'uan which are used to teach basic principles of self-defence.Like I fou shou, <b>Whirling</b> <b>Arms</b> (Lun Pei) and Whirling Hands (Lun Shou) encourage the development of quick mental and physical reactions and {{a high level of}} sensitivity. Both are characterized, as their names suggest, by circular movements of the arms and hands.The two arts include techniques to ward off, parry and deflect thrusts which may be made towards your body, and with constant practise you can develop the ability to recognize your partner's intentions before they are carried out. You will learn how to feel and exploit the weaknesses in their movements and postures, and in so doing you will come to understand your own weaknesses and develop greater concentration and awareness. You will build the foundations for a stronger balance, learn how to synchronize your body movements, and become much more sensitive and perceptive. In addition to all these, the control and utilization of your Ch'i energy plays a very big part in your practise.|$|R

He threw himself upon the negro, and struck him again and again, feebly but viciously, in his broad, black face. He hit like a girl, round arm, with an open palm. The man winced away for an instant, appalled by this sudden blaze of passion. Then with an impatient, snarling cry he slid a knife from his long loose sleeve and struck upwards under the <b>whirling</b> <b>arm.</b> Brown {{sat down at the}} blow and began to cough--to cough as a man coughs who has choked at dinner, furiously, ceaselessly, spasm after spasm.

60|$|What had {{happened}} was this. In his conflict {{with his own}} ill-humour, Cochrane had strolled over this nearest crest, and had found a group of camels in the hollow beyond, with a little knot of angry, loud-voiced men beside them. Brown was {{the centre of the}} group, pale, heavy-eyed, with his upturned, spiky moustache and listless manner. They had searched his pockets before, but now they were determined to tear off all his clothes in the hope of finding something which he had secreted. A hideous negro with silver bangles in his ears, grinned and jabbered in the young diplomatist's impassive face. There seemed to the Colonel to be something heroic and almost inhuman in that white calm, and those abstracted eyes. His coat was already open, and the Negro's great black paw flew up to his neck and tore his shirt down to the waist. And at the sound of that r-r-rip, and at the abhorrent touch of those coarse fingers, this man about town, this finished product of the nineteenth century, dropped his life-traditions and became a savage facing a savage. His face flushed, his lips curled back, he chattered his teeth like an ape, and his eyes--those indolent eyes which had always twinkled so placidly--were gorged and frantic. He threw himself upon the negro, and struck him again and again, feebly but viciously, in his broad, black face. He hit like a girl, round arm, with an open palm.

Then the angry red cheeks turned to a mottled pallor, there were liquid sounds in his throat, and, clapping his hand to his mouth, he rolled over on to his side. The negro, with a brutal grunt of contempt, slid his knife up his sleeve once more, while the Colonel, frantic with impotent anger, was seized by the bystanders, and dragged, raving with fury, back to his forlorn party. His hands were lashed with a camel-halter, and he lay at last, in bitter silence, beside the delirious Nonconformist.|$|E

60|$|Gertrude {{laid down}} her book and glanced about. She {{was of a}} {{practical}} disposition and almost devoid of artistic susceptibilities, but the richness and color of the scene impressed her. Far away in front ran the long ranks of sheaves, gleaming in the sunshine amid the golden stubble which was flecked by their deep-blue shadows. The air was cooling, but the light was brilliant and the standing wheat was picked out with tints of burnished copper. By comparison with it, the oat stocks shone pale and silvery. Round {{the edge of the}} grain moved the binders, clashing and tinkling musically, while their <b>whirling</b> <b>arms</b> flashed in the sunlight.|$|R
60|$|The next instant, the {{man behind}} him saw him reel and topple from the saddle as the <b>whirling</b> <b>arms</b> came round. He pulled his team up, and, jumping down, ran as for his life; but, most fortunately, Leland's tired horses had stopped {{of their own accord}} in a pace or two, for, when the other man came up, their driver lay partly across the knife-sheath with his feet among the wheat. What could be seen of his face was darkly flushed, while the sleeve and breast of his dusty shirt were smeared with {{trickling}} red. The other man, startled as he was, had, however, sense enough to seize the near horse's head before he shouted to his comrades.|$|R

50|$|He {{introduced}} {{the use of}} the <b>whirling</b> <b>arm</b> test rig to investigate the aerodynamics of flight, using it to discover the benefits of the curved or cambered aerofoil over the flat wing he had used for his first glider. He also identified and described the importance of dihedral, diagonal bracing and drag reduction, and contributed to the understanding and design of ornithopters and parachutes.|$|E
50|$|Cayley's next {{innovations}} were twofold: {{the adoption}} of the <b>whirling</b> <b>arm</b> test rig, invented in the previous century by Benjamin Robbins to investigate aerodynamic drag and used soon after by John Smeaton to measure the forces on rotating windmill blades, for use in aircraft research together with the use of aerodynamic models on the arm, rather than attempting to fly a model of a complete design. He initially used a simple flat plane fixed to the arm and inclined at an angle to the airflow.|$|E
50|$|About 1885 Montgomery began a {{long series}} of {{experiments}} with a <b>whirling</b> <b>arm</b> device, a smoke chamber, a water current table and large wooden surfaces angled into the wind {{in order to understand the}} physics of flow around curved surfaces. He also used dried bird wings placed in wind currents to observe the effect. His work in the 1880s confirmed that mechanical systems used by a pilot could preserve lateral balance and some degree of equilibrium in gliding flight. His experiments also confirmed the value of a cambered surface for obtaining lift.|$|E

5000|$|Maxim's {{father had}} earlier {{conceived}} {{of a helicopter}} powered by two counter-rotating rotors, {{but was unable to}} find a powerful enough engine to build it. Hiram first sketched out plans for a helicopter in 1872, but when he built his first [...] "flying machine" [...] he chose to use wings. Before starting design work, he carried out a series of experiments on aerofoil sections and propeller design, at first using a wind tunnel and later building a <b>whirling</b> <b>arm</b> test rig. Construction started in 1889 of a 40 ft craft with a 110 ft wingspan that weighed 3.5 tons, powered by two lightweight naptha-fired [...] steam engines driving two 17 ft laminated pine propellers.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the lift}} and the drag forces, [...] and [...] are scaled {{by the same}} factor to get [...] and , [...] = [...] As [...] and [...] are at right angles, the latter {{parallel}} to the free stream velocity or relative velocity of the surrounding, distant, air, the resultant force [...] lies at the same angle to that direction as the line from {{the origin of the}} polar plot to the corresponding , [...] point does to the [...] axis. If, in a wind tunnel or <b>whirling</b> <b>arm</b> system an aerodynamic surface is held at a fixed angle of attack and both the magnitude and direction of the resulting force measured, they can be plotted using polar coordinates. When this measurement is repeated at different angles of attack the drag polar is obtained. Lift and drag data was gathered in this way in the 1880s by Otto Lilienthal and around 1910 by Gustav Eiffel, though not presented in terms of the more recent coefficients. Eiffel was the first to use the name drag polar.|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenology}} was studied of {{the processes}} of vortex formation and transport in the near wake, at a Reynolds number sufficiently high to insure a fully turbulent wake, but low enough to insure a laminar separation. The apparatus developed for measuring this flow consisted of X-array hot wire probes mounted {{on the ends of}} a pair of <b>whirling</b> <b>arms.</b> A computer controlled data acquisition system was slaved to the position of the rotating arm and managed, monitored, edited, and recorded the vast profusion of data which is continuously poured out by the device. Results are presented which show the instantaneous velocity, intermittency, vorticity, and stress fields as a function of phase for the first six diameters of the near wake. The stresses in the near wake emerge as a concatenation of peaks and valleys, some the result of strong induced motions in the outer flow which cause free stream fluid to move rapidly inward {{toward the center of the}} wake, others the result of the random motions of the background turbulence...|$|R
40|$|Attention {{is given}} to an {{experimental}} investigation of transport processes in the near wake of a circular cylinder, for a Reynolds number of 140, 000, in which an X-array of hot wire probes mounted {{on a pair of}} <b>whirling</b> <b>arms</b> was used for flow measurement. Rotation of the arms in a uniform flow applies a wide range of relative flow angles to these X-arrays, making them inherently self-calibrating in pitch. A phase signal synchronized with the vortex-shedding process allowed a sorting of the velocity data into 16 populations, each having essentially constant phase. An ensemble average for each population yielded a sequence of pictures of the instantaneous mean flow field in which the vortices are frozen, as they would be on a photograph. The measurements also yield nonsteady mean data for velocity, intermittency, vorticity, stress, and turbulent energy production, as a function of phase. Emphasis is given in a discussion of study results to the nonsteady mean flow, which emerges as a pattern of centers and saddles in a frame of reference that moves with the eddies. The kinematics of the vortex formation process are described in terms of the formation and evolution of saddle points between vortices in the first few diameters of the near wake...|$|R
5000|$|Sir Hiram Maxim was an American {{who moved}} to England and changed his nationality. He chose to largely ignore his contemporaries and built his own <b>whirling</b> <b>arm</b> rig and wind tunnel. From the late 1890s he made many {{experiments}} and developed a biplane design which he patented in 1891 and completed as a test rig three years later. It was an enormous machine for its day with a wingspan of 105 ft, a length of 145 ft, fore and aft horizontal surfaces and a crew of three. Twin propellers were powered by two lightweight compound steam engines each delivering [...] Overall weight was 7000 lb. Later modifications would add more wing surfaces {{as shown in the}} illustration. Its purpose was for research and it was neither aerodynamically stable nor controllable, so it ran on a 1800 ft track with a second set of restraining rails to prevent it from lifting off, somewhat {{in the manner of a}} roller coaster. In 1894, the machine developed enough lift to take off, breaking one of the restraining rails and being damaged in the process. Maxim then abandoned work on it, but would return to aeronautics in the 20th century to test a number of smaller designs powered by internal combustion engines.|$|E
5000|$|In 1890 the French {{engineer}} Clément Ader {{completed the}} first of three steam-driven flying machines, the Éole. On October 9, 1890 Ader made an uncontrolled hop of around 50 m (165 ft); this was the first manned airplane to take off under its own power. [...] His Avion III of 1897, notable only for having twin steam engines, failed to fly: Ader would later claim success and was not debunked until 1910 when the French Army published its report on his attempt.Sir Hiram Maxim was an American engineer who had moved to England.

It was intended as a test rig to investigate aerodynamic lift: lacking flight controls it ran on rails, with a second set of rails above the wheels to restrain it. Completed in 1894, on its third run it broke from the rail, became airborne for several hundred feet at two to three feet altitude and was badly damaged upon falling back to the ground. It was subsequently repaired, but Maxim abandoned his experiments shortly afterwards.|$|E

40|$|When {{a vehicle}} travels through a corner it can {{experience}} {{a significant change}} in aerodynamic performance due to the curved path of its motion. The yaw angle of the flow will vary along its length and the relative velocity of the flow will increase with distance from the central axis of its rotation. Aerodynamic analysis of vehicles in the cornering condition is an important design parameter, particularly in motorsport. Most racing-cars are designed to produce downforce that will compromise straight-line speed to allow large gains {{to be made in the}} corners. Despite the cornering condition being important, aerodynamicists are restricted in their ability to replicate the condition experimentally. <b>Whirling</b> <b>arms,</b> rotary rigs, curved test sections and bent wind tunnel models are experimental techniques capable of replicating some aspects of the cornering condition, but are all compromised solutions. Numerical simulation is not limited in the same way and permits investigation into the condition. However, cornering introduces significant change to the flowfield and this must be accommodated for in several ways. Boundary conditions are required to be adapted to allow for the curved flow occurring within a non-inertial reference frame. In addition, drag begins to act in a curved path and variation in Re occurs within the domain. Results highlight the importance of using correct analysis techniques when evaluating aerodynamic performance for cornering vehicles. 9 page(s...|$|R
