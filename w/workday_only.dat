50|$|Miners in Colorado {{particularly}} {{resented the}} lack of an 8-hour work day. The legislature had passed a bill for a mandatory 8-hour <b>workday,</b> <b>only</b> to have the courts declare that it violated the US constitution. A second bill was passed, modeled after a Utah 8-hour bill that survived a US Supreme Court challenge, but the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that the second bill violated the state constitution. A ballot measure to establish the 8-hour day by amending the state constitution passed overwhelmingly in November 1902, but the Republican-controlled legislature meeting in 1903 refused to pass enabling legislation. Blocked politically, the WFM made it a priority to win the 8-hour day for its Colorado members through collective bargaining.|$|E

30|$|Departing {{from the}} {{traditional}} image of an authoritative figure in the family, the fathers in this study had shifted from rule enforcers to playmates with their children, spending quality time and having fun. Being a playmate indicates an important feature of the “new fathers,” a paternal ideal that has emerged in recent years. Unlike authoritative father figures, “new fathers” are more involved in childrearing and engage in face-to-face interactions and emotional communication with their children (Wang 2014; Lamb 2000). However, among the interviewed families, fathers had limited {{time to spend with}} their children. On <b>workdays,</b> <b>only</b> two of the 13 fathers spent more than an hour with their children; the father-child quality time took place mainly on weekends or holidays. Not all fathers were like Meimei’s father who reserved his weekends for the family; quite a few of them gave priority to their work and joined other family members on weekend activities only when {{they did not have to}} work overtime.|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{reduction}} campaigns since 1986 {{were based}} on the estimation that individuals get 80 % of their cumulative lifetime UV dose by the age of 18. To investigate if this estimation is true, we compared annual UV doses received during life in 164 Danish volunteers: children, teenagers, indoor workers, and golfers (age range 4 – 67 y) who recorded sun exposure behavior in diaries and carried personal UV dosimeters, measuring time-stamped UV doses. The annual UV dose did not significantly correlate with age but the variation in annual UV dose was high (median 166 SED (standard erythema dose), 95 % range: 37 – 551 SED). The annual UV dose did correlate with days with risk behavior (sunbathing/exposing upper body) (r= 0. 51, p< 0. 001) and in adults also with hours performing outdoor sports (r= 0. 39, p< 0. 001), gardening, and sun-bed sessions (r= 0. 26, p= 0. 02). Teenagers had significantly more days with risk behavior than adults (21 vs 13 d, p= 0. 006) but not than children (15 d). No differences in UV dose among the age groups were found on <b>workdays.</b> <b>Only</b> 25 % of the lifetime UV dose was received before the age of 20 and the annual UV dose was thus independent of age. Reduction of cumulative lifetime UV dose could be obtained by minimizing risk behavior...|$|R
50|$|Until {{the late}} 1970s, there were long-distance trains on the Lahn Valley Railway, {{including}} {{a pair of}} express trains to and from Trier to Westerland. Some timetables had an express train on the Paris-Trier-Koblenz route, continuing on the Lahn valley line to Gießen. The Dortmund-Bad Ems through coach of the Koblenz-Limburg-Frankfurt express, which had been very popular with spa guests had been discontinued. The Koblenz-Gießen express was extended {{several times a day}} via the Vogelsberg Railway to Fulda. A curiosity was the Frankfurt-Cologne express, which ran between Weilburg and Limburg on the Lahn Valley Railway <b>only</b> on <b>workdays</b> and <b>only</b> in one direction.|$|R

40|$|Objectives This study {{examined}} {{the degree to which}} long workhours in combination with an extended workweek (12 hours/ 7 days) with permanent day shifts (0700 - 1900), as requested by the workers, influenced biomarkers for stress, metabolic processes, and diurnal rhythm. Methods Construction workers (N= 50) working 84 hours a week, with alternate weeks off, were compared with construction workers (N= 25) having a traditional 40 -hour work schedule. The participants were all male and between the ages of 21 to 65 years. Blood samples were obtained in the morning immediately {{prior to the start of}} work on workday 1, 5, and 7 to assess cholesterol, cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, melatonin, prolactin, testosterone, and uric acid. Psychosocial circumstances were assessed with a questionnaire. Results The 84 -hour group had higher melatonin concentrations and reported higher job-control scores than the 40 -hour group. For both groups, the melatonin, cortisol, and cholesterol concentrations were lower on workday 5 than on workday 1. In the 84 -hour group, most of the biomarkers were significantly lower in concentrations on workday 7 than on <b>workday</b> 1. <b>Only</b> testosterone showed a significant decrease between workdays 5 and 7. The concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone and uric acid remained stable across all of the days, as did the melatonin concentrations between workdays 5 and 7. Conclusions Working of one's own freewill on an 84 -hour regimen is not, in the short-term, necessarily more harmful for health than working on a 40 -hour regimen with a similar type of heavy worktasks. However, working on an 84 -hour schedule beyond the ordinary 40 -hour week results in signs of a functional shift in hormonal regulation...|$|R
40|$|According to the U. S. Supreme Court’s recent {{decision}} in IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, walking {{that takes place}} during the <b>workday</b> may not <b>only</b> be good for employees’ health, but may also be good for their paychecks as any time employees spend walking after the donning of and prior to the doffing of required safety equipment must now be compensated under the Fair Labor Standards Act. While {{this is good news}} for employees, it is not good news to numerous employers for a several reasons. Based on the Supreme Court’s decision, employers are likely to face increases in liability and expenditures; increases in expenditures are most likely to take the form of litigation, labor, and restructuring costs, and will also include costs associated with implementing new workplace rules and policies regarding the donning and doffing of protective equipment and any related walking, and new timekeeping policies. Additionally, while not employer-specific problems, the application of the decision to the reality of the workplace creates opportunities for different compensation treatment of relatively similarly situated employees...|$|R
40|$|Urine {{samples were}} {{collected}} from 152 workers (64 men, 88 women) who {{had been exposed to}} benzene, 53 workers (men only) exposed to a mixture of benzene and toluene, and 213 non-exposed controls (113 men, 100 women). The samples were analysed for 1, 2, 4 -benzentriol (a minor metabolite of benzene) by high performance liquid chromatography. The time weighted average solvent exposure of each worker was monitored by diffusive sampling technique. The urinary concentration of 1, 2, 4 -benzentriol related linearly to the intensity of exposure to benzene both in men and women among workers exposed to benzene, and was suppressed by toluene co-exposure among male workers exposed to a mixture of benzene and toluene. A cross sectional balance study in men {{at the end of the}} shift of a <b>workday</b> showed that <b>only</b> 0. 47 % of benzene absorbed will be excreted into urine as 1, 2, 4 -benzenetriol, in close agreement with previous results in rabbits fed benzene. The concentration of 1, 2, 4 -benzenetriol in urine was more closely related to the concentration of quinol than that of catechol. The fact that phenol and quinol, but not catechol, are precursors of 1, 2, 4 -benzentriol in urine was further confirmed by the intraperitoneal injection of the three phenolic compounds to rats followed by urine analysis for 1, 2, 4 -benzenetriol...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePersonal RF exposimetry {{has been}} in the focus of the bioelectromagnetics {{community}} in the last few years. With a few exceptions, exposimetry studies focused on adults, because measuring the exposure of children, {{one of the most important}} target groups, introduces many complications. The main feature of our study is to select teachers and kindergarten caretakers as volunteers. They are expected to receive similar exposure patterns as the children because they spend the workday close to them. Thus they can stand as proxies for estimation of exposures of children. Volunteers belonging to one of two groups (elementary school teachers, n = 31; employees of kindergartens and day nurseries, n = 50) in Hungarian cities received a Personal Exposimeter (PEM) for 24 h each. <b>Only</b> <b>workdays,</b> when the volunteers worked near children, were considered. 51 additional volunteers (office workers) were measured as controls. The volunteers wore the PEMs on their bodies. Those activities marked in the exposure diaries as work were further classified into 5 categories based on the level of certainty that they actually worked near children during that activity. Subsets of the full dataset were derived and compared based on this categorization. It was found that relaxation of the selection criteria often under- or overestimates exposure. The differences of estimation depend on the frequency band and sub-population: the kindergarten and teacher groups differ in this regard. For most frequency bands the majority of data points was below the detection limit. Derived child exposures are comparable to the worktime exposure of adults (control group) ...|$|R
40|$|On-street {{occupancy}} (legal or illegal) makes {{a substantial}} {{fraction of the}} traffic flow {{in many developing countries}} like Dhaka City of Bangladesh and is often the source of localized traffic congestion due to road capacity reduction. In developing countries, especially, illegal occupancy is prevalent. However, little has been done in literature to incorporate the influence of such occupancy on traffic performance. This study therefore attempts to fill in this gap. To the authors 2 ̆ 7 best knowledge, this is the first attempt in developing countries. Taking Dhaka City as an example, this study first conducted a probe vehicle survey to collect the information about travel time {{over the course of a}} day (<b>only</b> <b>workdays),</b> which is divided into four time periods (different between Ramadan and non-Ramadan periods), in August and September, 2009. At the same time, on-street occupancy was also counted with respect to each time period. As a result, 30 road sections (links) at Dhaka City Corporation area were selected randomly over the city considering main corridor. Next, using the collected data as well as relevant data from secondary sources, this paper developed new link performance functions that recommend the updated volume - delay relationships by incorporating the influence of on-street occupancy. The functions were estimated for both peak and off-peak hours, and several other types of functions were also estimated for comparisons, where a constrained non-linear regression method was used for the estimation. Empirical studies statistically confirm the effectiveness of the proposed link performance functions. Finally, it is found that completely eliminating on-street occupancy could shorten travel time by more than 20...|$|R
50|$|In early systems, digital masking {{generators}} had noticeable {{short term}} levels changes; the cycle time was so short {{that the same}} sound was created repetitively. As a result, some specifications required temporal uniformity in the short term. This problem was bypassed with the requirement for use of analog generators that created truly random sound. The problem has been designed away so almost all masking generators now create a digital signal {{that can only be}} interpreted by a listener as random. Now, masking sound in the short term has a constant level. The same is not true for longer periods. The privacy needs of occupants vary throughout the <b>workday</b> and the <b>only</b> variable that can accommodate this is sound masking. During hours with high activity levels, the person would need more masking to maintain his or her privacy. At low activity levels, such as early evening hours, the person would like {{to be aware of the}} presence of others; the need for community partially outweighs the need for privacy, so masking levels need to be lower. If the building has roving security personnel after working hours, there is no need for privacy and the sound masking level should be minimized. Successful systems have a clock and a control function that will continually vary the masking level in small increments over twenty four hours and for each day of the week. There are two types. One in which the level variations are programmed in advance and one in which the actual activity sound levels are measured and the masking level is set automatically to create the needed privacy. See the programmed level control and the adaptive function listed above. Unsuccessful systems had an ON-OFF clock-controlled switch which is not recommended.|$|R
