5|$|The lack of {{a passing}} loop {{suitable}} for passenger trains on the Amlwch line meant that trains could only operate every two hours. Coordinating this limited timetable with the main line services through Gaerwen was difficult, and passengers could face a long wait on occasions. To make the branch line workings more flexible, a passing loop was proposed for Llangwyllog in March 1914. The work was completed for the summer timetables. This required introducing a new <b>working</b> <b>section,</b> and Llangwyllog became a staff station. As the new section {{was in the middle}} of a line, a third type of staff was required (a C configuration); one of only a few sections on the LNWR that did not use a type A or B staff.|$|E

As of 2010, only six confirmed roan Finnhorses exist, all descendants of a 1987 mare, Taika-Tyttö, great-great-granddaughter of Sonja.

40|$|The {{subject matter}} of the article is the energy and {{resource}} efficiency of tribological engineering methods applied to <b>working</b> <b>sections</b> and interfaces of construction machines and equipment exposed to varied temperature and loading conditions. The relevance of the problem is based on the need to increase the durability of <b>working</b> <b>sections</b> exposed to intensive wear and tear, to improve the productivity and to reduce the material and power expenses associated with the maintenance and repair of the above items of machinery. The solution is based on tribology-related achievements. Effective tribological methods include surface cladding and spraying of wear-resistant materials onto the wear surface, induction brazing of reinforcing hard alloys, thermal and chemicothermal treatment, etc. The most effective is an integrated structural and surface-treatment method. The resource efficiency of tribological methods is based on their energy efficiency at the stages of manufacturing and operation. Extension of the service life of products shouldn't increase the energy consumption rate. The latter is estimated {{with the help of the}} efficiency factor of tribological systems. The authors propose a new deformation and topography-related method of identification of the efficiency factor of rubbing elements. It encompasses multiple friction and wear models...|$|R
500|$|The Finnhorse stud {{book was}} created in 1907. Today it has four sections: the <b>Working</b> <b>section</b> (T; draught type), Trotter section (J), Riding section (R) and Pony-sized section (P) In 1924, the first split in the stud book was created, with the working or draught type (...) horses in one section, and the [...] "all-around" [...] or [...] "universal" [...] lighter {{trotting}} horses in another. In 1965, this all-around section was renamed the trotter section. Then, in 1971, this lighter horse section was divided into three parts: the trotter (...) , riding (...) and pony-sized (...) types. Today, the majority of Finnhorses are of trotter type.|$|E
500|$|According to ethnologist Kustaa Vilkuna's estimations, {{calculated}} from measurements of horse collars used in Finland {{in the early}} 18thcentury, the average peasant's horse was about [...] tall, while some horses employed by manors were larger, sometimes more than [...] tall. Vilkuna also discovered that the horses of the southern and western regions of Finland were larger {{than those of the}} northern and eastern regions. This was probably due to the influence of imported horses. By the mid-18thcentury, a typical Finnish horse was probably about , about the same size as a small contemporary Finnhorse yearling, and weighed about , roughly half the weight of a contemporary [...] <b>working</b> <b>section</b> horse. A civilian horse of good quality had good action and was swift. However, leg faults were common.|$|E
500|$|The {{working or}} draught type {{is the oldest}} of the Finnhorse types, and has had its own {{separate}} breeding section since the studbook was first split in 1924. Though {{the oldest of the}} Finnhorse types, it is rare today, with a total of only about 1,000 horses registered in the <b>working</b> <b>section</b> as of 2004. Draught-type Finnhorses are heavier and have a longer body than horses of the trotter and riding types. Though relatively small compared to other draught breeds, Finnhorses have considerable pulling power and can pull very heavy loads because of the breed's good pulling technique, with powerful take-off and a low, efficient body stature during the actual pulling. The Finnish Draught type is, pound for pound, stronger than many larger draught breeds. An average [...] horse in draught work is capable of pulling about 80percent of its own weight, while a Finnhorse can pull as much as 110percent. In work horse competitions, the best Finnhorses can achieve even higher results, pulling more than 200percent of their own body weight.|$|E
