5|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues amongst islanders {{in the 21st century}} is <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> rodent situation. Rodents have only been on the island since a ship ran aground in 1918 and have wiped out several endemic bird species and were thought to have done the same to the Lord Howe Island stick insect. There is a plan to drop 42 tonnes of rat bait across the island but the community is heavily divided.|$|E
25|$|In April 1970, {{a general}} {{election}} was held with the Rhodesian Front easily winning. Ian Smith portrayed his government as not being racialist, and sought to postpone the question of <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> problems in the farming industry until after the election. Indeed, {{he was able to}} do so because more radical and more racist parties had at that time been formed and stood in the election.|$|E
25|$|Roddenberry became {{concerned}} at {{the concentration of}} the fanbase on Spock and not Kirk. He wrote to his friend, noted science fiction writer Isaac Asimov for advice on <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> situation. They corresponded several times on the subject, and Asimov suggested several ideas to enhance Kirk's popularity. These included placing the character in disguises to make Kirk seem more fun, or to create situations where Spock must save Kirk's life to demonstrate who the more important character was.|$|E

25|$|From the {{beginning}} of his term, Bush faced the problem of <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> federal budget debt. At $2.8trillion in 1990, the deficit had grown to three times larger than it was in 1980. Bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit, believing that America could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so. He began an effort to persuade the Democratic controlled Congress to act on the budget; with Republicans believing that the best way was to cut government spending, and Democrats convinced that the only way would be to raise taxes, consensus building proved difficult.|$|E
25|$|The {{incomplete}} {{success in}} stopping inflation created an extremely difficult policy conflict. Recovery could in principle be stimulated by more expansionary credit policies and lower interest rates, which would favor increased investment, depreciation {{of the currency}} to help producers compete against imports, and improved exports. But continuing inflation {{and the fear of}} accelerating its rate of increase argued instead for keeping a very tight rein on credit and thereby blocked the actions needed for recovery. This conflict became particularly acute over the question of <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> exchange note: the real exchange rate went in exactly the wrong direction for recovery by appreciating when depreciation was both expected and needed.|$|E
25|$|Before the 2004-2005 {{academic}} year, a few schools, {{most notably}} Trace Crossings Elementary, had almost, {{if not more}} than, 1,000 students, resulting {{in the building of}} Riverchase Elementary. After that, the case of overcrowding was resolved, with many students moving to the new school. However, a similar case has occurred with Bumpus Middle School, resulting in meetings at multiple district schools to discuss <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> case. For the 2011-2012 academic year, Bumpus Middle School and its students were moved to the former freshman center of Hoover High School, and the old Bumpus site became Brock's Gap Intermediate School, which serves 5th and 6th graders. Bumpus Middle School now serves 7th and 8th graders.|$|E

25|$|The 7th Cavalry, Custer commanding, {{departed}} from Fort Abraham Lincoln on May 17, 1876, {{part of a}} larger army force planning to round up remaining free Indians. Meanwhile, {{in the spring and summer}} of 1876, the Hunkpapa Lakota holy man Sitting Bull had called together the largest ever gathering of Plains Indians at Ash Creek, Montana (later moved to the Little Bighorn River) to discuss <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> whites. It was this united encampment of Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho Indians that the 7th met at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in the Crow Indian Reservation created in old Crow Country. (In the Fort Laramie Treaty (1851), the valley of the Little Bighorn is in the heart of the Crow Indian treaty territory and accepted as such by the Lakota, the Cheyenne and the Arapaho). The Lakotas were staying in the valley without consent from the Crow tribe, which sided with the Army to expel the Indian invaders.|$|E
25|$|The central concept {{around which}} this play is built is {{the dilemma of}} what to do with Harry and Edna. Their {{situation}} is the focal point for all the characters, including Harry and Edna themselves. Albee uses this dilemma to cause emotions to rise. As his characters try to figure out <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Harry and Edna, they have a series of discussions or debates that slowly rise in emotional temperature. Each character has his or her definition of what the dilemma is, as well as a means for resolving it. The tension in the play rises with the rise of emotions as the characters move toward a climax or a moment of truth. This moment is played out most specifically by Tobias and Harry in the conversation that defines their friendship: one that is built on rights and responsibilities rather than love and affection. In the end, Harry and Edna decide to go back home, thus solving, or at least releasing some of the tension of the dilemma.|$|E
25|$|The UNESCO Expert Working Group on Afghan {{cultural}} projects convened {{to discuss}} <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> two statues between 3–4 March 2011 in Paris. Researcher Erwin Emmerling of Technical University Munich announced {{he believed it}} would be possible to restore the smaller statue using an organic silicon compound. The Paris conference issued a list of 39 recommendations for the safeguarding of the Bamiyan site. These included leaving the larger Western niche empty as a monument to the destruction of the Buddhas, a feasibility study into the rebuilding of the Eastern Buddha, and the construction of a central museum and several smaller site museums. Work has since begun on restoring the Buddhas using the process of anastylosis, where original elements are combined with modern material. It is estimated that roughly half the pieces of the Buddhas can be put back together according to Bert Praxenthaler, a German art historian and sculptor involved in the restoration. The restoration of the caves and Buddhas has also involved training and employing local people as stone carvers. The project, which also aims to encourage tourism to the area, is being organised by UNESCO and the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS).|$|E

[...] With this goal in mind, Costa approached Worldwide Documentaries, an East Bloomfield, New York-based organization that had produced two films with which he was familiar: The Cry of Reason, which documents internal resistance to South African apartheid by way of Beyers Naudé's story; and A Closer Walk, which is about the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS. Costa e-mailed Bilheimer, Director of Worldwide Documentaries, asking him to create the film he envisioned.

500|$|On July 5, 1773, Boone {{packed up}} his family and, {{with a group}} of about 50 immigrants, began the first attempt by British colonists to {{establish}} a settlement in Kentucky. Boone was still an obscure hunter and trapper at the time; the most prominent member of the expedition was William Russell, a well-known Virginian and future brother-in-law of Patrick Henry. On October 9, Boone's eldest son James and a small group of men and boys who had left the main party to retrieve supplies were attacked by a band of Delawares, Shawnees, and Cherokees. Following the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, American Indians in the region had been debating <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> influx of settlers. This group had decided, in the words of historian John Mack Faragher, [...] "to send a message of their opposition to settlement". James Boone and William Russell's son Henry were captured and gruesomely tortured to death. The brutality of the killings sent shock waves along the frontier, and Boone's party abandoned its expedition.|$|E

500|$|The Suez Canal, {{opened in}} 1869, cut weeks and {{thousands}} of miles off the journey between Britain and India; in 1875, approximately 80% of the ships using the canal were British. In the event of another rebellion in India, or of a Russian invasion, the time saved at Suez might be crucial. [...] Built by French interests, much of the ownership and bonds in the canal remained in their hands, {{though some of the}} stock belonged to Isma'il Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt, who was noted for his profligate spending. The canal was losing money, and an attempt by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the canal, to raise the tolls had fallen through when the Khedive had threatened to use military force to prevent it, and had also attracted Disraeli's attention. The Khedive governed Egypt under the Ottoman Empire; as in the Crimea, the issue of the Canal raised the Eastern Question of <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> decaying empire governed from Constantinople. With much of the pre-canal trade and communications between Britain and India passing through the Ottoman Empire, Britain had done its best to prop up the Ottomans against the threat that Russia would take Constantinople, cutting those communications, and giving Russian ships unfettered access to the Mediterranean. The French might also threaten those lines from colonies in Syria. Britain had had the opportunity to purchase shares in the canal but had declined to do so.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is {{scheduled}} for an interleukin 2 (IL-2) treatment but is absent from the hospital. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) calls her, {{but she does not}} answer or come, so Karev cries to fellow resident Dr. Reed Adamson (Nora Zehetner). Shepherd spends ten hours in the operating room contemplating <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> tumor, with the motivational support of fellow surgeons Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), and Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez). Webber orders Shepherd to end the surgery because he is wasting hospital resources. Shortly thereafter, Isaac awakens to Shepherd explaining that the surgery {{would not have been possible}} without paralyzing him. Isaac convinces Shepherd to operate again in secret the next day, and the latter maps out a diagram of the surgery on his bedroom wall while discussing it with his wife Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), who is home on bed rest after donating part of her liver to her father in the episode [...] "Tainted Obligation". Backed by his fellow attendings, Shepherd obtains Webber's permission to cut the chord but tells Avery and Lexie that they were not cutting the chord and playing by ear instead. He removes all but a tiny section of the tumor. Webber discovers that Shepherd is operating and is about to put an end to it, but Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) tells him to go away. Shepherd has to cut a nerve to remove the rest of the tumor, but does not know which will result in paralysis. He decides with a game of [...] "Eeny, meeny, miny, moe", ultimately cutting the correct nerve and eliminating the entirety of the tumor. Despite the successful surgery, Webber is enraged and verbally fires Shepherd. Shepherd dismisses this in a light tone and goes home to drink champagne with his wife.|$|E
