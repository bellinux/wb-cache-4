50|$|Already in his youth, Pešta {{acquired}} an artistic dexterity and sense for material that he first applied in hyperrealistic painting. Nevertheless, he soon abandoned this approach {{in favor of}} a raw, expressive style more closely reflecting his nature. In 1998, Pešta went on his first study trip to New York. This contact with the international art scene radically influenced his work. He started to make use of diverse materials, experimenting with <b>wax,</b> <b>leather,</b> textiles, or recycled photographs as part of naturalistic assemblages. Since 2004, his favorite technique has been clear epoxy resin, which he uses to cover older paintings and objects, thus conserving and devaluating them all at once.Over time, he expanded his range of artistic approaches to include object installations, video art, and purely conceptual endeavors.|$|E

This consisted of a bird-like mask with spectacles, and a long leather (Moroccan or Levantine) or waxed-canvas gown which went from the neck to the ankle. The over-clothing garment, as well as leggings, gloves, boots, and a hat, were made of <b>waxed</b> <b>leather.</b> The garment was impregnated with similar fragrant items as the beak mask. The costume may have older roots as some authors have described fourteenth-century plague doctors as wearing bird-like masks.|$|R
40|$|As {{professionals}} {{working in}} museum and academic settings, {{many of you}} have probably found yourselves feeling at times like 2 ̆ 2 poor cousins 2 ̆ 2 [...] textiles simply do not garner the same prestige as other types of artifacts and art forms. I now find myself in a situation where I feel like an even poorer cousin: although I am involved with textiles of all kinds, I find myself particularly fascinated or compelled by a type of textile-related artifact that is rarely considered seriously, even by textile historians. I am speaking of fancywork, specifically of small items such as tidies, wallpockets, sewing cases, flowerpot covers, and penwipers. Such items continue to engage time and attention, even today, but were especially prevalent in the nineteenth century. Instructions for fancywork filled the pages of women 2 ̆ 7 s magazines and manuals, and 2 ̆ 2 fancy fairs, 2 ̆ 2 where the items were sold for fundraising purposes, were ubiquitous and profitable events. Fancywork once filled the Victorian parlor and boudoir, and fills the shelves of our museums today. The items are frequently dismissed as 2 ̆ 2 silly little things 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 useless 2 ̆ 2 time fillers [...] Geoffrey Warren, author of A Stitch in Time, even pronounced them a waste of intelligence and a sign of limited imagination (p. 16). Such contemporary judgements preclude real analysis, however, and do not take the items on their own terms. These sewn and stitched objects remain as nonverbal 2 ̆ 2 documents 2 ̆ 2 that tell us about the reality of the Victorian women who made them, and we must learn to read their expressive story. I will return to the objects themselves momentarily, but wish to begin with a consideration of terminology. No satisfactory definition of fancywork is available. Present-day dictionaries refer to it simply as decorative or ornamental needlework [...] it is contrasted with plain work — but there is no indication of boundary, no point where plain becomes fancy, and no delineation of technique or media. Today fancywork is often thought of as embroidery, knitting and crochet, but in nineteenth century usage the term was inclusive, and shell, <b>wax,</b> <b>leather</b> and even pine cone work was referred to the same way. Fancywork is an interesting term, one which is full of inherent contradictions, and captures the ambivalent Victorian attitude toward women and work. Women did of course work in actuality, but given the strong distinction and separation between the outside world of work and the inside world of the home, women were by definition not 2 ̆ 2 workers. 2 ̆ 2 Most of their tasks carried other names, but light, ornamental and non-pecuniary efforts — those that involved cloth and similar materials [...] were dubbed needlework or fancywork. 2 ̆ 7 Embroidery sections in the periodicals were called 2 ̆ 2 work sections, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 work departments, 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 work baskets. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Women 2 ̆ 7 s work 2 ̆ 2 displays at county fairs were filled with needlework rather than vegetables or other products of agricultural labor. The 2 ̆ 2 fancy 2 ̆ 2 part of the term, however, implies almost the opposite of work. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, a fancy is a fantasy or mental conception; it is synonymous with imagination. It is also a whim, a supposition resting on no solid ground; an entertainment; an invention; or something bred or manipulated into a more beautiful form (pp. 60 - 62) ...|$|E

40|$|Per- and polyfluorinated {{chemicals}} (PFC) have inimitable properties. They {{are very}} stable, e. g. {{are resistant to}} biotic and abiotic breakdown, and are water and grease repellent. Therefore, they are used in numerous industrial applications, such as in paper- and packaging as well as textile industry. The manufacture, use, and disposal of consumer products is an important source for exposure into the environment. The persistence of PFCs, however, is problematic for the environment. A number of PFCs can be fund ubiquitously in the environment. Findings in remote regions, in human blood and breast milk are of very high concern. The most frequently detected PFCs are perfluorooctansulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Both of these compounds are persistent, toxic and bioaccumulative. While the marketing and use of PFOS is prohibited with few exceptions in the EU since June 27, 2008 there is no substance specific regulation for PFOA. Available data on PFCs in consumer products are scarce to date. Hence, more data are {{needed in order to}} get an overview on recent PFC loads and to evaluate if these data implicate further measures against PFOA with respect to a regulation according to REACH. Therefore, the Federal Environment Agency of Germany initiated an analytical screening project in 2009. Perfluorinated sulfonic (C 4, C 6 -C 8, C 10 -PFSA) and carboxylic acids (C 4 -C 14 -PFCA) and fluorotelomer alcohols (4 : 2, 6 : 2; 8 : 2 and 10 : 2 FTOH) were analyzed in 118 consumer products including textiles (outdoor materials), carpets, cleaning and impregnating agents, leather samples, baking and sandwich papers, paper baking forms and ski waxes. PFCA and PFCA were analysed by LC-ESI-MS/MS, whereas FTOH were detected by GC-CI-MS. The results show that there are consumer products with low or negligible PFSA- and PFCA-contents, such as the cleaning agents or baking and sandwich papers tested. On the other hand, high PFC levels were identified in ski <b>waxes,</b> <b>leather</b> samples, outdoor textiles and some baking papers. Moreover, the PFOS concentrations in most of the leather and carpet samples as well as some textile samples tested exceeded the regulatory threshold value of 1 ?g/m 2 PFOS according to the European PFOS regulation...|$|R

Instead, local companies produced cables, wires, and thread and increased production of footwear, umbrellas, and parasols. The area's vineyards focused on sparkling wine and fruit was increasingly preserved for sale elsewhere. The area had also developed a small-scale textile industry and begun producing machines, as well as commercial-scale production of hemp and flowers.|$|R

The Gjakovar traders and craftsmen used to sell their product not only in Grand Bazaar, but also in many markets in other towns of Ottoman Empire, of Serbia and Austria. According to the facts, in the 1720s, the traders of Pristina and Gjakova transported their goods firstly to Dubrovnik and then to Italy. In 1803 the trader (merchant) from Gjakova, Jonuz Spahiu, had sold 114 bales of small leathers in Venice. In 1827 Salih Gjakova and Kërsto Gjakova sent gunpowder, rifles and flint stone to Sarajevo, whilst a year later, Hasan Gjakova and his nephew Hamza sent three bales of rifles to Serbia. According to the minutes of customs duty (cymryks) of Pozhega, of Aleksinac, of Kragujevac, of Mokra Gora, of Belgrade, etc., the traders from Gjakova sold their goods such as silk galloons, tobacco, rice, maize, eels, razors, soles, double-barrel sporting rifles, pistols, long rifles, cartridges, gunpowder, flint stones, <b>wax,</b> snuff, different <b>leathers,</b> salt, oil, cotton, cotton breast collars, cotton ribbons, silver galloons, scarfs, figs etc. Ali Sulejmani from Gjakova, in 1837, transported 56 loads of sheep leathers and other goods in an amount of 283.38 groshes, through Belgrade to Austria whereas in 1841, Halil Dobruna transported through Serbia to Austria galloons in an amount of 1800 groshes and 21,5 loads of Morocco leather (saftjan).|$|R
5000|$|Traditional {{masks are}} most {{commonly}} carved from wood, with various types used. The harvesting of this wood often falls under certain customs related to {{when and how}} the trees may be cut. The most common traditional wood is “zompantle” also called “palo bofo” or “colorín” (Erythrina coralloides) a plant of the legume family which yields a soft white wood often use for more artistic objects and {{has been associated with}} ritual since pre Hispanic times. It is never used to utilitarian items. Other common woods include red cedar and “ayacahuite” (Pinus ayacahuite), both favored for their ability to resist insect infestation. Red cedar masks are most commonly found in the Sierra de Puebla, Papantla area, Chiapa de Corzo and among the Zoques in Chiapas. Poplar wood is commonly used because it can be worked thin and does not splinter. Masks of this wood are most commonly found for the pascola dances of the Mayos and Yaquis. The hardest woods used for masks are mesquite and avocado. Mezquite masks are found in Hidalgo, Zacatecas and the northwest of the country, with avocado wood ones found in the State of Mexico. Copal wood in used mostly in Michoacán and Oaxaca but can be found in Sonora and other states.Other materials used for masks include <b>wax,</b> fired clay, <b>leather,</b> cloth, wire mesh, sheet metal, rubber tires, cardboard and paper mache.

Kachina dolls are objects meant to be treasured and studied in order to learn {{the characteristics of}} each Kachina. Inuit dolls are made out of soapstone and bone, materials common to the Inuit people. Many are clothed with animal fur or skin. Their clothing articulates the traditional style of dress necessary to survive cold winters, wind, and snow. The tea dolls of the Innu people were filled with tea for young girls to carry on long journeys. Apple dolls are traditional North American dolls with a head made from dried apples. In Inca mythology, Sara Mama was the goddess of grain. She was associated with maize that grew in multiples or was similarly strange. These strange plants were sometimes dressed as dolls of Sara Mama. Corn husk dolls are traditional Native American dolls made out of the dried leaves or husk of a corncob. Traditionally, {{they do not have a}} face. The making of corn husk dolls was adopted by early European settlers in the United States. Early settlers also made rag dolls and carved wooden dolls, called Pennywoods. La última muñeca, or [...] "the last doll", is a tradition of the Quinceañera, the celebration of a girl's fifteenth birthday in parts of Latin America. During this ritual the quinceañera relinquishes a doll from her childhood to signify that she is no longer in need of such a toy. In the United States, dollmaking became an industry in the 1860s, after the Civil War.Matryoshka dolls are traditional Russian dolls, consisting of a set of hollow wooden figures that open up and nest inside each other. They typically portray traditional peasants and the first set was carved and painted in 1890. In Germany, clay dolls have been documented as far back as the 13th century, and wooden doll making from the 15th century. Beginning about the 15th century, increasingly elaborate dolls were made for Nativity scene displays, chiefly in Italy. Dolls with detailed, fashionable clothes were sold in France in the 16th century, though their bodies were often crudely constructed. The German and Dutch peg wooden dolls were cheap and simply made and were popular toys for poorer children in Europe going back to the 16th century. Wood continued to be the dominant material for dolls in Europe until the 19th century. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, wood was increasingly combined with other materials, such as <b>leather,</b> <b>wax</b> and porcelain and the bodies made more articulate. It is unknown when dolls' glass eyes first appeared, but brown was the dominant eye color for dolls up until the Victorian era when blue eyes became more popular, inspired by Queen Victoria.Dolls, puppets and masks allow ordinary people to state what is impossible in the real situation; In Iran for example during Qajar era, people criticised the politics and social conditions of Ahmad-Shah's reign via puppetry without any fear of punishment. According to the Islamic rules, the act of dancing in public especially for women, is a taboo. But dolls or puppets have free and independent identities and are able to do what is not feasible for the real person. Layli (Lurish doll) is a hinged dancing doll, which is popular among the Lur people of Iran. The name Layli is originated from the middle east folklore and love story; Layla and MajnunLayli is the symbol of the beloved who is spiritually beautiful. Layli also represents and maintains a cultural tradition, which is gradually vanishing in urban life.|$|R
