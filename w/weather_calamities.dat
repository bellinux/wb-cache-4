40|$|What are the {{prospects}} for sustainable development over the next 20 years in Mozambique? Although {{it looks as if}} much of the development prospects are determined by such inherently unpredictable events as war, peace, and <b>weather</b> <b>calamities,</b> there are also many changes and patterns which have a long-term stability and which change only slowly over time. For example, socio-demographic changes, such as labor force skills, and population health have a long momentum. These are very important indicators for the economic development potential of a country. Also, although it is impossible to predict a particular year of heavy rains or droughts, there are long time series of weather from which we can calculate the country's vulnerability to single- or multiple-year weather disasters. To focus our efforts in answering this bold question, we concentrate on four issues: (1) Can poverty be erased in the next 20 years? (2) How will school enrollment lead to higher skills in the labor force by 2020 ? (3) What role will water play in development, in particular, water provision by rain to rural areas, and infrastructure to cities? (4) And, most importantly, what will be the impacts of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the next decades...|$|E
40|$|Insuring against {{bad weather}} Cue: Do {{you run a}} business? If so, what risks do you face? Maybe you fear that your goods might be stolen or damaged, or that you will lose your market to competitors. In some cases {{you may be able}} to get some {{financial}} protection by taking out an insurance policy. But what about farmers? Farmers face significant risks in growing and harvesting a crop: risk of pests and disease outbreaks, of drought or flooding, and risk that their crops may be damaged in storage or during transport. Is there anything you can do as a farmer to protect yourself? In Malawi, Opportunity International bank is offering a way for farmers to be insured against at least some risks. The bank is helping farmers to buy weather-linked crop-insurance policies. As a result, if crops fail because of bad weather, farmers automatically receive financial compensation for their losses. Bank employee Gift Livata explained more to Excello Zidana, about how Malawi is taking the lead in crop insurance for farmers. IN:	?The micro-insurance policies work? OUT:	?pioneer of this crop insurance. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 32 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Gift Livata of Opportunity International in Malawi, on a new type of crop insurance aimed at small-scale commercial farmers. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Livata	The micro-insurance policies work in the way that we link the farmers with the insurance companies. And we secure the crop that the farmers are growing from the risk of <b>weather</b> <b>calamities,</b> such as drought and floods and excess rainfall. Zidana	What kind of farmers have been asking for this insurance? I?m talking about the scale of the farmers. Are they commercial or subsistence? Which ones? Livata	Yes, the interest of the bank is on small-scale commercial farmers. Why we are interested in small-scale commercial farmers is that, what we give them is a loan. We give them a loan for inputs and also a loan for the insurance premiums. So the subsistence farmer might not be able to pay. But the smallholder commercial farmer, if they have a little of a cash crop plus a food crop, from the cash crop they should be able to pay back the loan. Zidana	Let us go straight to the issue now. Suppose I am a farmer and I?m growing five hectares of maize or let?s say groundnuts and I want to insure that against any risk. How can I go about the whole process? Livata	What you need to do is to come to the bank and apply for the loan. And once we approve your loan it means you directly access the crop insurance. But now beyond that of course there is a requirement that as a farmer, your farm should be close to a weather station. There must be a radius of not more than 30 kilometres from the weather station to your farm. If you are within this radius then you automatically qualify for this crop insurance. And once you qualify for the crop insurance there is no need for you to fill any form or to apply to the insurance companies. The rest of the job is done by the bank. Zidana	Now how does the bank verify the type of enterprise the farmers are involved in? Livata	We verify of course the enterprise that the farmer is doing. Basically most of the time we work in alliance with organisations that are able to provide technical services to the farmers. Because we don?t want the farmer to lose their crop because they lacked maybe some technical expertise. And in line with this we have also a unit within the bank that go and visit the farmers and make sure that they followed all the good agricultural practices. And thereafter there is no more verification that is needed. If they come with a claim to the bank we don?t need to verify anything because the farmers are within the area where rainfall is recorded. So every ten days the meteorological department provide us with data. And that data is detailed and we are able to see from which area there was a shortfall of rainfall and from which area there was maybe excess rainfall. And that rainfall that has fallen in a particular area is directly linked to the contract that the farmers are given. Zidana	What happens during lean years? Do you expect farmers to submit their claims? Livata	Basically we don?t expect farmers to come and submit their claims. This type of insurance is quite different from the traditional insurance that other organisations offer. The weather report that we receive automatically gives an indication of how much the stress the crop is under and how much the crop has suffered and that is translated to monetary value. So once we observe the data, even before the farmer thinks of coming to the bank and telling us what has happened in their field, we will already know what has happened in the field and we automatically give them what is due for them or the payout that they need to receive. Zidana	What is the response like from farmers? Livata	The response has been overwhelming. We started with about 500 farmers and the following year we had about 800 farmers, and this year we had over 1, 000 farmers. In the coming season we are recruiting 4, 000 farmers. So people are interested and they want to be recruited for this programme. Zidana	Do you have any record that this is also happening in other countries within the region? Livata	Malawi happens to be the pioneer of crop insurance. And of course recently there have been countries like South Africa, Angola and Kenya who want also roll out what we have been doing. But we have done it successfully and we also believe that they are also going to do it successfully. Beyond Africa I also know that it?s being done in Philippines. But here in Africa Malawi is the pioneer of this crop insurance. End of track.

40|$|Rice is {{a staple}} food in Asia and its prices at {{national}} and international levels are largely influenced by different policy actions of trading countries. The consequence of the 2008 food crisis was food riots and rationing of rice in many nations. The ASEAN Plus Three (APT) countries have adopted an institutional framework called ASEAN Plus Three Emergency Rice Reserves (APTERR) to address food security concerns of ASEAN countries that may arise due to climate change, supply chain disruptions or price speculation in the regional rice market. The RICEFLOW model is used to study {{the effectiveness of the}} strategic grain reserves to mitigate rising rice prices in case of <b>weather</b> related <b>calamities.</b> The objective of the study is to address price volatility in the Philippines and other ASEAN countries due to production shortfalls. The simulated results from the RICEFLOW model show that the APTERR stocks are ideal to address short term emergency situations like disaster relief during floods and typhoons but are not sufficient under current design to address extreme price volatility. With increased commitment by member nations {{to the size of the}} APTERR grain reserves can offer a policy leverage to reduce extreme price volatility if there is a production shortfall due to natural calamities or speculation in international rice market...|$|R

Have them place a check mark next to the words they are not sure of. Repeat after the reading, during which you highlight or emphasize the word and the context. See of they can find the meanings of the words from the usage and context. Have them look up the remaining words. History Connection: The Gift {{is the story of}} one child’s experience during the settlement of the prairie. A homesteading family had to be self-sufficient and cope with hardship, severe weather, and loneliness. Read other homesteading stories to your students. (See Bibliography) Have them make lists of: • things a family made instead of buying • what they did for entertainment • <b>weather</b> and natural <b>calamities</b> they faced • sources of food • means of transportation 2. WRITING Comparison: Show students how to write a comparison paper about the differences and similarities of the life of a child during the homesteading days (the settlement of the mid-west and west) and their life in modern times...|$|R
