5|$|During his {{military}} career he had blood vomits, such as before the Battle of Salta; he <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> ill {{to participate in}} the battle. It is thought that those vomits originated in the digestive system and were caused by stress, and not in the respiratory system, because the vomits were sporadic, the condition did not become chronic, and it eventually cured itself. Nothing was revealed in the autopsy.|$|E
5|$|In the UK in 2005, Lawson {{started to}} host a daytime {{television}} chat show on ITV1 called Nigella, on which celebrity guests joined her in a studio kitchen. The first episode debuted with a disappointing 800,000 viewers. The show was met with a largely negative critical reaction, and after losing 40% of its viewers in the first week, the show was cancelled. She later commented to Radio Times that on her first show, she <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> frightened {{to come out of}} her dressing room. Lawson added that having to pretend to be interested {{in the lives of the}} celebrities on her show became too much of an effort.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{largely the}} {{fighting}} went {{in favour of}} the Allies, and finally the Japanese assault ground to a halt. Despite forcing a contraction of the Australian forces defending the beachhead, on 21 October the Japanese withdrew from Siki Cove, although the fighting around Katika continued for four more days as the Japanese attempted to retake it. Fierce resistance from the 2/28th halted them and eventually the attack was called off on 24 October, with the Japanese having suffered heavily due to tactical deficiencies, poor co-ordination and operational security, {{and a lack of}} artillery. Meanwhile, the Allied response was hampered by poor working relationships at some of the highest levels between Australian and US commanders– particularly between I Corps commander Lieutenant General Edmund Herring and the VII Amphibious Force commander Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey– the lack of a unified command structure, over cautiousness amongst naval staff, and a poor appreciation of overall Japanese strength and intentions by the highest level of the Allied command who failed to send reinforcements until it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> late. Casualties during the attack amounted to at least 679 Japanese killed with another 821 estimated as wounded, while the Australians lost 49 killed and 179 wounded.|$|E

Neither his sequels to Dune {{nor any of}} his other books won a Hugo or Nebula Award, although {{almost all of them}} were New York Times Best Sellers.

500|$|Rogan was the {{greatest}} pitcher that ever threw a ball. He had not only an arm to pitch with but a head to think with. Rogan was a smart pitcher with a wonderful memory. Once Rogan pitched to a batter, he never forgot that batter's weaknesses and strong points. And don't think Rogan was nicknamed [...] "Bullet" [...] for nothing. That guy had a ball that <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> fast to catch. [...] He would really burn 'em in there.|$|E

[...] Futterman said that Menzel [...] "can kill a Gaga ballad", and while she [...] "outshines" [...] Morrison, he [...] "complements her nicely". West gave the mash-up a [...] "B+", called it [...] "really well-done" [...] {{and said it was}} [...] "elevated" [...] by Menzel's voice. MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan wanted Menzel to interpret more songs by Lady Gaga. In contrast, Rae Votta of Billboard denounced the sequence, and called it [...] "horrendous".|$|E

500|$|Solange Knowles {{included}} {{the song in}} the set list for her 2013 world tour, which has received praise from music critics. Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle wrote that Knowles had [...] "put a lovely, downtempo twist on 'I Could Fall in Love". Michael O'Connell of the Hollywood Reporter called Knowles' rendition a [...] "fangirl cover". Writing in the San Francisco Weekly, Erin Browner considered Knowles' cover the [...] "highlight of the night" [...] when she performed it {{at the start of}} her US tour. Browner commented that the [...] "combination of sexy Solange and Selena's epic love song <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> much for the audience to handle" [...] and that [...] "people immediately whipped out their phones to record (yep, it's already on YouTube) and/or just plain cried the lyrics along with her". On 29 March 2015, Filipino singers Angeline Quinto, Yeng Constantino, and Juris Fernandez performed [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] for the variety show ASAP. American singer Adrienne Bailon performed [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] after a six-year departure from the music business, during the March 31, 2015 episode of The Real; a talk show she currently hosts.|$|E
2500|$|In the end, he <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> sure of himself. He {{was quoted}} as saying, [...] "They will write books and make movies about my time here." [...] His 1995 team started out well, {{reaching}} the top 10 after a 3–0 start. However, an embarrassing loss to Colorado on national television started a downward spiral. The Sooners ultimately finished 5–5–1, including only their second losing conference record since World War II. Schnellenberger resigned {{a month after the}} season ended. To this day, Schnellenberger is not held in high esteem by Sooner fans, in part because he made no secret of his lack of interest in the program's history. For instance, he vowed to make [...] "Sooner Nation" [...] forget about Wilkinson and Switzer—a boast considered to be almost heretical by the fan base. He ordered numerous old files to be thrown out; instead, they were archived without his knowledge.|$|E

2500|$|Hughes {{was widely}} {{considered}} {{by those who}} knew him as a likeable and friendly person; a person who wanted to be liked. He said of himself when appointed captain of Australia, [...] "The one thing in my favour is that I will never change. I hope I will always be a likeable enough, easy-to-get-along-with type of person." [...] His biographer noted, [...] "riends, team-mates, coaches, teachers, officials, close observers. Almost all mentioned Kim's niceness. He addresses people by their first name. He loves being around and encouraging children. He likes being people's best friend." [...] As captain Hughes was popular and obliging with the press and the public. English journalist Frank Keating said [...] "Pulled this way and that by photographers, fringers, high commissioners, low commissioners, book commissioners, and hall-porter commissioners, [...] never stopped being softly obliging." [...] The journalist Adrian McGregor said of Hughes, [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> amenable, too nice a guy. He was great with the media, would answer all sorts of questions, never told people to piss off. [...] It was almost like he didn't have the appropriate personality [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|After prodding {{by their}} {{daughter}} Ida, who [...] "perceived {{the need to}} act fast", and with help from Alfred Barr of the New York Museum of Modern Art, Chagall was saved by having his name {{added to the list}} of prominent artists whose lives were at risk and who the United States should try to extricate. Varian Fry, the American journalist, and Hiram Bingham IV, the American Vice-Consul in Marseilles, ran a rescue operation to smuggle artists and intellectuals out of Europe to the US by providing them with forged visas to the US. Chagall was one of over 2,000 who were rescued by this operation. He left France in May 1941, [...] "when it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> late", adds Lewis. Picasso and Matisse were also invited to come to America but they decided to remain in France. Chagall and Bella arrived in New York on 23 June 1941, the day after Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Ida and her husband Michel followed on the notorious refugee ship SS Navemar with a large case of Chagall's work. A chance post-war meeting in a French café between Ida and intelligence analyst Konrad Kellen led to Kellen carrying more paintings on his return to the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Hazlitt was {{ambivalent}} about Rome, the farthest {{point of his}} journey. His first impression was one of disappointment. He had expected primarily the monuments of antiquity. But, he asked, [...] "what has a green-grocer's stall, a stupid English china warehouse, a putrid trattoria, a barber's sign, an old clothes or old picture shop or a Gothic palace ... to do with ancient Rome?" [...] Further, [...] "the picture galleries at Rome disappointed me quite". Eventually he found plenty to admire, but the accumulation of monuments of art in one place <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> much for him, and there were also too many distractions. There were the [...] "pride, pomp, and pageantry" [...] of the Catholic religion, as well as having {{to cope with the}} [...] "inconvenience of a stranger's residence at Rome....You want some shelter from the insolence and indifference of the inhabitants....You have to squabble with every one about you to prevent being cheated, to drive a hard bargain in order to live, to keep your hands and your tongue within strict bounds, for fear of being stilettoed, or thrown into the Tower of St. Angelo, or remanded home.

2500|$|... "God Only Knows" [...] is {{frequently}} cited for referencing [...] "God" [...] in its title, {{a decision that}} Wilson and Asher agonized over, fearing it would not get airplay as a result. As Wilson's then-wife Marilyn describes, [...] "The first time I heard it, Brian played it {{for me at the}} piano. And I went, 'Oh my God, he's talking about God in a record.' It was pretty daring to me. And it was another time I thought to myself, 'Oh, boy, he's really taking a chance.' I thought it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>too</b> religious. Too square. At that time. Yes, it was so great that he would say it and not be intimidated by what anybody else would think of the words or what he meant." [...] Asher explains that he and Brian [...] "had lengthy conversations during the writing of 'God Only Knows', because unless you were Kate Smith and you were singing 'God Bless America', no one thought you could say 'God' in a song. No one had done it, and Brian didn't want to be the first person to try it. He said, 'We'll just never get any air play.' Isn't it amazing that we thought that? But it worked." [...] Wilson added that although he feared putting the word [...] "God" [...] in the title of the song, he eventually agreed to keep it, firstly, [...] "because God was a spiritual word", and secondly, because the Beach Boys would [...] "be breaking ground".|$|E
