40|$|Background: <b>Word</b> {{retrieval}} in <b>aphasia</b> involves {{different levels}} of processing; lemma retrieval, grammatical encoding, lexeme retrieval and phonological encoding, before articulation can be programmed and executed. Several grammatical, semantic, lexical and phonological characteristics, such as word class, age of acquisition, imageability and word frequency influence the degree of success in word retrieval. It is, however, not yet clear how these factors interact. The current study focuses on retrieval of nouns and verbs in isolation and in sentence context and evaluates {{the impact of the}} mentioned factors on the performance of a group of 54 aphasic individuals. Aims: The main aim is to measure the effect of word frequency on the retrieval of nouns and verb by disentangling the influence of word class, age of acquisition, imageability and lemma and lexeme frequency on <b>word</b> retrieval in <b>aphasia.</b> Outcomes and Results: Word class, age of acquisition and imageability {{play a significant role in}} the retrieval of nouns and verbs: nouns are easier than verbs; the earlier a word has been learned and the more concrete it is, the easier it is to retrieve. When performance is controlled for these factors, lemma frequency turns out to play a minor role: only in object naming it affects word retrieval: the higher the lemma frequency of a noun, the easier it is to access. Such an effect does not exist for verbs, neither on an action-naming test, nor when verbs have to be retrieved in sentence context. Lexeme frequency was not found to be a better predictor than lemma frequency in predicting <b>word</b> retrieval in <b>aphasia.</b> Conclusions: <b>Word</b> retrieval in <b>aphasia</b> is influenced by grammatical, semantic and lexical factors. Word frequency only plays a minor role: it affects the retrieval of nouns, but not of verbs...|$|R

40|$|Background: Word {{retrieval}} deficits are a common, pervasive {{feature of}} aphasia. Semantic feature analysis (SFA) {{is a popular}} treatment technique for word retrieval impairment. Preliminary evidence of its use in small aphasia-group settings suggests improved word retrieval in discourse-based tasks with improvements in communicative informativeness (Antonucci, 2009; Falconer & Antonucci, 2012). Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the training of SFA within discourse during a small (two-member) aphasia group treatment to ascertain if gains would be made in word retrieval abilities and communicative informativeness. Method: Two female participants with chronic aphasia, aged seventy seven and sixty eight, participated weekly in group treatment for five consecutive weeks where stimuli were used to elicit increasingly naturalistic discourse. A multiple-baseline design was used and a case series analysis conducted. Baseline measures, treatment data and data from the six week follow-up (SWFU) session were analysed using the protocols developed by Nicholas and Brookshire (1993) and Mayer and Murray (2003). Results: Both participants demonstrated certain modest gains in overall communicative informativeness but these were not maintained at the SWFU session. Gains in informativeness ranged from 12 % to 13. 4 % for participants, which agree with improvements in other studies (Antonucci, 2009; Boyle & Coelho, 1995; Falconer & Antonucci, 2012). P 2 (presented with anomic aphasia) performed better than P 1 (presented with Broca’s aphasia and a component of apraxia of speech [AOS]) with regards to communicative informativeness (%CIUs) and had greater access to semantic knowledge (i. e. could access lexical forms at an improved rate). Conclusion: The small group setting may offer advantages to facilitate communication skills and increase participation in everyday conversation. Further research is needed to identify benefits for individuals with differing aphasia types and severity, optimal intensity and frequency of group treatment and the role of peer support during group interaction.

25|$|The term Anomic Aphasia usually {{refers to}} {{patients}} whose only prevalent symptom is impaired word retrieval in speech and writing. Typically, the spontaneous speech {{of a person}} with anomic aphasia is fluent and grammatically correct but contains many word retrieval failures. These failures lead to unusual pauses, talking around the intended word, or substituting a different word for the intended <b>word.</b> Anomic <b>aphasia</b> is the mildest form of aphasia, indicating a likely possibility for better recovery. Patients with Broca’s aphasia may also have difficulty with word retrieval, or anomia. In addition, patients with Broca’s aphasia comprehend spoken and written language better than they can speak or write. These patients self-monitor, are aware of their communicative impairments, and frequently try to repeat or attempt repairs. The preceding factors discussed correlate with a good prognosis for patients with Broca’s aphasia. Many patients with an acute onset of Broca’s aphasia eventually progress to milder forms of aphasia, such as conduction or anomic.|$|R
40|$|This volume {{focuses on}} the {{remediation}} of impairments of <b>word</b> production in <b>aphasia.</b> It is restricted to studies focusing on single word production and comprises papers {{by some of the}} researchers most active in this field worldwide. The scope of the papers is broad and includes many relatively under-researched areas and techniques. All the papers have in common a methodological rigour and the use of a single case or case-series approach. A range of treatment tasks are evaluated: 'phonological' tasks such as phonological cueing and word repetition, and judgements regarding the phonological form; 'orthographic' tasks such as orthographic cueing, word reading and writing to dictation; 'semantic' tasks such as semantic cueing; the use of gesture; computer presentation of tasks and even just repeated attempts at naming. In addition, the individuals treated using these techniques varied in the nature of their impairments and/or level of impairment that was targeted. The majority aimed to improve word retrieval generally, but one treatment was aimed specifically at verb retrieval, and another at improving accuracy of word production for an individual with a phonological encoding impairment. Each paper relates the outcome of treatment to theoretical accounts of impairment, and one explicitly uses the results of therapy to inform these theories.

40|$|Introduction Literature on word access during oral {{production}} {{has suggested that}} content and function words are generally accessed differently, as reflected by a shorter word durations in oral production of functors (Bolinger & Sears, 1981). This difference in word durations among typical speakers reflects the rate of lexical access, which is mediated by a general mechanism coordinating the pace of higher-level lexical activations and {{the execution of the}} articulatory planning (Bell, Brenier, Gregory, Girand, & Jurafsky, 2009). Depending on the aphasia syndrome, speakers with aphasia should demonstrate varied degree of impairment in lexical (content and/or function) access. The current study aimed to examine whether speakers with aphasia would demonstrate a similar discrepancy of word durations for content and function words. Methods Language samples and their corresponding audio files were collected from 17 Cantonese-speaking individuals with fluent aphasia (fifteen anomic, one transcortical sensory, and one Wernicke’s). Seventeen gender-, age-, and education-matched controls also participated. Using the Cantonese AphasiaBank protocol, each subject provided narrative samples elicited by tasks of personal monologue, picture and sequential description, and story-telling. Following the procedures proposed in Lee, Kong, Chan, and Wang (2013), automatic time alignment was performed on each audio recording according to the manual orthographic transcription. All non-speech and unintelligible speech segments were excluded for alignment. The results of time alignment included the beginning and end time of all sub-syllable units in the utterance, from which the duration of words could be computed. Descriptive analysis was performed on the duration of content and function <b>words</b> in <b>aphasia</b> and normal speech. Results and Discussion Words that had occurred ten times or more in the speech materials was arbitrarily categorized as ‘unique words’ that could more reliably reflect syllable duration. There were a total of 206 unique words (141 content and 65 function <b>words)</b> in the <b>aphasia</b> speech materials and 253 unique words (187 content and 66 function) in the normal materials, most of them were disyllabic or monosyllabic. A higher lexical diversity in the normal group, but similar number of different function words for both groups, was consistent with earlier findings of impaired lexical access in aphasia. Table 1 displays the average duration per syllable and per word for content and function words among the two speaker groups. Our study showed that word duration in aphasic speech was longer than that in control speech. This is in line with our earlier results of higher speaking rate in normal speech. While content words were longer than function words in the aphasic speech, the difference was not as significant as that in controls...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} impact of {{connectionism}} upon our understanding of brain-damaged language performance, and attempts to explain why it is of importance for the neuropsychology of language. Connectionism is an approach to modelling cognitive processes using networks of interconnected, simple, neuron-like units. Behaviour emerges {{as the result of}} the interaction of these units. It has provided a new way of thinking about cognitive processing, emphasizing its low-level mechanisms. One supposed advantage of connectionism is its biological plausibility. It is possible to 'lesion' these systems by destroying some of the units or the connections between them. It is claimed that lesions to connectionist models of particular cognitive systems result in the appropriate acquired disorders.

40|$|Models {{of normal}} word {{production}} are well specified {{about the effects}} of frequency of linguistic stimuli on lexical access, but are less clear regarding the same effects on later stages of word production, particularly <b>word</b> articulation. In <b>aphasia,</b> this lack of specificity of down-stream frequency effects is even more noticeable because there is relatively limited amount of data on the time course of frequency effects for this population. This study begins to fill this gap by comparing the effects of variation of word frequency (lexical, whole word) and bigram frequency (sub-lexical, within word) on word production abilities in ten normal speakers and eight mild–moderate individuals with aphasia. In an immediate repetition paradigm, participants repeated single monosyllabic words in which word frequency (high or low) was crossed with bigram frequency (high or low). Indices for mapping the time course for these effects included reaction time (RT) for linguistic processing and motor preparation, and word duration (WD) for speech motor performance (word articulation time). The results indicated that individuals with aphasia had significantly longer RT and WD compared to normal speakers. RT showed a significant main effect only for word frequency (i. e., high-frequency words had shorter RT). WD showed significant main effects of word and bigram frequency; however, contrary to our expectations, high-frequency items had longer WD. Further investigation of WD revealed that independent of the influence of word and bigram frequency, vowel type (tense or lax) had the expected effect on WD. Moreover, individuals with aphasia differed from control speakers in their ability to implement tense vowel duration, even though they could produce an appropriate distinction between tense and lax vowels. The results highlight the importance of using temporal measures to identify subtle deficits in linguistic and speech motor processing in aphasia, the crucial role of phonetic characteristics of stimuli set in studying speech production and the need for the language production models to account more explicitly for word articulation...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{nature of}} {{selective}} attention {{in people with}} aphasia (PWA) is currently unknown. Selective attention, or our ability to focus on relevant information and ignore distractions, is essential for everyday communication. Inhibition, or suppression of unwanted information, {{is an important part}} of selective attention. This study explored components of inhibition in spoken <b>word</b> production in <b>aphasia,</b> a language disorder impacting more than a million people across the U. S. Specifically, this study examined both interference effects and subsequent reactive inhibition, or the carryover suppression of a previous distraction. Nineteen PWA and 20 age- and education-matched controls participated in a spoken word production task involving Stroop and negative priming experimental paradigms. Stroop color-word stimuli were used to evoke interference and facilitation effects as baseline conditions. Stroop stimuli were also used in negative priming prime-probe pairs, where the prime distractor becomes the probe target, a method of testing reactive inhibition. Response latency and accuracy data were recorded for participants. Research questions were addressed by group-by-condition interactions, analyzed via repeated measures ANOVA and nonparametric/Mann-Whitney tests. Results showed that while both groups demonstrated interference effects, the effects were significantly greater for PWA, as reported in previous research. Interestingly, PWA demonstrated no significant facilitation effects; Controls demonstrated significant reverse facilitation effects. This result was interpreted as PWA's inability to take advantage of contextual cues of proportion. Neither group showed statistically significant evidence of inhibitory rebound, though both groups showed surprisingly similar individual variability, suggesting inhibitory rebound for some and repeated interference facilitation for others. Lastly, PWA demonstrated a near-significant response slowing when a congruent probe had just served as prime distractor, potentially indicating diminished conflict adaptation. These results underscore the challenges interference presents for PWA during spoken word production and indicates potentially diminished executive inhibition. However, PWA's automatic/reactive inhibition appears equivalent to controls, and therefore not a contributing factor in word retrieval impairments of aphasia. However, PWA may have difficulty adapting to contextual information compared to their neurologically healthy counterparts. These results provide direction for future research of selective attention in aphasia [...] aimed to improve clinical protocols for people with this language impairment...|$|R
40|$|Background: While {{previous}} {{research has shown that}} a number of tasks can be successful in improving <b>word</b> retrieval following <b>aphasia,</b> the majority of studies result in improvement restricted to treated items. This has two major implications: first it is essential that personally relevant items of communicative value are treated. Second, treatment is likely to be required long term. Therapy provided as a self-administered home programme has the potential to improve the long-term accessibility of therapy and to be more cost effective. This research {{was part of a larger}} investigation into treatment for lexical retrieval difficulties in adults with aphasia. Our earlier research found that treatment using repetition in the presence of a picture conducted by a clinician was effective in improving the later retrieval of treated words. In this study we modified the treatment programme such that it could be carried out independently by the participants as a home programme using personally chosen words. Aims: The aims of our study were first, to determine if a home treatment programme for word retrieval with personally chosen words could result in significant improvements in lexical retrieval, and second, to observe if there would be carry over to improved word retrieval in conversation. Methods & Procedures: Three people with aphasia participated, and selected 60 personally relevant words for treatment. These stimuli were treated in two sets, each for eight sessions over 2 weeks. Outcomes of treatment were evaluated by comparing naming of these items on three pre-treatment baselines, with naming following the completion of the programme. Semi-structured conversations based around topics relating to the target words were sampled prior to treatment and following treatment to observe generalisation to conversation. Outcomes & Results: Two participants showed evidence of increased accuracy for naming of treated items following the home programme with no change in naming of unseen controls. The conversation outcomes were less clear, with only one participant showing any evidence of greater production of treated items in conversation. Conclusions: This study found that the home treatment programme using personally chosen words improved word retrieval for some participants. However, the outcomes were less robust than those of a clinician-directed therapy study previously conducted by the researchers. There were limitations in the sensitivity of the measures of transfer to conversation and further investigation is required into the extent to which benefits in single word retrieval carry over into word retrieval in conversation. 24 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{cognitive}} processes underlying word production involve selecting a target lexical representation from numerous similar representations. Thus successful lexical selection during word retrieval should engage cognitive control to inhibit lexical competitors {{and the target}} word after selection. Word retrieval difficulty is a hallmark feature of aphasia. It is conceivable that inhibitory control has {{a greater impact on}} word retrieval in persons with aphasia (PWA) due to weakening of lexical representations and exaggerated/diminished inhibitory mechanisms following brain damage (McCarthy & Kartsounis, 2000; Wilshire & McCarthy, 2002). While there is evidence of an association between cognitive control and word production in neurologically healthy adults (e. g., Shao et al., 2013; Talek et al., 2010), this link has not been well investigated in PWA (but see Biegler et al., 2008). Additionally, bilingualism is widely considered to enhance inhibitory control in neurotypical adults (Bialystok et al., 2008; but see Hilchey & Klein, 2011 for a critical review; Green, 1998). Prior investigation of inhibitory advantages in four bilingual PWA has been inconclusive (Green et al., 2010; Penn et al. 2000) and does not address the link between inhibitory control and <b>word</b> retrieval in <b>aphasia.</b> This study examined two questions pertaining to inhibitory control in PWA: 1) if bilingual and monolingual PWA differ in inhibitory control, and 2) if inhibitory control is associated with word retrieval success in PWA. Linguistic and non-linguistic inhibitory control was examined. Methods Thirty-eight PWA participated in this study (20 fluent bilinguals who spoke English, 18 English speaking monolinguals, mean age= 64. 2 years, 11 female, all with left hemisphere stroke, mean years post-onset= 6. 05, matched in demographics and aphasia severity, all p>. 05). Linguistic inhibitory control was measured with the Stroop color-word task (Stroop, 1935), which required responding to the font color of three color words (red, green, yellow) and a neutral word (plan). Non-linguistic inhibitory control was measured with either a spatial Stroop involving response to location of colored squares (Golden, 1978), or Flanker task involving response to direction of an arrow flanked by other arrows (Eriksen & Eriksen, 1974). All experimental tasks had three conditions: a neutral, congruent, and incongruent. By definition, incongruent trials entail inhibition of a potent response (hence slower response latencies) while congruent trials facilitate response latencies. The “Stroop effect” was calculated as difference in reaction times between incongruent or congruent and neutral conditions, and was correlated with two word retrieval measures of the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised (WAB-R, Kertesz, 2006) : confrontation naming and category fluency. Results and Discussion Responses to incongruent trials were slower than congruent for linguistic (F(1, 126. 3) = 44. 9, p. 05). While confrontation naming and category fluency were highly correlated (r=. 77, p<. 001), correlations between linguistic and non-linguistic inhibition and between word retrieval and linguistic/non-linguistic inhibition were non-significant. This large group study poses challenges to theories of bilingual advantage and the role of non-lexical inhibitory measures in word retrieval in PWA...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Neurolinguistic {{models have}} {{coalesced}} around {{the view that}} two distinct pathways support different kinds of processing (Hickok & Poeppel, 2004; Saur et al., 2008) : A ventral stream (VS) maps sound to meaning, while a dorsal stream (DS) maps sound to articulation. Dell, Schwartz, Nozari, Faseyitan, & Coslett (2013) found correspondences between this framework and the interactive two-step model of lexical access (Foygel & Dell, 2000). However, {{there is evidence that}} the arcuate fascicle (AF), a major component of the DS, also contributes to semantic processing (Glasser & Rilling, 2008; Fernandez-Miranda et al., 2014). We present preliminary results from a study applying advanced fiber mapping techniques to investigate white matter correlates of <b>word</b> production in <b>aphasia.</b> METHOD Fifteen participants with aphasia due to left hemisphere stroke were given the Philadelphia Naming Test (mean %correct = 70 %, sd = 23 %) and response-type counts were entered into WebFit ([URL] to estimate the semantic (s) and phonological (p) connection weight parameters of the two-step model. Diffusion spectrum imaging data (acquired via Siemens 3 T Tim Trio Scanner, 32 -channel coil, 257 directions with twice-refocused spin-echo EPI sequence, TR = 9616 ms, TE = 152 ms, voxel size = 2. 4 mm 3, bmax = 7000 s/mm 2, FOV = 231 x 231 mm) were reconstructed by generalized q-sampling, a high angular resolution-based approach. Orientation distribution functions (directional probability of diffusion) were used to calculate quantitative anisotropy (QA) values for each tract using whole-brain seeding and defined ROIs. ROIs for the AF were the superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri. We estimated two regression models with s and p parameters as dependent variables and QA values for the left VS (VSQA; inferior fronto-occipital fascicle, extreme capsule, uncinate fascicle) and DS (DSQA; AF, superior longitudinal fascicle) as predictors. RESULTS VSQA and DSQA were both significant positive predictors of s-weight (p < 0. 05, multiple r-squared = 0. 60, 95 %CI: 0. 07, 0. 88; VSQA semi-partial r-square = 0. 31, 95 %CI: 0. 1, 0. 6; DSQA semi-partial r-squared = 0. 19, 95 %CI: 0. 001, 0. 55) DSQA was a significant negative predictor of p-weight (p = 0. 009, r-squared = 0. 41, 95 %CI = 0. 08, 0. 7), with higher values predicting lower p-weights. DISCUSSION We found significant relationships between VS and DS white matter lesions and semantic word production impairments in aphasia. This is consistent with neurolinguistic models that propose a role for the AF in semantic processing (Glasser & Rilling, 2008; Fernandez-Miranda et al., 2014). They are also consistent with Dell and colleagues (2013), who found that s-weight was associated with lesions in both VS and DS cortical areas. However, when they controlled for lesion volume, relationships with DS areas were absent. Our results must be confirmed in a larger sample with control of lesion volume. We also found a counterintuitive negative relationship between phonological processing and left DS integrity. This suggests that reliance on this pathway may be maladaptive for phonological processing in aphasia. Perhaps patients with more intact dorsal pathways continue to rely on this (still damaged) network, while patients with greater damage are more successful at reorganizing function (cf. Parkinson, Raymer, Chang, FitzGerald, & Crosson, 2009) ...|$|R
40|$|Cherry (1955) {{discovered}} {{that if a}} subject listens to a passage of prose presented to one ear and repeats it aloud, he remains ignorant of the content, though not of the general characteristics, of another, different prose passage presented simultaneously to his other ear. The present thesis examines {{the nature of this}} selective blocking of content in selective dichotic listening, suggests a model for the mechanisms involved, discusses the relations between this and other "kinds" of attention, and speculates on the neurophysiological mechanisms involved. Using Cherry's original technique it is shown that even if the rejected passage is a list of seven words repeated 55 times it leaves no detectable trace (Chapter XI). Certain stimuli can break down this block, however, and these seem to be "important" stimuli such as the subject's own name. An attempt to make a word "important" by pairing it with electric shock la described, with another attempt to change the affective value of stimuli by giving the subject instructions to alter his "set*. The first of these attempts was successful (chapter IV). The block appears to be extraordinarily effective, since the subject's attention does not switch even when there is a considerable disparity in loudness between the two messages (Chapter III). A review is given of some of the recent work on selective listening, and {{on the basis of this}} a model is suggested for the mechanisms which underlie the observed phenomena. The model supposes that the input from either ear is treated in two ways. One pathway from the ear to perceptual mechanisms treats words simply as sounds, and this pathway is not blocked in selective dichptic listening. But there is a second pathway, which leads to the higher analytical mechanisms which treat sounds as words, and in selective listening this may be blocked below the level of conscious perception. The signals passing into the central nervous system are sampled by a localisation device, which compares the two inputs and takes a decision as to whether one or more messages are present and where they are localised. The subject's voluntary decision to listen to one ear and not the other "biasses" the system towards accepting signals along one input pathway rather than the other, unless the localisation device decides there is only one message present in a position which renders the voluntary selection impossible. The brain receives the early parts of the message, and on the basis of past experience of the transitional probabilities between the signals of a language, it predicts what signals are likely to appear later in the message. Whichever input channel receives a message which most nearly matches these predictions will tend to be accepted (Chapter III). Modifications of this basic model are suggested to deal with the role of "important" signals, and situations involving more than two messages (Cbapter IV). Various experiments to test the model are described, such as one in which the transitional probabilities between signals are varied by using statistical approximations to English. Further, if the same message is sent to the two ears, but with a large time difference between the arrival of a given word at the ears, the subject does not realise that they are the same message if he listens to one of them. If he listens to, and repeats, the one which leads in time he realises that they are the same (his attention breaks down) when the two messages are as much as six or more seconds apart. If he listens to the one which lags in time this only happens wben the messages are less than 1 Â½ seconds apart. The difference is shown not to be an artefact of the time taken to repeat what is heard, which takes only about 1 second. The difference would be predicted by the model, and is related to it in discussion. Other data from the review are also related to the model. Two phenomena which bear on the general problem of selective listening are discussed - the time taken to switch attention, and the apparent diversity of the "kinds" of attention. The failure to break down the subject's attention by "setting" him with instructions raised the question of switching time, for one of the conditions used in that experiment was such that the estimate of switching time of attention made by Broadbent (1954), and similar work by the writer, should have allowed the subject ample time to switch to that message for which he was set. An experiment is described which produces results which differ from Broadbent's as regards switching time, and which cast doubt on his "Filter Theory" model. He has suggested that there is a very short term memory store peripheral to a filter which can select one of the possible channels through which signals enter the nervous system, but the data here presented show that the effect of the rate of presentation upon recall of stimuli in an immediate memory experiment is not such as would support Broad- bent's model. A critique of the rationale of experiments on switching time is given, pointing out that the present experimental designs are inadequate to ensure that the subject is indeed switching (Chapter V). The way in which the concept of attention has been used in modern experimental psychology is reviewed, and four apparently distinct uses are described. Firstly there is the "mentalistic" use of the early experimental psychologists, such as Wundt and Titchener. Secondly, there is the use in vigilance experiments, which seem best described as a prolonged task of signal/noise discrimination. Thirdly, there is the use such as is found in the present thesis, where attention refers to the selection of one from a number of possible channels along which signals may arrive. Lastly, there is the use in the sense of "mental concent- ration". Titchener's list of attention-catching stimuli is compared with the results found in selective dichotic listening. It is suggested that it would be both useful and possible to enquire whether separate mechanisms underlie those different uses of the concept of attention, and a start is made in this direction by showing that there is no significant correlation between scores on a test of concentration and scores on a listening-and-repeating situation (Chapter VI). In considering the neurophysiology of these phenomena the evidence about four parts of the mechanism is assessed. Firstly evidence is brought from ablation studies in animals and dysphasia in humans to show that the meaning-analysis mechanisms of the brain can be affected without affecting those responsible for comparatively crude discriminations. For example in <b>word</b> deafness <b>aphasia</b> there is little or no lose in auditory sensitivity as measured with an audiometer, but the meaning of words and tunes is utterly lost. Secondly, the position of the auditory localisation mechanisms is considered, and that for comparing the early and later parts of messages received. It is tentatively concluded that the auditory localisation mechanisms are located in the olivary nuclei of the trapezoid body; and that a pathway from the parieto-temporal area of the cortex which is brought into relation with the afferent inflow by way of a circuit involving the reticular formation may be the mechanism of the prediction devices. Thirdly, the level of the block for meaning is discussed. On the basis of ablation studies in animals, GSR conditioning experiments in the awake human, and EEG studies of the ability of the sleeping human to discriminate between signals, it is suggested that the block lies between the auditory cortex and the reticular formation. Lastly, the question of the way in which "switching" of the attention is brought about is discussed. It is tentatively suggested that the initial "biassing" of the system is through a fronto-reticular pathway, and that the reticular formation is probably the centre of the system, where the several factors responsible for producing the particular response observed on any given occasion interact to produce the final result (Chapter VII). In a final chapter a recapitulation of the model is given together with a brief discussion of the writer's attitude to models in general. The present thesis is considered as a preliminary progress report on work in a field which seems to be as yet untouched except by the writer and Taylor (1960). Points of particular interest are noted and a programme of research using both behavioural and neurophysiological techniques is indicated. </p...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{variants}} of fronto-temporal dementia: a behavioral variant (behavioral FTD, bvFTD, Neary et al. (1998)), which causes changes in behavior and personality but leaves syntax, phonology and semantics relatively intact, and a variant that causes impairments {{in the language}} processing system (Primary Progessive Aphasia, PPA (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2004). PPA can be subdivided into subtypes fluent (fluent but empty speech, comprehension of word meaning is affected / `semantic dementia') and non-fluent (agrammatism, hesitant or labored speech, word finding problems). Some identify logopenic aphasia as a FTD-variant: fluent aphasia with anomia but intact object recognition and underlying <b>word</b> meaning. Mild <b>aphasia</b> can be detected through transcriptions of spontaneous speech (Wolthuis et al., 2014). Spontaneous speech is laborious to transcribe; the use of software can reduce the associated costs, but off-the-shelf speech processing systems are not good enough yet to transcribe speech {{at the level of}} detail required in this domain. It is still an open research question which softwaredetectable features that are relevant for diagnosis can be easily obtained {{with a high degree of}} certainty. One example is the acoustic measure: distribution of silence (pause) in spontaneous speech. The difference in silence frequency and duration between a control and a severe patient is visible to the naked eye in visual representations of the sound. We study the usefulness of acoustic and basic textual transcriptions to distinguish the speech of German-speaking controls and patients with dementia caused by (a) Alzheimer's disease, or by (b) frontotemporal lobar generation, either in the form of PPA or of bvFTD. Our goal is to detect and quantify differences, ultimately scaling to more measurements and patients whose measurements are not obvious to casual hearers. Similar studies for English speakers have demonstrated that machine learning based on acoustic and text transcriptions, and richer models, can be used to discriminate between dementia variants and healthy speakers. Previous approaches were successful in discriminating between and controls and respectively: three FTLD-variants (Pakhomov et al., 2010 a); four FTLD-variants (Peintner et al., 2008); MCI-patients Roark et al. (2011); fluent and non-fluent PPA (Fraser et al., 2013, 2014 a,b); patients with dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease and FTLD-dementia Jarrold et al. (2014); Orimaye and Golden (2014). We focus in this study on those variables that can be measured with the least amount of linguistic transcription: acoustic and textual transcription variables. A realistic model should presumably be based on more transcription detail than just acoustic and textual variables. However, the cost of transcription rises more than linearly with the detail level required for richer models. Before the added costs vs. benefits of richer models can be evaluated, it is important to establish baseline results based on basic transcriptions. The key contributions of this study are as follows. We examine a small set of auditory and textual measures derived from spontaneous speech samples and use these to discriminate between healthy and dementia groups. We analyze German data and compare this to existing studies with English data. Although prosody plays a similar role in German and English, studies have shown that pitch variation and range are different for the two, and that language-specific cues may be used to indicate boundaries (O'Brien et al., 2014). This may influence the role of such variables in discriminators. We limit ourselves to variables that are easy to acquire with software only, to set a baseline for subsequent research with variables that are more costly to measure. Methods We compare the speech of a control group (n= 8) to that of Alzheimer’s patients (n= 7) and FTD-patients diagnosed with either PPA (n= 3) or bvFTD (n= 4). Participant recruitment, data elicitation and manual CLAN-annotation are used from a larger study of processing of verbs and nouns in speakers with different types of dementia, currently performed by the second author. Participants All participants are native German speakers living in nursing homes in the North of Germany. Patients were selected based on psychologically tests, with a diagnosis made by clinicians according prior to the inception of this study. Controls were selected based on a review by a clinician to exclude those diagnosed with dementia. Spontaneous speech was elicited from each particpant; windows of 1 - 2 minutes are used for sampling and subsequent transcription and analysis. Participants are monolingual speakers. Controls were matched with patients for age and education. Text transcription The speech obtained from each participant was manually transcribed in CLAN by trained linguistics students as part of another longitudinal study. This yields measures of vocabulary at the level of shallow parsing from which variables can be determined, such as frequency of types/tokens, part-of-speech, and word length. Acoustic transcription Following the findings of Pakhomov et al. (2010 b); Fraser et al. (2013), a statistical model is trained with a selected set of features. Kaldi (Povey et al., 2011), Audacity and Praat (Boersma and Weenink, 2016) were used to detect pauses, mean frequency and variance for F 0 -F 3. Paired with transcriptions, these yielded variables: pause-to-word ratio, duration of speech, long/short pause count, pause duration, phonation rate, mean recurrence period density entropy (RPDE, Little et al. (2006)). Classification Features are selected based on their significance, determined by Welch's t-test. Different classifiers that each make different assumptions of the independence and distribution of variables (Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Random Forests) are trained on the selected features and evaluated for their accuracy using standard leave-one-out cross-validation. The speech obtained from each participant was manually transcribed in CLAN by trained linguistics students as part of another longitudinal study. This yields measures of vocabulary at the level of shallow parsing from which variables can be determined, such as frequency of types/tokens, part-of-speech, and word length. Results The results of two experiments will be reported: 1. Classification accuracy is compared between (a) only acoustic transcriptions, (b) only textual transcription and (c) both; 2. Individual features are ranked based on their discriminative power in each of the classifiers. Initial results from the experiments will be presented, and a comparison between similar experiments for English as described in the literature (Fraser et al. (2013); Pakhomov et al. (2010 b); Roark et al. (2011) inter alia) will be discussed...|$|R
