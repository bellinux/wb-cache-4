5|$|This {{family of}} white horses {{produced}} Old King in 1908, a dark-eyed white stallion that {{was purchased by}} Caleb R. and Hudson B. Thompson. Old King was bred to Morgan mares to produce a breed of horse known today as the American White Horse. A grandson of Old King, Snow King, {{was at the center}} of the first major study of the dominant <b>white</b> <b>coat</b> color in horses, conducted in 1969 by Dr. William L. Pulos of Alfred University and Dr. Frederick B. Hutt of Cornell. They concluded, based on test matings and progeny phenotype ratios, that the <b>white</b> <b>coat</b> was dominantly inherited and embryonic lethal in the homozygous state. Other factors, such as variations in expressivity and the influence of multiple genes, may have influenced the progeny ratios that Pulos and Hutt observed. The <b>white</b> <b>coat</b> of the American White Horse has not yet been mapped.|$|E
5|$|Pulos and Hutt {{knew that}} if the allele that created a <b>white</b> <b>coat</b> was recessive, then white horses {{would have to be}} {{homozygous}} for the condition and therefore breeding white horses together would always result in a white foal. However, this did not occur in their study and they concluded that white was not recessive. Conversely, if a <b>white</b> <b>coat</b> was a simple autosomal dominant, ww horses would be non-white, while both Ww and WW horses would be white, and the latter would always produce white offspring. But Pulos and Hutt did not observe any white horses that always produced white offspring, suggesting that homozygous dominant (WW) white horses did not exist. As a result, Pulos and Hutt concluded that white was semidominant and lethal in the homozygous state: ww horses were non-white, Ww were white, and WW died.|$|E

40|$|Background: It remains {{important}} to have a thorough knowledge of the micro-flora harboring the <b>white</b> <b>coats</b> of doctors to minimize cross-contamination and improve patient safety by reducing the risk of nosocomial infections. This study presents the microbiological analysis of the <b>white</b> <b>coats</b> in clinical departments of a dental college and hospital. Materials and Methods: The swabs for the study were taken from the <b>white</b> <b>coats</b> of undergraduate students posted in various clinical departments, interns, and the post-graduate students. The microbial contamination was studied by observing and recording the colony morphology on the culture plates, Gram′s staining with light microscopic screening of the slides, and the biochemical characterization of the isolates using standard microbiology protocols. Results: Microbiological analysis of swabs taken from the <b>white</b> <b>coats</b> in the dental operatory showed that 100 % coats had bacterial contamination. Out of 30 swabs collected, 46 cultures were obtained. 50 % cultures showed Gram-positive cocci, making it the major microbial group contaminating the <b>white</b> <b>coats</b> in the dental operatory. Conclusion: The presented study highlights the fact that the <b>white</b> <b>coats</b> are a potential source of cross infection. The results of this study mandate a strict audit process and protocols to be set in place for preventing cross-contamination from the <b>white</b> <b>coats</b> in a dental operatory...|$|R

5|$|W4 {{is found}} in Camarillo White Horses, a breed {{characterized}} by a <b>white</b> <b>coat,</b> beginning with a spontaneous white stallion born in 1912 named Sultan. Like W1 and W3, horses {{with this type of}} dominant white may be pure white or near-white, with pigmented areas along the topline that fade with time. This mutation is also an SNP (c.1805C>T), a missense mutation on Exon12.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were {{split on the}} mode of inheritance of white and whether it was deleterious (harmful). Recent research has discovered several possible genetic pathways to a <b>white</b> <b>coat,</b> so disparities in these historical findings may reflect the action of different genes. It {{is also possible that}} the varied origins of Pulos and Hutt's white horses might be responsible for the lack of homozygotes. Therefore, it remains to be proven whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a greater}} number of colours of coat present in the Cardigan breed than the Pembroke, with the breed {{standard}} allowing for a variety of shades of red, sable and brindle. White markings are expected on this breed of Corgi, and one with a black coat is allowed to have tan or brindle points under conformation show rules. Merle markings are present in the breed, although this is normally restricted to blue merle. There are several disqualification criteria in the breed standard for the purpose of conformation showing. This would include drop ears, a <b>white</b> <b>coat,</b> blue eyes or non-solid black noses in dogs without merle colouration.|$|E

The Performance Colours coatings are {{identical to the}} Performance <b>White</b> <b>coating,</b> but consist of an additional coloured top layer - offering a more robust and maintainable finish. The Performance <b>White</b> <b>coating</b> is suitable for temperatures of up to 1400 °C, whilst Performance Colours can be used up to 900 °C. The current colours on offer are as follows: Graphite, Solid Black, Metallic Black, Alaskan Blue, Warm Grey, Antique Silver, Sterling Silver, Chilled Red, Yellow Gold, Copper, Aqua Green, Fern Green, Aged Brown and Ultra Blue.|$|R
5|$|W3 {{is found}} in Arabian horses descended from R Khasper, a near-white {{stallion}} born in 1996. Neither of his parents were white, and the causative mutation (c.706A>T) {{is thought to have}} originated with this horse. It is a nonsense mutation on Exon4. Horses with the W3 allele often retain interspersed flecks or regions of pigmented skin and hair, which may fade with time. Some members of this family possess blue eyes, but these are thought to be inherited separately from the <b>white</b> <b>coat.</b> Based on similar studies in mice, researchers have named W3 as potentially homozygous nonviable.|$|E
5|$|The French Spaniel (Epagneul Français) is a {{breed of}} dog of the Spaniel-like setter. It was {{developed}} in France and Canada as a hunting dog, descended from dogs of the 14th century. Popular with royalty during the Middle Ages, it nearly became extinct {{by the turn of}} the 20th century but was saved by the efforts of Father Fournier, a French priest. One of the largest breeds of Spaniel, it typically has a <b>white</b> <b>coat</b> with brown markings. It is a friendly breed that has few health issues, but can be affected by a syndrome called acral mutilation and analgesia. The breed is recognised by Canadian and international kennel clubs but not by The Kennel Club (UK). The American Kennel Club has included the breed in its Foundation Stock Service, the first step to full recognition.|$|E
5|$|Blakeney Point has a mixed {{colony of}} about 500 harbour and grey seals. The harbour seals have their young between June and August, and the pups, which can swim almost immediately, {{may be seen}} on the mud flats. Grey seals breed in winter, between November and January; their young cannot swim until they have lost their first <b>white</b> <b>coat,</b> so they are {{restricted}} to dry land for their first three or four weeks, and can be viewed on the beach during this period. Grey seals colonised a site in east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001. It is possible that they now outnumber harbour seals off the Norfolk coast. Seal-watching boat trips run from Blakeney and Morston harbours, giving good views without disturbing the seals. The corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour seals were found in the Blakeney area between March 2009 and August 2010, each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been drawn through a ducted propeller.|$|E

5|$|Pigments are {{coloured}} chemicals (such as melanin) {{in animal}} tissues. For example, the Arctic fox has a <b>white</b> <b>coat</b> in winter (containing little pigment), and a brown coat in summer (containing more pigment), {{an example of}} seasonal camouflage (a polyphenism). Many animals, including mammals, birds, and amphibians, are unable to synthesize most of the pigments that colour their fur or feathers, other than the brown or black melanins that give many mammals their earth tones. For example, the bright yellow of an American goldfinch, the startling orange of a juvenile red-spotted newt, the deep red of a cardinal and the pink of a flamingo are all produced by carotenoid pigments synthesized by plants. In {{the case of the}} flamingo, the bird eats pink shrimps, which are themselves unable to synthesize carotenoids. The shrimps derive their body colour from microscopic red algae, which like most plants are able to create their own pigments, including both carotenoids and (green) chlorophyll. Animals that eat green plants do not become green, however, as chlorophyll does not survive digestion.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{accepted}} coat colours, red and blue, though {{chocolate and}} cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled {{with or without}} black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration {{is the result of}} black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly <b>white</b> <b>coat.</b> This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.|$|E

25|$|Armitstead {{was also}} a {{founding}} member of the Free Foresters Cricket Club, along with his brother Henry. It was during a match between a United England XI and the Free Foresters in 1861 that he is credited with the introduction of the <b>white</b> <b>coat</b> for cricket umpires. Armitstead requested that the umpires wear something white in colour, as their existing garments were causing him to lose sight of the ball and the bowlers hand during their delivery.|$|E
25|$|Historically, all umpires {{have worn}} white, but most {{competitions}} have changed this now {{to ensure that}} umpire uniforms do not clash with team uniforms. Historically, the field umpires and boundary umpires have worn white short-sleeved shirts and white shorts, while goal umpires wore a <b>white</b> <b>coat,</b> white broad-brimmed hat and black trousers. Today, goal umpires wear the same short-sleeved shirts as the other umpires and a peaked cap, but retain the black trousers. Goal umpires also have white flags which are waved to signal scores.|$|E
25|$|The merle allele, which {{produces}} a mingled or patchwork combination of {{dark and light}} areas, is the coat pattern most commonly associated with the breed. This merle (M) is dominant, so heterozygous dogs (Mm) show the pigmentation pattern; however, when two merles are bred, the statistical risk is 25% of the offspring {{will end up with}} the two copies of the merle gene (homozygous). These dogs usually have a mostly <b>white</b> <b>coat</b> and blue irises, and are often deaf, blind, or both. In this case, the deafness and blindness are linked to having two copies of the merle gene, which disrupts pigmentation and produces these health defects.|$|E

25|$|It was claimed {{even before}} his death that Moscati was a miracle-worker; some {{said that he could}} {{accurately}} diagnose and prescribe for any patient merely by hearing a list of his symptoms, and that he was responsible for impossible cures. Reports of his good works continued well after his death, with further reports that he interceded in impossible cases. Consequently, he was beatified by Pope Paul VI on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church on 16 November 1975. Moscati was canonized on 25 October 1987, by Pope John Paul II. His canonization miracle involved the case of a young ironworker dying of leukemia.

25|$|According to legend, Sanduo {{is a war}} god who {{defends the}} local people. In ancient times, a hunter {{discovered}} a strange stone on Jade Dragon Mountain, and carried the stone home. On his way home, he had to put the stone down for a rest, because it was extremely heavy. When he decided to continue his trip, {{he could no longer}} lift the stone, and many thought that it was the embodiment of a god. The Nakhi later built a temple to honour this god, whom they later named Sanduo, and depicted as an immortal in a <b>white</b> <b>coat</b> and a white helmet, carrying a white spear and riding a white horse. They believed that Sanduo would protect the local people and their land. Because Sanduo was thought to have been born in the year of the Goat, it is sacrificed at his festival.|$|E
25|$|The winter fur is very {{dense and}} silky, but quite closely lying and short, while the summer fur is rougher, shorter and sparse. In summer, the fur is sandy-brown {{on the back}} and head and a white below. The {{division}} between the dark back and the light belly is usually straight, though this trait is only present in 13.5% of Irish stoats. The stoat moults twice a year. In spring, the moult is slow, starting from the forehead, across the back, toward the belly. In autumn, the moult is quicker, progressing in the reverse direction. The moult, initiated by photoperiod, starts earlier in autumn and later in spring at higher latitudes. In the stoat's northern range, it adopts a completely <b>white</b> <b>coat</b> (save for the black tail-tip) during the winter period. Differences in the winter and summer coats are less apparent in southern forms of the species. In the species' southern range, the coat remains brown, but is denser and sometimes paler than in summer.|$|E
