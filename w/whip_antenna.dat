5|$|The seven British Army Infantry battalions of the Scottish Division, {{plus the}} Scots Guards and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards regiments, use the Saltire {{in a variety}} of forms. Combat and {{transport}} vehicles of these Army units may be adorned with a small, (130x80mm approx.), representation of the Saltire; such decals being displayed on the front and/or rear of the vehicle. (On tanks these may also be displayed on the vehicle turret). In Iraq, during both Operation Granby and the subsequent Operation Telic, the Saltire was seen to be flown from the communications <b>whip</b> <b>antenna</b> of vehicles belonging to these units. Funerals, conducted with full military honours, of casualties of these operations in Iraq, (plus those killed in operations in Afghanistan), have also been seen to include the Saltire; the flag being draped over the coffin of the deceased on such occasions.|$|E
25|$|Essentially {{similar to}} the P-47B, the initial P-47C {{featured}} strengthened all-metal control surfaces, an upgraded GE turbosupercharger regulator, and a short vertical radio mast. After the initial manufacture of a block of 57 P-47Cs, production moved to the P-47C-1, which had an 8in (20cm) fuselage extension forward of the cockpit at the firewall to correct center of gravity problems, ease engine maintenance and allow installation of a new engine mount. There {{were a number of}} other changes, such as revised exhausts for the oil coolers, and fixes to brakes, undercarriage and electrical systems, as well as a redesigned rudder and elevator balance. The 55 P-47C-1s were followed by 128 P-47C-2s which introduced a centerline hardpoint with under-fuselage shackles for either a 500lb (227kg) bomb or a 200U.S. gal (758l, 167Imp gal) fuel tank that conformed to the underside of the fuselage. The main production P-47C sub-variant was the P-47C-5 which introduced a new <b>whip</b> <b>antenna.</b> With the use of pressurized drop tanks, the P-47C was able to extend its range on missions beginning 30 July 1943.|$|E
2500|$|The first 2,200 cars {{produced}} used a windshield-embedded antenna. This type of antenna {{proved to}} be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually [...] "seek", attempting to find a signal. A standard <b>whip</b> <b>antenna</b> {{was added to the}} outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved, this time {{to the rear of the}} car. Automatic antennas were installed under the grills behind the rear driver's-side window. While giving the reception quality of a <b>whip</b> <b>antenna,</b> these completely disappear from view when not in use.|$|E

2500|$|The {{limitations}} of these frequencies to line-of-sight communications {{during the day}} was not a serious issue for air-to-ground use, where the local horizon might be {{hundreds of miles away}} for an aircraft flying at even moderate altitudes. A good example of the advantages of shorter wavelengths can be seen on the Supermarine Spitfire, which started WWII with an HF radio that broadcast from a cable antenna stretched from the cockpit {{to the top of the}} vertical stabilizer. This provided an average air-to-air range of [...] under ideal conditions. These early TR9D sets were replaced by a VHF set using a small <b>whip</b> <b>antenna</b> offering ranges on the order of , and hundreds miles in the air-to-ground mode.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Whip</b> <b>antennas</b> on {{vehicles}} can {{be damaged}} by automatic car wash equipment, {{especially those that}} use spinning brushes to abrasively rub dirt off {{the exterior of the}} vehicle body. Because the brushes must make contact with the vehicle surface, they can bend or completely break off <b>whip</b> <b>antennas.</b> These antennas are generally recommended to be removed or retracted so that the brushes do not make contact, or the vehicle owner should only use a [...] "touchless" [...] spray jet automatic car wash.|$|R
