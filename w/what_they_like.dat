[...] On 6 July 2011, Absolute Radio {{uploaded}} a video to YouTube where Noel Gallagher speaks about the night Oasis ended. Noel states within this video. 'If I had my time again I would have gone back and done the gig. I'd have done that gig and I'd have done the next gig and we'd have all gone away and we could have probably discussed it. We may never have split up.' ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Madonna {{released}} her twelfth studio album, MDNA. The lead single, [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'", and subsequent releases from the album were not {{added to the}} Radio 1 playlist, despite the former featuring rappers Nicki Minaj and M.I.A., two artists who receive regular rotation on the station. Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills defended their decision not to play Madonna saying, [...] "I don't think we play Madonna any more. There {{is a lot of}} research, and if you ask a 17-year-old about her, they go 'don't care' [...] it's a sign of the times, things change, it's a generational thing. I like Madonna, does a 17-year-old? [...] probably not {{at the top of their}} list. And that's horrible, but that is the way it is [...] and also youth audiences are so fickle in <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> and what they don't like, and they're quite opinionated, you just have got to keep on top of that." ...|$|E

The Times quotes D. E. Rhodes, a British authority on fishing literature, who defended Walton, saying, [...] "It seems to me unjust to accuse Izaak Walton of plagiarism, because plagiarism {{did not exist in}} the 17th century. All authors of that and earlier ages read <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> and used <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> of it without acknowledgment." ...|$|R
500|$|Joseph Desha, the {{outgoing}} governor, {{refused to believe}} that his party had lost the election. He disliked Metcalfe not only due to his party affiliation, {{but also because of}} his occupation as a stonemason, which he believed was too low a calling for a governor. Metcalfe's opponents made slights on the quality of his stone work and his views on the Old Court-New Court controversy. When told about these charges, Metcalfe remarked [...] "They may say <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> about my views, but the first man that dares to attack my character, I will cleave his skull with my stone hammer, as I would cleave a rock." [...] As word of this remark spread, Metcalfe was given the nickname [...] "Old Stone Hammer." [...] Despite his threats to remain in the governor's mansion until the legislature convened, Desha respected the will of the people, and left the residence on September 2, 1828.|$|E
500|$|Margaret (Annette Crosbie) {{is having}} a heated {{telephone}} conversation with a solicitor about an incident in which Victor is accused of having thrown a syringe into someone's buttock. She reveals that a conviction might be difficult as her husband has been dead for five months. While {{coming to terms with}} her husband's death as a hit and run victim, Margaret joins a church group clearing litter from roadsides. There she meets Glynis Holloway (Hannah Gordon), whose husband has also recently died. The two become good friends. Confiding to a priest, Father Blakey (William Osborne), Margaret pledges vengeance for Victor's death, vowing [...] "If they ever find the bastard who was at the wheel of that car I swear I'll kill him, with my bare hands if I have to, and they can do <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> with me".

500|$|Game {{director}} and composer Junichi Masuda stated that {{to keep the}} games fresh, he looks at every previous element {{to decide what to}} adapt to the new game, stating [...] "people may not like <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> in the past, trend wise". He explained the new battle styles, stating that while triple battles take more strategy, rotation battles take more luck to win. Masuda stated that their goal when making the games was to make it fun for new players, but they also wanted to get players who have not played the series in a while to come back. He said that it was hard to find that balance to satisfy both kinds of players. For the new players, there is good explanation in how to play, while for old players, they incorporated the C-Gear, which makes the ability to trade and battle easier. When asked about the decision to introduce over 150 new species of Pokémon, Masuda stated that they did this so old players {{would not be able to}} know what is a good Pokémon to use, and it would level the playing ground for new players.|$|E

The video closes {{in the same manner}} it began, with the switchblade impaling the spray painted image. The music video won the Brazilian TVZ Video Award: Best International Music Video of the Year. Interviewed on her experience during the video one of the dancers, Carmit Bachar (of The Pussycat Dolls) noted, [...] "I was called in by Vincent Paterson for 'Blood on the Dance Floor'. It was to have a Latin feel, some sort of mambo. I arrived wearing a little salsa dress, fish nets, heels, and my hair was up in a kind of bun with a flower. I was 'camera ready'. I showed up with the whole outfit. It's not that producers can't see <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>like,</b> or the potential in somebody, but what I do helps them to see their vision more".|$|E
500|$|Davis toured relentlessly for {{two years}} while tolerating intense {{physical}} pain and difficulty walking, caused by joint pain from sickle-cell anaemia, badly damaged ankles after a 1972 car wreck, and osteoporosis in his left hip, which had been operated on a decade earlier. He had also developed nodules on his larynx that often left him short of breath, especially when playing the trumpet. To numb the pain, he became increasingly dependent on self-medicating with painkillers, cocaine, and morphine, which combined with his alcohol and recreational drug use led to mood swings; he would by turns feel vulnerable and hostile. By the end of 1974, a disappointing showing in Down Beat magazine's readers poll reinforced to Davis that his reputation had diminished. Unfazed by detractors and personal troubles, he kept his touring schedule intense. [...] "He was like the general looking at the fort {{and they had a}} moat {{and we were going to}} get in that fort", Henderson later said. [...] "That was the attitude of the band. We didn't give a shit what the critics said. People are gonna like <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>like,</b> but if you don't like it, respect it. Respect that I have the right to do what I do. Because with or without you, we're going to do it anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{believe that}} {{regardless}} of what the residents of Discovery Bay may think, the reason for the monopoly is because HKRI built the development through private funds and are entitled to do <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> to ensure the company maximizes profits for the benefit of its shareholders. They believe, essentially, that no one is forced to live in Discovery Bay and they should move if they don't like it. [...] Others believe that as a part of Hong Kong the same access should be allowed as in other areas and that development by a private company does not give that company the right to exert total control over a neighborhood.|$|E

2500|$|Santos, {{alongside}} de Guzman, {{appeared in}} two more films, {{the first film}} was a romantic comedy My Pledge of Love. She portrayed a spunky traveller {{at the center of}} a battle between three different guys (played by de Guzman, Bobby Andrews and Onemig Bondoc). Next up was a second movie Kasal-kasalan... Sakalan that starred Santos as good-hearted but hapless bride-to-be in the midst of premarital discourse. Both films were critical and commercial failures. Her performances were received poorly, with Ana Pingol of YES! Magazine saying [...] "there is always the danger of lukewarm—or worse, negative reception from the public who once adored you. The public can be pretty conservative; they stick to what is familiar [...] to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>like</b> or has changed into something the public has not taken to—yet".|$|E

She gave the album 2 out of 5 stars. Andy Gill of The Independent gave a notably unfavorable review wherein the album was awarded 1 out of 5 stars. He criticized the group's lack of identity, in particular the loss of founding member Buchanan, writing: [...] "Sugababes finally slipped from being a band to a brand". He {{went on to say that}} the [...] "policy of replenishment has eroded both the trio's character and its appeal". Regarding the quality of the album, Gill felt that Sweet 7 contained mostly [...] "generic disco stompers". Rick Pearson of London Evening Standard wrote that Range, Berrabah and Ewen were unconvincingly [...] "grasping for an identity" [...] on the album, giving it 2 out of 5 stars. Alex Denney of NME awarded it 4 out of 10, writing that Sweet 7 [...] "leaves us hankering after the good old days" [...] and that [...] "time was we could expect more than bland consistency from the Sugababes – shame." [...] Johnny Dee of Virgin Media awarded Sweet 7 2 out of 5 stars; according to him, the Sugababes [...] "have completely lost all vocal character and personality". The Timess Dan Cairns criticized the album's songs and went on to write that the Sugababes in 2010 [...] "are a pale, karaoke imitation of the glory days." [...] Simon Price of The Independent wrote that the group [...] "plays it depressingly safe with substandard electro pop", while reacting negatively to the line-up change, saying: [...] "They [...] can call themselves <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>like,</b> but they'll never fill the heels of Keisha, Mutya and Siobhan.
