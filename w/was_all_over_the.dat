5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters {{thought it was a}} fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. I have never seen a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
25|$|Bon Jovi mounted another huge {{worldwide}} {{tour that}} continued throughout 1989 and 1990. They visited more than 22 countries and performed more than 232 shows before it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over.</b> <b>The</b> personal highpoint {{for the band}} was their June 11, 1989 sell-out homecoming at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. In August 1989, the band headed to the Soviet Union for the Moscow Music Peace Festival. Bon Jovi were the first band officially sanctioned by the Soviet government to perform in the Soviet Union and New Jersey became the first U.S. album to be released legally in the U.S.S.R..|$|E
25|$|Senna took pole, but Prost {{beat him}} away from the grid and led by 1.4seconds {{by the end of the}} first lap. By lap 15, however, Senna <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> back of Prost's McLaren after moving through both Williams and Benettons. He whittled down Prost's 5 second lead to just under a second by lap 30, but the latter pulled a few seconds ahead by the 35th lap. By the end of lap 46, with 7 to go, the gap was just over a second. Senna, further back than he had been earlier in the race, made a move on Prost in the chicane before the start-finish straight. True to his word, Prost closed the gap and the two skidded into the escape road and both engines stalled. Prost jumped from his car. Senna, however, got a push from the marshals and {{returned}} to the track.|$|E

25|$|The Germans {{arrived to}} a deserted island, {{and began to}} follow their orders to fortify Alderney as part of Hitler's Atlantic Wall. In January 1942 they built four camps in Alderney: two work camps, Lager Helgoland and Lager Borkum, and two {{concentration}} camps, Lager Sylt and Lager Norderney. They were built by the Nazi Organisation Todt (OT) to house the labour used to build fortifications including bunkers, gun emplacements, tunnels, air-raid shelters and other concrete and field fortifications. Lager Norderney, containing Russian and Polish POWs, and the Lager Sylt camp holding Jewish slave labourers, were transferred to SS administration in March 1943 {{under the control of}} Hauptsturmführer Maximilian List. There are 397 graves in Alderney, which when added to the men who died in ships, takes the total to over 700 out of a total inmate population of 6,000 who lost their lives before the camps were closed and the remaining inmates transferred to France in 1944. On the return to their island, Alderney evacuees had little or no knowledge of the crimes committed on their island during the occupation, because by December 1945, the first date civilians could return home, all the slave labourers had been sent away and the majority of the German troops left behind were not senior staff. Evidence, however, <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> island, with concrete fortifications and graveyards for the prisoners kept there during the occupation.|$|E

500|$|Many {{scenes were}} shot in advance. The {{producers}} disliked filming beforehand as they preferred [...] "the audience {{to tell us}} what's good and what's bad." [...] They also were concerned that a flashback episode would {{be mistaken for a}} clip show, but felt it would be believable because they were [...] "flashing so far back into the past." [...] According to Kauffman, certain scenes filmed in the apartment were shot in advance because [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> place"; the cast were tired and full and their energy levels were low. Special effects and costume changes meant [...] "three or four scenes" [...] were also pre-shot to ensure the dialogue was happening in front of the audience. This was completed in two days.|$|E

500|$|Dan Martin of The Guardian {{was less}} favourable, stating the {{producers}} [...] "promised us a cliffhanger, and now we're left the whole summer long to contemplate whether our favourite show can really have just dropped the ball. Oh {{there was plenty}} to love about this mid-season finale, and even more to pick over. But as an hour of drama it <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> place". Because the episode was so fast-paced with little being explained, {{he did not feel}} any emotional connection to the Anglican marines or Lorna Bucket. Unlike Fuller, Martin was not favourable to Smith's Doctor, stating [...] "the non-event of the battle means the Doctor never really gets to show this dark side we've been hearing so much about" [...] and that Smith's predecessor, David Tennant, [...] "got angrier most weeks". Martin did have praise for the final reveal of the episode, stating that although it had been [...] "hidden in plain view from the very beginning as soon as it's revealed Amy has called the baby Melody", he was unable to make the connection and was suitably surprised. Martin later rated it the second-to-worst episode of the series, though the finale {{was not included in the}} list.|$|E
500|$|The band took a {{break from}} {{performing}} live between the NetAid charity concert in October 1999 and 2001. They returned to {{the stage for a}} further charity gig on 28 April, in support of Unison's campaign for a living wage at the Manchester Evening News Arena. Matthews said prior to the performance that [...] "It's a cause I think's really important and it just seemed to be the right time for us to come back – it's a long, long time since we played live. It should be really great. We're really looking forward to what they (the new songs) are going to sound like live. It'll be good {{to get back on the}} old live circuit again." [...] They played several tracks from their upcoming album, at that point entitled It's What's Not There That Makes What's There What It Is. By May, it had been renamed to Paper Scissors Stone. Matthews was looking forward to the new releasing, explaining to NME that [...] "I think it's stronger than the last album, a bit more avant garde!...It's a bit less stupid.

500|$|She then {{embarked}} on an affair with fellow resident Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson). Kelly stated during an interview that she felt Becky was [...] "punching above her weight" [...] with Jason. Kelly revealed that she felt Steve was the best man for Becky over her previous lover Jason, stating: [...] "Both boys bring out different things in Becky. With Jason, they liked going clubbing, {{and it was no}} strings attached, I think Becky needs more than that, even though she wouldn't admit it. I think, long-term, Steve's better for her." [...] When Gregson was interviewed by entertainment website Digital Spy, he was asked if he thought that his character has had a positive impact on Becky's life. In reply he stated: [...] "I think he's turned it around. She <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> place getting into trouble all the time but he's made her grow up. And having a little girl there in Amy, that's made her grow a bit, too. She's got responsibilities now. She's besotted with him. She's still a total pisshead, though!" [...] Steve and Becky attempted to marry twice in 2009; their first wedding was given a promotional push from ITV, which aired adverts for the first wedding episodes. Their relationship was featured in a serious of romanctic plots in which ITV dubbed the [...] "Summer of Love" [...] season of the soap, with advertisements airing.|$|E

500|$|In 1959, Lawrence Wien, {{owner of}} New York City's Plaza Hotel {{purchased}} the hotel, but signed a management deal for Clark {{to remain as}} manager. In the early 1960s, the mafia-financed casino hotels of the Las Vegas Strip and Nevada came under close scrutiny by the FBI, and they placed increased pressure on the Nevada Gaming Control Board to force the mobsters out of Las Vegas. After Sam Giancana was spotted on the premises of Frank Sinatra's Cal Neva Lodge & Casino at Lake Tahoe, his gambling license was removed by the Board and {{he was forced to}} sell up and forfeit his share in the Sands Hotel and Casino. The Desert Inn faced similar scrutiny by the FBI, attracting controversy at the same time for the involvement of Dalitz and his mobster associates, but simultaneously called for the prosecution of the FBI for illegal wiretapping. In 1964, Clark sold his remaining share in the hotel to Dalitz and business associates Morris Kleinman, Thomas McGinty and Sam Tucker. He {{died of a heart attack}} the following year. The bell captain of the Desert Inn, Jack Butler, remembered Clark: [...] "Wilbur was the greatest guy. Without him this town never would've got off the ground. Everyone came into the club just to see him and he <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> postcards. He was the only boss who would agree to have his picture taken".|$|E
500|$|Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it was {{favorable}} of {{the early}} pairing of Tucker and Ashley, giving them an [...] "honorable mention" [...] {{on a list of}} [...] "curiously quirky couplings". Candace Young of the website She Knows Soaps wrote that, [...] "Ashley and Tucker have been interesting as a power couple, if you will, in business and the corporate world." [...] In January 2011, Garrett awarded Nichols a [...] "Leading Men Gold Standard" [...] and praised his portrayal that week, writing: [...] "Stephen Nichols as Tucker <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> place this week. Initially Tucker decided to back the recording label of Devon Winters and Noah Newman. Nichols played a man who wanted to help two young men break into the music industry. However, the shocking news that Cane and Sofia have been lying to Tucker and allowing a conman to swindle Tucker’s company was destined to be revealed. Although the climax came {{at the end of the}} week, the intensity in which Stephen Nichols played the revelation was exciting to say the least. Fans know that next week Tucker McCall’s going to cause heads to roll." [...] Jae Jones of Yahoo! praised the storyline revealing Tucker as Devon's father as it gave the soap opera's matriarch, Katherine, a biracial grandson. She wrote: [...] "What seems to make the story line even more interesting is the fact that she has a biracial grandson. Who would have ever thought the show could catch up with the current times? There are not too many daytime soaps left for housewives and house husbands to enjoy, but those who watch this show are always in for a special treat each afternoon."

2500|$|Brann were {{notorious for}} lacking a regular goal scorer {{ever since the}} 1970s, but this ended with Trond Egil Soltvedt's many goals in 1993 and 1994. His {{extremely}} dedicated style, his innocent and somewhat naïve personality {{and the fact that}} many of his goals were scored as a midfielder made him immensely popular. Just before the start of the 1995 season, however, he was sacked by Brann's board for [...] "disloyalty", the board refusing to elaborate on this. Disciplinary action was also taken against stars Frank Strandli, Inge Ludvigsen and Claus Lundekvam. This caused a public outcry, the issue <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> national media, there were demonstrations in the centre of Bergen, and the fans were split in their support to Soltvedt or to the board and manager Hallvar Thoresen. Attendances and the atmosphere on Brann Stadion initially plummeted as a result of this. The team spirit amongst players also seemed broken, and the first game against Molde F.K. was lost 6-0 at home, resulting in the entire crowd yelling for the board to resign. With Brann at bottom position halfway through the league season, Hallvar Thoresen was sacked and Kjell Tennfjord, the manager behind Fyllingen IL's success, was appointed. He saved Brann into an eventual mid-table position and led them to the Norwegian cup finals, again sparking immense optimism around the club.|$|E

He <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> place, winning tackles, making passes and getting up and down the park and it was great to see." [...] On 16 March 2011, Ledley scored both Celtic goals in a 2–1 Scottish Cup win against Inverness Caledonian Thistle, taking Celtic into the last four. On 20 March 2011, Ledley played in the second cup final of his career, this time the Scottish League Cup Final against Rangers. [...] He scored with a glancing header in the first half to equalise an earlier goal from Rangers, but the Ibrox club eventually ran out 2–1 winners after extra time. A hamstring injury sustained in a league game against Rangers on 24 April 2011 ruled Ledley out of action for the rest of that season, with him missing out on Celtic's 3–0 win over Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final.
