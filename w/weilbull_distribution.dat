40|$|The {{shattering}} {{habit of}} rice affects harvest efficiency and also {{is one of}} the important traits. The evaluation way of the habit has been demanded, and the mean value and variance have previously been used for this purpose. In this study, the shattering habit was evaluated by the strength distribution on the grain detachment force because it immediately reflected the habit. Experiments ware carried out for 49 days during the harvest season, and the grain detachment force was measured due to parallel pull (parallel foece) and perpendicular pull (perpendicular force). As a result, the mean value of the parallel force slightly increased through the experiments, and the shape of the strength distribution varied. Next, the <b>Weilbull</b> <b>distribution</b> was applied in order to evaluate the strength distribution. The <b>Weilbull</b> <b>distribution</b> fairly conformedd to the strength distribution on the grain detachment force, which was consisted of 945 samples. Also, the amouont of samples to determine the <b>Weilbull</b> <b>distribution</b> was discussed. The result showed that the <b>Weilbull</b> <b>distribution</b> could be accurately determined using about one hundred samples...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} results of {{analysis}} of the wind potential in selected locations in the southern Poland (placed in the Małopolskie, Świętokrzyskie and Podkarpackie Voivodships). The measurements {{and analysis of the}} wind resources in potential locations of the wind turbines are important part of the investment process. The statistical analysis involves the creation of histograms (e. g. histogram of the wind speed and direction) and fitting those histograms to theoretical <b>distributions</b> (e. g. <b>Weilbull</b> <b>distributions</b> of wind speed). Such analysis has been described and conducted using measurement data for four selected locations. Basis on the conducted analysis, the economy efficiency and environmental impact of wind turbine operation has been estimated. Three market available wind turbines have been included to calculate NPV, IRR and SPBT indicators. Then, the avoided emissions of CO 2, NOx, SO 2 and dust have been calculated. There were also conducted some calculation using TRNSYS simulation software. The results of simulations have been compared with measurement data and the level of convergence have been found...|$|R

40|$|Similar to nacre or brick-and-mortar structures, imbricated {{lamellar}} {{structures are}} widely found in natural and man-made materials and {{are of interest}} for biomimetics. These structures {{are known to be}} rather insensitive to defects and to have a very high fracture toughness. Their deterministic behavior has been intensely studied, but statistical studies have been rare and is so far there is no undisputed theoretical basis for the probability distribution of strength of nacre. This paper presents a numerical and theoretical study of the PDF of strength and of the corresponding statistical size effect. After a reasonable simplifications of the shear bonds, an axially loaded lamellar shell is statistically modelled as a square fishnet pulled diagonally. A finite element (FE) model is developed and used in Monte Carlo simulations of strength. An analytical model for failure probability of the fishnet is developed and matched to the computed statistical histograms of strength for various sizes. It appears that, with increasing size, the pdf of strength slowly transits from Gaussian to <b>Weilbull</b> <b>distribution</b> but the transition is different from that previously obtained at Northwestern for quasibrittle materials of random heterogeneous mesostructure...|$|E
