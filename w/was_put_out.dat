5|$|First Great Western {{exercised}} a {{break clause}} in the Greater Western franchise thus avoiding large premium payments to the Department for Transport. With the franchise to now conclude in March 2013, it <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> to tender, but the process was scrapped {{as part of the}} fallout from the collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition.|$|E
5|$|Quarterback Charlie Boxold led Maryland {{in passing}} with three {{completions}} on nineattempts for 42yards. Dick Nolan led in receiving with tworeceptions for 31yards.

Bob Burris was the Sooners' leading receiver with threereceptions for 17yards.|$|E

Much later transports of warships across the Isthmus in the late 9th century and around 1150 are assumed to have used a route other than the Diolkos due to the extensive time lag.|$|E

5|$|The royal {{suppression}} of the revolt began shortly {{after the death of}} Wat Tyler on 15 June.

5|$|First Great Western {{declined}} a {{contractual option}} {{to continue the}} Greater Western passenger franchise (of which services at Avonmouth are a part) beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line.

5|$|When Orton {{was well}} enough to wrestle, Punk demanded a match with him, which he won via {{disqualification}} when DiBiase interfered. As a result, Orton punted DiBiase in the head, putting him out of action; this storyline {{was put in place}} in order for DiBiase to take time off to film The Marine 2. Orton then invited Rhodes and Manu to form a group with him called The Legacy, and used them to help in his rivalry with Batista leading to a three-on-two handicap match where Batista <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> of action for four months.|$|E

5|$|In May at the 34th French Championships the men's doubles tournament {{took place}} first. With Lacoste – Borotra's victory over Tilden – Hunter and Cochet – Brugnon's easy win over Gregory – Collins {{in the semifinals}} secured the Four Musketeers their third doubles {{face-to-face}} final. Unfortunately for Cochet in the fifth set they were serving for the match and had thirty-love in the game, when Brugnon missed an easy ball when three match points were at stake. Lacoste and Borotra revived {{from that moment on}} and closed out the final set 8–6. In singles he <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> of the contest by Borotra in the semifinals and thus was unable to retain his title. However, Cochet did not leave without a trophy as the mixed championship was earned by him and Eileen Bennett Whittingstall.|$|E
5|$|Injuries had {{devastated the}} Maryland roster the {{previous}} year, and while 2008 was more forgiving by comparison, several key players were injured. Starting cornerback Kevin Barnes suffered a season-ending scapular fracture against Wake Forest {{and missed the}} last six games. Sophomore LaQuan Williams and true freshman Kevin Dorsey, both wide receivers, sat out the entire season due to leg and foot injuries, respectively. Leading receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey sat out the Boston College game due to a calf injury, and leading rusher Da'Rel Scott suffered a left shoulder injury in the third game against California, which plagued him throughout the season, although he missed just one game. Running back Morgan Green, who had contended for the starting position during summer camp, had an injury-riddled season, before seeing his first real action in the bowl game. Starting quarterback Jordan Steffy <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> for the season by a thumb injury on his throwing hand in the first game.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, 1975, a three-alarm fire {{broke out}} on the 11th floor of the North Tower. The fire spread through {{the core of the}} {{building}} to the 9th and 14th floors, as the insulation for telephone cables, located in a utility shaft that ran vertically between floors, had been ignited. Areas most affected by the fire were extinguished almost immediately, and the original fire <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> in a few hours. Most of the damage was on the 11th floor, where the fire was fueled by cabinets filled with paper, alcohol-based fluid for office machines, and other office equipment. Fireproofing protected the steel, and there was no structural damage to the tower. In addition to the fire damage on the 9th and 14th floors, water used to extinguish the fire damaged a few floors below. At the time, the World Trade Center complex had no fire sprinkler systems.|$|E

5|$|The Luftwaffe {{scored a}} notable {{success on the}} night of 2 December 1943 when 105 Ju 88 bombers struck the port of Bari. Skilfully using chaff to confuse the Allied radar operators, they found the port packed with brightly lit Allied shipping. The result was the most {{destructive}} air raid on Allied shipping since the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Hits were scored on two ammunition ships and a tanker. Burning oil and exploding ammunition spread over the harbour. Some 16 ships were sunk and eight damaged, and the port <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> of action for three weeks. Moreover, one of the ships sunk, SS John Harvey, had been carrying mustard gas, which enveloped the port in a cloud of poisonous vapours.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the wing was its washout. The {{trailing}} edge of the wing twisted slightly upward along its span, the angle of incidence decreasing from +2° at its root to -½° at its tip. This caused the wing roots to stall before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise {{have resulted in a}} wing drop, often leading to a spin. As the wing roots started to stall, the separating air stream started to buffet (vibrate) the aircraft, warning the pilot, and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft to the limits of its performance. This washout was first featured in the wing of the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire. The complexity of the wing design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, at first caused some major hold-ups in the production of the Spitfire. The problems increased when the work <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most of these problems had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.|$|E
5|$|On 27 May, {{the first}} full day of the evacuation, one cruiser, eight destroyers, and 26 other craft were active. Admiralty {{officers}} combed nearby boatyards for small craft that could ferry personnel from the beaches out to larger craft in the harbour, as well as larger vessels that could load from the docks. An emergency call <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> for additional help, and by 31 May nearly four hundred small craft were voluntarily and enthusiastically {{taking part in the}} effort. The same day, the Luftwaffe heavily bombed Dunkirk, both the town and the dock installations. As the water supply was knocked out, the resulting fires could not be extinguished. An estimated thousand civilians were killed, one-third of the remaining population of the town. The Luftwaffe was met by 16 squadrons of the Royal Air Force, who claimed 38 kills on 27 May while losing 14 aircraft. Altogether, over 3,500 sorties were flown in support of Operation Dynamo. The RAF continued to take a heavy toll on the German bombers throughout the week. Soldiers being bombed and strafed while awaiting transport were for the most part unaware of the efforts of the RAF to protect them, as most of the dogfights took place far from the beaches. As a result, many British soldiers bitterly accused the airmen of doing nothing to help.|$|E
