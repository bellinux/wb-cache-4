5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, it was as though my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was a bit much.|$|E

25|$|According to Robert McComb, {{the home}} {{inspired}} his famous brother, who loved the house:The {{house was the}} home of the band <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in Perth. The sprawling rooms, lofts and underground cellars we used to rehearse in were things most Perth houses didn't have; there was such a strong atmosphere there that Dave would return to it for inspiration.|$|E

25|$|B {{were very}} strong characters, {{with a very}} {{specific}} type of humor and very loyal fans, {{and of course they}} were instantly identifiable. I felt that referencing them in Daria, <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> trying to establish the new characters and the different type of humor, ran the risk of setting up false expectations and disappointment in the viewers – which could lead to a negative reaction to the new show and its different tone. So we steered clear of B in the early going, and once the new show was established, there was really no need to harken back to the old one.|$|E
25|$|The 29th had dawned calm, but <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{still trying}} to persuade {{ourselves}} that the tragedy was over and the volcano had exhausted its bowels, at about 8 o'clock, we heard a crash and then I noticed that smoke was rising {{from the point of}} the island that looks towards east. The smoke spread very gradually as far as the crater of the volcano, while there were many whiffs issuing from points in the direction of another headland. I realized that the island had opened in these places and fearing that, if a crater should open below the water, an explosion might follow, much more formidable than the preceding ones, I mounted a horse and retired permanently to the Sanctuary of Caysasay.|$|E
500|$|Hard as the Americans {{worked to}} {{incorporate}} {{themselves into the}} Grand Fleet, they had yet to shake a belief among the veteran British that they were amateurs merely playing at war. In writing to his American-born wife following the maneuvers, Admiral Beatty noted that, [...] "The American Squadron enjoyed themselves greatly <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> out, and did well, and will do better next time. I am sending old Rodman out on an operation of his own, which pleases him and gives them an idea that they are really {{taking part in the}} war. I trust they will come to no harm." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{composer}} Granville Bantock was enlisted as musical {{director in}} 1897 at the ballroom to provide music each weekday {{for six hours}} of ballroom dancing. To begin with, as the tower was being erected, {{he was in charge}} of a [...] "semi-military band" [...] that played outdoors with the fear that the tower might fall upon him and his players. Bantock is quoted as saying, [...] "The noise of the riveting of the tower <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> playing... reminded me of the anvil music in Das Rheingold". Bantock often played for the workmen during their lunch breaks, when they could frequently be heard saying, [...] "play it again, guv'nor".|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} album in Europe, Kiedis and Frusciante both agreed {{they would make}} the trip. However, it proved {{difficult}} for Frusciante to adapt to life outside of the mansion, after being in near-seclusion for almost 30 days. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "He had such an outpouring of creativity <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> making that album that I think he really didn't know how to live life in tandem with that creativity." [...] It was also during this period when Frusciante began to experiment with heroin, which further compromised his mental stability. The European promotional trek took its toll on Frusciante, {{and he decided to}} return home when he and Kiedis reached London.|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners later {{noted that}} [...] "Theef" [...] was {{difficult}} to shoot because {{the cast and crew}} had inadequate time to prepare. He explained, [...] "It was kind of a rush thing and we got the script very late. We were totally winging it <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> shooting it". Manners later stated that the episode [...] "came together" [...] in the editing room: [...] "When I looked at the footage, it was like I was looking at somebody else's film. But it cut together real nice and the end result was that 'Theef' {{turned out to be a}} decent little episode". Manners later admitted that the episode was his only credit for the series during which he experienced illness. With Manners out for a day due to his sickness, Rob Bowman took over directing duties for a day.|$|E

500|$|Midway {{through their}} unbeaten run, City faced Tottenham Hotspur {{at home in}} snowy conditions, in a match {{televised}} on Match of the Day. As the teams came out onto the frozen pitch, commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme called the Manchester City team as [...] "the most exciting team in England". Aided by a modification to the studs on their boots suggested by Tony Book, City produced one of their best footballing performances in their history. One Spurs player was quoted as saying, [...] "It was extraordinary. City moved like Olympic speed skaters <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> falling around like clowns on a skid patch." [...] Tottenham took an early lead through Jimmy Greaves, but Bell equalised before half-time, {{and in the second}} half City besieged Tottenham, scoring three more times to win 4–1. After the match City trailed the league leaders by only a single point.|$|E
500|$|Ybarra said in 1987 {{that the}} game had created a [...] "beachhead {{in the arena of}} sci-fi" [...] for Electronic Arts. [...] Lee said in 2010, [...] "I knew it was a classic <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{building}} it". Starflight had a sequel, [...] Ybarra went on to create , another space exploration adventure. [...] Reiche was inspired by the game to create Star Control, with Johnson coding three of the alien species in the game; Computer Gaming World called Star Control II a spiritual successor to Starflight. Mass Effect director Casey Hudson tweeted in 2011 that [...] "Starflight was a key inspiration for the ME series." [...] Starflight is often cited along with Elite, which appeared two years earlier with similar gameplay, as early open world space exploration games. Dwarf Fortress's forgotten beasts were inspired by the procedurally generated lifeforms within Starflight.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Godsmack {{returned}} to the studio after the multi-platinum success of Godsmack to start recording Awake. The album was released on , 2000. The album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200, and has been certified 2x platinum by the RIAA. [...] "Vampires", a song on the album, also earned the band a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2002. With the release of Awake, Godsmack toured Europe supporting Limp Bizkit. Erna said at the time, [...] "We've been touring nonstop since August 1998, So most of Awake was written on tour <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> ping-ponging between America and Europe, building up the band. [...] "Ozzfest" [...] was actually the only big tour where we rode under someone else's wings; {{we did a lot}} of work on our own." [...] The band played Ozzfest in 2000 again as they had in 1999.|$|E

500|$|Sapochnik {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} what the most difficult shot was to direct, responding [...] "The final sequence of seeing the armada {{on its way to}} Westeros was complicated because it involved so many different ships, and we only had one that we had to redress and shoot again and again. It was also raining and freezing when we shot it, and {{it was meant to be}} a Mediterranean climate. Emilia Clarke got so cold, her jaw started shaking uncontrollably and she totally lost her thread as far as what she was meant to be thinking in that moment, the cold will do that. She asked me to help, so I suggested that she just hum the theme to Game of Thrones in her head <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> rolling the cameras, and apparently that worked because it's the take we used in the final cut!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{literally}} lost my mind <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> recording," [...] stated Bemis {{regarding the}} breakdown. The breakdown was precipitated by a mockumentary discussed by Bemis and O'Heir. Bemis' condition {{led him to}} believe he was being secretly filmed for the mockumentary; the situation culminated in him walking the streets of Brooklyn thinking he was being filmed while encountering friends (who were actually strangers). After recovering, Bemis decided to focus solely on the music and dropped the idea of a script. Around July 2003, the band began recording ...Is a Real Boy, their first album with Doghouse Records. Bemis said the two people he wanted to [...] "outdo with ...Is a Real Boy were Andy Warhol and Jesus." [...] In addition to working with O'Heir and Trask, Say Anything worked with Forrest Kline (of power pop band Hellogoodbye) to record the For Sale... EP, released in 2004. The band also worked with ECA Records to record a promotional album that was never released.|$|E
500|$|... "Pest of the West" [...] is {{the first}} episode in the series that the crew used Wacom Cintiqs for the drawings, instead of pencils. Series {{background}} designer Kenny Pittenger said that [...] "the only real difference between the way we draw now {{and the way we}} drew then is that we abandoned pencil and paper during the fifth season." [...] The crew began the shift while they were working on the episode. Pittenger said that [...] "it was <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> working on 'Pest of the West', one of the half-hour specials, that we made the switch… did you notice?" [...] The shift to Wacom Cintiqs let the designers and animators draw on the computer screen and make immediate changes or undo mistakes. Pittenger said [...] "Many neo-Luddites—er… I mean, many of my cohorts—don't like working on them, but I find them useful. There's no substitute for the immediacy of drawing on a piece of paper, of course, but digital nautical nonsense is still pretty fun." ...|$|E

500|$|In addition, Firth watched archive {{footage of}} the King speaking. In an {{interview}} with Allan Tyrer published by the British Stammering Association, Swain said: [...] " [...] was very interesting <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> working on the film just to think tonally how far we could go and should go with the strength of George's stammer. I think a less courageous director than Tom [...] – and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [...] – might have {{felt the need to}} slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did." [...] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: [...] "You can probably hear even from this interview, there are moments when it’s quite infectious," [...] he said. [...] "You find yourself doing it and if I start thinking about it the worse it gets. If nothing else it’s an insight into what it feels like." ...|$|E
500|$|Louis Virtel from HitFix called [...] "Living for Love" [...] as Madonna's [...] "best video since 'Hung Up'". He found {{references}} to older Madonna videos, like [...] "Express Yourself" [...] in the [...] "unusual choreography {{with all of}} its masculine posturing and grappling", [...] "Take a Bow" [...] with its bullfighting theme and playing on a familiar imagery from her career, and [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] during the sequences where Madonna fends off the Minotaur dancers. Virtel also commended the choreography, costumes, Madonna's looks and the cinematography of the video. Along with the [...] "Take a Bow" [...] reference, Billboards Joe Lynch called the video as incredible and [...] "lush, arresting" [...] but criticized for the misspelling of Nietzsche at the end." [...] Rita Kokshanian from InStyle said that the video was [...] "just as good as you could have expected... And <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> completely transfixed by her killer moves and insane physique, we were equally in awe of her outfits." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode guest starred Omi Vaidya, {{who played}} the part of Sadiq, the IT assistant. Vaidya later {{explained}} that, originally, [...] "a lot of people auditioned for that role, bigger Indian American actors". However Vaidya, who had watched the British version and {{was familiar with the}} camera style, [...] "took a scarf, created a turban out of it and walked to the audition room with it on" [...] because he thought that [...] "that was what was needed for the character and the show". He later called his guest appearance [...] "one of the best productions in the United States that I have been a part of." [...] Vaidya said that he enjoyed shooting the party scenes the most because they got to drink real beer and play video games on an Xbox 360, which had not been released at the time. Vaidya said that [...] "it was like being at a real party with everyone from The Office except that we had to shoot a few scenes <b>while</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> chatting and relaxing." ...|$|E
