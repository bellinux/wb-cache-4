40|$|OBJECTIVE: Recent Australian and {{international}} legislation requires labeling of wines made {{by using the}} potentially allergenic food proteins casein, milk, egg white, or isinglass (fish-derived) where "there is a detectable residual processing aid. " We investigated whether <b>wines</b> <b>fined</b> using these proteins or non-grape-derived tannins (tree-nut derived) can provoke significant clinical allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) in patients with confirmed immunoglobulin E-mediated relevant food allergy. METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to determine whether allergic reactions followed consumption of Australian commercial <b>wines</b> <b>fined</b> using {{one or more of}} the legislation-targeted food proteins. In addition, allergenicity of a larger panel of these wines was evaluated by blood basophil activation. RESULTS: No anaphylaxis was induced by wine consumption. Three mild clinical reactions to protein-fined wine and two mild reactions to unfined wine occurred, but there was no statistically significant difference in reaction parameters between subject groups or between processing aids. No pattern of basophil activation correlated with wine type, processing aid, or subject group. CONCLUSION: <b>Wines</b> <b>fined</b> with egg white, isinglass, or non-grape-derived tannins present an extremely low risk of anaphylaxis to fish-, egg-, or peanut-allergic consumers. Although consumption of milk protein-fined wine did not induce anaphylaxis, there were insufficient subjects to determine statistically whether <b>wines</b> <b>fined</b> with milk proteins present a risk to the very rare milk-allergic consumers. In summary, the observed lack of anaphylaxis and basophil activation induced by wines made using the legislation-targeted food proteins according to good manufacturing practice suggests negligible residual food allergens in these wines.

40|$|Background and Aims There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in finding alternative <b>wine</b> <b>fining</b> agents to replace potentially allergenic 8 animal- and plant-derived proteins. In this context, the potential use of grape-derived fining agents would be beneficial as they would not introduce additional potentially allergenic products to the finished wine. In this project, grape seed flour, a by-product of the grape oil seed industry, {{has been used to}} prepare a grape seeds extract (GSE) to be tested as a novel <b>wine</b> <b>fining</b> agent. Methods and Results: The fining performances of GSE were compared with those of patatin, pea protein, PVPP, K 14 caseinate (in a white and in a rosè wines), ovalbumin and gelatin (in a red wine). Turbidity reduction, effects on wine color, polyphenolic content, browning potential and wine sensory attributes were determined. GSE was effective in decreasing white wine turbidity when compared to K-caseinate. In red wine, GSE removed some anthocyanins and proanthocyanins, while wine colour was only slightly affected. The greatest GSE effect was observed on the organoleptic properties of the treated wines, as it drastically reduced the vegetal notes on the rosé wine and improved the overall taste of the red wine {{as a result of the}} reduction in both acidity and astringency.

Four extracts of grape seed protein were prepared using glycine and sodium carbonate buffers at two concentrations (0. 05 and 0. 2 M, pH 10. 5). The capacity of the extracts for removing potentially astringent phenols from tannin solutions and from red wines was assessed by determining the Astringency Mucin Index. The perceived astringency intensity in tannin solutions and in two red wines treated with the extracts was evaluated by sensory tests. The Astringency Mucin Index and astringency intensity of treated samples were significantly lowered compared to that of untreated samples.

The possibility to detect residual egg proteins in red wines treated with a commercial egg white preparation was studied. By using an immunochemical method residual egg proteins were detected in the experimental red wines only for doses of fining agent of 50 g/hL or higher, whereas no residual proteins were detected by this system in a commercial red wine. A simple method based on the recovery and identification of the <b>wine</b> <b>fining</b> proteins by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) in a gel-free approach was developed. This allowed the detection of egg proteins in red wines fined down to 5 g/hL of commercial egg white preparation and also in the commercial red wine.

Three untreated white wines were used in this work in order to evaluate the impact of these novel yeast protein extracts (YPE) in terms of the wine clarification and stabilization improvement. Two separated fining trials were thus conducted at laboratory scale and the yeast alternatives were compared with reference fining agents, obtained from mineral, animal and vegetable origins. Our results indicate that yeast protein extracts were capable to promote (i) brilliance/color improvement, (ii) turbidity reduction (76 - 89 % comparing with the untreated wines) and (iii) production of compact and homogeneous lees (44 % smaller volume than obtained with bentonite).

In this study, a comparative fining trial simulating industrial procedures with 10, 20 and 30 g/hL of commercial preparations of patatin, potassium caseinate, gelatin and egg albumin on an Aglianico (Vitis vinifera L.) red wine was performed. Color indexes and phenolics were analyzed by spectrophotometric methods and HPLC. The potential astringency has been evaluated by an index based on the ability of wine to precipitate salivary proteins (SPI, Saliva Precipitation Index). Patatin is a suitable alternative to animal proteins used as fining agent because: (i) a decrease in total phenolics and tannins after the treatments with 10, 20 and 30 g/hL of commercial preparation containing P was detected; (ii) Patatin, as well as all the fining agents used in this experiment, is able to diminish astringency and the content of red wine phenolics able to react with salivary proteins. Considering all concentrations tested, the effectiveness in reducing proteins reactive towards wine polyphenols was patatin = gelatine > egg albumin > casein (p < 0. 05); (iii) at each concentration considered, the treatment with patatin causes no depletion of chromatic characteristics of red wine although a significant slight loss of individual anthocyanins was observed...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} and occurrence of aroma depletion during <b>wine</b> <b>fining</b> {{is still not}} clear. Previous results of our group led to hypothesized that some odor-active compounds were removed through direct adsorption mechanism on the clays without the involvement of any wine macromolecules. This paper examined the adsorption isotherms at 17 ± 1 °C of some volatile compounds, principally responsible of the fruity character of white wines, onto three bentonite samples. The bentonites were added in three different amounts to a model white wine “spiked” with eight odor-active compounds {{and in the absence}} of wine macromolecule. The elemental composition, the surface charge density, and the SSA of the clays were determined and differences were analyzed by Tukey’s test. The Langmuir and the Freundlich models were fitted to the adsorption data. The most experimental adsorption isotherms were robustly fitted by the Freundlich equation and evidenced differences in the adsorption intensity and capacity values for the tested odor- active compounds. The main interaction forces controlling adsorption appeared to be related more to the clay characteristics, than to the compounds properties: samples having a lower SSA value and a greater charge density per surface unit seemed to interact with most of the odor-active compounds primarily through physical mechanisms. Differently, the clay with a large SSA value and a low charge density per surface unit promoted stronger adsorptions that were probably driven also by chemical interactions especially for ethyl esters...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA method {{based on}} LC-ESI-High Resolution (HR) -MS analysis, using a single stage Orbitrap mass spectrometer, was {{developed}} for the quantification of casein allergens potentially present in white wines {{as a result of}} fining by caseinate. The method consists of i) extraction from the matrix by ultrafiltration, ii) digestion with trypsin and iii) detection/quantification of residual caseins, obtained by monitoring the LC-MS response of representative tryptic peptides (peak areas in extracted ion chromatograms). Method linearity was assessed first on caseinate solutions prepared either in water or in wine matrix (the ultrafiltration retentate of a protein-free white wine). Limits of detection (LOD) ranged from 0. 1 to 0. 3 µg/mL (S/N = 3) in water, and between 0. 15 and 0. 7 µg/mL in wine matrix, depending on the selected peptide. Method repeatability and reproducibility, meant as response variability (standard deviation) due to LC-MS analysis alone and to both enzymatic digestion and LC-MS analysis, were assessed on caseinate standard solutions in water and ranged from 5 to 12 % and from 8 to 20 %, respectively. A higher variability was usually observed for the peptide marker response in the case of matrix-matched samples, the only exception being peptide GPFPIIV from α-casein, the marker providing also the highest sensitivity. The method was finally applied to a casein-free white wine ("Greco di Tufo") fined with caseinate at different concentrations, after discarding the precipitate due to casein-wine components aggregation. Minimum detectable added caseinate concentrations (i. e. those corresponding to responses with S/N = 3) were estimated between 39 and 51 μg/mL, according to the peptide marker chosen. These limits are compatible with caseinate concentrations typically adopted for <b>wine</b> <b>fining</b> purposes. Moreover, a cross-check with the calibration performed in wine matrix led to estimate the concentration of dissolved caseinate to be in the low ng/mL range...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background European {{legislators and}} wine {{producers}} still {{debate on the}} requirement for labeling of <b>wines</b> <b>fined</b> with potentially allergenic food proteins (casein, egg white or fish-derived isinglass). We investigated whether <b>wines</b> <b>fined</b> with known concentrations of these proteins {{have the potential to}} provoke clinical allergic reactions in relevant patients. Methods In-house wines were produced for the study, fined with different concentrations of casein (n = 7), egg albumin (n = 1) and isinglass (n = 3). ELISA and PCR kits specific for the respective proteins were used to identify the fining agents. Skin prick tests and basophil activation tests were performed in patients with confirmed IgE-mediated relevant food allergies (n = 24). A wine consumption questionnaire and detailed history on possible reactions to wine was obtained in a multinational cohort of milk, egg or fish allergic patients (n = 53) and patients allergic to irrelevant foods as controls (n = 13). Results Fining agents were not detectable in wines with the available laboratory methods. Nevertheless, positive skin prick test reactions and basophil activation to the relevant wines were observed in the majority of patients with allergy to milk, egg or fish, correlating with the concentration of the fining agent. Among patients consuming wine, reported reactions were few and mild and similar with the ones reported from the control group. Conclusion Casein, isinglass or egg, remaining in traces in <b>wine</b> after <b>fining,</b> present a very low risk for the respective food allergic consumers. Physician and patient awareness campaigns may be more suitable than generalized labeling to address this issue, as the latter may have negative impact on both non-allergic and allergic consumers. </p...|$|R

40|$|Alternative {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} to counteract the drawbacks [1, 2] of bentonite, traditionally used to {{lower the risk of}} wine haze. Enzymatic degradation of wine proteins [3], ultrafiltration [4] and novel fining agents such as negatively charged polysaccharides like carragenans [5] have been proposed. The addition of chitin [6] as a specific agent for the removal of chitinase proteins would be a good choice for <b>wine</b> <b>fining,</b> but chitin is not allowed by EU regulation. Fungoid Fungine chitosan [7] from Aspergillus niger is the only type of chitosan accepted in winemaking to control Brettanomyces spp population [8], and to remove ochratoxin A and metals [9]. The effects of chitosan on wine have been insofar focused on evaluating antioxidant activity [8] and removal of procyanidins and cinnamic acids [10]. Due to its structural similarity with chitin and the activity of chitinases under wine conditions [11], chitosan could be capable to interact with grape chitinases and to remove them. This work aims to fill the lack of data concerning the effect of chitosan on the removal of proteins from wines. One Moscato wine was treated with two chitosan powders, which were characterized for the deacetylation degree, the molecular weight and the solubility. After filtration, the wine was analysed for its haze potential, proteins, total polyphenol index, Folin-Chocalteu. HPLC analyses were carried out to outline any interaction with organic acids and phenolics. Finally, GS-MS analysis quantified the free and glycosylated aroma compounds. The results showed a significant reduction of protein content and haze potential, thus indicating a positive action of chitosan as fining agent. Negligible reductions interested the total polyphenols, while significant depletions of flavons, flavan- 3 -ols and cinnamic acids occurred. Tartaric and malic were affected also, as like as free aroma compounds, whilst no difference interested the glycosylated forms...|$|E

The main goal is the clarification and decrease of phenolic compounds, regarding in particular the excess of astringency in wines. Protein fining agents used in Enology present a varied physico-chemical composition subsequently, the distribution of molecular weight and charge density influence their properties. Meanwhile, the incresing problems during the 90 s (last century) with the BSE desease, led the oenological industry, to a certain deal of concern, regarding the products used, particularly in fining agents used in wines. As a result, the subject of plant proteins for collage in wines followed the phases imposed by the OIV, Portuguese and European regulations. The present work studied the effect of fining agents from vegetable and microbiological proteins on the physico-chemichal composition in wines, in particular anthocyanins. The results were compared with the ones obtained by using bentonite and egg albumin. In the laboratory the following analyses had been made: measurements on the physico-chemical parameters of color, using Somers method, and assays of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), to verify the effect of the finning treatment on total amount of anthocyanins. In all fining agents used, there was a decrease in color intensity, total anthocyanins, colored anthocyans and tannins, although was more pronounced in non-traditional fining agents. For the chromatograms it was verified a decrease in the anthocyanin concentrations.

40|$|The {{presence}} of mycotoxins in foodstuff {{is a matter}} of concern for food safety. Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by certain molds, being ochratoxin A (OTA) one of the most relevant. Wines can also be contaminated with these toxicants. Several authors have demonstrated the {{presence of}} mycotoxins in wine, especially ochratoxin A (OTA) [1]. Its chemical structure is a dihydro-isocoumarin connected at the 7 -carboxy group to a molecule of L [...] phenylalanine via an amide bond. As these toxicants can never be completely removed from the food chain, many countries have defined levels in food in order to attend health concerns. OTA contamination of wines might be a risk to consumer health, thus requiring treatments to achieve acceptable standards for human consumption [2]. The maximum acceptable level of OTA in wines is 2. 0 g/kg according to the Commission regulation No. 1881 / 2006 [3]. Therefore, the aim of this work was to reduce OTA to safer levels using different fining agents, as well as their impact on white wine physicochemical characteristics. To evaluate their efficiency, 11 commercial fining agents (mineral, synthetic, animal and vegetable proteins) were used to get new approaches on OTA removal from white wine. Trials (including a control without addition of a fining agent) were performed in white wine artificially supplemented with OTA (10 µg/L). OTA analysis were performed after <b>wine</b> <b>fining.</b> Wine was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min and 1 mL of the supernatant was collected and added of an equal volume of acetonitrile/methanol/acetic acid (78 : 20 : 2 v/v/v). Also, the solid fractions obtained after fining, were centrifuged (4000 rpm, 15 min), the resulting supernatant discarded, and the pellet extracted with 1 mL of the above solution and 1 mL of H 2 O. OTA analysis was performed by HPLC with fluorescence detection according to Abrunhosa and Venâncio [4]. The most effective fining agent in removing OTA (80 %) from white wine was a commercial formulation that contains gelatine, bentonite and activated carbon. Removals between 10 - 30 % were obtained with potassium caseinate, yeast cell walls and pea protein. With bentonites, carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and chitosan no considerable OTA removal was verified. Following, the effectiveness of seven commercial activated carbons was also evaluated and compared with the commercial formulation that contains gelatine, bentonite and activated carbon. The different activated carbons were applied at the concentration recommended by the manufacturer in order to evaluate their efficiency in reducing OTA levels. Trial and OTA analysis were performed as explained previously. The results showed that in white wine all activated carbons except one reduced 100 % of OTA. The commercial formulation that contains gelatine, bentonite and activated carbon (C 8) reduced only 73 % of OTA concentration. These results may provide useful information for winemakers, namely for the selection of the most appropriate oenological product for OTA removal, reducing wine toxicity and simultaneously enhancing food safety and wine quality.

Six fractions consisted of proteins with isoelectric points (pIs) from 4. 27 to 3. 04. Two fractions, {{according to their}} UV spectra, seemed to contain phenolic compounds. A comparison of FPLC profiles of the must, the unfined <b>wine</b> and the <b>fined</b> <b>wine</b> indicated that both fermentation and stabilization processes decrease the concentration of those proteins with less affinity for the anion-exchange column and with a higher pi. No changes in the protein profiles of sparkling wines were observed during the first 18 months of ageing with yeast. Peer reviewe...|$|R
