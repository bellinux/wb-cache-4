40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} design {{synthesis}} methodology for dimensional management of assembly processes with compliant non-ideal parts which allows {{to integrate the}} critical and heterogeneous design tasks with conflicting or coupled objectives and design constraints such as: (1) tolerancing and variation simulation analysis (VSA); (2) fixture layout design optimization; (3) part-to-part joining process parameters selection and laser beam visibility analysis; or/and; (4) in-process measurement gauge visibility and accessibility analysis. The proposed methodology {{is based on the}} Adaptive Task Graph (ATG) that has capability to model design tasks by integrating Key Product Characteristics (KPCs) and Key Control Characteristics (KCCs) with their impact on the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs); this allows to dynamically capture interactions between design tasks as well as to generate tasks sequence. The design synthesismethodology is based on the development of: (i) assembly surrogate model linking KPCs to KCCs; (ii) sensitivity analysis with capability to model and analyse the interdependencies among design tasks and KPCs, KCCs and KPIs; and, (iii) ATG model which represents the hierarchy of design tasks and is used to generate the sequence of design tasks to minimize their interdependencies during design synthesis.
