2500|$|Polls with leading information, {{such as a}} Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg {{poll taken}} June 24–27, 2006, asking [...] "If Iran {{continues}} to produce material {{that can be used}} to develop nuclear weapons, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>support</b> or oppose the U.S. taking military action against Iran?", mostly gave minority opposition to an attack on Iran. This Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg poll gave minority (about 40 percent) opposition to an attack. A Newsweek Poll taken on October 19–20, 2006 with the leading information [...] "if that country [...] continues its efforts to develop nuclear weapons" [...] gave a large majority (76 percent) opposed to a land attack and a small majority (54 percent) opposed to an air attack, conditional on the claim in the leading information.|$|E

Every interview was held with a fixed sequence of topics, {{to check for}} potential missed needs in the questionnaire. The topics were: 1) Do you talk to others about your brother’s or sister’s condition, and <b>would</b> <b>you</b> like <b>support?</b> 2) What themes do you find important concerning your chronically ill brother or sister? 3) What should an online intervention look like? Within these topics, siblings were free to talk about anything they found important.|$|R

In 1989, when Miers was running for the Dallas City Council, she allegedly filled out a survey for the anti-abortion group Texas United for Life. The questionnaire sought to gauge candidates' feelings {{on the use of}} constitutional amendments or state laws to ban abortions in the event the Supreme Court overturned a 1973 ruling that established abortion rights. The questionnaire asked [...] "If Congress passes a Human Life Amendment to the Constitution that would prohibit abortion except when it was necessary to prevent the death of the mother, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> actively <b>support</b> its ratification by the Texas Legislature."

5000|$|The preterite {{forms of}} modals {{are used in}} {{counterfactual}} conditional sentences, in the apodosis (then-clause). The modal would (sometimes should as a first-person alternative) is used to produce the conditional construction which is typically used in clauses of this type: If you loved me, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>support</b> me. It can be replaced by could (meaning [...] "would be able to") and might (meaning [...] "would possibly") as appropriate.|$|R

The themes included in the questionnaire were identified by clinical psychologists from the Psychosocial department of Emma Children’s Hospital/Amsterdam UMC, and based on existing literature and clinical experience. The questionnaire consisted of nine items, partly open (e.g. What themes <b>would</b> <b>you</b> like discuss in online support) and partly multiple-choice (e.g. In what form <b>would</b> <b>you</b> like online <b>support).</b> All multiple-choice questions are listed in Table 2.|$|R

5000|$|The {{conditional}} mood {{is generally}} {{found in the}} independent clause (apodosis) of a conditional sentence, namely the clause that expresses {{the result of the}} condition, rather than the dependent clause (protasis) expressing the condition. The protasis will often use a different verb form, depending on the grammatical rules of the language in question, such as a past tense form or the subjunctive mood. This is exemplified by the English sentence [...] "If you loved me <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>support</b> me" [...] - here the conditional would support appears in the apodosis, while the protasis (the condition clause) uses instead the simple past form loved.|$|R

Prior to ratification, what should the United States relationship with the Court be, particularly in regards to sharing intelligence, prosecuting war criminals, and referring cases to the U.N.

As an individual, how do I weigh the short-term versus long-term advantages of investing with fellow tax payers in the local infrastructure, versus keeping more of my money and investing personally in a privately-funded, visionary transportation plan? These questions call for the types of decisions adults typically make in their work, civic, or social lives. Rather than having our students wait until they are adults to grapple with such decisions, we need to offer learning environments in which they can develop thinking habits and techniques that will serve them throughout their adult lives as they experience the unforeseen problem-solving opportunitie...|$|E

(2) Their perceptions of which youth development/community service programs would be the most beneficial to youth if these services and activities were available in their communities. (3) Their recommendation of at least one existing program which was especially effective and which could serve as an example for other communities to consider in developing their own programs and activities.

40|$|The Objectives: The European Commission has {{highlighted}} {{the use of}} sports as an important venue for engaging citizens in health-enhancing activities, physical activity, volunteerism and active citizenship. Coaching is a central component of sports for children and youth, {{but there is little}} research on the promotion of sports coaches’ health. In the light of this gap, the aim of this paper was to elucidate youth soccer coaches’ visions and thoughts regarding leadership support from clubs and soccer associations. Design and method: The study was based on an online questionnaire conducted with Swedish soccer coaches who coached children and young people between 6 and 18 years of age. In total, 1514 coaches received the online questionnaire via email and 764 coaches (50. 5 % of the sample) answered. Three hundred and seventy-five coaches answered the open question: ‘How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> describe the <b>support</b> <b>you,</b> as a coach, would like to receive from clubs and associations?’ Responses were analysed using method. Results: Four main themes emerged from the analysis: financial and other resources support, recognition of contribution, sense of belonging to a value-based association and positive coach development. Conclusion: We discuss the factors that support soccer coaches and how these can serve as health-promoting supports for coaches working with children and youth...|$|R
