5|$|The Dakota were {{hunters and}} gatherers and soon found {{themselves}} in debt to fur traders. Pressed by a <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> outbreak, loss of buffalo, deer, and bear, and loss of forests to logging, in 1851 in the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux, the Mdewakanton sold the remaining land west of the river, allowing settlement in 1852.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} free {{immunization}} programs for children, specifically targeted against the seven major diseases – smallpox, diphtheria, tetanus, yellow fever, <b>whooping</b> <b>cough,</b> polio, and measles. As of 2016, {{a total of}} 31,115 children age one and below has been “fully immunized”. The Manila Dialysis Center that provides free services for the poor has been cited by the United Nations Committee on Innovation, Competitiveness and Public-Private Partnerships {{as a model for}} public-private partnership (PPP) projects.|$|E
5|$|Tucker's {{maritime}} {{roots in}} Bermuda instilled {{an interest in}} navigation, and he began an intense campaign with the legislatures of North Carolina and Virginia to improve the waterways to Norfolk along the Roanoke, Dan, and Staunton Rivers, {{in order to avoid}} inefficient portage required to Petersburg and Richmond. This effort culminated in his own bids for election to a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates representing Pittsylvania County, which failed in 1813 and 1814 but then succeeded in 1816. Tucker and Maria then suffered the first loss of a child, Harriett, from <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> at age three.|$|E
5|$|As the 1876 presidential {{election}} approached, Garfield was {{loyal to the}} candidacy of Senator Blaine, and fought for the former Speaker's nomination at the 1876 Republican National Convention in Cincinnati. When it became clear, after six ballots, that Blaine could not prevail, the convention nominated Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes. Although Garfield had supported Blaine, he had kept good relations with Hayes, and wholeheartedly supported the governor. Garfield had hoped to retire from politics after his term expired to devote himself full-time {{to the practice of}} law, but to help his party, he sought re-election, and won it easily that October. Any celebration was short lived, as Garfield's youngest son, Neddie, fell ill with <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> shortly after the congressional election, and soon died.|$|E
5|$|African {{tribes in}} several {{countries}} have termites as totems, {{and for this reason}} tribe members are forbidden to eat the reproductive alates. Termites are widely used in traditional popular medicine; they are used as treatments for diseases and other conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, hoarseness, influenza, sinusitis, tonsillitis and <b>whooping</b> <b>cough.</b> In Nigeria, Macrotermes nigeriensis is used for spiritual protection and to treat wounds and sick pregnant women. In Southeast Asia, termites are used in ritual practices. In Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, termite mounds are commonly worshiped among the populace. Abandoned mounds are viewed as structures created by spirits, believing a local guardian dwells within the mound; this is known as Keramat and Datok Kong. In urban areas, local residents construct red-painted shrines over mounds that have been abandoned, where they pray for good health, protection and luck.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from <b>whooping</b> <b>cough.</b> Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E
25|$|Today it is {{established}} {{that at least}} some primate species are highly susceptible to B. pertussis and develop clinical <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> in high incidence when exposed to low inoculation doses. The bacteria may be present in wild animal populations, but this is not confirmed by laboratory diagnosis, although <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> is known among wild gorillas. Several zoos also have a long-standing custom of vaccinating their primates against <b>whooping</b> <b>cough.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{family is}} also known as Ptx and {{contains}} the toxin responsible for <b>whooping</b> <b>cough.</b> Pertussis toxin is secreted by the gram-negative bacterium, Bordetella pertussis. <b>Whooping</b> <b>cough</b> is very contagious and cases are slowly increasing in the United States despite vaccination. Symptoms include paroxysmal cough with whooping and even vomiting. The bacterium Bordetella pertussis was first identified as the cause of <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> and isolated by Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou in France in 1900.|$|E
25|$|In the {{vaccination}} moratorium period that occurred when Sweden suspended vaccination against <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> (pertussis) from 1979 to 1996, 60% of the country's children contracted the disease {{before the age}} of 10; close medical monitoring kept the death rate from <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> at about one per year.|$|E
25|$|In 2015 the Federal Court of Australia imposed {{penalties}} on a homeopathic company, Homeopathy Plus! Pty Ltd and its director, {{for making}} false or misleading {{statements about the}} efficacy of the <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> vaccine and homeopathic remedies {{as an alternative to the}} <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> vaccine, in breach of the Australian Consumer Law.|$|E
25|$|A 1989 report {{noted that}} common {{diseases}} in the Hazarajat included gastrointestinal infections, typhoid, <b>whooping</b> <b>cough,</b> measles, leprosy, tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis and malaria.|$|E
25|$|Maternal vaccinations while {{breastfeeding}} is {{safe for}} almost all vaccines. Additionally, the mother's immunity obtained by vaccination against tetanus, diphtheria, <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> and influenza can protect the baby from these diseases, and breastfeeding can reduce fever rate after infant immunization. However, smallpox and yellow fever vaccines {{increase the risk of}} infants developing vaccinia and encephalitis.|$|E
25|$|Uncertainties {{have existed}} of B. {{pertussis}} and <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> as a zoonotic disease since around 1910 {{but in the}} 1930s, knowledge was gained that the bacteria lost their virulent power when repeatedly spread on agar media. This explained the difficulties to reproduce results from different studies as the pre-inoculating handlings of the bacteria were not standardized among scientists.|$|E
25|$|Worldwide, <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> affects around 16 {{million people}} yearly. One {{estimate}} for 2013 stated {{it resulted in}} about 61,000 deaths – down from 138,000 deaths in 1990. Another estimated 195,000 child deaths yearly from the disease worldwide. This is despite generally high coverage with the DTP and DTaP vaccines. Pertussis {{is one of the}} leading causes of vaccine-preventable deaths worldwide. About 90% of all cases occur in developing countries.|$|E
25|$|Finland is {{considered}} successful particularly {{in regards to}} specialized medical care and the coverage of its screening and vaccination programs. Finland has a very comprehensive screening program for breast cancer where 84% of women, aged 50 to 69 years, annually take part. The vaccination program for young children is also very inclusive, as 99% of children under 2 years of age are vaccinated against <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> (pertussis) and measles.|$|E
25|$|In their match, Lenglen {{lost the}} first set 6–2 {{and just as the}} second set got underway, she began {{coughing}} and burst into tears, unable to continue. The crowd jeered her as she walked off the court, and the American press severely criticised her. This worsened when, under doctor's orders after it was confirmed that she was afflicted with <b>whooping</b> <b>cough,</b> she cancelled her exhibition match. Unaccustomed to such treatment, a devastated Lenglen went home.|$|E
25|$|Seven of Clay's {{children}} died before him. By 1835 all six daughters {{had died of}} varying causes, two when very young, two as children, and the last two as young women: from <b>whooping</b> <b>cough,</b> yellow fever, and complications of childbirth, respectively. Henry Clay, Jr. was killed during the Mexican–American War at the Battle of Buena Vista. Clay's oldest son, Theodore, spent {{the second half of}} his life confined to a psychiatric hospital.|$|E
25|$|B. {{pertussis}} {{was discovered}} in 1906 by Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou, who also developed the first serology and vaccine. Efforts to develop an inactivated whole-cell vaccine began soon after B. pertussis was cultured that year. In the 1920s, Louis W. Sauer developed a weak vaccine for <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> at Evanston Hospital (Evanston, IL). In 1925 Danish physician Thorvald Madsen {{was the first to}} test a whole-cell vaccine on a wide scale. Madsen used the vaccine to control outbreaks in the Faroe Islands in the North Sea.|$|E
25|$|As {{summarized}} in various stories, Lois {{was born to}} Sam and Ella Lane and grew up on their farm {{in the small town}} of Pittsdale. While Lois was a toddler, she encountered a rattlesnake in the woods near the Lane family farm. The snake was scared away by one of Kal-El's baby toys which had landed nearby in one of Jor-El's experimental rockets. At the age of two, Lois suffered measles, and at the age of three, <b>whooping</b> <b>cough.</b> At an unspecified time during Lois' childhood, her younger sister Lucy Lane was born.|$|E
25|$|In a 1974 report ascribing 36 {{reactions}} to <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> (pertussis) vaccine, a prominent public-health academic {{claimed that the}} vaccine was only marginally effective and questioned whether its benefits outweigh its risks, and extended television and press coverage caused a scare. Vaccine uptake in the UK decreased from 81% to 31%, and pertussis epidemics followed, leading {{to the deaths of}} some children. Mainstream medical opinion continued to support the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine; public confidence was restored after the publication of a national reassessment of vaccine efficacy. Vaccine uptake then increased to levels above 90%, and disease incidence declined dramatically.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of Captain Cook's arrival in 1778, the {{population}} is estimated to have been between 250,000 and 800,000. Over the span of the first century after first contact, the native Hawaiians were nearly wiped out by diseases introduced to the islands. Native Hawaiians had no resistance to influenza, smallpox, measles, or <b>whooping</b> <b>cough,</b> among others. The 1900 U.S. Census identified 37,656 residents of full or partial native Hawaiian ancestry. The 2000 U.S. Census identified 283,430 residents of Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander ancestry, showing a dramatic growth trend since annexation by the U.S. in 1898.|$|E
25|$|Health {{care was}} another {{area where the}} Sandinistas made {{significant}} improvements and are widely recognized for this accomplishment, e.g. by Oxfam. In this area Cuba {{also played a role}} by again offering expertise to Nicaragua. Over 1,500 Cuban doctors worked in Nicaragua and provided more than five million consultations. Cuban personnel were essential in the elimination of polio, the decrease in <b>whooping</b> <b>cough,</b> rubella, measles and the lowering of the infant mortality rate. Gary Prevost states that Cuban personnel made it possible for Nicaragua to have a national health care system that reached the majority of its citizens.|$|E
25|$|Johnnie Mae Young {{was born}} in Sand Springs, Oklahoma on March 12, 1923. She was the {{youngest}} of eight children (one died at birth). Her mother Lilly Mae Young was a single mother (her partner left to find work and never returned) living during the Great Depression. Young's oldest sister Inie was severely disabled by <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> at a very young age. Young was an amateur wrestler on her high school's boys' wrestling team at the age of fifteen. Her brothers Fred, Eugen, Lawarence, and Everett taught her to wrestle and helped her join the team. Young also played softball with Tulsa's national championship team.|$|E
25|$|Printed catalogs {{published}} in 1825 and 1830 listed 3,905 and 5,239 titles respectively. These catalogs contain {{the kinds of}} titles that might be expected in a foreign affairs library: The Ambassador and His Functions... Lewis and Clark-Travels to the Source of the Missouri River and across the American Continent to the Pacific Ocean, London, 1814. But they also contain such titles as Hall's Distiller, Philadelphia, 1818; Denman-Practice of Midwifery, New York, 1821; and Waterhouse-On <b>Whooping</b> <b>Cough,</b> Boston, 1822, which were probably received unsolicited on deposit. The books in the catalogues of 1825 and 1830 are arranged by broad subject areas, but the alphabetic arrangement within those areas is somewhat haphazard.|$|E
25|$|Lenglen {{arrived in}} New York City {{the day before}} the tournament after a stormy and delayed sea voyage, during which she was ill the whole time. Upon arrival, Lenglen learned that, without her permission, tournament {{officials}} had announced her participation in the US Championships. Because of immense public pressure, she agreed to play in the tournament despite suffering from what was diagnosed later as <b>whooping</b> <b>cough.</b> As a concession, she was given a day to recover. To her surprise, there was no seeding for the event and her name had been drawn to play Eleanor Goss, a leading American player. Goss immediately defaulted, leaving Lenglen to face Mallory in the second round as her first opponent.|$|E
25|$|When Caine {{was nine}} he lost {{two of his}} young sisters within a year. Five year old Sarah {{developed}} hydrocephaly after a fever. Fourteen month old Emma died in convulsions brought on by <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> she caught from him and his brother John. Caine was {{to be sent to}} the Isle of Man to recover from his illness and grief. He was put on a boat to Ramsey by his father, with a label pinned on his coat and assurances that his uncle would meet him. A fierce storm occurred preventing the ferry from reaching land. Caine was rescued by a large rowing boat. He would later draw on this experience when writing the scene in The Bondman in which Stephen Orry is cast ashore there.|$|E
25|$|The VICP {{covers all}} {{vaccines}} {{listed on the}} Vaccine Injury Table maintained by the Secretary of Health and Human Services; in 2007 the list included vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (<b>whooping</b> <b>cough),</b> measles, mumps, rubella (German measles), polio, hepatitis B, varicella (chicken pox), Haemophilus influenzae type b, rotavirus, and pneumonia. From 1988 until 8 January 2008, 5,263 claims relating to autism, and 2,865 non-autism claims, {{were made to the}} VICP. 925 of these claims, one autism-related (see previous rulings), were compensated, with 1,158 non-autism and 350 autism claims dismissed; awards (including attorney's fees) totaled $847 million. The VICP also applies to claims for injuries suffered before 1988; there were 4,264 of these claims of which 1,189 were compensated with awards totaling $903 million.|$|E
25|$|Most infections with {{adenovirus}} {{result in}} infections {{of the upper}} respiratory tract. Adenovirus infections often show up as conjunctivitis, tonsilitis (which may look exactly like strep throat and cannot be distinguished from strep except by throat culture), an ear infection, or croup. Adenoviruses, types 40 and 41 can also cause gastroenteritis. A combination of conjunctivitis and tonsilitis is particularly common with adenovirus infections. Some children (especially small ones) can develop adenovirus bronchiolitis or pneumonia, both {{of which can be}} severe. In babies, adenoviruses can also cause coughing fits that look almost exactly like <b>whooping</b> <b>cough.</b> Adenoviruses can also cause viral meningitis or encephalitis. Rarely, adenovirus can cause hemorrhagic cystitis (inflammation of the urinary bladder—a form of urinary tract infection — with blood in the urine).|$|E
25|$|Decatur came to {{love the}} sea and sailing in a {{roundabout}} manner. When Stephen was eight years old, he developed a severe case of <b>whooping</b> <b>cough.</b> In those days, a supposed tonic for this condition was exposure to the salt air of the sea. It was decided that Stephen Jr. would accompany his father aboard a merchant ship on his next voyage to Europe. Sailing across the Atlantic and back {{proved to be an}} effective remedy, and Decatur came home completely recovered. In the days following young Stephen's return he was jubilant about his adventure on the high sea and spoke of wanting to go sailing often. His parents had different aspirations, especially his mother who had hopes that Stephen would one day become an Episcopal clergyman, and tried to discourage the eight-year-old from such jaunty ambitions, fearing such would distract Stephen from his studies.|$|E
25|$|In 1932 an {{outbreak}} of <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> hit Atlanta, Georgia, prompting pediatrician Leila Denmark to begin her study of the disease. Over {{the next six years}} her work was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, and in partnership with Emory University and Eli Lilly & Company, she developed the first pertussis vaccine. In 1942 American scientists Grace Eldering, Loney Gordon, and Pearl Kendrick combined the whole-cell pertussis vaccine with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids to generate the first DTP combination vaccine. To minimize the frequent side effects caused by the pertussis component, Japanese scientist Yuji Sato developed an acellular vaccine consisting of purified haemagglutinins (HAs: filamentous strep throat and leucocytosis-promoting-factor HA), which are secreted by B. pertussis. Sato's acellular pertussis vaccine was used in Japan starting in 1981. Later versions of the acellular vaccine in other countries consisted of additional defined components of B. pertussis and were often part of the DTaP combination vaccine.|$|E
25|$|Schools in Newfoundland, {{especially}} in outport settlements, faced many problems and obstacles. The {{success of the}} schools {{was influenced by the}} conditions within the settlement, and these conditions often affected student attendance, payments, learning, and so forth. For example, conditions which affected the population were such things as illnesses (or epidemics) such as the flu, fever, <b>whooping</b> <b>cough,</b> smallpox, measles, etc. The weather also posed problems, severe snowstorms in the winter months often closed schools for days; and if the weather was too cold, children could not make it to school or could not keep the school in fuel for heat. The fishery affected the school and its attendance greatly. During the fishing season, children were often needed to help out in the fishery and could not attend school. Also, in smaller settlements, the teacher was allowed to attend the fishery in order to supplement their low teaching salaries; therefore, closing the school during that season. A failure in the fishery also had severe consequences as parents could not pay subscriptions to the school. Poverty also led to a lack of clothes and shoes which meant children could not be sent to school. The N.S.S., unlike other schools, tried their best to counter these obstacles. For example, the N.S.S. would send shipments of clothes and shoes from England to Newfoundland to give to poverty-stricken families so their children could continue to attend school. Also, other schools in Newfoundland had trouble procuring and paying qualified teachers. The N.S.S., however, were able to recruite qualified teachers who were trained at the National School Society Training School in England {{and they were able to}} pay their teachers better salaries.|$|E
500|$|Beside these {{prominent}} figures, {{many of the}} St John's graves contain children. [...] Typhoid and <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> epidemics took heavy tolls in the Victorian period. [...] Although Ashfield {{was known}} as a healthy area, many families lost two or even three children.|$|E
500|$|Sundews {{were used}} as {{medicinal}} herbs {{as early as the}} 12th century, when an Italian doctor from the School of Salerno, Matthaeus Platearius, described the plant as an herbal remedy for coughs under the name herba sole. It has been used commonly in cough preparations in Germany and elsewhere in Europe. Sundew tea was especially recommended by herbalists for dry coughs, bronchitis, <b>whooping</b> <b>cough,</b> asthma and [...] "bronchial cramps". A modern study has shown that Drosera exhibits antitussive properties.|$|E
500|$|Culbreth's 1927 Materia Medica listed D. rotundifolia, D. anglica and D.linearis {{as being}} used as stimulants and expectorants, and [...] "of {{doubtful}} efficacy" [...] for treating bronchitis, <b>whooping</b> <b>cough,</b> and tuberculosis. [...] Sundews have also been used as an aphrodisiac and to strengthen the heart, {{as well as to}} treat sunburn, toothache, and prevent freckles. They are still used today in some 200-300 registered medications, usually in combination with other herbal ingredients. Today, Drosera is usually used to treat ailments such as asthma, coughs, lung infections, and stomach ulcers.|$|E
500|$|Fawn early {{demonstrated}} precociousness. At three she memorized and recited lengthy poems. When a <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> epidemic convinced Brodie's {{mother to}} homeschool Fawn's sister Flora, who {{was two years}} older, Fawn more than kept pace. Introduced to school in 1921, the six-year-old Fawn was advanced to the fourth grade; when she lost the school spelling bee to a twelve-year-old, [...] "she cried and cried that this bright boy, twice her age, had spelled her down." [...] At ten she had a poem printed in the LDS youth periodical, The Juvenile Instructor; at fourteen she was salutatorian of Weber High School.|$|E
500|$|In 1784, the widower Thomas Jefferson was {{appointed}} the American envoy to France; {{he took his}} oldest daughter Martha (Patsy) with him to Paris, {{as well as some}} of the people he held as his personal slaves. Among them was Sally's older brother James Hemings, who became trained as a chef in French cuisine. Jefferson left his two younger daughters in the care of friends in the US. After Lucy died of <b>whooping</b> <b>cough</b> in 1787, Jefferson sent for his surviving daughter, nine-year-old Maria (Polly) Jefferson, to live with him. The teenage slave Sally Hemings was chosen to accompany Polly to France after an older slave became pregnant and could not make the journey. Originally, Jefferson arranged for Polly to [...] "be in the care of her nurse, a black woman, to whom she is confided with safety" [...] [...] According to Abigail Adams, [...] "The old Nurse whom you expected to have attended her, was sick and unable to come.
