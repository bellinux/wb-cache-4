500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the film Viva Las Vegas (1964). The panic and smoke cloud generated from the implosion of Mr Burns' casino is reminiscent of the 1997 disaster film Dante's Peak, and the Simpson family's escape from the smoke cloud is {{a reference to}} a scene in the 1996 science fiction film Independence Day. Outside Rev. Lovejoy's church is a notice that today's sermon will be 'He Knows <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Did</b> Last Summer', which is {{a reference to the}} title of the 1997 slasher film I Know <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Did</b> Last Summer. As Homer and Ned escape from Vegas, a snippet of the theme from the 1996 comic science fiction film Mars Attacks! can be heard. The Comic Book Guy's license plate is NCC-1701, which is also the registration of the USS Enterprise, a fictional starship from the Star Trek media franchise. He also has a bumper sticker which reads [...] "my other car is the Millennium Falcon" [...] which was given to him by somebody who looked like the actor Harrison Ford; the Millennium Falcon was the ship used by Ford's character Han Solo in the Star Wars film series. The line Homer gives after Ned signs the contract is a reference to the 1997 film The Game.|$|E

500|$|Killing Mr. Griffin {{was first}} {{published}} in April 1978 by Little, Brown and Company in hardcover. In October 2010, Little, Brown reissued the novel in paperback with updates to modernize some of the content. Killing Mr. Griffin, along with I Know <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Did</b> Last Summer and Don't Look Behind You, were the first group of ten different titles that were updated and reissued with these changes. An audiobook was released by Listening Library in 1986, and another, read by Ed Sala, was released by Recorded Books in 1998. A reviewer from AudioFile felt that Sala's narration was effective, although occasionally he [...] "seems to lose concentration and expression." [...] A 2010 audiobook, narrated by Dennis Holland, was published by Hachette Audio and features the modernized text.|$|E
500|$|When Diane first played me {{what she}} had begun with the song, I needed no convincing about the record... it was about sharing that part of myself with the world...

I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you can hurt me? You don't know about power. Because after <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> to me, you don't even know how much stronger I am.' ...|$|E
500|$|Fellini was {{particularly}} taken with Basehart, who reminded {{the director of}} Charlie Chaplin.

[...] A great success in Italy, the 1951 Hollywood drama starred Basehart as a would-be suicide on a hotel balcony. Basehart, too, had been greatly impressed by I Vitelloni, and agreed to take the role for much less than his usual salary, in part because he was very attracted by Fellini's personality, saying: [...] "It was his zest for living, and his humor." ...|$|E
