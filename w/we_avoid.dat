Positive consequentialism demands that we bring about good states of affairs, whereas negative consequentialism requires that <b>we</b> <b>avoid</b> bad ones. Stronger versions of negative consequentialism will require active intervention to prevent bad and ameliorate existing harm. In weaker versions, simple forbearance from acts tending to harm others is sufficient. An example of this is the Slippery Slope Argument, which encourages others to avoid a specified act {{on the grounds that it}} may ultimately lead to undesirable consequences.|$|E

Explaining the change, designer Martin Lambie-Nairn said that [...] "by choosing a typeface that has {{stood the test of}} time, <b>we</b> <b>avoid</b> the trap of going down a modish route that might look outdated in several years' time". The BBC had an earlier association with Gill, who created some sculptures on Broadcasting House. Other more recent British organisations using Gill Sans have included Railtrack (and initially its successor Network Rail), John Lewis and the Church of England, which adopted Gill Sans as the typeface for the definitive Common Worship family of service books published from 2000. Notable non-British modern businesses using Gill Sans include United Colours of Benetton (which commissioned a custom variant), Tommy Hilfiger and Saab Automobile. British rock band Bloc Party has used Gill Sans in its logo. AT used it until 2006, before changing it to Clearview after feeling that it was too in keeping with market research that people found the company [...] "monolithic". Edward Tufte, the information design theorist, uses Gill Sans on his website and in some of his published works. The Wikimedia Foundation uses Gill Sans on its wordmark.|$|E

2500|$|The classic Anselmian {{formulation}} of the satisfaction view should be distinguished from penal substitution. Both are forms of satisfaction theory in that they speak of how Christ's death was satisfactory, but penal substitution and Anselmian satisfaction offer different understandings of how Christ's death was satisfactory. Anselm speaks of human sin as defrauding God of the honour he is due. Christ's death, the ultimate act of obedience, brings God great honour. As it was {{beyond the call of}} duty for Christ, it is more honour than he was obliged to give. Christ's surplus can therefore repay our deficit. Hence Christ's death is substitutionary; he pays the honour to the Father instead of us paying. Penal substitution differs in that it sees Christ's death not as repaying God for lost honour but rather paying the penalty of death that had always been the moral consequence for sin (e.g., [...] ). The key difference here is that for Anselm, satisfaction is an alternative to punishment, [...] "The honor taken away must be repaid, or punishment must follow." [...] By Christ satisfying our debt of honor to God, <b>we</b> <b>avoid</b> punishment. In Calvinist Penal Substitution, it is the punishment which satisfies the demands of justice.|$|E
