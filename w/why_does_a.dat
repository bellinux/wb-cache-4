[...] The answer is that the child does not start with [...] "Chinese", or any other conventionally defined language, in its head. The child does start with general grammatical rules that determine linguistic properties.|$|E

2500|$|Like Dutch {{football}} in general until the mid-1960s, Cruyff's early playing career was considerably influenced by coaching philosophy of British/English coaches such as Vic Buckingham. However, his footballing philosophy shares more similar aspects to free-flowing style of South American football (Brazilian {{football in}} particular) than traditional British/Anglo-Saxon school of football (with distinctively direct, aggressive, heavily athletic, muscular, physical elements in coaching and playing style). The mind-body duality always {{plays an important}} role in his footballing philosophy. In Cruyff’s words, quoted in Dennis Bergkamp's autobiography Stillness and Speed: My Story, “...Because you play football with your head, and your legs are there to help you. If you don't use your head, using your feet won't be sufficient. <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> player have to chase the ball? Because he started running too late. You have to pay attention, use your brain and find the right position. If you get to the ball late, it means you chose the wrong position. Bergkamp was never late.” For Cruyff, football (the so-called beautiful game) is much an artistic-oriented mind-body game instead of an athletic-oriented physical competition. As he put it, [...] "Every trainer talks about movement, about running a lot. I say don't run so much. Football is a game you play with your brain. You have to be in the right place at the right moment, not too early, not too late." [...] The creativity is always the key element in his footballing philosophy, both as a player and as a manager. Cruyff once compared his more intuitive and individualistic approach with Louis van Gaal's more mechanized and rigid coaching style, “Van Gaal has a good vision on football. But it's not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics. I don't. I want individuals to think for themselves and take the decision on the pitch that is best for the situation... I don't have anything against computers, but you judge football players intuitively and with your heart. On the basis of the criteria which are now in use at Ajax [...] I would have failed the test. When I was 15, I could barely kick the ball 15 metres with my left and with the right maybe 20 metres. I would not have been able to take a corner. Besides, I was physically weak and relatively slow. My two qualities were great technique and insight, which happen to be two things you can’t measure with a computer.” ...|$|E

40|$|Anthropomorphizing {{nature is}} a {{powerful}} and pervasive cognitive tendency. The present experiment examined whether existential concerns are implicated in this tendency. Nonreligious and religious Christian {{participants were asked to}} assign human characteristics to two natural objects, one benign (a tree), and one potentially threatening (a volcano). Reminders of death reduced the tendency to anthropomorphize both objects. The volcano was anthropomorphized less than the tree. These findings are examined in light of two hypotheses regarding the role of existential concerns in anthropomorphizing nature. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> people see faces in clouds, hear voices in the winds, and decipher human silhouettes on rocks and trees? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> 10 –year-old grilled cheese sandwich in the likeness of the Virgin Mary fetch $ 28000 in U.
