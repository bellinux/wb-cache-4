500|$|While Bush {{endorsed}} the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, {{he declined to}} endorse the 2016 Republican nominee Donald Trump {{and he did not}} attend the 2016 Republican National Convention, which formally nominated Trump. On the eve of Trump's nomination, it was reported that Bush had privately expressed concern about the current direction of the Republican Party and told a group of his former aides and advisors, [...] "I'm <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will be the last Republican president." [...] Bush and his wife Laura did not vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election according to a spokesperson for the Bush family, instead choosing to leave their presidential ballots blank. After the election, Bush, his father, and his brother Jeb called Trump on the phone to congratulate him on his victory. Both he and Laura attended Trump's inauguration, and images of Bush struggling to put on a rain poncho during the ceremony became an internet meme.|$|E
500|$|In the 1996 musical, Evita, Madonna {{played the}} title role of Eva Perón. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Perón and wrote to {{director}} Alan Parker to explain why she would be perfect for the part. She said later, [...] "This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of me into this because {{it was much more}} than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time. And I am prouder of Evita than anything else I have done." [...] After securing the role, she had vocal training and learned about the history of Argentina and Perón. During shooting she became ill several times due to the intense emotional effort required. However, as she told Oprah Winfrey, she was also pregnant during the filming: [...] "I was winded after every take. I had to lie on the couch every ten minutes so I could recover from dizzy spells, I was <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was shaking the baby around too much and that would injure it in some way." [...] Madonna wrote in her personal diary at the time: [...] "Ironically, this feeling of vulnerability and weakness is helping me in the movie. I'm sure Evita felt this way every day of her life once she discovered she was ill." ...|$|E

I went to Olympic Trials that year (2004) with Kyla [...] I remember seeing the gymnasts on the floor and I loved all of their leotards. I thought they were so little and so amazing.

You'll look beautiful. We have a very limited budget but honest, you'll be proud.' And it was bad, very bad. At least that was what I was told. After watching the first two minutes I had {{to turn it off}} and hide under the covers." ...|$|E

30|$|In the {{examination}} of FLLA, 18 (49.49 %) understudies picked “agree” when responding the item “I get nervous if a listening passage is read only once during English listening tests”; 17 (46.46 %) students selected “agree” in the item “when a person speaks English very fast, <b>I</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might not understand all of it”; however, 17 (46.46 %) students select “strongly agree” in the item “I get worried when I have little {{time to think about}} what I hear in English.” Thus, anxiety is ubiquitous and universal in EFL listening comprehension.|$|R

"I {{was a kind}} of good jack-of-all trades, {{which could}} be very dull indeed except for the one thing I did have, {{probably}} the thing Diana had seen in Cincinnati: I could move, and if I could incorporate what Balanchine wanted with my movement, it might blossom into something - it could be anything. <b>I</b> think <b>that</b> was interesting to Balanchine.

6000|$|Then, I {{was sent}} to a great, cold, bare, school of big boys; where {{everything}} to eat and wear was thick and clumpy, without being enough; where everybody, largo and small, was cruel; where the boys knew all about the sale, before I got there, and asked me what I had fetched, and who had bought me, and hooted at me, [...] "Going, going, gone!" [...] I never whispered in that wretched place that I had been Haroun, or had had a Seraglio: for, I knew that if I mentioned my reverses, I should be so <b>worried,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should have to drown myself in the muddy pond near the playground, which looked like the beer.|$|E

We couldn't make out the words but Diana says she knows they were swearing by the sound of them. I can't believe that of Mr. Blair, for he is always so quiet and meek; but at least he had great provocation, for Marilla, when that poor man came to the door, red as a beet, with perspiration streaming down his face, he had on one of his wife's big gingham aprons. 'I can't get this durned thing off,' he said, 'for the strings are tied in a hard knot and I can't bust 'em, so you'll have to excuse me, ladies.' We begged him not to mention it and went in and sat down. Mr. Blair sat down too; he twisted the apron around to his back and rolled it up, but he did look so ashamed and <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt sorry for him, and Diana said she feared we had called at an inconvenient time.

My wife got a telegram today that her sister from Montreal is coming tonight and she's gone to the train to meet her and left orders for me to make a cake for tea.

30|$|Participants’ anticipatory {{challenge}} and threat appraisals of the mathematics task were assessed with {{a reliable and}} validated measure of cognitive appraisals by Skinner and Brewer (2002). Participants indicated their agreement with 16 statements addressing their thoughts about the mathematics task that {{they are about to}} complete, such as “I am focusing on the positive aspects of the mathematics task” (challenge appraisal), and “I <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will say or do the wrong thing in the mathematics task” (threat appraisal). Responses were rated on a 6 -point Likert-type scale (1 “strongly disagree” to 6 “strongly agree”). Relevant items were averaged to produce total challenge, and total threat appraisal scores (Skinner and Brewer 2002), with higher scores representing a stronger appraisal for that subscale. Acceptable item reliability was achieved in the present study for both challenge (α = . 88) and threat (α = . 94) appraisal subscales.|$|R
