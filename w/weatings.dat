40|$|Wheat bran, a {{co-product}} of {{the industrial}} roller milling of wheat, {{can be added to}} food products such as bread because of its nutritional profile and physiological effects. However, incorporation of wheat bran in bread systems can negatively affect final product quality. Next to possible taste issues, bran-enriched bread modifies crumb texture and shows a lower loaf volume as compared to white bread. Some intrinsic bran properties are believed to play a considerable role in this quality reduction. These properties can be either physical, chemical or biochemical in nature. However, the actual contribution and relative importance of each of these properties to decreased bread quality is a matter of debate. To counteract the negative effects of bran on bread quality, bran-enriched products can be supplemented with gluten, emulsifiers or other improvers, which are generally relatively expensive. Clear understanding of the relationship between bran composition and structure, bran properties and bran impact on bread making is, however, still missing. Against this background, this dissertation investigates the relationship between intrinsic bran properties and their effect on bread making, and aims to provide insight in the causes of the quality loss upon incorporation of bran in bread. To this end, bran fractions differing in intrinsic properties were produced using either a roller milling or a pearling process, and related to their effect on bread making. Both processes were used to obtain bran fractions with different properties, and were themselves not studied in detail in this dissertation. Next to this, more in-depth research into the impact of the physical presence of wheat bran particles and bran water binding capacity during bran-enriched bread making was executed. In a first experimental part of this thesis, the properties of bran fractions, produced by roller milling or by pearling and their impact on bread making was investigated. With both explorative approaches, a first view was obtained on the relationship between bran constituents, enzyme activity levels, steric hindrance, and hydration properties on the one hand, and bread volume and textural quality on the other hand. Four industrial roller milling fractions - coarse bran, coarse <b>weatings,</b> fine <b>weatings,</b> and low grade flour - were studied. All co-products differed in chemical composition, enzyme activity levels, particle size, and hydration properties. To relate these properties with the effect of co-products on bread making, meals consisting of flour and co-products were composed on a same overall starch level to compensate for differences in endosperm contamination in the co-products. While uncommon, this approach seemed appropriate here, as the co-products differed strongly in botanical bran content. Bread specific volume was more strongly depressed with fine <b>weatings</b> and low grade flour than with coarse bran and coarse <b>weatings.</b> While this suggests that the properties of the former were intrinsically more detrimental to bread volume than those of the latter, it was not clear which properties were responsible for this, as the variability between the different co-products was relatively high. More insight in the contribution of bran properties on bread quality was gained when wheat bran was mechanically treated through abrasive pearling (also referred to as debranning). Pearling is a more specific, bran-directed treatment than roller milling, producing bran fractions with a similar particle size distribution (in contrast to the different milling co-products), but with a broader variation in other properties amongst each other. Pearling fractions P 0 - 3 %, P 3 - 6 %, P 6 - 9 % and P 9 - 12 %, obtained after pearling to 3, 6, 9 and 12 % by weight, strongly differed in composition, hydration properties, enzymatic load, and chemical reactivity. Pericarp-rich fraction P 0 - 3 %, having the highest water binding capacity among the fractions, had the most adverse effects on bread quality, whereas addition of aleurone-rich fraction P 6 - 9 %, having low water binding capacities, had less adverse effects on bread properties. To investigate the contribution of bran-associated enzymes on bread quality loss, a heat treated versus a native P 0 - 3 % fraction, the latter having a high bran-associated enzymatic activity, were compared. The results showed that bran-associated enzymes can clearly affect both the Hagberg Falling Number of meal and bread crumb textural properties. The reducing power of bran-associated chemical components, finally, is probably less determinative as compared to other properties. Overall, results from {{the first part of the}} experimental work suggested that bran hydration is a key element that determines its impact on bread making, but further research was needed in this dissertation to confirm and underpin this. Hence, in a second part of this dissertation, the effect of hydration properties and the steric effect of bran particles on different parts of the bread making process were studied more in-depth. Regular coarse and ground bran, synthetic bran-like particles with no water binding capacity, and pericarp-enriched bran particles were incorporated in a bread recipe, and their effect on bread making was studied. Dough with synthetic bran displayed a near to normal oven rise and resulted in a smaller loaf volume decrease as compared to the breads containing regular and pericarp-enriched bran, strengthening the hypothesis that water binding by bran affects the bread making process the most. Besides, grinding of regular bran and synthetic bran did not change their impact compared to coarse particles, suggesting that steric hindrance by the physical presence of bran particles is of less importance. Finally, the molecular mobility of water and biopolymers in coarse, ground, and pericarp-enriched wheat bran and refined flour was studied using time-domain proton nuclear magnetic resonance (TD 1 H NMR) relaxometry, and related to their hydration properties. These insights were used to assess water mobility and biopolymer behavior during bran-enriched bread making and subsequent storage. Bran incorporation in dough resulted in a progressive immobilization of water during dough resting, which was not observed in the white control dough. This could be linked to changes in evolution of dough height during fermentation and oven rise. This, together with modified starch gelatinization behavior upon baking, seems at least partly responsible for the lower loaf volume and inferior crumb texture properties in bran-rich breads. Textural quality during storage was less affected for bran-rich bread compared to wheat flour bread. The latter could be principally attributed to retardation of amylopectin retrogradation during bread storage in the presence of bran. In conclusion, this dissertation studied the functional relevance and contribution to quality loss of the enzymatic load, chemical reactivity, steric hindrance and water binding capacity of wheat bran in bran-enriched bread making. Bran-associated enzymes did not affect loaf volume when fermentable substrate was abundantly present, but were functionally relevant with regard to Hagberg Falling Number and crumb textural properties. Reducing compounds from bran had limited impact on bread making. The hydration properties of bran are believed to be a key element in the deleterious effect of bran on bread quality. This could be due to modifications in dough rheology during leavening and starch gelatinization behavior during baking, leading to a negligible oven rise when flour is replaced by bran. This effect was independent of the size of bran particles. The knowledge of the actual contribution and functional relevance of bran properties during bread making obtained in this dissertation allows bran-centered approaches to enhance the nutritional value and physiological benefits of bread with mitigated quality loss. status: publishe...|$|E
