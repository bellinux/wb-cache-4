500|$|I'm {{always going}} {{to fall back on}} 'we were ahead of our time,' because it's easy. The biggest thing <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> an all or nothing {{proposal}} from an entertainment point of view. It's not like you can start up a new TV network and give one show a month and expect it to be successful... We couldn't quite pull that off with the money we had." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Bruce, [...] "Some people might've been upset , {{but through}} our eyes all <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> touch {{a lot of}} people. We {{definitely}} {{wanted it to be}} something everlasting. Maybe a 19-year-old might not understand or like that ending now. But later, when he has four kids, he might think, 'That was the shit.'" [...] Following the release of The Wraith: Shangri-La, Bruce and Utsler signed a new contract with Sony BMG's RED Distribution and launched the Psychopathic Europe record label.|$|E
500|$|In late 1987, Slayer {{returned}} to the studio to record their fourth studio album. To contrast the speed of Reign in Blood, the band consciously decided {{to slow down the}} tempos, and incorporate more melodic singing. According to Hanneman, [...] "We knew we couldn't top Reign in Blood, so we had to slow down. We knew whatever <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> gonna be compared to that album, and I remember we actually discussed slowing down. It was weird—we've never done that on an album, before or since." ...|$|E

[...] King countered that [...] "if you're {{inferring}} that what <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> luck, I don't agree with you sir because I think we weren't lucky, we were just bloody good." [...] Vasey replied that what he meant was that he, Vasey, was lucky. He confided to Herring that {{he felt that he}} had made a potentially disastrous mistake: [...] "it is quite wrong to send out a small unit like the 2/6th Independent Company so far that they cannot be supported." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{started to}} work with Mirwais Ahmadzaï {{with whom she had}} {{previously}} developed her eighth album Music (2000). However, that collaboration did not suit Madonna's musical direction. According to Madonna, [...] " [...] Mirwais is also very political, seriously cerebral and intellectual. All <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> sit around, talking politics all the time. So, that couldn't help but find its way into the music. I think there's an angry aspect to the music that directly reflects my feelings at the time." [...] Hence after recording tracks with Mirwais, Madonna decided to stop the project and start fresh. It was then that she turned to Stuart Price who had served as musical director on her two previous concert tours and co-wrote one song on American Life.|$|E
500|$|Corporal Sam Jenkins and PFC Preston were {{captured}} {{before they reached}} Allied lines, and they later joined Bouck {{and the rest of}} the platoon in prison. The men barely survived, most suffering from the advanced effects of malnutrition. When Task Force Baum from Patton's 4th Armored Division attempted to liberate the camp, Captain Abe Baum was surprised at the large number of prisoners and was unable to rescue them all. Almost all of Baum's unit was captured; Bouck was recaptured and was finally released one week before the war ended. He was too weak to file a combat report, and hospitalized for several months after the war ended. He did not think his men had accomplished that much. [...] "We were in those foxholes and ... what <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> to defend ourselves and try to live through it." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the last}} {{evening of the}} visit, as they lie in their {{respective}} beds, the chief protagonists muse on their personal histories in a surreal series of interwoven dialogues. Nixon and Pat recall the struggles of their youth; Nixon evokes wartime memories ("Sitting round the radio"). Mao and Chiang Ch'ing dance together, as the Chairman remembers [...] "the tasty little starlet" [...] who came to his headquarters {{in the early days}} of the revolution. As they reminisce, Chiang Ch'ing asserts that [...] "the revolution must not end". Chou meditates alone; the opera finishes on a thoughtful note with his aria [...] "I am old and I cannot sleep", asking: [...] "How much of what <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> good?" [...] The early morning birdcalls are summoning him to resume his work, while [...] "outside this room the chill of grace lies heavy on the morning grass".|$|E
500|$|Production {{designer}} Loren Weeks described Marvel's Hell's Kitchen {{as having}} [...] "a little more [...] Village quality." [...] To achieve the explosion at Luke's Bar, Weeks said, [...] "We {{could not take}} out the windows , which are [...] multiple small colored glass and metal frames. We didn’t know frankly when we picked that location {{that we would have}} that explosion... What <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> build a fireproof box in the entrance and we had a cannon in there which blew out debris and smoke and some fire. And then we did a lighting effect on the inside and then the rest of the explosion was handled by visual effects." [...] For the scenes on the PATH train and station, location manager Jason Farrar noted that production had exclusive use of the tracks and platform during the day when ridership was low to get their shots.|$|E
500|$|Signer Judith Vaughan, a {{resident}} of Los Angeles and a nun with the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, said, [...] "We didn't commit a crime. All <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> say, 'Hey, there's a diversity of opinion among people [...] {{and we need to}} talk about freedom of conscience.' I don't see myself as defiant." [...] In January 1985, Monsignor John P. Languille sent a memo to all Los Angeles social service directors, ordering them to cease referring homeless women to the shelter Vaughan supervised [...] "because of [...] pro-abortion position". Vaughan was reportedly expelled in February 1985 but in April 1986 she spoke to the Los Angeles Times to say that the Church had closed the case without requiring her to retract her statement. With the help of her superior, Sister Miriam Therese Larkin of St. Louis, Missouri, she retained her position in the order, and Languille's memo was overturned.|$|E

500|$|Spotnitz {{called the}} episode a [...] "wonderful mind game" [...] but {{was worried that}} the {{convoluted}} story and pace would confuse the viewer. In order to placate these concerns, the teleplay was assigned to be finalized by John Shiban and Vince Gilligan. Once the script was finished, Spotnitz felt the story had become much more understandable; he was particularly pleased with the way Shiban and Gilligan showed Mulder and Scully stepping on the mushrooms {{as a way to}} subtly cue their initial exposure to the hallucinogenic mushroom. Gilligan noted that [...] "another really important thing <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> making sure that the audience didn't think that Mulder and Scully weren't really in jeopardy—that it was all a dream, like that whole season of Dallas a few years back. That's why we made sure they realized that the goo from the mushroom would kill them".|$|E
500|$|Donen is {{credited}} with transitioning Hollywood musical films from realistic backstage dramas to a more integrated art form in which the songs were a natural continuation of the story. Before Donen and Kelly made their films, musicals [...] such as the extravagant and stylized work of Busby Berkeley [...] were often set in a Broadway stage environment where the musical numbers {{were part of a}} stage show. Donen and Kelly's films created a more cinematic form and included dances that could only be achieved in the film medium. Donen stated that what he was doing was a [...] "direct continuation from the Astaire – Rogers musicals... which in turn came from René Clair and from Lubitsch... What <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> not geared towards realism but towards the unreal." [...] Film critic Jean-Pierre Coursodon has said that Donen's contribution to the evolution of the Hollywood musical [...] "outshines anybody else's, including Vincente Minnelli's." [...] He is the last surviving notable director of Hollywood's Golden Age.|$|E
500|$|Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter met in 1987 while {{attending}} the Lycée Carnot, a secondary school in Paris. The two became good friends and later recorded demo tracks with {{others from the}} school. This {{eventually led to the}} formation of a guitar-based group called Darlin' with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992. Bangalter and Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz was brought on board after the two sought an additional guitarist. The trio had branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name, which they covered along with an original composition. Stereolab released both tracks on a multi-artist Duophonic Records EP and invited the band to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom. Bangalter felt that [...] "The rock n' roll thing <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> pretty average, I think. It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was it." [...] A negative review in Melody Maker by Dave Jennings subsequently dubbed the music [...] "a [...] punky thrash." [...] Instead of dismissing the review, they found it amusing. As Homem-Christo stated, [...] "We struggled so long to find [...] Darlin', and this happened so quickly." [...] Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with Phoenix. Bangalter and Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesisers.|$|E

500|$|Khánh's {{quartet of}} delegates responded to Taylor in a circumlocutory way. They {{remained}} calm {{and did not}} resort to direct confrontation. Kỳ said the change was necessary, as [...] "the political situation is worse than it ever was under Diệm". Kỳ explained that the situation mandated {{the dissolution of the}} council, saying [...] "We know you want stability, but you cannot have stability until you have Unity." [...] He claimed some HNC members were disseminating coup rumors and creating doubt among the population, and that [...] "both military and civilian leaders regard the presence of these people in the High National Council as divisive of the Armed Forces due to their influence". Kỳ further accused some of the HNC members of being communist sympathizers and cowards who wanted to stop the military from strengthening. He promised to explain the decision at a media conference and vowed that he and his colleagues would return to purely military roles in the near future. Thiệu added [...] "I do not see how our action has hurt the Hương government...Hương now has the full support of the Army and has no worries from the High National Council, which we have eliminated."

500|$|Breaking {{was created}} in the South Bronx, New York City during the early 1970s. It is the first hip-hop dance style. At the time of its creation, it was the only hip-hop dance style because Afrika Bambaataa {{classified}} it as one of the five pillars of hip-hop culture along with MCing (rapping), DJing (turntablism), graffiti writing (bombing), and knowledge. Though African Americans created breaking, Puerto Ricans maintained its growth and development when it was considered a fad in the late 1970s. In a 2001 interview Richard [...] "Crazy Legs" [...] Colón, the president of Rock Steady Crew, commented on how Puerto Ricans contributed to breaking: [...] "I think the difference is when the brothas first started doing [...] and it was at its infancy they weren't doing acrobatic moves. That didn't come into play until more Puerto Ricans got involved in the mid 70s. We then took the dance, evolved it and kept it alive. In '79 I was getting dissed. I would go into a dance and I would get dissed by a lot of brothas who would ask 'Why y'all still doing that dance? That's played out'. By 79, there were very few African American brothas that was doing this... We always maintained the flava. It was like a changing of the guard and all <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> add more flava to something that already existed." [...] Breaking includes four foundational dances: toprock, footwork-oriented steps performed while standing up; downrock, footwork performed with both hands and feet on the floor; freezes, stylish poses done on your hands; and power moves, complex and impressive acrobatic moves. Transitions from toprock to downrock are called [...] "drops." ...|$|E

2500|$|The sequel was {{released}} in February 2012 for the same platforms (Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360), also developed by Klei Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. Shank 2 features a new multiplayer survival mode, updated combat mechanics and new weapons. Contrarily to the first game, Shank 2 lacks a cooperative story mode, instead offering a two-player survival mode. Klei Entertainment's Jamie Cheng said: [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> rip the game apart and reconstruct it {{to allow us to}} have more responsive controls and better graphics. We tore our combat system apart... and created new controls {{to be able to use}} the enemies' weapons against themselves." ...|$|E
