40|$|For a torus G of rank r = 1, <b>we</b> <b>showed</b> {{that the}} {{canonical}} ring homomorphism L_G → MU_G, where L_G is the equivariant Lazard ring and MU_G is the equivariant cobordism ring introduced by Tom Dieck, is surjective. <b>We</b> also <b>showed</b> that the completion map MU_G →M̂Û_G = MU(BG) is injective.

2500|$|Proof: <b>We</b> <b>show</b> if [...] is a Fermat prime (and hence by the above, m is a {{power of}} 2), then the {{congruence}} [...] does not hold.|$|E
2500|$|In {{some cases}} {{we need to}} {{consider}} non-negative semi-definite sesquilinear forms. This means that [...] is only required to be non-negative. <b>We</b> <b>show</b> how to treat these below.|$|E
2500|$|Now <b>we</b> <b>show,</b> how all {{irreducible}} {{representations of}} a group [...] which is the semidirect product of an abelian normal subgroup [...] and a subgroup [...] can be classified.|$|E
40|$|In {{the article}} <b>we</b> <b>showed</b> the patient, {{a woman with}} unruptured giant {{aneurysm}} of basilar artery, <b>we</b> <b>showed</b> the done examinations, and therapy dilemmas {{about what to do}} in the given case.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to sketch an area of {{problems}} for the concept of cover. <b>We</b> <b>showed</b> that in spite of some remarks in the literature the problem of covering (unambiguous and -free) cfg's with cfg's in GNF is open.

40|$|Overall, we {{identified}} {{a number of}} new proteins that participate in nonhomologous end-joining and also in telomere addition to the ends of broken chromosomes. <b>We</b> <b>showed</b> that NHEJ is severely reduced in cells expressing both yeast mating-type genes and then went on to identify the NEJ 1 gene that was under this control. <b>We</b> <b>showed</b> the epistasis relations among a set of mutations that impair telomere addition and <b>we</b> <b>showed</b> that there are in fact two pathways to repair broken chromosomes in the absence of telomerase. We characterized the DNA damage checkpoint pathway in response to a single broken chromosome and characterized especially the adaptation of cells arrested by an unrepaired DSB. We demonstrated that the DNA damage response is nuclear-limited. <b>We</b> <b>showed</b> adaptation defects for Tid 1 and Srs 2 proteins and showed that Srs 2 was also recovery-defective, even when DNA was repaired...|$|R

6000|$|... 70. I {{must begin}} a little {{apparently}} wide of the mark, {{and ask you}} to reflect {{if there is any}} way in which we waste money more in England than in building fine tombs? Our respect for the dead, when they are just dead, is something wonderful, and the way <b>we</b> <b>show</b> it more wonderful still. <b>We</b> <b>show</b> it with black feathers and black horses; <b>we</b> <b>show</b> it with black dresses and bright heraldries; <b>we</b> <b>show</b> it with costly obelisks and sculptures of sorrow, which spoil half of our most beautiful cathedrals. <b>We</b> <b>show</b> it with frightful gratings and vaults, and lids of dismal stone, {{in the midst of the}} quiet grass; and last, and not least, <b>we</b> <b>show</b> it by permitting ourselves to tell any number of lies we think amiable or credible, in the epitaph. This feeling is common to the poor as well as the rich; and we all know how many a poor family will nearly ruin themselves, to testify their respect for some member of it in his coffin, whom they never much cared for when he was out of it; and how often it happens that a poor old woman will starve herself to death, in order that she may be respectably buried.|$|E

30|$|<b>We</b> <b>showed</b> that 50 % {{enhancement}} {{in energy}} consumption and higher {{can be achieved}} if one hop is enough to reach an MT with good channel to the AP. In addition, <b>we</b> <b>showed</b> that even with multiple hops, cooperation can still achieve energy savings {{as long as the}} data rates achieved in the cooperation case is much higher than the data rate of the direct link.|$|R
30|$|In summary, <b>we</b> <b>showed</b> that VDAC 1 (outer member) and MCU (inner member) form {{complex and}} mediate {{mitochondrial}} calcium uptake and stress-induced cell death. Furthermore, <b>we</b> <b>showed</b> that MCU {{is involved in}} oxidative stress-induced apoptosis as a downstream regulator of VDAC 1. Therefore, the inhibition of the activity of MCU or disruption of VDAC 1 -MCU interaction might be a strategy to stroke and degenerative diseases.|$|R
40|$|Recently <b>we</b> <b>showed</b> that a {{homogenous}} gas of spin-polarized 6 Li atoms {{can become}} superfluid at experimentally attainable temperatures and densities. Moreover <b>we</b> <b>showed</b> that {{the lifetime of}} the gas can be sufficiently long to perform experiments. The critical temperature depends on the densities of the two hyperfine states involved. Here we present a theory for the superfluid state for arbitrary ratios of these densities...|$|R
