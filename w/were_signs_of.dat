5|$|Urban responded favourably, perhaps {{hoping to}} heal the Great Schism of forty years earlier, and to reunite the Church under papal primacy by helping the Eastern churches in their time of need. Alexios and Urban had {{previously}} been in close contact in 1089 and after, and had discussed openly {{the prospect of the}} (re)union of the Christian church. There <b>were</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> considerable co-operation between Rome and Constantinople in the years immediately before the crusade.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 study {{suggested}} that the correlation of tail length and body size in males, wing length in females, and lifespan for both sexes <b>were</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> individual quality, and the wrens of high quality tend to mate with like individuals. The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and life experience are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle. Due to the large size of male wrens and the male's vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a {{possible explanation for the}} sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of this feud, Germanicus became ill and despite the fact Piso had removed himself to the port of Seleucia, he was {{convinced}} that Piso was somehow poisoning him. Tacitus reports that there <b>were</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> black magic in Piso's house with hidden body parts and Germanicus' name inscribed on lead tablets. Germanicus sent Piso a letter formally renouncing their friendship (amicitia). Germanicus died soon after on 10 October of that year. His death aroused much speculation, with several sources blaming Piso, acting under orders from Emperor Tiberius. This was never proven, and Piso later died while facing trial. Tiberius feared the people of Rome knew of the conspiracy against Germanicus, but Tiberius' jealousy and fear of his nephew's popularity and increasing power was the true motive as understood by Tacitus.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the British Industrial Revolution, {{which saw}} a rapid {{economic}} expansion between 1750 and 1850, there <b>were</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. These ranged from industries connected to agriculture, such as milling and {{the manufacture of}} woollen textiles, through to mining and quarrying. Until the Industrial Revolution, Wales had always been reliant on its agricultural output for its wealth and employment and the earliest industrial businesses were small scale and localised in manner. The emerging industrial period commenced around the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that {{could take advantage of}} Cornwall's copper mines and the copper deposits being extracted from the then-largest copper mine in the world at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both {{the north and the south}} of the country. In the north of Wales, John Wilkinson's Ironworks at Bersham was a significant industry, while in the south, a second world centre of metallurgy was founded in Merthyr Tydfil, where the four ironworks of Dowlais, Cyfarthfa, Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. In the 1820s, south Wales alone accounted for 40% of all pig iron manufactured in Britain.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the early}} 1960s, there <b>were</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> Tachisme and Art Informel in his work. His {{paintings}} on dark ground were almost monochrome, while those {{on a light}} ground showed a rhythmical movement of a dark mass across it. This distinctive theme became his trademark style, with increasingly dynamic strokes with intense, energetic colour.|$|E

25|$|In 1997 {{doctor and}} {{forensic}} pathologist Robert Bucklin constructed a scenario {{of how a}} systematic autopsy on {{the man of the}} shroud would have been conducted.

Bucklin concluded that the image was of a real person, subject to crucifixion.|$|E

25|$|There <b>were</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> gradual {{recovery}} in February 1993 when former commentator Eric Bischoff was appointed as Executive Vice President of WCW. Bischoff, originally brought in as a secondary commentator behind Jim Ross after the AWA folded, {{was desperate to}} give WCW a new direction and impressed Turner's top brass with his non-confrontational tactics and business savvy. Ross, upset {{that a man who}} once answered to him was now his supervisor, requested and received a release from TBS executive Bill Shaw (after suggestion from Bischoff) and ended up in the rival World Wrestling Federation (WWF).|$|E
25|$|Godoy's {{frequent}} promotions <b>were</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> his increasing {{influence over}} the King and Queen. In 1791, Prime Minister Floridablanca accused Godoy of an adulterous relationship with the Queen. In January 1792, Floridablanca fell from office on account of Spain's relationship with the emerging French Republic. His successor Aranda fell from office the following November, and Queen Maria Louisa arranged for Godoy to be Prime Minister. Godoy's appointment {{seems to have been}} accomplished with the full acceptance of King Charles IV who, lacking talent for governing, was happy to employ a competent and trustworthy stand-in.|$|E
25|$|When he {{was sworn}} in, Martin's new cabinet {{retained}} {{only half the}} ministers from the Chrétien government, a noteworthy break in tradition from previous instances where a retiring prime minister handed over power to his successor as party leader.

While these <b>were</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> open party infighting, this had little impact on Martin's record popularity, with several pundits suggesting that the cabinet change was meant to present a new government different from Chrétien's ten-year tenure.|$|E
