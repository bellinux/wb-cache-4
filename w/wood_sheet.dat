Since the 1970s, they have almost entirely been replaced by plastic, commercial toys, due to children’s interest in commercial toys, especially electronic ones.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fourth floor}} {{extension}} {{on the main}} building applied a simplified reading of the Renaissance Revival style, its flat roof topped off with a large [...] "Hotel Pontresina" [...] sign. Its significantly greater height caused it to tower above the less flamboyantly restyled building beside it. The embellishment elements of the five-section front facade were mostly formed of <b>wood,</b> <b>sheet</b> metal and zinc castings, coated in stone coloured paint. The ground floor contained the reception area and the restaurant, which was open to passing trade {{as well as to}} hotel guests not wishing to spend time and money on a bit meal (so eating [...] "à la carte"). At the back of the building the ground floor also incorporated the kitchens for the restaurant and hotel. Upstairs, the more expensive guest rooms were on the first and second floors, benefitting from the large windows conferred by the remodelled facade on the buildings western (front) face, which provided views over the road towards the Roseg valley and glacier. The two corner rooms were particularly coveted, thanks to the small balconies emerging from the bevelled corner shape of the building. The more modest top floor rooms were provided for guests with less demanding requirements and for the servants accompanying some of the more affluent guests. The 1881 extension left the hotel with a capacity of around 66 beds.On the western face of the building, close to the mountainside, the grand dining room was positioned above the kitchen on the first floor. Its height encompassed both the first and second floors. Guests eating here benefitted from a multi-course menu, albeit without being able to select individually the dishes they wished to be served. Most guests dined at the long banquet style table (the [...] "Table d’hôte"). Main meals were served at fixed times - 13.00 and 19.30 - and guests were politely but firmly informed that when they arrived late they would miss out on those courses that had already been served. ("Herrschaften, die verspätet ankommen, werden mit laufender Platte servier".) For a supplementary payment of 1 Swiss franc (lunch) or 2 Swiss francs (dinner) guests could elect to be served not at the shared long table but at separately assigned small tables.|$|E

Adaptation consisted on replacing wood shaving by stuffed <b>wood</b> <b>sheet</b> and the placement of a conveyor belt for egg collection. This adaptation was evaluated in two experiments in the same shed with breeders from 25 to 35 weeks of age. In both experiments, there were 69 available modules, each one with 24 nests (manual nest) for collection of eggs from 7, 690 hens and one adapted module with 24 nests (mechanical nest) for mechanical collection of eggs from 110 hens. In experiment 1, weekly percentages of produced eggs and floor eggs were compared and in experiment 2, besides those variables, percentages of cracked eggs and dirty eggs in the nest were observed. Also in experiment 2, aiming to reduce floor eggs observed in experiment 1, wood shavings were added on the stuffed <b>wood</b> <b>sheet,</b> from lodging to the 26 th week. It was used a 2 × 11 factorial design, in which the main plot was constituted by the mechanical and manual nests and the sub-plots were composed of the eleven weeks of evaluation. The weekly percentage of produced weeks was similar for the two nest types, in both 1 and 2 experiments. Percentage of floor eggs (experiments 1 and 2), dirty eggs and cracked eggs (experiment 2) obtained with mechanical nest were worse than with manual nest. In experiment 2, placement of wood shavings in the mechanical nest did not contribute for reduction on floor egg percentage.

40|$|Design of {{fibreglass}} {{composite sheet}} pile seawalls is traditionally {{based on the}} flexural rigidity (EI) of the piling system. To compare with commonly used steel or <b>wood</b> <b>sheet</b> piling, {{there is a strong}} need to properly characterise the flexural behaviour of composite piling systems. Directed by this industrial need, the research reported herein is focused on the flexural response of a pultruded sheet pile seawall panel consisting of E-glass fibre-reinforced polyester. The analysis consists of an experimental investigation, analytical modelling, and finite element simulation to determine the flexural and shear rigidities of the seawall panel for use in computing the deflections of the piling system. A novel testing method was developed to simultaneously determine the flexural rigidity (EI) and shear rigidity (kAG) of the panel using Timoshenko's beam theory. Three- and four-point bending tests were performed on six different span lengths and the results were self-consistent from the two different tests. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|Molds, {{a subset}} of the fungi, are {{ubiquitous}} on our planet. Fungi are found in every ecological niche, and are necessary for the recycling of organic building blocks that allow plants and animals to live. Included in the group "fungi " are yeasts, molds and mildews, as well as large mushrooms, puffballs and bracket fungi that grow on dead trees. Fungi need external organic food sources and water to be able to grow. Molds Molds can grow on cloth, carpets, leather, <b>wood,</b> <b>sheet</b> rock, insulation (and on human foods) when moist conditions exist (Gravesen et al., 1999). Because molds grow in moist or wet indoor environments, it is possible for people to become exposed to molds and their products, either by direct contact on surfaces, or through the air, if mold spores, fragments, or mold products are aerosolized. Many molds reproduce by making spores, which, if they land on a moist food source, can germinate and begin producing a branching network of cells called hyphae. Molds have varying requirements for moisture, food, temperature and other environmental conditions for growth. Indoor spaces that are wet, and have organic materials that mol...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to {{optimize}} the water table to visualize shock waves and vortices in the water flow. We can divide this goal in two. The first {{goal of this}} thesis is the adaptation of the water table of Erasmushogeschool Brussel {{in order to have}} a laminar flow (and also to control the speed of the flow) to create the phenomena, when a solid body is placed on the table of boundary layer, vortices, and shock waves. The second goal is to visualize these phenomena in the best possible way. The first step was to do a theoretical study of the phenomena that we wanted to create in our table and the laminar flow. So in this thesis are explained the phenomena of boundary layer, shock waves and vortices; also a study of what a laminar flow is was made. After having obtained this theoretical background, seven experiments were made in order to get the first goal of this thesis; we had to define a design for the water table which reached the first goal of the thesis. After each experiment we got some conclusions that helped us to choose the next experiment to do and the best way to improve the water table. The experiments were made with one and with both pumps working. After having chosen the best design for our table, we studied two possible alternative designs for the water table. The first one consists in the installation of an upper plate on the test area for a better control of the speed of the flow. The second one is a completely new water table design where the entrance to the test area is adjustable and it controls the speed of the flow. The shock waves could be visualized in a better way and the boundary layer is not viewable. Four methods of visualization are studied in the final part of this thesis in order to get the second goal. These are Dye injection, air or hydrogen bubbles injection, aluminium particles (to see the boundary layer) and solid particles. The last one was experimented on our table by spreading rice grains on it. This thesis can be used as a guide for who works in the future on this table, so he can choose the best system of visualization according to his needs and budget; it is also important to write some alternative water tables for the future needs, as it has been done. The design chosen after the experiments has been installed in the table; the <b>wood</b> <b>sheet</b> with the tracks can be removed when we work with both pumps switched on.
