5|$|Teesside Energy from <b>Waste</b> <b>plant</b> (also {{known as}} Teesside WTE power station or Haverton Hill incinerator) is a {{municipal}} waste incinerator and waste-to-energy power station, which provides 29.2 megawatts (MW) of electricity for the National Grid by burning 390,000 tonnes of household and commercial waste a year. It {{is located on the}} River Tees at Haverton Hill, east of Billingham in North East England. Operated by SITA UK since its conception, the plant replaced the Portrack Incinerator and opened in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Between 1975 and 1996, the Portrack Incinerator on the River Tees burned 200,000 tonnes of Teesside's waste every year, {{generating}} 20 {{megawatts of}} electricity in doing so. In November 1996, the plant was closed down after it failed to meet emission regulations; it was then demolished in stages between 1998 and 2000. Following {{the closure of the}} Portrack plant, a new facility to burn Teesside's refuse was constructed. Teesside Energy from <b>Waste</b> <b>plant</b> was opened in May 1998 as a collaboration between SITA UK (the station's operator) and the local authorities of Stockton-on-Tees, Middlesbrough, Hartlepool and Redcar & Cleveland.|$|E
25|$|In February 1977 the Minister-President of Lower Saxony, Ernst Albrecht of the Christian Democratic Union, {{announced}} that the salt mines in Gorleben would be utilised to store radioactive waste. New protests by the local population and opponents of nuclear power broke out and approximately 20,000 people attended the first large demonstration in Gorleben on March 12, 1977. Protests about Gorleben continued for several years and, in 1979, the prime minister declared that plans for a nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>plant</b> in Gorleben were “impossible to enforce for political reasons".|$|E

25|$|The city is {{administered}} by the Kochi Corporation, headed by a mayor. For administrative purposes, the city is divided into 74 wards, from which the members of the corporation council are elected for five years. Earlier; Fort Kochi, Mattancherry and Ernakulam were the three Municipalities in Cochin area, which was later merged to form the Cochin Corporation. The Corporation has its headquarters in Ernakulam, and zonal offices at Fort Kochi, Mattancherry, Palluruthy, Edappally, Vaduthala and Vyttila. The general administration of the city is handled by the Personnel Department and the Council Standing committee Section. Other departments include that of town planning, health, engineering, revenue and accounts. The corporation is also responsible for waste disposal and sewage management. The city produces more than 600 tons of waste per day and a large portion of waste is decomposed at Brahmapuram Soild <b>Waste</b> <b>plant</b> into organic manure. The supply of potable water, sourced from the Periyar River is handled by Kerala Water Authority with support of Water works department of Kochi Corporation. Electricity is provided by the Kerala State Electricity Board.|$|E

In the study the emissions generated by incineration of the waste were considered using three differ-ent approaches. Initially the emissions from the <b>waste</b> incin-eration <b>plant</b> were assessed as part of the impact of waste management systems on the environment by using a Munici-pal Solid Waste Management System (MSWMS) assessment tool (also called: LCA-IWM assessment tool). This was fol-lowed by a comparison between the optimal waste incinera-tion process and the real situation.

500|$|Sheffield has a District Energy {{system that}} {{exploits}} the city's domestic waste, by incinerating it and converting the energy from it to electricity. It also provides hot water, which is distributed through over [...] of pipes under the city, via two networks. These networks supply heat and {{hot water for}} many buildings throughout the city. These include not only cinemas, hospitals, shops and offices, but also universities (Sheffield Hallam University and the University of Sheffield), and residential properties.

40|$|Municipal <b>waste</b> <b>plants</b> can be {{a source}} of {{biological}} contamination of the environment, depending on the method of operation and the type of collected waste. The aim of this study was the quantitative characteristics of airborne microorganisms at the Barycz municipal <b>waste</b> sorting <b>plant</b> in Cracow. Bioaerosol measurements of indoor and outdoor air of the municipal <b>waste</b> sorting <b>plant</b> were performed during the summer season using a six-stage Andersen cascade impactor. The highest concentration of bacterial and fungal aerosol was observed in the medium fraction sorting room (129. 02 × 103 cfu·m- 3 and 116. 21 × 103 cfu·m- 3, respectively). There were statistically significant differences in the concentrations of bacterial and fungal aerosol between indoor and outdoor air. The calculations showed a significant correlation between the concentration of bioaerosol and particulate matter. Based on the analysis of bioaerosol particle size distribution, {{it was found that the}} concentration of bacteria and fungi has a maximum value in the diameter range 3. 3 - 7. 0 μm.
