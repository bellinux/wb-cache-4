5|$|A {{charter of}} 799 records a wife of Coenwulf named Cynegyth; the charter is forged, but this detail is {{possibly}} accurate. Ælfthryth is more reliably established as Coenwulf's wife, again from charter evidence; she is recorded on charters dated between 804 and 817. Coenwulf's daughter, Cwoenthryth, survived him and inherited the monastery at Winchcombe which Coenwulf had established {{as part of}} the patrimony of his family. Cwoenthryth subsequently was engaged in a long dispute with Archbishop Wulfred over her rights to the monastery. Coenwulf also had a son, Cynehelm, who later became known as a saint, with a cult dating from at least the 970s. According to Alfred the Great's biographer, the Welsh monk and bishop, Asser, Alfred's wife Ealhswith was descended from Coenwulf through her mother, Eadburh, though Asser does not say <b>which</b> <b>of</b> Coenwulf's children Eadburh descends from.|$|E
5|$|After Guy and Joanna have sex, Martin arrives to {{tell them}} that Joanna is Guy's mother. She met Guy's father whilst she was an {{exchange}} student in Switzerland. Guy then stabs a syringe full of Botox into Martin's legs as an act of revenge. Martin is taken into an ambulance, and Caroline helps Joanna, but Guy punches Mac in a drunken rage and steals the ambulance. Mac tries to stop him and gets on the ambulance, which drives away. Guy drives the ambulance to Wales, with Mac and the paralysed Martin with him. Whilst Mac tries to phone the police, Guy drives into a field and almost goes over a cliff. The first series ends with Guy, Mac and Martin teetering on the edge – a literal cliffhanger – while ending up in a discussion about <b>which</b> <b>of</b> The Three Musketeers they are most like.|$|E

5|$|After the Texas Revolution ended, the {{original}} {{draft of the}} letter was given to Travis's family in Alabama. Several prominent Texians {{are known to have}} visited Travis's estranged wife shortly after the hostilities ended, but historians are unsure <b>which</b> <b>of</b> these men might have delivered the letter. Travis's daughter Susan (aged five {{at the time of his}} death) passed the letter down to her descendants; it eventually reached her great-grandson, John G. Davidson. In February 1891, Davidson lent the letter to the Texas Department of Agriculture, Insurance, Statistics, and History. Two years later, Davidson offered to sell the letter to the state of Texas for $250 ($ today). This represented half of the annual sum allocated for collecting historical manuscripts, and the state was hesitant to agree. After negotiations, Davidson agreed to accept $85 ($ today) for the letter, and on May 29 it officially passed into state ownership.|$|E
5|$|Although many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forward {{to explain how the}} ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include systemic acidosis (high levels of acid in the blood), electrolyte changes and hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose). Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known <b>which</b> <b>of</b> these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E
5|$|Although the duo {{felt that}} the presets and {{parameters}} of digital tools would inhibit creativity and innovation, they admitted that Random Access Memories {{could not have been}} made in the complete absence of computer technology. The sessions were recorded simultaneously onto Ampex reels and as Pro Tools tracks; Daft Punk and Guzauski would then listen to each recording in both analogue and digital iterations, deciding <b>which</b> <b>of</b> the two they preferred. Subsequently, the elements were edited by the duo with Pro Tools in a manner similar to how they would work with samples.|$|E

5|$|Another {{game from}} the book is Civil War, a text-based {{computer}} game that puts the player against the computer in a simulation of the American Civil War. Civil War originated on multi-user mainframe computers in 1968, and simulates fourteen major battles of the conflict, with the human player as the South and the computer as the North. The player can control four direct variables which interact to determine a battle's outcome: how much of their {{money to spend on}} food, salaries, and ammunition, and <b>which</b> <b>of</b> four offensive or four defensive strategies to use. The side with the fewest casualties wins a battle, and if the player wins eight or more battles they win the game. After appearing in 101 BASIC Computer Games, Civil War was later {{one of a number of}} text-based games available on early 1980s pay-to-play systems.|$|E
5|$|As a British {{passport}} holder born outside the United Kingdom, FIFA regulations {{at the time}} allowed him to select <b>which</b> <b>of</b> the Home Nations {{he would like to}} represent, which led to interest from the non-English Home Nations. In September 1999, he rejected a call-up from Northern Ireland in favour of joining up with Wales, managed by former Manchester United teammate Mark Hughes and coach Eric Harrison. However, he picked up an ankle injury in the lead-up to the game and missed out on the match-day squad.|$|E
