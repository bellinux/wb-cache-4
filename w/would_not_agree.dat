5|$|Eventually, at {{its peak}} in late 1944 {{there were more than}} 150 spotter {{stations}} deployed on islands and mainland territories throughout Papua, New Guinea and Dutch New Guinea. The company's headquarters moved to Nadzab in June 1944, by which time stations had been established as far as Hollandia. However, in September 1944 the Australian military decided that it <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> to American requests for the unit to serve outside the Australian area of operations and it was subsequently withdrawn after being left without a future operational role. Returning to Australia, it was disbanded in April 1945. Many of its members received awards for their actions, with the company having the distinction of being Australia's most highly decorated signals unit of World War II.|$|E
5|$|In 1185 John {{made his}} first visit to Ireland, {{accompanied}} by 300 knights and a team of administrators. Henry had tried to have John officially proclaimed King of Ireland, but Pope Lucius III <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree.</b> John's first period of rule in Ireland was not a success. Ireland had only recently been conquered by Anglo-Norman forces, and tensions were still rife between Henry II, the new settlers and the existing inhabitants. John infamously offended the local Irish rulers by making fun of their unfashionable long beards, failed to make allies amongst the Anglo-Norman settlers, began to lose ground militarily against the Irish and finally returned to England later in the year, blaming the viceroy, Hugh de Lacy, for the fiasco.|$|E
5|$|While Marguerite Louise's {{behaviour}} was tolerated by {{the previous}} Abbess of Montmartre, the new Abbess, Madame d'Harcourt, frequently complained about her to the Grand Duke and the King. In retaliation, Marguerite Louise threatened to kill the Abbess with a hatchet and a pistol, and formed a clique against her. It was {{in this context that}} Cosimo III consented, in line with her wishes, to Marguerite Louise's departure for a new convent, at Saint-Mandé on the Eastern outskirts of Paris, on the condition she go out only with the King Louis XIV's explicit permission and be attended by a chamberlain of his choice. Since she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree,</b> her pension was suspended, only to be resumed when Louis XIV compelled her to yield.|$|E

5|$|Although Democrats held a {{majority}} {{in both houses of}} the General Assembly, they were divided by factionalism, which made it difficult for Chandler to find sufficient support for his programs. Some of the factionalism came from Clements and Combs supporters who were not willing to cooperate with Chandler, their chief political enemy. Still other resistance to Chandler came from a group of more liberal lawmakers like John B. Breckinridge who simply had philosophical differences with the governor. Near the end of the 1958 legislative session, this group demanded a special session to deal with the need for more money for schools and welfare programs, but Chandler refused to call the session when the liberals <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> to pass only the measures he put before them. Because of the factionalism, Chandler had to ally with Republican legislators throughout his term in order to pass many of his proposals, including his tax plan. Frequently, this meant promising to build or repair roads in Republican districts in return for their support of his programs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) {{aspirations}} of becoming CEO of General Electric (GE) {{comes to a}} halt when his girlfriend and CNBC host, Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) informs him that the Philadelphia-based cable company Kabletown is rumored to be buying NBC. Jack—who serves as Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for GE—insists that no sale is pending, as he believes that his mentor and GE CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn) <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> to such a deal. As rumors persist, Jack panics, but things get worse when he learns from former GE chairman Jack Welch (as himself) that Don Geiss has been dead for weeks and that the company negotiated a takeover with Kabletown. Welch kept Geiss's death a secret while negotiations took place. Liz comforts Jack when he admits his dream of running GE is crushed. The next day, on Avery Jessup's program, The Hot Box, Jessup confirms that the buyout has gone forward, praising Jack Donaghy as a wise choice to lead Kabletown's new acquisition. Jack, who is watching the program, is cheered by this.|$|E
5|$|In April 1944, five USAAF personnel, {{as well as}} four {{officers}} and 20 enlisted men from the US Signal Corps, were seconded to the NGAWW to be trained as spotters {{for the purpose of}} establishing the American Air Warning Wireless Unit to function in the Philippines. The company's headquarters moved to Nadzab in June 1944, by which time stations had been established as far as Hollandia, with many behind Japanese lines. Eventually, at its peak in late 1944 there were more than 150 spotter stations deployed on islands and mainland territories throughout Papua, New Guinea and Dutch New Guinea. However, in September 1944 the Australian military decided that it <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> to American requests for the unit to serve outside the Australian area of operations and it was subsequently withdrawn after being left without a future operational role. Meanwhile, Captain John Marsh took over command from Cumpston who was posted to Washington as a liaison officer. Marsh then oversaw the closure of the remaining network and the preparation of the unit for shipping back to Australia. The spotters were subsequently concentrated at Nadzab, with many meeting each other face-to-face for the first time. The unit left New Guinea in December 1944.|$|E

25|$|Peace {{negotiations}} {{that began in}} September broke down by early October after the Burmese <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> to British terms. The British had demanded {{no less than the}} complete dismemberment of the Burmese western territories in Arakan, Assam, Manipur and the Tenasserim coast as well as two million pounds sterling of indemnity. The Burmese <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> to give up Arakan and the large sum of indemnity.|$|E

50|$|School {{district}} officials made {{an incomplete}} application for the Race to the Top federal grant {{which would have}} brought the district several million additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement. The teachers' union <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>agreed</b> to support the effort. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure {{of a majority of}} school districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.|$|R

O'Keefe said he felt CNN's early coverage had been slanted in favor of ACORN, because CNN had interviewed both ACORN staff members and defenders.|$|E

50|$|Formally, the {{declaration}} was promulgated voluntarily by the Republic of Austria.

25|$|After Lincoln {{issued the}} Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, the federal {{administration}} adopted {{a policy of}} organizing United States Colored Troops.

In 1565, Martín Cortés, Marquess del Valle, son and heir of Hernán Cortés, and Luis, another son, were the leaders of this conspiracy (the Conspiracy of 1565).|$|E
25|$|William Friedkin {{wanted to}} cast McQueen {{as the lead}} in the action/thriller film Sorcerer (1977). Sorcerer was to be filmed {{primarily}} on location in the Dominican Republic, but McQueen {{did not want to be}} separated from Ali MacGraw for the duration of the shoot. McQueen then asked Friedkin to let MacGraw act as a producer, so she could be present during principal photography. Friedkin <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> to this condition, and cast Roy Scheider instead of McQueen.

5|$|Governor-General Kerr was {{following}} the crisis closely.

Whitlam rejected the idea, seeking to end the Senate's right to deny supply. On 3 November, after a meeting with Kerr, Fraser proposed that if the government agreed to hold a House of Representatives election {{at the same time as}} the half-Senate election, the Coalition would concede supply. Whitlam rejected this offer, stating that he had no intention of advising a House election for at least a year.|$|R
