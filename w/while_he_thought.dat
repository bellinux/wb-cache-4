5|$|Sulla, who had {{observed}} the violent results of radical populare reforms (in particular those under Marius and Cinna), was naturally conservative, {{and so his}} conservatism was more reactionary than it was visionary. As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and thus the senate. After being appointed Roman Dictator in 82 BC, he enacted a series of constitutional reforms. He resigned the Dictatorship in 80 BC, retired in 79 BC, and died a year later. <b>While</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that he had firmly established aristocratic rule, his own career had illustrated the fatal weaknesses in the constitution. Ultimately, it was the army, and not the senate, which dictated {{the fortunes of the}} state.|$|E
5|$|In 88 BC, {{an aristocratic}} senator named Lucius Cornelius Sulla was elected Consul, and soon {{left for a}} war in the east. When a Tribune revoked Sulla's command of the war, Sulla brought his army back to Italy, marched on Rome, secured the city, and left for the east again. In 83 BC he {{returned}} to Rome, and captured the city a second time. In 82 BC, he made himself Dictator, and then used his status as Dictator to pass a series of constitutional reforms that were intended to strengthen the senate. In 80 BC he resigned his Dictatorship, and by 78 BC he was dead. <b>While</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that he had firmly established aristocratic rule, his own career had illustrated the fatal weakness in the constitution: that it was the army, and not the senate, which dictated the fortunes of the state. In 70 BC, the generals Pompey Magnus and Marcus Licinius Crassus were both elected Consul, and quickly dismantled Sulla's constitution. In 62 BC Pompey returned to Rome from battle in the east, and soon entered into an agreement with Julius Caesar. Caesar and Pompey, along with Crassus, established a private agreement, known as the First Triumvirate. Under the agreement, Pompey's arrangements were to be ratified, Crassus was to be promised a future Consulship, and Caesar was to be promised the Consulship in 59 BC, and then the governorship of Gaul (modern France) immediately afterwards. In 54 BC, violence began sweeping the city, and in 53 BC Crassus was killed. In January 49 BC, the senate passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, he would be considered an enemy of the republic. In response, Caesar quickly crossed the Rubicon with his veteran army, and marched towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the Consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece, and allowed Caesar to enter the city unopposed.|$|E

25|$|Ocean and Calcutta left Portsmouth on 27 April 1803 {{and reached}} Santa Cruz on the Island of Tenerife, {{part of the}} Canary Islands on 17 May 1803. Both ships sailed from Tenerife on 21 May and arrived at Rio de Janeiro in Brazil on 29 June. While in Rio, Captain Woodriff of Calcutta sent five marines under Lieutenant Sladden to help {{maintain}} order on the Ocean {{for the rest of}} the voyage. According to Reverend Robert Knopwood's journals, ‘Mr. Hartley, a settler had behaved badly’ – and it seemed there was little love lost between some of the free settlers and Captain Mertho. They apparently regarded him as a tyrant, <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> they were intractable.|$|E
500|$|In May 1808 {{the family}} moved to [...] "Woodbridge" [...] in Pittsylvania County, where {{daughter}} Eliza was born in December. Maria was then faced with rearing four children in more rural, less favorable living conditions. For his part, Tucker was disappointed with an absence of the desired social life. <b>While</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> all his neighbors [...] "friendly and civil", they were also [...] "unpolished and plain". With an increased effort in his law practice, Tucker discovered more success and acquired more clients, spread across four counties. He was also elected Commonwealth's Attorney for Pittsylvania county. Maria gave birth to daughter Lelia in October 1810 and Harriett in May 1813.|$|E
500|$|Tyndall later {{described}} his membership of these openly Neo-Nazi groups as a [...] "youthful indiscretion". He expressed {{the view that}} while he regretted his involvement in them, he was not ashamed of having done so: [...] "though some of my former beliefs were mistaken, I will never acknowledge that there was anything dishonourable about holding them." [...] As leader of the NF he continued to openly approve of Hitler's social and economic program and well as his policies of German territorial expansion. In his 1988 autobiography The Eleventh Hour, he stated that <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that [...] "many of [...] intentions were good ones {{and many of his}} achievements admirable", he did not think [...] "that it is right for a British movement belonging to an entirely different phase of history to model itself on the movement of Hitler".|$|E

500|$|In reviews {{around the}} time of the game's release, reviewers {{appreciated}} the science fiction themes of the game. Neal Chandran at RPGFan called the plot excellent, and appreciated how the game's story is a [...] "personal, character-driven, emotive, human tale based around gentle romance" [...] rather than an apocalyptic [...] "beat-the-bad-guy kind of story". He also liked how the game's interactivity is on a more personal scope than in adventure games and role-playing games he had played. He found the game's pacing and writing quality to be good, and liked the music, finding it to complement the mood of the game well. <b>While</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> the game's graphics were not [...] "anything special", he was impressed by the character designs, especially that of the character Haruka. A writer at Famitsu, however, called the game's mood boring from start to end in their review of the PlayStation version.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with a B, explaining that <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it was [...] "much more fun" [...] {{than the previous}} week's episode and enjoyed Peter's expanded presence, he was growing slightly wearied by the [...] "hint-dropping" [...] of Peter's past. Murray thought the climax was [...] "so exciting" [...] {{that he was willing}} [...] "to forgive {{the fact that this is}} the third week in a row that Walter's big idea has involved some kind of communication with the unconscious". IGN's Travis Fickett rated it 7.5/10, writing that he thought it was a solid episode because the [...] "characters are coming together nicely, the story is better than last week's – but already it seems the show is hitting a formula". Fickett expressed worriment that Fringe would eventually become too formulaic, much like the first season of Smallville, and concluded his review by calling Fringe [...] "a solid show, but [...] exceptional yet".|$|E
500|$|Several {{other critics}} praised {{the way that}} the film had kept the tone of James's story and the subtle {{approach}} to horror. This subtlety, according to a review in the Western Morning News, hit [...] "exactly the right note of terror", and the film was praised as genuinely scary by some critics. Whittaker, though generally critical of the film, felt it strongest when focussed on the house, children and ghosts. Paul Whitelaw, writing in The Scotsman, commended Welch and Fywell for sustaining a horrific atmosphere, and noted that the soundtrack added to the horror. For him, even the use of horror clichés was effective, contributing to the film's atmosphere. The Guardians Phil Hogan expressed a contrary opinion: <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> The Turn of the Screw [...] "exquisitely turned out", he felt the film's use of clichés limited {{the extent to which it}} was actually scary. In a review for The Leader-Post, Andy Cooper praised the [...] "creepy atmosphere" [...] and tension, but said that the film [...] " [...] short in the chills department" [...] and [...] "could have done with a few jolts of terror to breathe more life into it".|$|E

500|$|By early 2014, {{the lack}} of a clear {{mainstream}} Republican candidate for the 2016 presidential election led some supporters, donors, and pollsters to suggest Romney stage a third run. Regarding such a possibility, Romney at first responded, [...] "Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no." [...] Nevertheless, speculation continued: the continuing unpopularity of Obama led to buyer's remorse among some voters; the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine made Romney's [...] "No. 1 geopolitical foe" [...] remark look prescient; and an August 2014 poll of Iowan Republicans showed Romney with a large lead there over other potential 2016 candidates. A poll conducted in July 2014 by CNN showed Romney with a 53 to 44 lead over Obama in a hypothetical election [...] "redo." [...] By early 2015, Romney was actively considering the idea and contacting his network of supporters. [...] In doing so he was positioning himself in the invisible primary – the preliminary jockeying for the backing of party leaders, donors, and political operatives – against former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who had already set a likely campaign in motion and would be a rival to Romney for establishment Republican support. Despite support in some quarters for a third bid for the presidency, there was a backlash against him from conservatives who wanted a fresher face without a history of presidential losses, and many of Romney's past donors were not willing to commit to him again. Romney announced on January 30, 2015 that he would not run for president in 2016, saying that <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> he could win the nomination, [...] "one of our next generation of Republican leaders" [...] would be better positioned to win the general election.|$|E

[...] Tan quickly attacked him and defeated his fleet, and Xie fled back to Jiangling (江陵, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), the capital of Jing Province, and then fled with his brother Xie Dun (謝遯), but Xie Dun was so overweight that he could not ride a horse, and so they slowed down and were captured. [...] He was then delivered to Jiankang and executed with Xie Jiao and Xie Dun, along with all of his nephews and major associates, although many of his associates were spared.

2500|$|Herodes was controversial: an {{enormously}} rich Athenian (probably {{the richest man}} in the eastern half of the empire), he was quick to anger, and resented by his fellow-Athenians for his patronizing manner. He found oratory easy, and preferred subtle, metaphorical oratory to vigorous attack; [...] "graceful" [...] speech, to use the description of Philostratus, author of Lives of the Sophists. Atticus was an inveterate opponent of Stoicism and philosophic pretensions.

2500|$|In September 2007, in Ohio, 16-year-old Daniel Petric snuck out of {{his bedroom}} window to {{purchase}} the game Halo 3 against the orders of his father, a minister at New Life Assembly of God in Wellington, Ohio, U.S. His parents eventually banned him from the game after he spent up to 18 hours a day with it, and secured it in a lockbox in a closet where the father also kept a 9mm handgun according to prosecutors. In October 2007, Daniel used his father's key to open the lockbox and remove the gun and the game. He then entered {{the living room of}} his house and shot both of them in the head, killing his mother and wounding his father. Petric was {{sentenced to life in prison}} without parole, which was later commuted to 23 years in prison. Defense attorneys argued that Petric was influenced by video game addiction. The court dismissed these claims. The judge, James Burge, commented that <b>while</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> there was ample evidence the boy knew what he was doing, Burge thought the game had affected him like a drug, saying [...] "I firmly believe that Daniel Petric had no idea at the time he hatched this plot that if he killed his parents they would be dead forever." ...|$|E
