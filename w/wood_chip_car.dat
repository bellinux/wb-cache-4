30|$|There {{are many}} methods {{to improve the}} use of woody biomass: firewood, <b>wood</b> <b>chip,</b> and pellet for energy use, pulp, and board {{manufacture}} for material use. Among these, <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> are used in many ways such as paper, fuels, and board manufacture. Maniwa has been engaged in various efforts to promote woody biomass utilization since 2006. In particular, Maniwa <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> collection facilities (<b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> facilities) have been constructed to promote <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> industry using woody biomass resources in Maniwa in 2006 – 2009. Now, 2 <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> facilities are operated: one by Maniwa lumber business cooperative association (lumber cooperation), and the other by Forestry cooperative association (forestry cooperation). The <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> facility of lumber cooperation uses both logging residues and sawmills waste to manufacture paper chip and board chip, and logging residues for <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> for fuel are produced by Forestry cooperation. But, finished products from two facilities are collected and sold through the chip facility of lumber cooperation to {{inside and outside of}} Maniwa. Especially, <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> for fuel are used in public facilities, manufacturing factories, and general offices in the city as fuel of the boiler.|$|R
30|$|Woody biomass {{business}} is commonly characterized {{as lack of}} markets and infrastructure, uncompetitive pricing, unprofitable industries, and public unconcern {{in the viewpoint of}} economic aspects (Becker et al. [25], Sundstrom et al. [26]). However, utilization of <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> which is based on waste wood resources in local area is significantly in connection with regional economic impact. 19, 300 ton of sales volume of <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> can produce 447.7 million JPY. Moreover, <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> utilization was estimated to generate 263.3 million JPY of positive balance, as <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> sales for paper increases exports and converting Bunker A to <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> for fuel decreases imports in Maniwa. As <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> utilization promoted, it could provide a strong contributions to the regional economy and employment from forestry and related industries.|$|R

50|$|In several well wooded European {{countries}} (e.g. Austria, Finland, Germany, Sweden) <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> {{are becoming}} an alternative fuel for family homes and larger buildings {{due to the}} abundant availability of <b>wood</b> <b>chips,</b> which result in low fuel costs. The European Union is promoting <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> for energy production in the EU Forest action plan 2007-2011.

40|$|The {{moisture}} {{content of the}} charged <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> is a significant factor affecting the gasification process. The increased {{moisture content}} increases the demand on the energy consumption, which is needed to cover the heat consumption related to the water evaporation and adversely affects the wood gas quality and input fuel amount. Monitoring of the moisture content in <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> is therefore the diagnostic tools suitable to evaluate the operational parameters of the whole gasification process. Present paper describes {{the design of the}} suitable methodology to measure and estimate the <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> moisture content. The issues related to the moisture content estimation include preliminary the selection of the suitable methodology based on the assumed moisture content in the <b>wood</b> <b>chips.</b> Further factor which needs to be considered {{is the fact that the}} moisture content in <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> is time dependent due to the changing parameters of the ambient air (as temperature, pressure and air humidity). Correctly estimated moisture content will enable to improve the <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> gasification process...|$|R

40|$|Hedgerows are {{landscape}} features with ecological value and agricultural benefits which are appreciated in organic farming. Biomass from periodical cutting down of hedgerows is often unutilized litter. The study assesses different ways {{how to use}} <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> from hedgerows, and quantifies the biomass potential for either mulching arable land with <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> or, alternatively, for bioenergy use. The calculations are based on experiments at the experimental station for organic farming Kleinhohenheim and on literature. The yield of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> was clearly too low to mulch the total arable land of the model farm. Hedgerows on an area equal to 1 % of the farm area yielded <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> for 0. 05 ha if 160 m 3 ha- 1 were applied. This layer significantly reduced weeds. Hedgerows covering 5 % or 20 % of the farmland would provide <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> for about 0. 2 or 1 ha for mulching or, used as firewood, they would cover the corresponding fuel oil demand {{of more than one}} average household. Compared to poplars in short rotation coppice on the same area, the energy output is low. Since an energy use of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> is ecological and economical inefficient, mulching seems a reasonable way to use <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> from cutting hedgerow, in spite of low yields. <b>Wood</b> <b>chips</b> should be applied to thoroughly selected areas, such as slopes (protection from soil erosion), crops with wide inter-row-distance or to perennial, high-value crops...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough basic {{investigations}} on <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> {{material properties}} haven been carried out, only few studies deal with transport of <b>wood</b> <b>chips,</b> {{despite the fact}} that significant problems are commonly observed when feeding biomass in industrial applications. Within the work presented, basic bulk material properties were measured and experiments carried out with a system consisting of a hopper, agitator and a screw conveyor. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate how three different <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> grades and two blends of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> influence typical design parameters, such as mass flow and driving torque, of a biomass feeding system. The measured basic bulk properties are in good overall agreement with the literature. However, discrepancies were discovered between two standardized methods for determination of the bulk density. The results for the driving torque, mass flow and mass-related energy consumption showed that different grades of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> can alter these values considerably. Between two <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> grades, a twice as high torque was recorded, while a third grade could not be fed due to jamming. One of the major findings of this study is that mixing a rather small amount of a high-fine content grade with the non-feedable grade of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> resulted in a blend which inhibited jamming during the screw feeding process...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of bioenergy {{on the basis}} of wood fuels has received considerable attention in the last decades. The combination of large forest resources and reliance on fossil fuels makes the issue of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> usage in Russia an actual topic for the analysis. The main objective {{of this study is to}} disclose the current state and perspectives for the production of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> and their usage as a source of energy in the North-West of Russia.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Forest and Wood Science)) —University of Stellenbosch, 2005. In {{this study}} the {{mechanical}} pulping characteristics of Solanum mauritianum (Bugweed) were investigated using Thermomechanical (TMP), Chemithermomechanical (CTMP) and Biothermomechanical (BTMP) methods. Results {{were compared with}} those obtained from Pinus patula pulps treated under similar conditions. In the TMP pulping trials, the pretreatment of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> involved soaking of chips in water overnight prior to refining. The CTMP pulping trials involved first the impregnation of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> with 3 % sodium sulfite and 2 % sodium carbonate solution for 24 hours before refining. Coculture of hemicellulolytic Aspergillus flavipes and ligninolytic Pycnoporus sanguineus were inoculated to the <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> in BTMP trials, to enhance <b>wood</b> <b>chip</b> breakdown. Solanum mauritianum (Bugweed) <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> produced the highest pulp yields and less shive content compared to Pinus patula treated under similar pulping conditions. This could be ascribed to easier fibre separation and lesser fibre damage, {{as well as its}} lower extractive content. Results showed that the pretreatment of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> prior to TMP pulping increased paper strength properties compared to the pulp prepared from the untreated <b>wood</b> <b>chips.</b> Chemically pretreated <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> consumed a larger amount of refining energy. With regard to brightness levels, handsheets from Pinus patula pulps recorded lower brightness values than those from Bugweed pulps. This was related to the lighter colour of the Bugweed <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> and the higher extractive content of Pinus patula. The high brightness level of the CTMP pulps could be attributed to a modification of the lignin chromophores and the extractive removal, which contributed to a lower absorption coefficient of the pulp. Handsheets from BTMP pulps showed a reduction in brightness compared to the TMP and CTMP pulps. This was caused by the darkening of the <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> during the fungal incubation period. Pulp and paper properties of Bugweed compared favourably to those results published for other hardwoods. The {{results of this study suggest}} possibilities for using Bugweed in high yield pulping processes...|$|R

40|$|The {{published}} {{version of}} this article can be viewed at the link below. A technique for the dissection and measurement of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> used in cement bonded particleboard (CBPB) removed from the unpressed mat and the pressed board has been developed. The prepared chips were subjected to changing relative humidity (RH) conditions. The results illustrated the contribution of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> to the performance of CBPB. The trend in change of dissected chips was similar to that of CBPB but to a different degree under both a single and cyclic change in RH. However, the compression, contortion and chemical degradation of, and the inclusion of cement in, <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> within CBPB resulted in an increase in mass change but decrease in dimensional change of dissected chips which were about 0. 7, 3. 0 and 1. 3 times the change of raw <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> respectively in mass, length and thickness over period tested. The combined effects of anisotropic characteristic, distribution and orientation of <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> within CBPB brought about a significantly different ratio between length and thickness change of dissected chips to CBPB, having a ratio of about 2. 5 for length and 15 for thickness. The nature of hysteresis loop for dissected chips was also very close to that of CBPB but dissimilar to that of raw <b>wood</b> <b>chips.</b> Chips from the various stages of the production process showed very different responses to RH due to the effect of the processing parameters (pressure, curing temperature and time) on the nature of <b>wood</b> <b>chips.</b> The chips coated without any curing treatment were the most resistant to changing RH while raw <b>wood</b> <b>chips</b> had the greatest change in mass and the chips dissected from final product had the greatest change in dimensions.
