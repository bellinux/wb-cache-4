5|$|Each {{parliament}} {{lasts for}} {{a maximum of}} five years from the date of its first sitting, and once a parliament has been dissolved a general election must be held within three months. Following a general election, the President appoints as Prime Minister an MP who, in his judgment, is likely to command {{the confidence of the}} majority of the MPs. In practice, the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the political party holding the majority of the seats in Parliament. The President also appoints other Ministers from among the MPs, acting in accordance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister's advice.|$|E

MacArthur had little confidence in Brett's abilities as commander of Allied Air Forces, and in August 1942 selected Major General George C. Kenney to replace him. Kenney's application of air power in support of Blamey's troops would prove crucial.|$|E

5|$|Singapore's Prime Minister is the Head of the Government of Singapore. The President {{appoints}} as Prime Minister an MP who, in his judgment, {{is likely}} to command the confidence {{of a majority of}} the MPs. This is a power that the President exercises in his personal discretion. The President then acts in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister to appoint other Ministers from among the Members of Parliament. These Ministers, together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister, form the Cabinet. The Cabinet has the general direction and control of the Government and is collectively responsible to Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Whenever the Prime Minister is ill, {{absent from}} Singapore, or has been granted {{leave of absence}} from his duties, the {{functions}} conferred on him by the Constitution are exercisable by any other Minister authorized by the President.

However, the President may act in his own discretion if in his opinion it is impracticable to obtain the advice of the Prime Minister due to his illness or absence.|$|E
5|$|Aviation {{had been}} {{introduced}} to Greece in February 1912, when Emmanouil Argyropoulos performed a flight, with his privately owned Nieuport IV.G aircraft, around Athens. An hour later a second flight was carried on <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister of Greece, Eleftherios Venizelos as passenger. Venizelos, impressed by the potential of air warfare, suggested that Greece should take advance of this new weapon. The following months a French military mission took up the development of Greek aviation by creating a fleet of four Maurice Farman MF.7 airplanes. In June 1912, aviator Dimitrios Kamperos modified one of the Farmans into a hydroplane, giving it {{the name of the}} mythical hero Daedalus.|$|E

5|$|Charles and Zita were crowned in Budapest on 30 December 1916. Following the {{coronation}} {{there was a}} banquet, but after that the festivities ended, as the emperor and empress thought it wrong to have prolonged celebrations {{during a time of}} war. At the beginning of the reign, Charles was more often than not away from Vienna, so he had a telephone line installed from Baden (where Charles's military headquarters were located) to the Hofburg. He called Zita several times a day whenever they were separated. Zita had some influence on her husband and would discreetly attend audiences <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister or military briefings, and she had a special interest in social policy. However, military matters were the sole domain of Charles. Energetic and strong-willed, Zita accompanied her husband to the provinces and to the front, as well as occupying herself with charitable works and hospital visits to the war-wounded.|$|E
5|$|Despite Blom-Cooper's {{recommendations}} that Bird never {{be allowed to}} hold public office again and strong opposition disapproval, he was made Minister of Science, Technology and Communications in a cabinet reshuffle on 15 May 1996. He soon found himself at odds <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister; after the government announced plans to evict Thomas Bufton and his wife from Guiana Island, where they had lived for 32 years, {{in order to build}} a tourist resort, Bird began serving as the Buftons' lawyer. A dispute between Bufton and Bird led to a fight at Bird's law offices, during which he was shot in the mouth and taken to intensive care on 16 December 1997; this followed Bird speaking up for the Buftons' cause before voting in support of a motion to allow the police to evict them, using force if necessary. Bufton was later acquitted of attempted murder, but still evicted.|$|E
5|$|Having taken {{office in}} 1805, Shaw {{determined}} to re-establish the tradition whereby the Lord Mayor took precedence in public processions within the City of London over all except the reigning monarch, {{and took the}} opportunity of the funeral of Lord Nelson in 1806 to do so. According to one account, Shaw discussed the matter <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister, Lord Liverpool, who was aware that the Prince Regent would be attending the funeral, but did not seem willing to take action. Shaw then offered to visit the King himself at Windsor Castle to resolve the matter, and Liverpool {{said that he would}} see what could be done. By the following day, the Royal Warrant of Precedence had been granted, and Shaw duly led the procession.|$|E

5|$|In September 1982, Armee Nationale Sihanoukiste (ANS) {{was formed}} by the merger of several pro-FUNCINPEC {{resistance}} armies, including MOULINAKA. However, ties between FUNCINPEC with the KPNLF and Khmer Rouge remained tenuous. On the one hand, Son Sann publicly criticised Sihanouk on several occasions, while on the other hand, the Khmer Rouge army periodically attacked the ANS, prompting Sihanouk in threatening to quit as CGDK's president {{on at least two}} occasions in June 1983 and July 1985. In December 1987, Sihanouk met <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister of the PRK government, Hun Sen in France. The following year in July 1988, the first informal meeting was held in Jakarta, Indonesia between the four warring Cambodian factions consisting of FUNCINPEC, Khmer Rouge, KPNLF and the PRK government. The meetings were held with a view to end the Cambodian–Vietnamese War, and two additional meetings were later held which became known as the Jakarta Informal Meetings (JIM).|$|E
5|$|The Arch {{demolition}} {{was formally}} {{announced by the}} Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples in July 1961, but immediately drew widespread protest. Experts {{did not believe the}} £190,000 estimate and suspected foreign firms could move the Arch on rollers for substantially less. The Earl of Euston, the Earl of Rosse and John Betjeman all protested against the redevelopment. On 16 October, 75 architects and students staged a formal demonstration against the demolition inside the Great Hall, and a week later Sir Charles Wheeler led a deputation to speak <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister Harold Macmillan against the demolition. Macmillan replied that as well as the cost, there was no place large enough to put the Arch that would look in keeping with its surroundings. Demolition began on 6 November and was completed within four months.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Fleet {{conducted}} a sweep {{into the central}} North Sea on 1719 May without encountering any German vessels.

Iron Duke returned to Scapa Flow on 28 May, in time to participate in another sweep into the North Sea on 2931 May. After returning to Scapa Flow, Iron Duke immediately departed for Cromarty. The fleet conducted gunnery training in mid-June. Iron Duke, the 2nd Battle Squadron, and the 1st Cruiser Squadron conducted gunnery training at Cromarty on 2 August; after completing the drills, the ships returned to Scapa Flow. On 7 August, the ship again took Jellicoe to Cromarty for another meeting, this time <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prime</b> Minister, H. H. Asquith. Iron Duke was back in Scapa Flow by 16 August.|$|E
