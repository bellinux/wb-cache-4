Based on the FABEMD, a modified Goldstein interferogram filter is developed to further enhance the Kelvin <b>wakes.</b> Moreover, the moment invariants are introduced to evaluate the enhancement. Therefore, the Kelvin <b>wakes</b> are dramatically enhanced and the turbulent <b>wakes</b> are reserved.

40|$|A dynamic <b>wake</b> {{avoidance}} system utilizes {{aircraft and}} atmospheric parameters {{readily available in}} flight to model and predict airborne <b>wake</b> vortices in real time. A novel combination of algorithms allows for a relatively simple yet robust <b>wake</b> model to be constructed based on information extracted from a broadcast.

The system selectively adjusts dimensions of each <b>wake</b> plane to minimize spatial and temporal uncertainty, thereby ensuring that the actual <b>wake</b> is within the <b>wake</b> hazard zone. The predicted <b>wake</b> hazard zone is communicated in real time directly to a user via a realistic visual representation. In an example, the <b>wake</b> hazard zone is visualized on a 3 -D flight deck display to enable a pilot to visualize or see a neighboring aircraft {{as well as its}} <b>wake.</b> The system substantially enhances the pilot's situational awareness and allows for a further safe decrease in spacing, which could alleviate airport and airspace congestion...|$|R

40|$|A low-order panel code, VSAERO, {{was used}} to predict the {{aerodynamic}} characteristics of helicopter hub fairings. Since the simulation {{of this kind of}} bluff body by VSAERO was not documented before, the VSAERO solutions were correlated with experimental data to establish their validity. The validation process revealed that simulation of the aerodynamic environment around a hub fairing was sensitive to several modeling parameters. Some of these parameters are body and <b>wake</b> panels arrangement, streamwise and spanwise separation location, and the most prominent one-the <b>wake</b> modeling. Three <b>wake</b> models were used: regular <b>wake,</b> separated <b>wake,</b> and jet model. The regular <b>wake</b> is a <b>wake</b> with negligible thickness (thin <b>wake).</b> It is represented by a single vortex sheet. The separated <b>wake</b> and the jet model in the present application are <b>wakes</b> with finite thickness (thick <b>wake).</b> They consist of a vortex sheet enclosing a region of low-energy flow. The results obtained with the reqular <b>wake</b> were marginally acceptable for sharp-edged hub fairings. For all other cases under consideration, the jet model results correlated slightly better. The separated <b>wake,</b> which seemed to be the most appropriate model, caused the solution to diverge. While the regular <b>wake</b> was straight-forward to apply in simulations, the jet model was not. It requires the user to provide information about the doublet strength gradient on <b>wake</b> panels by guessing the efflux velocities at the <b>wake</b> shedding location. In summary, VSAERO neither predicts accurately the aerodynamic characteristics of helicopter hub fairings nor was cost effective...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{developed}} plate stator {{model with}} and without trailing edge blowing (TEB) is studied using experimental methods. <b>Wake</b> characteristics of flow over the stator in the three-dimensional <b>wake</b> regimes are studied using hot-wire anemometry (HWA) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques. First, the mean velocity profiles have been measured in the <b>wake</b> of the sta-tor using HWA. Four <b>wake</b> characteristics have been obtained through momentum thickness judgments: pure <b>wake,</b> weak <b>wake,</b> momentumless <b>wake,</b> and jet. These velocity profiles show some differences in momentum deficit for the four cases. Then, the velocity spectra of the pure <b>wake</b> and momentumless <b>wake</b> obtained through the HWA measurements showed that TEB can eliminate the shedding vortex of the stator. Characteristic length scales based on the <b>wake</b> tur-bulent intensity profiles showed that the momentumless <b>wake</b> can reduce the <b>wake</b> width and depth. PIV measurement is carried out to measure the flow field of the four <b>wakes.</b> Finally, the application of TEB approaching momentumless <b>wake</b> status is used on an industrial ventilation low-pressure axial fan to assess noise reduction. The results show that TEB can make the outlet of the stator uniform, reduce velocity fluctuation, destroy the vorticity structure downstream of the stator, and reduce interaction noise level of the stator and rotor...|$|R

30|$|The <b>wake</b> {{effect is}} an {{important}} factor in wind farm design. A higher rating of WTs gets more affected by the <b>wake.</b> In case of larger OSWFs, <b>wake</b> effect decreases the total power generation of the wind farm. <b>Wake</b> is the variation of wind speed from weaker to strengthen point behind the WT. The downstream WTs experience the <b>wake</b> effect. The <b>wake</b> effect depends on the allocation of WT in the wind farm. If the distance between the consequent WTs is less, the effect of <b>wake</b> on downstream side WT will be more. In [21], authors have calculated the power loss in OSWF considering turbulence intensity and atmospheric stability. These two parameters strongly affect the <b>wake</b> formation. <b>Wake</b> models are proposed to analyze the <b>wake</b> effects in [22]. Those are Jensen model by N.O.Jensen, Larsen model by G.C.
