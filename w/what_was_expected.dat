5|$|During {{practice}} {{before the}} game, California kicker Tyler Fredrickson practiced kicking the ball high to avoid <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to {{be a difficult}} Virginia Tech kick-blocking attack. During the regular season, Fredrickson had five kicks blocked and successfully converted just 14 of 29field goal attempts. Virginia Tech, meanwhile, blocked 102kicks in the 200games previous to the Insight Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Dave Pear, the Buccaneers' first Pro Bowl {{selection}} and most popular player, {{was traded to}} the Oakland Raiders for two draft picks. This was partly to get extra help in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to be a strong offensive draft, but also because Pear had requested that he be traded if his contract could not be renegotiated. Dave Green, the punter and kicker through the first three seasons, had to be replaced when he tore his achilles tendon stepping over a tackling dummy in training camp.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{chosen by}} chance was that commanded by Brig. Gen. James H. Ledlie, {{who failed to}} brief the men on <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> of them and was reported during the battle to be drunk well behind the lines, providing no leadership. Ledlie's men entered the huge crater instead of going around it, becoming trapped, and were subjected to heavy fire from Confederates around the rim, resulting in high casualties.|$|E

5|$|According to setup {{coordinator}} Douglas Cook, the rehearsals {{enabled them}} to reduce the setup time to under five minutes. Cook, who had worked on previous halftime shows, understood the details and guided the team. Drawings of the performances depicted <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> for each setup, with the volunteers assembling the stage in segments and moving them to the field with carts. Madonna's entrance had to be rehearsed several times for coordination. Although Cook learned during the game that the New England Patriots were scheduled to exit on the route used by volunteers carrying the stage equipment, he resolved the issue by talking with the team.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of the {{nomination}} speech, Howe and Roosevelt planned that the latter would run for Governor of New York in 1932 and President in 1936. However, Governor Smith was named the Democratic presidential candidate in 1928, and persuaded the state convention to draft Roosevelt. Howe predicted disaster, feeling that a Republican challenger was sure to beat Roosevelt in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to be nationally a Republican year. Though Howe remained Roosevelt's unofficial campaign manager, he was technically subordinate to a state campaign manager selected by Smith, as well as Smith's personal campaign manager, Belle Moskowitz, with whom Howe frequently clashed. In the fall election, Roosevelt won the governorship by a small margin, though Smith was defeated by Herbert Hoover both nationally and in New York State.|$|E
5|$|As a {{prominent}} figure in Portland he continually worked {{to raise funds}} for the library he supported. He would also rely on financial help from his associates in order to supplement his small salary as a federal judge. This allowed him to keep his personal appearance inline with <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> of prominent citizens. In contravention to his earlier stances during the Oregon Constitutional Convention, Deady later denounced violence against Chinese Americans during the 1870s and 1880s, even convening a grand jury to examine charging anti-Chinese crowds with criminal acts. These crowds were threatening violence against these minorities in an attempt to expel the immigrants from the state.|$|E

5|$|Stanton {{wished for}} {{a greater degree of}} {{scholarship}} in The Woman's Bible, but was unable to convince Bible scholars of her day to take part in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to be a controversial project. Scholars continued to avoid addressing the subject of sexism in the Bible until 1964 when Margaret Brackenbury Crook published Women and Religion, a study of the status of women in Judaism and Christianity. In her 1973 book Beyond God the Father, Mary Daly discussed The Woman's Bible, and subsequent works by Letty Russell and Phyllis Trible furthered the connection between feminism and the Bible. Today, biblical scholarship by women has come into maturity, with women posing new questions about the Bible, and challenging the very basis of biblical studies.|$|E
5|$|The Belgians and French {{remained}} {{confused about}} <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> {{of each other}} if or when, hostilities commenced. The Belgians were determined to hold the border fortifications along the Albert Canal and the Meuse, without withdrawing, until the French Army arrived to support them. Gamelin was not keen on pushing his Dyle plan that far. He was concerned that the Belgians would be driven out of their defences and would retreat to Antwerp, as in 1914. In fact, the Belgian divisions protecting the border were to withdraw and retreat southward to link up with French forces. This information was not given to Gamelin.|$|E
5|$|The German-born British {{physicist}} Arthur Schuster expanded upon Crookes' experiments {{by placing}} metal plates {{parallel to the}} cathode rays and applying an electric potential between the plates. The field deflected the rays toward the positively charged plate, providing further evidence that the rays carried negative charge. By measuring the amount of deflection for a given level of current, in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the charge-to-mass ratio of the ray components. However, this produced a value {{that was more than}} a thousand times greater than <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected,</b> so little credence was given to his calculations at the time.|$|E

5|$|Roe {{was rated}} as {{being one of}} Somerset better batsmen in their early years of {{first-class}} cricket, but his form in club cricket did not translate into good performances for the county. Between 1881 and 1882, Roe scored thirteen centuries, but none of those came in county cricket. In fact, {{it was not until}} 1884 that he made his first hundred in first-class cricket, scoring 132 against Hampshire. His work as a schoolmaster limited his availability for Somerset, and he only played three first-class matches for them in each of 1884 and 1885. After the 1885 season, Somerset were stripped of their first-class status for three reasons: they had not organised and played enough first-class fixtures during the season, their performances were not <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> from a first-class county, and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} European Championships, first-choice striker Eduardo, {{who was the}} team's top goalscorer during qualifying, {{suffered}} a compound fracture while playing for Arsenal in the Premier League. Bilić was forced to alter his final Euro 2008 squad significantly and recruited Nikola Kalinić and Nikola Pokrivač, neither of whom had yet played competitive games for the national team. The team received criticism after poor attacking performances in warm-up games against Scotland and Moldova, but at the tournament they beat Austria, Germany and Poland in the group stages to reach the quarter-finals with maximum group points {{for the first time}} in their tournament history. Niko Kovač remained team captain at <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to be his final international tournament, except in the final group fixture when Dario Šimić temporarily held the captain's armband. Croatia's campaign ended dramatically when they lost a penalty shoot-out to Turkey, with Luka Modrić, Mladen Petrić and Ivan Rakitić all missing their penalties. Croatia left the tournament with records for fewest goals conceded (2), fewest games lost (0), and earliest goal (in the fourth minute of their opening game against Austria; this was also the all-time earliest successful penalty at the European Championship Finals).|$|E
5|$|After the {{invasion}} was over, the brigade {{was supposed to}} support the operation with bridging and infrastructure support. During the planning for {{the invasion}}, the engineers of the brigade were told that reconstruction in Iraq would be conducted by Department of Defense contractors and Iraqi civilians. They were not originally prepared to conduct major reconstruction efforts. When V Corps became the commanding element for the task force to rebuild Iraq, much of the invasion force, including the 130th Engineer Brigade, was sent to do jobs {{they had not been}} originally planned for, as basic utilities and sanitation conditions in Iraq were far below <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected.</b> Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, the engineers engaged in a large number of initial reconstruction projects on basic utilities, including schools, water treatment plants, waste removal, and the nation's power grid. It was determined that the scale of these projects was much greater than what the US had expected or what had been encountered in previous contingencies. It was also decided that reconstruction was essential to the coalition since it would help win over the Iraqi people. By May 2003, the brigade had been completely repurposed. Though originally tasked with demolishing obstacles, building fortifications, and bridging operations, the brigade was tasked entirely with construction projects. This conversion was a difficult process, as the brigade did not have the equipment and specialist units designed to handle reconstruction on a national scale. As more US military reconstruction units arrived in Iraq, the brigade grew to eight battalions and three groups.|$|E

5|$|During the war Hirst, {{along with}} Rhodes and their team-mate Schofield Haigh, {{worked in a}} munitions factory in Huddersfield. Hirst and Rhodes were paid by Yorkshire to play in war-time cricket matches on {{a certain number of}} Saturdays. Hirst played in the Bradford League, and became known among cricketers for {{accepting}} minimal fees from financially struggling clubs. When first-class cricket restarted in 1919, Hirst resumed playing for Yorkshire. In the first match of the season he hit an aggressive unbeaten 180 against MCC, to secure a draw for the county; he followed this with two more centuries in {{the first two weeks of}} the season. Although his form later faltered, he played some substantial innings in difficult circumstances and ended the season with 1,441 runs at an average of 38.94. He bowled infrequently, taking 18 wickets at 29.27. During this season, Hirst accepted the position of coach at Eton College. In the last match of the season, at Scarborough, he was given a warm reception by the crowd, who did not expect to see him playing for Yorkshire again. However, he appeared on occasions during the school holidays in the next two seasons, although he did not score any centuries, did not average more than 24 with the bat and took only 21 wickets in total. At the end of the 1921 season Hirst retired as a Yorkshire player, and made <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to be his final first-class appearance in a Scarborough Festival match, in which he captained the Players against the Gentlemen. On the last day of the match, Hirst's 50th birthday, he took the final two wickets to secure victory for his side. The crowd gathered outside the pavilion and demanded to see him; he gave a farewell speech, and was moved by the reception given to him.|$|E

As an unmarried woman, Hale did <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> of her and devoted herself to the need of her parents.
