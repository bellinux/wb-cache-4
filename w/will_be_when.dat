If rates rise, the cost will be higher; if rates go down, cost will be lower. In effect, the borrower has agreed to take the interest rate risk.|$|E
25|$|Seam bowling is the act {{of using}} the seam of the ball to cause the ball to bounce in an {{unpredictable}} fashion when it hits the pitch. A good batsman {{will be able to}} predict where a ball is going to bounce and from that work out what height the ball <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> it reaches him or her. By generating variations in bounce, the bowler can make it more likely the batsman will make a mistake in his assessment of the ball and give away their wicket.|$|E

25|$|A {{solar oven}} is turned towards {{the sun and}} left until the food is cooked. Unlike cooking on a stove or over a fire, which may require {{more than an hour}} of {{constant}} supervision, food in a solar oven is generally not stirred or turned over, both because it is unnecessary and because opening the solar oven allows the trapped heat to escape and thereby slows the cooking process. If wanted, the solar oven may be checked every one to two hours, to turn the oven to face the sun more precisely and to ensure that shadows from nearby buildings or plants have not blocked the sunlight. If the food is to be left untended for many hours during the day, then the solar oven is often turned to face the point where the sun <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> it is highest in the sky, instead of towards its current position.|$|E
25|$|At the {{railroad}} tracks, Chanie {{turns in the}} direction away from the school and toward where he thinks his home <b>will</b> <b>be.</b> <b>When</b> it is dark, he decides to sleep next to a beaver pond, lighting a small fire with the matches {{given to him by}} the girl. However, the fire gives him little to no protection against the extremely cold temperatures that night. He ends up dreaming about the sexual abuse he experienced at the hands of one of his teachers. Back on the tracks, Chanie continues to slowly make his way on his journey, weakened from exhaustion and exposure. He falls a number of times before finally succumbing to the cold. After his death, a mother lynx lifts Chanie’s spirit and carries him into the forest, away from the tracks. In the morning an engineer comes across Chanie's frozen body by the tracks and notifies the authorities. The story ends with Chanie, warm and happy, dancing in the forest with all of the animals featured throughout the novel.|$|E
500|$|A crucial {{maneuver}} in Crash Team Racing is {{the power}} slide; the player executes the slide by holding {{down one of the}} shoulder buttons to perform a hop, and steering before the kart lands. While sliding, the [...] "Turbo Boost Meter" [...] on the lower-right corner of the screen fills up and goes from green to red. At the same time, the exhaust gas from the player's kart turns black. To get a speed boost, the player quickly presses the opposite shoulder button while the Turbo Boost Meter is red. The player can execute three speed boosts in a row during a power slide, with the third speed boost being more powerful than the previous two. If the player waits too long into the power slide for a boost, the kart back-fires and the chance for a speed boost is lost; power sliding for too long causes a spin-out. Aside from power slides, speed boosts can be obtained by gathering [...] when leaping over gaps in the track. The longer the player is in the air, the bigger the speed boost <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> the kart lands.|$|E

500|$|Steven Spielberg's 2012 film Lincoln, {{in which}} Stevens was portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones, brought new public {{interest}} in Stevens. Jones's character is portrayed as the central figure among the radicals, responsible in large part for {{the passage of the}} Thirteenth Amendment. [...] Historian Matthew Pinsker notes that Stevens is referred to only four times in [...] Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team of Rivals on which screenwriter Tony Kushner based the film's screenplay; other radicals were folded into the character. [...] Stevens is depicted as unable to moderate his views for the sake of gaining passage of the amendment until after he is urged to do so by the ever-compromising Lincoln. According to Aaron Bady in his article about the film and how it portrays the radicals, [...] "he's the uncle everyone is embarrassed of, even if they love him too much to say so. He's not a leader, he's a liability, one whose shining heroic moment <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> he keeps silent about what he really believes." [...] The film depicts a Stevens–Smith sexual relationship; Pinsker comments that [...] "it may well have been true that they were lovers, but by injecting this issue into the movie, the filmmakers risk leaving the impression for some viewers that the 'secret' reason for Stevens's egalitarianism was his desire to legitimize his romance across racial lines." ...|$|E

Negative predictive value <b>will</b> <b>be</b> negative <b>when</b> the disease <b>is</b> not present.

2500|$|The {{psychological}} connectedness objection {{claims that}} a being can be seriously harmed by being deprived of a valuable future {{only if there}} are sufficient psychological connections—sufficient correlations or continuations of memory, belief, desire and the like—between the being {{as it is now}} and the being as it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> it lives out the valuable future. As there are few psychological connections between the embryo and its later self, it is concluded that depriving it of its future does not seriously harm it (and hence is not seriously wrong). [...] A defence of this objection is likely to rest, as with certain views of personal identity, on thought experiments involving brain or cerebrum swaps; and this may render it implausible to some readers.|$|E

In his doctrine of future reward and punishment, paradise will receive those who have performed the will of God, while the nether world becomes the habitation of the wicked. (Babylonian Talmud Eruvin 19a). [...] In [...] he found Biblical authority for {{the resurrection of the}} dead (Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 91b), and in Genesis Rabbah 26 he expressed the liberal view that immortality is the portion not only of Israel, but of all other nations as well. In a legend, Joshua inquired of the Messiah when he was coming, and Elijah answered that it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> Israel heeds God's voice (...) (Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 98a.)
