He said, however, that the climate change chapter is only 50 pages long, and recommends several other books for readers <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a broader picture of this aspect: Jim Hoggan’s Climate Cover-Up, George Monbiot’s Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning and Ross Gelbspan’s The Heat is On and Boiling Point. England also said that there is little coverage about the millions of dollars which Exxon Mobil has put into funding groups actively involved in promoting climate change denial and doubt.|$|E

500|$|Baconnaise {{has been}} {{featured}} on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart several {{times as a}} repeat joke. In 2009, Jon Stewart used it in a skit that drew negative attention from Seattle Post-Intelligencers Leslie Kelly. Stewart commented, [...] "Baconnaise, for people <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> heart disease but, you know, too lazy to actually make bacon." [...] In 2010, Jon Stewart again lampooned Baconnaise with a fake clip of the billboard in Times Square that drew a response from J's Foods. According to J's Foods, a plan to run an actual billboard ad was made, but it was declined by Comedy Central. Using it as a prop in a later episode, Stewart referred to Baconnaise as [...] "capitalism's greatest triumph".|$|E
500|$|In Super Street Fighter IV, the {{developers}} attempted to retain Ibuki's playstyle and feel from Street Fighter III. She was also given a super jump (the only character, other than C. Viper, {{to have one}} in this game) and made adjustments to have combos that utilize it. Capcom's Taketoshi Sano said that [...] "Ibuki is suited to those <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{the most out of}} a single character" [...] and [...] "beginners can use her too, but if I had to pick I'd say she's suited for intermediate." [...] Capcom Europe described Ibuki’s [...] "Raida" [...] ("Thunder Strike") command grab as having some unique properties and being {{one of the most powerful}} moves in the game. According to an MTV guide, Ibuki is [...] "one of the hardest characters to master in this latest iteration" [...] and players need to gain [...] "a strong understanding of each character's moves and abilities before truly coming to grips with what the weak, yet versatile Ibuki has to offer." ...|$|E
500|$|On 29 March 1928, when a bill {{came before}} {{parliament}} giving {{the vote in}} parliamentary elections to all men and women over 21, she termed the measure [...] "a tremendous social advance", and added: [...] "At last [...] are established on that equitable footing because we are human beings and part of society as a whole... once and for all, we shall destroy the artificial barrier {{in the way of}} any women <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> education in politics and who want to come forward and take their full share in the political life of their day". When the bill became law, 4 million voters, most of them women, were added to the register. In the 1929 general election, held on 30 May, Bondfield easily held her Wallsend seat despite the intervention of a candidate representing unemployed workers. The overall election result left Labour as the largest party with 287 seats, but without an overall majority, and MacDonald formed his second minority administration.|$|E

500|$|Falle took a {{sustained}} interest in Bedford v. Canada, {{a case that}} began in the fall of 2010 when laws against keeping a brothel, communicating in order to facilitate prostitution, and living off the avails of prostitution were struck down by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice as unconstitutional. When Falle first heard about this decision, she cried, and expressed surprise and disappointment. She said that she did not believe that the average Canadian realized the implications of striking down these laws, which she said were that [...] "your next door neighbours can run a brothel right beside you. Your children could be exposed to condoms left on their driveway, johns propositioning them." [...] She also expressed her concern that striking down anti-prostitution laws normalizes prostitution as a career option for children to consider. She also said that, without the laws, [...] "pimps will be legitimate businesspeople [...] billboards advertising brothels could start appearing on roadsides." [...] Ron Marzel, a lawyer attempting to have the anti-prostitution laws declared unconstitutional, said, [...] "the reality is there are consenting adults who want to go into" [...] prostitution. Falle was angered by this statement, and replied that 97% of women in the sex industry are not engaging in prostitution by choice, and that [...] "the voices of the overwhelming majority of women <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of prostitution are being drowned out by a vocal few." ...|$|E

Despite having never smoked cannabis himself, Corbyn said in the 2015 Labour leadership election [...] "we should be adult and grown up and decriminalise cannabis". Later, in the 2016 Labour leadership election, Corbyn called for the decriminalisation of cannabis for medicinal purposes, but said that he wouldn't support legalising recreational drugs. He said about them that he wanted people to be [...] "educated away from" [...] taking drugs, and further stated that he [...] "would also {{want to look at}} supporting people <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the drugs trade {{in other parts of the}} world because there is the horrors of the drugs war that's going on in Central America".|$|E
2500|$|According to David Miller, Martin Luther viewed Mammon (or {{the desire}} for wealth) as [...] "the most common idol on earth". [...] Miller cites Jesus' {{encounter}} with the rich ruler [...] {{as an example of}} wealth being an obstacle to faith. [...] According to Miller, it is not the rich man's wealth per se that is the obstacle but rather the man's reluctance to give up that wealth in order to follow Jesus. [...] Miller cites Paul's observation in 1st Timothy that, “people <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction." [...] [...] Paul continues on with the observation that [...] "the love of money is the root of all evil." ...|$|E
