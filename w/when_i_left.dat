500|$|Tom Outridge Sr, {{winner of}} the inaugural Sandover Medal, {{said that one of}} his {{outstanding}} memories was of Harold Oliver, stating that {{when he was a boy}} he was [...] "taken by his father to see Port play at Kalgoorlie in 1913; The memory of Oliver's brilliant game is as vivid in my mind today as it was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> the ground that day. He was a wonderful player." ...|$|E
500|$|Pound {{arrived in}} Naples in July 1958, {{where he was}} photographed giving a fascist salute to the waiting press. When asked {{when he had been}} {{released}} from the mental hospital, he replied: [...] "I never was. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> the hospital I was still in America, and all America is an insane asylum." [...] He and Dorothy went to live with Mary at Castle Brunnenburg, near Merano in the Province of South Tyrol, where he met his grandson, Walter, and his granddaughter, Patrizia, for the first time, then returned to Rapallo, where Olga Rudge was waiting to join them.|$|E
500|$|Daniels is {{openly gay}} {{and lives in}} south London. He once remarked: [...] "Out? I've never been in." [...] He lives with actor Ian Gelder. They began seeing each other during a 1993 {{production}} of Joe Orton's Entertaining Mr Sloane. Daniels was already sure of his sexuality in his teens, {{although he did not}} discuss the matter with his parents because they did not have a very close emotional relationship. He was [...] "cautious about mentioning it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> drama school, because AIDS was terrifying everyone and there was a huge homophobic backlash". He decided to come out at the age of 24, while appearing in an all-star benefit performance of Martin Sherman's Bent.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} Monsters, Inc. was {{conceived}} in a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft during {{the production of}} Toy Story. One of the ideas {{that came out of}} the brainstorming session was a film about monsters. [...] "When we were making Toy Story", Docter said, [...] "everybody came up to me and said 'Hey, I totally believed that my toys came to life <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> the room.' So when Disney asked us to do some more films, I wanted to tap into a childlike notion that was similar to that. I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid. So I said, 'Hey, let's do a film about monsters.|$|E
500|$|Jyoti Singh {{was born}} and raised in Delhi while her parents were from a small village in the Ballia {{district}} of Uttar Pradesh. Her father sold his ancestral land to educate her, and worked double shifts to continue to pay for her schooling. In an interview he related that as a youth he had dreamed of becoming a school teacher, but at that time education was not considered important and girls were not even sent to school. [...] "Attitudes are changing back home now, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> 30 years ago, I vowed never deny my children so sending them to school was fulfilling my desire for knowledge." [...] He said that he put his daughter's education above that of even his two sons. [...] "It never entered our hearts to ever discriminate. How could I be happy if my son is happy and my daughter isn't? And it was impossible to refuse a little girl who loved going to school." ...|$|E
500|$|Walsh {{was passed}} over {{in favor of}} Bill [...] "Tiger" [...] Johnson for the head {{coaching}} job when Brown retired. In a 2006 interview, Walsh said Brown worked against his candidacy to be a head coach anywhere in the league. [...] "All the way through I had opportunities, and I never knew about them", Walsh said. [...] "And then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> him, he called whoever he thought was necessary to keep {{me out of the}} NFL." [...] Brown stayed on as team president following his retirement, and the Bengals later made two trips to the Super Bowl, losing both games to Walsh and the 49ers. He rarely appeared in public, however. He died on August 5, 1991 at home of complications from pneumonia. He and Katie had three sons: Robin, Mike and Pete. Following Katie's death {{of a heart attack in}} 1969, he married his former secretary Mary Rightsell in 1973. His son Robin died of cancer in 1978. Brown is buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Massillon.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after, Byrom joined Northern Premier League First Division side Clitheroe on a {{short-term}} contract. He finished the 2006–07 season top scorer with 11 league goals despite only joining {{the club in}} January 2007, including a hat-trick against Kidsgrove Athletic. However, Byrom's Clitheroe contract expired and Conference North side Southport took him on non-contract terms {{for the start of}} the 2007–08 season, where he scored two goals in two games. Despite being offered a contract by Southport manager Peter Davenport, Byrom opted to re-join Clitheroe in August 2007. On signing a two-year deal with Clitheroe, Byrom said [...] "I thought about giving up football <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> Accrington, but I really enjoyed my time at Clitheroe, they've given me a new lease of life and a licence to do what I want on the park". Clitheroe chairman, Carl Garner, said [...] "this is a big day for Clitheroe. This is one of the biggest signings the club has made. He's a special player and a special talent". In the first half of the 2007–08 season, Byrom scored six goals in all competitions for Clitheroe, which caught the attention of Conference National team Northwich Victoria. He played his last game for the Northern Premier League club in a 3–3 draw with local rivals Rossendale United, a game in which he captained the side for the first time.|$|E
500|$|Dwight Taylor was the {{principal}} screenwriter in this, the first screenplay written specially for Astaire and Rogers. Astaire reacted negatively to the first drafts, complaining that [...] "it is patterned too closely after The Gay Divorcee", and [...] "I am cast as ... a sort of objectionable young man without charm or sympathy or humour". [...] Allan Scott, for whom this movie served as his first major project, and who {{would go on to}} serve on six of the Astaire-Rogers pictures, was hired by Sandrich to do the rewrites and never actually worked with Taylor, with Sandrich acting as script editor and advisor throughout. The Hays Office insisted on only minor changes, including probably the most quoted line of dialogue from the film: Beddini's motto: [...] "For the women the kiss, for the men the sword" [...] which originally ran: [...] "For the men the sword, for the women the whip." [...] Of his role in the creation of Top Hat, Taylor recalled that with Sandrich and Berlin he shared [...] "a kind of childlike excitement. The whole style of the picture {{can be summed up in}} the word inconsequentiality. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> RKO a year later, Mark said to me, 'You will never again see so much of yourself on the screen.'" [...] On the film's release, the script was panned by many critics, who alleged it was merely a rewrite of The Gay Divorcee.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Brown {{decided to}} quit EastEnders after {{becoming}} [...] "discontented" [...] {{with the way}} Dot was portrayed. In 1997 she revealed to the Daily Mirror: [...] "I always felt Dot {{was one of those}} characters who should stay the same. She's a simple creature. There are some people who the same things happen to them again and again. They never learn [...] <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>left,</b> there was all that rubbish about it getting too much for me [...] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'. It wasn't being written properly. Instead of finding the gossip and passing it on, [...] [...] was living on a reputation. [...] said to me, 'I loved it when [...] had [...] varicose veins.' I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. I was getting so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some good stories coming up." [...] Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she [...] "didn’t like what they were doing with Dot– she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing I know, people are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‘No, this just won’t do’. I was very annoyed, I felt like they had completely changed my character." [...] The character departed on-screen in August 1993, when Dot moved away from the soap's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend, Kent.|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} a girl (a young Underwood) {{studying}} at home. Her abusive father arrives and asks her if she needs help. She declines his offer and starts gathering her things to leave the room, however; as she stands up, he grabs her arm. She manages to pull away and leave. Underwood stated that this scene had no script. She and the actor acted it out the way they thought it might have happened. Underwood revealed that she left the filming location with bruises on her arm- [...] "I had finger marks on my arm <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> {{at the end of}} the day, so I was like, 'Wow.' ... It was intense. I wasn't just imagining it, it was really intense." [...] As the video continues, the girl is seen standing in the middle of a cemetery, walking around and staring at the clouds as a thunderstorm forms in the sky. She runs back to her house through an old, destroyed yellow-brick road, similar to the one of Wizard of Oz. She enters the house to see her father sleeping on the couch, holding a bottle of alcohol. She sits next to him, recalling the times he let his drunkenness and anger get out of hand. She tries to wake him up but fails. She realizes that he has passed out. She looks through the window and notices the thunderstorm getting worse, so she leaves her father and runs to the cellar alone to protect herself. She's seen lying in an old bed and crying, as she hears the tornado coming closer, with her father still passed out. The next day, there are no traces of the house, and she calmly walks away.|$|E

The services of fraternity supplemented those of my family, my church and my teachers.

2500|$|The sailor murders ended {{only after}} the Akiska ran aground and sank near Atlantic City, his last two {{potential}} victims escaping to parts unknown. Panzram then caught a ship to Africa and landed in Luanda, Portuguese Angola. [...] He later claimed that while there, he raped and killed an 11- or 12-year-old boy. In his confession to this murder, he wrote: [...] "His brains {{were coming out of}} his ears <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> him and he will never be any deader." [...] He also claimed that he hired a boat with six rowers, shot the rowers with a German Luger pistol, and threw their bodies to the crocodiles.|$|E

2500|$|The wicked son, who asks, [...] "What is {{this service}} to you?", is {{characterized}} by the Haggadah as isolating himself from the Jewish people, standing by objectively and watching their behavior rather than participating. Therefore, he is rebuked by the explanation that [...] "It is because God acted for my sake <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> Egypt." [...] (This implies that the Seder is not for the wicked son because the wicked son would not have deserved to be freed from Egyptian slavery.) Where the four sons are illustrated in the Haggadah, this son has frequently been depicted as carrying weapons or wearing stylish contemporary fashions.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2000 {{interview}} with the Sunday Mirror Taylforth commented further on her decision to leave the serial: [...] "I left EastEnders because after 13 years I felt I really needed a break.

I love them so dearly. I still keep in touch with some of them, and my line <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left</b> the show was, 'I won't say goodbye, just au revoir', and that is how I feel. It is nice that they have left the door open for Kathy to return." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oberman {{described}} her time on EastEnders as [...] "hectic", leading her to depart the show during December 2005. However, {{the role of}} Chrissie has remained a defining point of her career. In a recent interview, Oberman remarked: [...] "Chrissie was such a wonderful character and the show was watched by so many people, especially the murder of Den, that it opened up doors that I never thought it would. I had some fantastic offers <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>left,</b> there was film and theatre... it was wonderful for me; EastEnders {{is a very good}} calling card." [...] Oberman has also recently declared her willingness to return to the part of Chrissie and EastEnders, even if only to provide a resolution for the character.|$|E
