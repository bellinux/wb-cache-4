Prudent users allow for a large safety margin in the strength of rope chosen for a task due to the weakening effects of knots, aging, damage, shock loading, etc. The <b>working</b> <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> of a rope is generally specified with a significant safety factor, up to 15:1 for critical applications.

This load represents a force that is much less than that required to make the lifting equipment fail or yield, {{also known as the}} Minimum Breaking Load (MBL). SWL or WLL are calculated by dividing MBL by a safety factor (SF). An example of this would be a chain that has a MBL of 2000 lbf (8.89 kN) would have a SWL or WLL of 400 lbf (1.78 kN) if a safety factor of 5 (5:1, 5 to 1, or 1/5) is used.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{places in}} North America, length is {{commonly}} 48 feet or 53 feet, and width is either 96 or 102 inches (including rub rails and stake pockets on the sides, which generally placed every 2 feet). Some older trailers still in service are only 45 feet or shorter if used in sets of doubles or triples (often used to haul hay). Various lengths and combination setups {{can only be}} legally driven on turnpike/toll roads which are far too long for most roadways. Body and frame {{can be one of}} 3 general designs: the heaviest and sturdiest is all steel (usually with wood planks), Ever popular combo with steel frame and aluminium bed, these type often have wood portions for nailing down dunnage boards), and aluminium (which is the lightest allowing for more cargo to be legally carried without overweight permits). Incredibly light and very expensive to purchase, all aluminium trailers are very slippery when wet, flex more and are easily damaged. They also have a natural upwards bend so that when loaded they straighten out to be more flat, rather than to sag in the middle under a load. Another popular type of flatbed trailer is a stepdeck (or drop deck) with approximately 2 feet lower deck and low profile wheels to accommodate taller loads, without hitting low bridges or tunnels. These stepdecks can come with loading ramps to allow vehicles to roll on and off of the back from ground level. Shorter trailers used for local jobs such as landscaping and building material delivery within urban or local areas can have a [...] "hitchhiker" [...] type forklift truck attached to the back in order for driver alone to deliver and unload pallet/skid items. A bulkhead or [...] "headache rack" [...] is sometimes be attached to the front of either a straight or a stepdeck trailer for load securement {{at the front of the}} deck. In the event of long pipes or steel or lumber coming loose in a hard braking incident, they save the operator and cab/sleeper in one of two manners in theory. If attached to the trailer they bend while attempting to block forward motion of a loosened cargo, causing the long load to go above the cab and driver. If attached to the frame behind the cab or sleeper of the tractor, in theory they protect the back of the cab from impact and if unable to stop the load coming thru the cab, they cause the cab to be knocked off of.the frame, rather than impale the cab and kill or seriously injure the driver.48 and 53 ft lengths usually have two axles spread out to over 10 ft apart at the rear [...] "California spread" [...] in order to allow for more weight distribution on the rear of the deck (40,000 lb instead of 34,000 for a tandem axles design). So-called Cali spread was originally designed to comply with bridge weight formulas in that state but has since been adopted in most other parts of the country. These spread axles take far wider turning radius, and if turning the combination tractor/trailer too sharply, the front axle tires of the trailer may damage the road/parking lot surface, or pop a tire bead off of the rim, or both. Some trailers have the capability of lifting or lowering the front axle independently to mitigate this risk, however driver may not be able to use this feature if the trailer is loaded, but if the deck is empty the driver can lower the front axle to bring the rear axle off of the ground to significantly decrease turning radius of the rig for easy manoeuvre in tight spaces, or to reduce tire wear during empty /deadhead miles of travel. Under the deck of the trailer can be attached racks for spare tires, dunnage boards, or tire chains...as well as various tool/storage boxes. On one side (or often both sides for alternating pull on strap tension) are usually sliding (but sometimes fixed) winches to ratchet down 4 inch straps for load securement. On most 48 foot trailers, you may not place these strap/winches over a tire as when air pressure releases out of the suspension system when parked, the deck lowers down and will likely pop a trailer tire. Some trailers have an air scale which when the driver learns how to interpret properly through experience, combined with his knowledge of how much his/her rig weighs when empty and can interpret how much cargo can safely and legally be loaded onto the trailer. With different varying loads of cargo, driver can have an idea how much his gross total weight is (and if he is legal to avoid ticket) (80,000 without a permit in most states, but slightly lower in others). Some decks have pop up chain systems which have a higher WLL (<b>working</b> <b>load</b> <b>limit)</b> than attaching chains to either the stake pocket/spools, or the frame. Other decks of trailers can have sliding detachable accessories which greatly diversify your options of where and how to place a chain hook for securement. Besides axles which raise/lower as needed, some spread axle trailers can slide one or both axles forward, or back to create a tandem setup in specific situations when necessary, to comply with weight distribution requirements. Although certain amounts of front and rear cargo overhang is allowed (as well as overhang to one or both sides of the trailer) with flags/banners/flashing lights to warn drivers behind and to the side of you of impending danger of impalement if they follow too close behind you and you should have to suddenly stop...in extreme cases permit loads require escort be led front rear or both for oversize/over dimension cargo/equipment.|$|E

40|$|The Hippocampus (HP) is an {{anatomic}} {{region of}} the medial temporal lobe involved in long-term spatial memory, which allows for orientation in a new environment using a cognitive map based on external spatial references. Otherwise, {{it is believed that}} the hippocampus has limited role in working memory (WM) which is the capacity to temporarily remember a limited amount of information. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggested that WM is affected in patients and monkeys with HP damage in conditions of high memory <b>load.</b> The <b>working</b> memory <b>load</b> is the number of elements maintained in memory for a short time interval. In humans the <b>working</b> memory <b>load</b> is <b>limited</b> to holding seven, plus or minus two digits, of information for a short-retention time interval. This limit is called working memory capacity (WMC). On the contrary, behavioral studies in rodents are still very controversial. First experiments reported that the dorsal HP is involved in spatial learning and memory, whereas the ventral HP mediates non spatial learning but later studies demonstrated that both dorsal and ventral HP are involved in the acquisition of spatial long-term memory in the Morris Water Maze task. The focus of this work is to study the role of the HP in spatial <b>working</b> memory <b>load</b> capacity in CD 1 mice, through a brain lesion study. Since anatomic and connection studies suggested that the HP is not a completely homogenous structure along its septotemporal axis, we performed selective dorsal and the ventral HP lesions. Lesioned animals and sham-operated animals have been tested in a working memory capacity version of the 8 -arm radial arm maze task, where we modulated the memory load by changing the number of open-baited arms. The results suggest that excitotoxic lesions in both hippocampal subregions cause spatial working memory capacity deficits during the first days of training. Nevertheless, lesioned animals eventually reach the performance of control animals during the last training days of training. This recovery of the performance was concomitant to the development of egocentric strategies, which are known to be HP-independent [...] This data provide the first experimental evidence on a specific contribution of the HP in spatial <b>working</b> memory <b>load</b> capacity...|$|R

Finite element {{analysis}} is undertaken {{to identify the}} extent of loading deformation of instrumented indentation equipment frame which is a main part in High-precision instrumented indentation tester developed and realized by our group. The <b>working</b> <b>load</b> enacted in the model is varied from 10 N to 100 N, and the increment load is 10 N. By plotting and fitting data of inclination angle and <b>working</b> <b>load,</b> the relationship between frame inclination angle and <b>working</b> <b>load</b> is established.

40|$|The {{reliable}} prediction {{settlement of}} pile foundation at typical <b>working</b> <b>load</b> {{remains one of}} the major geotechnical engineering problems. In this research, settlement behaviour of a pile foundation located in sandy-silt, under the loads from high-rised building is simulated in 2 D using a finite element program (PLAXIS). Three different types of analysis were investigated: a linear elastic (LE) analysis where the soil was assumed as linear-elastic material, a simple nonlinear analysis where the soil was completely assumed as Mohr- coulomb (MC) model and an advanced nonlinear analysis where the soil was completely assumed as Hardening-Soil (HS) model. A comparison was done between the predicted settlement from Finite element analysis and field settlement values. Based on the results of analysis, it is suggested that although complete MC model shows good agreement with the settlement behaviour obtained from field static load test at lower <b>working</b> <b>loads,</b> MC model is not adequate to capture the settlement prediction at higher <b>working</b> <b>loads.</b> In addition, modelling the soil completely using HS model is required to capture the safe settlement prediction at higher <b>working</b> <b>loads.</b> Finally, this scenario can be applied for the similar problems in settlement prediction using numerical methods...|$|R

40|$|The Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine offers diesel-like {{efficiency}} {{with very}} low soot and NOx emissions. In a HCCI engine, a premixed charge of air, fuel and burned gas is compressed to achieve autoigntion. Combustion occurs throughout the chamber volume resulting in short overall burn duration. This short burn duration can cause excessively high pressure rise rates {{which lead to}} unacceptable engine noise and potentially reduced engine life. To combat this high pressure rise rate the engine must be operating with significant diluent, either excess air or burned exhaust gas. However this high level of dilution limits the specific output of the HCCI engine to levels far below spark ignition or diesel engines. The high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> is a major challenge for the HCCI engine. This study utilized a single cylinder research to examine the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> and possible methods to extend it. The details of the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> were first explored {{across a range of}} intake temperatures, boost pressures, trapped residual fractions, equivalence ratios and external EGR ratios for a gasoline fueled HCCI engine. A significant finding was that the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> always occurs at the misfire limit and that for a given pressure rise rate constraint, the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> occurs at lowest possible intake pressure and trapped residual fraction needed to prevent misfire. A possible means to allow operation at higher boost pressures is to utilize cooled external EGR or to reduce the intake temperature. For a given burn fraction, increasing the EGR rate or reducing the intake temperature provided reduced MPRR. (cont.) However with these changes, the misfire limit also shifted such that the value of the maximum load does not materially change. Thus boosting coupled with EGR or intake temperature reduction {{can not be used to}} significantly extend the high <b>load</b> <b>limit.</b> A correlation was developed for the burn duration. Multi-zone combustion simulations were used to confirm the form of this correlation. The multi-zone based correlations were then used to quantitatively examine the potential of thermal stratification as a means to extend the high <b>load</b> <b>limit.</b> It was shown that for a doubling of the width of the in-cylinder temperature distribution, a 30 % increase in the high <b>load</b> <b>limit</b> is possible. by Robert J.
