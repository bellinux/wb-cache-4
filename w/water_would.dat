5|$|Defence from thermal {{weapons and}} fire attacks was usually water or other liquids such as urine; hides were soaked and draped over {{vulnerable}} wooden hoardings and siege engines, and vats and barrels of liquid were collected and stored by defenders and attackers. Hides were hung in an overlapping manner {{so that any}} <b>water</b> <b>would</b> run down the whole structure to extinguish flames.|$|E
5|$|During {{trials of}} the first submarines, the {{propulsion}} system {{was found to be}} prone to failure for a variety of reasons. Most failures were attributed to the fifteen-tank diesel fuel system: the tanks were designed to fill with salt water as they were emptied to maintain neutral buoyancy, but <b>water</b> <b>would</b> regularly enter the engines due to a combination of poor design, gravity separation of the fuel and water being insufficient, and operator error resulting from poor training. Problems were also caused by bacterial contamination of the diesel fuel, which, along with the salt <b>water,</b> <b>would</b> cause the fuel pumps to rust and other components to seize. The fuel-related issues were solved by installing coalescers, improving training and operational procedures, and adding biocides to the fuel.|$|E
5|$|Following test Baker {{decontamination}} problems, the United States Navy equipped newly constructed {{ships with}} a CounterMeasure WashDown System (CMWDS) of piping and nozzles to cover exterior {{surfaces of the}} ship with a spray of salt water from the firefighting system when nuclear attack appeared imminent. The film of flowing <b>water</b> <b>would</b> theoretically prevent contaminants from settling into cracks and crevices.|$|E
50|$|Roger <b>Waters</b> <b>would</b> {{regularly}} {{perform this}} song on his In the Flesh Tour with Jon Carin and Doyle Bramhall II replacing Gilmour on the vocals and guitars respectively. <b>Waters</b> <b>would</b> also perform the song {{to open the}} second set of his Us + Them Tour shows with Dave Kilminster and Jonathan Wilson on guitars, and the latter on vocals.|$|R

5|$|Since {{trade and}} {{commerce}} typically involve items significantly more massive than one gram, and since a mass standard made of <b>water</b> <b>would</b> be inconvenient and unstable, {{the regulation of}} commerce necessitated the manufacture of a practical realization of the water-based definition of mass. Accordingly, a provisional mass standard was made as a single-piece, metallic artifact one thousand times as massive as the gram—the kilogram.|$|E
5|$|Air-landing {{obstacles}} {{were not}} the only tactic Rommel used against aerial invaders. Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that glider troops and paratroops landing in the <b>water</b> <b>would</b> drown. He ordered machine gun crews to cover the exits of fields that were bounded by bocage—tall, dense hedgerows—so that glider infantry and paratroopers would come under fire as they moved out of their landing area. The bocage hedgerows themselves were the worse hazard to safe glider landings, and caused more glider casualties than Rommelspargel.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as smooth as possible so that the flow of <b>water</b> <b>would</b> not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.|$|E
50|$|The inland <b>waters</b> <b>would</b> have {{contained}} mammal {{species such}} as Castor fiber (beaver), Lutra lutra (otter) and species of fish such as Esox lucius (northern pike) and Siluris glanis (catfish).|$|R
25|$|Osiris-beds {{were common}} in ancient Egypt and were clay {{representations}} {{of a dead}} Osiris which when <b>watered</b> <b>would</b> sprout shoots in the spring, thus representing his power to control nature even after his death.|$|R
50|$|With {{plans to}} open in 1999, the Castle of <b>Waters</b> <b>would</b> have a {{surprise}} inside, a roller coaster in the dark. Possess a beautiful tematatização and work together with the Water Show. Unfortunately these projects were discontinued.|$|R
5|$|An {{experimental}} coating able {{to change}} color was tested on Royal Navy submarines. On suggestion by Professor Leslie Cromby, lead oxide {{was applied to the}} hull, enabling it to become black on application of a solution of sulphite and sea water for night operation. For day sailing, a solution of hydrogen peroxide and sea <b>water</b> <b>would</b> be applied, producing sulphate and returning the hull to a white colour desirable for daytime conditions.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, Wigner and his Theoretical Group that {{included}} Alvin Weinberg, Katharine Way, Leo Ohlinger, Gale Young and Edward Creutz produced a {{design for a}} production reactor with water cooling. The choice of water as a coolant was controversial, as it was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations were correct and that with the purer graphite and uranium that was now available, <b>water</b> <b>would</b> work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium as a coolant would delay the project.|$|E
5|$|On 12 February 2003, Dechaineux was {{operating}} near her maximum safe diving depth {{off the coast}} of Western Australia when a seawater hose burst. The high-pressure seawater flooded the lower engine room before the hose was sealed off: it was estimated that if the inflow had continued for another twenty seconds, the weight of the <b>water</b> <b>would</b> have prevented Dechaineux from returning to the surface. The RAN recalled the Collins-class submarines to base after the incident; after engineers were unable to determine any flaws in the pipes that could have caused the incident, the maximum safe diving depth of the class was reduced.|$|E
50|$|Tangke is a {{saltwater}} lagoon {{located within}} Gigantes Sur. It {{is surrounded by}} cliffs. One local myth surrounding Tangke states that the <b>waters</b> <b>would</b> magically rise every year on June 24 during the feast of Saint John the Baptist.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1790s, the {{original}} town {{site of the}} Town of York was established along its south bank. Its <b>waters</b> <b>would</b> be used by its first industries. The disappearance of the creek came in phases in the 19th century: ...|$|R
5|$|Stream downcutting {{continued}} {{along with}} canyon-forming {{processes such as}} mass wasting; sediment-rich and abrasive flood stage <b>waters</b> <b>would</b> undermine cliffs until vertical slabs of rock sheared away. This process continues to be especially efficient with the vertically jointed Navajo Sandstone.|$|R
5|$|The Wayne Sewerage Company was {{incorporated}} on December 1, 1902 and constructed and maintained sewers in Radnor township. It purchased an eleven-acre tract along the creek {{to build a}} sewer system and built an engine house with boilers to purify sewage. After it was purified, the <b>water</b> <b>would</b> be released into Ithan Creek where, the company claimed, it posed no threat to human health. Despite this, on December 4, 1905, the State Board of Health {{filed a lawsuit against}} the company alleging raw sewage was being illegally dumped into the creek. As a result, a judge sided with the Board of Health and a new plant was constructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of Lake Tauca depended on {{a reduction in}} air temperature over the Altiplano {{and an increase in}} precipitation, which may have been caused by shifts in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and increased easterly winds. It was originally supposed that glacial melting might have filled Lake Tauca, but the quantity of <b>water</b> <b>would</b> not have been sufficient to fill the whole lake. The lake was accompanied by glacial advance, noticeable at Cerro Azanaques and Tunupa. Elsewhere in South America, water levels and glaciers also expanded during the Lake Tauca phase.|$|E
5|$|The lack of armour on {{both ends}} of the design sparked controversy: after the former Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy Edward James Reed visited the ships under construction, he criticized this {{particular}} design feature, arguing that in case of damage to either end the entering <b>water</b> <b>would</b> have compromised the stability; the new Italian Minister of the Navy, Simone Pacoret di Saint-Bon, replied during a Parliament session that such an event was very unlikely, as it could happen only if all the bulkeads of the watertight compartments were destroyed.|$|E
50|$|Fox was {{sheathed}} in wood and copper, to fit her for tropical waters. The hull of an unsheathed steel vessel operating in warm <b>waters</b> <b>would</b> usually become so encrusted with barnacles that its speed would be seriously affected within six months.|$|R
50|$|It was {{announced}} in early March 2016 the <b>Waters</b> <b>would</b> race full-time in the 2016 V8 Supercars Championship with Prodrive Racing Australia driving the #6 Ford FG X Falcon, with Mostert moving to the #55 Rod Nash Racing customer car.|$|R

5|$|The {{location}} of Nemausus (Nîmes) was somewhat inconvenient {{when it came}} to providing a water supply. Plains lie to the city's south and east, where any sources of <b>water</b> <b>would</b> be at too low an altitude to be able to flow to the city, while the hills to the west made a water supply route too difficult from an engineering point of view. The only real alternative was to look to the north and in particular to the area around Ucetia (Uzès), where there are natural springs.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{geologic}} {{forms on}} the planet to suggest the presence of water over the past billion years. However, {{there is no reason}} to suppose that Venus was an exception to the processes that formed Earth and gave it its water during its early history, possibly from the original rocks that formed the planet or later on from comets. The common view among research scientists is that <b>water</b> <b>would</b> have existed for about 600million years on the surface before evaporating, though some such as David Grinspoon believe that up to 2billion years could also be plausible.|$|E
5|$|To {{demonstrate}} Henry's immortality, Miller {{decided that}} Henry would die and {{would feel the}} pain every time he died. Anything on Henry's body would disappear with his body during each death. Miller felt that Henry's naked rebirth in <b>water</b> <b>would</b> be an interesting {{way to keep the}} show's protagonist alive during the series by completing the death and rebirth process; the nakedness would create several comedic moments within the series. Miller intended to use Henry's death and rebirth process sporadically after the first two episodes so that the series would focus on Henry's long life.|$|E
60|$|Long ere {{the last}} of the column could hope to reach the upper pits which lay above the danger point I was {{convinced}} that the <b>waters</b> <b>would</b> surge after us in overwhelming volume, and that fully half the expedition would be snuffed out.|$|R
2500|$|Similarly, Rabbi Akiva {{said that}} the Israelites {{advanced}} to enter the Reed Sea, but they turned backwards, fearing that the <b>waters</b> <b>would</b> come over them. The tribe of Judah sanctified God's Name and entered the sea first, as [...] says, [...] "Judah became his sanctuary (in order to sanctify God), Israel his dominion." [...] The Egyptians wanted to follow the Israelites, but they turned back, fearing that the <b>waters</b> <b>would</b> return over them. God appeared before them like a man riding {{on the back of}} a mare, as it is said in Song of Songs [...] "To a steed in Pharaoh's chariots." [...] Pharaoh's horse saw the mare of God, and it neighed and ran into the sea after it.|$|R
50|$|According to Greenpeace the Arctic {{is under}} threat from both {{climate change and}} {{increased}} oil drilling. Arctic oil drilling is a dangerous, high-risk enterprise and an oil spill under these icy <b>waters</b> <b>would</b> allegedly have a catastrophic impact {{on one of the}} most pristine, unique, and beautiful landscapes on earth.|$|R
5|$|With the {{prospect}} of the Chard Canal in particular damaging trade on the Parrett, four traders from Langport including Vincent Stuckey and Walter Bagehot, who together operated a river freight business, commissioned the engineer Joseph Jones to carry out a survey for the Parrett Navigation which was then put before Parliament. It was supported by Brunel and a large quantity of documentary evidence. Objections from local landowners were handled by including clauses in the Parrett Navigation Act to ensure that surplus <b>water</b> <b>would</b> be channelled to the Long Sutton Catchwater Drain by culverts, siphons, and sluices, and the Act of Parliament was passed on 4 July 1836.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{watertight}} bulkheads extended {{well above}} the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and <b>water</b> <b>would</b> spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling {{across the top of}} an ice cube tray. This was what happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.6 boiler room, a total of five compartments. Titanic was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E
5|$|Consisting of Ottoman, Arab and Circassian soldiers, the II Corps {{had three}} options: to {{pass to the}} east of Amman along the Darb el Haj direct to Damascus, {{although}} <b>water</b> <b>would</b> be a problem in that desert region, to attack Chaytor's Force at Amman, or to move westwards, to try to get to the Jordan Valley. Patterson's Column was ordered to entrench Shunet Nimrin, Es Salt and Suweileh in case they moved westwards. On the Royal Fusiliers' right the 2nd Light Horse Brigade closely guarded the country to the south, in particular the Madaba to Naur to Ain Hummar road across the plateau, with a strong detachment occupying Ain es Sir. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade sent a detachment at about midday on 26 September to investigate a report of Ottoman and German soldiers with guns at Er Rumman, but none were found. They subsequently sent a second detachment east of Amman to watch the Darb el Haj. The 20th Indian Brigade of infantry arrived after dark on 26 September to take over garrison duties at Amman.|$|E
50|$|The Kalaus is a north-flowing {{river on}} the Black Sea-Caspian Steppe of {{southern}} Russia, in Stavropol Krai. It is {{a tributary of}} the Manych River. Formerly, when it reached the Manych, part of its <b>waters</b> <b>would</b> flow east and part west. Today a low dam blocks flow into the East Manych.|$|R
5000|$|The {{island was}} created when Penton Hook Lock was built, {{although}} before the lock {{was built in}} 1815, Thames <b>waters</b> <b>would</b> often flood across {{the neck of the}} [...] "hook".

2500|$|Great Britain {{abolished}} slavery {{effective in}} August 1834 in the British Isles, {{most of its}} colonies and their waters.
