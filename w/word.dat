I was interested in doing analysis in this topic because loan <b>words</b> could {{not be separated from}} the development of our national language, Indonesia. I chose " Dialog Siang " program because this program covered current issues that happened in our country. The {{purpose of this study was}} to know the types of loan <b>words</b> that occurred in the Dialog Siang as well as to know the predominant types of loan <b>words</b> <b>words.</b> Here, the writer classified loan <b>words</b> into two parts: foreign loan <b>words</b> and local loan <b>words</b> according to Samsuri?s theory, which stated that foreign loan <b>words</b> can be classified into simple <b>words,</b> complex <b>words,</b> and translated <b>words.</b> On the other hand, local loan <b>words</b> can be classified into local root <b>words,</b> complex local root <b>words,</b> local root <b>words</b> with Indonesian affixes and Indonesian root <b>words</b> with local affixes. The source of the data consisted of loan <b>words</b> {{used by the}} participants in Dialog Siang. The data were recorded for about four days from 26 August until 29 August 2002, with different topics of discussion. After collecting the data, the writer analyzed the types of foreign loan <b>words</b> and local loan <b>words</b> in the form of parts of speech. The writer found that there were 94. 6 % of English loan <b>words</b> in the whole data. Here, English loan <b>words</b> consisted of 12. 70 % in the form of simple <b>words,</b> 86. 9 % in the form of complex <b>words</b> and 0. 4 % in the form of translated <b>words.</b> There were 5. 4 % Javanese loan <b>words</b> <b>words.</b> Javanese loan <b>words</b> consisted of 57. 1 % in the form of local root <b>words,</b> and 42. 9 % in the form of local root <b>words</b> with Indonesian affixes; however, the occurrences of complex local <b>words</b> and Indonesian root <b>words</b> with local affixes did not happened in this data. After that, the writer concluded that the occurrences of loan <b>words</b> mostly happened in foreign language, English. In addition, Javanese loan <b>words</b> occurred less in this data. It showed that English <b>words</b> were commonly used in Indonesian vocabulary especially in the formal situation...|$|R

In Multiple Choice, the player must select the correct French or Spanish translation of an English <b>word</b> from four choices in a limited time frame. Hit-A-Word is a Whac-A-Mole game in which the player must hit the most amount of moles with the correct translation of an English <b>word</b> within the allotted time. <b>Word</b> Find is a <b>word</b> search in which the player must find the French or Spanish translations of a set of English words or phrases. In Flash Cards, the player is given a French or Spanish <b>word</b> and must choose the card with the proper English translation. In Memory, the player must select from a set of face-down cards a French or Spanish <b>word</b> and its English translation. Bridge Builder tests sentence structure; the player has to construct a proper sentence from a set of given words. In Spelltastic, the player listens to a French or Spanish <b>word</b> and spells it using a keyboard within the allotted time. For Fill-in-the-Blank, the player selects the proper conjugation of a French or Spanish verb within a sentence.|$|E

However, the inscription of Vaballathus is clearer as the <b>word</b> PNRTTʿ is not a Palmyrene <b>word</b> but a direct Palmyrene translation of the Greek term Epanorthotes which is usually an equivalent to corrector.|$|E
