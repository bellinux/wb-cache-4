Using a scaled-up version of Michelson's apparatus connected directly to Amsterdam's main <b>water</b> <b>conduit,</b> Zeeman was able to perform extended measurements using monochromatic light ranging from violet (4358 Å) through red (6870 Å) to confirm Lorentz's modified coefficient.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the <b>water</b> <b>conduit</b> was as smooth as possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.|$|E
5|$|Under Malamir and Presian, Isbul headed Bulgaria's {{successful}} {{campaigns against}} the Byzantines in southern Thrace and Macedonia, {{which led to}} a significant territorial expansion of the Bulgarian realm. As a co-ruler of Malamir, Isbul also financed the construction of a <b>water</b> <b>conduit</b> in the capital Pliska. As second-in-command, Isbul held enormous power and wealth, and was unusually often mentioned beside the name of the ruler in inscriptions. Due to his merits, Isbul has been described as an architect of medieval Bulgarian statehood by historians.|$|E

5|$|The {{method of}} {{construction}} is fairly well understood by historians. The {{patron of the}} aqueduct– a rich individual or the city of Nîmes itself– would have hired a large team of contractors and skilled labourers. A surveyor or mensor planned the route using a groma for sighting, the chorobates for levelling, {{and a set of}} measuring poles five or ten Roman feet long. His figures and perhaps diagrams were recorded on wax tablets, later to be written up on scrolls. The builders may have used templates to guide them with tasks that required a high degree of precision, such as carving the standardised blocks from which the <b>water</b> <b>conduit</b> was constructed.|$|E

5000|$|The {{building}} technique of the Bedouin {{is taken from}} the Byzantine settlers, so {{it is often difficult}} to tell structures apart. Furthermore, the Bedouin often used the ruins in later times. But there are telling clues. Byzantine buildings were scattered close to each other in small settlements, and round buildings are most likely to be from the Byzantine period. While the Bedouin have storage rooms constructed under rocks, they would have been too low for hermits to pray in an upright, kneeling position. [...] "Rounded-walls, niches and shelves and tiny doors are typical of Byzantine stone dwellings. Charasteristic how the stones are laid without mortar and the absence of a roof. You can also find traces of ancient <b>water</b> systems or <b>conduits</b> which were used to direct rain water to the settlement and for irrigation use.

500|$|During {{his time}} as co-ruler and kavhan of Malamir, Isbul financed the {{construction}} of a <b>water</b> <b>conduit</b> (aqueduct) or fountain in Pliska, which he donated to Malamir. That construction was the occasion for a great feast, which the ruler organised, and for gifts to the nobility, all of it testifying to Isbul's affluence. In the source about the construction, Isbul is hailed alongside Malamir: [...] "May God let the God-appointed ruler live a hundred years together with the kavhan Isbul". Normally, such blessings were only directed at the ruler, and this is the only case from the First Bulgarian Empire which references another person. The inscription also mentions Isbul's old age at the time.|$|E
500|$|The {{first level}} of the Pont du Gard adjoins a road bridge that was added in the 18th century. The <b>water</b> <b>conduit</b> or specus, which is about [...] high and [...] wide, is carried {{at the top of}} the third level. The upper levels of the bridge are {{slightly}} curved in the upstream direction. It was long believed that the engineers had designed it this way deliberately to strengthen the bridge's structure against the flow of water, like a dam wall. However, a microtopographic survey carried out in 1989 showed that the bend is caused by the stone expanding and contracting by about [...] a day under the heat of the sun. Over the centuries, this process has produced the current deformation.|$|E

SGD originating in freshwater aquifers to ocean or from saline water to aquifers has been recently isolated as a major factor influencing the coastal zone (Taniguchi et al. 2002). The groundwater discharging from coastal aquifers and/or the incoming saline water contains elevated concentrations of nutrients, inorganic and organic substances and radionuclides triggering the coastal areas towards environmental degradation.|$|R
2500|$|In 1927, the Italian {{dictator}} Benito Mussolini ordered Guido Ucelli {{to drain}} the lake and recover the ships. With {{the help of the}} Regia Marina, the Italian Army, industry, and private individuals, an ancient Roman underground <b>water</b> <b>conduit</b> linking the lake to farms outside the crater was reactivated. After connecting the conduit to a floating pumping platform, on 20 October 1928, the lake level began dropping. By 28 March 1929, the water level had dropped , and the first ship (prima nave) broke the surface. By 10 June 1931, the prima nave had been recovered and the second ship (seconda nave) was exposed. By this time the water level had dropped more than [...] with over 40 million cubic meters of water removed. As a result of the weight reduction, on 21 August 1931, 500,000 cubic meters of mud erupted from the underlying strata causing [...] of the lake floor to subside. Work ceased and, while the risks of continuing the project were debated, the lake began refilling. As the seconda nave had already partially dried out, the submersion caused considerable damage. On 10 November 1931, the Minister of Public Works ordered the project and all research abandoned.|$|E

2500|$|Hebron {{was one of}} {{the last}} cities of Palestine to fall to the Islamic {{invasion}} in the 7th century, possibly the reason why Hebron is not mentioned in any traditions of the Arab conquest. After the fall of the city, Jerusalem's conqueror, Caliph Omar ibn al-Khattab permitted Jewish people to return and to construct a small synagogue within the Herodian precinct. When the Rashidun Caliphate established rule over Hebron in 638, they converted the Byzantine church at the site of Abraham's tomb into a mosque. It became an important station on the caravan trading [...] route from Egypt, and also as a way-station for pilgrims making the yearly hajj from Damascus. Catholic bishop Arculf who visited the Holy Land during the Umayyad rule described the city as unfortified and poor. In his writings he also mentioned camel caravans transporting firewood from Hebron to Jerusalem, which implies there was a presence of Arab nomads in the region at that time. Trade greatly expanded, in particular with Bedouins in the Negev (al-Naqab) and the population to the east of the Dead Sea (Baḥr Lūṭ). According to Anton Kisa, Jews from Hebron (and Tyre) founded the Venetian glass-industry in the 9th century. Islam did not view the town significant before the 10th-century, it being almost absent in Muslim literature of the period. Jerusalemite geographer al-Muqaddasi, writing in 985 described the town as follows:'Habra (Hebron) is the village of Abraham al-Khalil (the Friend of God)...Within it is a strong fortress...being of enormous squared stones. In the middle of this stands a dome of stone, built in Islamic times, over the sepulchre of Abraham. The tomb of Isaac lies forward, in the main building of the mosque, the tomb of Jacob to the rear; facing each prophet lies his wife. The enclosure has been converted into a mosque, and built around it are rest houses for the pilgrims, so that they adjoin the main edifice on all sides. A small <b>water</b> <b>conduit</b> has been conducted to them. All the countryside around this town for about half a stage has villages in every direction, with vineyards and grounds producing grapes and apples called Jabal Nahra...being fruit of unsurpassed excellence...Much of this fruit is dried, and sent to Egypt.|$|E

40|$|Any surface {{exposed to}} {{untreated}} water {{provides an opportunity}} for the settlement and subsequent growth of organisms. The cooling <b>water</b> <b>conduits</b> of a power station provides an ideal habitat for such species. Given these perfect conditions, settlement occurs readily and growth can be rapid until it begins to interfere with the operational systems and finally leads to their failure. This phenomenon is known as bio-fouling. Worldwide, mussels cause serious problems in cooling <b>water</b> <b>conduits.</b> Because of the great economical damage, caused by these fouling-organisms, biocides are being used to control them. To use these chemicals properly, knowledge of the lifecycle of these organisms is indispensable and monitoring is necessary. Using the Scheldt water as cooling water, a lot of companies in the harbour of Antwerp have problems with fouling organisms. In this research, Mytilopsis leucophaeata, the brackish water mussel, will be used as modelspecies for the study of biofouling control. The problems and possible solutions will be examined at the site of BASF, Antwerp. The objective of the project is to achieve an efficient and rational use of biocides to control bio-fouling caused by M. leucophaeata and as such minimise their harm in the environment and in the cooling <b>water</b> <b>conduits.</b> This objective is divided in four aspects: 1. Population dynamics of M. leucophaeata Weekly sampling of the incoming cooling water gives us a reliable view on the population dynamics of M. leucophaeata. 2. Development of an 'early warning system' Knowledge about the population dynamics of M. leucophaeata will be used to develop an 'early warning system' to use biocides at the right time (= the fouling organisms most vulnerable stage) and in the right dosage. 3. Influencing environmental factors on the lifecycle of M. leucophaeata Experimental research will test the influences of the environmental parameters on the lifecycle, possibly simplifying the prediction of or reducting the recruitment success of M. leucophaeata. 4. Prediction of the recruitment success of M. leucophaeata A model will allow to (1) considerately dose biocides, dependent on the expected recruitment success and (2) if possible, reduce the recruitment success of M. leucophaeata by manipulation of the relevant environmental factors of the incoming cooling water...|$|R
