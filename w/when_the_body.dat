5|$|Burnett's subversive {{activities}} did not {{go unnoticed}} by his colleagues in Congress. He was absent <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> reconvened December 2, 1861. The following day, Indiana representative W. McKee Dunn introduced a resolution to expel Burnett from Congress. The resolution passed easily, removing Burnett from the seat he had occupied continuously since 1855.|$|E
5|$|The Indian flag {{cannot be}} flown at half-mast on Republic Day (26 January), Independence day (15 August), Gandhi Jayanti (2 October), National Week (6–13 April) or state {{formation}} anniversaries, except over buildings housing {{the body of}} the deceased dignitary. However, even in such cases, the flag must be raised to full-mast <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is moved from the building.|$|E

5|$|Much media {{attention}} focused on the airfield <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of Diana, Princess of Wales, arrived there from Villacoublay airfield, in Paris, France, after her death {{in a car crash}} in the city on 31 August 1997. The Queen's Colour Squadron, then based at neighbouring RAF Uxbridge, acted as the bearer party, while the flight was met by the Prime Minister, the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Lieutenant of Greater London, Secretary of State for Defence, the RAF Northolt station commander and the RAF Chaplain-in-Chief.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies are}} {{typically}} found growing in large numbers, sometimes in clumps, though solitary specimens are occasionally encountered. Several bodies can be connected at their bases, or younger bodies can {{grow out of}} the bases of older ones. The youngest fruit bodies are conical in shape. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> reaches around 2mm in length, {{the tip of the}} cone begins to expand, forming the head. This is the stage at which the hymenium becomes differentiated {{from the rest of the}} body, and the bodies quickly reach their mature form, maturing only through growth after that point. Fruit bodies can be infected by the mould Hypomyces leotiarum.|$|E
5|$|The two snails {{circle around}} each other {{for up to six}} hours, {{touching}} with their tentacles, and biting lips and the area of the genital pore, which shows some preliminary signs of the eversion of the penis. As the snails approach mating, hydraulic pressure builds up in the blood sinus surrounding the organ housing the dart. Each snail manoeuvres to get its genital pore in the best position, close to the other snail's body. Then, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of one snail touches the other snail's genital pore, it triggers the firing of the dart.|$|E

5|$|Cases {{have been}} {{recorded}} by medical authorities since the 16th century, though some archaeological cases provide evidence for its occurrence in many periods of human history. While cases of postmortem fetal expulsion have always been rare, the phenomenon has been recorded under disparate circumstances and is occasionally seen in a modern forensic context <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of a pregnant woman lies undisturbed and undiscovered for some time following death. There are also cases whereby a fetus may become separated {{from the body of}} the pregnant woman about the time of death or during decomposition, though because those cases are not consistent with the processes described here, they are not considered true cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E
5|$|He awaited {{execution}} of his sentence at the Union Correctional Institution. Shortly {{after the trial}} and conviction, his wife Debra filed for divorce and their marriage was formally dissolved a year later. Chandler was no longer allowed to see his daughter Whitney, and, in accordance with his ex-wife's wishes, he {{was not allowed to}} see later photographs of her. In July 2008, Chandler was on Florida's short list of executions. Profiling experts speculated that Chandler may have killed previously, {{based on the belief that}} a first-time killer would not be experienced, or bold enough, to abduct and kill three women at once. Chandler remained a suspect in the 1982 murder of a woman found floating off Anna Maria Island until 2011, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> was identified as 29-year-old Amy Hurst and her husband was arrested and charged with her murder. Chandler was never charged with another murder. All of his appeals of his 1994 conviction were denied; his last was in May 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Kinne was {{associated}} with two mysterious deaths. On March 19 of that year, her husband, James Kinne, was found {{shot in the head}} with the couple's two-year-old daughter playing nearby. Sharon Kinne claimed that the little girl, who had often been allowed to play with her father's guns, had accidentally shot him, and police were initially unable to disprove this theory. The case was closed as an accidental death and remained that way until the evening of May 27, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of twenty-three-year-old Patricia Jones, a local file clerk, was found by Kinne and a boyfriend in a secluded area. Investigation showed that Jones had been the wife of another of Kinne's boyfriends, and that Jones's husband had tried to break off his affair with Kinne shortly before Patricia Jones went missing. When Kinne admitted to having been the last person to speak to Patricia Jones, she was charged with Jones's death and, upon further investigation of his death, with the murder of James Kinne.|$|E

5|$|In Southeast Asia, the {{importance}} of the sea gave rise to many myths of epic ocean voyages, princesses on distant islands, monsters and magical fish lurking in the deep. In Northern Europe, kings were sometimes given ship burials <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> was laid in a vessel surrounded by treasure and costly cargo and set adrift on the sea. In North America, various creation stories have a duck or other creature dive {{to the bottom of the}} sea and bring up some mud out of which the dry land was formed. Atargatis was a Syrian deity known as the mermaid-goddess and Sedna was the goddess of the sea and marine animals in Inuit mythology.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the empty cenotaph, another new form of memorial, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, used the idea of burying one of the unidentified bodies from the war as a symbolic memorial {{to all of the}} lost soldiers. This idea had begun to emerge {{towards the end of the}} war, and was actively promoted by some British veterans' groups in 1919. Initially, however, it failed to gain traction with the government because of the success of the Whitehall Cenotaph, and a second memorial was felt to be unnecessary. Finally, in 1920, following lobbying by British cleric David Railton, Britain and France both decided to create a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, choosing an unknown body and creating a special memorial around it; the tombs were inaugurated on Armistice Day. The choice of location for the French tomb proved controversial, however, and it was not finalised until the following year, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> was laid to rest under the Arc de Triumph. The concept proved popular, and encouraged similar memorials in other countries.|$|E
5|$|On Spectrum's {{airborne}} headquarters, Cloudbase, Spectrum commander-in-chief Colonel White {{concludes that}} Brown was a traitor and was concealing a bomb on his person. Unaware of the Mysterons' subversion of his officers, he orders Scarlet's reconstruction {{to fly the}} President to a second Maximum Security Building in London. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of the original Brown is discovered {{at the scene of}} the SPC crash, it dawns on White that the President is in the hands of an impostor, and that the person whom he believed to be Scarlet is not human. Ignoring instructions to return to Cloudbase, with his Spectrum Jet under fire from the Angel fighter squadron, the Scarlet duplicate ejects himself and the President over southern England; on the ground, both the duplicate and the President, the latter being held hostage, set off towards London in a stolen car.|$|E

5|$|Overseas {{service for}} the 1st King's {{included}} a two-year residence in Nova Scotia, beginning in 1893. In January 1895, the battalion provided a 100-man guard of honour <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of Canadian Prime Minister John Thompson was returned from Britain. The battalion subsequently became stationed in the West Indies, then Cape Colony in 1897. The Second Boer War began two years later. Prior to {{the outbreak of the}} war, as the discord between the British and Boer republics escalated, the 1st King's formed a company of mounted infantry and underwent intensive training at Ladysmith, Natal Colony. War was declared on 11 October and Natal invaded by a Boer force under General Piet Joubert. General George White held authority over 13,000 British personnel dispersed throughout Natal. Heavy losses were incurred by the British in the first major engagements of the war, at Talana Hill and Elandslaagte. Retreat to Ladysmith, where the British concentrated its largest contingent, ensued. Having besieged Kimberley and Mafikeng, Boers converged upon Ladysmith and positioned artillery pieces on surrounding hills overlooking the town.|$|E
5|$|The Atlanta Journal {{wrote that}} {{a crowd of}} men, women, and {{children}} arrived on foot, in cars, and on horses, and that souvenir hunters cut away parts of his shirt sleeves. According to The New York Times, one of the onlookers, Robert E. Lee Howellrelated to Clark Howell, editor of The Atlanta Constitutionwanted to have the body cut into pieces and burned, and began to run around, screaming, whipping up the mob. Judge Newt Morris tried to restore order, {{and asked for a}} vote on whether the body should be returned to the parents intact; only Howell disagreed. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> was cut down, Howell started stamping on Frank's face and chest; Morris quickly placed the body in a basket, and he and his driver John Stephens Wood drove it out of Marietta.|$|E
5|$|The only grave {{goods were}} a pot found {{with the female}} adult body and partial remains of wicker, fur and linen with the other bodies. In the predynastic period bodies were usually buried naked and {{sometimes}} loosely wrapped. In such a burial, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is covered in warm sand, the environmental conditions mean {{that most of the}} water in the body is quickly evaporated or drained away, meaning that the corpse is naturally dried and preserved. This method was widely used in the pre-dynastic Egyptian period, before artificial mummification was developed. The natural mummification that occurred with these dry sand burials may have led to the original Egyptian belief in an after-death survival and started the tradition of leaving food and implements for an afterlife.|$|E
50|$|Electricity {{retailing}} {{began at}} the end of <b>the</b> 19th century <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> which generated electricity for their own use made supply available to third parties.

5|$|The story {{opens with}} a lengthy {{explanation}} of ratiocination. Dupin demonstrates his prowess by deducing his companion's thoughts as if through apparent supernatural power. The story then turns to the baffling double murder of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter at their home in the Rue Morgue, a fictional street in Paris. According to newspaper accounts, the mother {{was found in a}} yard behind the house, with multiple broken bones and her throat so deeply cut that her head fell off <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> was moved. The daughter was found strangled to death and stuffed upside down into a chimney. The murders occurred in a fourth-floor room that was locked from the inside; on the floor were found a bloody straight razor, several bloody tufts of gray hair, and two bags of gold coins. Several witnesses reported hearing two voices {{at the time of the}} murder, one male and French, but disagreed on the language spoken by the other. The speech was unclear, and every witness admits that he does not know the language he claims to have heard.|$|E
5|$|Burke and Hare's next {{victim was}} a {{familiar}} figure {{in the streets of}} Edinburgh, James Wilson, an 18-year-old man with a limp caused by deformed feet. He was mentally disabled and, according to Alanna Knight in her history of the murders, was inoffensive; he was known locally as Daft Jamie. Wilson lived on the streets and supported himself by begging. In November Hare lured Wilson to his lodgings with the promise of whisky, and sent his wife to fetch Burke. The two murderers led Wilson into a bedroom, the door of which Margaret Hare locked before pushing the key back under the door. As Wilson did not like whisky—he preferred snuff—he was not as drunk as most of the duo's victims; he was also strong, and fought back against the two attackers, but was overpowered and killed in the normal way. His body was stripped and his few possessions stolen: Burke kept a snuff box and Hare a snuff spoon. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> was examined the following day by Knox and his students, several of them recognised it to be Wilson, but Knox denied it could be anyone the students knew. When word started circulating that Wilson was missing, Knox dissected the body ahead of the others that were being held in storage; the head and feet were removed before the main dissection.|$|E
5|$|Several imaging {{methods can}} be used to assess the anatomy and {{function}} of the heart, including ultrasound (echocardiography), angiography, CT scans, MRI and PET. An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart used to measure the heart's function, assess for valve disease, and look for any abnormalities. Echocardiography can be conducted by a probe on the chest ("transthoracic") or by a probe in the esophagus ("transoesophageal"). A typical echocardiography report will include information about the width of the valves noting any stenosis, whether there is any backflow of blood (regurgitation) and information about the blood volumes at the end of systole and diastole, including an ejection fraction, which describes how much blood is ejected from the left and right ventricles after systole. Ejection fraction can then be obtained by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the volume of the filled heart (end-diastolic volume). Echocardiograms can also be conducted under circumstances <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is more stressed, in order to examine for signs of lack of blood supply. This cardiac stress test involves either direct exercise, or where this is not possible, injection of a drug such as dobutamine.|$|E
5000|$|In hypothermia, body {{temperature}} drops below that required for normal metabolism and bodily functions.

5000|$|After death, {{respiration}} in {{an organism}} ceases, depleting {{the source of}} oxygen used {{in the making of}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is required to cause separation of the actin-myosin cross-bridges during relaxation of muscle. When oxygen is no longer present, <b>the</b> <b>body</b> may continue to produce ATP via anaerobic glycolysis. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>body's</b> glycogen is depleted, the ATP concentration diminishes, and <b>the</b> <b>body</b> enters rigor mortis because it is unable to break those bridges.|$|R
