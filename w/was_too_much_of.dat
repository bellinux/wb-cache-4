5|$|Before {{releasing}} the film, Madonna invited {{a group of}} friends and co-workers to watch a rough three-hour cut of the film at a local theater in Notting Hill, and noted their feedback. General consensus was that there <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Kabbalah in the film, hence she decided to prune those segments considerably. The documentary premiered on MTV in the United States, on October 21, 2005, at 10:00 PM. She also showed it to the film students at New York's Hunter College and appeared for a Q session. This promotion was a part of mtvU's Stand In series, in which celebrities filled in for college professors.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the critical acclaim, players' response to the game remained deeply mixed over the cel-shaded design. Reception was comparatively warm in Japan, where various media commonly borrow an anime aesthetic, but was much more divided in North America. Some players appreciated the design and Miyamoto's vision for the game, but others criticized the choice. These fans felt that the new design <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a change from the more realistic designs of previous games, and found the new look childish. According to Stephen Totilo of Kotaku, much of the backlash came from a contemporary anxiety among fans that Nintendo was losing its edge by focusing on games for children, {{as opposed to the}} more mature, realistic fare developed by competitors.|$|E
5|$|Wyler felt Tunberg's draft <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a {{morality}} play overlaid {{with current}} Western political overtones, {{and that the}} dialogue was too modern-sounding. Zimbalist brought in playwright S. N. Behrman (who also wrote the script for Quo Vadis) and then playwright Maxwell Anderson to write drafts. Gore Vidal biographer Fred Kaplan states that British poet and playwright Christopher Fry was hired simultaneously with Vidal, although most sources (including Vidal himself) state that Vidal followed Anderson, and that Fry did not come aboard until Vidal was close to leaving the picture. Vidal arrived in Rome in early March 1958 to meet with Wyler. Vidal claimed that Wyler had not read the script, and that when he did so (at Vidal's urging) on his flight from the U.S. to Italy, he was upset with the modernist dialogue. Vidal agreed {{to work on the}} script for three months so that he would come off suspension and fulfill his contract with MGM, although Zimbalist pushed him to stay throughout the entire production. Vidal was researching a book on the 4th century Roman emperor Julian and knew a great deal about ancient Rome.|$|E

25|$|Meier told Donald that he {{was sure}} the Democrats would win the {{election}} because they had considerable information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Hughes {{that had never been}} released, and that it resided with Larry O'Brien. According to Fred Emery, O'Brien had been a lobbyist for Hughes in a Democrat-controlled Congress, and the possibility of his finding out about Hughes' illegal contributions to the Nixon campaign <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a danger for Nixon to ignore.|$|E

25|$|The {{period between}} the two World Wars saw an {{increase}} in the volume of traffic, as the motor car and Southampton Corporation Tramways evolved. It became essential to develop new routes around the Bargate as the central arch <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an obstruction. By 1931, a tram passed through the Bargate every 30 seconds and over the course of 14 hours, 2000 cars and 6000 bicycles would use the same narrow passage between Above Bar and the High Street. The photographs (below) illustrate the problem. Several old buildings and part of the medieval walls were demolished {{on both sides of the}} Bargate. In 1932, the Bargate was bypassed on its eastern side. The Bargate became an island when it was bypassed on its western side in 1938.|$|E
25|$|Composure {{would be}} {{required}} from Aftab Ahmed and Mohammad Ashraful, but the pair lasted only one over, Fernando bowling a slower ball to Ashraful which {{he could not get}} bat on and was lbw for 0. Aftab Ahmed saw off six more balls before he, too, was lbw, misreading the line of a ball from Maharoof, and captain Bashar completed the procession by edging to Sangakkara for 1. In 26 deliveries, Bangladesh had only scored seven runs, and they had lost six wickets in the process. The primary task for Bangladesh now were to survive 48 overs (their innings had been shortened slightly due to bad light), but even that <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a challenge, as the spinners Upul Chandana and Tillakaratne Dilshan shared the four last wickets, all caught, to see Bangladesh all out for 108.|$|E
25|$|With the {{eventual}} outcome {{in terms of}} both votes and seats varying substantially from the bulk of opinion polls released in the final months before the election, the polling industry received criticism for their inability to predict what was a surprisingly clear Conservative victory. Several theories have been put forward to explain the inaccuracy of the pollsters. One theory was that there had simply been a very late swing to the Conservatives, with the polling company Survation claiming that 13% of voters made up their minds in the final days and 17% {{on the day of the}} election. The company also claimed that a poll they carried out a day before the election gave the Conservatives 37% and Labour 31%, though they said they did not release the poll (commissioned by the Daily Mirror) on the concern that it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an outlier with other poll results.|$|E

25|$|Like his renowned British tenor {{predecessors}} Sims Reeves and Edward Lloyd, Coates had a famously protective wife. Moore {{refers to}} Coates' home life as serene, with an adorable spouse, sons and daughters; but he thought, despite Coates's good humour, {{he was not}} a happy person because he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a worrier. Coates developed financial headaches, too. He wasted a good deal of money in a legal case that he launched against the Performing Right Society, in which he argued that he should not have to pay a royalty to perform music in public which had been brought to him in manuscript, and which therefore, by agreeing to sing it, Coates had encouraged the publishers to publish. He lost the case, and it preyed on his mind and finances for long after, though he refused offers of financial support from other singers. In his last years he thought of going back on the stage and started to slim, but he was seized with anaemia and became permanently confined to bed, frustrated at being unable to assist his country as the Second World War took hold. In July 1940, Gerald Moore presented a half-hour broadcast in tribute to their work together, and received a last letter from him in friendship and gratitude.|$|E
500|$|During {{the initial}} {{storyboard}} pitch to Frederator Studios, Ward brought a guitar {{and played the}} episode's theme song. Frederator's CEO Fred Seibert was initially disinclined to make the short, feeling it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a [...] "student film" [...] and without much commercial appeal. Longtime colleagues, development executive Homan and production executive Kevin Kolde, convinced him otherwise, arguing that Seibert had actually laughed in the presentation, something {{that he did not}} often do. Frederator approved the pitch, and [...] "Adventure Time" [...] soon went into production.|$|E

500|$|When {{deciding}} the band's next single, Ray Davies pushed for [...] "Come Dancing" [...] {{to be released}} rather than [...] "Don't Forget to Dance," [...] which had been suggested by the record company as the first single from State of Confusion. The UK branch of Arista Records approved this decision, releasing 7-inch and 12-inch versions of the new single on 19 November 1982 with [...] "Noise" [...] as the B-side. However, Clive Davis initially had reservations; Davies recalls that Davis [...] "didn't {{want to put it}} out because it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an English subject matter". Davis also thought it was just a [...] "ditty" [...] and did not have enough substance to be a single.|$|E
500|$|IGN writer Cindy White {{considered}} the Jim and Dwight scenes {{to be one}} of the only highlights of the episode, especially due to them being the core element to the series. She criticized Robert's role in the episode and series, calling his character [...] "a tool ... I mean that in both senses", and also wrote that he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an inconsistent character. She concluded that while the episode was not [...] "terrible", it was a mediocre conclusion to the Florida storyline and wrote that [...] "I've got a suspicion that the best part of Season 8 is behind us". She ultimately gave the episode a 7.0/10. Jeffrey Hyatt of Screen Crave gave the episode a review of seven out of ten, writing that the only drawback for the episode was the Scranton subplot, because it [...] "turned really old, really fast", although he did compliment Lieberstein's performance in the episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} was very {{different}} from what was eventually published because he removed parts he felt were too sensational or dramatized. In the first draft, the story was told entirely {{from the point of view}} of Elmer, an intelligent chicken who is also an actor. Influenced by David Beauchard’s Epileptic and David Mazzucchelli’s City of Glass, Alanguilan altered the story's structure to focus on Elmer's son, Jake. Alanguilan also drew on an event from his teenage years, when he found his father's diary and read about the death of Gerry's uncle Dennis. The new format turned the story into one about Alanguilan, his parents, and his [...] "fears of losing them as they get older." [...] The original opening scene was a human attacking a chicken before being revealed as a film production. Alanguilan believed the scene <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a gimmick and moved it to the middle of the book.|$|E

500|$|Near {{the end of}} the {{production}} run of the show's fifth season, Parker and Stone contemplated having an episode in which Kenny was killed off permanently. The reasoning behind the idea was to genuinely surprise fans, and to allow an opportunity to provide a major role for Butters Stotch, a breakout character whose popularity was growing with the viewers and creators of the show. In the episode [...] "Kenny Dies", Kenny dies after developing terminal muscular dystrophy, while Parker and Stone claimed that Kenny would not be returning in subsequent episodes. The duo insisted they grew tired of upholding the tradition of having Kenny die in each episode. Stone stated that thinking of humorous ways to kill the character was initially fun, but became more mundane as the series progressed. When they determined that it would be too difficult to develop the character because he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a [...] "prop", Parker and Stone finally decided to kill off Kenny permanently.|$|E
500|$|Moon's {{first serious}} {{relationship}} was with Kim Kerrigan, whom he started dating in January 1965 after {{she saw the}} Who play at Le Disque a Go! Go! in Bournemouth. By {{the end of the}} year, she discovered she was pregnant; her parents, who were furious, met with the Moons to discuss their options and she moved into the Moon family home in Wembley. They were married on 17 March 1966 at Brent Registry Office, and their daughter Amanda was born on 12 July. The marriage (and child) were kept secret from the press until May 1968. Moon was occasionally violent towards Kim: [...] "if we went out after I had Mandy," [...] she later said, [...] "if someone talked to me, he'd lose it. We'd go home and he'd start a fight with me." [...] He loved Amanda, but his absences due to touring and fondness for practical jokes made their relationship uneasy when she was very young. [...] "He {{had no idea how to}} be a father," [...] Kim said. [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> a child himself." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} reviewers found the album overly long, while others felt Feldmann <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> an influence. Mike Damante at the Houston Chronicle said [...] "Feldmann's style {{is all over}} the record, as most tracks sound too formulaic, similar and run together. Other tracks are way too commercial, even for a band the size of blink.... California is {{ultimately}} a step back, rather a throwback." [...] David Anthony from The A.V. Club gave the album a C-, commenting, [...] "California is the sound of Blink-182 desperately trying to remain relevant by outsourcing its creativity. [...] is another homogenous addition to Feldmann's growing résumé. But this time he unintentionally removed the soul of pop-punk's clown princes in the process." [...] Nina Corcoran from Consequence of Sound was similarly negative: [...] "When not cranking the compression on the vocals, Feldmann ruins other songs with nonstop gimmicks: the piano interludes, the stiffened handclaps, the sappy title track." [...] Gwilym Mumford of The Guardian, focusing on the album's turbulent history regarding the departure of DeLonge, deemed the album [...] "a tired – and tiring – work." ...|$|E
