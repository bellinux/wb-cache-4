2500|$|Outmanned by Army, Crisler {{unveiled}} a platoon {{system in which}} separate groups played offense and defense. [...] According to one account, Crisler developed the two-platoon system [...] "in a bout of desperation." [...] Crisler later recalled, [...] "I reported the plan to the players and told them <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of fun. [...] At the end of three periods we were tied 7–7 and I knew it couldn't last. I knew sooner or later Army would overpower us. And that's what happened. We lost 28 to 7—but {{we had a lot}} of fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Basis steps {{demonstrate}} that the simplest provable sentences from [...] are also implied by , for any [...] (The proof is simple, since the semantic fact that a set implies any of its members, is also trivial.) The Inductive step will systematically cover all the further sentences that might be provable—by considering each case where we might reach a logical conclusion using an inference rule—and shows that if a new sentence is provable, it is also logically implied. (For example, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> rule telling us that from [...] "" [...] we can derive [...] " [...] or [...] ". In III.a We assume that if [...] is provable it is implied. We also know that if [...] is provable then [...] " [...] or [...] " [...] is provable. We {{have to show that}} then [...] " [...] or [...] " [...] too is implied. We do so by appeal to the semantic definition and the assumption we just made. [...] is provable from , we assume. So it is also implied by [...] So any semantic valuation making all of [...] true makes [...] true. But any valuation making [...] true makes [...] " [...] or [...] " [...] true, by the defined semantics for [...] "or". So any valuation which makes all of [...] true makes [...] " [...] or [...] " [...] true. So [...] " [...] or [...] " [...] is implied.) Generally, the Inductive step will consist of a lengthy but simple case-by-case analysis of all the rules of inference, showing that each [...] "preserves" [...] semantic implication.|$|E

6000|$|... "That is {{a clever}} hiding place," [...] he said. [...] "If I had not {{happened}} {{to notice that}} the bin was fixed <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> long search before we found it here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{ever thought}} your plan was folly," [...] said Marthon. [...] "Could you {{have brought the}} young people together, indeed, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hold on their gratitude, and a footing in their castle. But what chance of so {{handsome}} a youth wedding this old fool?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is good," [...] Charlie said. [...] "If he {{is bound}} for London, {{we shall be}} able to get into his company somehow; but if he had gone up to some quiet place north, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of {{difficulty}} in getting acquainted with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Uncle Regie, {{will you}} {{have a crack at}} the rabbits tomorrow? Brown said <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> day, and we have been keeping it for you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is good enough, Zaki. We {{will turn}} our robes inside out, {{so as to}} hide the patches, as {{otherwise}} <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hot reception." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An' if {{you could}} get your missus to go home by train from Summercove, George, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> little peace and quietness," [...] added the other.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! Then it can't be helped,' {{said the}} manager. 'If you <b>had</b> been, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> large woodcut {{of the last}} scene for the posters, showing the whole depth of the stage, with the pump and tubs in the middle; but, however, if you're not, it can't be helped.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> {{party of}} Ogres, the {{conversation}} assumed such a sanguine complexion.|$|R
60|$|THE YOUNGER MISS WETHERELL. I think <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{stretched}} <b>a</b> {{point in}} a case of illness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dunn isn't playing, nor is Waite," [...] said Barry, [...] "so they haven't got {{either of}} their proper halves. I say, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance of doing {{something}} today." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If it wasn't for the noise, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> song," [...] said Sam. [...] "As it is, I move Songbird recite 'Mary Had a Little Cow,' or {{something}} equally elevating." ...|$|E
6000|$|PROF. Well, I'll try {{and finish}} this to-night; then, to-morrow <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> jaunt. How about a theatre? There's a thing--they say --called [...] "Chinese Chops," [...] that's been running years.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's {{a mighty}} good thing we didn't drive in here. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> job turning around on that rough ice," [...] {{answered}} Spouter.|$|R
6000|$|... "We only shot a few, monsieur," [...] replied Francois, [...] "to put in {{the kettle}} for supper. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> loaded <b>a</b> canoe <b>had</b> we chosen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{have seen}} more of each other, and known more of each other, in this fortnight, than <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> in <b>an</b> {{acquaintance}} which <b>had</b> continued <b>a</b> life.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no' a good night," [...] {{said the}} seaman. [...] "I wouldna' say but <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> shift o' wind before long. They're telling me ye have {{brought up in}} the west bay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, grandpapa," [...] said Beatrice, {{catching}} {{hold of his}} hand, [...] "I want just {{to speak}} to you. Don't you think <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> little charade-acting on Monday to enliven the evening a little?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you find}} it so? It seems to me there's a great difference. I can imagine {{that at the end}} of ten years <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very {{pleasant}} correspondence. I shall have matured my epistolary style." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} thinking," [...] he said, [...] "that {{it seems a}} pity. You are so wonderful, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> found <b>an</b> easier and a less {{dangerous}} way to fortune." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was up to}} them to keep {{to their}} side of the road," [...] said Gif Garrison. [...] "Why, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> terrible {{accident}} if they had run into us!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can {{be thankful}} {{we were not}} hurt, Sam," [...] said his older brother. [...] "If our {{engineer}} hadn't stopped the train as he did <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> fearful smashup." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If Chief Downs can get {{us on the}} Limited," [...] he said, [...] "and if {{we catch}} the City of Boston, I think perhaps <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance of making Mr. Jocelyn Thew eat his words." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{that they}} were doomed we knew full well. The savages were {{counting}} on torturing them where <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{full view of the}} horrible spectacle, and we could not hope anything would happen to prevent it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt--no doubt, we station anew, however, each v'yage, {{according}} to experience; I'm {{not so sure}} that it would do to take even the cook from father to son, or <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pretty mess of it." ...|$|E
60|$|Now if it {{were not}} for that richly gilt Venetian table, the {{companion}} to which is in the possession of the Earl of Harrington, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> excellent view of that magnificently embellished recess, upon the merits of which Mr. Baylis is commenting to another oddly equipped gentleman. There certainly is something going forward in the fancy-dress way. On this Venetian table stands a French astronomical clock; upon it are silver medallions of Louis XIII. and XIV., and among its ornaments the monograms of these monarchs appear.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not know}} {{that you were going to}} church," [...] he said; [...] "I thought that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> walk together. Very likely I shall have to go away early to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what Lady Julia says, and I {{always find}} {{her to be}} right in things of that sort. And she says you'll <b>have</b> <b>a</b> better chance in going over there than you would here, {{if she were in}} the same house with you. If I was going to make love to a girl, of course I'd sooner have her close to me,--staying in the same house. I should think it the best fun in the world. And <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> dance, {{and all that kind of}} thing. But I couldn't make her come, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I’ll go {{over in the}} morning," [...] said Evans, who, {{now that}} things had been adjusted, was {{secretly}} disappointed that Miss Cooper had not witnessed the meeting. [...] "If you’re not going ashore, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hand o’ cards as soon’s we’re made fast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{wonder if}} all our people liked that plan, and <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> town picnic {{as we did}} once before. Let every one ask his or her mother, {{and see if we}} can't do it," [...] {{suggested}} Annie, eager for a whole day of merry-making.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's getting trickier every minute," [...] said Ellerby. [...] "The {{only thing}} is, {{if we can}} only stay in, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance. The wicket'll get better, and I don't believe they've any bowling at all bar de Freece. By George, Bob's out!... No, he isn't." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been <b>a</b> {{mile and}} a half from the camp, when in the quiet night air we heard the sound of the howl of a dog. We both stopped as if we were shot.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't {{do much of}} {{anything}} with the crowd gathering around. My! how the people do flock together when the least thing happens! If we had stayed there another minute or two, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> thousand people around us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish we had}} got out earlier, that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> made <b>a</b> run of it by day-light," [...] {{answered}} Roswell. [...] "Ten {{hours of}} such a wind, in my judgment, would carry us well towards clear water." ...|$|R
