Though Max Matsuura is officially credited as the producer of her records, he said of Hamasaki, [...] "Ayu is a very meticulous worker behind the scenes. A lot of the work she does by herself is more in the producer's arena. I think really <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> 'Produced by yumi amasaki'." [...] Until her single [...] "M", however, Hamasaki left the task of composing to her staff; as she has explained, [...] "I'm not a professional; I lack even basic knowledge about writing music." [...] However, she started to compose her own melodies after her staff had failed to compose a tune for [...] "M" [...] that appealed to her. Wanting to produce works faithful to her visions, Hamasaki took control of most aspects of her artistry. I Am... is representative of this stage in Hamasaki's career; she directed the production of its songs, videos, and artwork. She began to compose less after I Am...: whereas nearly all of I Am... was her work, only nine of Rainbows fifteen tracks were composed by her. She was even less involved {{in the composition of}} subsequent albums, composing two tracks on Memorial Address, three on My Story, and one on (Miss)understood; since Secret, none of the songs on her studio albums have listed her as a composer. With later albums, Hamasaki also began to delegate to her staff tasks she had once handled herself. Hamasaki cites Madonna, soul musicians Babyface and En Vogue, and rock bands Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple as her influences and states that she admires Michelle Branch, Kid Rock, Joan Osborne, Seiko Matsuda, Rie Miyazawa, and Keiko Yamada; these diverse influences have led to the variety of her own music. Hamasaki began commissioning remixes of her songs early in her career, and this practice also influenced the diversity of her music. Found on many of her records, these remixes span different genres of electronic dance music including Eurobeat, house, and trance, as well as acoustic genres such as classical and traditional Chinese music. She has employed Western as well as Japanese musicians; among those she has worked with are Above & Beyond, the Lamoureux Orchestra of France, and traditional Chinese music ensemble Princess China Music Orchestra. Hamasaki has released more than a hundred original songs; through them, she has covered a wide range of musical styles, such as dance, metal, R, progressive rock, pop, and classical. She uses different instruments and techniques including piano, orchestra, gospel choirs, guitars, traditional Japanese strings, music boxes, and effects such as yells, claps, and scratching.|$|E

[...] The Tribune wrote of Snow:"Undoubtedly {{one of the greatest}} was the late Neil Snow of Michigan. [...] Snow stood {{as one of the great}} football players of the game. [...] He was an all-American end and a great plunging full back. [...] As a ball player he batted over [...]390 for Michigan his last two years and received at least three good offers from big league clubs. [...] He was one of the best college first basemen that ever lived. [...] On the track Snow could high jump around six feet; he could put the shot 45 feet; he was a fine hurdler.

5000|$|Maimonides' {{admiration for}} the neo-Platonic {{commentators}} led him to doctrines which the later Scholastics did not accept. For instance, Maimonides was an adherent of [...] "negative theology" [...] (also known as [...] "Apophatic theology".) In this theology, one attempts to describe God through negative attributes.
