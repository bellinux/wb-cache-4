500|$|The Two Towers {{received}} critical acclaim; film site aggregator Rotten Tomatoes {{reported that}} 96 percent of critics were positive. CNN film critic Paul Clinton called The Two Towers an [...] "utter triumph", and writer Philip French of The Guardian {{noted in a}} review of the second film that [...] "these Tolkien films have a weight and seriousness that very few sword-and-sorcery pictures of the past 30-odd years have attained." [...] Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman remarked [...] "The Two Towers conjures an illusion of the gravity that you want from an emotionally charged storybook epic. Really, though, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> to is superbly staged battle scenes and moral alliances forged in earnest yet purged of the wit and dynamic, bristly ego that define true on-screen personality." [...] The film was also listed on a number of critics' lists; Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics named The Two Towers 2002's third best film, while Central Ohio Film Critics named The Two Towers that year's fifth best film and Southeastern Film Critics ranked it the eighth.|$|E

Jennings would anchor the program from New York City, the program's new base of operations. The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, {{and the beginning of}} what the media would deem the [...] "Big Three" [...] era of Jennings, Dan Rather of CBS, and Tom Brokaw of NBC. Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of NBC Nightly News was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. [...] "With me, Brokaw and Rather, I recognize that there will be the factor of three pretty faces," [...] he said. [...] "That's an inevitable byproduct of television.

Previous work has cited both design elements and the experience itself as being critical to internship success or failure. As the SJFC program requires two distinct required experiences, the purpose of this study was to explore the impact of these experiences on recent graduate’s confidence levels. Through survey data it was uncovered that participants who indicated a higher satisfaction with their final internship were more likely to end up in a career similar that of their last internship. Additionally, qualitative and quantitative data highlighted the design factors, such as learning opportunities and task variety as a very important factor in determining internship effectiveness. Qualitative data confirmed that many different aspects played a role in the effectiveness of the internship, but <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> to was the experience itself. Sport management program faculty, current and potential students, and internship supervisors would find this information useful due to the insight this study provides...|$|R

40|$|Njabulo Ndebele was the {{one first}} coining {{the notion of the}} ‘experiential transformation’ that South African {{whiteness}} had to undergo. It needed to absorb “new cultural experience as an essential condition for achieving a new sense of cultural rootedness” (Ballantine 106). The abolition of apartheid went along with the creation of the ‘Rainbow Nation South Africa’ that called for the re-positioning, re-defining and re-consideration of South African whiteness. <b>What</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> to, was an identity crisis among white Afrikaners. Zef embodies the feelings of shame caused by the Afrikaner heritage of apartheid among white Afrikaner youth. These feelings are expressed through extreme vulgarity and self-ridicule, originally mediated through comedy but lately popularised by the rap-rave group Die Antwoord. This thesis looks deeper into the Zef notion of whiteness represented in the imagery of Die Antwoord’s two music videos FOK JULLE NAAIERS (2012) and UGLY BOY (2014). The videos are analysed using the Foucauldian approach to representation and discourse, considering Foucault’s concept of discourse, the issue of power/knowledge and the question of the subject. It will look into how Die Antwoord constructs, but is also subjected to, their discourse of Zef white identity. In FOK JULLE NAAIERS and UGLY BOY the rap-rave group have the power to produce meaning and hence knowledge, but are also subject to a discursive formation. Finally, the discourse that is constructed by the imagery of FOK JULLE NAAIERS and UGLY BOY will be compared to the ‘experiential transformation’ of whiteness aimed for in the notion of the Rainbow Nation. The comparison will focus on what the ‘experientially transformed’ white identity entailed and if Die Antwoord’s Zef white identity has reached it, discussing its re-positioning, re-consideration and re-definition in the imagery of the two music videos...|$|R

50|$|Overall, a {{wide range}} of cost-effective, manageable, and {{innovative}} solutions are available to help aid Africa in producing clean, disease-free water. Ultimately <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> to is using technology appropriate for each individual community's needs. For the technology to be effective, it must conform to environmental, ethical, cultural, social, and economic aspects of each Africa community. Additionally, state governments, donor agencies, and technological solutions must be mindful of the gender disparity in access to water so as to not exclude women from development or resource management projects. If this can be done, with sufficient funding and aid to implement such technologies, it is feasible to eliminate clean water scarcity for the African continent by the Millennium Development Goal deadline of 2015.|$|E

What saves him from pedantry is that his films have occasional moments of erotic vibrancy.
