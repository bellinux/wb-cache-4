40|$|Abstract — In {{developing}} countries, {{construction waste}} becomes {{a serious problem}} in the future. Nowadays, the construction manager is difficult to quantify the waste production at the construction site. The waste quantity is known {{from the number of}} trucks carrying the waste. The quantity is important for the environmentalist to manage the landfill. This paper proposes a system to quantify the waste. The system was constructed based on images as data and digital image processing as a technique. To obtain the objectives, a set of technique was chosen and tested for evaluating the system. Measurement of volume is based on the geometric shape of the <b>waste</b> <b>stack.</b> It was tested on conical and validation using the truck capacity. The system showed the difference of volume was 0. 53 cubic meters (the percentage error about 11. 71 %) compared to the truck capacity.

40|$|Most {{widely used}} concept for {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW) incineration is combustion on a moving grate with energy recovery. In MSW incinerators fresh <b>waste</b> <b>stacked</b> on a grate enters the combustion chamber, heats up by radiation from the flame above the layer and ignition occurs. Ignition front propagates downwards producing heat for drying and devolatilisation of the fresh waste below until it reaches the grate. The present project is investigating the so called reversed combustion of waste on a grate. In this new concept the fuel layer is ignited by means of preheated air from below without any external ignition source. As a result a combustion front will be formed close to the grate and will propagate upwards. In order to investigate reversed combustion an experimental set-up that is able to simulate a real moving grate furnace is designed.

40|$|The {{overarching}} goal of {{the study}} presented in this dissertation {{is to develop a}} predictive computational model that can describe the detailed chemical and physical processes associated with pyrolysis, heat transfer and combustion for solid waste in a fixed bed gasifier. The work is applicable to optimization and prediction of the synthetic gas composition of solid waste gasifier operations. The dissertation is comprised of two main parts. In the first part, a predictive three-dimensional model for municipal solid waste gasification process is developed. The multiphase flow is described by a porous flow model using the SIMPLE algorithm with momentum interpolation. The governing equations are transformed into a generalized coordinate system to be applicable to realistic reactor geometry. A simplified global reaction mechanism is adapted for the gas-phase chemical reactions inside the gasifier. The pyrolysis process is described by a phenomenological Lagrangian pyrolysis model to determine the local porosity distribution and the corresponding pyrolysis rate of the waste. Computational results show three-dimensional distribution of the flow field, temperature, species concentration, porosity and the stack morphology under different parametric conditions. The effects of the inlet temperature and the feeding rate on the <b>waste</b> <b>stack</b> shape are studied. The results demonstrate that the model can properly capture the essential physical and chemical processes in the gasifier and thus {{can be used as a}} predictive simulation tool. In the second part, the Lagrangian pyrolysis model is extended to consider a multiple characteristic diameter (MCD) pyrolysis submodel in order to independently determine the rate of the local devolatilization, drying and charring processes associated with realistic biomass fuels. The porosity distribution is determined by introducing the local characteristic diameter of the virtual solid spheres representing the biomass fuel. Global homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions were adapted for the chemical reactions inside the gasifier. Synthetic gas compositions from model prediction are validated experiments conducted by Korean Institute of Energy Research (KIER) with good agreements. Model predictions are also compared with the results calculated by the equilibrium model in order to demonstrate that the proposed model improves the predictive capability of the complex nonequilibrium processes inside the gasifier...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} Capriccio, a scalable thread {{package for}} use with high-concurrency servers. While recent work has advocated event-based systems, we believe that threadbased systems can provide a simpler programming model that achieves equivalent or superior performance. By implementing Capriccio as a user-level thread package, we have decoupled the thread package implementation from the underlying operating system. As a result, we {{can take advantage of}} cooperative threading, new asynchronous I/O mechanisms, and compiler support. Using this approach, we are able to provide three key features: (1) scalability to 100, 000 threads, (2) efficient stack management, and (3) resource-aware scheduling. We introduce linked stack management, which minimizes the amount of <b>wasted</b> <b>stack</b> space by providing safe, small, and non-contiguous stacks that can grow or shrink at run time. A compiler analysis makes our stack implementation efficient and sound. We also present resource-aware scheduling, which allows thread scheduling and admission control to adapt to the system’s current resource usage. This technique uses a blocking graph that is automatically derived from the application to describe the flow of control between blocking points in a cooperative thread package. We have applied our techniques to the Apache 2. 0. 44 web server, demonstrating that we can achieve high performance and scalability despite using a simple threaded programming model...|$|R

40|$|Waste {{combustion}} on a grate {{with energy}} recovery {{is an important}} pillar of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in the Netherlands. In MSW incinerators fresh <b>waste</b> <b>stacked</b> on a grate enters the combustion chamber, heats up by radiation from the flame above the layer and ignition occurs. Typically, the reaction zone starts {{at the top of}} the waste layer and propagates downwards, producing heat for drying and devolatilization of the fresh waste below it until the ignition front reaches the grate. The control of this process is mainly based on empiricism. MSW is a highly inhomogeneous fuel with continuous fluctuating moisture content, heating value and chemical composition. The resulting process fluctuations may cause process control difficulties, fouling and corrosion issues, extra maintenance, and unplanned stops. In the new concept the fuel layer is ignited by means of preheated air (T > 220 °C) from below without any external ignition source. As a result a combustion front will be formed close to the grate and will propagate upwards. That is why this approach is denoted by upward combustion. Experimental research has been carried out in a batch reactor with height of 4. 55 m, an inner diameter of 200 mm and a fuel layer height up to 1 m. Due to a high quality two-layer insulation adiabatic conditions can be assumed. The primary air can be preheated up to 350 °C, and the secondary air is distributed via nozzles above the waste layer. During the experiments, temperatures along the height of the reactor, gas composition and total weight decrease are continuously monitored. The influence of the primary air speed, fuel moisture and inert content on the combustion characteristics (ignition rate, combustion rate, ignition front speed and temperature of the reaction zone) is evaluated. The upward combustion concept decouples the drying, devolatilization and burnout phase. In this way the moisture and inert content of the waste have almost no influence on the combustion process. In this paper an experimental comparison between conventional and reversed combustion is presente...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the methods}} being {{considered}} for safely disposing of Category 3 low-level radioactive wastes is to encase the waste in concrete. Such concrete encasement would contain and isolate the waste packages from the hydrologic environment and would act as an intrusion barrier. The current plan for waste isolation consists of <b>stacking</b> low-level <b>waste</b> packages on a trench floor, surrounding the stacks with reinforced steel, and encasing these packages in concrete. These concrete-encased <b>waste</b> <b>stacks</b> are expected to vary in size with maximum dimensions of 6. 4 m long, 2. 7 m wide, and 4 m high. The <b>waste</b> <b>stacks</b> {{are expected to have}} a surrounding minimum thickness of 15 cm of concrete encasement. These concrete-encased waste packages are expected to withstand environmental exposure (solar radiation, temperature variations, and precipitation) until an interim soil cover or permanent closure cover is installed, and to remain largely intact thereafter. Any failure of concrete encasement may result in water intrusion and consequent mobilization of radionuclides from the waste packages. The mobilized radionuclides may escape from the encased concrete by mass flow and/or diffusion and move into the surrounding subsurface environment. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the performance of the concrete encasement structure and the ability of the surrounding soil to retard radionuclide migration. The retardation factors for radionuclides contained in the waste packages can be determined from measurements of diffusion coefficients for these contaminants through concrete and fill material. Some of the mobilization scenarios include (1) potential leaching of waste form before permanent closure cover is installed; (2) after the cover installation, long-term diffusion of radionuclides from concrete waste form into surrounding fill material; (3) diffusion of radionuclides from contaminated soils into adjoining concrete encasement and clean fill material. Additionally, the rate of diffusion of radionuclides may be affected by the formation of structural cracks in concrete, the carbonation of the buried waste form, and any potential effect of metallic iron (in the form of rebars) on the mobility of radionuclides. The radionuclides iodine- 129 ({sup 129 }I), technetium- 99 ({sup 99 }Tc), and uranium- 238 ({sup 238 }U) are identified as long-term dose contributors in Category 3 waste (Mann et al. 2001; Wood et al. 1995). Because of their anionic nature in aqueous solutions, {sup 129 }I, {sup 99 }Tc, and carbonate-complexed {sup 238 }U may readily leach into the subsurface environment (Serne et al. 1989, 1992 a, b, 1993, and 1995). The leachability and/or diffusion of radionuclide species must be measured to assess the long-term performance of waste grouts when contacted with vadose-zone pore water or groundwater. Although significant research has been conducted on the design and performance of cementitious waste forms, the current protocol conducted to assess radionuclide stability within these waste forms has been limited to the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, Method 1311 Federal Registry (EPA 1992) and ANSI/ANS- 16. 1 leach test (ANSI 1986). These tests evaluate the performance under water-saturated conditions and do not evaluate the performance of cementitious waste forms within the context of waste repositories which are located within water-deficient vadose zones. Moreover, these tests assess only the diffusion of radionuclides from concrete waste forms and neglect evaluating the mechanisms of retention, stability of the waste form, and formation of secondary phases during weathering, which may serve as long-term secondary hosts for immobilization of radionuclides. The results of recent investigations conducted under arid and semi-arid conditions (Al-Khayat et al. 2002; Garrabrants et al. 2002; Garrabrants and Kosson 2003; Garrabrants et al. 2004; Gervais et al. 2004; Sanchez et al. 2002; Sanchez et al. 2003) provide valuable information suggesting structural and chemical changes to concrete waste forms which may affect contaminant containment and waste form performance. However, continued research is necessitated by the need to understand: the mechanism of contaminant release; the significance of contaminant release pathways; how waste form performance is affected by the full range of environmental conditions within the disposal facility; the process of waste form aging under conditions that are representative of processes occurring in response to changing environmental conditions within the disposal facility; the effect of waste form aging on chemical, physical, and radiological properties, and the associated impact on contaminant release.

For probe sampling it is prescrible to use a 2 -dimensional arrangement of {{a certain number of}} single probes. The particle distribution has to satisfy definite homogeneity conditions over the sampling area. Thus it is subject of the present experiments to observe the spatial distribution of the particle number density in the stack section of interest in order to optimize the positioning of the sampling area. The experiments were carried out at a 1 : 10 model of the stack of the repository project. The present paper deals with a non intrusive optical two dimensional field measurement technique that can determine the spatial distribution of particles, from this the concentration of particles of the measurement plane can be concluded. The concentration of particles must be low enough to allow isolated particles to be distinguished on a single image. In comparison with local measurements using probes this kind of measurement has the advantage of not disturbing the flow and of delivering a spatial information. This is how the effects of changing parameters can be made out. Parameters like this might be different in measurements utilizing probes without being recognize...|$|R
40|$|A {{pilot study}} was {{performed}} to evaluate formation, distribution and emission of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) from cement kilns that co-process fly ash from municipal solid <b>waste</b> incineration (MSWI). <b>Stack</b> gas and particulate samples from multiple stages in the process were collected and analyzed for PCDD/Fs. Stack emissions of PCDD/Fs were below the European Union limit for cement kilns (0. 1 ngTEQm(- 3)). PCDD/F concentrations in particulates from the cyclone preheater outlet, suspension preheater boiler, humidifier tower, and back-end bag filter were much higher than in other samples, which suggests that these areas are the major sites of PCDD/F formation. Comparison of PCDD/F homolog and congener profiles from different stages suggested that tetra- and penta-chlorinated furans were mainly formed during cement kiln co-processing of MSWI fly ash. Three lower chlorinated furan congeners, including 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzofuran, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 -pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -pentachlorodibenzofuran, were identified as dominant contributors to the toxic equivalents (TEQ) of the PCDD/Fs. The concentration of PCDD/Fs in particulates was correlated with chloride content, {{which is consistent with}} its positive effect on PCDD/F formation. This could be mitigated by pretreating the feedstock to remove chloride and metals. Mass balance indicated that cement kilns eliminated about 94 % of the PCDD/F TEQ input from the feedstock.

40|$|Intraslope lobe {{deposits}} {{provide a}} process {{record of the}} infill of accommodation on submarine slopes and their recognition enables the accurate reconstruction of the stratigraphic evolution of submarine slope systems. Extensive exposures of discrete sand-prone packages in Units D/E and E, Fort Brown Formation, Karoo Basin, South Africa, permit analysis of the sedimentology and stacking patterns of three intraslope lobe complexes and their palaeogeographic reconstruction via bed-scale analysis and physical correlation of key stratal surfaces. The sand-prone packages comprise tabular, aggradationally to slightly compensationally stacked lobe deposits with constituent facies associations that {{can be attributed to}} lobe axis, lobe off-axis, lobe-fringe and distal lobe-fringe environments. Locally, intraslope lobe deposits are incised by low aspect ratio channels that mark basinward progradation of the deepwater system. The origin of accommodation on the slope for lobe deposition is interpreted to be due to differential compaction or healing of scars from mass <b>wasting</b> processes. The <b>stacking</b> patterns and sedimentary facies arrangement identified in this study are distinct from those of more commonly recognized basin-floor lobe deposits, thereby enabling the establishment of recognition criteria for intraslope lobe deposits in other less well exposed and studied fine-grained systems. Compared to basin floor lobes, intraslope lobes are smaller in volume, influenced by higher degrees of confinement, and tend to show aggradational stacking patterns...|$|R

Thus starch extraction industry plays a significant part in changing potato from a vegetable into a member of main food crops including rice, wheat and maize. While large amount of waste residue has been generated in potato starch processing, which contains various of organic materials such as protein, carbohydrate, starch et al., and brings waste of raw materials and a negative result to the environment if this <b>waste</b> residue is <b>stacked</b> outside without any disposal. This review focus on analysis and comparing of efficiency, technical requirements, economic and environmental effect of current recycle technologies for waste residue in potato processing, including bio-gas production, protein feed production and extraction of pectin and dietary fiber. Which shows that bio-gas production may have the most brilliant prospect in this field. Further research may be established in industrialization of this bio-gas producing technology, which may also contribute to future mixed culture fermentation technology, an effective way for growing energy crisis. While the other and most ideal solution lies in cleaner production: fully using of potato in food production and no waste residue will be generated...|$|R
40|$|Two {{prototype}} {{systems for}} low-density Green is Clean (GIC) waste at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) {{have been in}} operation for three years at the Solid Waste Operation's (SWOs) non-destructive assay (NDA) building. The Waste Assay for Nonradioactive Disposal (WAND) and the High Efficiency Radiation Counters for Ultimate Low Emission Sensitivity (HERCULES) are used to verify the waste generator's acceptable knowledge (AK) that low-density waste is nonradioactive. GIC waste includes all non-regulated waste generated in radiological controlled areas (RCAs) that has been actively segregated as ''clean'' (i. e., nonradioactive) {{through the use of}} waste generator AK. GIC waste that is verified clean can be disposed of at the Los Alamos County Landfill. It is estimated that 50 - 90 % of the low-density room trash from RCAs at LANL might be free of contamination. To date, with pilot programs at five facilities at LANL, 3000 cubic feet of GIC waste has been verified clean by these two prototype systems. Both the WAND and HERCULES systems are highly sensitive measurement systems optimized to detect very small quantities of common LANL radionuclides. Both of the systems use a set of phoswich scintillation detectors in close proximity to the waste, which have the capability of detecting plutonium- 239 concentrations below 3 pCi per gram of low density waste. Both systems detect low-energy x-rays and a broad range of gamma rays (10 - 2000 keV), while the WAND system also detects high energy beta particles (> 100 keV). The WAND system consists of a bank of six shielded detectors which screen low density shredded <b>waste</b> or <b>stacked</b> sheets of paper moving under the detectors in a twelve inch swath on a conveyor belt. The WAND system was developed and tested at the Los Alamos Plutonium Facility in conjunction with instrument system designers from the Los Alamos Safeguards Science and Technology group. The HERCULES system consists of a bank of three shielded detectors which screen low-density waste in two cubic foot cardboard boxes or in bags sitting on a turntable. Waste that does not pass the verification process can be examined within the facility to determine the type and quantity of the contamination and its origin within a waste container. The paper discusses lessons learned that have helped generators improve their AK segregation...|$|R
40|$|Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and -furans (PCDFs) are {{ubiquitous}} in the environment. This paper estimates the present UK environmental loading of PCDD/Fs in soils, vegetation, air, water and sediments. Greater than 95 % {{of the estimated}} total PCDD/F loading of 5. 7 t in the UK environment is present in surface soils. Annual emissions from known primary sources of PCDDs and PCDFs are estimated. The {{most important of these}} include: municipal <b>waste</b> incinerator <b>stack</b> emissions (10. 9 kg ΣPCDD/F per annum); industrial (7. 7 kg/year) and domestic (5. 1 kg/year) combustion of coal; clinical waste incinerators (1. 7 kg/year); volatilization from chlorophenol-treated substrates (1. 7 kg/year) and combustion of leaded petrol by motor vehicles (0. 7 kg/year). These sources are generally easy to define and reasonably reliable national estimates can be obtained. More difficult to quantify are secondary releases from the large UK stock of pentachlorophenol (PCP) and PCP-treated products, which may represent quantitatively {{one of the most important}} sources of total PCDD/Fs to the environment. Estimates of homologue-specific emissions indicate that combustion processes represent a far more significant source of tetra and penta CDD/Fs than do chlorophenols, which in turn constitute a greater source of hepta- and octachlorinated congeners. Direct emission of PCDD/Fs into the atmosphere from combustion processes facilitates their atmospheric transport to remote locations. This, coupled with the diffuse nature of combustion processes, means that the effects of PCDD/F contamination originating from anthropogenic combustion are more widespread than those from the use and disposal of chlorophenols. Contamination from chlorophenols will be more localised, owing to the insignificance of direct atmospheric release pathways for this source. Although there is reasonable agreement between the estimated current annual flux and the present UK environmental loading of PCDDs and PCDFs, a large discrepancy exists between the sum of the annual contributions from primary sources and this annual flux. Whilst the existence of an as yet unidentified source or sources or gross underestimates of known sources cannot be excluded, it is proposed that much of this discrepancy may be accounted for by secondary releases from the use and disposal of chlorophenols and the long-range transport, continued remobilisation and subsequent redeposition of PCDDs and PCDFs already present in the environment. Despite limited evidence for a modest decline in levels of PCDDs and PCDFs in some environmental compartments over the last 20 years, the environmental persistence of these chemicals means that they will remain in the UK environment for the foreseeable future despite recent action to curb primary emissions...|$|R
