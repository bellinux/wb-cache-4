50|$|For {{both the}} {{practical}} application and {{scientific study of}} chalcogenide glasses, glass purity is of utmost importance. Varying levels of trace impurities, even at levels of a few parts per million can alter the spectroscopic behavior of a glass. Similarly, impurities are a major concern for optical components. Impurities in the raw materials and hence in the resulting glass, contribute {{to the loss of}} power through an optical component, whether it {{is in the form of}} a long glass fiber or an infrared window. These impurities contribute to the optical loss through absorption and scattering as well as serving as nucleation sites for crystallization.Although high purity raw elements are now commercially available, with 99.9999% purity routine for many metals, even this level of purity is often not sufficient, particularly for optical fiber applications.More of a concern are commercially available chalcogenide compounds such as germanium sulfide, gallium sulfide or arsenic sulfide. Although these may have been synthesized from high purity elements, the conversion process itself can readily introduce oxide, water or organic impurities. It is not unheard of to find for example, commercial gallium sulphide contaminated with 45% or more gallium oxide through incomplete reaction of the precursors during production.The conventional method for producing chalcogenide glasses is through the use of sealed ampoule melting. In this technique the required glass precursor materials are sealed under vacuum in a silica ampoule, melted, and then quenched to form a glass within the ampoule. The requirement for the sealed atmosphere is dictated by the volatile nature of many of the precursors which if melted in open atmosphere can result in large compositional changes or complete removal of components with low vapour pressures. This process also has the effect of trapping any impurities in the precursors within the glass as thus the precursor purity limitsthe ultimate quality of the glass that is produced. In addition, impurities can be transferred to the glass from the ampoule walls.The closed nature of the process leads to tightly controlled quality. In addition to the open and closed systems for glass melting,chalcogenide chemical vapour deposition is emerging as a method to produce high quality chalcogenide glass, in both thin film and bulk glass form. Gallium lanthanum sulfide glasses use essentially non-volatile components La2S3, La2O3 and Ga2S3 to form the basic glass with glass modifiers added as needed. This allows melting in an open atmosphere, under a flowing inert gas, typically argon. Batches of the compounds are prepared in a nitrogen-purged glovebox, placed in a vitreous carbon crucible and transferred to a silica tube furnace in a sealed vessel. Melting is typically at 1150 °C for 24 hours. The molten gallium sulfides fluxed the lanthanum compounds and incorporated them into the melt at temperatures much lower than their respective melting points. The viscosity of the melt is low enough, at approximately 1 poise to allow full mixing without the need for a rocking furnace which is required for melting in an ampoule. The melt is normally quenched to glass by pushing it into a <b>water</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>jacket.</b> An advantage of melting in an open atmosphere is the ability of volatile impurities to boil off and be carried away, a significant advantage over sealed systems. For example, no SH- impurity is observed in the absorption spectra of Ga-La-S glasses, compared to very significant quantities in sulphide glasses melted by the sealed ampoule technique.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to point out a methodology to determine the solid-liquid interface energy sigmaSL in ternary alloy systems, mainly the Al-Cu-Ag system, and to present {{the results of these}} experiments. The solid-liquid interface energy is of major importance during phase transformation, i. e. phase nucleation, crystal growth and the final grain structure. In addition to cooling rate and chemical diffusion this quantity governs the microstructural length scale of solidification morphologies. Therefore, the solid-liquid interface energy is an important parameter in many analytical and numerical solidification and ripening models. In phase field simulations for example beside the diffusion coefficient it defines the microstructure of the interlamellar spacing and the primary and dendritic spacing. The experimental determination of the solid-liquid interface energy is complex and extensive. For one component and binary alloys, literature provides only limited experimental data. For ternary and multicomponent alloys no values have been determined yet. One of the most common techniques for measuring the solid-liquid interface energy is to analyze the grain boundary groove in an applied temperature gradient. Based on the work of Prof. Hunt and co-workers a radial heat flow apparatus was constructed and assembled and in addition the experimental method was optimized and improved in order to measure the solidliquid interface energy more efficient. Because of its axial symmetry the apparatus permits to maintain a stable temperature gradient using a single heating along the axis of a cylindrical sample and <b>water</b> <b>cooled</b> <b>jacket</b> at the outside. First the radial heat flow apparatus is applied to reproduce previous results from literature. The solid-liquid interface energy is determined for an Al-Cu alloy with eutectic composition in order to test the reliability of the apparatus. Therefore a cylindrical volume is molten along the central axis of a cylindrical sample. A solid-liquid grain boundary forms between the central heating element and the cylindrical wall. The semi-solid sample is hold in a stable radial temperature gradient until a chemical equilibrium state has been reached and the interface energy, that is to be determined, is the only off equilibrium effect. After the equilibration process of the sample the shape of the cusps is conserved by rapid quenching. After metallographic preparation, the specimens are optically analyzed to determine the shape of the grain boundary grooves. Assuming that the liquid and the solid have the same thermal conductivities, the local undercooling is merely a function of the measured temperature gradient. If the solid and liquid phases have different thermal conductivities, the isotherms at the grain boundary groove cusps are deformed and the local undercooling has to be determined numerically with commercial finite volume software. The solid-liquid interface energy is obtained using the Gibbs-Thomson equation which requires the measuring of the local curvature of the grain boundary grooves, determining the local undercooling by heat flux simulations, and knowledge about the entropy of fusion. The values of literature could be reproduced whereat the reliability of the results could be improved by different optimizations and enhanced examination and analysis. Afterwards the experiments are extended to determine the solid-liquid interface energy for an alloy with an invariant eutectic composition in the ternary system Al-Cu-Ag for the first time. The solid-liquid interface energy is determined for the single phases Alpha, Theta und Zeta. Here the grain boundary grooves between grains of different phases may be deformed. This is caused by the deformation of the temperature field due to the different thermal conductivities of the solid phases and by the different solid-liquid interface energies respectively. The asymmetry will be considered by enhanced analysis of the grain boundary groove shapes. Considering the balance of forces at the triple point of the grain boundary grooves and providing isotropy the grain boundary energy sigmaGB can be determined after the solid-liquid interface energies sigmaSL are calculated. In order to describe the influence of the concentration on the solid-liquid interface energy further experiments are carried out for binary Al-Cu alloys adjacent to the Al-Cu alloy with eutectic composition. Furthermore the solid-liquid interface energy is measured for an Al-Cu-Ag alloy with monovariant composition in order to comprise the three phase area Alpha, Theta and Zeta of the Al-Cu-Ag system...|$|E

This new method allows to overcome the drawbacks identified in the former methodology, providing the ability to use the more advanced polyhedral mesh type to generate good quality grids in complex geometries like <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jackets,</b> and integrating all the different components of the engine cylinder in one unique multi-material mesh. In the method developed, these advantages can be used while optimizing the process to perform the simulations, and obtaining improved accuracy in the temperature field of engine components surrounding the <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket</b> when compared to the experimental data from Scania CV AB tests rigs. The present work exposes the limitations encountered within the former methodology and presents a theoretical background to explain the physics involved, describing the computational tools and procedures to solve these complex fluid and thermal problems in a practical and cost-effective way, by the use of CFD. A mesh sensitivity analysis performed during this study reveals that a mesh with low y+ values, close to 1 in the <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>jacket,</b> is needed to obtain an accurate temperature distribution along the cylinder head, as well as to accurately identify boiling regions in the coolant domain.

The results have generally been very promising and have shown the possibility of maintaining the same performance rating over the overall engine speed range as well as comparable emissions and brake specific fuel consumption in steady-state conditions. Furthermore, appreciably faster engine and aftertreatment warm-up have been recorded due to the higher heat fraction that is transferred to the coolant and to the more favorable exhaust gas enthalpy management.

Among the many competing numerical sub-models involved in the CFD simulations, particular attention is devoted to the modeling of phase transition and vapor nuclei formation within the coolant galleries. Concerning the FEM side, thermo-mechanical analyses are carried out aiming at addressing the design optimization of the engine in terms of fatigue strength. In view of the wide range of thermal and load conditions, both high-cycle and low-cycle fatigue must be properly characterized by means of ad-hoc criteria. An energy-based criterion specifically suited for low-cycle fatigue regions is therefore superimposed to well-established S-N o ε-N criteria for the high cycle fatigue regions. The proposed methodology shows very promising results in terms of point-wise detection of possible engine failures ans proves to be an effective tool for the accurate thermo-mechanical characterization of internal combustion engines under actual life-cycle operations...|$|R

The engine burns LOX-hydrogen propellants at a chamber pressure of 600 psia. Various transpiration coolant flow rates were tested with resultant local hot gas wall temperatures in the 800 F to 1400 F range. The feasibility of transpiration cooling with hydrogen and helium, {{and the use of}} photo-etched copper platelets for heat transfer and coolant metering was successfully demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to ascertain the condition of braze joints and <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> hardware from an accelerator section after prolonged use. Metallographic analysis was used to examine critical sites on an accelerator section that had been in use for more than 30 years. The end flange assembly showed no internal operational damage or external environmental effects. The cavity cylinder stack showed no internal operational damage however the internal surface was highly oxidized. The internal surface of the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> tubing was uniformly corroding at a rate of about 1 mil per year and showed no evidence of pitting. Tee fitting internal surfaces are corroding at non-uniform rates due to general corrosion and pitting. Remaining service life of the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>jacket</b> is estimated to be about 20 years or year 2027. At this time, water supply pressure will exceed allowable fitting pressure due to corrosion of tubing walls...|$|R

40|$|Different control {{strategies}} of bed temperature and moisture were investigated using various inlet air tem-peratures and air fluxes {{in both the}} ordinary packed bed bioreactor (without <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> in the <b>jacket)</b> and the bioreactor with <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> in <b>jacket.</b> The experi-ments were carried out within a 1 -L solid-state packed bed bioreactor in which Aspergillus niger was cultivat-ed on wheat bran. On-line measurements of oxygen quantity in the outlet air and temperature {{of the bed and}} the inlet air flux were carried out in both types of the bioreactors. Effects of certain control strategies on fungal growth rate were compared in both the bioreac-tors. According to experimental results, using the bioreactor with the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> in the <b>jacket</b> is a bet-ter strategy for control of bed temperature and mois-ture during packed bed solid state fermentation. Cumulative oxygen consumption in this bioreactor was approximately 1. 7 times higher than other control strategies used in this study...|$|R

50|$|In {{laboratory}} distillation, reflux, and rotary evaporators, {{several types}} of condensers are commonly used. The Liebig condenser is simply a straight tube within a <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> <b>jacket,</b> and is the simplest (and relatively least expensive) form of condenser. The Graham condenser is a spiral tube within a water jacket, and the Allihn condenser has a series of large and small constrictions on the inside tube, each increasing the surface area upon which the vapor constituents may condense. Being more complex shapes to manufacture, these latter types are also more expensive to purchase. These three types of condensers are laboratory glassware items since they are typically made of glass. Commercially available condensers usually are fitted with ground glass joints and come in standard lengths of 100, 200, and 400 mm. Air-cooled condensers are unjacketed, while water-cooled condensers contain a jacket for the water.|$|R
