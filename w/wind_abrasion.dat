40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first rock mass loss data for uncut clasts from continental Antarctica. A rock mass loss experiment using doleritic rock samples was conducted over a seven-year period, between 2008 and 2014, at the Vesleskarvet nunataks, Western Dronning Maud Land. The {{data show that}} approximately 10 % of clasts suffered a mass loss that is {{an order of magnitude}} greater than the remaining 90 % of clasts. Thus, the observed rock mass loss is suggested to occur in a series of events that are impossible to predict in terms of frequency and/or magnitude. However, extrapolating from the data obtained during the seven-year period indicates that rates of mass loss are slow and of the order of 1 % per 100 years. Direct erosion by <b>wind</b> (including <b>abrasion)</b> as well as mechanical and chemical weathering are suggested to be responsible for rock mass loss. Rock properties, the weathering environment, and a lack of available moisture may be contributing factors to the slow rate of rock decay.

40|$|Two {{sites on}} a playa (claypan) in south western Queensland, Australia {{were chosen to}} {{represent}} the variability in soil surface conditions known to control wind erosion and dust production in the region. The material was very fine and comprised of large amounts and different types of salts, high electrical conductivity, a propensity for slaking {{and the presence of}} cyanobacteria. The surfaces of 4 plots at each site were modified using in situ rainfall simulation and <b>wind</b> tunnel <b>abrasion.</b> The changes in the surface conditions were recorded using digital images and multi-angular spectral measurements of reflectance and inverted against a soil bi-directional spectral reflectance model. Optimised values of the model parameters produced the single scattering albedo (SSA) and a description of the scattering behaviour of the soil surfaces that included an estimate of microscopic roughness. The model parameters removed the effect of the measurement conditions (illumination and viewing geometry) on the spectral reflectance. Abrasion of the untreated surfaces demonstrated that the variability in the antecedent surface conditions {{played an important role in}} their response. Rainfall, drying and subsequent abrasion appeared to reset the soil surface conditions and controlled the spatial and temporal variation in the soil surface conditions. Redundancy analyses, conducted separately for SSA of selected wavebands, model parameter values and treatments elucidated the subtle and interactive effects of the treatments and surface responses. The results showed that high intensity rainfall and abrasion was associated with wavebands in the visible region and reduced roughness. Low intensity rainfall was associated with wavebands in the near-infrared and short-wave infrared regions and increased roughness. The analysis was interpreted as the result of eluviation due to rainsplash impact which caused size segregation and the preferential translocation of iron oxides to the surface and the creation of a thick surface seal and caused a thin crust which enabled the movement of salts and/or mineral clays to the surface because of the strong evaporation gradient. A poor relationship between aerodynamic resistance and microscopic roughness suggested that features of soil surface erodibility created by natural environmental processes such as rainsplash and wind erosion required a correction for macroscopic roughness. The values of the model parameters appeared to be insensitive to the directional nature of the abrasion process. The findings are significant for the development of this work towards an airborne or satellite-based assessment of soil surface erodibility and erosion. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|This review {{assesses the}} {{potential}} aeolian regime on Venus as derived from spacecraft observations, laboratory simulations, and theoretical considerations. The two requirements for aeolian processes (a supply of small, loose particles and winds of sufficient strength to move them) {{appear to be}} met on Venus. Venera 9, 10, 13, and 14 images show particles considered to be sand and silt size on the surface. In addition, dust spurts (grains 5 to 50 microns in diameter) observed via lander images and inferred from the Pioneer-Venus nephalometer experiments suggest that the particles are loose and subject to movement. Although data on near surface winds are limited, measurements of 0. 3 to 1. 2 m/sec from the Venera lander and Pioneer-Venus probes appear to be well within the range required for sand and dust entrainment. Aeolian activity involves {{the interaction of the}} atmosphere, lithosphere, and loose particles. Thus, there is the potential for various physical and chemical weathering processes that can effect not only rates of erosion, but changes in the composition of all three components. The Venus Simulator is an apparatus used to simulate weathering under venusian conditions at full pressure (to 112 bars) and temperature (to 800 K). In one series of tests, the physical modifications of windblown particles and rock targets were assessed and it was shown that particles become abraded even when moved by gentle <b>winds.</b> However, little <b>abrasion</b> occurs on the target faces. Thus, compositional signatures for target rocks may be more indicative of the windblown particles than of the bedrock. From these and other considerations, aeolian modifications of the venusian surface may be expected to occur as weathering, erosion, transportation, and deposition of surficial materials. Depending upon global and local wind regimes, there may be distinctive sources and sinks of windblown materials. Radar imaging, especially as potentially supplied via the Magellan mission, may enable the identification of such areas on Venus...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Diels (1897) {{first put}} forward a climatic {{hypothesis}} for the origin of divaricating plants. This hypothesis has been elaborated by subsequent authors and is further extended herein. In contrast, Greenwood and Atkinson (1977) proposed that the divaricating shrub form evolved as a protection against moa-browsing. These two hypotheses are critically compared and it is concluded that the climatic hypothesis better explains the ecology, distribution and morphology of divaricating plants. Divaricating plants are adapted to existing non-forest and forest margin habitats and {{it is suggested that}} they arose during the harsh, near-treeless glacial periods of the Pleistocene.

The saturated hydrocarbon fractions of the organic solvent extracts consist mainly of long-chain n-alkanes derived from epicuticular wax coatings of terrestrial plants. Backward trajectories for each sampling day and location were calculated using a global atmospheric circulation model. The main atmospheric transport {{took place in the}} low-level trade-wind layer, except in the southern region, where long-range transport in the mid-troposphere occurred. Changes in the chain length distributions of the n-alkane homologous series are probably related to aridity, rather than temperature or vegetation type. The carbon preference of the leaf-wax n-alkanes shows significant variation, attributed to a variable contribution of fossil fuel- or marine-derived lipids. The effect of this nonwax contribution on the 13 C values of the two dominant n-alkanes in the aerosols, n-C 29 and n-C 31 alkane, is, however, insignificant. Their 13 C values were translated into a percentage of C 4 vs. C 3 plant type contribution, using a two-component mixing equation with isotopic end-member values from the literature. The data indicate that only regions with a predominant C 4 type vegetation, i. e. the Sahara, the Sahel, and Gabon, supply C 4 plant-derived lipids to dust organic matter. The stable carbon isotopic compositions of leaf-wax lipids in aerosols mainly reflect the modern vegetation type along their transport pathway. <b>Wind</b> <b>abrasion</b> of wax particles from leaf surfaces, enhanced by a sandblasting effect, is most probably the dominant process of terrigenous lipid contribution to aerosols...|$|E
40|$|Estimation of {{the rate}} of aeolian {{abrasion}} of rocks on Mars requires knowledge of: (1) particle flux, (2) susceptibilities to abrasion of various rocks, and (3) wind frequencies on Mars. Fluxes and susceptibilities {{for a wide range}} of conditions were obtained in the laboratory and combined with wind data from the Viking meteorology experiment. Assuming an abundant supply of sand-sized particles, estimated rates range up to 2. 1 x 10 to the minus 2 power cm of abrasion per year in the vicinity of Viking Lander 1. This rate is orders of magnitude too great to be in agreement with the inferred age of the surface based on models of impact crater flux. The discrepancy in the estimated rate of abrasion and the presumed old age of the surface cannot be explained easily by changes in climate or exhumation of ancient surfaces. The primary reason is thought to be related to the agents of abrasion. At least some sand-sized (approx. 100 micrometers) grains appear to be present, as inferred from both lander and orbiter observations. High rates of abrasion occur for all experimental cases involving sands of quartz, basalt, or ash. However, previous studies have shown that sand is quickly comminuted to silt- and clay-sized grains in the martian aeolian regime. Experiments also show that these fine grains are electrostatically charged and bond together as sand-sized aggregates. Laboratory simulations of <b>wind</b> <b>abrasion</b> involving aggregates show that at impact velocities capable of destroying sand, aggregates from a protective veneer on the target surface and can give rise to extremely low abrasion rates...|$|E
40|$|Ventotene {{island is}} located {{in the eastern part of}} the Pontine Archipelago (Latium, Italy). Ventotene {{represents}} the south-eastern flank of a strato-volcano formed by the superimposition of deposits ejected during both effusive and explosive eruptions, over the last 800. 000 years of activity. As regards lithology, the Ventotene island may be subdivided into three sector: a lower part, mostly formed of lava deposits, which reaches its maximum thickness at the southern end of the island, at Capo Arco; an intermediate part, mostly pyroclastic, which forms the central part of the island, overlying the lava series; finally, the upper part, which forms the northern sector of the island, represented by reworked volcanic materials. The whole succession dips toward the NE, with its maximum thickness at Capo Arco, and its minimum at the level of the inhabited part of Ventotene. From a morphological standpoint, the island is characterized by the presence of a slightly dipping plateau, bordered by cliffs with height ranging between 130 m (in the southern sector) and 10 m (in the northern sector). The plateau surface is grooved with flat-bottomed valleys, formed along some the principal of the underlying tuff. The island is affected by a continuous activity of erosional and mass instability processes, caused by exogenous agents (sea wave action, <b>wind</b> <b>abrasion</b> and erosion due to runoff and infiltration water), that are at the origin of a long sequence of erosion and landslides. Even the island geological setup, the rock slide occur mostly along the entire perimeter of the island, in the tuff formation with fall, toppling and sliding mechanisms. The progressive evolution of the cliffs through such processes is heavily reducing the size of the island, at the same time threatening and causing damage to the precious cultural heritage of the Roman era. Considering the high coastal landslide risk and scarce economic resources, it is necessary to define automated procedures which, beginning with field data collected in sample areas, might identify area of highest risk. This article will, therefore, propose a quantitative method for the analysis of landslides based on the application of the Matheson test, implemented in a GIS environment. More specifically, we have developed a computational algorithm based on geomechanical surveys, carried out on different areas of the island for commercial purposes, and considering four failure mechanisms (planar sliding, wedge slip, flexural tipping and tilting block), which have enabled the elaboration of a landslide hazard map in stone formations of tuff cliffs on the island of Ventotene...|$|E
