5|$|Of the 127 {{bird species}} found along the Merced River, only 35 occur {{along the entire}} length of the river. Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few times every year, while 109 species of birds are found only in the {{breeding}} season. Birds are more abundant along the slow-moving lower river, which has more suitable riparian habitat compared to the rocky, swift upper river. Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby-crowned kinglet, cedar waxwing, American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, tree swallow and European starling, and several endangered species, including <b>white-tailed</b> <b>kite</b> and Swainson's hawk. Birds that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include mourning dove, Cassin's finch, California quail, dark-eyed junco, woodpecker, dipper, great blue heron, scrub jay, red-winged blackbird, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, cliff swallow, canyon wren, merganser, and bald eagles. Common insects found along the river include mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies. The river is impacted by invasive Asiatic clam, Chinese mitten crab, and New Zealand mud snail.|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "black-shouldered kite" [...] was {{formerly}} {{used for a}} Eurasian and African species, Elanus caeruleus, with the Australian species, Elanus axillaris, and the North American species, the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>kite</b> Elanus leucurus, treated as subspecies of this. These three Elanus species have comparable plumage patterns and sizes, however, they are now regarded as distinct, and the name black-winged kite is used for E. caeruleus.

40|$|I {{examined}} the diet of breeding <b>White-tailed</b> <b>Kites</b> (Elanus leucurus; Aves; Accipitridae) and Barn Owls (Tyto alba; Aves; Tytonidae) in an agrarian area of southern Brazil by analyzing regurgitated prey remains. The {{objective was to}} evaluate how these raptors, which differ markedly in their hunting activity periods (owls are nocturnal and kites diurnal), share their mammalian food component. 2, 087 prey consumed by Barn Owls and 1, 276 by <b>White-tailed</b> <b>Kites</b> were identified. They presented a high overlap of food-niches (Pianka’s index was 0. 98). Based on the daily activity period of their main small mammal prey, a lower overlap would be expected. The crepuscular/nocturnal Mus musculus was the main prey for the diet of breeding Barn Owls (81 %) and <b>White-tailed</b> <b>Kites</b> (63 %). This small exotic rodent provided 63 % of the small mammal biomass ingested by owls and 44 % by kites. Larger native small mammals were also considered important for the diet of kites, mainly because of their biomass contribution. Although these raptors differ markedly in their hunting activity periods, Barn Owls and <b>White-tailed</b> <b>Kites</b> are very similar predators in southern Brazil, overlapping their diets...|$|R
40|$|We {{inventoried}} terrestrial {{small mammals}} in an agricultural area in southern Brazil by using trapping and prey consumed by Barn Owls (Tyto alba) and <b>White-tailed</b> <b>Kites</b> (Elanus leucurus).

Ao todo, 1975 espécimes de pequenos mamíferos foram capturados com armadilhas, 2062 identificados a partir da dieta da suindara e 2066 da dieta do gavião-peneira. Juntas, as capturas com armadilhas e presas identificadas na dieta de ambos os predadores revelaram 18 espécies de pequenos mamíferos: três marsupiais (Didelphis albiventris, Gracilinanus -agilis e Monodelphis dimidiata) e 15 roedores (Akodon paranaensis, Bruceppatersonius iheringi, Calomys sp., Cavia -aperea, Euryzygomatomys spinosus, Holochilus brasiliensis, Mus musculus, Necromys lasiurus, Nectomys squamipes, Oligoryzomys nigripes, Oryzomys angouya, Oxymycterus sp. 1, Oxymycterus sp. 2, Rattus norvegicus e Rattus rattus).

50|$|Less {{well known}} are the {{extensive}} upland habitats {{found on the}} refuge. Many of these habitats are characterized by saline or alkaline conditions which are accentuated by the low rainfall and arid conditions that characterize the San Joaquin Valley. These habitats support a rich botanical community of native bunchgrasses, native and exotic annual grasses, forbs, and native shrubs. Trees, such as the valley oak, cottonwood, and willow are found along riparian corridors. In these areas, visitors might encounter coyotes, desert cottontails, ground squirrels, western meadowlarks, yellow-billed magpies, loggerhead shrikes, as well as northern harriers and <b>white-tailed</b> <b>kites</b> coursing over the vegetation and other raptors.

5|$|Predators {{of adult}} sparrows include house cats and small raptors like Cooper's and sharp-shinned hawks, American kestrels, and <b>white-tailed</b> <b>kites.</b> The nests may be raided by {{a range of}} species {{including}} mammals and reptiles such as snakes, though nest predation {{has not yet been}} directly observed, and nesting sparrows have been observed using three kinds of displays to distract potential predators; the rodent run, the broken wing, and the tumbling off the bush. Birds adopt a rodent run display to distract predators. The head, neck and tail are lowered, wings held out, and feathers fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call. In the broken wing display, the sparrow imitates having a broken wing by dropping one to the ground and hopping away from the nest with one wing dragging, leading the predator away until the bird ceases the act and escapes the predator. The adult rufous-crowned sparrow distracts a nest predator by falling from the top of a bush to attract the predator to itself in the tumbling off the bush display.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Wildlife Management, 1975 This thesis {{reports the}} results of a study on the time and {{activity}} patterns, ecological energetics, predatory efficiency, and caching behavior of American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) wintering in the vicinity of Arcata, Humboldt County, California. Several studies on the time and activity budgets of birds have been conducted in recent years. Most were conducted during the breeding season (Orians 1961, Verner 1965, Schartz and Zimmerman 1971, Verbeek 1972); only two (Pearson 1954, Verbeek 1964) involved wintering birds. The study reported here on the American Kestrel also was conducted during the winter. In this study I monitored the behavioral patterns of single birds not involved in reproductive activities. Some time and activity data were reported for <b>White-tailed</b> <b>Kites</b> (Elanus leucurus) (Stendell 1972, Bammann 1975) and breeding Kestrels (Balgooyen 1972). Ueoka (1974) quantified the time and activity patterns of predatory behavior of Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) in relation to the breeding season. Levenson (in progress) is studying the time and activity patterns of Ospreys at their nests. Schnell (1967) studied the influence of environmental conditions on the incidence of flight in Rough-legged Hawks (Buteo lagopus). The energy expenditure of raptorial birds in the field has been estimated only for the Snowy Owl (Nyctea scandiaca) (Gessaman 1972). Gessaman (1973) is currently conducting laboratory research which, when perfected, will provide a sophisticated energy budget for the American Kestrel. In the present study, the energy expenditure of Kestrels was predicted following deterministic models developed by Koplin (1972, and in prep.). The predicted energy expenditure was compared with observed caloric intake as a means of testing the valid-' ity of the deterministic model. The efficiency of predators in obtaining prey recently has interested field biologists. The predatory efficiency of Kestrels was studied during the non-breeding season in Costa Rica (Jenkins 1970) and in Michigan (Sparrowe 1972), and during the breeding season in Califor-nia (Balgooyen 1972). Ueoka (1974) reviewed the literature on hunting efficiency of birds and mammals and presented data on the hunting efficiency of Ospreys. Additional studies concerned with hunting efficiency were conducted on <b>White-tailed</b> <b>Kites</b> (Stendell 1972, Bammann 1975), Snowy Owls (Rohn 1974) and several non-raptorial birds (Orians 1969, Dunn 1972, Recher and Recher 1972, Dinsmore 1973, Schlorff in progress). Prey caching has been documented for many raptors. Among falcon - iforms, prey caching has been reported in American Kestrels (Pierce 1937, Tordoff 1955, Roest 1957, Stendell and Waian 1968, Balgooyen 1972, Mueller 1974), Merlins (Falco columbarius) (Greaves 1968), and Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) (Schnell 1958, Gullion 1965). Prey caching also has been observed in many owls (Allen 1924, Lockley 1938, Wallace 1948, Raber 1950, Mossman 1955, Jansson 1964, Norburg 1964, Grant 1965, Ligon 1968, Catling 1972) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{island is}} known for being {{possibly}} the most important breeding area for the aquatic warbler. OTOP, the Polish Society for the Protection of Birds bought 1.8 square kilometres of the island. The whole island covers some 3 km2 {{and is the only}} reserve owned by OTOP. The number of aquatic warblers on the island depends on the water level and the available vegetation. There were between 55 singing males in the late 1990s. The island consists of large meadows, pastures, and it has large reed beds. Numerous other breeding birds include: marsh and Montagu's harriers, Eurasian curlew, common redshank and bearded tit. Other species include <b>white-tailed</b> eagle, black <b>kite</b> and lesser spotted eagle. On passage there are numerous flocks of geese, waterfowl, cranes and waders. The other forms of wildlife include wild boar and occasionally otter. The site is frequented by birders and is placed ideally for those driving to Poland via Germany.|$|R

50|$|For {{some recent}} decades, it was lumped with the black-winged kite of Europe and Africa as Elanus caeruleus and was collectively called black-shouldered kite. More {{recently}} it was {{argued that the}} <b>white-tailed</b> <b>kite</b> differed from the Old World species in size, shape, plumage, and behavior, and that these differences were sufficient to warrant full species status. This argument was accepted by the American Ornithologists' Union, so the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>kite</b> was returned to its original name. Meanwhile, the Old World E. caeruleus is once again called black-winged kite, while the name black-shouldered kite is now reserved for an Australian species, Elanus axillaris, which had also been lumped into E. caeruleus but is now regarded as separate again.|$|E
50|$|The area {{is rich in}} wildlife; {{among the}} species likely to be seen are California mule deer, coyote, California vole, <b>white-tailed</b> <b>kite,</b> American kestrel, band-tailed pigeon and California quail.

50|$|The {{black-winged kite}} (Elanus caeruleus) {{is a small}} diurnal bird of prey in the family Accipitridae {{best known for its}} habit of {{hovering}} over open grasslands in the manner of the much smaller kestrels. This Eurasian and African species was sometimes combined with the Australian black-shouldered kite (Elanus axillaris) and the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>kite</b> (Elanus leucurus) of North and South America which together form a superspecies. This kite is distinctive, with long-wings, white, grey and black plumage and owl like forward-facing eyes with red irises. Although mainly seen on the plains, they are sometimes seen on grassy slopes of hills in the higher elevation regions of Asia. They are not migratory, but make short-distance movements in response to weather.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>white-tailed</b> <b>kite</b> was {{rendered}} almost {{extinct in}} California in the 1930s and 1940s due to shooting and egg-collecting, {{but they are}} now common again. Their distribution is patchy, however. They {{can be found in}} the Central Valley and southern coastal areas, open land around Goleta including the Ellwood Mesa Open Space, marshes in Humboldt County, and also around the San Francisco Bay. Elsewhere, they are still rare or absent. They are also found in southern Texas, on the Baja California Peninsula, and in eastern Mexico. Globally, they are not considered threatened species by the IUCN. On rare occasions the bird can be found far outside its usual range. At different times, two had been sighted in New England as of 2010.|$|E
50|$|The animal {{population}} {{is pretty much}} {{the same as it was}} 10,000 years ago. Grizzly bears are an exception, as they were killed off by early Mexican and Spanish settlers. The most common medium and large-sized mammals are coyotes, mule deer, bobcats, raccoons, and skunks. Just away from the urban edge, other predators, such as grey fox, mountain lion, American badger, long-tailed weasel, and ringtailed cat, occupy various niches. The ecosystem's top predator, the mountain lion, is present everywhere except the fragmented eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains that bisects the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Because they fear humans, however, they are rarely seen. Also, there are numerous prey species—such as rabbits, squirrels, rats, mice, and other rodents. Seven species of hawks, eight species of owls, peregrine falcons, golden eagles, northern harriers, American kestrels, and <b>white-tailed</b> <b>kite</b> share in this bounty of prey.|$|E
