50|$|Albumen {{is both a}} {{thickening}} and a {{fixing agent}} for insoluble pigments. Chrome yellow, the ochres, vermilion and ultramarine are such pigments. Albumen is always dissolved in the cold, a process that takes several days when large quantities are required. Egg albumen is expensive and only used for the lightest shades. Blood albumen solution is used in cases when very dark colours are required to be absolutely fast to <b>washing.</b> <b>After</b> <b>printing,</b> albumen thickened colours are exposed to hot steam, which coagulates the albumen and effectually fixes the colours.|$|E
5000|$|Plastisol inks are not water-soluble. The ink is {{composed}} of PVC particles suspended in a [...] emulsion, and will not dry if left in the screen for extended periods. Because of the convenience of not needing to <b>wash</b> a screen <b>after</b> <b>printing,</b> plastisol inks can be used without a source of running water. Plastisol inks are recommended for printing on colored fabric. On lighter fabric, plastisol is extremely opaque and can retain a bright image for many years with proper care.|$|R

The discussion of mayim acharonim, <b>washing</b> <b>after</b> meals, contains a suggestion that <b>washing</b> <b>after</b> meals, as a health measure, is the more important of the two washings, on grounds that the salt used as a preservative in food could cause blindness if the eyes were rubbed without washing.|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{emergence}} of smart textiles and wearable textile systems, the need for electrically conductive textiles has become increasingly clear. Often this conductivity is achieved by integrating metal particles, fibres or yarns into textiles or by coating a textile with a metallic layer. In this research, the potential of another method is explored, namely screen printing a textile with conductive ink. This printing technique is an interesting alternative because it is flexible and cost effective. In this study the conductivity was investigated by measuring the square resistance at different stages (i. e. <b>after</b> <b>printing,</b> abrading and <b>washing,</b> respectively). The printed textiles studied herein exhibit good electrical properties <b>after</b> <b>printing</b> and abrading, respectively. However, <b>after</b> twenty <b>washing</b> cycles, the conductivity decreased considerably. Therefore, in order to improve washability, a protective polyurethane layer was put on top of the printed samples, which resulted in the good conductivity of the fabrics, even <b>after</b> <b>washing...</b>|$|R
