40|$|In this study, commercially {{produced}} malts {{were used}} for small-scale simulated mashing trials to investigate the impact of differences in the level and thermostability of malt diastatic power (DP) enzymes on the resultant <b>wort</b> <b>fermentability.</b> A modified European Brewery Convention/American Society Brewing Chemists mashing protocol was used with mash-in temperatures ranging between 45 and 76 °C for full-malt and 30 % rice adjunct mashes. Malt extract yield varied little with mashing temperature for most varieties in this temperature range. However, the fermentability, maltose content, and free amino nitrogen of that extract was considerably affected by mashing temperature with 65 °C achieving the highest fermentability for all malt varieties. Multilinear regression analysis of full-malt and rice adjunct mashing trials at 65 °C using 43 commercial malts showed {{that the level of}} alpha-amylase and total limit dextrinase activity, Kolbach Index, and the total beta-amylase activity level and thermostability were the most important malt quality predictors of <b>wort</b> <b>fermentability.</b> These conclusions suggest that the conventional DP assessment could be replaced with the measurement of its component enzymes outlined above so that maltsters could better satisfy brewers malt quality expectations by blending and defining their malt quality in terms of these fermentability predicting factors. This information would be particularly useful to brewers who brew with multiple varieties and blends from different suppliers. The focus on individual enzyme characteristics by barley breeders is likely to provide selection targets that are more accurate and achievable...|$|E
40|$|Factors {{that affect}} <b>wort</b> <b>fermentability</b> were {{investigated}} with 180 doubled haploid lines from an Arapiles/Franklin cross. Barley, grown in South Australia during 2001, was micromalted and analysed using standard methods. Samples {{were found to}} have a wide range in malting quality with lines both superior and inferior to the parents for all traits analysed. QTL and statistical analysis of data indicated, for this population, that poor malt modification, beta-glucan in particular, had the greatest negative effect on fermentability. Fermentability was also negatively correlated with the maltotetrose content of wort. A significant QTL for this sugar was coincident with the chromosome 4 H locus for the heat-stable beta-amylase (sd 2 H). Lines with the heat stable enzyme, inherited from Arapiles, had improved fermentabilities of IOB extracts but not of EBC extracts. Glucose, possibly coming from beta-glucan hydrolysis, was found to {{have a positive effect on}} fermentability. A significant QTL for wort fructose was in the area of the sdw semi-dwarfing gene on chromosome 3 H, highlighting the potential impact of agronomic traits on the genetic analysis of malt quality...|$|E
40|$|High-gravity brewing, {{which can}} {{decrease}} production costs by increasing brewery yields, {{has become an}} attractive alternative to traditional brewing methods. However, as higher sugar concentration is required, the yeast is exposed to various stresses during fermentation. We evaluated the influence of high-gravity brewing on the fermentation performance of the brewer’s yeast under model brewing conditions. The lager brewer’s strain Weihenstephan 34 / 70 strain was characterized at three different gravities by adding either glucose or maltose syrups to the basic wort. We observed that increased gravity resulted in a lower specific growth rate, a longer lag phase before initiation of ethanol production, incomplete sugar utilization, {{and an increase in}} the concentrations of ethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate in the final beer. Increasing the gravity by adding maltose syrup as opposed to glucose syrup resulted in more balanced fermentation performance in terms of higher cell numbers, respectively, higher <b>wort</b> <b>fermentability</b> and a more favorable flavor profile of the final beer. Our study underlines the effects of the various stress factors on brewer’s yeast metabolism and the influence of the type of sugar syrups on the fermentation performance and the flavor profile of the final beer...|$|E
40|$|The brewing {{industry}} has devoted much research effort into {{the development of}} new technologies and innovations for the expansion of the assortment of specialty beers in response to increased consumer demand. Two types of specialty beers are of particular interest: low-carbohydrates beer and novel-flavoured beer. The selected beer types are technologically challenging to produce relative to the traditional approach of ingredient addition, yet offer special appeal to consumers from the perspective of health and flavour. This work aims at the enhancement of alternative yeast sources for the production of low-carbohydrates beer and novel-flavoured beer, through the study of the brewing characteristics of the same with lab scale microfermentation tests and brewing process on pilot plant with different fermenting conditions. The yeast strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae used for the initial screening were chosen from the Collection of Industrial Yeasts DBVPG of the University of Perugia. The microfermentation tests were carried out at 20 °C for seven days in standard barley malt wort at 12 °P with a yeast inoculum of 5 x 105. In order to assess the behavior of the yeast strains in these conditions we made gravimetric measurements for the ethanol production and plate count for the vitality and growth rate. The pilot-scale fermentations were performed at the Italian Brewing Research Center (CERB) of the University of Perugia. 25 L of wort was inoculated with the yeast strains that have shown the best evidence of the microfermentation tests. The study of the selected yeast strain behavior was conducted in various fermentation conditions: different wort density (12 - 20 °P) and different fermentation temperature (18 - 25 °C). The yeast strain selected for scaling up is DBVPG 6580 because it has shown a better adaptation to the wort in terms of vitality to the seventh day of fermentation at 20 °C (Log 7. 34), growth rate between the first and the seventh day of fermentation at 20 °C (Δ Log 1. 83) and production of alcohol (Alc Vol 5. 4 % ± 0. 3). In the best trial the results of sugar profiles of the bottle conditioned beers highlight the amylolytic power of the yeast strain DBVPG 6580 to produce beers with 0. 77 ± 0. 1 g L- 1 of total sugars. Moreover, the volatile compounds produced by yeast strain DBVPG 6580 exceed the perception threshold making beers rich in banana and fruits aroma (isoamyl acetate 2. 4 ± 0. 08 mg L- 1, ethyl hexanoate 0. 43 ± 0. 01 mg L- 1, ethyl acetate 77. 82 ± 7. 81 mg L- 1 and ethyl butyrate 0. 5 ± 0. 01 mg L- 1). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain DBVPG 6580 is an important resource for obtaining low-carbohydrates beers and/or beers with a marked fruity volatile profile. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain DBVPG 6580 is a traditional alternative to the use of exogenous enzymes, engineered yeast strains with amylolytic power, simple sugars to produce <b>worts</b> of increased <b>fermentability</b> and fruits or aromatic compoundsstatus: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{germination}} {{time and temperature}} {{on the quality of}} rye malt and worts derived thereof were investigated using Response Surface Methodology. Amylolytic and proteolytic enzyme activities were increased by long germination periods, while beta-glucanase activity was not influenced. Total and Soluble Nitrogen content were also not significantly affected by the variations in germination conditions. Free Amino Nitrogen (FAN) was found in higher amounts in worts prepared from rye malts with long germination times. Extract contents were higher in rye malt than in the control barley malt and could be increased by a favourable germination regime, while no such impact on <b>wort</b> <b>fermentability</b> was found. High wort viscosities could be significantly reduced by a long germination period at low temperatures, but were still unacceptably high. The same conditions favoured the development of endoxylanase activity. Arabinoxylan (AX) accumulated during the germination process and their extractability increased. The results suggest that longer germination periods resulted in an increased number of AX molecules with lower molecular mass. Optimal rye malt qualities within the limits of this study were found for a germination time of 144 h at 10 degrees C, which resulted in an acceptable FAN content and the lowest measured viscosity.

40|$|Diastatic power (DP), {{a measure}} of the level of {{activity}} of starch-hydrolyzing enzymes, is a term that refers to the combined activity levels of beta-amylase, alpha-amylase, limit dextrinase, and alpha-glucosidase. The result of the action of these enzymes during brewing is to break down starch into component sugars that are readily fermented into alcohol by yeast. Although DP is a reasonable predictor of fermentability, it does not always accurately estimate the level of fermentable sugars generated during mashing or the subsequent fermentability of the resultant wort. Previously, {{it has been shown that}} allelic variation in beta-amylase thermostability has a significant impact on <b>wort</b> <b>fermentability.</b> The thermostability of the DP enzymes is critical in determining fermentable sugar yield during mashing, where the mash temperature profile is a balance between the temperature required for starch gelatinization to enable efficient hydrolysis and the rate of thermal inactivation of the DP enzymes. This study demonstrates that there is significant variation in the thermostability of alpha-amylase and limit dextrinase in malts made from a wide range of Australian and international malting barley varieties. This variation in alpha-amylase and limit dextrinase thermostability combined with that of beta-amylase provides an opportunity for barley breeders to produce divergent malting varieties that better fulfill brewers’ fermentability requirements. The implications of the varying DP enzyme thermostability on the selection of malt by brewers to optimally suit different brewing styles and regimens are outlined...|$|E
40|$|Prediction of malt {{fermentability}} (apparent attenuation limit — AAL) by {{measurement of}} the diastatic power enzymes (DPE), α-amylase, total limit dextrinase, total β-amylase, β-amylase thermostability, and the Kolbach index (KI or free amino nitrogen — FAN) is superior to the conventional use of diastatic power (DP) alone. The thermostability of β-amylase {{is known to be}} an important factor in determining fermentability, thus the thermostability of the other relatively thermolabile enzyme, limit dextrinase, was investigated to determine if it was also useful in predicting fermentability. To facilitate this aim, methods were developed for a rapid and cost efficient assay of both β-amylase and limit dextrinase thermostability. Internationally important Australian and international malting varieties were compared for their total limit dextrinase and β-amylase activity and thermostability. Interestingly, the level of limit dextrinase thermostability was observed to be inversely correlated with total limit dextrinase activity. The prediction of malt fermentability was achieved by both forward step-wise multi-linear regression (MLR) and the partial least squares (PLS) multivariate model development methods. Both methods produced similar identifications of the parameters predicting <b>wort</b> <b>fermentability</b> at similar levels of predictive power. Both models were substantially better at predicting fermentability than the traditional use of DP on its own. The emphasis of this study was on the identification of predictive factors that can be consistently used in models to predict fermentability, because the model parameter estimates will subtly vary depending on mashing conditions, yeast strain/fermentation conditions and malt source. The application of these multivariate model development methods (PLS and MLR) enabled the identification of further potential fermentability predicting factors. The analyses divided the predictive parameters into those defined by DP enzymes and those associated with modification (KI, FAN, fine/coarse difference, wort β-glucan and friability). Surprisingly, limit dextrinase thermostability was not a substantial predictor of fermentability, presumably due to its negative correlation with total limit dextrinase activity. The application of these insights in the malting and brewing industries is expected to result in substantial improvements in brewing consistency and enable more specific quality targets for barley breeder's progeny selection cut-off limits to be more precisely defined...|$|E
