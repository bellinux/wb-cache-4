There were also some lyrics alluding to former N.W.A rapper Ice Cube, who departed acrimoniously from the group in 1989 and ridiculed Dre on the track [...] "No Vaseline", off his 1991 Death Certificate album. The lyrics: [...] "Then <b>we</b> <b>gon</b> creep <b>to</b> South Central, On a Street Knowledge mission, as I steps in the temple, Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap, Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat, You tryin to check my homey, you best check yo self, Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself" [...] had references to Cube's production operation Street Knowledge Productions (now Lench Mob Records), the lyrics [...] "steps in the temple" [...] referring to Ice Cube's affiliation with the Nation of Islam and his hit single [...] "Check Yo Self" [...] from third album The Predator. However, by the album's release, Ice Cube was on friendlier terms with Dr. Dre, even having a cameo appearance in [...] "Let Me Ride", so unlike Eazy-E and Luke, he was not parodied in the music video.|$|R

40|$|Particles of {{adenovirus}} type 2 (ad 2), when disassembled, consistently yield groups-of-nine (GON) hexons, {{which are}} the major virion shell component. The location of a minor component (6 %) of the GON has been determined using a novel combination of electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography. The Brookhaven Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (STEM) was used to estimate the distribution of protein in the <b>GON</b> <b>to</b> a resolution of 15 - 18 A. The relative hexon positions then were determined to within 1 A using {{a model of the}} hexon derived from the X-ray crystal structure to search the STEM image. The difference image between the STEM image and a model hexon group reveals individual monomers of polypeptide IX extending along the hexon [...] hexon interfaces. The distribution confirms our earlier proposal that four trimers of polypeptide IX are embedded in the large cavities in the upper surface of the <b>GON</b> <b>to</b> cement hexons into a highly-stable assembly...|$|R
40|$|Background: The greater {{occipital}} nerve (GON) block {{has been}} frequently used for {{different types of}} headache, but performed with rough estimates of anatomic landmarks. Our study presents {{the values of the}} anatomic parameters and estimates the effectiveness of the ultrasound-guided GON blockade. Methods: The GON was detected using ultrasound technique and distance from external occipital protuberance (EOP) <b>to</b> <b>GON,</b> from <b>GON</b> <b>to</b> occipital artery and depth from skin <b>to</b> <b>GON</b> was measured in volunteers. Patients with occipital headache were divided into two groups (ultrasound-guided block: group S, conventional blind block: group B) and GON block was performed. The same parameters were measured on group S and VAS scores were assessed at pretreatment, 1 week and 4 weeks after treatment on both groups. Results: The GON had distance of 23. 1 ± 3. 4 mm (right) and 20. 5 ± 2. 8 mm (left) from EOP <b>to</b> <b>GON.</b> Its depth below the skin was 6. 8 ± 1. 5 mm (right) and 7. 0 ± 1. 3 mm (left). The distance from <b>GON</b> <b>to</b> occipital artery was 1. 5 ± 0. 6 mm (right) and 1. 2 ± 0. 6 mm (left) in volunteers. Initial VAS score of group S and group B patients were 6. 4 ± 0. 2 and 6. 5 ± 0. 2. VAS score of 4 weeks after injection were 2. 3 ± 0. 2 on group S and 3. 8 ± 0. 3 on group B (P = 0. 0003). Conclusions: The parameters measured in this study should be useful for GON block and ultrasound-guided blockade {{is likely to be a}} more effective technique than blind blockade in occipital headache treatment.

60|$|Well, it {{happened}} {{one day that}} these two, when out for an evening stroll, met under a cherry tree, and in one moment fell {{madly in love with}} each other. Gon had long felt {{that it was time for}} him to find a wife, for all the ladies in the neighbourhood paid him so much attention that it made him quite shy; but he was not easy to please, and did not care about any of them. Now, before he had time to think, Cupid had entangled him in his net, and he was filled with love towards Koma. She fully returned his passion, but, like a woman, she saw the difficulties in the way, and consulted sadly with <b>Gon</b> as <b>to</b> the means of overcoming them. Gon entreated his master to set matters right by buying Koma, but her mistress would not part from her. Then the music master was asked <b>to</b> sell <b>Gon</b> <b>to</b> the lady, but he declined to listen to any such suggestion, so everything remained as before.|$|R

5000|$|According to the Mexican authorities, Ye Gon's {{money is}} the product of drug-trafficking activities.
