5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E

A leaking cylinder could issue a telltale <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> gas that, if spotted, would be sure to attract shellfire.|$|E

That was the {{remarkable}} part of this afternoon of sensations...one would not expect him to run through a first-class side of batsman, yet here was {{his name on the}} board with three Test batsman to his credit at a very small cost and at a very vital stage of the game.

25|$|Covered by {{only four}} riflemen, he fought {{for four hours}} under terrific enemy small-arms fire and {{repeatedly}} returned to his own lines to prepare demolition charges and obtain serviced flame throwers. He returned to the front, frequently {{to the rear of}} hostile emplacements, to wipe out one position after another. At one point, a <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> smoke alerted him to the air vent of a Japanese bunker, and he approached close enough to put the nozzle of his flamethrower through the hole, killing the occupants. On another occasion, he was charged by enemy riflemen who attempted to stop him with bayonets and he killed them with a burst of flame from his weapon.|$|E

In the spring of 1980 he took the role of David Bliss alongside Constance Cummings—as Judith Bliss—in a production of Noël Coward's 1920s play Hay Fever. Writing for The Observer, Robert Cushman thought that Le Mesurier played the role with [...] "deeply grizzled torpor", while Michael Billington, reviewing for The Guardian, saw him as a [...] "grey, gentle <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> a man, full of half-completed gestures and seraphic smiles".|$|E
500|$|To {{demonstrate}} that the character is not perfect, Woolverton described [...] "a little <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> hair that keeps falling in her face," [...] which was the only direction she used to describe Belle's physical appearance. Wanting Belle to be significantly different and more European in appearance than Ariel, the animators drew her with fuller lips, narrower eyes and darker eyebrows, which were inspired by the facial features of British actresses Vivien Leigh and Audrey Hepburn. More statuesque than most Disney princesses, Belle's appearance was inspired by that of American actress Jennie Garth. The animators also used photographs of Hollywood actresses Natalie Wood, Elizabeth Taylor and Grace Kelly for reference. Baxter studied the art of French impressionist Edgar Degas, a painter known for his portraits of ballerinas, whose work inspired the animator to incorporate [...] "graceful, swan-like movements" [...] into Belle's performance.|$|E

Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that the score [...] "is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered, [...] there's enough variety. ...

[...] He concluded that [...] "American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains {{little more than an}} annotated rock concert. ... Still, [...] deserves at least two cheers – for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway." [...] Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote [...] "Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won’t know what hit you. American Idiot knows no limits—it's a global knockout." [...] The musical has been nominated for three Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design.

500|$|Isherwood's {{review for}} the Broadway {{production}} was enthusiastic. He called the show [...] "a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions... only to transcend {{them through the}} power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I’ve seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past." [...] Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that [...] "the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated". Michael Kuchwara of the Associated Press found the show to be [...] "visually striking [...] musically adventurous", but noted that [...] "the show has the barest <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> a story and minimal character development".

[...] He concluded that songs like [...] "I Miss You" [...] and [...] "Start Over" [...] would earn deserved spots in [...] "the Beyoncé pantheon" [...] once fans take the time to grow attached to them. Andrew Unterberger of PopCrush praised the way Beyoncé delivers the line [...] "Why is that?", writing that it is [...] "a nice little nod to the confusion of heartbreak, and a rare, welcome glimpse of vulnerability for an artist who too often seems to have all of the answers." [...] Referring to [...] "I Miss You", Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that [...] "the 80s influence is not always a bad thing." [...] He considered the song to be [...] "a woozy update of an old-fashioned slow jam", further stating that [...] "it is probably pushing it a bit to call it an R equivalent of Ariel Pink's hypnagogic pop, but there's something enveloping and dream-like about it." [...] Ian Walker of AbsolutePunk commented that [...] " [...] hollow beat and dismal synthesizers, allow Beyoncé and her morosely beautiful voice center stage. [...] Beyoncé delivers a believable performance effortlessly." [...] By contrast, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune was negative, writing that [...] " [...] easily overlooked with its forlorn keyboard and beat-box chintziness." [...] Similarly, Consequence of Sound writer Chris Coplan felt that the ballad is [...] "too-saccharine-for-its-own-good."

500|$|There was a Ceklin zduhać {{who was so}} {{beaten by}} other zduhaći {{that he had to}} die, and there he was, dying. Various {{remedies}} were brought to him, but he accepted none, because all was in vain. Finally he had everybody ushered out of his house, except for one of his brothers, a famous hero; all were also driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said to his brother: [...] "I will surely die, if I am not substituted for; and you can do it and save me, if you will have enough strength." [...] The brother, of course, promised that, and the sick man continued: [...] "You will have to go tonight to Mount So-and-so, at three to four hours' walking distance from here, most of the way lying through a dense forest. You will come beneath a stair-like cliff and stop there, and a great fear will seize you. To encourage yourself, take your two pistols and a knife with the silver sheath." [...] "I will also take a musket," [...] added the brother, and the sick man said, [...] "You may take that too, though only as an encouragement, as it will be of no use to you, but you must have the knife." [...] "I can go without any weapon, with a pocket knife, if it is against a single, and with a weapon I can go against a hundred," [...] interrupted the brother again. [...] "Take it easy with your boldness," [...] resumed the sick man, [...] "and by all means take the knife. When you come beneath the cliff, the sky will be cloudless, lit, {{and there will be a}} silence in the air; then you will notice a <b>wisp</b> <b>of</b> cloud coming from the direction of Mount Rumija, and the wind will start to blow. The wisp will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and there will come a darkness such as you have never seen before; the wind will blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before; the hair will rise on your head so that it will lift your cap, and I fear that you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls falling down from the cloud on the earth: a light-haired, a pied, and a dark-haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls with the knife; but take care not to cut the light-haired bull; that would be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light-haired bull." ...|$|E
