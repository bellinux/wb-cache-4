5|$|The joke {{became an}} {{international}} sensation when publications from Europe, Hong Kong {{and other countries}} reprinted the trick without verifying it or asking EGMs permission. A Hong Kong comic based on Street Fighter II by Jademan Comics altered their story to include the character.

Square Enix has released six Ultimania guides and one bonus book on the Kingdom Hearts series exclusively in Japan. The Ultimania guides primarily serve as strategy guides for their respective games, revealing secrets from the developers' perspective.

5|$|After the {{critical}} and commercial success of Awakening, development began on Fates, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> of Awakening {{returning to their}} previous roles. The team's main concern was adding new features and refinements to the original gameplay, and improving the story, which had received criticism from fans. To this end, writer Shin Kibayashi was brought in. To show {{all sides of the}} story and provide players with different Fire Emblem experiences, the game was split up into multiple versions. Upon release, it met with highly positive reviews: Birthright was generally seen as a good starting place for new players, Conquest was praised for its challenge, while Revelation was noted as a good middle ground between the two releases.|$|E

When the black singer Marian Anderson was denied {{the use of}} Washington's Constitution Hall by the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1939, Eleanor resigned from the group in protest and helped arrange another concert {{on the steps of}} the Lincoln Memorial. Roosevelt later presented Anderson to the King and Queen of the United Kingdom after Anderson performed at a White House dinner. Roosevelt also arranged the appointment of African-American educator Mary McLeod Bethune, with whom she had struck up a friendship, as Director of the Division of Negro Affairs of the National Youth Administration. To avoid problems <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> when Bethune would visit the White House, Eleanor would meet her at the gate, embrace her, and walk in with her arm-in-arm.|$|E

5|$|To replace Jagodzinski, DeFillippo {{promoted}} Boston College {{defensive coordinator}} Frank Spaziani, who previously {{served as the}} Boston College head coach on an interim basis in 2006. Boston College offensive coordinator Steve Logan, who was unhappy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> changes on the football team, resigned shortly after Spaziani's promotion. To replace Logan, Spaziani hired former Navy head coach Gary Tranquill as Boston College's new offensive coordinator. One week after Logan's announcement, the Eagles' offensive line coach, Jack Bicknell, Jr., also {{announced that he was}} leaving the team. On January 27, special teams and tight ends coach Don Yanowsky announced his resignation from the Eagles, making him the fourth coach to be fired or resign from the Boston College football team after the season.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Phleps was serving <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> of the 32nd Infantry Division in Budapest. The division {{was involved in the}} early stages of the Serbian campaign, during which Phleps was transferred to the operations staff of the Second Army. The Second Army was soon withdrawn from the Serbian front and deployed via the Carpathian Mountains to the Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia (modern-day Poland and Ukraine) to defend against a successful offensive by the Russian Empire. The Second Army continued to fight the Russians in and around the Carpathians through the winter of 1914–1915. In 1915 Phleps was again transferred, this time to Armeegruppe Rohr commanded by General der Kavallerie (General) Franz Rohr von Denta, which was formed in the Austrian Alps in response to the Italian declaration of war in May 1915. Armeegruppe Rohr became the basis for the formation of the 10th Army, which was headquartered in Villach. Phleps subsequently became the deputy quartermaster of the 10th Army, responsible for organising the supply of the troops fighting the Italians in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Clark was {{assigned}} {{a position in the}} 1st Infantry Division and flew to Vietnam on May 21, 1969, during the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He worked as a staff officer, collecting data and helping in operations planning, and was awarded the Bronze Star for his work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff.</b> Clark was then given command of A Company, 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry of the 1st Infantry Division in January 1970. In February, only one month into his command, he was shot four times by a Viet Cong soldier with an AK-47. The wounded Clark shouted orders to his men, who counterattacked and defeated the Viet Cong force. Clark had injuries to his right shoulder, right hand, right hip, and right leg, and was sent to Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, to recuperate. He was awarded the Silver Star and the Combat Infantryman Badge for his actions during the encounter.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{about her}} role in voicing Saya, Mizuki said that she {{initially}} thought she would need to reimagine the entire character for her performance as Saya in the movie. It was later decided that the core character had changed little despite {{the events of the}} series finale, so Mizuki did not have to adjust her performance by much. Mizuki worked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> to help portray Saya's strained condition and deliberate isolation from others after the trauma of the series' events, although the sense of love still formed a strong part of Saya's character. Hashimoto's role as Mana was her first role in an anime movie, which proved challenging as Hashimoto needed to adjust to a new work environment, in particular performing convincingly without acting physically. She accepted the part based on her liking for CLAMP's manga work, recording all her lines separate {{from the rest of the}} cast. Fukuyama voiced Watanuki, making a cameo appearance from CLAMP's manga series xxxHolic. For the character's role in The Last Dark, Fukuyama needed to portray Watanuki as a mature character despite not aging from his appearance in xxxHolic.|$|E

5|$|The game {{opens with}} a {{terrorist}} attack on Chicago by the Knights Templar; a nanite bomb turns the entire city into grey goo, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> and trainees of the city's Tarsus Academy facility barely escaping in time. After relocating to Tarsus' Seattle facility, the city's own Tarsus facility is attacked by soldiers of the Order. Alex, discovering with Billie's help that Tarsus has been observing their trainees in secret {{under the guidance of}} Nassif, escapes the facility and is subsequently offered missions by Tarsus, the Order, the WTO, and the Omar. During these missions, Alex learns that their biomods were created by ApostleCorp, and follows Nassif from Seattle to Cairo, which is being disrupted by fighting between the factions. Alex's fellow students follow different paths during the narrative; Billie initially allies with the Order before joining the Knights Templar, Klara joins the WTO, while Leo becomes involved with the Omar and can become an unwilling convert.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the United States after the war, Juskalian had an appointment with the regular army where he was ultimately promoted to lieutenant colonel. He reported to the Pentagon for duty in the Office of the Secretary of the Army Chief of Staff from 1945–1948. In the Pentagon, Juskalian was assigned as an assistant secretary in the Secretariat of the War Department and was a secretary to Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Chief of Staff of the Army. His responsibilities included supporting the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combined Chiefs of Staff of the British and Americans and preparing briefs for Eisenhower. After his tour of duty at the Pentagon, he attended the Army's Command and General Staff College's regular ten-month course at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from 1948 to 1949. His next assignment was <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> and faculty of the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, where he remained from 1949 until the summer of 1952. While at the school, he took airborne training and became a qualified parachutist.|$|E
5|$|While {{portraying the}} bonds between {{the members of}} Class Zero, and between them and their summoned monsters, along with the game's themes of death and war, Naora drew {{inspiration}} from {{when he saw a}} cat killed by a car surrounded by other cats. Nomura was in charge of choosing the voice cast, which featured several well-known voice actors. When listening to the samples and picking the actors, Nomura focused on whether they could successfully project the characters' personalities. The actors and actresses helped define the characters, adding individual touches during voice recording sessions. Sayoko Hoshino acted as the game's character texture artist. Originally, she was going to put in black voids where a female character's panties would have been due to hardware limitations. However the staff realized that the players would be looking at the backs of characters a lot, so Hoshino designed panties for each female character and worked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff</b> to incorporate them into the character models.|$|E

5|$|The main {{character}} comes {{equipped with a}} staff after {{the initial stages of}} the game, which functions as both a weapon, and a tool for exploration and puzzle-solving. Combat is mainly melee-orientated, with players locking-on to an enemy upon moving in close. Once in combat, an enemy's health is displayed as a heart icon above them, with players able to strafe and roll around a target to dodge attack, while using the staff to either block incoming strikes, or attack an enemy. As a tool, the staff can be used to open containers, operate mechanisms, or lift up stones to uncover hidden caves and boulders to find items. As the player progress in the story, the staff can be upgraded with powers that can help in combat or assist in solving puzzles and exploring locations, including the ability to fire projectiles at enemies or trigger switches, and a special jump ability to reach places that are inaccessible through normal methods. However, using such powers requires magical energy, which the player can recover by retrieving special crystals from the environment. Along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>staff,</b> the player can also has a sidekick that joins them after a certain stage of the story, who can help by finding them items and using certain abilities to open up new areas. Such abilities, referred to as tricks, require the player to feed them with special mushrooms, with each one constituting one trick that can be performed, with the sidekick able to perform a maximum of six tricks when fully fed before needing more mushrooms. The game's inventory system focuses on three areas - items, staff powers, and tricks - with the player able to use three scanner systems in the game - a mini-map of a region (provided a map has been purchased first), a scanner to give information on objects in that are approached, and a fuel cell radar.|$|E
