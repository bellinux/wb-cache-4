Natural habitats include {{various types of}} woodland such as oak hardwoods and mixed oak-pine <b>woodlands,</b> ash and elmwoods, hickory-oak <b>woodlands</b> with a healthy amount of tangled undergrowth.

Very open <b>woodland</b> markedly shrunk from 13, 066  ha in 1985 to 11, 498  ha in 2015.

5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{will take}} over Eurasian nuthatch nest holes, reducing their breeding success. This {{is most likely to}} occur if the nest is high in a tree and there is a good local breeding density of the nuthatch. Introduced ring-necked parakeets may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend to occur in fragmented urban <b>woodlands,</b> while nuthatches prefer large old oak <b>woodlands,</b> which reduces the level of competition. Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that the problem was not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.|$|E
