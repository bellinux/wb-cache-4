2500|$|On January 16, 2013, Deadline {{announced}} that Ron Moore {{would return to}} the SyFy Channel as executive producer [...] of a new series Helix. [...] The project was [...] "written on spec" [...] by Cameron Porsandeh. Helix is described as being [...] "about a team of scientists investigating a possible disease outbreak at an Arctic research facility <b>who</b> <b>find</b> <b>themselves</b> trying to protect the world from annihilation." [...] SyFy Channel made a 13-episode direct-to-series order (i.e., without waiting to produce a pilot episode), and it began airing on SyFy on January 10, 2014. [...] While the marketing campaign for the TV series heavily billed Moore's involvement in the project, he only contributed as a consultant at the opening pitch meetings, and was not the creator or showrunner – thus his actual involvement in the project was very limited. [...] Though the series was praised by critics, it was cancelled after two seasons after the second season scored record low ratings.|$|E

[...] He pointed to the conduct of Samuel who was faced with similar circumstances and who combined [...] "sweetness with firmness, of consideration with energy, [...] constitute the temper of a perfect public man". Samuel was publicly dismayed at the Israelites' conduct and although he obeyed God in letting the people make their own way he protested [...] "in the most distinct and solemn tone, so as to throw the whole blame of what might ensue on their wilfulness". He continued to serve but with a heavy heart: [...] "God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you {{the good and the}} right way".|$|E

2500|$|Cutler {{began writing}} songs and poetry {{in the late}} 1950s, making {{the first of many}} {{appearances}} on BBC radio on the Home Service, where he featured on the Monday Night at Home programme on 38 occasions between 1959 and 1963. He gained popularity playing songs where he would often accompany himself on either a piano or the harmonium, and this success led to the release of a series of records starting with 1959's Ivor Cutler of Y'Hup EP. Cutler continued to make appearances on the BBC's programmes during the 1960s, {{and as a result of}} an appearance on the television show Late Night Line-Up, he was noticed by Paul McCartney, who invited Cutler to appear in The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour film. In the film, Cutler plays bus conductor Buster Bloodvessel, who becomes passionately attracted to Ringo Starr's Aunt Jessie. Following this film role, Cutler recorded an LP, Ludo (1967), produced by The Beatles' George Martin, and credited to the Ivor Cutler Trio, made up of Cutler with bassist Gill Lyons and percussionist Trevor Tomkins. The LP, taking inspiration from trad jazz and boogie-woogie, sees Cutler playing the piano as well as his usual harmonium, and is considered the most traditionally musical of all his records. After its release Cutler continued to perform for BBC radio, recording the first of his sessions for John Peel in 1969. Cutler's work on Peel's shows would introduce him to successive generations of fans, and in the early 1990s, Cutler said, [...] "Thanks to Peel, I gained a whole new audience, to the amazement of my older fans, <b>who</b> <b>find</b> <b>themselves</b> among 16-to-35s in theatres, and wonder where they came from." ...|$|E
