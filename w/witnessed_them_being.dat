5000|$|Two {{secondary}} explosions {{were generated}} by the first, and killed more miners and ponies before dissipating. In total, 20 miners {{were killed in the}} three explosions showing signs of burning, with a further 4 killed by the force of the explosion. Of the 81 men in the pit who survived the explosions, only 42 managed to reach the surface alive, as many miners were trapped by roof falls and succumbed to after-damp poisoning. Rescuers retrieving the bodies described how the miners’ footprints in the dust could be traced showing the roads they had travelled along in an endeavour to escape before they were overwhelmed. [...] All 11 miners who were in the Black Bed seam escaped. However, they heard and felt the force of the explosion in the Beeston Bed and were knocked off their feet or struck by trap doors. They were very quickly rendered unconscious for an hour by after-damp, and upon waking, the Deputy, Robert Henry Nevins, was asked by the young teenage miners to pray for them. With the cages out of operation, they had to scramble up a stone drift to reach the Beeston Bed and were overcome by afterdamp again, 600 yards from shaft. Barely able to walk, they were forced to leave behind one of their party, Fred Atkinson, and upon reaching the No.2 shaft, another party of survivors gathered there <b>witnessed</b> <b>them</b> <b>being</b> violently ill and in distress. The sick and injured were the first to be sent up to the surface two hours later once repairs had been made to the cage.|$|E

5000|$|The Hyperboreans have kidnapped Rann, the {{daughter}} of Njal, head of a band of Aesir, who leads his men on a raid to win her back. The young Cimmerian Conan participates in the raid. Ominously, the thirty men sent ahead as scouts vanish, and when the rest reach the enemy stronghold they <b>witness</b> <b>them</b> <b>being</b> tortured to death on the fortress walls. Conan infiltrates the castle and recovers the girl, whereupon the Aesir take flight for Asgard, pursued by the Hyperboreans. Turning at bay, Njal's men realize that the reanimated corpses of their slain comrades are among those fighting against them. In the ensuing battle, Conan is taken by the enemy.

50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the killing of Michael Collins on 25 August 1922 an atrocity occurred. Two Anti-Treaty Republicans Alfie(Leo) Colley (18), and Sean Cole (17), members of Fianna Éireann. They were abducted by Free State forces North Strand. <b>Witnesses</b> saw <b>them</b> <b>being</b> shot dead at 'The Thatch', Puck's Lane or Yellow Lane, (now Yellow Road) in Whitehall.

5000|$|... 25 August 1922. One of {{the most}} despicable murders of Republicans took place at Whitehall, Dublin on this date. Alfie(Leo) Colley (18), Parnell Street, and Sean Cole (17), Buckingham Street, were two {{of the most}} senior Fianna {{officers}} in the Dublin Brigade of Fianna Éireann. They were picked up at Newcomen Bridge, North Strand, on their way home from a meeting of officers at Marino. A witness stated that their abductors were wearing trench coats over Free State Army officers uniforms. <b>Witnesses</b> saw <b>them</b> <b>being</b> shot dead at The Thatch, Pucks Lane, (now Yellow Road), Whitehall. Popular opinion at the time was that their killings were a reprisal for the death of Michael Collins earlier that week.|$|R

Spending long hours alone in the forest as he hikes between lookout spots, Richard begins to experience hallucinations in which Daffy appears: they converse and patrol the part of the island which Richard refers to as the DMZ together. Richard comes to appreciate that Daffy killed himself because he could neither endure the unravelling of his elitist vision of the beach as the group grew in size, nor bear the thought of a return to backpacking or settled life, and notes that he himself is falling prey to that way of thinking. Richard also realizes that Daffy gave him the map — as well as spreading rumors of the island all over Thailand — so many travelers would come looking for the beach, inevitably leading to it becoming a tourist destination. Daffy describes this act as [...] "euthanizing" [...] the community, and Richard realizes he was merely a pawn in Daffy's revenge plan. This comes to a head following the arrival of the American/German group by raft. Unlike Richard, Étienne, and Françoise who managed to overcome all obstacles in getting to the beach, the newcomers never make it past the most dangerous hurdle: the cannabis farmers. Richard <b>witnesses</b> <b>them</b> <b>being</b> first beaten violently and then dragged away. The sound of gunshots implies the farmers have murdered the intruders.|$|R
30|$|The above {{discussion}} {{has attempted to}} demonstrate how the dominant narratives of the dairy industry - that the industry’s ideological frameworks support taken-for-granted understandings through which dairy cows and calves are exploited - can be countered by an animal rights video activist practice. The primary focus of this activism is the sentient dairy animal which has become increasingly commodified and valued {{in terms of its}} usefulness as a source of further economic growth. In other words, the video activist practice attempts to bear witness to the instrumental value of dairy animals being given precedence over all other valuations which works to justify the overriding worldview that the ongoing exploitation of non-human nature is ‘necessary’ to the human project. Within this discourse, the very idea that dairy animals might be given equal consideration to those of humans becomes unthinkable. The camera <b>witnessing</b> <b>them</b> as <b>being</b> turned into objects, to be valued according to their use and to be bought and sold in the global capitalist market place provides the central content of animal rights video activist footage.|$|R
40|$|One of the unsolved {{problems}} in the characterization of the optimal entanglement witnesses is the existence of optimal witnesses acting on bipartite Hilbert spaces H_m,n=C^m⊗ C^n such that the product vectors obeying = 0 do not span H_m,n. So far, the only known examples of such witnesses were found among indecomposable <b>witnesses,</b> one of <b>them</b> <b>being</b> the <b>witness</b> corresponding to the Choi map. However, it {{remains an open question}} whether decomposable witnesses exist without the property of spanning. Here we answer this question affirmatively, providing systematic examples of such witnesses. Then, we generalize some of the recently obtained results on the characterization of 2 ⊗ n optimal decomposable witnesses [R. Augusiak et al., J. Phys. A 44, 212001 (2011) ] to finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces H_m,n with m,n≥ 3. Comment: 11 pages, published version, title modified, some references added, other minor improvement...|$|R
