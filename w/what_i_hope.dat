25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning. As I have {{discussed}} with some of my friends over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> will be an interesting and diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my family. I was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I am grateful for the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E

I think we would have {{expected}} a lot of drama, and the truth is, she is probably the most down-to-earth person. It was endearing. She was friendly and kind. ... I think, for us, we're so excited to have someone of her talent, and to have somebody like that shoot here is a sheer honor. What her music does for music is so much more than entertainment. It's connecting to the arts on a much deeper level, and that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> we can do here." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{wished to}} set the film in a field he {{understood}} and opted for broadcast journalism. After talking with network journalists at the 1984 Republican National Convention, Brooks realised it had [...] "changed so much since I had been near it", and so [...] "did {{about a year and}} a half of solid research," [...] into the industry. When he began writing the screenplay, Brooks felt he [...] "didn't like any of the three [...] characters", but decided not to change them and after two months had reversed his original opinion. Brooks stated that this also happens to the audience: [...] "You're always supposed to arc your characters and you have this change and that's your dramatic purpose. But <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> happens in this film is that the audience takes part in the arc. So what happens is that the movie doesn't select its own hero. It plays differently with each audience. The audience helps create the experience, depending on which character they hook onto." [...] He did not decide on the ending of the film until the rest of it had been completed. Brooks was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay for Broadcast News. At the 38th Berlin International Film Festival, the film was nominated for the Golden Bear and Holly Hunter won the Silver Bear for Best Actress.|$|E

500|$|Connotations was {{the first}} orchestral work in which Copland used serial {{principles}} of composition. Serial or twelve-tone music, Copland stated, carried [...] "a built-in tenseness... a certain drama... a sense of strain or tension" [...] inherent in its extended use of chromaticism. [...] "These are new tensions," [...] he continued, [...] "different from what I would have dreamt up if I had been thinking tonally." [...] To composer John Adams, Copland's embrace of serial technique was not really such as stretch [...] "because ever since the 1920s, he'd already a piss-'n-vinegar penchant for sour intervals, like {{he did in the}} Piano Variations." [...] Contrary to the charge that would be made after Connotations premiere that Copland wrote a twelve-tone work to impress younger composers, he had actually begun using the method at a time when few other American composers were doing so. While Copland's first expressly serial works were his Piano Quartet of 1950 and Piano Fantasy and he noted that some critics (whom he did not name) had traced a similarity in those pieces to his Piano Variations of 1930, he claimed in his 1967 [...] "conversation" [...] with Edward T. Cone that the Variations were [...] "the start of my interest in serial writing... Although it doesn't use all twelve tones, it does use seven of them in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> is a consistently logical way." [...] Prior to that interview, few had related Copland's early work to that of the founder of twelve-tone composition, Arnold Schoenberg.|$|E

A vintage car racing enthusiast, Franchitti will be {{focusing}} on ensuring {{the authenticity of the}} game’s historic and vintage cars [...] "It’s almost impossible to describe the feeling you get inside when you’re behind the wheel of an old race car but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> {{to be able to do}} is use my knowledge and experience to help the team at Simraceway replicate how it feels to drive,".|$|E
2500|$|In February 2013, Williams {{expressed}} {{his interest in}} working in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, stating: [...] "Now we’re hearing of {{a new set of}} movies coming in 2015, 2016... so I need to make sure I'm still ready to go in a few years for <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> would be continued work with George." [...] He also scored the 2013 film The Book Thief, which marked his first collaboration with a director other than Spielberg since 2005. The score earned him Academy Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations and earned him a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition. It was his 44th nomination for Best Original Score (and 49th overall), setting a new record for the most nominations in that category (he previously tied Alfred Newman's record of 43 nominations in 2013).|$|E

2500|$|After [...] "I'm Yours" [...] {{remained}} at the Billboard Hot 100 chart for a record 76 weeks ending in October 2009 (peaking at number 6), Mraz headed to the Gulf of Mexico {{during the summer of}} 2010 to help with efforts to clean the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Later, he went to a trip to Ghana to fight child slavery alongside the nonprofit organization Free the Slaves. Later, Mraz was in Antarctica, spending time with Al Gore and learning about climate change aboard the National Geographic Explorer. During his activist outings, Mraz wrote and recorded his fourth album, Love Is a Four Letter Word, with producer Joe Chiccarelli. In an interview for Billboard, he confessed that he was less interested in following up his biggest hit than using the power that [...] "I'm Yours" [...] gave him to fuel positive change. He further elaborated: [...] "The pressure I put on myself, or <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> my 'I Won't Give Up' does, is {{to make a difference in}} people's lives [...] [...] [...] With 'I'm Yours,' I got to go out and set my feet on different continents, and expose myself to different cultures and causes. I wanted to see who I was, outside of music." ...|$|E

5000|$|Two {{years after}} {{completion}} of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, Lee released a 192-page collection of his conceptual artwork for the project, entitled The Lord of the Rings Sketchbook (HarperCollins, 2005). Film director Peter Jackson said, [...] "His art captured <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> to capture with the films." ...|$|R

[...] "Bob has turned out exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> he would--a fine young fellow, and a gentleman. He has excellent manners, and yet there is nothing foppish, or affected about him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Now you see,' said Peg, {{kneeling}} down on {{the floor}} beside him, and staying his impatient hand; 'what's of no use we'll burn; what we can get any money by, we'll keep; and if there's any we could get him into trouble by, and fret and waste away his heart to shreds, those we'll take particular care of; for that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want to do, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> to do when I left him.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Again {{the care}} crept into Barrington's face, {{and he sat}} silent for almost a minute. Then he said, very slowly, [...] "I feel that I should resent the question, but I will answer. It is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> to do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I hope I'll {{never live}} out of Ireland. Though I mayn't have tact {{to make one}} {{thousand}} {{go as far as}} five, I've sense enough to see that a poor absentee landlord is a great curse to his country; and that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> I never shall be." ...|$|E

60|$|Right in {{the middle}} of the speech I had placed a gem. I had put in a moving, pathetic part which was to get at the hearts and souls of my hearers.

Then I happened to glance up at the box where the Governor's wife was--you know what happened.|$|R
