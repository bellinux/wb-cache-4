In this study, {{different}} lipophilic {{groups from}} 3 -aminpropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) {{were used to}} alter the surface structure of nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC).

A new approach was introduced for measuring contact angles on human oral mucosa in vivo. It was shown that the <b>wetting</b> <b>properties</b> of CMC- and mucin-containing saliva substitutes on human enamel were significantly better than those ofhuman whole saliva. On human oral mucosa, the <b>wetting</b> <b>properties</b> of CMC-containing saliva sub-stitutes and human whole saliva were comparable, but were surpassed by those of the mucin-containing saliva substitutes.

In this study mixture of cationic (Cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide, CTAB) and non-ionic (Igepal- 630) surfactants have been studied and compared with the pure surfactants. The nonideal behaviour of the mixture indicates the presence of synergism. Another point of attraction for the investigators has been the effect of additives in surfactant solution.

Plant surfactants {{on the other hand}} are cheaper and also suitable for mass production compared to surfactants extracted from microbial source,but it hasinferior wetting and surface tension properties compared to synthetic surfactant. So,silver nanoparticle was used as an additive,as it has antimicrobial properties and also increases the <b>wetting</b> <b>property</b> of the surfactant.

40|$|The wetting of solids by {{liquid is}} gaining {{a lot of}} {{importance}} as it is connected to physical chemistry (wettability) to statistical physics (wetting transition) and long-range forces (van der Waals, double layer) to fluid dynamics. The present study mainly focused {{on the effect of}} nanoparticles on the wetting of different solid surfaces, as nanoparticles are gaining importance because of their wide applications in various field like pharmaceutical, biomedical and electronics. The effect of two different nanoparticles hydrophobic (sulfur) and hydrophilic (TiO 2) on both the hydrophilic (glass) and hydrophobic (PTFE) surfaces have been studied. The sulfur nanoparticles were prepared by acid catalyzed precipitation reaction from sodium thiosulphate, whereas TiO 2 is prepared by hydrolysis of trititanium (IV) butaoxide (TBOT). It is observed the use of nanoparticles enhanced the wetting process as compared to the base liquids without nanoparticles. The effect of reactant concentration on the particles size of both particles is initially studied and the results shows with increasing concentration the particles size increases in both the cases. Then the effect of particles size on the wetting of glass and PTFE surfaces were studied by measuring surface tension and contact angle. In the presence of the sulfur particles the <b>wetting</b> <b>property</b> of the both surfaces increases whereas, due to the presence of TiO 2 particles the <b>wetting</b> <b>property</b> increases for PTFE surface but the <b>wetting</b> <b>property</b> decreases for the glass surface.

40|$|A liquid drop {{impacting}} a {{dry solid}} surface with sufficient kinetic energy will splash, breaking apart into numerous secondary droplets. This phenomenon shows many similarities to forced wetting, including the entrainment of {{air at the}} contact line. Because of these similarities {{and the fact that}} forced wetting has been shown to depend on the <b>wetting</b> <b>properties</b> of the surface, existing theories predict splashing to depend on <b>wetting</b> <b>properties</b> as well. However, using high-speed interference imaging we observe that <b>wetting</b> <b>properties</b> have no effect on splashing for various liquid-surface combinations. Additionally, by fully resolving the Navier-Stokes equations at length and time scales inaccessible to experiments, we find that the shape and motion of the air-liquid interface at the contact line are independent of wettability. We use these findings to evaluate existing theories and to compare splashing with forced wetting...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the optical}} and {{mechanical}} properties of polyurethane were improved by modified nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC). The surface of NCC was modified by 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) and 3 -methacryloxy-propyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) {{to overcome the}} lack of compatibility with polyurethane. Polyurethane with modified NCC was characterized by <b>wetting</b> <b>property,</b> X-ray powder diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. The pencil hardness, specular gloss, and abrasion resistance of modified polyurethane were determined using the methods of Chinese National Standards GB/T 6739 - 2006, GB/T 9754 - 2007, and GB/T 1768 - 2006. The <b>wetting</b> <b>property</b> of NCC modified by GPTMS increased by 25. 9 %, and modification from MPS resulted in a 22. 5 % decrease of the contact angle. MPS-modified NCC affected the crystal structure and thermal stability of polyurethane more significantly than NCC modified by GPTMS. The pencil hardness of polyurethane was enhanced with 1. 5 % modified NCC. The specular gloss and abrasion resistance of modified polyurethane increased by 253. 1 % (1. 0 % NCC modified by GPTMS) and 59. 4 % (1. 5 % NCC modified by GPTMS), respectively.

40|$|Fresh TiO 2 {{was found}} to possess a strong {{germicidal}} activity even without UV irradiation. Live Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells in contact with fresh TiO 2 were found deformed and dead after 15 min contact. The cause of germicidal activity was discussed from the observed cell deformation, lysis and increased absorption at 1680 cm(- 1) in FT-IR spectra of the affected cells, which proved the oxidizing effect of fresh TiO 2 to cells. The deformation caused by the stretching of cell wall and pressure built-up inside the cell, led to cell burst and release of intracellular materials. The degree of cell deformation was found positively related with the <b>wetting</b> <b>property</b> of TiO 2, Cells are negatively charged, for Gram-negative cell (thinner cell wall), a higher germicidal effect was observed than Gram-positive cells. The germicidal effect of TiO 2 gradually decreased after exposure to air at room temperature, as the <b>wetting</b> <b>property</b> decreased. This kind of germicidal activity was more effective compared to other germicidal process such as UVA/TiO 2 or Ag+.

To explain this inconsistency available data on the adsorption of fluorosurfactants on liquid/vapour, solid/liquid and solid/vapour interfaces are discussed in comparison to those of hydrocarbon surfactants.
