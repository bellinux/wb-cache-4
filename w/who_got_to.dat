25|$|The pros {{were given}} a points system just like the amateurs. A first in the Main will earn a AA pro 240 points second 200, 160 for third and so on until six place would be worth 40 points. As in the amateur {{divisions}} the pros would earn rider points. The top ten pros would be determined by this points ranking. Additionally the best ten finishes at the nationals plus the Grand Nationals (making it eleven races) would count toward the pros eligibility to contend for the Pro #1 plate. Purse money would be distributed not only among the racers who made the main, but also those <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the semis or even didn't make it that far, so practically every one got something for racing, {{even if it was}} just a one hundred percent payback on their entrance fee.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the many}} Gothic {{sculpture}}s {{from the early}} 16th century, the Archangel Gabriel, crucifixion and small sculpture of Christ sufferer by Master Paul have been preserved. The original sculpture of Calvary on beam of triumphal arch allegedly damaged fire in the 17th century. The monumental sculpture of the crucified has extremely high artistic quality and its dramatic expressive comprehension is {{the evidence of the}} fact that it was created under the influence of German art in the first half of the 14th century. From the Gothic wing altars on both sides 14 painted panels were preserved, originally belonged to the altar of St. Nicholas and the Virgin Mary. They are traditionally attributed to craftsman Peter and Albert Molers from Presov; they worked on them in 1497-1506. Older written sources mention also the panel painting of St. Anny Samotretia <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Nemzeti Museum in Budapest. A Gothic temple facilities also include mural paintings on the north wall of the middle presbytery from the late 15th and the early 16th century, which displays a knight on horseback and female figures.|$|E

[...] He was also fifth in Game Revolution's list of top [...] "old school" [...] Mortal Kombat characters", praised for his introduction in Mortal Kombat and his changes in the sequel. IGN listed him as a character {{they would like to see}} as downloadable content for Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, noting [...] "It's just not (a Mortal Kombat) game without a bevy of palette-swapped ninjas...and our vote goes to Reptile," [...] adding that while the character would be a [...] "pain in the ass to fight sometimes", his inclusion would be [...] "a blessing to have on your side." [...] He was also featured in the 2008 MSN article about the ten greatest Easter eggs in gaming. In 2010 UGO, included him on the list of the 25 coolest hidden characters in video gaming. ScrewAttack placed Reptile at ninth place on their list of top ten Mortal Kombat characters, commenting that anyone <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> fight him in the original Mortal Kombat became a local legend and getting to play as him and turn invisible in Mortal Kombat II was [...] "icing on the cake".

After years in print it was re-issued in a new format in 1999, winning that year's National Outdoor Book Award (NOBA). [...] A hardcover [...] "commemorative edition", celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the publication of One Man's Wilderness, was published by Alaska Northwest Books in 2013. In 2003, some of the copyrighted text from the book and some of Proenneke's film were used with permission in the documentary Alone in the Wilderness, which began appearing on U.S. Public Television. It follows Proenneke's life as he builds a cabin from the surrounding natural resources and includes his film footage and narration of wildlife, weather, and the natural scenery while he goes about his daily routine {{over the course of the}} winter months.|$|E
2500|$|As {{historian}} Richard Beeman put it, Henry {{was a man}} who [...] "did {{not bother}} to write much of anything down", a handicap when being evaluated by history. The lack of primary source materials regarding Henry—only a handful of papers and a few of his speeches survive—has frustrated Henry's biographers from Wirt (1817) to Beeman (1974): Wirt commented two years before publishing his book, [...] "It is all speaking, speaking, speaking. 'Tis true he could talk—Gods! how he could talk! but... to make the matter worse, from 1763 to 1789... not [...] one of his speeches lives in print, writing or memory". Beeman, for his part, concluded, [...] "the Revolutionary firebrand, whatever his achievements, possessed a miserable sense of history". This was a deficiency not possessed by Jefferson, who not only survived Henry by a quarter century, but <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> fill the vacuum of information about Henry with his own recollections and opinions. Wirt did not print many of Jefferson's criticisms of Henry, which irritated the former president to such an extent he was still mentioning it to guests at Monticello in 1824. Nevertheless, Jefferson's negative assessments of Henry have sullied the latter's historical reputation.|$|E

2500|$|Season three saw the {{directing}} {{debut of}} one of the show’s developers, Miles Millar, <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> direct the episode [...] "Memoria". Welling describes Millar’s style as very succinct, to which he credits to Millar’s background of writing for all of the characters on the show. As Welling explains, Millar managed to capture the same effect as other directors, but with fewer words. Millar’s visual style, at least for this episode, tended to lean more to applying [...] "extreme lighting" [...] to the scenes, to create silhouettes of the characters. Miles Millar was inspired by the film Kings Row when he filmed the scene for Lex’s birthday party as a child. In the scene, a camera pulls back from a flashback transition to reveal a young Lex sitting alone at a large table full of food and gifts. Instead of using the same techniques that were employed in previous episodes for transitioning between the present and the past, Millar decided to shift between the two time frames by transitioning between the older Lex and the younger Lex. This required Rosenbaum to rely more on Millar’s direction, so that the emotional level was matched between himself and the young actor portraying Lex, Wayne Dalglish. One particular scene seemed to provide Millar with the most trouble, mainly because of the constraints of the film division at Warner Bros. In the scene, Jor-El and Lara are placing the infant Kal-El into his spaceship during Krypton’s final moments. At the time, Warner Bros. was working on a new Superman film, and {{it was going to be}} an origin story. This affected how much Smallville could actually show. The film department prohibited Millar from showing Krypton, or Jor-El and Lara. As a result, Millar took inspiration from a comic book written by Jeph Loeb. In Loeb’s book, Jor-El and Lara are depicted as just a pair of hands holding on to each other after they place Kal-El into his spaceship.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2011, Scott Brown {{said that}} Forrest {{was the best}} player {{to come out of}} the Celtic youth academy since Aiden McGeady. Forrest scored his first goal of the season in a 5–1 victory against Dundee United and his {{performances}} in the month of September, including two goals in a 4–0 victory against Motherwell and another goal against Inverness Caledonian Thistle, saw him win SPL Young Player of the Month. In Celtic's Scottish League Cup quarter final tie with Hibernian on 26 October, Forrest was credited with a match winning performance. Celtic went in at the break 1–0 down but Forrest was instrumental in reigniting the tie after half-time, with two early goals. On 31 October 2011, Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur's chief scout Ian Broomfield was reported to have watched Forrest in action. Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp later confirmed this was true and that he believed Forrest to be a good player. However, he also said that at that stage he had not considered making a bid for Forrest. In November 2011, the Scottish Football Association's Dutch performance director Mark Wotte, who helped start the careers of players like Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder, said that he sees Forrest as being [...] "the light in the darkness" [...] of Scottish football. He said that if more players like Forrest are produced then the Scotland team will be able to match the performance of countries like Uruguay, <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the 2010 World Cup semi-final and at the time were fourth in the FIFA World Rankings despite having a population smaller than Scotland's. Forrest won the SPL Young Player of the Month award for November, his second of the season. In January 2012, Forrest was named one of the 13 players to watch in 2012 by world football governing body FIFA. [...] Forrest's season ended after suffering an injury during Celtic's defeat to Kilmarnock in the Scottish League Cup Final. He finished the season having scored nine goals and won his second major honour at the end of the season when Celtic finished as SPL Champions. [...] His form over the season also saw him win two personal awards as both the Scottish Football Writers' Association and Professional Footballers' Association Scotland voted him their respective Young Player of the Year.|$|E

60|$|The {{distance}} of the long run was as nearly as possible five miles.

Every Eckletonian who ran at all knew the route by heart. It was the recognised training run if you wanted to train particularly hard. If you did not, you took a shorter spin. At the milestone nearest the school--it was about half a mile from the gates--a good number of fellows used to wait to see the first of the runners and pace their men home. But, as a rule, there were few really hot finishes in the long run. The man <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Ledby first generally kept the advantage, and came in a long way ahead of the field.|$|E

60|$|He sang it well, {{even as a}} song; but he {{did better}} yet a performer. I have heard famous actors, when {{there was not a}} dry eye in the Edinburgh theatre; a great wonder to behold; but no more {{wonderful}} than how the Master played upon that little ballad, and on those who heard him, like an instrument, and seemed now upon the point of failing, and now to conquer his distress, so that words and music seemed to pour out of his own heart and his own past, and to be aimed directly at Mrs. Henry. And his art went further yet; for all was so delicately touched, it seemed impossible to suspect him of the least design; and so far from making a parade of emotion, you would have sworn he was striving to be calm. When it came to an end, we all sat silent for a time; he had chosen the dusk of the afternoon, so that none could see his neighbour's face; but it seemed as if we held our breathing; only my old lord cleared his throat. The first to move was the singer, <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> his feet suddenly and softly, and went and walked softly to and fro in {{the low end of the}} hall, Mr. Henry's customary place. We were to suppose that he there struggled down the last of his emotion; for he presently returned and launched into a disquisition on the nature of the Irish (always so much miscalled, and whom he defended) in his natural voice; so that, before the lights were brought, we were in the usual course of talk. But even then, methought Mrs. Henry's face was a shade pale; and, for another thing, she withdrew almost at once.|$|E
60|$|Passing {{from this}} {{wonderful}} sight to the Ships again--for my heart, {{as to the}} Yard, is where the ships are--I notice certain unfinished wooden walls left seasoning on the stocks, pending {{the solution of the}} merits of the wood and iron question, and having an air of biding their time with surly confidence. The names of these worthies are set up beside them, together with their capacity in guns--a custom highly conducive to ease and satisfaction in social intercourse, if it could be adapted to mankind. By a plank more gracefully pendulous than substantial, I make bold to go aboard a transport ship (iron screw) just sent in from the contractor's yard to be inspected and passed. She is a very gratifying experience, in the simplicity and humanity of her arrangements for troops, in her provision for light and air and cleanliness, and in her care for women and children. It occurs to me, as I explore her, that I would require a handsome sum of money to go aboard her, at midnight by the Dockyard bell, and stay aboard alone till morning; for surely she must be haunted by a crowd of ghosts of obstinate old martinets, mournfully flapping their cherubic epaulettes over the changed times. Though still we may learn from the astounding ways and means in our Yards now, more highly than ever to respect the forefathers <b>who</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> sea, and fought the sea, and held the sea, without them. This remembrance putting me in the best of tempers with an old hulk, very green as to her copper, and generally dim and patched, I pull off my hat to her.
