For Unger, there are no natural laws. Rather, he takes to the hilt the modernist thesis that we are shaped by context but not bound by context. As such, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to work both within and beyond any constraints of social or cultural binds.|$|E

[...] He also said, [...] "I believe that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to deter Iran, should it become nuclear." ...|$|E

It is my passion, and has been for a long time. Poverty, conflict, violence, crime, exclusion and so forth are not givens. They happen for a reason. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to change things. And sport is one vehicle for doing so. It has the power to build bridges, to empower, to teach, to heal – this is what triathlon and every other sport should be about.

2500|$|As the {{government}} pulled in regular Syrian troops from peripheral areas {{for the military}} assault on Aleppo, there was clear evidence that others are almost seamlessly moving into the vacuum left behind. And in some Kurdish parts of northern Syria the opposition forces of the Democratic Union Party (PYD) and other smaller factions have all but taken over. The leader of the PYD, Salih Muslim, spoke to the BBC in recent days about his movement's strategy and aspirations. [...] "We are able to govern ourselves - <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> for it," [...] he said. Mr Muslim was careful to insist, at this stage at least, that he wasn't calling for an independent Kurdistan but an autonomous region within a new, democratic Syria. It is thought that Kurdish militias now control at least four main towns and cities in northern Syria. They reportedly include at least parts of Qamishlo, Efrin, Amude, Terbaspi and Ayn El Arab. More remarkable is that although there were sporadic clashes and some loss of life many of them {{appear to have been}} secured without much of a fight.|$|E

They saw according to their own unchangeable idea, subjectively, they did not go forth from themselves to seek the wonder outside.|$|E

In the late 21st century a {{peaceful}} and prosperous humanity, just mastering the technology enabling it {{to explore the}} galaxy at relativistic speeds, is blindsided by a massive, devastating attack of relativistic kill vehicles. Boulder-sized chunks of metal, with kinetic energy in the multi-megaton range, they are impossible to track and impossible to stop. Humanity is all but wiped out by this horrific bombardment, which has its origin in the Alpha Centauri AB-C system. The cephalopod Alphans explain that the attack was pre-emptive: The moment we learned to travel at relativistic speeds was <b>the</b> moment <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to do to them {{what they did to}} us first.|$|R

A parallel story could be told of the metallurgy of copper and tin, and of a multitude of metals, nickel and aluminium to name but two, unknown before the nineteenth century dawned. It is in this great and growing mastery over substances, over different sorts of glass, over rocks and plasters and the like, over colours and textures, that the main triumphs of the mechanical revolution have thus far been achieved. Yet {{we are still in}} the stage of the first fruits in the matter. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power,</b> but we have still {{to learn how to use}} our power.

Of course I cannot expect a young lady to understand the technical details of the mode, in which this is done, but you will understand that by tests taken at either end the damage appeared to be about 118 miles from Kurrachee, and a telegraph steamer was sent with an electrical and engineering staff to repair it.

60|$|This picture, placed {{beneath the}} figure of the Virgin Annunciate at the east end of the chapel, and {{necessarily}} small, (as will be seen by the plan), in consequence of the space occupied by the arch which it flanks, begins the second or lower series of frescoes; being, at the same time, the first of the great chain of more familiar subjects, in which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> of comparing the conceptions of Giotto not only with the designs of earlier ages, but with the efforts which subsequent masters have made to exalt or vary the ideas of the principal scenes {{in the life of the}} Virgin and of Christ. The two paintings of the Angel Gabriel and the Virgin Annunciate hardly provoke such a comparison, being almost statue-like in the calm subjection of all dramatic interest to the symmetrical dignity and beauty of the two figures, leading, as they do, the whole system of the decoration of the chapel; but this of the Salutation is treated with no such reference to the architecture, and at once challenges comparison with the works of later masters.|$|E

Such I {{conceive}} to be {{the directions}} in which, principally, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to excel; and you must at once see how the consideration of them must modify the advisable methods of our art study. For if our professional painters were likely to produce pieces of art loftily ideal in their character, it would be desirable to form {{the taste of the}} students here by setting before them only the purest examples of Greek, and the mightiest of Italian, art. But I do not think you will yet find a single instance of a school directed exclusively to these higher branches of study in England, which has strongly, or even definitely, made impression on its younger scholars. While, therefore, I shall endeavour to point out clearly the characters to be looked for and admired in the great masters of imaginative design, I shall make no special effort to stimulate the imitation of them; and above all things, I shall try to probe in you, and to prevent, the affectation into which it is easy to fall, even through modesty,--of either endeavouring to admire a grandeur with which we have no natural sympathy, or losing the pleasure we might take in the study of familiar things, by considering it a sign of refinement to look for what is of higher class, or rarer occurrence.|$|E
