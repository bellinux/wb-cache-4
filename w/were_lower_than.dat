5|$|In Nicotiana attenuata HypSys {{is known}} to not be {{involved}} in defence against insect herbivores. Silencing and over-expression of HypSys {{does not affect the}} feeding performance of larvae compared to normal plants. Berger silenced HypSys and found that it caused changes in flower morphology which reduced the efficiency of self-pollination. The flowers had pistils that protruded beyond their anthers, a similar phenotype to CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE1-silenced plants which lack a jasmonate receptor. Measurement of jasmonate levels in the flowers revealed that they <b>were</b> <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> in normal plants. The authors suggested that HypSys peptides in N. attenuata have diversified from their function as defence related peptides to being involved in controlling flower morphology. The signalling processes remain similar however, being mediated through jasmonates.|$|E

5|$|In the Pleistocene era Mingulay {{was covered}} by the ice sheets which spread from Scotland out into the Atlantic Ocean beyond the Outer Hebrides.

The ice deposited both erratic blocks of rock and boulder clay on {{the eastern side of the}} island around Mingulay Bay.

Although these quotas <b>were</b> <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> the originals set in 1982 (500 tons for Norway and 300 tons for the Faroe Islands), they were still consistently higher than the yearly total porbeagle catch {{in the region and}} thus had no practical effect.

5|$|No traces {{have yet}} {{been found in}} Scotland of either a Neanderthal {{presence}} or of Homo sapiens during the Pleistocene interglacials. The first indications of humans occur only after the ice retreated in the 11th millennium BC and the current Flandrian interglacial began. Since that time the landscape of Orkney has been altered by both human and natural forces. Initially, sea levels <b>were</b> <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> at present due to the large volume of ice that remained. This meant that the Orkney islands may have been attached to the mainland, as was the present-day island of Great Britain to Continental Europe. Much of the North Sea basin was also dry land until after 4000 BC. This would have made travel to northern Scotland relatively easy for early human settlers. The subsequent isostatic rise of land makes estimating post-glacial coastlines a complex task.|$|E
