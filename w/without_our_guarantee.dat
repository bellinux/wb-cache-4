50|$|Since I have {{declared}} the time come to strike against England in autumn 1916 {{the situation has}} even improved tremendously in our favour.

40|$|We {{propose a}} type-based {{analysis}} to infer the session protocols of channels in an ML-like concurrent functional language.

It also supports provably complete session inference for finite sessions with no programmer annotations. We exhibit the usefulness of our system with interesting examples, including one which is not typable in substructural type systems...|$|R
