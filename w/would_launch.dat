On July 8, 2016, the game was released for the Windows platform.|$|E
5|$|Most of Demosthenes' major orations were {{directed}} against the growing power of King Philip II of Macedon. Since 357BC, when Philip seized Amphipolis and Pydna, Athens had been formally {{at war with the}} Macedonians. In 352BC, Demosthenes characterised Philip as the very worst enemy of his city; his speech presaged the fierce attacks that Demosthenes <b>would</b> <b>launch</b> against the Macedonian king over the ensuing years. A year later he criticised those dismissing Philip as a person of no account and warned that he was as dangerous as the king of Persia.|$|E

5|$|On September 29, Walter Schirra, Eisele, and Walter Cunningham {{were named}} {{as the prime}} crew for a second Block I CSM flight, AS-205. NASA planned to follow this with an {{unmanned}} test flight of the LM (AS-206), then the third manned mission would be a dual flight designated AS-278 (or AS-207/208), in which AS-207 <b>would</b> <b>launch</b> the first manned Block II CSM, which would then rendezvous and dock with the LM launched unmanned on AS-208.|$|E
5|$|Smallpeice {{attempted}} {{to defend the}} company against a takeover, commissioning a report from McKinsey & Company on the future outlook of the company. This course of action would ultimately prove futile and Trafalgar House <b>would</b> <b>launch</b> a successful bid for the company, beginning on 30 June 1971. Smallpeice accepted an increased bid from Trafalgar House {{at the end of}} July, and would go on to preside over the last board meeting of Cunard as an independent company on 25 August 1971, 93 years after its incorporation.|$|E
5|$|The most {{inflammatory}} rumour {{was that}} Washington <b>would</b> <b>launch</b> an attack {{to liberate the}} north when all anti-communists had fled south. It claimed that the Americans would use atomic bombs {{and that the only}} way of avoiding death in a nuclear holocaust was to move south. Lansdale's team disseminated pamphlets that depicted Hanoi with three circles of nuclear destruction superimposed on it. Lansdale's saboteurs also poured sugar into the petrol tanks of Viet Minh vehicles. Soothsayers were bribed to predict disaster under communism, and prosperity for those who went south.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike the Apollo missions, {{where both}} the Apollo Command/Service Module and the Apollo Lunar Module were {{launched}} {{together on the}} Saturn V rocket, the manned Orion craft <b>would</b> be <b>launched</b> separately from the unmanned EDS and lunar lander. The Ares V/EDS/Altair stack would be assembled at the Vehicle Assembly Building and then transported to Pad A of Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39, and the Ares I/Orion stack would be transported to the adjacent Pad 39B. The Ares V/EDS/Altair stack <b>would</b> be <b>launched</b> first, into a [...] high circular orbit. Approximately 90 minutes later, the AresI/Orion <b>would</b> then <b>launch</b> with the crew into a nearly identical orbit.|$|R

5|$|Through July {{and early}} August, Montgomery and Schuyler {{continued}} to organize their force, raising {{the men and}} materials needed for an invasion. While they organized, Washington decided to expand the invasion, ordering Benedict Arnold to lead another invasion force that would invade Quebec from Maine. It was to join with Schuyler's army outside Quebec City, where they <b>would</b> <b>launch</b> a joint attack on to the city.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} studies {{investigated}} sending a Gemini spacecraft onto a circumlunar trajectory. Many of the proposals made for this involved a double-launch architecture, with the Gemini spacecraft rendezvousing with an upper stage in orbit. Upper stages that were considered included the Transtage, {{the second stage of}} a Titan II, four different types of Centaur, including the S-V variant developed for the Saturn I, the Agena-D, an enlarged Agena, and two Agenas burning in parallel. Either a Titan or Saturn IB would have been used to launch the upper stage, whilst the Gemini <b>would</b> <b>launch</b> on the Titan II, as it had in the Gemini program.|$|E
5|$|An early {{plan for}} STS-8, {{released}} in April 1982, had scheduled it for July 1983. It {{was expected to}} be a three-day mission with four crew members, and <b>would</b> <b>launch</b> INSAT-1-B, an Indian satellite, and TDRS-B, a NASA communications relay satellite. However, following problems with the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) used to deploy TDRS-A on the STS-6 mission, it was announced in May 1983 that the TDRS {{was not going to be}} flown. It was replaced in the manifest by the Payload Flight Test Article. After re-development of the IUS, TDRS-B was eventually re-manifested for the STS-51-L mission, and was lost along with the Space Shuttle Challenger and its crew when the launch failed in January 1986.|$|E

5|$|During the campaign, Mugabe survived two {{assassination}} attempts. In the first, {{which took}} place on 6 February, a grenade was thrown at his Mount Pleasant home, where it exploded against a garden wall. In the second, on 10 February, a roadside bomb exploded near his motorcade as he left a Fort Victoria rally. Mugabe himself was unharmed. Mugabe accused the Rhodesian security forces of being responsible for these attacks. In an attempt to quell the possibility that Rhodesia's security forces <b>would</b> <b>launch</b> a coup to prevent the election, Mugabe met with Peter Walls, the commander of Rhodesia's armed forces, {{and asked him to}} remain in his position {{in the event of a}} ZANU-PF victory. At the time Walls refused.|$|E
5|$|In January 2012, two German stone-conservation experts spent {{ten days}} at the site {{analyzing}} the temples and making recommendations to ensure their long-term preservation. In June, Germany agreed to contribute $130,000 to UNESCO for {{the second phase of}} rehabilitation, in which six experts in stone conservation, microbiology, structural engineering and chemical engineering would spend a week in Borobudur in June, then return for another visit in September or October. These missions <b>would</b> <b>launch</b> the preservation activities recommended in the January report and would include capacity building activities to enhance the preservation capabilities of governmental staff and young conservation experts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} period, the Sicilian Muslims also {{established}} footholds in the Italian mainland. The Muslims {{were asked to}} assist the beleaguered Duchy of Naples against Sicard of Benevento in 839, but then they sacked Brindisi and, following Sicard's murder and the outbreak of {{civil war in the}} Principality of Benevento, seized Tarentum in 840 and Bari in 847, which they made their bases. Until well into the 880s, the Muslims <b>would</b> <b>launch</b> destructive raids along the coasts of Italy and into the Adriatic Sea from their bases on the Italian mainland — most notably from the Emirate of Bari, until its destruction in 871.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon's plan envisaged {{that the}} Allies would throw many troops to envelop his right flank {{in order to}} cut the French {{communication}} line from Vienna. As a result, the Allies' centre and left flank would be exposed and become vulnerable. To encourage them to do so, Napoleon abandoned the strategic position on the Pratzen Heights, faking the weakness of his forces and his own caution. Meanwhile, Napoleon's main force was to be concealed in a dead ground opposite the Heights. According to the plan, the French troops would attack and recapture the Pratzen Heights, then from the Heights they <b>would</b> <b>launch</b> a decisive assault {{to the center of}} the Allied army, cripple them, and encircle them from the rear.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo {{announced}} on February 21, 2006 that New Super Mario Bros. <b>would</b> <b>launch</b> for the Nintendo DS on May 7, 2006. The game's new power-ups were also introduced {{at the same}} time, including the Blue Koopa Shell and the Mega Mushroom. Nintendo further mentioned that the game would be played in 2D but use 3D models to create a 2.5D look and feel. The May 7 release was later delayed towards May 21, but the game's release date was eventually pushed back slightly to May 15; Nintendo also planned to release it {{around the same time}} that the Nintendo DS Lite launched, on June 11, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Saladin went to Alexandria in 1171–72 {{and found}} himself facing the dilemma of having many {{supporters}} in the city, but little money. A family council was held there by the Ayyubid emirs of Egypt where {{it was decided that}} al-Muzaffar Taqi al-Din Umar, Saladin's nephew, <b>would</b> <b>launch</b> an expedition against the coastal region of Barqa (Cyrenaica) west of Egypt with a force of 500 cavalry. In order to justify the raid, a letter was sent to the Bedouin tribes of Barqa, rebuking them for their robberies of travelers and ordering them to pay the alms-tax (zakat). The latter was to be collected from their livestock.|$|E

5|$|Spain thus {{became a}} target for the Anglo-Dutch-Austrian alliance. The confederates' {{campaign}} was pursued by land and by sea. The main land offensive was pursued in the Low Countries by the Duke of Marlborough, while naval forces {{under the command of}} Admiral Sir George Rooke harassed French and Spanish shipping in the Atlantic. In 1703, Marlborough devised a plan under which his forces <b>would</b> <b>launch</b> a surprise attack against the French and their Bavarian allies in the Danube basin while Rooke carried out a diversionary naval offensive in the Mediterranean. Rooke was instructed to attack French or Spanish coastal towns, though the choice of target was left to his discretion.|$|E
5|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{accounts of}} {{who was the first}} choice for the role of the itinerant prostitute, Suzy. By some accounts, Rodgers and Hammerstein attempted to get Julie Andrews, only to find that she had just signed a two-year contract to appear in a musical by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, tentatively titled My Lady Liza. Andrews's role, as Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady, <b>would</b> <b>launch</b> her to stardom. Another candidate was Janet Leigh, whom Rodgers admired greatly, but the actress proved to be unavailable. The producers settled on Judy Tyler, auditioned after Rodgers spotted her on television while watching The Howdy Doody Show, in which she appeared as Princess Summerfall Winterspring.|$|E
5|$|Although the LVII Panzer Corps was reluctantly {{released}} to Army Group Don, by Army Group A, the 17th Panzer Division was ordered {{back to its}} original area of concentration, and did not prepare {{to go back to}} Army Group Don until 10 days after it had been asked for. In light of the troubles in building up sufficient forces, and seeing that the Soviets were concentrating more mechanization on the Chir River, Manstein decided to launch Operation Winter Storm using the 4th Panzer Army. Manstein hoped that the 6th Army <b>would</b> <b>launch</b> an offensive of its own, from the opposite side, upon the receipt of the code signal Thunderclap. Manstein was gambling on Hitler accepting that the only plausible method to avoid the demise of the 6th Army was allowing it to break out, and assumed that General Paulus would agree to order his forces to escape the Stalingrad pocket. On 10 December, Manstein communicated to Paulus that the relief operation would commence in 24 hours.|$|E
