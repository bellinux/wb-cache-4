We knew all along that it was going to be the first song on the album, so we were trying to work out the little intro piece. Lyrically, it came together at the same time that I found out I was going to be a dad, so it's basically about the insecurities of being a father and bringing a child into the world especially since it was during that time when there were all those kids killing each other in school. I couldn't help but think, [...] "Oh my God, have I really screwed up here?"

40|$|While {{living in}} Shanghai last year, Jacob Dreyer found himself {{working as a}} 证婚人 [zhenghunren] {{in one of the}} city’s many wedding facilities. Translated as “wedding officiant,” “priest for weddings,” or “wedding witness,” zhenghunrenhas no real {{equivalent}} in the West. The role involves leading the wedding ceremony, but {{there is no need for}} a zhenghunren to be certified or authorized to perform weddings — which is one reason Dreyer was able to slip into the position so easily. Shanghai, September 2009. It was the time of year when it was just beginning to be crisp. At a party at night, you got your jacket off of the couch when you went outside to smoke. My friend M. and I stood on a balcony gazing into an endless sea of lights, building sites, and peasants maneuvering bicycles between it all. “I’m going back to Australia for a bit, to register my business … I was <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do me a favor,” he said, giving me a cigarette. It didn’t take much time for us to adjust to Chinese habits; while we were foreign, we were also two 20 -year-olds come to the big city to make our fortunes, and naturally adapted to accepting the proffered cigarettes, and to doing strange favors for devious motives, so I naturally agreed without hearing what it was. “Meet me at People’s Square metro tomorrow at 2,” he said, and we went back inside. The next day, both of our faces, slightly stubbled, had the strange dry feeling that a face does the day after drinking, a dehydration not yet compensated for. We exchanged a few words, but were mostly silent as we went deep into Pudong, a region I typically avoided; for me, Pudong is the most repulsive area of Shanghai. Lujiazui is one thing, but the endless, Houstonian landscapes make me fear that modern Chinese people are learning to fear each other as much as we have long done in the USA. At Deping Road, line 6, we got off, and walked onto a highway only sparsely populated with traffic. A typical Pudongnese vista; some tacky hotels and other glistening buildings here and there, hardware stores, various individuals selling fried bread, tangerine peels on the sidewalk — and, a château? A chintzy building, with a sign that declared (ungrammatically) it to be the Villa D’Roman — we pushed through gates and found ourselves in a reception room, featuring a table laid with cookies, lychees, and soft drinks; a hubbub of chatting middle-aged people dressed in clothing that was simultaneously formal yet vulgar. M. brusquely went into a room to the side and got a black folder, and explained, “I marry people here, each time for 500 RMB. I give this speech,” indicating the characters with pinyin underneath in his book, “and then that’s it. It’s really easy, good money — watch me, so when I leave, you can do it. ...|$|E

For decades individuals and scholars have been stumped trying to determine a key indicator for predicting stock market volatility. In this study the daily closing prices for the copper spot market were used to see if it has historically led the S&P 500. By using technical analysis techniques on a 5, 10, and 15 year chart of the copper spot market and the S&P 500 solid conclusions were able to come to light. Sixty six percent of the time over the past 15 years the spot market for copper has led the S&P 500. Key trends were also identified to foretell that the S&P 500 might experience a market correction in the near future while also giving us a price floor for copper prices. These are strong indicators, which if followed, could allow an organization to improve their bottom line and/or give them the potential to make a profit from future market fluctuations...|$|R
