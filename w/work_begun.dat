5|$|The cathedral {{was already}} in severe {{structural}} decline {{by the beginning of}} the 17th century. Restoration <b>work</b> <b>begun</b> by Inigo Jones in the 1620s was halted at the time of the English Civil War (1642–1651). Sir Christopher Wren was attempting another restoration in 1666 when the cathedral was destroyed in the Great Fire of London. At that point, the old structure was demolished, and the present, domed cathedral was erected on the site, with an English Baroque design by Wren.|$|E
5|$|A statewide {{referendum}} on the ballot that day continued the <b>work</b> <b>begun</b> by the new city charter in asking voters to consolidate {{the city and county}} governments in Philadelphia. In 1854, all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County had been consolidated into one city, but many county offices still existed, duplicating the efforts of city officials. The merger would also bring county offices under the civil service protections of the new city charter. Merging the city and county governments had been defeated in a 1937 referendum, but in 1951 the question was overwhelmingly approved. Two other ballot proposals authorized the city to borrow $17 million for municipal improvements and $14 million for the gas works; both passed by a five-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|Live at the BBC, {{the first}} {{official}} release of unissued Beatles performances in seventeen years, appeared in 1994. That same year McCartney, Harrison and Starr collaborated on the Anthology project. Anthology {{was the culmination of}} <b>work</b> <b>begun</b> in 1970, when Apple Corps director Neil Aspinall, their former road manager and personal assistant, had started to gather material for a documentary with the working title The Long and Winding Road. Documenting their history in the band's own words, the Anthology project included the release of several unissued Beatles recordings. McCartney, Harrison and Starr also added new instrumental and vocal parts to two songs recorded as demos by Lennon in the late 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Settling in the {{transitional}} area between agricultural lands and the steppe, the Khitans became semi-sedentary like their Xianbei predecessors of the Northern Wei, {{and started to}} use Chinese methods of defence. In 1026 walls were built through central Manchuria north of Nong'an County to {{the banks of the}} Songhua River. When the Jurchens, once Liao vassals, rose up to overthrow their masters and established the Jin dynasty, they continued Liao's wall-building activities with extensive <b>work</b> <b>begun</b> before 1138. Further wall construction took place in 1165 and 1181 under the Jin Emperor Shizhong, and later from 1192 to 1203 during the reign of his successor Emperor Zhangzong.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of the {{redevelopment}} involved the demolition of the North Stand, the concreting of all terraces and the building a block of turnstiles around the upper section of the East Terrace. This <b>work,</b> <b>begun</b> in October 1981 and completed in 1986, reduced the capacity to 74,370 and cost £3 million. A second phase had been planned to begin in 1988, but the release of the Taylor Report caused the plans to be redrawn and the proposed costs escalated to £25 million. Scotland hosted the 1989 FIFA Under-16 World Cup, with the Scots contesting the final against Saudi Arabia at Hampden.|$|E

25|$|Excavation <b>work</b> <b>begun</b> by Engel was {{concentrated}} on Unit I who also eventually partially rebuilt {{some of the}} walls. This building was revisited by Quilter in 1984, who also conducted excavations in Units II and IV, {{as well as several}} locations outside structures.|$|E
25|$|Bruce Henderson, {{founder of}} the Boston Consulting Group, wrote about {{the concept of the}} {{experience}} curve in 1968, following initial <b>work</b> <b>begun</b> in 1965. The experience curve refers to a hypothesis that unit production costs decline by 20–30% every time cumulative production doubles. This supported the argument for achieving higher market share and economies of scale.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{completion}} of the plan approval process for this section in November 2002, <b>work</b> <b>began</b> with the building of an access road {{to the site of}} the north portal in December 2002.

25|$|Early in 1907 Picasso began {{a strange}} large {{painting}} depicting women, fruit and drapery, which he left unfinished. It cannot be called other than unfinished, {{even though it}} represents {{a long period of}} <b>work.</b> <b>Begun</b> {{in the spirit of the}} works of 1906, it contains in one section the endeavors of 1907 and thus never constitutes a unified whole.|$|E
25|$|As {{the city}} {{attempted}} {{to mediate the}} dispute, Hunkin-Conkey officials accused the union of featherbedding. The city proposed that since flipping a light switch was not a professional skill, that the late-night worker should only be barred from completing <b>work</b> <b>begun</b> during the day. This solution proved acceptable to the union, and workers returned to the site on August 5.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, Shoemaker {{founded the}} 'Faith at Work' {{movement}} (later called LUMUNOS and Moral Re-Armament {{in the years}} immediately preceding World War II) out of his passion for personal witness in the workplace.

25|$|Genesis {{explains}} circumcision as {{a covenant}} with God given to Abraham, but some scholars reject the historicity of these accounts and look elsewhere for {{the origin of}} Jewish circumcision. One explanation, dating from Herodotus, is that the custom was acquired from the Egyptians, possibly {{during the period of}} enslavement. A competing hypothesis, based on linguistic/ethnographic <b>work</b> <b>begun</b> in the 19th century, suggests circumcision was a common tribal custom among many Semitic tribes, including Jews, Arabs and Phoenicians.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{expansion}} {{took place}} in the British American colonies. The Pennsylvania Hospital was founded in Philadelphia in 1751 as a result of <b>work</b> <b>begun</b> in 1709 by the Religious Society of Friends. A portion of this hospital was set apart for the mentally ill, and the first patients were admitted in 1752. Virginia is recognized as the first state to establish an institution for the mentally ill. Eastern State Hospital, located in Williamsburg, was incorporated in 1768 under the name of the “Public Hospital for Persons of Insane and Disordered Minds” and its first patients were admitted in 1773.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the last}} ten years, the {{national}} and international stages have drastically changed. People across North America and the world are divided by religion, race, politics and economics. A divided world needs the unifying voice of Christ. But the voice of Christ, {{if it is to}} properly convey its healing power, demands the unity of His Church here and across the globe. The <b>work</b> <b>begun</b> ten years ago must continue and be brought to fruition. As long as there are those who hear and do the word of the Lord in North America, the message of Ligonier will not be silenced.|$|E
