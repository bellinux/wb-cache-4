5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on May16 and crossed Central America into the Pacific Ocean on May24. That day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring an area of disturbed weather about 150mi (240km) southwest of the Costa Rican coastline. At that time, this system <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> monsoon trough embedded within the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Despite being disorganized, gradual development of this system was anticipated by the NHC. On May25, a broad low pressure area formed southwest of Nicaragua, after the tropical wave interacted with an eastward-moving Kelvin wave. Convection soon became organized around the newly formed low, and the NHC noted that the formation of a tropical cyclone within the subsequent 48hours was likely. The NHC estimated that Tropical Depression Two-E developed at 1200UTC on May28 about 125mi (205km) south-southeast of Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca.|$|E

Despite the satellite presentation, the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression at 1800UTC on August31. Over the next few days, the system organized and curved towards the west from its initial northerly track. At 1200UTC on September2, the JMA upgraded the small depression to tropical storm intensity. Within Saomai, convection deepened near the center, signifying continued intensification. A cold central dense overcast eventually developed, and at 1200UTC the next day, Saomai became a severe tropical storm. Early on September4, the tropical cyclone intensified further into a typhoon. At the time, Saomai was still well northeast of Guam.|$|E
40|$|Background Dermoscopically, one of {{the most}} common {{findings}} in melanocytic lesions is a globular pattern. A regular globular pattern is a common finding in naevi. Melanoma can also show <b>a</b> globular pattern, <b>with</b> globules typically irregular in size, colour and distribution. Objectives To investigate the likelihood of diagnosing melanoma according to distinct dermoscopic and confocal aspects. Methods Dermoscopic and confocal aspects of 83 excised melanocytic lesions dermoscopically showing globules were analysed. Results Our study population included 39 acquired melanocytic naevi, 16 Spitz naevi and 28 melanomas. Univariate analysis showed that regular distribution of globules on dermoscopy <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> ninefold lower risk for melanoma, whereas <b>an</b> irregular distribution <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> almost 10 -fold increased risk for melanoma. Concerning confocal features, dense nests <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fivefold lower risk for melanoma, whereas loosely arranged nests <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> almost sixfold risk for melanoma; moreover, the presence of round cells <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 17 -fold lower risk for melanoma, whereas pleomorphic cells <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> almost 16 -fold risk for melanoma. Conclusions So that melanoma is not missed, clinicians should carefully analyse globular lesions in adults, focusing, in particular, on the distribution of globules and on the presence of confocal cytological atypia...|$|R
