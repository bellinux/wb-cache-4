500|$|So {{this song}} is about me {{basically}} saying that just because {{all of those things}} are there [...] doesn't mean that there is not sort of the same person underneath. And then, also that these veils, they are really just protecting me from the thing that I held the most sacred, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> creativity ... My Aura is the way that I deal with my insanity and I feel quite insane, so this song sounds very insane ... Everyone thinks that everything I do is a statement but some times I'm just moved by something passionate and I want to express it.|$|E
500|$|Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a {{positive}} review, {{stating that the}} reveal was [...] "an effective narrative, and one which creates a [...] "satisfying" [...] resolution for the viewer {{as well as the}} character. Veronica Mars {{has done a good job}} of subverting expectations on a regular basis, but it’s still a TV show, with requirements for satisfying resolutions. [...] <b>Which</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> roundabout way of saying that while I wasn’t surprised by the reveal that it was Duncan Kane, I was impressed by how well it worked up to that point. It had to be Duncan or someone totally irrelevant and shocking." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A+", its fourth such rating for the series, after [...] "An Echolls Family Christmas", [...] "Clash of the Tritons", and [...] "M.A.D.".|$|E

2500|$|Ernest Hemingway, an American author, died by suicide {{shortly after}} ECT at the Mayo Clinic in 1961. He is {{reported}} to have said to his biographer, [...] "Well, what is the sense of ruining my head and erasing my memory, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> capital, and putting me out of business? It was a brilliant cure but we lost the patient...." [...] American surgeon and award-winning author Sherwin B. Nuland is another notable person who has undergone ECT. [...] In his 40s, this successful surgeon's depression became so severe that he had to be institutionalized. After exhausting all treatment options, a young resident assigned to his case suggested ECT, which ended up being successful. Author David Foster Wallace also received ECT for many years, beginning as a teenager, before his suicide at age 46.|$|E
2500|$|Hossain wrote a {{wide variety}} of poems in lucid {{language}} and with innovative and suggestive imagery. Expressiveness and eloquence in his poetry came from his successful, spontaneous combination of national and world heritage and mythology with his personal experience and feelings. Though he began to write when postmodernism was blooming fast in the west, he denies to identify himself as an avowed post-modernist. In his book On Behula's Rafts launch ceremony, [...] he said about himself that [...] "my soul is nourished by the alluvial soil and the moistures of riverine Bangladesh, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> Behula". Fakrul Alam considered his poems [...] "humorous and witty" [...] in some cases. Syed Manzoorul Islam opined that Hossain at his initial stage was a romantic poet, but is now a realistic poet, as he is writing in a very self-conscious way. His love poems are characterised by stark realism rather than by romantic euphoria. Anisuzzaman deemed his poetry as the socio-political representation of Bangladesh. He explored not only the contemporary social and political condition of his country but also [...] "the grounds of existential philosophy in conceiving human life as fragile yet undying, as self-destructive yet eternal".|$|E

2500|$|Clinton was {{conflicted}} {{whether she}} {{wanted to take the}} position or remain in the Senate, and agonized over her decision. While the Senate leadership had discussed possible leadership positions or other promotions in rank with her even before the cabinet position became a possibility, nothing concrete had been offered. The prospect of her ever becoming Senate Majority Leader seemed dim. A different complication was Bill Clinton; she told Obama: [...] "There's one last thing that's a problem, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> husband. You've seen what this is like; it will be a circus if I take this job", making reference to the volatile effect Bill Clinton had had during the primaries. In addition, there was a specific concern whether the financial and other involvements of Bill Clinton's post-presidential activities would violate any conflict-of-interest rules for serving cabinet members. There was as well considerable media speculation about what effect taking the position would have on her political career and any possible future presidential aspirations. Clinton wavered over the offer, but as she later related, [...] "But, you know, we kept talking. I finally began thinking, look, if I had won and I had called him, I would have wanted him to say yes. And, you know, I'm pretty old-fashioned, and it's just who I am. So {{at the end of the}} day, when your president asks you to serve, you say yes, if you can." [...] Chief of Protocol of the United States Capricia Penavic Marshall, who had known Clinton since her First Lady days, later confirmed the same rationale: [...] "When asked to serve, she does. And her president asked." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hex said, [...] "It takes {{a week of}} {{long hours}} and hard work to put {{together}} a review on the show. Gaming, capturing all the game footage, logging all the footage, writing the review, re-writing, editing, filming, re-editing... the finished product is something I'm really proud of." [...] Bajo described the editing process as [...] "a bit like Machinima". Both he and Hex checked edits remotely during the period of the week when they had finished their filming {{and the rest of the}} crew [...] "shoot field stories and finish off the rest of the show". Hex said that during the playing of games and filming she became quite attached to her avatars and wanted to show off what her own character did. Hex says, [...] "We've tried our best on the show to present both sides of the argument in any stories we've done". Bajo explained: [...] "Mondays we finish of reviews, log footage, swap games, read scripts and sub everything after a production meeting, Tuesdays we make GG and GG: Pocket, Wednesdays are GGSP and any green screen stuff, then Hex and I are off to review for the rest of the week, while the gang shoot field stories and finish off the rest of the show. We check edits remotely usually <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>my</b> favourite part of the job. changes week to week but that's the general schedule" [...] Bajo has stated that [...] "often segment ideas are pretty spontaneous". When asked about taking on Good Game: Spawn Point as well as the original show, Bajo responded: [...] "we're busier than ever, but we've got things down to a pretty tight production schedule now".|$|E
