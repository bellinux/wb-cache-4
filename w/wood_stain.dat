50|$|A stain is a {{discoloration}} {{that can}} be clearly distinguished from the surface, material, or medium it is found upon. They are caused by the chemical or physical interaction of two dissimilar materials. Staining is used for biochemical research, metal staining, and art (e.g., <b>wood</b> <b>staining,</b> stained glass).|$|R

5000|$|Varnish is a transparent, hard, {{protective}} finish or {{film that}} is primarily used in wood finishing {{but also for}} other materials. Varnish is traditionally {{a combination of a}} drying oil, a resin, and a thinner or solvent. Varnish finishes are usually glossy but may be designed to produce satin or semi-gloss sheens by the addition of [...] "flatting" [...] agents. Varnish has little or no color, is transparent, and has no added pigment, as opposed to paints or <b>wood</b> <b>stains,</b> which contain pigment and generally range from opaque to translucent. Varnishes are also applied over <b>wood</b> <b>stains</b> as a final step to achieve a film for gloss and protection. Some products are marketed as a combined stain and varnish.|$|R

It is no longer necessary to visit a retail location to select the unique wood and stain combination desired; this can all be done on the Internet, and there are dozens of different <b>wood,</b> <b>stain</b> and upholstery options to choose from. The finished {{furniture is}} shipped directly from the stain shop to the consumer.|$|E
50|$|His new {{technique}} {{was first used}} {{in the case of}} two murdered and dismembered children in the town of Göhren on the Baltic island of Rügen. The suspect in the case, Ludwig Tessnow claimed that the stains on his clothing were either cattle's blood or <b>wood</b> <b>stain</b> from a carpentry project. They were able to prove otherwise. Tessnow was executed for his crime in 1904. Uhlenhuth was nominated 40 times for the Nobel Prize in Medicine between 1910 and 1952, notably by Nobel laureate Karl Landsteiner.|$|E

50|$|There can be {{intentional}} <b>stains</b> (such as <b>wood</b> <b>stains</b> or paint), indicative stains (such as {{food coloring}} or adding a substance to make bacteria visible under a microscope), natural stains (such as rust on iron or a patina on bronze), and accidental stains such as ketchup on a shirt.|$|R
50|$|Around {{this time}} Stephens {{continued}} to instruct {{his son in}} the preparation of inks and <b>wood</b> <b>stains</b> in his outhouses at Grove House in Finchley in a sort of apprenticeship. The experience would prove invaluable when young Henry later went to work in his father's factory. Henry Charles married, in 1863, Agnes Mackereth, the daughter of his father's old friend at medical school.|$|R
5000|$|... 1851 was {{the year}} of the Great Exhibition in London's Hyde Park. Stephens' {{indelible}} [...] "blue-black writing fluid" [...] and other inks received favourable press reviews and the company's <b>wood</b> <b>stains</b> for oak, mahogany and walnut were used on the doors and panels of the Exhibition buildings. The Prince Consort, visiting early one morning, was reported to be much impressed by the results.|$|R
50|$|A <b>wood</b> <b>stain</b> {{consists}} of colorants dissolved and/or suspended in a 'vehicle' or solvent. Vehicle {{is the preferred}} term, as {{the contents of a}} stain may not be truly 'dissolved' in the vehicle, but rather 'suspended', and thus the vehicle may not be a true 'solvent'. The vehicle often may be water, alcohol, a petroleum distillate, or a finishing agent such as shellac, lacquer, varnish and polyurethane. Colored or 'stained' finishes do not typically deeply penetrate the pores of the wood and may largely disappear when the finish deteriorates or is removed.|$|E
5000|$|Blem was a S. C. Johnson & Son {{brand of}} wax {{furniture}} refinishing compound introduced in 1955. The original Blem product {{came in a}} red toothpaste-type tube with BLEM in white lettering. The product was launched in a give-away special offer with a free tube of Blem packed with a can of Pride polish. The red tube was later switched to yellow toothpaste-tube type packaging with BLEM in dark brown lettering, and the byline [...] "Rubs out scars on furniture permanently". The product had dark and light <b>wood</b> <b>stain</b> variants.|$|E
50|$|Siding stain is one {{variety of}} <b>wood</b> <b>stain</b> with very high {{viscosity}} (others {{can be quite}} thin). Effectively, siding stains are paints that do not cover as well and do not form a hard film. They are designed to penetrate better and contain binders that are softer and more flexible, allowing them to last longer than harder, more brittle paints. Siding stain protects against solar radiation especially UV radiation, water, fungus including mildew, and insects. Different siding stains are distinguished by the appearance they impart to wood. Certain solvent-based or oil-based siding stains contain small amounts of paraffin wax, which cannot be painted over, although re-staining is still possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Forester, [...] "for, if a cane {{is made of}} any <b>wood</b> <b>stained</b> black, after a {{time the}} wood itself wears away farther than the {{staining}} had penetrated. Then the fresh wood will come to view. So that, if you want anything black, it is much better to make it of a wood which is black all the way through.|$|R
40|$|Three {{independent}} {{studies were}} conducted in Australia and Spain to {{examine the effect of}} water and temperature stress on the development of Eutypa dieback of grapevines. In Adelaide, South Australia, ‘Red Grenache’ vines in pots were inoculated with Eutypa lata and subjected to various temperature and soil water regimes, then assessed for foliar symptoms, <b>wood</b> <b>staining</b> and colonization by the fungus. Vines subjected to a combination of heat or cold plus low or high soil moisture displayed more severe foliar symptoms, the most severe occurring on vines subjected to the hottest (30 °C) and wettest (20 – 40 % soil water content) conditions. <b>Wood</b> <b>staining</b> was not related to foliar symptom severity or to the temperature and moisture combination. Furthermore, there was no relationship between staining and mycelial growth, indicating that staining may not be an accurate reflection of the spread of E. lata. In Cabrils, Spain, ‘Tempranillo’ vines were subjected to water stress in pots and showed a significant reduction in shoot diameter growth, stomatal conductance and leaf water potential. Inoculation with E. lata also decreased the leaf water potential of stressed vines. <b>Wood</b> <b>staining</b> in inoculated vines was similar irrespective of watering treatment. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the relationship between stress and growth of E. lata in infected vines. Field experiments in two climatically different regions (Barossa Valley and Riverland) of South Australia suggested that water-stressed vines in a warm, dry environment may be more susceptible to infection of pruning wounds by E. lata than vines receiving standard watering. </p...|$|R
50|$|In 1955, a wing {{was added}} to this {{building}} to accommodate the increasing enrollment due {{to the number of}} school district consolidations that were happening during this time. The wing included new classrooms for the teaching of business education, home economics, agriculture and English. This addition is prominent, as the original building was done in dark stain and the addition was <b>wood</b> <b>stained</b> in blond.|$|R
50|$|Stain is {{composed}} of the same three primary ingredients as paint (pigment, solvent (or vehicle), and binder) but is predominantly vehicle, then pigment and/or dye, and lastly {{a small amount of}} binder. Much like the dyeing or staining of fabric, <b>wood</b> <b>stain</b> is designed to add color to the substrate (wood and other materials) while leaving some of the substrate still visible. Transparent varnishes or surface films are applied afterwards. In principle, stains do not provide a durable surface coating or film. However, because the binders are from the same class of film-forming binders that are used in paints and varnishes, some build-up of film occurs.|$|E
5000|$|Treatments for saltillo include: coating {{them with}} a surface sealant prior to {{grouting}} (as mentioned earlier), applying an admixture of linseed oil and paint thinner, applying natural stone colour enhancers, applying floor hardeners, applying shine, painting {{them with a}} water-based paint, coating them with <b>wood</b> <b>stain,</b> etc. As the tile is incredibly porous it will readily absorb just about any liquid. Please note any of these treatments may be used on the tile, however some of them such as penetrating sealeant, enhancers or linseed oil treatments penetrate into the tile and may affect the ability of later coatings {{to adhere to the}} tile. Ultra-durable, water-based polyurethane makes an excellent coating for adding slip resistance, beautiful appearance and protection from penetrating stains. Look for a polyurethane coating that has no VOCs for maximum environmental friendliness.|$|E
50|$|Black walnut drupes contain juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), plumbagin (yellow quinone pigments), and tannin. These {{compounds}} cause walnuts {{to stain}} cars, sidewalks, porches, and patios, {{in addition to}} the hands of anyone attempting to shell them.The brownish-black dye was used by early American settlers to dye hair. According to Eastern Trees in the Petersen Guide series, black walnuts make a yellowish-brown dye, not brownish-black. The apparent confusion is easily {{explained by the fact that}} the liquid (dye) obtained from the inner husk becomes increasingly darker over time, as the outer skin darkens from light green to black. Extracts of the outer, soft part of the drupe are still used as a natural dye for handicrafts.The tannins present in walnuts act as a mordant, aiding in the dyeing process, and are usable as a dark ink or <b>wood</b> <b>stain.</b>|$|E
50|$|The primary {{method of}} stain {{formation}} is surface stains, where the staining substance is spilled {{out onto the}} surface or material and is trapped in the fibers, pores, indentations, or other capillary structures on the surface. The material that is trapped coats the underlying material, and the stain reflects back light according to its own color. Applying paint, spilled food, and <b>wood</b> <b>stains</b> are of this nature.|$|R
50|$|When {{applied in}} coats over wood, Danish oil cures to a hard satin finish that resists liquid well. As the {{finished}} coating is not glossy or slippery, it is a suitable finish for {{items such as}} food utensils or tool handles, giving some additional water resistance and also leaves a dark finish to the wood. Special dyed grades are available if <b>wood</b> <b>staining</b> is also needed.|$|R
50|$|It {{is used in}} {{cellulose}} ester lacquers, particularly of the brushing type, where it produces brilliant gloss and hard film and where its lack of odor is desirable. It is used in lacquer thinners, dopes, <b>wood</b> <b>stains,</b> <b>wood</b> preservatives and printing pastes; in coating compositions for paper and textiles; permanent markers; in making artificial silk and leather; in imitation gold leaf; in celluloid cements; as a preservative for animal tissue; in metal cleaning compounds; {{in the manufacture of}} photographic film; and in hydraulic brake fluids, where it is usually mixed with an equal volume of castor oil.|$|R
