5|$|A {{percentage}} {{of each group}} working in less contaminated areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical total exposure <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>for</b> each person who did not have a personal badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E

2500|$|The {{very first}} {{generation}} computational phantoms {{were developed to}} address the need to better assess organ doses from internally deposited radioactive materials in workers and patients. [...] Until the late 1950s, the ICRP still used very simple models. In these calculations, each organ of the body {{was assumed to be}} represented as a sphere with an [...] "effective radius". The radionuclide of interest was assumed to be located {{at the center of the}} sphere and the [...] "effective absorbed energy" [...] <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>for</b> each organ. Phantoms such as the Shepp-Logan Phantom were used as models of a human head in the development and testing of image reconstruction algorithms. However, scientists attempted to model individual organs of the body and ultimately the entire human body in a realistic manner, the efforts of which led to stylized anthropomorphic phantoms that resemble the human anatomy.|$|E

60|$|This personage seemed {{stricken}} in years. He wore {{a scarlet}} cloak, buttoning high upon his face, and his hat was unlooped and slouched, probably {{by way of}} defence against the weather. His horse, a strong and steady palfrey, <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>for</b> a rider who proposed to witness the sport of the day rather than to share it. An attendant waited at some distance, and the whole equipment was that of an elderly gentleman of rank and fashion. He accosted Ravenswood very politely, but not without some embarrassment.|$|E

That is nothing to me. My reasons are because it tied up the French to open the door to our manufactures at a certain duty of importation there, and left the parliament of Britain at liberty to shut theirs out by as high duties as they pleased here, there being no limitation upon us as to duties on French goods; but that other nations should pay the same.|$|E

60|$|Still {{there was}} no {{apparent}} approach of danger. The drums had almost ceased beating, and as I reached the Carrousel, {{on my way back}} to the Rue St. Dominique, I saw nothing in the streets to justify all this alarm, which was either the result of a panic, or <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>for</b> political effect; artifice acting on apprehension. A few people were beginning to collect on the bridges and quays, and there was evidently a greater movement towards the Pont Neuf, than in the lower parts of the town. As I crossed the Pont Royal, a brigade of light artillery came up the quays from the Ecole Militaire, the horses on the jump, and the men seated on the carriages, or mounted, as belongs to this arm. The noise and hurry of their passage was very exciting, and it gave an impulse to the shopkeepers of the Rue du Bac, most of whom now began to close their windows. The guns whirled across the bridge, and dashed into the Carrousel, on a gallop, by the guichet of the Louvre.|$|E
60|$|The consternation was general, and it {{required}} {{the efforts of}} both the Lord Keeper and Ravenswood to keep Lucy from fainting. Thus was the Master a second time engaged in the most delicate and dangerous of all tasks, that of affording support and assistance to a beautiful and helpless being, who, as seen before in a similar situation, had already become a favourite of his imagination, both when awake and when slumbering. If {{the genius of the}} house really condemned a union betwixt the Master and his fair guest, the means by which he expressed his sentiments were as unhappily chosen {{as if he had been}} a mere mortal. The train of little attentions, absolutely necessary to soothe the young lady's mind, and aid her in composing her spirits, necessarily threw the Master of Ravenswood into such an intercourse with her father as <b>was</b> <b>calculated,</b> <b>for</b> the moment at least, to break down the barrier of feudal enmity which divided them. To express himself churlishly, or even coldly, towards an old man whose daughter (and SUCH a daughter) lay before them, overpowered with natural terror--and all this under his own roof, the thing was impossible; and by the time that Lucy, extending a hand to each, was able to thank them for their kindness, the Master felt that his sentiments of hostility towards the Lord Keeper were by no means those most predominant in his bosom.|$|E

60|$|He bade me observe it, and I {{should always}} {{find that the}} calamities of life were shared among {{the upper and lower}} part of mankind, but that the middle station had the fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay, they were not {{subjected}} to so many distempers and uneasinesses, either of body or mind, as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and extravagances on the one hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distemper upon themselves by the natural consequences of their way of living; that the middle station of life <b>was</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>for</b> all kind of virtue and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way men went silently and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head, not sold to a life of slavery for daily bread, nor harassed with perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest, nor enraged with the passion of envy, or the secret burning lust of ambition for great things; but, in easy circumstances, sliding gently through the world, and sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without the bitter; feeling that they are happy, and learning by every day’s experience to know it more sensibly.|$|E
