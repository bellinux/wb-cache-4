5|$|The inquest into Sandra Rivett's death {{opened on}} 13November 1974 and {{was led by}} the Coroner for Inner West London, Gavin Thurston. Two {{witnesses}} were called to the courtroom, which <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> reporters; Roger Rivett, who confirmed that he had identified his wife's body, and the pathologist, Keith Simpson, who confirmed that Rivett had died from being hit {{on the head with}} a blunt instrument. At Ranson's request, the hearing was then adjourned. Further adjournments were made on 11December 1974 and 10March 1975, before a full inquest was scheduled for 16June 1975.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{her four}} funnels were removed, and the forward two were cut {{at an angle}} to {{resemble}} those of a German destroyer. The bow <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> 4.5 tons of high explosives, which were set in concrete. It was decided that the explosive charge would be timed to detonate after the raiders had left the harbour. To prevent the Germans towing her away, the crew would open the ship's seacocks before abandoning the ship. Should she become disabled or sunk before getting to the dock, four motor launches had been detailed to take off the crew and put the commandos ashore. The charge would be reset to explode after the last boat had left.|$|E
5|$|For Thanksgiving 1988, {{his family}} spent the holiday with him, {{although}} he had developed neuropathy and was increasingly bed-ridden and reliant on morphine; he died in his bed on December 16, 1988 {{at the age of}} 41. Sylvester had planned his own funeral, insisting that he be dressed in a red kimono and placed in an open-top coffin for the mourners to see, with his friend Yvette Flunder doing his corpse's makeup. He wanted Tracy to sing at his funeral, accompanied by choirs and many flowers. The whole affair took place in his church, the Love Center, with a sermon being provided by Reverend Walter Hawkins. The event <b>was</b> <b>packed,</b> <b>with</b> standing room only, and the coffin was subsequently taken and buried at his family's plot in Inglewood Park Cemetery. An album titled Immortal was posthumously released; it contained Sylvester's final studio recordings, and was compiled by Marty Blecman.|$|E

5|$|Goldfinger was premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 17 September 1964, {{with general}} release in the United Kingdom the {{following}} day. Leicester Square <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> sightseers and fans and police {{were unable to}} control the crowd due {{to the number of}} people. A set of glass doors to the cinema was accidentally broken and the premiere was shown ten minutes late because of the confusion. The United States premiere occurred on 21 December 1964, at the DeMille Theatre in New York. The film opened in 64 cinemas across 41 cities and eventually peaked at 485 screens. Goldfinger was temporarily banned in Israel because of Gert Fröbe's connections with the Nazi Party. The ban, however, was lifted many years later when a Jewish family publicly thanked Fröbe for protecting them from persecution during World War II.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October 1959 the Admiralty {{announced}} that Vanguard would be scrapped, {{as she was}} considered obsolete and too expensive to maintain. She was decommissioned on 7 June 1960 and sold to the Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain for £560,000. On 4 August 1960, when the ship {{was scheduled to be}} towed from Portsmouth to the breaker's yard at Faslane, Scotland, the whole of the Southsea sea front <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> people who came to see her off. As Vanguard was being towed towards the harbour entrance, she slewed across the harbour and ran aground near the Still & West pub. She was pulled off by five tugboats an hour later, and made her final exit from Portsmouth. Five days later she arrived at Faslane, and by mid-1962 the demolition process was complete; she was the last British battleship to be scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The 17th Infantry Brigade was {{the last}} to land in Greece, {{arriving}} at Piraeus on 12April. Savige was placed in charge of Savige Force, consisting of the 2/5th, 2/6th, 2/7th and 2/11thInfantry Battalions, with armour, artillery, engineer and other support. He was given the mission of covering the Allied flank around Kalabaka. On 17April, Savige received orders to withdraw from Kalabaka, leaving only a rearguard behind. The road behind him, however, <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> vehicles, and a crucial bridge on the only reasonably good road back had accidentally been demolished. Savige elected to disregard his orders and hold his position until the road was clear. He then managed to withdraw, although his driver's foot was broken in an air raid. Savige arrived back in Palestine on 1May 1941 and began the task of rebuilding his brigade. For the campaign in Greece, he received his fourth mention in despatches.|$|E

5|$|The Maya leader {{returned}} {{the following day}} with twelve canoes, as promised. The Spanish could see from afar that the shore <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> natives. The conquistadors put ashore in the brigantine and the ships' boats; {{a few of the}} more daring Spaniards boarded the native canoes. The Spanish named the headland Cape Catoche, after some words spoken by the Maya leader, which sounded to the Spanish like cones catoche. Once ashore, the Spaniards clustered loosely together and advanced towards the city along a path among low, scrub-covered hillocks. At this point the Maya leader gave a shout and the Spanish party was ambushed by Maya warriors armed with spears, bows and arrows, and stones. Thirteen Spaniards were injured by arrows in the first assault, but the conquistadors regrouped and repulsed the Maya attack. They advanced to a small plaza bordered by temples upon the outskirts of the city. When the Spaniards ransacked the temples they found a number of low-grade gold items, which filled them with enthusiasm. The expedition captured two Mayas to be used as interpreters and retreated to the ships. Over the following days the Spanish discovered that although the Maya arrows had struck with little force, the flint arrowheads tended to shatter on impact, causing infected wounds and a slow death; two of the wounded Spaniards died from the arrow-wounds inflicted in the ambush.|$|E

25|$|The {{state in}} which Gregory became pope in 590 was a ruined one. The Lombards held {{the better part of}} Italy. Their predations had brought the economy to a standstill.

The seat of government was far from Rome in Constantinople, which appeared unable to undertake the relief of Italy. The pope had sent emissaries, including Gregory, asking for assistance, to no avail.|$|E
25|$|This {{new system}} of {{government}} became increasingly unpopular very quickly.

25|$|The general {{impression}} was that, {{as much as}} the senate <b>was</b> <b>packed</b> <b>with</b> men devoted to the royal couple and the government obtained a large majority at the general elections, King Alexander would not hesitate any longer to proclaim Queen Draga's brother as the heir presumptive to the throne. In spite of this, it had been agreed with the Serbian Government that Prince Mirko of Montenegro, who was married to Natalija Konstantinovic, the granddaughter of Princess Anka Obrenović, an aunt of King Milan, would be proclaimed heir-presumptive in the event that the marriage of King Alexander and Queen Draga was childless.|$|E
