Javier and Salazar's efforts begin to cripple the Obregón brothers' cocaine outfit, but Javier soon discovers Salazar is a pawn for the Juárez Cartel, the rival of the Obregón brothers. That entire portion of the Mexican anti-drug campaign is a fraud, as Salazar is <b>wiping</b> <b>out</b> one cartel because he has aligned with another for profit.|$|E
5|$|Between 1975 and 1990, real {{per capita}} income fell by more than 20%, <b>wiping</b> <b>out</b> almost three decades of {{economic}} development. The manufacturing industry, which had experienced a period of uninterrupted growth until the mid-1970s, began a process of continuous decline. The extreme dependence on state support of the many protected industries exacerbated the sharp fall of the industrial output. The degree of industrialization {{at the start of}} the 1990s was similar to its level in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|BioWare {{considered}} {{not making}} Tali a squadmate in Mass Effect 3. Some writers, such as Weekes, felt passionately about her inclusion, which {{led the team}} {{to believe that the}} players could share his passion. Preston Watamaniuk, lead designer for the Mass Effect series, found Tali's death in 3 was the toughest for him to plan, though felt it needed to be possible due to the option of <b>wiping</b> <b>out</b> the quarians.|$|E

The assault, however, ends in catastrophe when the nuclear device suddenly detonates, <b>wiping</b> <b>out</b> most of the city along with everyone in it.|$|E
5|$|One such {{community}} was Linn City (originally named Robin’s Nest). Settled in 1843 by Robert Moore, Robert himself built four flour and lumber mills {{along the banks}} of the Willamette. Warehouses, homes, and mills were steadily added until 1861, when a fire destroyed several of the buildings. Efforts at rebuilding the small town entirely ceased when the Great Flood of 1862 struck, <b>wiping</b> <b>out</b> the remaining buildings.|$|E

5|$|Spanish Florida and the English Province of Carolina {{were each}} {{subjected}} to attacks from the other, and the English engaged the French based at Mobile {{in what was}} essentially a proxy war involving primarily allied American Indians on both sides.

5|$|After the US Open, del Potro {{played in}} the Davis Cup {{semifinal}} against Serbia, winning both of his rubbers against Janko Tipsarević and world No. 1 Novak Djokovic.

5|$|In 1996, Railly gives {{a lecture}} about the Cassandra complex {{to a group}} of scientists. At the post-lecture book signing, Dr. Peters points out to Railly that apocalypse alarmists {{represent}} the sane vision, while humanity's gradual destruction of the environment is the real lunacy. Cole arrives at the venue after seeing flyers publicizing it, and when Railly departs, he kidnaps her and forces her to take him to Philadelphia. They learn that Goines is the founder of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, and set out in search of him. When they confront him, however, Goines denies any involvement with the group and says that in 1990 Cole originated the idea of <b>wiping</b> <b>out</b> humanity with a virus stolen from Goines' virologist father.|$|E

On 10 June, the battalion advanced on the right of the 7th Brigade's line, capturing the German front line trenches around Morlancourt and <b>wiping</b> <b>out</b> a whole battalion, taking 325 prisoners for the loss of 400 men. On 4 July the battalion undertook a supporting role in the successful Australian attack at Hamel, following up the initial success with a further, albeit small, advance on 8 July. After the German offensive petered out, the 27th Battalion undertook peaceful penetration operations against the German line as the Allies began to prepare to launch their own offensive.|$|E

Bhrigu {{continues}} teaching and collates his knowledge in a book called Bhrigu Samhita. Sati's death is not forgotten and she is later renowned as Goddess Shakti, and her ashes are spread throughout India, in places later known as Shakti Peethas (Seat of Shakti). It is revealed that {{in order to ensure that}} the Somras is not mass-manufactured again, the course of the Yamuna is turned towards the east, thus drying up the Saraswati River.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the eighth}} series in 1999, Doug Naylor has been {{attempting}} to make a feature-length version of the show. A final draft of the script was written, by Naylor, and flyers began circulating around certain websites. The flyer was genuine and had been distributed by Winchester Films to market the film overseas. Plot details were included as part of the teaser. It was set in the distant future where Homo sapienoids - a race of cyborgs— had taken over the solar system and were <b>wiping</b> <b>out</b> the human race. Spaceships that tried to escape Earth were hunted down until only one remained... Red Dwarf.|$|E
5|$|The First World War {{badly damaged}} the {{remaining}} duck industry in Buckinghamshire, <b>wiping</b> <b>out</b> the small scale producers and {{leaving only a}} few large farms. Disruption caused by the Second World War further damaged the industry. By the 1950s only one significant flock of Aylesbury ducks remained in Buckinghamshire, and by 1966 there were no duck-breeding or -rearing businesses of any size remaining in Aylesbury itself. Although {{there is only one}} surviving flock of pure Aylesbury ducks in the United Kingdom and the breed is critically endangered in the United States, the Aylesbury duck remains a symbol of the town of Aylesbury, and appears on the coat of arms of Aylesbury and on the club badge of Aylesbury United.|$|E

5|$|The {{brunt of}} the {{tropical}} cyclone's damage was inflicted upon coastal areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal. A total of 6,240people were killed {{as a result of}} the storm, with 5,708in Bangladesh and 538in West Bengal. Many of the deaths were a result of the destruction of homes or electrocution after strong winds toppled power poles across the region. Along the coast of Bangladesh, strong storm surge caused heavy infrastructure damage and contributed in <b>wiping</b> <b>out</b> an estimated 70% of all harvestable Bangladeshi crops, with an estimated 200,000tonnes (220,000tons) of crops being lost. Widespread power outages cut telecommunications across Bangladesh; in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital city, debris-laden streets paralyzed traffic while electrical outages caused water shortages.|$|E
5|$|The small {{geographic}} {{ranges of}} the sea otter populations in California, Washington, and British Columbia mean a single major spill could be catastrophic for that state or province. Prevention of oil spills and preparation to rescue otters if one happens is a major focus for conservation efforts. Increasing the size and range of sea otter populations would also {{reduce the risk of}} an oil spill <b>wiping</b> <b>out</b> a population. However, because of the species' reputation for depleting shellfish resources, advocates for commercial, recreational, and subsistence shellfish harvesting have often opposed allowing the sea otter's range to increase, and there have even been instances of fishermen and others illegally killing them.|$|E
5|$|When Macdonald {{returned}} to Nova Scotia in 1945, {{he was only}} 55, but the silver-haired politician now seemed 20years older. After the retirement of Premier A. S.

Less than two months later, Macdonald's Liberals swept the province <b>wiping</b> <b>out</b> the Conservatives {{for the first time}} since Confederation and winning all but two Cape Breton ridings where voters elected members of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF, the forerunner of the present-day New Democratic Party, or NDP. In spite of his huge victory, a close colleague noted that Macdonald was not the same man he had been before he left Nova Scotia in 1940. He had trouble making decisions, not because he was a procrastinator, but because he was not well.|$|E
