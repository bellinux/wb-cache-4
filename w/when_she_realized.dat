25|$|Moss {{performed}} the shots featuring Trinity {{at the beginning}} of the film and all the wire stunts herself. The rooftop set that Trinity uses to escape from Agent Brown early in the film was left over from the production of Dark City, which has prompted comments due to the thematic similarities of the films. During the rehearsal of the lobby scene, in which Trinity runs on a wall, Moss injured her leg and was ultimately unable to film the shot in one take. She stated that she was under a lot of pressure at the time and was devastated <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> that she would be unable to do it.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Abdul {{appeared}} {{as one of}} three judges for the reality television music competition show American Idol. Abdul, along with fellow judges Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson, evaluated thousands of amateur contestants {{in their ability to}} sing. Abdul won praise as a sympathetic and compassionate judge. She seemed especially kind compared to fellow judge Simon Cowell, who was often blunt in his appraisals of the contestants' performances. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> that Cowell's over-the-top judging style was heartbreaking for many young contestants, Abdul was so horrified that she considered leaving the show. Although their differences often resulted in extremely heated on-air exchanges and confrontations, Cowell says he {{played a major role in}} convincing Abdul not to leave the show.|$|E
25|$|The {{music for}} Radiant Historia {{was written by}} Yoko Shimomura, a {{composer}} {{best known for her}} work on the Kingdom Hearts series and Legend of Mana. Shimomura acted as sole composer and arranger for the score. Shimomura was first contacted about working on the project via email, and was shocked <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> who had sent it, at first thinking it was a prank. When creating the score, Shimomura used her usual technique of matching the score to imagery provided by the production team. Due to the game's themes of time travel and its darker side, the score was predominantly sombre in tone. As the game was unconnected to any previous intellectual property, Shimomura found composing the score far easier than most of her other projects.|$|E
25|$|During the Russo-Swedish War (1788–90), Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte {{entered into}} politics. Sweden's ally France was displeased about the war, and Gustav III {{gave her the}} task to act as the go-between in his {{negotiations}} with the French ambassador. In cooperation with {{the daughter of the}} ambassador, her friend Camille du Bois de la Motte, she handled the correspondence between the monarch and the ambassador, arranged secret meetings between them and acted as witness to them upon the King's request. This caused a rift between her and the King <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> that she had in fact been used to distract the ambassador. Adolf Fredrik Munck later blackened her {{in the eyes of the}} King by claiming that France was informed about the Swedish war plans through her friendship with Camille du Bois de la Motte. Knowing that her correspondence was read, she maintained a secret correspondence through her own net of couriers.|$|E

500|$|Lhermitte's last {{victim was}} her eldest daughter, Yasmin. The mother called over Yasmin {{and told her}} she had a {{surprise}} for her, just like she had done with Myriam. Lhermitte attacked Yasmin from behind as she entered the office, but Yasmin was able to dodge the knife by diving to the ground. After a struggle in which Yasmin suffered multiple stab wounds, Lhermitte stabbed her in the back and slashed her throat. With her children dead, Lhermitte then attempted to kill herself by falling on her knife. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> that the wound would not be fatal, she wrote [...] "call the police" [...] in red marker on her door and called emergency services to the house. Investigators found the four children tucked in their beds, some with stuffed toys in their arms.|$|E
500|$|McKenna {{recalls that}} she kept {{expanding}} it to suit Streep and Frankel, {{but even a}} few days before it was scheduled to be filmed she was unsure if it would be used or even shot. She was revising it at a nearby Starbucks <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> that Miranda would describe something not as just blue—chosen as the color for Andy's sweater since it would work best on screen—but would instead use an exact shade. From a list of shades McKenna sent, Streep picked cerulean; the final speech takes up almost a page of the script, long for a mainstream film. [...] "I was like, it'd be cool if half of that ended up in the movie," [...] the writer says. [...] "Every word is in the movie." [...] The references to past designer collections are entirely fictional, McKenna explains, since the speech was written around the sweater's color (however, the Huffington Post later pointed out, designers often take their fashion inspiration from the streets).|$|E

I Am... World Tour features performances from Beyoncé's tour. She explained {{that the idea of}} filming her worldwide performances came <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> that she was feeling lonely, stating [...] "there was one moment I was in China and I was in this huge suite and I {{looked out the window and}} there were just thousands of people walking and I couldn't believe my life... I guess I was a bit lonely and I wanted to talk to someone so I opened up my computer and I just talked." [...] Additionally, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side.

500|$|... "Galentine's Day" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez said, [...] "The show {{managed to}} cram more character development into 22 minutes than I thought possible. Almost every couple {{had a major}} milestone of sorts last night." [...] Gonzalez complimented the acting of Aziz Ansari during his moments with Wendy, and praised the [...] "touching moment" [...] between Ron and Leslie <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>realized</b> she had to break up with Justin. Steve Kandell of New York magazine appreciated that Leslie was correct about Frank, and that Justin was the ignorant one. Kandell said the senior dance served as a [...] "poignant backdrop" [...] for the episode's romantic subplots, but said the most intriguing show's relationship is between Leslie and Ron. Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, said the episode was funny, but focused more attention on advancing various romantic subplots. Sepinwall said the scenes about Ann and Mark were [...] "a nice reaction to the general blandness of that relationship", but found it [...] "frustrating" [...] that the episode left the reason for Wendy and Tom's resolution unclear in [...] "Galentine's Day".|$|E
500|$|After the wedding, Cane {{recalled}} {{a phone call}} he had with his [...] "Uncle Langley" [...] regarding their con with Jill and Katherine. Afterward, Langley was revealed to be the long deceased Phillip Chancellor III in June 2009; Cane was in fact not Jill's son but someone hired by Phillip. Lily and Cane separated upon this revelation, but soon reunited upon her diagnosis with ovarian cancer. Her uterus was taken out during surgery, but the doctors were able to harvest two of her eggs; they decided {{to start a family}} with Mackenzie Browning (Clementine Ford) acting as their surrogate mother. Browning became pregnant with twins. Afterward, an immigration officer arrested Cane and planned to deport him, as he was not truly Phillip. Since he was present for the birth of his children, Charlie and Mattie in June 2010 and helped Lily overcome cancer he was not deported. Cane was then blackmailed by the crime family he turned to in Australia, and embezzled money from Tucker McCall's (Stephen Nichols) company with the help of Sofia Dupre (Julia Pace Mitchell). Cane's biological father, Colin Atkinson (Tristan Rogers), then came to Genoa City in December 2010 to help Blake Joseph blackmail Cane. Colin then became engaged to Jill much to Cane's dismay. Cane then tried to stop their wedding but was shot in the chest by Blake on the church steps; he died afterward, leaving Lily devastated. Lily then began believing she was receiving afterlife messages from Cane and sought professional help. After seeing Cane several times, Lily realized he wasn't a figment of her imagination; it was then revealed in May 2011 that the man shot at the church wasn't Cane, but his identical twin brother, Caleb, who was scheming with Colin to kidnap Charlie and Mattie. However, Cane continued to act as Caleb to stop the plot with Colin and later his mother, Genevieve (Genie Francis).
