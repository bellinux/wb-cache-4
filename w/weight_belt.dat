25|$|How {{to impact}} the {{underside}} of the surface ice if the diver's <b>weight</b> <b>belt</b> falls off for any reason and the diver ascends uncontrollably and rapidly.|$|E
25|$|The diver can use {{a weight}} harness, {{integrated}} weight buoyancy control device, or a <b>weight</b> <b>belt</b> with two buckles on it so the weights can not be accidentally released which would cause a run-away ascent into the ice sheet.|$|E
25|$|Surface-supplied divers often {{carry their}} weights {{securely}} attached {{to reduce the}} risk of accidentally dropping them during a dive and losing control of their buoyancy. These may be carried on a <b>weight</b> <b>belt</b> with a secure buckle, supported by a weight harness, connected directly to the diving safety harness, or suspended from the corselet of the helmet. Heavily weighted boots may also be used to stabilise the diver in an upright position.|$|E
25|$|<b>Weight</b> <b>belts</b> are {{the most}} common {{weighting}} system currently in use for recreational diving. <b>Weight</b> <b>belts</b> are often made of tough nylon webbing, but other materials such as rubber can be used. <b>Weight</b> <b>belts</b> for scuba and breathhold diving are generally fitted with a quick release buckle to allow the dumping of weight rapidly in an emergency.|$|R

25|$|These are weights which {{attach to}} the harness directly, but are {{removable}} by disengaging the clip mechanism. They {{can also be used}} to temporarily increase the weight of a conventional <b>weight</b> <b>belt.</b> Various sizes have been available, ranging from around 0.5 to 5kg or more. The larger models are intended as ditchable primary weights, and are used in the same way as BCD integral weights or weight harness weighs, but clipped to the backplate or sidemount harness webbing, and the smaller versions are also useful at trim weights.|$|E
25|$|Tank bottom weights {{provide a}} much shorter lever arm, so {{need to be}} a much larger {{proportion}} of the total ballast, but do not interfere with propulsive efficiency the way ankle weights do. There are not really any other convenient places below the <b>weight</b> <b>belt</b> to add trim weights, so the most effective option is to carry the main weights as low as necessary, by using a suitable harness or integrated weight pocket buoyancy compensator which actually allows the weights to be placed correctly, so {{there is no need for}} longitudinal trimming.|$|E
25|$|After a {{successful}} approach, negatively buoyant {{objects such as}} a <b>weight</b> <b>belt</b> are removed. The priority is then to transport the person to the water's edge in preparation for removal from the water. The person is turned on their back with a secure grip used to tow from behind. If the person is cooperative they may be towed {{in a similar fashion}} held at the armpits. If the person is unconscious they may be pulled in a similar fashion held at the chin and cheeks, ensuring that the mouth and nose are well above the water.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: Using a <b>weight</b> lifting <b>belt</b> when {{performing}} {{a variety of}} resistance exercises {{is becoming more and}} more common. The purpose of using a <b>weight</b> lifting <b>belt</b> is its supposed ability to reduce compressive forces on the lumbar spine and enhancement of athletic performance. Although the <b>weight</b> lifting <b>belt</b> has been proven to increase the intra abdominal pressure that helps reduces the shear forces during a squat, little is known about the <b>weight</b> lifting <b>belts</b> effect on the performance. Studies have suggested that wearing a <b>weight</b> lifting <b>belt</b> during a squat can increase the vertical velocity and range of motion. Few studies have focused on the power output, but improvements have been seen while wearing a <b>weight</b> lifting <b>belt</b> when {{performing a}} deadlift. Variables such as power, velocity and range of motion are of importance for an athlete when making individual training plans as well as measuring the progress. Therefore more research is needed to identify the actual influence of the <b>weight</b> lifting <b>belt</b> on the performance. Aim: The purpose of this study was to examine if <b>weight</b> lifting <b>belts</b> have an impact on an athletes ability to develop power, velocity or improve range of motion in a squat. Methods: Fifteen healthy men and women familiar with the squat exercise participated in the study. During the study they performed six repetitions of the squat divided into two sets, one set without a <b>weight</b> lifting <b>belt</b> and one with a <b>weight</b> lifting <b>belt.</b> Power and velocity were measured during every squat with a linear encoder and videotapes were made to later calculate the angles in the hip- and knee joints at the lowest position of the exercise. Results: No significant differences were found in power (p = 0. 25) or concentric and eccentric velocity (p = 0. 61, p = 0. 16) with or without a <b>weight</b> lifting <b>belt.</b> Range of motion in the knee joint was greater when not wearing a <b>weight</b> lifting <b>belt</b> (p = 0. 03), but no differences in the hip angles were found (p = 0. 70). Conclusion: The result from the current study shows that when performing a squat the <b>weight</b> lifting <b>belt</b> has little to no effect on power, velocity or range of motion. Although a noticeable change in range of motion of the knee joint were observed, further studies on larger populations are needed to determine if it is of clinical value. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{position}} of the centre of buoyancy is largely {{beyond the control of}} the diver, though the cylinder(s) may be shifted in the harness by a small amount, and the volume distribution of the buoyancy compensator has a large influence when inflated. Most of the control of trim available to the diver is in the positioning of ballast weights. The main ballast weights therefore should be placed as far as possible to provide an approximately neutral trim, which is usually possible by wearing the weights around the waist or just above the hips on a <b>weight</b> <b>belt,</b> or in weight pockets provided in the buoyancy compensator jacket or harness for this purpose. Fine tuning of trim can be done by placing smaller weights {{along the length of the}} diver to bring the centre of gravity to the desired position. There are several ways this can be done.|$|E
25|$|In free diving (breathhold) {{the weight}} system is almost {{exclusively}} a <b>weight</b> <b>belt</b> with quick release buckle, as the emergency {{release of the}} weights will usually allow the diver to float to the surface even if unconscious, where {{there is at least}} a chance of rescue. The weights are used mainly to neutralise the buoyancy of the exposure suit, as the diver is nearly neutral in most cases, and there is little other equipment carried. The weights required depend almost entirely on the buoyancy of the suit. Most free divers will weight themselves to be positively buoyant at the surface, and use only enough weight to minimise the effort required to swim down against the buoyancy {{at the start of a}} dive, while retaining sufficient buoyancy at maximum depth to not require too much effort to swim back up to where the buoyancy becomes positive again. As a corollary to this practice, freedivers will use as thin a wetsuit as comfortably possible, to minimise buoyancy changes with depth due to suit compression.|$|E

2500|$|Weight belts for surface {{supplied}} diving {{are usually}} provided with buckles {{which can not}} accidentally be released, and the <b>weight</b> <b>belt</b> is often worn under the jacket harness.|$|E
2500|$|A weight harness usually {{consists}} of a belt around the waist holding pouches for the weights, with shoulder straps for extra support and security. Often a velcro flap holds the weights in place. They have handles, which must be pulled to drop the weights in an emergency [...] or to remove the weights when exiting the water. A weight harness allows the weights to be comfortably carried lower on the body than a <b>weight</b> <b>belt,</b> which must be high enough to be supported by the hips. This is an advantage for divers who have no discernible waist, or whose waist is too high to trim correctly if a <b>weight</b> <b>belt</b> is worn. These advantages may also be available on some styles of integrated BC weights. A weight harness may also incorporate a crotch strap or straps to prevent weight shift if the diver is in a steep head down posture.|$|E

50|$|BC {{attachment}} {{systems are}} generally intended {{to limit the}} shifting of the BC {{as a result of}} the lifting forces, including minimizing the tendency to slide towards the head when the diver is upright while the bladder is inflated. If the diver is wearing a <b>weight</b> <b>belt,</b> this will pull in the opposite direction to BC lift when the diver is upright, and can result in the diver sagging down in the jacket when floating at the surface. Solutions to this problem include the cummerbund (a broad adjustable waist band) and the crotch strap (a strap between the legs). The crotch strap, when adjusted correctly, is effective at preventing this shift, but may prevent the <b>weight</b> <b>belt</b> from falling clear of the diver if dropped in an emergency. Fitting the <b>weight</b> <b>belt</b> over the crotch strap after putting the BC on can be difficult. The cummerbund is an attempt to avoid this problem, as the <b>weight</b> <b>belt</b> can not be snagged on it in the same way, but the <b>weight</b> <b>belt</b> must then be worn either under the cummerbund, obstructing access to the buckle, or below the cummerbund. The effectiveness of a cummerbund depends on a waistline which is smaller than the circumference of the upper torso, and it may constrain free breathing if fitted too tightly.|$|E
