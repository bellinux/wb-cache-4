5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{also played}} a role in the discussion of a number of the executives. While mindful of tyranny, delegates of the Constitutional Convention thought that the single executive <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> in responding to national disturbances.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test, {{playing as}} an opening batsman, he struck 19 {{in the first}} innings. Australia's new post-war skipper Warwick Armstrong felt that Macartney <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> at number three, {{and in the second}} innings, he made a {{free-flowing}} 69 in a 111-run second-wicket stand with Herbie Collins as Australia went on to inflict a 377-run defeat. Macartney's return to form was interrupted by an illness, which caused him to miss the following three Test matches. After a two-month layoff, Macartney struck 130 in a match for his state against England.|$|E
5|$|Albizu Campos {{had been}} {{corresponding}} with 34-year-old Lebrón from prison and chose {{a group of}} nationalists who included Rafael Cancel Miranda, Irvin Flores and Andres Figueroa Cordero to attack locations in Washington, D.C. Upon receiving the order she communicated it to {{the leadership of the}} Nationalist party in New York and, although two members unexpectedly disagreed, the plan continued. Lebrón decided to lead the group, even though Albizu Campos did not order her to directly take part in the assault. She studied the plan, determining the possible weaknesses, concluding that a single attack on the House of Representatives <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective.</b> The date for the attack on the House of Representatives was to be March 1, 1954. This date was chosen because it coincided with the inauguration of the Conferencia Interamericana (Interamerican Conference) in Caracas. Lebrón intended to call attention to Puerto Rico's independence cause, particularly among the Latin American countries participating in the conference.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Monaco sent scout Arnold Catalano {{to watch}} Henry, {{then at the}} age of 13 in a match. Henry scored all six goals as his side won 6–0. Catalano asked him to join Monaco without even {{attending}} a trial first. Catalano requested that Henry complete a course at the elite Clairefontaine academy, and despite the director's reluctance to admit Henry due to his poor school results, he was allowed to complete the course and joined Arsène Wenger's Monaco as a youth player. Subsequently, Henry signed professional forms with Monaco, and made his professional debut on 31 August 1994, in a 2–0 loss against Nice. Although Wenger suspected that Henry should be deployed as a striker, he put Henry on the left wing because he believed that his pace, natural ball control and skill <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> against full backs than centre-backs.|$|E
5|$|In late 1964 the RAN {{sought the}} Government's {{approval}} to upgrade Melbourne and purchase {{a force of}} 18 Skyhawks and 16 Trackers. The Skyhawks were intended {{to be used to}} provide air defence for the fleet as well as to attack warships and targets on land. While the Naval Board saw maritime strike as being a logical task for the FAA, the RAAF argued that the 24 General Dynamics F-111C aircraft it had ordered <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> in this role. Cabinet agreed to the proposal to modernise the carrier and acquire Trackers in November 1964, but delayed a decision on the Skyhawks at that time. Following further lobbying and staff work by the Navy, the Government eventually agreed to purchase ten Skyhawks in early 1965 for a cost of £9.2 million. This order comprised eight single-seat fighter aircraft and a pair of two-seat TA-4 Skyhawk trainers. These aircraft were the first newly built Skyhawks to be sold to a country other than the United States.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August, Göring {{read the}} {{reports on the}} losses of 18 August, and unhappy with {{the extent of the}} losses, {{recalled}} both pilots. Hitler's Directive 17 had ordered the Luftwaffe to achieve air superiority, but remain strong enough for when, or rather if, Sea Lion was launched. Moreover, Göring recognised that the Luftwaffe was his power base. A failure would be damaging, but a severe weakening of the Luftwaffe would be far worse. He emphasised to his commanders the need to preserve the Luftwaffe's strength. Essentially, the core theme of the conference was fighter protection. The fighter leaders advocated sweeps to clear the skies in advance of attacks. Other commanders present thought a combination of sweeps and close escort <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> in reducing losses. Göring agreed and listed a number of forms that the sweeps could take. The most important tactical change he made was instituting a wholesale purge of older Geschwaderkommodore in favour of younger men. From now on, leaders were to be drawn from the ranks, given responsibility based on skill and experience rather than rank, while allowing them to have a free rein in tactical engagements (a form of aerial Auftragstaktik).|$|E

2500|$|The Mattapan-Ashmont {{trolley line}} of the MBTA serves Mattapan {{as well as several}} bus routes. [...] In the {{beginning}} of 2016, the Mattapan trolley was in danger of being derailed and being transformed into bus routes instead; which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> cost <b>effective</b> than keeping the trolley as rail line., However, Boston officials have fought to cancel this transformation because although this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> cost <b>effective,</b> property values would decrease and would [...] "most importantly, torpedo a mixed-use, mixed-income residential-retail project slated for the Mattapan station parking lot". [...] At this point in time, the project to convert the Trolley into buses will not be carried out.|$|R
25|$|What is more, if {{such weapons}} were {{developed}} by both superpowers, they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> against the U.S. than against the USSR, as the U.S. had far more regions of dense industrial and civilian activity as targets for large weapons than the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Angola had no {{confidence}} {{that a new}} president <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> than Kabila and feared that continued fighting {{would lead to a}} power vacuum that could only help UNITA.

25|$|In 1975, the U.N. General Assembly adopted resolutions {{endorsing}} {{the desirability of}} replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty and dissolving the UNC. This was followed by North Korean attempts to start peace discussions with the U.S. The U.S. however believed influencing China to restrict North Korean actions <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective.</b>|$|E

25|$|Hawkins was {{determined}} that his navy, as well as having the best fleet of ships in the world, would also have the best quality of seamen. He petitioned and won a pay increase for sailors, arguing that {{a smaller number of}} well-motivated and better-paid men <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> than a larger group of uninterested men.|$|E
25|$|In addition, tram {{advocates have}} {{suggested}} that the new rapid transit services (metro to City, Butovo light metro, Monorail) <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> as at-grade tram lines and that the current problems with trams are only due to poor management and operation, not the technical properties of trams. New tram models have been developed for the Moscow network despite the lack of expansion.|$|E

Pro-Awami columnist Syed Badrul Ahsan defends its actions, but acknowledges [...] "it <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> and effectual, <b>more</b> properly indoctrinated {{in the spirit of}} the 1971 war, history <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> different." ...|$|R
40|$|Benefit {{recipients}} are often portrayed negatively by {{politicians and the}} media. But if ‘balancing the books’ is the government’s primary aim, demonising specific groups {{is unlikely to be}} productive. David Binder suggests increasing the housing supply, introducing rent controls and looking into ways to boost incomes to reduce the need for tax credits <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> approach...|$|R

25|$|Kerrigan played 13first-class {{matches in}} his first full season with Lancashire, taking 30wickets {{at an average of}} 32.23 {{including}} three five-wicket hauls. When Keedy returned from injury he and Kerrigan sometimes bowled together in the County Championship. However, their partnership was not initially ideal as they were attempting to out perform each other. After a discussion they decided they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> if they worked together to build pressure while bowling.|$|E
25|$|Dean {{strongly}} {{urged his}} supporters to support Kerry {{as opposed to}} Ralph Nader, arguing that a vote for Nader would only help to re-elect President George W. Bush because he believed that most who vote for Nader {{are likely to have}} voted for Kerry if Ralph Nader was not running. Dean argued that Nader <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> if he lobbied on election law reform issues during his campaign. Dean supported several election law reform issues such as campaign finance reform, and Instant Runoff Voting.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the years, several {{attempts}} have been made to reduce traffic congestion on Jakarta's main arteries. Implemented solutions include a 'three-in-one' rush-hour law, during which cars with fewer than three passengers are prohibited from driving on the main avenues. Another example is the ban on trucks passing main avenues during the day. In 2016, 'odd-even' policy was introduced which designated cars with either odd or even-numbered registration plates on a particular day. This aims to function as a transitional measure to alleviate traffic congestion until the future introduction of Electronic Road Pricing which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective.</b>|$|E

With increased confidence, teachers <b>would</b> likely <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> at integrating STEM activities. The research seems clear that increased confidence leads to better performance during instruction, and this will lead to gains in student learning (Nadelson et al. 2012; Nadelson et al. 2013).|$|R

25|$|There {{are over}} 100 million street {{children}} worldwide. Most {{of the children}} living in institutions {{around the world have}} a surviving parent or close relative, and they most commonly entered orphanages because of poverty. It is speculated that, flush with money, orphanages are increasing and push for children to join even though demographic data show that even the poorest extended families usually take in children whose parents have died. Experts and child advocates maintain that orphanages are expensive and often harm children's development by separating them from their families and that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> and cheaper to aid close relatives who want to take in the orphans.|$|E
25|$|Bloomberg's successor, Bill de Blasio, {{concurrently}} {{proposed a}} tax on wealthy residents to fund the subway, though a similar tax for universal prekindergarten had previously failed in the state legislature. He also clarified that he opposed Cuomo's plan because his Pre-K tax <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective</b> in raising money. De Blasio's opposition came as some of his supporters in the 2017 mayoral election announced support for the plan, including the Working Families Party and Union Local 32BJ. Later in August 2017, it was clarified that de Blasio did not oppose congestion pricing specifically, and that his office was to look at any congestion pricing proposal by Cuomo's administration.|$|E
25|$|Schneerson, {{who had an}} {{intimate}} knowledge of the Soviet government and their tactics, opposed demonstrations on behalf of Soviet Jews, stating that he had evidence that they were harming Russia's Jews. Instead he advocated quiet diplomacy, which he said <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>effective.</b> Schneerson did whatever was {{in his power to}} push for the release of Jews from the former Soviet Union and established schools, communities and other humanitarian resources to assist with their absorption into Israel. On one known occasion he instructed Senator Chic Hecht to provide President Ronald Reagan with contact information of people who wished to leave so that he could lobby their release.|$|E
