50|$|The {{complicity}} of {{the police}} {{is believed to have}} triggered Anini’s reign of terror in 1986. In early 1986, two members of his gang were tried and prosecuted against an earlier under-the-table ‘agreement’ with the police to destroy evidence against the gang members. The incident, and Anini’s view of police betrayal, is believed to have spurred retaliatory actions by Anini. In August, 1986, a fatal bank robbery linked to Anini <b>was</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a police officer (Nathaniel Egharevba)and others were killed. That same month, two officers on duty were shot at a barricade while trying to stop Anini’s car. During a span of three months, he was known to have killed nine police officers.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, due to {{improved}} weather conditions, {{the number of}} mainly African migrants crossing the sea to Italy doubled between February and March, reaching nearly 9,600 in March 2016, compared to 2,283 in March 2015. In April, on the contrary, the number of migrants arriving in Italy (8,370) dropped by 13% compared to the previous month and by 50% compared to the same month in 2015; despite this, Italy exceeded the totals for Greece {{for the first time}} since June 2015. On 16 April, a shipwreck of a large boat between Libya and Italy <b>was</b> <b>reported,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> as many as 500 people may have died, in one of the worst disasters since April 2015.

50|$|In {{the same}} year as the {{discovery}} of the anticancer property, miltefosine was reported by S. L. Croft and his team at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as having antileishmanial effect as well. The compound was effective against Leishmania donovani amastigotes in cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages at a dose of 12.8 mg/kg/day in a five-day course. However, priority was given {{to the development of the}} compound for cutaneous metastases of breast cancer. In 1992 a new research <b>was</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the compound was highly effective in mouse against different life cycle stages of different Leishmania species, and in fact, more potent than the conventional sodium stibogluconate therapy by a factor of more than 600. Results of the first clinical trial in humans were reported from Indian patients with chronic leishmaniasis with high degree of success and safety. This promising development promulgated a unique public-private partnership collaboration between ASTA Medica (later Zentaris GmbH), the WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, and the Government of India. Eventually, several successful Phase II and III trials led to the approval of miltefosine in 2002 as the first and only oral drug for leishmaniasis.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{documented}} case of peduncular hallucinosis was by French neurologist and neuropsychiatrist Jean Lhermitte, which {{described a}} 72-year-old woman’s visual hallucinations [...] The hallucinations occurred during normal conscious {{state and the}} patient’s neurological signs were associated with those characteristic of an infarct to the midbrain and pons. Von Bogaert, Lhermitte’s colleague, named this type of hallucination “peduncular,” {{in reference to the}} cerebral peduncles, {{as well as to the}} midbrain and its surroundings. In 1925, Von Bogaert was the first to describe the pathophysiology of peduncular hallucinosis through an autopsy of a patient. [...] His autopsy revealed the infarction of many areas of the brain including the inferolateral red nucleus, superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray, third nerve nucleus, superior cerebellar peduncle, substantia nigra, and pulvinar. Later in 1932, Lhermitte, Levy, and Trelles discovered an association between peduncular hallucinosis and “pigmentary degeneration of the periaqueductal gray and the degeneration of the occulomotor nucleus.” [...] Posterior thalamic lesions were also found to be linked to peduncular hallucinosis by De Morsier. More recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to localize lesions in the brain characteristic of peduncular hallucinosis. In 1987, the first case of peduncular hallucinosis <b>was</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> MRI was used to locate a midbrain lesion.|$|E

30|$|The PCR {{products}} obtained using B. amyloliquefaciens PSM 3.1 chromosomal DNA as template {{were about}} 1500  bp and other non-specific bands were obtained [32]. Amplification of cellulase gene <b>was</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> sequence specific primers for cellulase genes were used and significant amplification was achieved from the cDNA {{and the corresponding}} bands {{were found in the}} gel [33]. The results of this study may further be exploited for characterization of a recombinant cellulase enzyme after its expression in a suitable host to produce novel cellulases with high efficiency. The biological aspects of processing of cellulosic biomass become the crux of future research involving cellulases and cellulolytic microorganisms. With modern biotechnology tools, especially in the area of microbial genetics, novel enzymes and new enzyme applications will become available for the various industries.|$|E
30|$|The reduced nGO (nrGO) has {{attracted}} great interest especially in PTT [20 – 24] since {{the reduction of}} nGO by removing oxygen-containing groups {{can result in a}} dramatic increment in NIR absorption. Toxic chemical reducing reagents, such as sodium borohydride, hydrazine, and its derivatives, are usually used to reduce nGO. Although the nrGO produced by chemical reduction methods have high conductivity and C/O ratio, the intense agglomeration and the residual toxic reduction reagent limit its bioapplication [20, 21, 25, 26]. Recently, some green strategies have been developed to produce soluble nrGO. Natural extracts like green tea, gelatin, and spinach leaf can act as both the green reduction reagents and functionalization reagents [23, 27 – 29]. Strong alkaline and alcohols were also utilized to reduce nGO [30, 31]. In addition, a ‘water-only’ green reduction route to produce graphene by hydrothermal dehydration under high temperature of 180 °C <b>was</b> <b>reported,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the overheated supercritical (SC) water in sealed container acted as reducing agent [32].|$|E

And, it exhibited the maximum current efficiency of 33. 1 cd/A, the turn-on voltage at about 3 V and the maximum luminance in excess of 20000 cd/m 2. More important, it realized very stable white-light emission, and its CIE(x, y) coordinates only shift from (0. 34, 0. 37) to (0. 33, 0. 37) as applied voltage increased from 5 V to 12 V. It is believed that the new scheme in emission layer of white-light OLED can fine tune the contribution of primary emission with applied voltage changed, resulting in high quality white-light OLED...|$|E
40|$|The SeqA protein of Escherichia coli is {{not only}} the main {{negative}} regulator of DNA replication initiation but also a specific transcription factor. It binds to hemimethylated GATC sequences and, with somewhat different specificity, to fully methylated GATC regions. Recently, a microarray analysis <b>was</b> <b>reported,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> transcriptomes of wild-type and ΔseqA strains were compared. Although in the seqA mutant the levels of some transcripts were significantly decreased while certain transcripts were evidently more abundant relative to wild-type bacteria, no correlation between the presence of GATC motifs in promoter sequences and transcription activity was found. However, here we show that when larger DNA fragments, encompassing positions from – 250 to + 250 relative to the transcription start site, are analyzed, some common features of GATC distribution near the promoters activated by SeqA can be demonstrated. Nevertheless, it seems that the GATC pattern is not the only determinant of SeqA-dependence of promoter activity...|$|E
40|$|Zoonotic anatrichosomiasis in {{a mother}} and {{daughter}} is reported. Both presented with a 10 -week history of multiple painful oral ulcers. Biopsy specimens revealed the presence of small, coiled trichuroid nematodes with distinctive morphological fea-tures, including stichocytes and paired bacillary bands. This represents an unusual infection by a zoonotic Anatrichosoma species. CASE REPORT The anatrichosomes are an unusual and poorly known group oftrichuroids that have been reported from primates, marsupi-als, and, rarely, humans, dogs, and cats. The adult worms are small and delicate, and most often they have been reported burrowing in epithelial tissues of skin or mouth or from cutaneous lesions. Be-tween 1960 and 1990, there were three reports of infection in humans with Anatrichosoma, all from cutaneous trails in the skin similar to cutaneous larva migrans (1 – 3), and in 2005, a report of an Anatrichosoma-like worm was reported in a breast nodule (4).
