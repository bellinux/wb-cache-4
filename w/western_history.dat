5|$|The popular movie Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, {{released}} in 1957, starring Burt Lancaster as Earp, cemented {{his place in}} <b>Western</b> <b>history</b> as a hero lawman. The movie also altered the public's perception of cowboys, who in Earp's time and locale were outlaws, but in the movies were reinvented as good guys, assisting the lawmen in their fight against the outlaws.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} well known and for many years {{respected}} books about Wyatt Earp was the book I Married Wyatt Earp, originally credited as a factual memoir by Josephine Marcus Earp. Published in 1976, it was edited by amateur historian Glenn Boyer, and published by the respected University of Arizona Press. It was immensely popular for many years, capturing the imagination of people {{with an interest in}} <b>western</b> <b>history,</b> studied in classrooms, cited by scholars, and relied upon as factual by filmmakers.|$|E

25|$|Numerous <b>Western</b> <b>histories</b> of the Vietnam War, some {{scholars}} argue, tend to assign the Vietnamese a secondary role {{in terms of}} the developments that led to victory by the North. For example, while American combat deaths are often referenced in the large number of <b>Western</b> <b>histories,</b> comparatively little mention is made of the 275,000 combat deaths suffered by the South Vietnamese, almost 5 times the American total. Just the evacuation of Da Nang in March 1975 cost the South Vietnamese an estimated 60,000 deaths, more than total US military losses for the entire conflict.|$|R

5|$|After his expulsion, Soedjatmoko {{moved to}} Surakarta and studied <b>Western</b> <b>history</b> and {{political}} literature, {{which led to}} an interest in socialism. Some figure that affected him besides Karl Marx were Ortega y Gasset and Jan Romein. While in Surakarta he also worked at his father's hospital. After Indonesia proclaimed its independence, Soedjatmoko was asked to become Deputy Head of the Foreign Press Department in the Ministry of Information. In 1946, {{at the request of}} Prime Minister Sjahrir, he and two friends established a Dutch-language weekly, Het Inzicht (Inside), as a counter to the Dutch-sponsored Het Uίtzicht (Outlook). The next year, they launched a socialist-oriented journal, Siasat (Tactics), which was published weekly. During this period Soedjatmoko dropped the name Mangoendiningrat, as it reminded him of the feudal aspects of Indonesian culture.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Marquis was {{spending}} {{a great deal}} of time on his research into the Custer battle. He now had a dozen Cheyenne informants, including Wooden Leg. With them, from June 1928, communicating mainly with sign language or through interpreters, he consulted maps and went on field trips to the battle site. He also corresponded with George Bird Grinnell, Generals Hugh L. Scott and Edward S. Godfrey, and with Custer's widow Elizabeth Custer. He also started loaning out some of his Custer memorabilia for exhibitions. Personal contacts during this period included Laton Alton Huffman, a well-known Montana frontier photographer, W.H. Banfill of the Billings Gazette, who wrote <b>Western</b> <b>history</b> articles, artist and author Will James, and James Willard Schultz, author and explorer.|$|E
5|$|While {{living in}} Vidal, Wyatt and Josie were visited by Billy Breakenridge, the former Tombstone deputy under John Behan. He pressed Wyatt for details about {{his time in}} Tombstone to add to his book Helldorado: Bringing Law to the Mesquite. Breakenridge was {{assisted}} by Western novelist William MacLeod Raine, who since 1904 had published more than 25 novels about <b>Western</b> <b>history.</b> The book was published in 1928 before Wyatt died. It depicted Wyatt as a thief, pimp, crooked gambler, and murderer. Breakenridge wrote that the Earps and Doc Holliday aggressively mistreated the guiltless cowboys until they were forced into a fatal confrontation. His description of the 1881 O.K. Corral gun fight stated that the Clanton and McLaury brothers were merely cowboys who had been unarmed and surrendered but the Earp brothers had shot them in cold blood. Wyatt and Josie protested that the book's contents was biased and more fiction than fact. Earp complained about the book {{until his death in}} 1929, and his wife continued in the same vein afterward.|$|E

25|$|The Protestant missionaries contributed {{much to the}} {{development}} of Western education in Joseon Korea.

25|$|The French Reformer John Calvin (1509–1564) was a {{theological}} writer who produced many sermons, biblical commentaries, letters, theological treatises, and other works.

25|$|Written {{mathematics}} {{began with}} numbers expressed as tally marks, with each tally representing a single unit. The numerical symbols consisted probably of strokes or notches cut in wood or stone, and intelligible alike to all nations. For example, one notch in a bone represented one animal, or person, or anything else. The peoples {{with whom the}} Greeks of Asia Minor (amongst whom notation in <b>western</b> <b>history</b> begins) were likely to have come into frequent contact were those inhabiting the eastern littoral of the Mediterranean: and Greek tradition uniformly assigned the special development of geometry to the Egyptians, {{and that of the}} science of numbers either to the Egyptians or to the Phoenicians.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{until the}} late 20th century {{emphasised}} class conflicts from a largely Marxist perspective as the fundamental driving cause of the Revolution. The central theme of this argument was that the Revolution emerged from the rising bourgeoisie, {{with support from the}} sans-culottes, who fought to destroy the aristocracy. However, Western scholars largely abandoned Marxist interpretations in the 1990s. By the year 2000 many historians were saying that the field of the French Revolution was in intellectual disarray. The old model or paradigm focusing on class conflict has been discredited, and no new explanatory model had gained widespread support. Nevertheless, as Spang has shown, there persists a very widespread agreement to the effect that the French Revolution was the watershed between the premodern and modern eras of <b>Western</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{music of}} Australia has an {{extensive}} history made of music societies. Indigenous Australian {{music is a}} part of the unique heritage of a 40,000–60,000 year history which produced the iconic didgeridoo. Contemporary fusions of Indigenous and Western styles (exemplified in the works of No Fixed Address, Yothu Yindi, Christine Anu and Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu) mark distinctly Australian contributions to world music. During its early <b>western</b> <b>history,</b> Australia was a collection of British colonies, and Australian folk music and bush ballads such as Waltzing Matilda were heavily influenced by Anglo-Celtic traditions, while classical forms were derived from those of Europe. Contemporary Australian music ranges across a broad spectrum with trends often concurrent with those of the US, the UK, and similar nations – notably in the Australian rock and Australian country music genres. Tastes have diversified along with post-World War II multicultural immigration to Australia.|$|E
