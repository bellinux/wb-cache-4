These stations are equipped with <b>water</b> <b>refilling</b> <b>equipment</b> to refill firefighter and rescue trains. One of these stations was proposed as an extremely deep railway station, called Porta Alpina, but that option was eventually rejected on both economical and technical grounds. The completed tunnel was handed over by AlpTransit Gotthard AG to the Swiss government on 31 May 2016. It was formally opened in a ceremony the following day, during which the tunnel was conveyed to its operator, the Swiss Federal Railways (SBBCFFFFS).|$|E

40|$|Background : Water {{is a real}} {{absolute}} {{necessity for}} humans as well as fresh air and healthy food. Result of inspection of drinking <b>water</b> <b>refilling</b> quality in Tegal Regency at 2011 showed the existence of microbiology contamination, from 138 drinking <b>water</b> <b>refilling</b> samples, in which 67 samples (48, 6 %) {{did not meet the}} standard for MPN Coliform and E. coli. The purpose this research was to know microbiological contamination risk factor of drinking <b>water</b> <b>refilling</b> in Tegal Regency. Methods : Design applied was cross-sectional. Independent variable in this research was standard water quality, quality of filtration, quality of desinfection and the dependent variable was water quality drinks product from drinking <b>water</b> <b>refilling</b> station. Population at this research was drinking <b>water</b> <b>refilling</b> station in Tegal Regency which amounts to 197. Sampling in random sampling that sample was taken in random. Test Chi-Square applied to test the relation of microbiology contamination risk factor of drinking <b>water</b> <b>refilling</b> with microbiology quality of product water from drinking <b>water</b> <b>refilling</b> station. Results : The result of inspection of standard water quality, 36 samples (55, 4 %) MPN ineligibility Coliform and 12 samples (18, 5 %) ineligibility Ecoli. Result of inspection of water quality drinks product DAMIU, 32 samples (49, 2 %) MPN ineligibility Coliform and 10 samples (15, 4 %) ineligibility Ecoli. Result of observation quality of filtration, 31 samples (47, 7 %) with quality of filtration is not good. Result of observation quality of desinfeksi, 28 samples (43, 1 %) with quality of desinfeksi is not good. The results of the research showed there was significant association between quality of water microbiology standard (p-value= 0, 0001), quality of filtration (p-value= 0, 0001), quality of desinfection (p-value= 0, 0001) with quality of product water microbiology in drinking <b>water</b> <b>refilling</b> station Tegal Regency at 2012. Product drinking water from drinking <b>water</b> <b>refilling</b> station using ineligible standard water of MPN coliform had risk 5, 6 times compared to using standard water.
