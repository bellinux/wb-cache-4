5|$|From {{at least}} the 16th century, daffadown dilly and daffydowndilly have {{appeared}} as playful synonyms of the name. In common parlance and in historical documents, the term daffodil may refer specifically to populations or specimens of the <b>wild</b> <b>daffodil,</b> N. pseudonarcissus. H. N. Ellacombe suggests this may be from Saffon Lilly, citing Prior in support, though admittedly conjectural.|$|E
5|$|Between Kintbury Lock and Newbury, passing to {{the north}} of Hamstead Marshall, the canal is very close to the River Kennet, which flows into the canal via several channels. The canal passes through an area known as the Kennet Valley Alderwoods, the largest {{remaining}} fragments of damp, ash-alder woodland in the River Kennet floodplain. The SSSI includes two woods– the Wilderness and part of Ryott's Plantation– which are important because they support a very great diversity of plants associated with this woodland type, dominated by alder (Alnus glutinosa); though ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is abundant in places and there is occasional oak (Quercus robur) and wych elm (Ulmus glabra). In addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse bryophyte flora including the uncommon epiphytes Radula complanata, Zygodon viridissimus and Orthotrichum affine. Nearby is Irish Hill Copse. This site of coppiced ancient woodland includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice on the hill sides, merging into wet ash/maple and acid oak/ash/hazel woodland with aspen, on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), with abundant herb paris (Paris quadrifolia), toothwort (Lathraea squamaria), Solomon's seal (Polygonatum multiflorum), twayblade and early purple orchids (Listera ovata) and Orchis mascula and, locally, <b>wild</b> <b>daffodil</b> (Narcissus pseudonarcissus).|$|E
25|$|Keith, {{as well as}} {{suggesting}} a tie to the myth of Clytie, also points to that of Narcissus (to be found, amongst other ancient sources, in the Metamorphoses of Ovid, like the Clytie tale). The Narcissus story tells of love corrupted by inward-looking selfishness, rather than by jealousy. It may be {{no accident that the}} Youth in the poem has connections to flower-imagery (the Narcissus being the <b>Wild</b> <b>Daffodil).</b>|$|E
50|$|Ketford Bank {{supports}} {{an abundant}} population of <b>Wild</b> <b>Daffodils.</b> This area of Gloucestershire has traditionally supported this particular plant, which {{grows in the}} woods and pastures.
