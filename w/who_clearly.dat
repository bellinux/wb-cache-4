25|$|It is unclear, though, how John {{might have}} {{had access to the}} works of the Rhineland mystics.

In addition, if it is acknowledged that an influence on John was Francisco de Osuna (<b>who</b> <b>clearly</b> cannot have read the Rhineland mystics since they were not known in Spain in the 1520s), then another problem is raised.|$|E

25|$|Leaving aside any {{question}} as {{to the reality of}} supernatural events as such, the primary doubts about the historicity of Juan Diego (and the Guadalupe event itself) arise from the silence of those major sources who would be expected to have mentioned him, including, in particular, Bishop Juan de Zumárraga and the earliest ecclesiastical historians who reported the spread of the Catholic faith among the Indians in the early decades after the capture of Tenochtítlan in 1521. Despite references in near-contemporary sources which do attest a mid-16th-century Marian cult attached to a miraculous image of the Virgin at a shrine at Tepeyac under the title of Our Lady of Guadalupe, and despite the weight of oral tradition concerning Juan Diego and the apparitions (which, at the most, spans less than four generations before being reduced to writing), the fundamental objection of this silence of core 16th-century sources remains a perplexing feature {{of the history of the}} cult which has, nevertheless, continued to grow outside Mexico and the Americas. The first writer to address this problem of the silence of the sources was Francisco de Florencia in chapter 12 of his book Estrella de el norte de Mexico (see previous section). However, it was not until 1794 that the argument from silence was presented to the public in detail by someone – Juan Bautista Muñoz – <b>who</b> <b>clearly</b> did not believe in the historicity of Juan Diego or of the apparitions. Substantially the same argument was publicized in updated form at the end of the 19th and 20th centuries in reaction to renewed steps taken by the ecclesiastical authorities to defend and promote the cult through the coronation of the Virgin in 1895 and the beatification of Juan Diego in 1990.|$|E

500|$|Three more 2001 {{releases}} featured Zinta, including Abbas-Mustan's romantic drama Chori Chori Chupke Chupke, {{which was}} released after a one-year delay {{due to the}} trial of producer Bharat Shah. This film {{was one of the}} first Bollywood films to address the controversial issue of surrogate childbirth. Zinta played the role of Madhubala, a golden-hearted prostitute hired as a surrogate mother. Initially reluctant to play the part, she eventually accepted it at the directors' persuasion and, to prepare for it, visited several bars and nightclubs at Mumbai's red-light areas to study the lingo and mannerisms of sex-workers. She received a second Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Filmfare Awards for her performance, of which reviewer Sukanya Verma wrote, [...] "Preity Zinta, <b>who</b> <b>clearly</b> has the meatiest part of all, makes the best of it. Her transformation from the cocky and unabashed prostitute to a sensitive and warm person is amazingly believable." ...|$|E
500|$|Film critic Richard Roeper {{described}} Digging for Fire as [...] "a movie made {{by someone}} <b>who</b> <b>clearly</b> loves {{the art of}} movies" [...] and praised the casting and editing.

Variety Ben Kenigsberg characterized the film as [...] "a lovely slice of everything and nothing" [...] and gave particular praise to the cinematography, editing and improvisation. Peter Travers, who awarded the film 3 out of 4 stars in a review for Rolling Stone, highlighted the performances, cinematography and score, and felt that Digging for Fire showed Swanberg to be [...] "a true filmmaker". Screen International critic Tim Grierson found the film {{to be honest and}} insightful, and drew particular attention to Johnson and DeWitt's [...] "nimble, low-key performances". An Banh of Indiewire opined that the film was the most [...] "emotionally mature" [...] of Swanberg's works and that each of the actors gave [...] "purposeful, plot-driven performances" [...] in spite of the large cast.|$|E

500|$|The death scenes {{attracted}} over 250 complaints, 154 {{of them to}} {{the television}} watchdog, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, the highest number of complaints for a television programme in 2002. In the wake of the complaints, BBC insiders had admitted that the scenes [...] "clearly disturbed" [...] some of the viewers, but also defended their decision to show the scene as it would show the audience [...] "the kind of threat which might be faced by agents engaged in the fight against terrorism." [...] The Broadcasting Standards Commission stated that despite the shocking content; [...] "in the context was acceptable and important for the later narrative," [...] however the watchdog still criticised the BBC for failing to warn viewers of the violence to come. Garrett refuted this, stating: [...] "Not only was there a clear warning before the programme began, but for anyone who missed that, {{the subject matter of the}} episode (a conspiracy to stir up inter-racial violence perpetrated by a man <b>who</b> <b>clearly</b> beat his wife) was hardly the stuff of which chirpy little bucolic fantasies are made." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{varieties}} of inequality violate {{the doctrine of}} reasonable classification: over-inclusiveness and under-inclusiveness. If a classification is over-inclusive, the net cast by the legislature catches a class of persons not contemplated as falling within {{the objectives of the}} Act. Conversely, an under-inclusive classification arises if the net cast does not catch a class of persons <b>who</b> <b>clearly</b> do fall within the mischief sought to be addressed. Tussman and tenBroek represent the two inequalities in a Venn diagram, an adaptation of which is reproduced on the right. Between the two inequalities, over-inclusiveness is a more egregious violation of the equal protection provision in the Constitution, for it affects the [...] "innocent bystander, the hapless victim of circumstance or association". In comparison, under-inclusiveness should not be fatal. The Court of Appeal in Taw Cheng Kong held that, keeping in mind practical considerations, [...] "the enactment of a provision need not be seamless and perfect to cover every contingency". The legislature is reasonably entitled to address the mischief [...] "in a piecemeal fashion", as the equal protection clause is not [...] "a pedagogic requirement of the impracticable".|$|E
500|$|Referring to the {{parliamentary}} material {{relating to the}} original Act and the subsequent addition of section 37(1), the Court found that section 37(1) was added to [...] "address acts of corruption taking place outside Singapore but affecting events within it". To this end, it held that classification {{along the lines of}} citizenship was an unreasonable means of attaining the objective of section 37(1) of PCA, for it was both over-inclusive and under-inclusive. Legislation is over-inclusive if it catches a class of persons not originally contemplated as falling within the objective of the Act, and under-inclusive if it catches a class of persons <b>who</b> <b>clearly</b> do not fall within the mischief sought to be addressed by the Act. On the facts, section 37(1) was over-inclusive as a Singapore citizen who was now a permanent resident of a foreign country and employed there who received a bribe in a foreign currency from a foreign payor would be guilty of an offence under the Act. Conversely, it was simultaneously under-inclusive since a Singapore permanent resident or a foreigner working for the Government of Singapore who takes a trip outside Singapore to receive a bribe in Singapore dollars in relation to an act he will do in Singapore is not caught under the Act.|$|E

500|$|On October 19, 2010, Scribner {{published}} {{a collection of}} short stories, Palo Alto, by Franco. The book is named after the California city where Franco grew up and is dedicated to many of the writers he worked with at Brooklyn College. Inspired by some of Franco's own teenage memories Palo Alto, and memories written and submitted by high school students at Palo Alto Senior High School, consists of life in Palo Alto as experienced by a series of teenagers who {{spend most of their time}} indulging in driving drunk, smoking weed and taking part in unplanned acts of violence. Each passage is told by a young narrator. The book has received mixed reviews; Los Angeles Times called it [...] "the work of an ambitious young man <b>who</b> <b>clearly</b> loves to read, who has a good eye for detail, but who has spent way too much time on style and virtually none on substance". The Guardian said that Franco's [...] "foray into the literary world may be met with cynicism in some quarters, but this is a promising debut from a most unlikely source". Writing in The New York Times, reviewer and fellow author Joshua Mohr praised Franco for how, in the story [...] "American History", he juxtaposed historical parts with a present-day social commentary that [...] "makes the we wonder how much we've actually evolved in post-bellum America". At least one editor of a literary journal testified he would not publish Franco's stories, claiming he has been published due to his star power, not literary talent. Publishers Weekly reviewed the collection, stating [...] "The author fails to find anything remotely insightful to say in these 11 amazingly underwhelming stories".|$|E
