25|$|A DBN {{can be used}} to generatively pre-train a DNN {{by using}} the learned DBN weights as the initial DNN weights.

This is particularly helpful when training data are limited, because poorly initialized weights can significantly hinder model performance.

2500|$|The U.S. Navy {{released}} the long-delayed RFP for the UCLASS on 17 April 2014, after Navy Secretary Ray Mabus signed the draft the previous day. The draft RFP was {{planned to be}} released in mid-2013, but was repeatedly delayed by disagreements over the proposed aircraft's stealth levels, ability to survive in contested airspace, and in-flight refueling ability. [...] Though classified, available details showed original UCLASS specifications of continuously providing two ISR orbits at range over uncontested airspace with a light strike capability to eliminate targets of opportunity. [...] The airframe would also have an open architecture design to be easily upgradable. The Navy was pursuing a path to at first use the UCLASS as a reconnaissance asset with proven standoff sensor technologies to observe targets in uncontested international airspace, while building in excess <b>weight,</b> <b>space,</b> and power capacity to add sensors and weapons and modify it later for use in contested airspace if needed. In July 2014, JROC launched a review of the UCLASS program in response to congressional criticism that Navy requirements were too narrowly focused to meet future mission threats. [...] Although the Navy planned to weaponize the UCLASS incrementally, stealth and payload are things that must be built into an airframe and cannot be engineered in at a later time. With the requirements again being reviewed, the planned release of the RFP in late July was suspended until {{the creation of a new}} joint Capabilities Development Document (CDD).|$|E

5000|$|Many {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} the main cause of catastrophic interference is overlap in the representations at the hidden layer of distributed neural networks. In a distributed representation any given input will tend to create changes in the weights to many of the nodes. Catastrophic forgetting occurs because when many of the weights, where 'knowledge is stored, are changed it is impossible for prior knowledge to be kept intact. During sequential learning, the inputs become mixed with the new input being superimposed over top of the old input. Another way to conceptualize this is through visualizing learning as movement through a <b>weight</b> <b>space.</b> This <b>weight</b> <b>space</b> can be likened to a spatial representation of all of the possible combinations of weights that the network can possess. When a network first learns to represent a set of patterns, it has found a point in <b>weight</b> <b>space</b> which allows it to recognize all of the patterns that it has seen. However, when the network learns a new set of patterns sequentially it will move to a place in the <b>weight</b> <b>space</b> that allows it to only recognize the new pattern. To recognize both sets of patterns, the network must find a place in <b>weight</b> <b>space</b> that can represent both the new and the old output. One {{way to do this is}} by connecting a hidden unit to only a subset of the input units. This reduces the likelihood that two different inputs will be encoded by the same hidden units and weights, and so will decrease the chance of interference. [...] Indeed, a number of the proposed solutions to catastrophic interference involve reducing the amount of overlap that occurs when storing information in these weights.|$|E
