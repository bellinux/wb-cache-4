5|$|In mid-1943 the District Engineer of the Manhattan Engineer District, Lt-Col Kenneth Nichols {{had several}} queries from Canada {{relating}} to contracts Canadian firms Eldorado Gold Mines and Consolidated Mining and Smelting (CMS of Cominco) {{had for the}} secret atomic bomb project; CMS was building a heavy water plant and Eldorado was mining and processing uranium ore. He phoned a C. D. Howe in Ottawa and arranged to travel on the overnight train to Ottawa and see Howe the next day (June 14). On arriving at the address given Nichols <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> Howe was the minister of munitions and supply, and found him most friendly. Howe was told about the Manhattan Project, and Nichols was told that Eldorado was now a Crown company.|$|E
25|$|G.M.B. Dobson (Exploring the Atmosphere, 2nd Edition, Oxford, 1968) {{mentioned}} that when springtime ozone {{levels in the}} Antarctic over Halley Bay were first measured in 1956, he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> they were ~320 DU, or about 150 DU below spring Arctic levels of ~450 DU. These were {{at that time the}} only known Antarctic ozone values available. What Dobson describes is essentially the baseline from which the ozone hole is measured: actual ozone hole values are in the 150–100 DU range.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, Berkley Books {{published}} The Illustrated Dune, an {{edition of}} Dune with 33 black-and-white sketch drawings and 8 full color paintings by John Schoenherr, {{who had done}} the cover art for the first printing of Dune and had illustrated the Analog serializations of Dune and Children of Dune. Herbert wrote in 1980 that though he had not spoken to Schoenherr prior to the artist creating the paintings, the author <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the artwork appeared exactly as he had imagined its fictional subjects, including sandworms, Baron Harkonnen and the Sardaukar.|$|E

25|$|November 24 was dark, {{with low}} clouds, fog, and drizzling rain. Sherman's force crossed the Tennessee River {{successfully}} in the morning then took the set of hills {{at the north end}} of Missionary Ridge, although he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> a valley separated him from the main part of the ridge. Alerted by Grigsby's cavalry that the enemy had crossed the river in force, Bragg sent Cleburne's division and Wright's brigade to challenge Sherman. After skirmishing with the Confederates, Sherman ordered his men to dig in on the hills he had seized. Cleburne, likewise, dug in around Tunnel Hill.|$|E
25|$|At {{first there}} was some {{question}} as to what exactly the new company should do. It did not seem {{that there would be}} any way for them to afford to develop a new computer, given that the now-large CDC had been unable to support more than one. When the President in charge of financing traveled to Wall Street to look for seed capital, he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> Cray's reputation was very well known. Far from struggling for some role to play in the market, the financial world was more than willing to provide Cray with all the money they would need to develop a new machine.|$|E
25|$|Lee <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the Federal {{army was}} moving {{as quickly as}} it was. As they crossed the Potomac and entered Frederick, Maryland, the Confederates were spread out over a {{considerable}} distance in Pennsylvania, with Richard Ewell across the Susquehanna River from Harrisburg and James Longstreet and A. P. Hill behind the mountains in Chambersburg. His cavalry, under Jeb Stuart, was engaged in a wide-ranging raid around the eastern flank of the Union army and was uncharacteristically out of touch with headquarters, leaving Lee blind as to his enemy's position and intentions. Lee realized that, just as in the Maryland Campaign, he had to concentrate his army before it could be defeated in detail. He ordered all units to move to the general vicinity of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.|$|E

25|$|Through their friendship, Burke {{discovered}} that Crabbe was {{more suited to}} be a clergyman than a surgeon. Crabbe had a good knowledge of Latin and an evident natural piety, and was well read in the scriptures. He was ordained to the curacy of his native town on 21 December 1781 through Burke's recommendation. He returned to live in Aldeburgh with his sister and father, his mother having died in his absence. Crabbe <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> he was poorly treated by his fellow townsmen, who resented his rise in social class. With Burke's help, Crabbe was able to leave Aldeburgh to become chaplain to the Duke of Rutland at Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire. This was an unusual move on Burke's part, as this kind of preferment would usually {{have been given to}} a family member or personal friend of the Duke or through political interest.|$|E
25|$|Pichegru ordered Saint-Cyr, a mere {{lieutenant}} colonel, to take {{command of}} Pierre's brigade on 6 December. After his brigade was reinforced, Saint-Cyr moved on Berstheim on the 8th. The Royalists taunted the Republicans, asking {{if they were}} bringing them more artillery to capture. Saint-Cyr advanced his light troops {{to the edge of}} the village before pulling back. The émigré infantry under General Gelb and cavalry led by Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien rushed in pursuit. On this day the Royalists were mauled and Gelb was killed while Enghien's coat was riddled with bullet holes. The Duke of Bourbon narrowly escaped death. When he cut his way into the 19th Line Infantry, a Republican officer recognized him and saluted with his sword rather than running him through. On 9 December, Saint-Cyr advanced on Berstheim again and <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the Royalists had retired. This move was part of Wurmser's deliberate withdrawal to the Moder.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Morawiec {{believed}} that the game would face [...] "acceptance challenges" [...] from both fans and the gaming media as Sonic the Hedgehog Pinball strayed away from the traditional platforming genre. After returning home to the United States from Europe, Morawiec <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the game had sold well, and was pleased that it benefited from the franchise's popularity. Nonetheless, he regretted that the team had lacked time to [...] "polish" [...] the game properly.|$|E

500|$|As soon as {{the design}} was complete, in April 1960, Pierre Satre, the company's {{technical}} director, was sent to Bristol to discuss a partnership. Bristol <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the Sud team had designed a very similar aircraft after considering the SST problem and coming to the very same conclusions as the Bristol and STAC teams in terms of economics. It was later revealed that the original STAC report, marked [...] "For UK Eyes Only", had secretly been passed to the French to win political favour. Sud made {{minor changes to the}} paper, and presented it as their own work.|$|E
500|$|After {{receiving}} a respectable {{amount of attention}} in the United States, the series was licensed to Pioneer Entertainment (later Geneon Entertainment) in June 2003, only {{two months after the}} first episode aired in Japan. When Geneon's compilation DVDs were released, reviewers such as IGN praised them despite the use of Dolby Digital 2.0 audio mix over a 5.1 mix. [...] "The separation is masterfully taken care of with voices, music, and sound effects leveled off very cleanly for both the Japanese and English audio tracks." [...] In an interview with director Koichi Chigira given in July 2004, he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the series had reached a great level of popularity among fans in the United States.|$|E
500|$|The first book-length {{scholarly}} {{work was}} Rabbi Bertram Korn's The American Reaction to the Mortara Case: 1858–1859 (1957), which was devoted entirely to {{public opinion in}} the United States and, according to Kertzer, often incorrect about details of the case. The main historical reference until the 1990s {{was a series of}} articles written by the Italian scholar Gemma Volli and published around the centenary of the controversy in 1958–60. When David Kertzer began studying the case he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> many of his Italian colleagues were not familiar with it, while specialists in Jewish studies across the world invariably were—Mortara had, as Kertzer put it, [...] " [...] from the mainstream of Italian history into the ghetto of Jewish history". Kertzer explored many sources not previously studied and eventually published The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara (1997), which has become the standard reference work for the affair.|$|E

500|$|Richard Edgeworth {{observed}} on his wife's death that being {{familiar with the}} experimental method in science, she <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> educational theory was based on very little empirical evidence, {{and set out to}} apply experimental science to child education and devised, executed and recorded experiments with children. She conceived and executed a register (2 volumes 1778–1779) of the reaction of children to new knowledge and experience, given her interest in applying experimental science to the field of child education. She observed the questions that children asked, what they did, and how they solved problems. An extensive example of her recorded dialogue is given by Richard and Maria Edgeworth in [...] "Practical Education". This formed the basis of Richard Edgeworth's Essays on professional education (1809). In the Bodleian Library there is a short story in manuscript dated 1787 and other fragments attributed to Honora Sneyd. Her parents' principles of childhood education were to be a profound influence on Maria Edgeworth's own career as a writer for children.|$|E
500|$|RZA sent several beats to West, {{including}} some that he cited as being edgy, {{because he felt}} that West was the type who could work well on more forceful production, including the brooding [...] "So Appalled". The song was nearly featured on Last Train to Paris, a studio album by Diddy. According to another producer on the song, No I.D., it was offered to both Jay-Z and Diddy before it leaked. West freestyled over the track for fun and found that he actually liked it enough to ultimately use it himself, stating {{that it would make}} a good group song. Cyhi the Prynce's verse only appeared on the song because he [...] "tricked" [...] West. Originally he was only supposed to deliver a quick hook, but at the time West was tired and let Cyhi record his verse alone. [...] When West awoke and played back the tape, he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> Cyhi had recorded an entire verse. Impressed with it, West decided to include it on the track anyway. The song reportedly offended M.C. Hammer, who Jay-Z references on the line [...] "I spent another 30 / Cause unlike Hammer 30 million can't hurt me".|$|E
500|$|Game four {{was played}} in Vancouver. Team Canada <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the crowd booed Canada during the warm-up and cheered louder for the Soviets during the game's introduction. The game started with two {{consecutive}} penalties by Bill Goldsworthy and Boris Mikhailov scored power play goals on both penalties {{to give the}} Soviets a 2–0 lead. Goldsworthy, who had started in place of Wayne Cashman, wanted to replace Cashman's truculence, but only hurt his team and was criticized privately by Sinden. In the second, Gilbert Perreault scored on a Soviet own-goal to get Canada within one goal, but Blinov scored {{less than a minute}} later to restore the two-goal lead. Rod Gilbert scored a questionable goal that was disallowed and Canada's protests went unheeded. To Sinden, that was the turning point of the game, and the result could have been different had the goal been allowed, although Sinden admitted that it was [...] "a beating." [...] Vikulov scored to put the Soviets ahead 4–1 after two periods. In the third, Goldsworthy made partial amends to get Canada to 4–2, but Shadrin scored to put the game out of reach. Dennis Hull scored in the final minute to make it closer, but it was too late.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{criticized the}} lack of Master Chief as a main character, similar to the {{response}} to The Halo Graphic Novel; Schedeen said that [...] "Master Chief is barely a guest star in his own book", {{and that he was}} reduced to blasting aliens for much of the series. Schedeen felt that {{there was a lack of}} connections between the Ruwan plot and the Master Chief's adventures, which was never satisfactorily resolved. The comic's focus on Ruwan and Myra's subplot was also seen as a major fault: Comics Bulletin's Geoff Collins, in a review of the second issue, said that [...] "as a comic book fan I’m interested , but the Halo fans I know could [...] care less about them. And the story in this issue centers around them." [...] Schedeen <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> he only began to care about them in the final issue. The many delays in publishing were a frequent point of frustration as well. Schedeen summed up his reviews by saying that he was hopeful the production teams behind the upcoming Halo books [...] "will learn from the mistakes made here and craft stories that can consistently capture what makes Halo fun. At the very least, let's hope we don't have to wait a year between issues anymore".|$|E
500|$|Caracciola's {{breakthrough}} {{year was}} in 1926. The inaugural German Grand Prix {{was held at}} the AVUS track on 11 July, but the date clashed with a more prestigious race in Spain. The newly merged company Mercedes-Benz, conscious of export considerations, chose the latter race to run their main team. Hearing this, Caracciola took a short leave from his job and went to the Mercedes office in Stuttgart to ask for a car. Mercedes agreed to lend Caracciola and Adolf Rosenberger two 1923 2-litre M218s, provided they enter not as works drivers but independents. Rosenberger started well in front of the 230,000spectators, but Caracciola stalled his engine. His riding mechanic, Eugen Salzer, jumped out and pushed the car to get it started, but by the time they began moving they had lost more than a minute to the leaders. It started to rain, and Caracciola passed many cars that had retired in the poor conditions. Rosenberger lost control at the North Curve on the eighth lap when trying to pass a slower car, and crashed into the timekeepers' box, killing all three occupants; Caracciola kept driving. In the fog and rain, he had no idea which position he was in, but resolved to keep driving so he could at least finish the race. When he finished the 20th and final lap, he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> he had won the race. The German press dubbed him Regenmeister, or [...] "Rainmaster", for his prowess in the wet conditions.|$|E
500|$|Spain {{signed the}} Second Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1796, allying itself with France against Great Britain and {{beginning}} the Anglo-Spanish War. On 11 July 1797 Daoíz {{was placed in}} charge of a gunboat in the Defence of Cadiz, commanded by Admiral Jose de Mazarredo y Salazar, against the British blockading squadron. During the defence his gunboat, No. 5, was involved in an attack on the British third-rate HMS Powerful. Later that year he was seconded to the Spanish Navy, which was short of trained officers, for service aboard the 74 gun ship San Ildefonso. Daoíz sailed twice with the vessel to the Americas, escorting galleons. During this time he assisted the ship's captain, Jose de Iriarte, by acting as a translator during negotiations with foreign officials and found time to write a short treatise on the instruction of soldiers and sailors. [...] Whilst with the ship in Havana, Cuba, in November 1800 Daoíz was reading back issues of a gazette and <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> he had been promoted to captain on 4 March 1800, whilst at sea. He did not enjoy the long trips away from Spain and requested a land based posting, serving initially as a lieutenant in the infantry before joining the newly formed 3rd Artillery Regiment of Seville on 7 July 1802. Had he stayed aboard the San Ildefonso Daoíz may have seen action with the ship at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.|$|E
