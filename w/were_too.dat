5|$|Like modern crocodilians, pterosaurs {{appeared}} {{to have had a}} hepatic piston, seeing as their shoulder-pectoral girdles <b>were</b> <b>too</b> inflexible to move the sternum as in birds, and they possessed strong gastralia. Thus, their respiratory system had characteristics comparable to both modern archosaur clades.|$|E
5|$|Muslim forces {{apparently}} <b>were</b> <b>too</b> {{small in}} numbers {{to counter the}} Byzantine threat, and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, the chief Muslim commander of the Syrian front, requested reinforcements from Abu Bakr. The latter responded by sending reinforcements led by Khalid.|$|E
5|$|The Seven Dwarfs made rare {{appearances}} in shorts, despite their popularity; they simply <b>were</b> <b>too</b> numerous to animate efficiently. Commissioned shorts The Standard Parade (1939), The Seven Wise Dwarfs (1941, using mostly recycled footage), All Together (1942) and The Winged Scourge (1943) all include appearances.|$|E

5|$|A 2007 study {{suggested}} that Massospondylus {{may have used}} its short arms for defense against predators ("defensive swats"), in intraspecies combat, or in feeding, although its arms <b>were</b> <b>too</b> short to reach its mouth. Scientists speculate that Massospondylus could have used its large pollex (thumb) claw in combat, to strip plant material from trees, digging, or for grooming.|$|E
5|$|A catchy jingle and ad campaign, it {{has come}} to embody a piece of Americana, and has even seeped into the {{consciousness}} of people who <b>were</b> <b>too</b> young (or not even alive) to remember the campaign when it occurred.

50|$|If s <b>is</b> <b>too</b> large, {{then the}} new {{solution}} generated will <b>be</b> <b>too</b> {{far away from}} the old solution (or even jump outside of the bounds). Then, such a move is unlikely to be accepted. If s <b>is</b> <b>too</b> small, the change <b>is</b> <b>too</b> small to <b>be</b> significant, and consequently such search is not efficient. So a proper step size is important to maintain the search as efficient as possible.|$|R

Lowestoffe sent her boat and first lieutenant {{to take over the}} prize, but the seas <b>were</b> <b>too</b> rough to allow the American to be boarded, so the lieutenant returned. Nelson stepped forward and volunteered to make an attempt; he succeeded.|$|E
5|$|After Cerezeda took {{most of the}} {{inhabitants}} of Trujillo into Higueras, the city entered a period of serious decline. Those inhabitants that remained <b>were</b> <b>too</b> old, too sick, or too dispirited to head west. Basic supplies such as food and clothing were scarce. The citizens believed that Cerezeda wished to abandon Trujillo, and appealed to the audiencia of Santo Domingo, and to the Crown, for supplies and a Crown-appointed governor.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} December elections, the Fraser {{government}} took {{the approach that}} trade with Southeast Asia and political ties with Southeast Asia <b>were</b> <b>too</b> important to be put at risk for what {{was seen as a}} lost cause. Australia abstained from the 1976 and 1977 UN General Assembly Resolutions, and by 1978 became the only government to officially recognise East Timor as a province of Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|All major {{forecasting}} agencies predicted an above-average season. All {{reduced their}} seasonal predictions in early August, {{but even the}} revised predictions <b>were</b> <b>too</b> high. The lack of activity was primarily caused by an unexpected significant weakening of the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation between winter and spring. This resulted in continuation of the spring weather pattern over the Atlantic Ocean, with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level moisture, and atmospheric stability, which suppressed tropical cyclogenesis.|$|E
5|$|All species {{experienced}} over-hunting by sealers. The Hawaiian {{monk seal}} experienced population drops in the 19th century and during World War II, and the Caribbean monk seal was exploited since the 1500s until the 1850s, when populations <b>were</b> <b>too</b> low to hunt commercially. The Mediterranean monk seal has experienced commercial hunting since the Middle Ages and eradication by fishermen. Monk seals {{have developed a}} fear of humans, and may even abandon beaches due to human presence. There are currently around 1,700 monk seals in total.|$|E
5|$|All these {{attempts}} {{to mount a}} combined offensive between the Franks and Mongols <b>were</b> <b>too</b> little and too late. In May 1291, the city of Acre was conquered by the Egyptian Mamluks in the Siege of Acre. When Pope Nicholas IV learned of this, he wrote to Arghun, again asking him to be baptized and {{to fight against the}} Mamluks. But Arghun had died on , and Pope Nicholas died as well in March 1292, putting an end to their efforts towards combined action.|$|E

30|$|The {{division}} of sub-regions {{has a great}} impact on the tracking effect. Each sub-region may be overlapped or non-overlapping; sub-region size can be fixed or adaptive. If the sub-region <b>is</b> <b>too</b> large, it will <b>be</b> <b>too</b> sensitive to occlusion, while if the sub-region <b>is</b> <b>too</b> small, it may lose target information and there will <b>be</b> <b>too</b> many sub-regions; thus, the computational cost of the algorithm will be very high. In this paper, the target is divided into four sub-regions.|$|R
