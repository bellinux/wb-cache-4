[...] The song has been described to be a mix of Usher and Justin Timberlake, and {{has been compared to}} Chris Brown's [...] "With You." ...|$|E

Throughout the single, Fantasia reveals her personal [...] "journey to happiness" [...] by singing, [...] "When I met you, I met me too." [...] She also shares memories of her past heartbreaks using lyrics such as: “Listen to me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you/Without him {{there would be no}} you/So yes, I thank my ex a little still."

They spent their pre-season playing in Scotland and England where they won all seven matches. Carl Hoeft said of the pre-season; [...] "Looking back now, it's safe to say it wasn't probably the best way we could have prepared. Even now, people think were crazy <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> them what we did". They were now coached by Glenn Ross and captained by Taine Randell. Their eight defeats that season included a 7543 defeat by Natal in Durban. The points scored by Natal included 50 points by Gavin Lawlessa competition record.

500|$|The {{changes were}} met with controversy, with critics arguing that the new chart failed {{to take into account}} R and rap music's {{traditionally}} African-American demographic. Psy's climb to number one in particular was also criticized, with Ebro Darden, program director of New York City radio station WQHT, arguing: [...] "Trust me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you hip-hop does not consider Psy rap. Billboard has pull, but they cannot make people who live hip-hop believe Psy is rap." [...] In response, Billboard chart director Bill Werde defended the changes as a necessary means of reflecting consumer tastes on genre charts. In a 25th anniversary listing of the top 100 songs in the history of Hot Rap Songs based on chart performance, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis' 2013 15-week number-one single [...] "Thrift Shop" [...] was ranked at number one, {{thanks in part to the}} new methodology.|$|E

Laurin explained: [...] "Even before the Belmont, you remember, I said I really didn't know how I could give this horse a rest. He's so strong and full of energy. Well, {{this is only a}} week and a half after the Belmont, and believe me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you, if I don't run this horse he's going to hurt himself in his stall. So we decided it would be nice to race him in Chicago to let the people in the Midwest have a chance to see him run." [...] The race was run at [...] miles with a purse of $125,000. The challengers were grouped as a single betting entry at 6–1: Secretariat was 1–20 (the legal minimum) and created a minus pool of $17,941.|$|E
500|$|... "Criminal" [...] {{was written}} in 2008 by Max Martin, Shellback and Tiffany Amber, and was {{produced}} by Martin and Shellback. Spears told MTV News that after she first listened to the song, she felt it was different and unlike anything she had heard before. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Spears spoke about Martin's productions on Femme Fatale, saying, [...] "Max played a huge role on this album {{and he has been}} there since the beginning so there is such a huge level of trust. He gets exactly what I am saying <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> him what I want and don’t want musically". Spears recorded her vocals at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The track was later mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. It was registered on Broadcast Music Incorporated under the legal title [...] "In Love With a Criminal". On March 2, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account a link to a 17-second clip of the song, describing it as [...] "one of [...] favorites".|$|E

500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E

2500|$|What {{will be your}} Lordships astonishment <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> {{you that}} an act passed {{for the express purpose}} of gratifying the Canadians & which was {{supposed}} to comprehend all that they either wished or wanted is become the first object of their discontent & dislike. English officers to command them in time of war, & English Laws to govern them in time of Peace, is the general wish. the former they know to be impossible (at least at present) & by the latter if I understand them right, they mean no Laws & no Government whatsoever – in the mean time it may be truly said that Gen. Carleton had taken an ill measure of the influence of the seigneurs & Clergy over the lower order of people whose Principle of conduct founded in fear & the sharpness of authority over them now no longer exercised, is unrestrained, & breaks out in every shape of contempt or detestation of those whom they used to behold with terror & who gave them I believe too many occasions to express it. And they on their parts have been and are too much elated with the advantages they supposed they should derive from the restoration of their old Privileges & customs, & indulged themselves in a way of thinking & talking that gave very just offence, as well to their own People as to the English merchants.|$|E
2500|$|Spears {{talked about}} her {{feelings}} toward the conservatorship her father contains and how she feels about her life, and quotes [...] "There's no excitement, there's no passion... I have really good days, and then I have bad days. Even {{when you go to}} jail, you know there's the time when you're gonna get out. But in this situation, it's never ending. It's just like Groundhog Day every day." [...] Spears added [...] "I think it's too in control, If I wasn't under the restraints I'm under, I'd feel so liberated. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> them the way I feel, it's like they hear but they're really not listening. I never wanted to become one of those prisoner people. I always wanted to feel free." [...] The singer also commented on her feelings towards fans and her music style. [...] "It's weird because your music is a reflection of what you're going through," [...] she says. [...] "It's such a part of me, the record, 'cause of what I've gone through." [...] In another clip, Spears talks about how she uses her work as a dancer and singer to deal with the stress of her life and how it helps her deal with her emotions. She said that for her, dancing is like therapy. [...] "If I have a lot of nervous energy, when I start dancing, it all goes away and I just feel emotion. It's like a rollercoaster," [...] she says. [...] "People think that when you go through something in life {{you have to go to}} therapy. For me, art is therapy, because it's like you're expressing yourself in such a spiritual way. [...] "Sometimes you don't need to use words to go through what you need to go through," [...] she continues. [...] "Sometimes it's an emotion you need to feel when you dance, that you need to touch. And the only thing that can touch it is when you move a certain way." ...|$|E
