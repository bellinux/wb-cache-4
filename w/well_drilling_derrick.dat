50|$|The two <b>Drilling</b> <b>Derricks</b> of the {{historical}} salt works built in 1865 and 1882 and the brine reservoir built in 1882 are technical monuments since 1984.|$|R
50|$|The {{discovery}} {{well was}} placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 9, 1977. The present site preserves the concrete <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick</b> foundations and the capped well head.|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} the first to offer a dual <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick</b> capability. The dual {{derricks}} allowed simultaneous operations to be performed, and according to Transocean increased efficiency by 40 percent.|$|R

25|$|BP {{reported}} that the <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick</b> (tower) on its Mad Dog platform had been toppled into the sea, adding {{that it was too}} early to predict when the platform could resume production.|$|R
50|$|It was {{reported}} on September 16, 2008 that Mad Dog was damaged due to Hurricane Ike. The <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick</b> was toppled over {{and was on}} the sea bed. A new drilling package was built and replaced the damaged one on the spar in early 2012.|$|R
50|$|Drilling was {{performed}} using a conventional core wireline {{system with a}} <b>drill</b> <b>derrick,</b> protected by a cover against the rough climate. Sea ice was 2 m thick with a water depth of 150 - 300 m below. Four overlapping drill cores at three sites reflect in excellent quality the geological history and glaciation of the Antarctic during the last 34 million years.|$|R
5000|$|The Upper <b>Drilling</b> <b>Derrick</b> {{is located}} in a half timbered {{building}} and was restored by a local initiative from 2006 until 2009 and is a Museum since. The Lower <b>Drilling</b> <b>Derrick,</b> directly adjacent to the Brine Reservoir, is still operating and is pumping brine. A small timbered structure was erected over the first brinewell in 1668 which survived until the 1960 and was taken away than to make room for a wider road intersection at Solstraße and Severshuser Weg. It was called [...] "Solhaus" [...] and reconstructed a few meters from the original site in 1992.The old administrative building, Faktoreihaus, of the than state owned salt works was constructed in 1694. It is located on Solstraße and survives in only slightly altered form. On the right hand side of the building is the chapel used for church services until today (2014). The protruding part of the office building was made so that the officers had {{a good view of the}} works area. The building got it´s present form after a rebuild in 1910. There are a few other buildings around Salinenplatz which have been erected in conjunction with the salt works.|$|R
2500|$|With {{critical}} support structures burned away, {{and with}} nothing to support the heavier structures on top, the platform began to collapse. One of the cranes collapsed, followed by the <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick.</b> The generation and utilities Module (D), which included the fireproofed accommodation block, slipped into the sea, taking the crewmen huddled inside with it. The largest part of the platform followed it. [...] "Rescue 138" [...] lands on Tharos [...] {{and picks up the}} 12 non-essential personnel, before leaving for Ocean Victory.|$|R
2500|$|World Saga {{was taken}} to Hitachi Zosen {{shipyard}} in Sakai, Japan, where all but the forward two-thirds of the tanker's hull were scrapped. The remaining section was reinforced with 7,000 tonnes of additional steel and strengthened against ice with 13,000 tonnes of concrete that formed a [...] thick inner hull. A new 4,000-ton topside with <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick,</b> cranes, helipad and accommodation block was installed {{on top of the}} ice-strengthened hull. The drilling unit was given the name SSDC, short for single steel drilling caisson.|$|R

40|$|Safety hazards {{during the}} {{drilling}} of land based {{oil and gas}} wells are reviewed. The general structure of {{the oil and gas}} field industry (SIC- 1381) is described. <b>Well</b> <b>drilling</b> technology and processes are outlined. Special hazards that can cause catastrophic accidents are examined. These consist of blow-outs and escape of hydrogen-sulfide (7783064). Drilling activities and the worker population at risk are discussed. Statistical data concerning oil and gas <b>well</b> <b>drilling</b> activities are presented. Hazard assessments of the oil and gas <b>well</b> <b>drilling</b> industries are discussed. Injury incidence rates and fatality statistics are summarized. Hazardous tasks performed in <b>well</b> <b>drilling</b> operations are noted. Handling of drill pipes, collars, and casings {{have been found to be}} responsible for more injuries than any other job activity. Task specific accidents are examined. General safety recommendations for oil and gas <b>well</b> <b>drilling</b> are considered. Safety guidelines for <b>well</b> <b>drilling</b> machinery and equipment are presented and safe work practices are described.
