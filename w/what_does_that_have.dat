40|$|Australia’s refugee {{policies}} are expensive {{in the short}} term and damage our economic prospects in the long term, says Stephen Bartos THE debate about refugees who try to come to Australia by boat is usually couched in terms of big concepts like morals, ethics, rights and sovereignty. For a few minutes let us instead take a cold, hard economic look at the issue. We know that one of the biggest economic problems we face in future is aging of the population. The government’s own Intergenerational Report warns of the dangers of the present generation of taxpayers imposing a heavy cost burden on the next. It argues that policies need to be “adjusted” by $ 87 billion by 2041. That is based though on overseas migration staying constant at around current levels. In its appendix an increased migration scenario results in “a decline in the aged to working-age ratio over the next four decades and a 10 per cent increase in GDP by 2041 - 42 ”. Taking out the jargon, increased migration to Australia will help ease the economic costs of aging. But by 2040 we will be in competition with many other countries for people to come here. Australia is still a relatively young country, and others face the aging problem sooner than us. They too will seek to encourage more migration. Around the world we see governments with aging populations already starting to think this way. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> to do with refugees? Well, one obvious factor that influences a country’s competitiveness in attracting migrants is whether that country is perceived as wanting them. What signals do our current approach to interception and mandatory detention send? Precisely the opposite. “We will decide who comes to this country and in what circumstances” made for an effective political slogan at the last election, but how does it sound from the perspective of people from other countries? Put it in personal terms - would {{you want to go to}} stay at a hotel or holiday resort which had that as its marketing slogan? Sure, right at the moment there are enough people who want to come to Australia that we don’t need to worry too much about how attractive we make the place sound. That won’t be so in 2040. But by then it will be too late to try to repair the damage to our reputation - and we will lose out in the competition for migrants. Policies that exploit the fears and insecurities of current Australians thus are diminishing the hopes and prospects of our children. A second economic issue is our labour market, and the people qualities needed to make our economy prosper. Companies aiming to succeed in a fast moving world no longer look for employees with narrowly based skills or training - much more important is their capacity to develop new skills. An ideal employee, or for that matter the new small business owner, is resilient, innovative, has initiative, resourcefulness and a positive attitude. That sounds a lot to me like a person prepared to leave their home country to escape oppression and make their way across the world in search of something better. This is not just theory. Thousands of Vietnamese boat people who arrived in Australia under the Fraser government have been highly successful in all walks of life. Our economy and society has been the winner. Finally, there is a simple economic fact that mandatory detention is a huge impost on the budget. Detention camps are more expensive than if we were to put boat people up in a five star hotel - and that’s just the costs in Australia. The so-called Pacific solution is much more expensive. This is some of the economic story. For the record, I happen to think the refugee issue is a moral one. Refugees deserve respect and compassion regardless of how they come here, and current government policy is inhumane and diminishes our standing as a decent society. However, I don’t need to make these points to listeners who agree with me on moral grounds, and likewise I doubt I will ever convince those who disagree on moral grounds. What I hope is that readers who do not hold strong views either way on the ethical issues will at least consider the economic arguments. Current refugee {{policies are}} expensive {{in the short term}} and damage our economic prospects in the long term. As a nation, can we really afford to maintain them?

In recent years there has been a significant increase in the amount of technological tools available to the teacher. These tools have facilitated new practices such as writing wikis, blogs, texting, social networking and now tweeting. These developments have taken place alongside the introduction of virtual learning environments (VLE). VLEs often attempt to replicate aspects of other social media, however it seems that both teachers and learners are supplementing their activities with tools that sit outside of these institutionally sanctioned environments. This chapter will explore a perceived gap in expectation and reality for both teachers and learners. The chapter further proposes to frame a larger debate on deterministic practices in HE with the question: Is there a 'technological push' or 'technological pull' policy being introduced in Higher Education, and <b>what</b> implications <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> for learning?...|$|R

It acts as a vehicle to illustrate a number of methods that we used to understand game implementation, culminating in a full reconstruction of the technique. The methods we cover include: 'traditional' research, along with its limitations in this context; code and data analysis; hypothesis testing; reconstruction. Through this positivist experimental approach, our results are both independently verifiable and repeatable. We also approach the complex context of early DRM, its hacks and workarounds by the player community, and what precipitated the design choices made for this particular game...|$|R

The customary system {{rules and regulations}} are being impaired through the adoption of conventional science, foreign technology and centralization of power. This thesis explores the place of Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) among fishers on the Ugandan side of Lake Victoria. In this era, LEK is under threat from global forces especially on environment. Local fishers had for decades managed Great Lakes fisheries under customary right-based systems. Fisheries therefore are not only seen {{as a source of}} livelihood but also a way of life. However, with global connectedness and increased demand for fish and fish products especially in the foreign markets, new-comers are joining fisheries every day. This has led to the race for fish and fishing space. In Great Lakes fisheries, governments with the help of other stakeholders such as the EU and the WB have designed new institutions, ideas and technology for better management. " The new approaches give priority to conventional science more than LEK. Modern Boats in African Great Lakes focuses on the implications of these new systems upon local settings.
