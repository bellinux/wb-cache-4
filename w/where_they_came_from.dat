5|$|The game follows on {{the events}} of the first game, in which funky aliens ToeJam and Earl crash landed on Earth. After {{managing}} to rebuild their spaceship and returning safely to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo soon learn that a bunch of Earthlings had stowed away on their craft and have now invaded Funkotron. With the humans spreading panic across the planet's citizens, even scaring the source of all funk, Lamont the Funkapotomus, away to another dimension, it is up to ToeJam and Earl {{to clean up the mess}} they've made and send all the Earthlings they brought with them back to <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} exactly the actual number or types of {{aircraft}} involved, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from,</b> or the complete history of the program. It is estimated that in 1985 the USAF had 26 MiGs (MiG-21s and MiG-23s as MiG-17s had already been phased out) {{and by the end}} of the program USAF had mainly MiG-21s.|$|E
25|$|It {{was banned}} {{due to the}} {{appearance}} of firearms throughout the episode, {{as well as a}} scene where Team Rocket's Meowth wears a mustache that looks too much like that of Adolf Hitler. The removal of this episode leads to continuity problems, as Ash captured 29 Tauros in this episode, and he got #30 from Brock with one of his Safari Balls. The Tauros appear in later episodes and are used in Pokémon Tournaments by Ash, and only one episode briefly alludes to <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although again hurt by players {{leaving to}} play pro football, Ohio State {{improved}} greatly in 1948, winning six games and losing {{three in a}} year when the Big Ten was an exceptionally strong conference. In 1949 the Buckeyes overcame an early lopsided loss to Minnesota to go on to a successful season, due in great part to the play of sophomore Vic Janowicz. Tying Michigan in Ann Arbor to become Big Ten co-champions, Ohio State also received the Rose Bowl invitation, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> behind to defeat California.|$|E
25|$|Chipatá was {{the first}} {{settlement}} of the later New Kingdom of Granada, founded by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada on March 8, 1537. Shortly after, the rested and reinforced troops set foot to higher terrains towards the south. Different from the scattered and unorganised indigenous groups they encountered before, advancing into the Muisca Confederation, they found a much better organised society and economy. The agriculture of the Muisca impressed the Spanish conquistadors and made them even more curious {{to find out who}} was the leader of the civilisation. While the Muisca regarded the European conquerors with distrust, they were also curious about them and <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from.</b>|$|E
25|$|Note {{that there}} is a big {{difference}} between pool types. Indoor pools of 25 m give the advantage of being able to use the turning point to push off again using ones legs, thus giving a clear advantage over 50 m and of course open water venues. Open sea gives the really bad side effect of large waves and the tides, which will sometimes push the swimmer back to <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from,</b> this can be clearly seen in the differences in times between the Channel crossing and the almost double in length Maraton Acuatica Rio Coronda which she performed in two hours less.|$|E

In the film, which was released on October 16, 2015, Hannah's father R. L. Stine keeps all the monsters in the series locked up in his books.

500|$|Meyer, a Mormon, {{acknowledges}} that her faith has influenced her work. In particular, {{she says that}} her characters [...] "tend to think more about <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from,</b> {{and where they are}} going, than might be typical." [...] Meyer also steers her work from subjects such as sex, despite the romantic nature of the novels. Meyer says that she does not consciously intend her novels to be Mormon-influenced, or to promote the virtues of sexual abstinence and spiritual purity, but admits that her writing is shaped by her values, saying, [...] "I don't think my books are going to be really graphic or dark, because of who I am. There's {{always going to be a}} lot of light in my stories." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, in the present, The Lone Gunmen inform Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{that they}} have lost contact with Mulder, who had set out {{in search of the}} Queen Anne. Scully first turns to Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), unsuccessfully, then {{attempts}} to confront Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.). She finally threatens Agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) before Skinner shows up and provides her with the information from the Pentagon. Scully leaves with the Gunmen to find Mulder. On the Queen Anne, a British sailor tells Mulder that the Germans are looking for what they believe is a weapon called [...] "Thor's Hammer". Mulder tells him that Thor's Hammer is not a weapon, but a scientist that will build a weapon. The sailor, however, {{turns out to be a}} German spy and locks Mulder in the engine room with the ship's crew. One of the sailors, who strongly resembles Kersh, decides to steer the boat to Jamaica, but Mulder tells them to sail back <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from,</b> in order to pass through the time warp and re-appear in 1998.|$|E

His sons, later known as the World Soul after a series of events will for the most part escape from matter and return again to the world of light <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from.</b> Manicheans often identified many of Mani's cosmological figures with Zoroastrian ones. This may be in part because Mani was born in the greatly Zoroastrian Parthian Empire.|$|E
2500|$|In Philadelphia, R {{musicians and}} audiences from the Black, Italian, and Latino {{communities}} adopted several traits from the hippie and psychedelia subcultures. They included using music venues with a loud, overwhelming sound, free-form dancing, trippy lighting, colorful costumes, {{and the use}} of hallucinogenic drugs. Psychedelic soul groups like the Chambers Brothers and especially Sly and the Family Stone influenced proto-disco acts such as Isaac Hayes, Willie Hutch and the soul style known as the Philadelphia Sound. In addition, the perceived positivity, lack of irony, and earnestness of the hippies informed proto-disco music like MFSB's album Love Is the Message. To the mainstream public M.F.S.B. stood for [...] "Mother Father Sister Brother"; to the tough areas <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> it was understood to stand for [...] "Mother Fuckin' Son of a Bitch", a reference to their playing skill and musical prowess.|$|E
