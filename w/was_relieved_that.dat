5|$|The Reds {{were the}} NL champions in 1961, {{and with the}} {{addition}} of Sisler, Dave Hillman, and Moe Drabowsky to ensure stability to their pitching staff in 1962, the team's management had high hopes of a return to the World Series. Sisler, who was expected {{to be used as a}} relief pitcher, joined a Reds team that already had his brother Dick, who was their first base coach. His father, still with Pittsburgh, mentioned that he <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> his son did not play in a recent series between the Pirates and Reds, recalling how the mixed emotions he felt when his elder son, Dick, helped defeat the Dodgers in an important game in 1950 by hitting a home run. The younger Sisler's season did not begin well; in his ten appearances by June 5, he allowed a run in all but three, and had a 4.97 ERA. On June19, Sisler pitched a scoreless inning in victory against the Pirates, the time first time George watched his son pitch as an opponent. Although Sisler's season was a disappointment, he completed the season well, allowing just one earned run over the course of his final eight games, as well as earning the victory on September23, his final major league appearance. His totals for the season included a 4–3record, a 3.92ERA, and one save in 43⅔innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days after}} leaving Grimsby Town, Beharall {{was on the}} move again, this time to Oldham Athletic on a loan deal {{to the end of}} the season. Beharall made his dèbut in a 0–0 draw against Stoke City on 21 November 2001. He played 17 league games, two FA Cup and two Football League Trophy matches during his loan spell at Oldham, scoring one goal in the 89th minute in a 1–1 draw against Wigan Athletic on 15 December 2001. Beharall was bought by Oldham Athletic on 6 March 2002 for £150,000 on a three-year {{contract}} after impressing during his loan deal. David played one more league game for The Latics during the 2001–02 season against Wigan on 9 March, a match which Wigan won 1–0. In the 2002–03 season Beharall played 32 league, 4 League and 3 FA Cup games for Oldham under the management of Iain Dowie, who replaced Mick Wadsworth in the summer of 2002. In the pre-season of the 2003–04 season, he suffered an injury which left him out of action until October 2003. During this time in August 2003 Beharall was a victim of a carjacking when he and team mate Adam Griffin were attacked when they stopped at a cash machine with Beharall leaving Grffin in the passenger seat and his £21,000 Mercedes-Benz R230 car parked at a Texaco garage in Oldham. Griffin was left defenseless with one of the attackers holding him at knifepoint and another man hit Griffin's left arm with an iron bar, then dragging and throwing Griffin to the ground. Beharall left his wallet and mobile phone in the car but <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> he and Griffin were OK. During the 2003–2004 season Beharall played 7 league, 2 FA Cup and 2 Football league games, he also scored 2 league goals against Plymouth Argyle on 1 November 2003. After playing only 6 league games during the 2004–05 season new manager Brian Talbot, Beharall left the club on 24 January 2005 after agreeing a settlement figure.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{attempted}} {{to renew the}} offensive on 5 April. By now 47th Division had reorganised. Most of 1/19th was with 141 Bde in divisional reserve, but one company was in the front line still attached to 1/20th. The attack was made after an intense bombardment, and fighting went on all day, with reserves fed in progressively. The Germans made some gains, but the line held. 47th Division <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> night.|$|E

25|$|In late 1938, {{during the}} great crisis in Europe over Czechoslovakia that culminated in the Munich Agreement, Canadians were divided. Francophones insisted on neutrality, as did some top {{advisers}} like Oscar D. Skelton. Imperialists stood behind Britain and were willing to fight Germany. King, who served as his own {{secretary of state for}} external affairs (foreign minister), said privately that if he had to choose he would not be neutral, but he made no public statement. All of Canada <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> the British appeasement at Munich, while sacrificing the rights of Czechoslovakia, seemed to bring peace.|$|E
25|$|On January 9, 2007, Gwynn {{was elected}} to the Baseball Hall of Fame, being {{selected}} on 532 out of 545 ballots (97.61%), the seventh highest percentage in Hall of Fame voting history. He <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> he did not exceed Tom Seaver's record of 98.8 percent. Gwynn considered his selection to be validation for the value of contact hitters, who are not as celebrated as power hitters. He was inducted alongside Cal Ripken Jr. on July 29, 2007. Ripken and Gwynn are two of the 46 players in the Hall of Fame who played their entire major league career for only one team. Both were elected almost unanimously in their first year of eligibility.|$|E
25|$|For 18 years Hersey {{also taught}} two writing courses, in fiction and non-fiction, to undergraduates. Hersey taught his last class in fiction writing at Yale during 1984. In his {{individual}} sessions with undergraduates {{to discuss their}} work, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author was sometimes known to write his comments in the margin, and having discussed his suggestion with the student, to then take out his pencil and erase his comment. As Master of Pierson College, he subsequently hosted his old boss Henry Luce– with whom Hersey had become reconciled after their dispute years prior– when Luce spoke to the college's undergraduates. Time founder Luce was a notoriously dull public speaker, and his address to the Pierson undergraduates was no exception. After Luce's somnolent speech, the former publisher privately revealed to Hersey {{for the first time}} that he and his wife Clare Boothe Luce had taken LSD while supervised by a physician. Hersey later confessed he <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> Luce had saved that particular revelation for a more private audience.|$|E

500|$|Spiegelman {{struggled}} to find a publisher for a book edition of Maus, but after a rave New York Times review of the serial in August 1986, Pantheon Books published the first six chapters in a volume called Maus: A Survivor's Tale and subtitled My Father Bleeds History. [...] Spiegelman <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> the book's publication preceded the theatrical release of the animated film An American Tail by three months, as {{he believed that the}} film, produced by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, was inspired by Maus and wished to avoid comparisons with it.|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} the fall of Le Quesnoy, {{elements}} of the division moved through the Mormal Forest with the 1st Canterbury and 2nd Otago Battalions of the 2nd Brigade leading the way.

Twenty men were killed in this last contact with the enemy, which marked the last offensive action of the division; it <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> night.

500|$|This episode {{originally}} {{aired on}} May 7, 1987, on NBC at 9:00pm (Eastern) / 8:00pm (Central) and scored a 28.4 rating and 45 share, was watched by 24.8 million homes, and ranked #1 in Nielsen ratings. After the episode originally aired, Kathy Carlisle of Los Angeles Times called this episode [...] "hilarious, but somewhat contrived and very disappointing" [...] {{and felt that}} Sam and Diane should have been married at the end. Monica Collins from USA Today called Diane a [...] "snitty, selfish snob" [...] and <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> the character left the series. According to Collins, she has not made friends with people in Cheers onscreen. More often, she has not befriended women, and she has [...] " [...] men more than [...] them".|$|E

500|$|Visual effect {{supervisors}} Gary Hutzel and Glenn Neufeld {{were busy}} completing post-production {{work on the}} opening episode of the fourth season, [...] "". In their place, visual effects coordinator David Takemura led on the visual effects work on both [...] "Rejoined" [...] and [...] "". For this episode, his two main tasks were {{the creation of the}} artificial wormhole and the sequence where Dax uses a forcefield as a walkway to reach a trapped Kahn. Takemura <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> the wormhole was intended to be artificial in nature, as it meant {{that he did not have}} to attempt to re-create the detail already seen in the Bajoran wormhole on the series. Once he came up with the basic design, visual effects company VisionArt completed it.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{screened}} for the producers in October 1926 {{who did not}} approve of it, {{and it was not}} until after the success of Hitchcock's [...] that they released the film in May 1927. The film was poorly received and criticised for its lack of realism, and Hitchcock himself <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> the film was lost. Six surviving stills of The Mountain Eagle are reproduced in François Truffaut's book, and further stills have been found to exist. In 2012, a set of 24 still photographs were found in an archive of one of Hitchcock's close friends. The Cine Tirol Film Commission has described it as [...] "the most wanted film in the world", and the British Film Institute has the film on the top of their list of missing films and is actively searching for it.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} intended Cheers to be {{a comedy}} about a comedy itself set in the Boston bar, but, as Burrows claimed, the [...] "Sam and Diane" [...] story arc predominated the show for five years and, as he hypothesized, {{would have made the}} bar more of a minor role and more irrelevant if Shelley Long had not left the show as Diane Chambers in 1987. With Diane written out in [...] "I Do, Adieu" [...] and Long departing the series, the producers planned to revamp the show's format without losing the bar, which has been their choice of intent, and then <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> the series would survive without Shelley Long. As Les Charles observed, Sam was a [...] "straight man" [...] to Diane; with Diane gone, they made him more [...] "carefree" [...] and a [...] "goof-off." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{script was}} later rewritten and {{expanded}} when Lynch decided to {{transform it into}} a feature film. Describing the transition from an open-ended pilot to a feature film with a resolution of sorts, Lynch said, [...] "One night, I sat down, the ideas came in, {{and it was a}} most beautiful experience. Everything was seen from a different angle... Now, looking back, I see that [...] always wanted to be this way. It just took this strange beginning to cause it to be what it is." [...] The result was an extra eighteen pages of material that included the romantic relationship between Rita and Betty and the events that occurred after the blue box was opened. Watts <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> the pilot was dropped by ABC. She found Betty too one-dimensional without the darker portion of the film that was put together afterward. Most of the new scenes were filmed in October 2000, funded with $7million from French production company StudioCanal.|$|E
500|$|Fish created pixel art in Photoshop {{for each}} tiled side ("trile") of the 3D trixel that Bédard's custom {{software}} compiled into 3D game assets, which Fish would extrude as surfaces in Fezzer to build levels. Fish found the level design process [...] "overwhelming", and Bédard {{has said he}} <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> {{it was not his}} job. Fish compared his design process to playing with Lego blocks, and planned the more involved levels in graph paper to first visualize the 2D views before building the levels in the 3D software. The levels and puzzles were not preordained in a design document, and many of the drafts levels scrapped in 2008 resurfaced to be used later in the production process. So as to fit the rotation mechanic, the levels were made tall instead of wide, and {{the first part of the}} game was designed to acclimate the player to 2D controls before introducing the 3D element. As they worked, Fish first proposed ideas that Bédard would implement. The two would then discuss and fine-tune the addition—they worked well together.|$|E
500|$|He made an {{impressive}} start for Sunderland, scoring a hat-trick {{on his home}} debut at Roker Park against Sheffield Wednesday, including a typically physical finish for one goal, taking Wednesday goalkeeper Dave McIntosh across the line with the ball, and later breaking a post with one effort. Despite being the most expensive footballer in British history, Ford continued {{to work as a}} car salesman for the Sunderland chairman in his spare time after training to earn extra money. In March 1951, Ford's record transfer fee was broken, following the transfer of Jackie Sewell from Notts County to Sheffield Wednesday for a fee of £34,500. Ford revealed that he <b>was</b> <b>relieved</b> <b>that</b> the record had been broken having described the fee as [...] "weighing heavy on his shoulders". During the 1952–53 season, the club turned down a bid from Italian side Fiorentina for Ford. Ford had been keen on completing the transfer, which would have seen the him earning £2,000 a year each with a £35 match win bonus as well as the club buying each player a house.|$|E
