5|$|November 3, 2007– Moderate winds {{from the}} extratropical {{remnants}} of Hurricane Noel leave about 6,000people <b>without</b> <b>power</b> in the state.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 35 power crews, along with outside contractors, worked to restore power. By {{two days after}} the storm, 2,000 {{remained}} <b>without</b> <b>power</b> in scattered areas. Various locations in the city of Dover were <b>without</b> <b>power</b> for about 30hours. There, the removal of debris exceeded the capacity of the local landfall, resulting in officials temporarily storing it elsewhere. Over 200volunteers donated time, food and money to provide hot meals for individuals and families affected by the storm. Support teams provided by county officials transported over 300 tons of ruined accessories from the storm, such as appliances, carpets, and drywall, to local landfills. Qualifying for two NASCAR races in Dover were cancelled due to the hurricane, although the races went on as scheduled.|$|E

5|$|On St. Croix, waves up to 15ft (4.5m) from Omar sank about 47 boats, {{leading to}} a large oil spill around the islands. About 400 ships broke lose from the docks, 200 of which lost their anchors. Omar {{produced}} upwards of 7in (177.8mm) of rain on the island within a 24‑hour span. Although St. Croix was brushed by the eyewall, sustained winds reached 53mph (85km/h) with gusts to 72mph (116km/h). Three people needed to be rescued when their ship struck a reef and began to sink. Most of the islands 55,000 residents were <b>without</b> <b>power</b> as over 100 utility poles were destroyed. Damages on the island were estimated at $700,000 with another $1million in clean-up costs. St. Thomas, {{one of the hardest}} hit islands, was left completely <b>without</b> <b>power</b> {{in the wake of the}} hurricane. All of the major intersections were shut down as traffic lights were either on the ground or <b>without</b> <b>power.</b> Damages on the island totaled to $5.3million.|$|E

5|$|Severe impacts from Earl in Antigua and Barbuda {{amounted}} to EC $34million ($12.6 millionUSD). One person was electrocuted trying to restore power. Wind gusts neared or surpassed hurricane force across Guadeloupe and the French islands, peaking at 105mph (169km/h) in Gustavia. Approximately 7,500 residents were left <b>without</b> <b>power</b> across Saint Martin, Saint Barthelemy, and Guadeloupe. Heavy rainfall and strong wind gusts battered Saint Kitts and Nevis, leaving streets flooded and many residences <b>without</b> <b>power.</b> In the British Leeward Islands, wind gusts up to 88mph (142km/h) {{damaged or destroyed}} dozens of structures, resulting in up to $7 million in damage. Substantial effects were also observed in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where total infrastructure losses were placed at $2.5 million and revenue losses from deterred vacationers reached $10.7 million. Flooding and downed power lines in Puerto Rico left 187,000 residents <b>without</b> <b>power</b> and an additional 60,000 without water access. As Earl paralleled the East Coast of the United States, it produced varying degrees of impact; North Carolina was hardest hit, with over $3.5 million in damage. Three {{people were killed in}} rough seas off Florida, one person was killed by rough seas off Maine, and two people were killed by rip currents off New Jersey. Approximately 940,000 people were left <b>without</b> <b>power</b> across Nova Scotia and surrounding areas, where one death occurred.|$|E
5|$|The gusty winds {{from the}} passage of the {{hurricane}} resulted in widespread and extensive tree damage. Due to previous rainfall, moist grounds easily allowed for trees to be uprooted. Wind damage to structures was minor, however, with one house in Carroll County being damaged when a tree fell on it. Trees fell onto cars, roads, homes, and power lines, leaving 358,000 <b>without</b> <b>power</b> after the storm. 600traffic signals were <b>without</b> <b>power</b> in Montgomery County, and about 70roads were closed due to fallen trees. Isabel destroyed 94buildings and damaged 87, including 33homes, six of which were severely impacted with one losing a portion of its roof. Fallen trees injured two in Frederick County. In western Maryland, damage totaled $2.07million (2003USD, ($ USD).|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Dean dropped heavy {{rainfall}} across Puerto Rico, peaking at 12.7inches (322mm) in Salinas. Winds were generally light across the island. The passage of Dean resulted in widespread flooding in {{eastern and southern}} Puerto Rico, collapsing two bridges and one road. Several highways were under water, and one car was swept away by the floodwaters. The four inside the vehicle were later rescued and unharmed. Throughout the island, about 1,320houses were flooded, and two houses experienced collapsed roofs. The rains left various towns <b>without</b> <b>power</b> or water. By the night after the storm passed the island, more than 16,000 were <b>without</b> <b>power,</b> while almost 70,000 lacked potable water. Over 130people were evacuated from low-lying areas to hurricane shelters.|$|E

5|$|With {{most of its}} {{circulation}} {{over the}} western portion of Florida during its existence, Tropical Storm Marco produced 39–74mph winds across western Florida. As it brushed the coastline, the storm developed strong convective rain bands, leading to peak sustained winds of 69mph (112km/h) with gusts to 85mph (137km/h) on the Sunshine Skyway Bridge; the bridge was closed after gusts reached 70mph (115km/h). Squalls from the storm spawned four tornadoes in the state, one of which struck the city of Crystal River, destroying a mobile home and left 2,000people <b>without</b> <b>power</b> for about an hour. Storm damage left about 25,000customers across the state <b>without</b> <b>power</b> and about 40families temporarily homeless.|$|E
5|$|Although {{no longer}} a {{tropical}} cyclone, {{the remnants of the}} depression brought moderate rainfall to parts of Sinaloa, Nayarit and Jalisco. High winds accompanied the rainfall and left about 50,000 residences <b>without</b> <b>power.</b> Several trees were downed and some structures sustained damage from fresh water flooding. Landslides occurred along major highways and significant structural damage was reported around Mazatlán. However, there was no loss of life or reports of injuries.|$|E

5|$|For several days, Gert {{threatened}} to strike Bermuda, prompting {{the evacuation of}} tourists. Although Gert's center did not make landfall, it passed a short distance east of the island, producing hurricane-force winds that left 11,000people <b>without</b> <b>power.</b> High waves swept two people out to sea at Acadia National Park in Maine. Later, strong waves struck Newfoundland and left heavy marine damage.|$|E

50|$|The terms {{hot plug}} and cold plug {{can be taken}} to mean two {{different}} things, depending on the context.

In the context of comparing certain hot-pluggable devices, however, hot plug {{can be taken to}} mean the ability of the system to autonomously detect the addition or removal of hardware as it occurs, while cold plug can be taken to mean the ability to add or remove devices <b>without</b> <b>powering</b> down or rebooting the system, but the inability of the system to detect these changes, in which case the system operator would have to tell the system software that the change has occurred.|$|R
