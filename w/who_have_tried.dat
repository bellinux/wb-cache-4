25|$|Terry Brink, {{a student}} of Alfred Adler, {{published}} an essay The case of Hitler (1975) in which he, similar to the above-mentioned authors, concluded that after a conscientious evaluation of all records there is not sufficient evidence that Hitler had a mental disorder. Many of Hitler's behavior must be understood as attempts to overcome a difficult childhood. However, many of the documents and statements that have been quoted in order to proof a mental illness were to be considered untrustworthy. Too strong consideration has been given, for example, to allied propaganda and to fabrications of people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> {{to distance themselves from}} Hitler for personal reasons.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} {{those who have}} DSPD seek medical help, they usually have tried many times to change their {{sleeping}} schedule. Failed tactics to sleep at earlier times may include maintaining proper sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, early bedtimes, hypnosis, alcohol, sleeping pills, dull reading, and home remedies. DSPD patients <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> using sedatives at night often report that the medication makes them feel tired or relaxed, but that it fails to induce sleep. They often have asked family members to help wake them in the morning, or they have used multiple alarm clocks. As the disorder occurs in childhood and is most common in adolescence, it is often the patient's parents who initiate seeking help, after great difficulty waking their child in time for school.|$|E

500|$|Operation Epsom {{has been}} {{analysed}} by many military historians and commentators. S. A. Hart wrote in 2007, that post-war publication of memoirs by Allied generals {{had led to}} disputes along national lines during the 1950s and 1960s, with American historians generally critical of Montgomery and {{the actions of the}} Anglo-Canadian forces, while [...] "pro-Montgomery" [...] historians set out to refute these criticisms. Also published during this period were the national official campaign histories, which were thoroughly-researched but avoided detailed critical analysis of the controversies. During the 1980s, revisionist writers concentrated on the perceived deficiencies of the Allies and since the late 1990s, two schools of thought have been revising the revisionists, some expanding on revisionist work, by providing a more detailed campaign analysis and those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to show that the techniques employed by the Anglo-Canadian forces were appropriate to conditions in Normandy.|$|E
500|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate {{diet that}} in medicine is used primarily to treat difficult-to-control (refractory) epilepsy in children. The diet forces {{the body to}} burn fats rather than carbohydrates. Normally, the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into glucose, which is then transported around the body and is particularly important in fueling brain-function. However, if {{there is very little}} carbohydrate in the diet, the liver converts fat into fatty acids and ketone bodies. The ketone bodies pass into the brain and replace glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood, a state known as ketosis, leads to a reduction in the frequency of epileptic seizures. Almost half of children, and young people, with epilepsy <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> some form of this diet saw the number of seizures drop by at least half, and the effect persists even after discontinuing the diet. There is some evidence that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet, and that a less strict regimen, such as a modified Atkins diet, is similarly effective. [...] The most common adverse effect is constipation, affecting about 30% of patients—this was due to fluid restriction, which was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E
500|$|Lucius's {{apparently}} solemn {{devotion to}} the Isis cult in this chapter contrasts strongly with the comic misadventures {{that make up the}} rest of the novel. Scholars debate whether the account is intended to seriously represent Lucius's {{devotion to the}} goddess, or whether it is ironic, perhaps a satire of the Isis cult. Those who believe it is satirical point to the way Lucius is pushed to undergo several initiations, each requiring a fee, despite having little money. Although many of the scholars <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to analyze the mysteries based on the book have assumed it is serious, the book may be broadly accurate even if it is satirical. Apuleius's description of the Isis cult and its mysteries generally fits with much of the outside evidence about them. S.J. Harrison says it shows [...] "detailed knowledge of Egyptian cult, whether or not Apuleius himself was in fact an initiate of Isiac religion." [...] In another of his works, the Apologia, Apuleius claims to have undergone several initiations, though he does not mention the mysteries of Isis specifically. In writing Metamorphoses, he may have drawn on personal experience of the Isiac initiation or of other initiations that he underwent. Even so, the detailed description given in Metamorphoses may be idealized rather than strictly accurate, and the Isis cults may have included many varieties of mystery rite. The novel actually mentions three distinct initiation rites in two cities, although only the first is described in any detail.|$|E

2500|$|The {{causes of}} secession were complex {{and have been}} {{controversial}} since the war began, but most academic scholarsidentifyslavery as a central cause of the war. [...] James C.

Slavery was the central source of escalating political tension in the 1850s. The Republican Party was determined to prevent any spread of slavery, and many Southern leaders had threatened secession if the Republican candidate, Lincoln, won the 1860 election. After Lincoln won many Southern leaders [...] felt that disunion had become their only option, because they thought that they were losing representation, which would hamper their ability to promote pro-slavery acts and policies.|$|E

2500|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson {{comments}} {{that the existence}} of nine worlds around Yggdrasil is mentioned more than once in Old Norse sources, but the identity of the worlds is never stated outright, though it can be deduced from various sources. Davidson {{comments that}} [...] "no doubt the identity of the nine varied from time to time as the emphasis changed or new imagery arrived". Davidson says that it is unclear where the nine worlds are located in relation to the tree; they could either exist one above the other or perhaps be grouped around the tree, but there are references to worlds existing beneath the tree, while the gods are pictured as in the sky, a rainbow bridge (Bifröst) connecting the tree with other worlds.
