5|$|Edward William Bastard (28 February 1862 – 2 April 1901) was an English {{first-class}} cricketer {{who played}} for Oxford University and Somerset. Bastard <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> left-arm orthodox bowler, described in his Wisden obituary as Somerset's best bowler during his time with the club. Bastard was {{also part of the}} Oxford team often said to be the university's best ever.|$|E
5|$|John Scott Haldane was {{commissioned}} by the Royal Navy to develop a safe decompression procedure. The current method <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> linear decompression, and Haldane was concerned that this was ineffective due to additional nitrogen buildup in the slow {{early stages of the}} ascent.|$|E

5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear on its hind legs. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fariña (1999), who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which is adapted to galloping.|$|E
5|$|EK Trianguli Australis, a dwarf nova of the SU Ursae Majoris type, {{was first}} noticed in 1978 and officially {{described}} in 1980. It {{consists of a}} white dwarf and a donor star which orbit each other every 1.5 hours. The white dwarf sucks matter from the other star onto an accretion disc and periodically erupts, reaching magnitude 11.2 in superoutbursts, 12.1 in normal outbursts and remaining at magnitude 16.7 when quiet. Nova Trianguli Australis 2008 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> nova which peaked at magnitude 8.4 in April 2008, before fading to magnitude 12.4 by September of that year.|$|E
5|$|John, like Basil II before him, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> {{but steady}} campaigner. His armies made careful, {{measured}} gains over time, rarely exposing themselves to excessive risks, but nevertheless advancing inexorably towards their objectives. However, the Turks were resilient, {{and they did}} not allow themselves to be decisively defeated in any one engagement. They knew that it was difficult for the emperor to remain in one theatre of war for a long time, as events elsewhere often intervened that required his attention.|$|E

5|$|The Sholes and Glidden was {{the first}} commercially {{successful}} typewriter. Industrialization and corporate growth in the late 19th century produced a business environment for which the device was well suited. New communications technologies, such as the telegraph and telephone, facilitated geographic expansion and increased {{the speed with which}} business was conducted. The resulting increase in the volume of correspondence required messages to be produced quickly and legibly. Before the typewriter, clerks and copyists could write relatively quickly in shorthand or longhand. The comprehension of these scripts, however, required either special training or close concentration. Typesetting was used when legibility was important, but it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> and expensive process. The typewriter succeeded because it simultaneously addressed both issues.|$|E
5|$|No Code sold 366,500copies in {{its first}} week of release, topping the Billboard 200, but falling short of analysts' {{predictions}} of at least 535,000 copies. This was significantly less than what the band's previous two albums sold in their respective first weeks of release. It was, however, the seventh biggest-selling debut of what <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> year for the industry. It stayed at number one for two weeks, and was Pearl Jam's last album to debut at {{number one on the}} album chart until Backspacer was released in 2009. No Code was the band's first album to not reach multi-platinum status, being certified platinum by the RIAA, and, as of 2013, has sold 1.75 millioncopies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E
5|$|On 18 May 2014, Hammett {{was named}} Director of Rugby for Wales-based team Cardiff Blues, working {{alongside}} Dale McIntosh and Paul John. The Mark Hammett era <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> start, losing both the pre-season friendlies. However, {{the first round}} saw Cardiff defeat Zebre 41–26. Despite only winning one game in his first competitive 6 games, Hammett lead Cardiff to a surprise victory over French side Grenoble and an easy victory over Rovigo Delta in the 2014–15 European Rugby Challenge Cup. These games were backed-up by a narrow loss to Irish giants Munster. On 24 January 2015, Hammett led the Blues to an away victory over Grenoble, to see the side through to the quarter-finals of the 2014–15 European Rugby Challenge Cup. On 20 February 2015, Cardiff were beaten by Benetton Treviso 40–24 in Treviso, which later {{turned out to be}} Hammett's last game in charge of the Welsh side. On 25 February 2015, after six months of a three-year contract, Cardiff Blues agreed to release Hammett at his request for personal reasons, to allow him to return home to New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Wukong <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> moving {{tropical}} cyclone which produced torrential rains over Japan. The tenth named storm of the 2006 Pacific typhoon season, Wukong developed {{out of a}} tropical depression over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. On August13, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the depression as a tropical storm. The storm traveled along a curving path south of Japan, absorbing the remnants of Tropical Storm Sonamu on August15 before turning towards the west. Wukong made landfall at peak intensity late on August17 near Miyazaki City in southern Kyūshū. The cyclone remained over land for about 24hours before moving out over the Sea of Japan. The storm weakened to a tropical depression before dissipating on August21. Due to the slow movement of the storm, it produced heavy rains, peaking at 516mm (20.3in). Two people were killed due to rough seas produced by the storm and three others were injured.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Bastille as {{a prison}} changed {{considerably}} during the reigns of Louis XV and XVI. One trend was {{a decline in the}} number of prisoners sent to the Bastille, with only 1,194 imprisoned there during the reign of Louis XV and only 306 under Louis XVI up until the Revolution, annual averages of around 23 and 20 respectively. A second trend <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> shift away from the Bastille's 17th-century role of detaining primarily upper-class prisoners, towards a situation in which the Bastille was essentially a location for imprisoning socially undesirable individuals of all backgrounds – including aristocrats breaking social conventions, criminals, pornographers, thugs – and was used to support police operations, particularly those involving censorship, across Paris. Despite these changes, the Bastille remained a state prison, subject to special authorities, answering to the monarch of the day and surrounded by a considerable and threatening reputation.|$|E
5|$|Without {{aircraft}} aboard, she {{sailed to}} Alexandria on 23 January escorted by four destroyers, for temporary repairs that lasted until 10 March. Boyd {{was promoted to}} rear admiral on 18 February and relieved Lyster as Rear Admiral Aircraft Carriers. He transferred his flag to Formidable when she arrived at Alexandria on 10 March, just before Illustrious sailed for Port Said to begin her transit of the Suez Canal. The Germans had laid mines in the canal earlier. Clearing the mines and the ships sunk by them <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> process and Illustrious did not reach Suez Bay until 20 March. The ship then sailed for Durban, South Africa, to have the extent of her underwater damage assessed in the drydock there. She reached Durban on 4 April and remained there for two weeks. The ship ultimately arrived at the Norfolk Navy Yard in the United States on 12 May for permanent repairs.|$|E
