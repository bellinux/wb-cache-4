25|$|Turón, {{one of the}} locales of anticlerical violence, a coal-mining town in the Asturias Province, was a hub of anti-government and anticlerical agitation. The De La Salle Brothers, who ran {{a school}} there, angered the leftists who ran Turón, because of their {{exercise}} of religion and their flouting of the constitutional prohibition on religious instruction. On October 5, 1934, the agents of the local rebel government invaded the order's residence on the pretext that they had concealed weapons. A Passionist priest, Father Inocencio, now Saint Innocencio of Mary Immaculate, who had arrived the evening of October 4 <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Mass for the brothers. He and the brothers were taken and held without trial and summarily shot {{in the middle of}} the night in the cemetery.|$|E
25|$|After Sigismund III {{was elected}} in 1587, Elizabeth's {{intelligence}} service gave notice that an ambassador was in transit and that the deputation was one of amity. On 23 July 1587, the Privy Council instructed the Lord Mayor of London to arrange housing for the diplomat, preferably with a merchant prominent in the Baltic trade. To ensure Elizabeth would not find fault with the preparations, the Lord Mayor was to report the arrangements made. Two days later a Polish envoy, Paweł Działyński, arrived at the palace in Greenwich. Brought to the reception hall, he found Elizabeth sitting on the throne under the canopy of state with all her nobles in attendance. The ambassador presented his credentials, and kissed the Queen's hand extended to him―a gesture of royal favour. Działyński then strode to {{the centre of the}} chamber without any forewarning of what he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and, instead of the oration of a legate that everyone anticipated, he couched in respectful words to flatter the monarch being addressed and spoke as a herald. In Latin, he hectored, admonished and criticized the queen, and declared an ultimatum of capitulation to terms or hostile action.|$|E
500|$|Campling {{and other}} critics have commented {{that one of the}} main {{features}} of the show is the ability of the locals to laugh at themselves and their eccentricities. Campling wrote of the Skipton show: [...] "The ability to laugh at itself is one of this country's finest attributes, but the Skipton mob were only too happy to celebrate their insularity." [...] Elisabeth Mahoney of The Guardian, who reviewed the Dartford episode, said: [...] "Going to a place and insulting it takes guts and careful strategies. Steel made use {{of the fact that he}} is from nearby Swanley, both to signal that he knows the area but also that – whatever he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about Dartford – it was better than his hometown." [...] Another journalist, reviewing the Penzance episode in the North Devon Journal commented: [...] "Why do we like programmes that laugh at us? Because, I hope, we laugh at ourselves. We're not ignorant of our stereotypes. West Cornwall? Aaarrrrr!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In Dublin in 1952 Erwin Schrödinger gave {{a lecture}} in which {{at one point}} he jocularly warned his {{audience}} that what he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> might [...] "seem lunatic". It was that, when his Nobel equations seem to be describing several different histories, they are [...] "not alternatives but all really happen simultaneously". This is the earliest known reference to the Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.|$|E
2500|$|Saddam {{began to}} recite the Shahada twice. As he neared {{the end of his}} second recitation when he <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Muhammad, the {{trapdoor}} sprang. According to The New York Times, the executioners [...] "cheer their Shi'ite heroes so persistently that one observer [...] makes a remark about how the effort to rein in militias {{does not seem to be}} going well." [...] During the drop there was an audible crack indicating that his neck was broken. After Saddam was suspended for a few minutes, the doctor present listened with a stethoscope for a heartbeat. After he detected none, the rope was cut, and the body was placed in a coffin. He was confirmed dead at 06:03.|$|E
2500|$|In Elizabeth's early life, she {{periodically}} blacked out. [...] This {{happened in}} the third grade, when she <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> her lines in a Christmas play, and recurred throughout her life. [...] Her condition was first diagnosed as petit mal epilepsy, known more commonly today as absence seizures. [...] She did not find medication helpful, and discontinued using it. [...] Her mother later confessed that in 1937 she took some pills in an unsuccessful attempt to abort her pregnancy with Elizabeth. [...] Prophet thought {{that her mother was}} implying that the medication may have contributed to her childhood blackouts. [...] Prophet herself did some research, and learned that the use of quinine sulfate could have damaged the developing nervous system and the brain.|$|E

2500|$|Finally the companions of Hasan al-Askari, the {{eleventh}} Imam, also {{believed he had}} a son whose birth, {{like that of the}} prophet Moses was concealed, and due to the belief that he was the promised Muhammad al-Mahdi; Al-Mutamid ordered the house of the Imam to be investigated, and {{to find out if the}} Imam had left a son. It is said that when his uncle, who became known as the [...] "Ja'far the liar" [...] afterwards, <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the prayer at Hasan al-Askari's funeral, [...] "a fair child, with curly hair, and shining teeth" [...] appeared and seized his uncle's cloak insisting that he himself should say the prayer. And when a few days later a group of Shia pilgrims came from Qum to visit al-Askari, who was dead then, the same Ja'far claimed to be the next Imam. The pilgrims said they would accept him if he would prove himself by telling them their names and indicating how much money they had. While Ja'far was protesting against this examination, a servant of al-Mahdi appeared saying that his master had informed him to say that they had certain particular names and definite amount of money. Ja'far searched everywhere but could not find the boy, al-Mahdi." ...|$|E
