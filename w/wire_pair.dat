From the outside, they observed the station's antenna inside a military facility, the Warrenton Training Center. The station hunter speculated that the antenna's transmitter at the facility was connected by a telephone <b>wire</b> <b>pair</b> to a source of spoken numbers in the Washington, D.C. area.

25|$|Traditional {{telephone}} switches connected physical circuits (e.g., wire pairs) while modern telephone switches use {{a combination}} of space- and time-division switching. In other words, each voice channel is represented by a time slot (say 1 or 2) on a physical <b>wire</b> <b>pair</b> (A or B). In order to connect two voice channels (say A1 and B2) together, the telephone switch interchanges the information between A1 and B2. It switches both the time slot and physical connection. To do this, it exchanges data between the time slots and connections 8,000 times per second, under control of digital logic that cycles through electronic lists of the current connections. Using both types of switching makes a modern switch far smaller than either a space or time switch could be by itself.|$|E

50|$|Demand {{priority}} helps increase bandwidth in {{the following}} ways: A node {{does not need to}} keep checking whether the network is idle before transmitting. In current Ethernet implementations, a <b>wire</b> <b>pair</b> is dedicated to this task. By making network checking unnecessary, demand priority frees a <b>wire</b> <b>pair.</b> This is fortunate,because the 100BaseVG specifications use quartet signalling, which needs four available wire pairs.

40|$|International audienceMetamaterials made of {{exclusively}} metallic cut <b>wire</b> <b>pairs</b> {{have been}} experimentally demonstrated to exhibit a negative refractive index at optical frequencies. However, other related works have not shown a negative index. In this paper, we propose {{an easy way}} to manipulate the magnetic and electric resonances of these metamaterials to produce a negative index.

50|$|Near-End Crosstalk (NEXT) is {{an error}} {{condition}} {{that describes the}} occurrence of a signal from one <b>wire</b> <b>pair</b> radiating to and interfering with the signal of another <b>wire</b> <b>pair.</b> It is the difference in amplitude (in dB) between a transmitted signal and the crosstalk received on other cable pairs at the same end of the cabling. Higher NEXT values correspond to better cabling performance. A higher value is desirable as it would indicate that the power transmitted is greater in magnitude than the power induced onto another <b>wire</b> <b>pair</b> given that the NEXT measurement is simply a difference calculation. NEXT must be measured from each pair to each other pair in twisted pair cabling and from {{each end of the}} connection. NEXT is measured 30 meters (about 98 feet) from the injector / generator. Higher near end crosstalk values correspond to higher overall circuit performance. Low NEXT values on a UTP LAN that will be using an older signaling standard (IEEE 802.3i and earlier) are particularly detrimental.It could be an indication of improper termination.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the coupling of gap plasmons in various configurations of neighboring metallic nanowires. Starting {{with the basic}} element defining a gap plasmon, consisting of two neighboring silver wires, we study the energy splitting and symmetry properties of hybridized plasmons resulting from the interaction of two <b>wire</b> <b>pairs.</b> The system is shown to display non-avoided crossings of hybridized modes, and it evolves at short distances towards a degenerate system consisting of four wires arranged in a square, where two new gap plasmons emerge from redshifted higher-energy modes. The gap modes of three neighboring wires are also described in a continuous transition from a coplanar configuration to an equilateral triangle arrangement. The interaction between <b>wire</b> <b>pairs</b> is shown to be weak enough to prevent efficient transfer of plasmon signal from a pair to the other one, which is beneficial to avoid crosstalking, but not to produce waveguide couplers. The coupling is significantly increased by placing a wire of rectangular cross section in between the <b>wire</b> <b>pairs,</b> thus allowing us to achieve large plasmon-signal transfers within propagation distances below the attenuation length.
