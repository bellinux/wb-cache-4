In addition to an integration effect, social participation in, for example, extracurricular organisations provides knowledge and skills, which can be profitably incorporated in other social contexts, such as school and work.

These arrests are reversible in nature, unless the damage is too excessive. Here we find that checkpoint reversibility is lost in cells that are in very late G 2, but not yet fully committed to enter mitosis (antephase). We show that antephase cells exit the cell cycle and enter senescence at levels of DNA damage that induce a reversible arrest in early G 2. We show that checkpoint reversibility critically depends on the presence of the APC/C inhibitor Emi 1, which is degraded just before mitosis.

30|$|In the {{selection}} of top managers, {{the concept of a}} high-achieving young management team cannot be simply achieved by decreasing the average age; similarly, high performance will not be guaranteed by setting up an old management team in a listed company in the Chinese energy industry. The young top managers are usually characterized by vitality, rapid reaction, and strong learning ability, and this is why young management teams prevail in China. However, a young management team should be the result of a comprehensive consideration of individual competences. The competent young top manager (40 – 45  years old according to research results) can be acquired by creating an integrated cultivation system that includes talent mining, selection, reserves, training, and appointments. Specifically, according to research results, top manager candidates should be identified before the age of 35. The cultivation program, including training, learning opportunities, and rotations then needs to begin to build the capacity of candidates. Similarly, high company performance is not the inevitable result of an older top manager. Although the older top managers have rich management experience, their cognitive ability and adaptive capacity are relatively weak. Therefore, listed companies are expected to establish a win–win <b>withdrawal</b> <b>mechanism</b> in order to remove the older top managers’ concerns on their interests and to create the necessary development space for young top managers.

Instead, the elongated part is tightly enveloped by a membrane. Because of the close fit between the elongated part and its surrounding membrane, eversion of the membrane allows for insertion of the elongated part, and retraction of the membrane induces withdrawal of the elongated part. This surrounding membrane makes it possible to store the median ejaculatory guide (MEG) in a small genital cavity, with the basal portion of the elongated part extending internally against the entrance. This unusual character state is observed only in members of the subgenus Lema, which also have the elongated part.

Here, we report that the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a bile acid sensor, activates gluconeogenic pathways in the liver and regulates GR expression and activity. FXR-null mice are hypoglycemic in the unfed state and exhibit both a reduced hepatic production of glucose {{in response to the}} pyruvate challenge and a decreased expression of two rate-limiting enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and glucose- 6 -phosphatase (G 6 Pase), along with blunted liver expression of GR. Treating wild-type mice with a semisynthetic FXR ligand (6 E-CDCA) increases the liver expression of GR, PEPCK, and G 6 Pase. This effect was lost in fed animals, as well as in FXR-/- mice. The human and mouse GR promoters contain a conserved FXR-responsive element (an ER- 8 sequence) whose activation by FXR ligation leads to GR transcription. GR silencing by siRNA in vitro or its pharmacological antagonism in vivo with mifepristone reverses the effect of FXR activation on expression of gluconeogenic genes.

Concerns about future water supplies are particularly pronounced on Peru’s arid Pacific slope, where upstream glacier recession {{has been accompanied by}} rapid and water-intensive economic development.
