5000|$|The Rangers were {{dissatisfied}} with the results shown by one of their top pitching prospects, so in 2007 they tried an unconventional tactic. Vólquez was demoted to the Bakersfield Blaze of the Class A-Advanced California League, {{to work on his}} control. As Vólquez progressed, he was slowly promoted up through the minor league system until he reached the big leagues in September. This tactic had been used by Mark Connor, the Rangers' pitching coach, once before. Vólquez showed much improvement in his big league performance that season, posting a 2-1 record and 4.50 ERA in six starts.

Another big shock when they found that it didn't work and that we all communicated about wants or needs of any given child. After this was established, we sort of fell into our patterns of school, practices, just normal life in general. The kids all started realizing that there were three of us to care for them when they were sick, three of us to get scolded from, hugs from, tickles from; three of us to feed the small army of mouths and three of us to trust completely in.

5000|$|In 1987, Carson was {{the lead}} {{neurosurgeon}} of a 70-member surgical team that separated conjoined twins, Patrick and Benjamin Binder, who had been joined {{at the back of}} the head (craniopagus twins); the separation surgery held promise in part because the twin boys had separate brains. Both boys entered the hospital [...] "giggling and kicking" [...] in preparation for surgery without which the seven-month-old twins would never have been able to crawl, walk, or even turn over. The Johns Hopkins surgical team rehearsed the surgery for weeks, practising on two dolls secured together by Velcro. Although follow-up stories were few following the Binder twins' return to Germany seven months after the operation, both twins were reportedly [...] "far from normal" [...] two years after the procedure, with one in a vegetative state. [...] "I will never get over this [...] [...] [...] <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> them separated?" [...] said their mother, Theresia Binder, in a 1993 interview. Neither twin was ever able to talk or care for himself, and both would eventually become institutionalized wards of the state. Patrick Binder died sometime during the last decade, according to his uncle, who was located by the Washington Post in 2015. The Binder surgery served as blueprint for similar twin separations, a procedure that was refined in subsequent decades. Carson participated in four subsequent high-risk conjoined twin separations, including a 1997 operation on craniopagus Zambian twins, Joseph and Luka Banda, which resulted in a normal neurological outcome. Two sets of twins died, including Iranian twins Ladan and Laleh Bijani; another separation resulted in the death of one twin and the survival of another, who is legally blind and struggles to walk.|$|R
