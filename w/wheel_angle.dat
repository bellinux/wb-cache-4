30|$|Also {{criterion}} C 3, regarding {{preservation of}} individual behaviour {{appears to be}} valid. Using paired sample correlation, itwas shown that test subjects keep their steering characteristics very well (r values close to 1) regarding maximum steering <b>wheel</b> <b>angles</b> and steering <b>wheel</b> rates. They do not, however, preserve their characteristics regarding SWRRs. Arguably, thecriterion can still {{be considered to be}} valid, since SWRRs are less important compared to maximum steering <b>wheel</b> <b>angles</b> and steering <b>wheel</b> rates when considering the outcome of the steering behaviour, i.e. avoiding the collision. It should alsobe pointed out that there were, as stated for the previous criterion, no significant differences in SWRRs between testsettings on the population level.|$|R
25|$|The {{brain of}} the ESC {{system is the}} {{electronic}} control unit (ECU). The various control techniques are embedded in it. Often, the same ECU is used for diverse systems {{at the same time}} (ABS, Traction control system, climate control, etc.). The input signals are sent through the input-circuit to the digital controller. The desired vehicle state is determined based upon the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>angle,</b> its gradient and the wheel speed. Simultaneously, the yaw sensor measures the actual state. The controller computes the needed brake or acceleration force for each wheel and directs via the driver circuits the valves of the hydraulic modulator. Via a Controller Area Network interface the ECU is connected with other systems (ABS, etc.) in order to avoid giving contradictory commands.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{electronic}} stability {{control systems}} are an {{evolution of the}} ABS concept. Here, {{a minimum of two}} additional sensors are added to help the system work: these are a steering <b>wheel</b> <b>angle</b> sensor, and a gyroscopic sensor. The theory of operation is simple: when the gyroscopic sensor detects that the direction taken by the car does not coincide with what the steering wheel sensor reports, the ESC software will brake the necessary individual wheel(s) (up to three with the most sophisticated systems), so that the vehicle goes the way the driver intends. The steering wheel sensor also helps in the operation of Cornering Brake Control (CBC), since this will tell the ABS that wheels {{on the inside of the}} curve should brake more than wheels on the outside, and by how much.|$|E

Circuit board layouts and CAD files for 3 D printing are also provided online. The paper is mainly aimed at research institutions needing to collect this data in proving ground scenarios at a limited budged without requiring access to manufacturer's IP. The measurement uncertainty of steering <b>wheel</b> <b>angles</b> is shown to be in the order of 2 ° {{at a rate of about}} 5 Hz, but can be improved in individual applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Rovers {{that are}} used to explore craters on the Moon or Mars require the {{mobility}} to negotiate sandy slopes, on which slippage can easily occur. Such slippage can be reduced by actively readjusting the attitude of the rovers. By changing attitude, rovers can modify the position of their center of gravity and the wheel-soil contact angle. In this study, we discuss the effects of attitude changes on downhill sideslip based on the slope failure mechanism and experiments on reconfiguring the rover attitude and <b>wheel</b> <b>angles.</b> We conducted slope-traversing experiments using a wheeled rover under various roll <b>angles</b> and <b>wheel</b> <b>angles.</b> The experimental results show that the contact <b>angle</b> between <b>wheels</b> and slopes has a dominant influence on sideslip when compared with that of readjusting the rover’s center of gravity.

50|$|If a {{ball joint}} fails, {{the results can}} be {{dangerous}} as the <b>wheel's</b> <b>angle</b> becomes unconstrained, causing loss of control. Because the tire will be at an unintended angle, the vehicle will come to an abrupt halt, damaging the tires. Also, during failure, debris can damage other parts of the vehicle.|$|R
30|$|It {{was also}} found that test {{subjects}} keep their steering characteristics between test settings. Very high correlation values (r close to 1) were obtained from paired sample correlation tests of maximum steering <b>wheel</b> <b>angles</b> and maximum steeringwheel rates. Furthermore, no large effects of learning (measured using Pearson’s correlation coefficient) were found in thecollision avoidance manoeuvre.|$|R

5000|$|Mercedes's Attention Assist {{monitors}} a driver's behaviour for {{the first}} 20 minutes behind the wheel to get a baseline of behaviours.

30|$|The Smart Eye Pro 6.0 three-camera eye {{tracking}} system {{was used to}} capture the participant’s eye movements, which was mounted on the front windscreen to accurately capture the driver’s eye movements (fixations and saccades) at a frequency of 60  Hz.

50|$|Mecanum wheels - The {{previously}} mentioned RFL super-heavyweight competitor Alcoholic Stepfather uses Mecanum wheels and specialized motor control systems that allow it controlled motion {{in any direction}} without turning.

5000|$|The {{paddle wheel}} is usually {{mechanically}} coupled to a potentiometer, {{so as to}} generate an output voltage level varying with the <b>wheel's</b> <b>angle</b> relative to a fixed reference position. A paddle is thus an absolute position controller. That is, without any previous knowledge, the sensor can be read and the result directly indicates {{the position of the}} paddle knob. This is in contrast to a rotary encoder-based device or [...] "spinner".|$|R
50|$|The car {{also uses}} Volvo's Intelligent Driver Information System (IDIS) which {{continuously}} monitors the car's preemptive {{systems such as}} steering <b>wheel</b> <b>angle,</b> pedal depressions, and overall factors that help the vehicle's computer to decide if the driver is busy or distracted merging or turning, and will then accordingly delay certain data or alerts that are unimportant.|$|E
5000|$|EBD {{may work}} in {{conjunction}} with ABS and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) to minimize yaw accelerations during turns. ESC compares the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>angle</b> to vehicle turning rate using a yaw rate sensor. [...] "Yaw" [...] is the vehicle's rotation around its vertical center of gravity (turning left or right). If the yaw sensor detects more/less yaw than the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>angle</b> should create, the car is understeering or oversteering and ESC activates one of the front or rear brakes to rotate the car back onto its intended course. For example, if a car is making a left turn and begins to understeer (the car plows forward {{to the outside of}} the turn) ESC activates the left rear brake, which will help turn the car left. The sensors are so sensitive, and the actuation is so quick that the system may correct direction before the driver reacts. ABS helps prevent wheel lock-up and EBD helps apply appropriate brake force to make ESC work effectively and easily.|$|E
50|$|Standard {{terminology}} {{used to describe}} understeer and oversteer are defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in document J670 and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in document 8855. By these terms, understeer and oversteer are based on differences in steady-state conditions where the vehicle is following a constant-radius path at a constant speed with a constant steering <b>wheel</b> <b>angle,</b> on a flat and level surface.|$|E
50|$|Active Steering System realizes {{handling}} {{with more}} linear response by adaptively controlling front <b>wheel</b> turn <b>angle</b> according to steering input and vehicle speed. At slower vehicle speeds the system improves response by shifting to a quicker steering gear ratio, while at higher speeds it substantially improves stability by {{moving to a}} slower gear ratio. For rapid steering inputs, S-AWC momentarily increases front <b>wheel</b> turn <b>angle</b> and Super AYC control to realize sharper response. In countersteer situations, S-AWC increases responsiveness further to assist the driver with steering precision.|$|R

40|$|Wheel alignment, {{consisting}} of properly checking the <b>wheel</b> characteristic <b>angles</b> against vehicle manufacturersʹ specifications, {{is a crucial}} task in the automotive field since it prevents irregular tyre wear and affects vehicle handling and safety. In recent years, systems based on Machine Vision have been widely studied in order to automatically detect wheels’ characteristic angles. In order to overcome the limitations of existing methodologies, due to measurement equipment being mounted onto the wheels, the present work deals with design and assessment of a 3 D machine vision‐based system for the contactless reconstruction of vehicle wheel geometry, with particular reference to characteristic planes. Such planes, properly {{referred to as a}} global coordinate system, are used for determining <b>wheel</b> <b>angles.</b> The effectiveness of the proposed method was tested against a set of measurements carried out using a commercial 3 D scanner; the absolute average error in measuring toe and camber angles with the machine vision system resulted in full compatibility with the expected accuracy of wheel alignment systems...|$|R
50|$|The Sports ABS system {{supports}} braking when entering {{into a corner}} by controlling power to all tires depending on handling characteristics. Braking can be controlled to obtain optimal damping at each tire based on information from four wheel-speed sensors and steering <b>wheel</b> <b>angle</b> sensor. The addition of yaw rate sensors and brake pressure sensors to the Sport ABS system has improved braking performance through corners compared to the Lancer Evolution IX.|$|E
50|$|The graphs to {{the right}} show the {{simulated}} effect of lifting off the throttle {{in the middle of}} a left turn. The transients in the first couple of seconds are due to the test, in which a step steer input (<b>wheel</b> <b>angle)</b> is applied at 0 s and held constant throughout. The steady state cornering is at constant speed, with a lateral acceleration of 0.45 g approximately until the throttle is released at 6 s.|$|E
50|$|Optical {{guidance}} {{relies on}} the principles of image processing. A camera {{in the front of the}} vehicle scans the bands of paint on the ground representing the reference path. The signals obtained by the camera are sent to an onboard computer, which combines them with dynamic parameters of the vehicle (speed, yaw rate, <b>wheel</b> <b>angle).</b> The calculator transmits commands to the guidance motor located on the steering column of the vehicle to control its path in line with that of the reference.|$|E

Just like most times, the first {{attacker}} {{is not the}} winning rider, as the group was able to catch and pass him. Grivko never managed to return and finished fifth. In the final five kilometres, Voigt and Pereiro broke away from Chavanel and Quinziato, who were both expecting the other to close the gap. Neither of them did, {{and the other two}} maintained their lead the rest of the way. In the final hundred meters, Pereiro was on Voigt's rear <b>wheel,</b> <b>angling</b> to pass him at the finish.
