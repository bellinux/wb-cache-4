A recent rigorous analysis has shown, on the contrary, that this process {{is driven by the}} balance of vorticity generated by a curved flame front with the baroclinic vorticity, and predicted existence of a regime in which {{the leading edge of the}} flame front is concave. We report first experimental realization of this regime. Our experiments on ethane and n-butane mixtures with air show that flames with an inflection point on the front are regularly produced in lean mixtures, provided that a sufficiently <b>weak</b> <b>ignition</b> is used.

40|$|Deflagration-to-detonation {{transition}} {{can occur}} in industrial explosions involving highly reactive gas mixtures such as H_ 2 /air. Large degrees of confinement and congestion support strong flame acceleration and the transition to detonation. Various mechanisms can accomplish the onset of detonation, such as mixing processes and instabilities or shock-induced ignition. This paper focuses on ignition by normal shock reflection. Two ignition modes behind reflected shock waves are distinguished: strong ignition, which enables direct detonation initiation; and <b>weak</b> <b>ignition,</b> leading to distributed ignition kernels (deflagrations). Models for the prediction of ignition modes by Voevodsky and Soloukhin, Meyer and Oppenheim, Radulescu et al., Grogan and Ihme, and Thomas et al., are evaluated and compared using a state-of-the-art detailed chemical kinetic scheme. Based on these models, critical incident shock Mach numbers leading to strong ignition are determined. Similarities and deviations between these models are discussed and strategies for future experimental work are proposed...|$|E

The balance of the report is devoted to juxtaposition of reassuring and disquieting facts, presentation of a set of recommendations that ignition of hydrogen-air mixtures by <b>weak</b> <b>ignition</b> sources in unconfined geometries may produce a detonation, provided the effective flame area in the initial fireball is rapidly increased by turbulent mixing.

40|$|Analytical work is {{presented}} for the spontaneous ignition of a hydrogen jet emanating from a slot into air. A similarity {{solution of the}} flowfield was obtained. This was combined with the species and energy conservation equations, which were solved using activation energy asymptotics. Limits of spontaneous ignition were identified as functions of slot width, flow rate, and temperatures of the hydrogen jet and ambient air. Two scenarios are examined: a cool jet flowing into a hot ambient and a hot jet flowing into a cool ambient. For both scenarios, ignition is favored with an increase of either the ambient temperature or the hydrogen supply temperature. Moreover, for the hot ambient scenario, a decrease in local fuel Lewis number also promotes ignition. The Lewis number of the oxidizer only has a <b>weak</b> effect on <b>ignition.</b> Because spontaneous ignition is very sensitive to temperature, ignition is predicted to occur {{near the edge of}} the jet if the hydrogen is cooler than the air and on the centerline if the hydrogen is hotter than the air...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{simulations}} of the bifurcation and ignition of an Argon-diluted Hydrogen/Oxy-gen mixture in the two-stage <b>weak</b> <b>ignition</b> regime are performed. An adaptive mesh-refinement (AMR) technique is employed to resolve all relevant physical scales {{that are associated}} with the viscous boundary-layer, the reaction front, and the shock-wave. A high-order hybrid WENO/central-differencing method is used as spatial discretization scheme, and a detailed chemical mechanism is employed to describe the combustion of the H 2 /O 2 mixture. The operating conditions considered in this study are p 5 = 5 bar and T 5 = 1100 K, and fall in the third explosion limit. The computations show that the mixing of the thermally stratified fluid, carrying different momentum and enthalpy, introduces inhomogeneities in the core-region behind the reflected shock. These inhomogeneities act as localized ignition kernels. During the induction period, these kernels slowly expand and eventually transition to a detonation wave that rapidly consumes the unburned mixture. In competition with this detonation wave are the presence of secondary ignition kernels that appear in the unreacted core-region between reflected shock and detonation wave. I...|$|E

Their main effects are {{the release of}} large amounts of carbon to the atmosphere with loses of organic soil and its biota. Quantitative data on the behaviour of smouldering wildfires are very scarce and are needed to understand its ecological effects, to validate fuel consumption and smouldering propagation models and to develop danger-rating systems. We present, for the first time, a methodology for conducting smouldering experiments in field conditions. This method provides key data to investigate smouldering combustion dynamics, acquire fire behaviour metrics and obtain indicators for ecological effects of smouldering fires. It {{is to be applied}} in all types of undisturbed soils. The experimental protocol is based on a non-electric ignition source and the monitoring system relies on combining both point and surface specific temperature measurements.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{study was}} conducted to investigate the characteristics of auto-ignition in a syngas mixture at high-pressure and low-temperature conditions in the presence of thermal inhomogeneities. Highly resolved one-dimensional numerical simulations incorporating detailed chemistry and transport were performed. The temperature inhomogeneities were represented by a global sinusoidal temperature profile and a local Gaussian temperature spike (hot spot). Reaction front speed and front Damköhler number analyses were employed to characterise the propagating ignition front. In the presence of a global temperature gradient, the ignition behaviour shifted from spontaneous propagation (strong) to deflagrative (weak), as the initial mean temperature of the reactant mixture was lowered. A predictive Zel'dovich–Sankaran criterion to determine the transition from strong to <b>weak</b> <b>ignition</b> was validated for different parametric sets. At sufficiently low temperatures, the strong ignition regime was recovered due to faster passive scalar dissipation of the imposed thermal fluctuations relative to the reaction timescale, which was quantified by the mixing Damköhler number. In the presence of local hot spots, only deflagrative fronts were observed. However, the fraction of the reactant mixture consumed by the propagating front was found to increase as the initial mean temperature was lowered, thereby leading to more enhanced compression-heating of the end-gas. Passive scalar mixing was not found to be important for the hot spot cases considered. The parametric study confirmed that the relative magnitude of the Sankaran number translates accurately to the quantitative strength of the deflagration front in the overall ignition advancement. © 2015 Taylor & Franci...|$|E
40|$|Low-temperature {{ignition}} {{characteristics of}} dimethyl ether (DME) /air mixture were studied in an external heated, straight-shaped, plug-flow reactor under atmospheric pressure. Auto-ignition of the mixture was attained under a specific {{narrow range of}} temperature and equivalence ratio with relatively longer exposure time. Three kinds of ignition behaviors were identified accordingly as the equivalence ratio increased, such as (1) periodic hot flames, followed by (2) periodic two-stage <b>ignitions</b> (<b>weak</b> flame(s) and subsequent hot flame), lastly (3) chaotic weak flames. Time-sequential gas analyses were conducted for the case showing a typical periodic two-stage ignition in order to investigate the mechanism of the observed low-temperature auto-ignition under 500 K. The results revealed that the formation of CH 4 and C 2 H 2 was promoted prior to the hot flame ignition, suggesting that the chain-branching reaction pathway might exist. The transition from weak flame to hot flame was clearly observed as the mixture equivalence ratio decreased, implying the oxygen could be responsible to trigger this transition. It is suspected that the chain-branching precursor CH 2 OCH 2 OOH radicals should be relatively stable in the examined temperature range here, thus can gradually accumulate through a longer exposure time, and eventually give rise to the chain-branching explosion.

40|$|To achieve {{cleaner and}} more {{efficient}} energy utilization, novel strategies in modern combustion devices operate using lean, premixed reactant mixtures at high pressures. Under these conditions, auto-ignition often becomes a dominant process for burning. Therefore, accurate prediction of auto-ignition characteristics {{is of paramount importance}} in successful implementation of these advanced combustion systems. The first part of this dissertation focuses on auto-ignition characteristics at high-pressure, low-temperature conditions, relevant to modern gas turbine engines. In particular, strong (homogeneous) and <b>weak</b> (deflagration-dominant) <b>ignition</b> regimes in the presence of thermal inhomogeneities are computationally investigated. Predictive criteria based on Zel’dovich’s theory and passive scalar mixing, which can capture the ignition behavior a priori, are proposed and validated using extensive parametric tests of one-dimensional laminar systems of a lean syngas/air mixture. Subsequently, a non-dimensional scaling analysis is performed to derive regime criteria for turbulent reacting flows, leading to a turbulent ignition regime diagram. The regime diagram is then numerically validated against two-dimensional direct numerical simulations of syngas/air auto-ignition. A number of parametric test cases, by varying the turbulent Damköhler and Reynolds numbers, are considered. The auto-ignition phenomena are characterized by analyzing the corresponding heat release rates and resultant combustion modes. It is demonstrated that the observed ignition behaviors are consistent with the regime diagram predictions. In {{the second part of the}} dissertation, applicability of a Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes based spray-interactive flamelet (SIF) combustion model to stratified LTC in direct-injection compression ignition (DICI) engines is assessed, which incorporates the interaction between spray evaporation, gas-phase combustion and turbulent mixing. A number of parametric cases are considered by way of varying the fuel start-of-injection (SOI) timing. The numerical results are validated against available experimental data for in-cylinder pressure trace and CO/NO emissions. It is shown that the SIF model performs well over a wide range of stratified conditions due to the incorporation of the effects of small-scale turbulent transport on combustion. Finally, the SIF model is employed to further investigate the impact of fuel injection parameters such as injection pressure and spray cone angle on the NO-CO trade-off of the DICI engine for the most delayed SOI timing...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} a programme {{of research to}} determine ignition energy requirements in flowing kerosene spray air mixtures under various flow conditions such as velocity, mixture strength, spray mean drop size and drop distribution. In {{order to determine the}} spray characteristics of mixture ratio, mean drop size and drop distribution in the flowing fuel-air spray accurately, new designs have been evolved and employed. A single rectangular pulse of constant power was employed for initiating ignition in the mixture. The flow parameters were found to have considerable influence on spark characteristics and hence on the energy released in the spark. The breakdown voltage requirements of the spark in the two phase flow differed from they of premixed gaseous mixtures. In the range of weak mixtures investigated, optimum spark duration was found to vary depending on spray drop size between 30 and 60 microseconds. Minimum ignition energy increased with increase in velocity, but decreased with reduction in drop diameter and with increase in equivalence ratio. Low flow number atomisers giving small drop sizes extended the <b>weak</b> <b>ignition</b> limits for a given spark energy. Spray drop size and distribution were found to have a singularly large influence on all aspects of ignition.

40|$|Dust explosions {{propagating}} into tubes may accelerate {{and show}} {{transition to a}} stable detonation regime. The conditions allowing the existence of detonations in a certain mixture and the detonation parameters can not be derived {{from the results of}} the standard explosion test procedures. It is the aim of this work to continue previous experiments and to extend the knowledge in the field of dust detonation, especially to investigate dust-air-mixtures at an initial pressure of 0. 1 MPa. For that a new dust detonation tube was constructed, with an inner diameter of 300 mm and a length of 40 m. This tube is equipped with a dispersion system, which is able to generate a uniform dust-gas-mixture of known concentration in the whole test section. Different ignition methods and energies were applied to initiate the process. The investigations refer to the detonation velocity and pressure, the acceleration and transition to detonation, the cell structure, and the dynamic mechanical reaction of the tube. For cornstarch-air-mixtures the existence of stable detonations was demonstrated depending on the concentration. Even with <b>weak</b> <b>ignition</b> sources transition to detonation was achieved within the test section. More reactive mixtures with higher K_S_t-values show significantly shorter transition distances.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{directed}} at the pyrotechnic time delay compositions {{that are used in}} detonator assemblies. The objectives were to: [...] Investigate effective alternatives for the barium and lead-based oxidants currently used, maintaining the use of silicon as fuel [...] Develop easy to use, realistic measurement techniques for burn rates and shock tube ignitability [...] Determine the variables that affect burn rate, and [...] Evaluate alternative processing routes to facilitate intimate mixing of the component powders. Lead chromate and copper antimonite were found to be suitable oxidants for silicon in time delay compositions. They were ignitable by shock tubing, a relatively <b>weak</b> <b>ignition</b> source. The measured burn speeds for these systems showed a bimodal dependence on stoichiometry. Measured burn rates varied between 6 - 28 mm/s. Lead chromate is potentially a suitable alternative to the oxidant currently used in the medium burn rate commercial composition. It burns faster than copper antimonite. The latter is potentially a suitable replacement oxidant for the slow and medium compositions. Antimony trioxide-based compositions exhibited unreliable performance with respect to ignition with shock tubing. The addition of aluminium powder or fumed silica was found to reduce the burn rate. Increasing the silicon particle size (m m) also decreased the burn speed for copper antimonite and lead chromate compositions. Addition of fumed silica improved the flow properties of the lead chromate, copper antimonite and antimony trioxide powders allowing for easier mixing. The silicon powder was found to react violently with water in alkaline solutions. This makes particle dispersion in a wet-mixing process problematic.

40|$|Gas {{explosions in}} closed pipes {{with a single}} {{obstacle}} have been investigated both numerically and experimentally. Most {{of the work is}} related to hydrogen and air mixtures, but other fuels have also been used. At the present time there does not exist a software tool or a numerical method that single-handedly can cover the whole range of phenomena in gas explosions. Computational fluid dynamics is also a developing field, even for fluid flow without chemical reactions. The objective of this work was to develop numerical models that can be applied in predictive simulations of gas explosions in pipes and tunnels. Such predictive tools are important since they can expand the knowledge of gas explosions and thereby reduce the risk and consequences of gas explosion accidents. The experiments were performed with premixed fuel and air at atmospheric conditions in three closed steel pipes. The pipes had an inner diameter of 107 mm and inner lengths of 3. 0, 4. 0 and 7. 0 m. The various gas mixtures were ignited at the center of one end wall by a <b>weak</b> <b>ignition</b> source. Both the 4. 0 and the 7. 0 m pipe had an obstacle installed inside the pipe 1. 0 m from the ignition wall. Four different fuels and seven different obstacles were used in the experiments. The obstacles had opening diameters ranging from 5 to 80 mm and the fuels were hydrogen, propane, methane and blends of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Two types of Kistler pressure transducers were distributed along the pipes to measure the experimental overpressure. The experimental work has provided a unique data set which includes combustion regimes ranging from laminar flames to detonations. Several conditions which affect the flame propagation and transition to detonation in single obstructed pipes have been found. The numerical work has been related to the one dimensional code RCMLAB. New numerical models have been developed and applied in the numerical simulations with this code. (The primary focus of these simulations were the flame propagation between the ignition wall and the obstacle.) The numerical simulations showed a high level of similarity between the measured experimental overpressure and the simulated overpressure at the various pressure transducer positions in the pipe. RCMLAB can therefore be used to enhance the understanding of gas explosions in pipes. Important parameters in the combustion process, such as the average burning rate, can be quantified by this numerical code. The numerical work performed in this thesis have also brought RCMLAB closer to becoming a predictive numerical code for simulation of gas explosions in pipes and tunnels. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development and validation of a methodology for estimating the consequences of accidental dust explosions in complex geometries. The approach adopted entails the use of results from standardized tests in 20 -litre explosion vessels as input to the combustion model in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, and the subsequent validation of the model system by comparing with results from laboratory and large-scale experiments. The PhD project includes dedicated laboratory experiments designed to explore selected aspects of flame propagation in dust clouds, and to reveal {{similarities and differences between}} flame propagation in gaseous mixtures and mechanical suspensions of combustible powder in air. The research project represents a continuation of numerous efforts by various research groups, where the key underlying problem has been the scaling of results obtained in laboratory tests for predicting the consequences of dust explosion scenarios in industry. The traditional approach to the scaling problem entails the use of empirical correlations, typically represented as nomographs or formulas in relevant safety standards. It is generally accepted that empirical correlations may work reasonably well for simple geometries, such as isolated process vessels and silos. The need for more sophisticated methods arises for accident scenarios that involve complex geometrical boundary conditions, such as flame propagation in connected vessel systems and secondary dust explosions inside buildings. The European Commission (EC) supported the Dust Explosion Simulation Code (DESC) project under the Fifth Framework Programme. The goal was to develop and validate a CFD code for simulating industrial dust explosions in complex geometries. To this end, GexCon created the CFD code DESC (Dust Explosion Simulation Code) by modifying the existing CFD code FLACS (FLame ACceleration Simulator), originally developed for simulating gas explosions in congested offshore geometries. The specific contributions from the candidate with respect {{to the development of the}} CFD software is limited to the methodology for estimating combustion parameters for a given dust sample from experimental results, the validation of the resulting model system against experimental data, and general participation in the R&D team during the development process. The modelling of particle-laden flow and heterogeneous combustion in the CFD code DESC involves several simplifying assumptions. The flow model assumes thermal and kinetic equilibrium between the dispersed particles and the continuous phase, and the k-ε turbulence model in FLACS remains unchanged for multiphase flows. The empirical correlation for the turbulent burning velocity in dust clouds originates from experiments with premixed combustion in gaseous mixtures. The fraction of dust that takes part in the combustion reactions, as function of the nominal dust concentration, is estimated from the explosion pressures measured in a constant volume explosion vessel. The thermodynamic data available in FLACS limit the application area to materials containing the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur. The simplifications limit the application area of DESC to certain classes of materials, and flame propagation in dust clouds with relatively high reactivity. DESC do not contain models for simulating phenomena such as agglomeration, gravitational settling, and selective separation of particles in flow through cyclones or along other curved paths. In spite of the simplicity of the model system, the results from the validation work show that the CFD code DESC can describe the course of dust explosions in relatively complex geometries with reasonable accuracy relative to the inherent spread in the experimental results. The results obtained for silo explosions reproduce trends observed for variation in vent area and ignition position from various experiments. Results obtained for flame propagation sustained by dust dispersion from a layer indicate that the empirical model for dust lifting in DESC is suitable for the purpose. Results obtained for dust explosions vented through ducts reproduce the experimental trends fairly well. Simulations of dust explosions in a system of two vented vessels connected by a pipe with a 90 ° bend indicate that the DESC can reproduce relatively complex chains of events, including dust lifting from a layer. The results for the connected vessel system also demonstrate how sensitive the results can be with respect to modest changes in the initial and boundary conditions. Finally, simulations of explosion experiments in elongated vessels with repeated obstacles reproduce the experimental trends fairly well. Although the results from the validation work indicate that CFD simulations can become a valuable tool for consequence modelling and design of industrial facilities, the modelling in DESC requires further improvements. An essential improvement entails fundamental changes to the numerical solver to reduce in the influence of the grid resolution on the results from the simulations. In the current versions of FLACS and DESC, simulation of explosion scenarios is subject to strict grid guidelines. The current versions of both codes use a structured Cartesian grid, with limited possibilities for local grid refinement. This poses a particular challenge for DESC, since the grid resolution required to resolve complex internal geometries on a structured Cartesian grid varies significantly from case to case. The long-term solution to these challenges will presumably entail the use of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), and this is outside the scope of the present work. The model system may also benefit from various other improvements, such as turbulent burning velocity correlations specifically developed for dust explosions, an explicit model for turbulent flame thickness, radiation models, local grid refinement in the region where ignition occurs, reduced dependence on empirical input to the model system, and in general more realistic modelling of particleladen flow and heterogeneous combustion. There is, however, a fine balance between the level of detailed information that must be specified in the model, and the applicability and user-friendliness of the model system. For most industrial applications of a CFD tool for dust explosions, there are significant inherent uncertainties associated with initial and boundary conditions. Dust explosion experiments in transparent balloons show that the initial phase of flame propagation in turbulent dust clouds can progress in a distributed manner, with very limited energy output. This observation may explain some of the challenges associated with the analysis of pressure-time histories from 20 -litre explosion vessels for dust explosions when using a <b>weak</b> <b>ignition</b> source. Experiments in a 3. 6 -m flame acceleration tube demonstrate the importance of explosion-generated turbulence for dust explosions, and illustrate the challenge associated with poor repeatability in dust explosion experiments. The results obtained for propane-air mixtures in the same apparatus indicate that FLACS under-predicts the rate of combustion for turbulent flame propagation in fuel-rich propane-air mixtures. The CFD code DESC represents a significant step forward for process safety related to dust explosions in the process industry. There is, however, significant room for further improvements to the model system, and dedicated experiments will play an important role for the future development of the code. Improved safety in the process industry requires reliable and well-documented consequence models, and future development of DESC should include an integrated framework for model validation, including verification and testing. </p...|$|E
