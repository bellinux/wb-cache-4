The results show that for higher recording densities subject to increased ISI and noise, the use of more complex precompensation schemes does not significantly improve the system performance.

40|$|In a {{high-density}} {{magnetic recording}} channel, nonlinear distortions, known as transition shift and partial erasure, arise and often limit {{the performance of}} the detector. In this study, the effect of partial erasure is emphasized and the transition shift is assumed to be eliminated by the <b>write</b> current <b>precompensation</b> technique. The presence of the partial erasure effect complicates the evaluation of the statistics for the storage data, and few researchers have explicitly studied on this problem. However, the statistical properties are of importance especially for designing a detector. We have derived a closed-form expression of the statistics for the storage data and apply the results to design a minimum mean square error (MMSE) linear equalizer. The resulting partial equalizer is often accompanied with a maximum likelihood sequence detector to achieve the acceptable performance in a reasonable realization complexity. The performance of the proposed method is improved as compared with the conventional ones because the nonlinear effect has been taken into consideration. The result is suitable for all classes of the commonly used partial responses and can be extended to design a decision feedback equalizer (DFE). Extensive computer simulations will be given to verify the results and be compared with the conventional ones.

40|$|As {{magnetic}} recording density increases, the nonlinear effects, known as transition shift and partial erasure, arise and complicate {{the design of}} the detector. Although the transition shift could be eliminated by the <b>write</b> current <b>precompensation</b> technique, the partial erasure effect still degrades the performance of the detector. Conventionally, the generalized partial response maximum likelihood sequence detector (GPRMLSD) is often applied for data detection; it adopts a linear target response, optimizes the coefficients of the target response and partial equalizer, and then compensates the partial erasure and intersymbol interference (ISI) by the corresponding Viterbi detector (VD). In this study, we extend the target response to a nonlinear function matched to the channel, jointly optimize the coefficients of the nonlinear target response and the partial equalizer via the alternating coordinates minimization (ACM) algorithm, and implement the corresponding Viterbi detector. The cost function is defined as the sum of the squared errors between the outputs of the target response and the partial equalizer. Furthermore, two “linear” expressions for the output of the target response are proposed such that the alternating coordinates minimization algorithm can iteratively solve the nonlinear cost function instead of directly solving the nonlinear equations. In addition, the alternating coordinates minimization algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a minimum. Finally, the state transition table and trellis diagram of the Viterbi decoder are derived; the proposed generalized nonlinear partial response maximum likelihood sequence detector (GNPRMLSD) will be realized.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} areal density in magnetic recording systems, perpendicular recording has replaced longitudinal recording {{to overcome the}} superparamagnetic limit. Studies on perpendicular recording channels including aspects of channel modeling, signal processing and coding techniques are presented in this dissertation. To optimize a high density perpendicular magnetic recording system, one needs to know the tradeoffs between various components of the system including the read/write transducers, the magnetic medium, and the read channel. We extend the work by Chaichanavong on the parameter optimization for systems via design curves. Different signal processing and coding techniques are studied. Information-theoretic tools are utilized to determine the acceptable region for the channel parameters when optimal detection and linear coding techniques are used. Our results show that a considerable gain {{can be achieved by}} the optimal detection and coding techniques.
