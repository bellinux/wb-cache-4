25|$|Commonly, {{heterosexual}} men reject {{the idea of}} being receptive partners during anal sex because they believe it is a feminine act, can make them vulnerable, or contradicts their sexual orientation (for example, that it is indicative that they are gay). The BMJ stated in 1999, however:There are little published data on how many {{heterosexual men}} would like their anus to be sexually stimulated in a heterosexual relationship. Anecdotally, it is a substantial number. What data <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> almost all relate to penetrative sexual acts, and the superficial contact of the anal ring with fingers or the tongue is even less well documented but may be assumed to be a common sexual activity for men of all sexual orientations.|$|E

500|$|Humble was {{expected}} {{to return to the}} Browns after his discharge from the military in 1952. In a surprise move, however, Brown traded him before the season to the Dallas Texans for fullback Sherman Howard.

[...] "I'm sure we'll be all right at the guard position," [...] Brown said at the time. [...] "But <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> a definite fullback problem." [...] Humble played one season for the Texans before retiring. Dallas had a 1–11 record in 1952.|$|E

He stated, [...] "One of my favourite songs to record, of all my recordings as a solo artist, is probably [...] "The Girl Is Mine", because working with Paul McCartney was pretty exciting and we just literally had fun. It was like lots of kibitzing and playing, and throwing stuff at each other, and making jokes. We actually recorded the (instrumental) track and the vocals pretty much live at the same time, and <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> footage of it, but it's never been shown." [...] He concluded, [...] "Maybe one day we'll give you a sneak preview of it." [...] The footage of the pair was later shown at The Paul McCartney World Tour.|$|E

[...] Writing in the book Crisis Management in the Food and Drinks Industry, Colin Doeg characterized Parliamentary Monitoring Services as a [...] "Comprehensive service covering the proceedings of Westminster and European Parliaments as well as US Congress". The organization is described in Public Relations in Practice as [...] "a political research, publishing, polling and campaigning company". James Macintyre and Nigel Morris of The Independent called Parliamentary Monitoring Services a [...] "well-known political lobbying firm".|$|E

500|$|However, not all reviews were as positive. Robert Abele of LA Weekly {{thought the}} pilot was average, {{containing}} [...] "fashionable gore, occasionally witty dialogue, serviceable suspense and boilerplate police-department politics". Abele felt that the series was a superhero tale, rather than the dark comedy, police thriller and brooding drama that it was promoted to be. Brian Lowry of Variety {{did not think that}} Dexter would impress critics, and noted, [...] "antics of the deranged... aren't really all that pleasant to watch", but praised Hall's acting saying that he [...] "... quickly dispatches any thoughts of his [...] "Six Feet" [...] character, which, by itself, represents quite an accomplishment." [...] Nancy DeWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal felt that the [...] "grotesqueries of Dexter are not something that can easily be dismissed with the old 'you don't have to watch' line. We don't have to watch. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> to live among the viewers who will be desensitized, or aroused, by this show".|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} build support early in the campaign, Hunter participated in local straw polls. On March 1, at the Spartanburg, South Carolina poll, Hunter {{finished}} a close third in a statistical tie with McCain and Giuliani. The showing impressed Spartanburg Republican Gerald Emory who referred to Hunter as, [...] "a true Ronald Reagan conservative that we can support." [...] The following month he won the Anderson County, South Carolina straw poll and tied for second place in both the Greenwood County and Pickens County straw polls. Hunter thanked the counties for their support, which he claimed provided [...] "a huge boost." [...] He added, [...] "t is clear our message of maintaining a strong national defense, securing our border without amnesty, holding China accountable on trade, and protecting life are resonating with the voters. Our campaign is one of issues, not flash and expense. We don't have a jet or an army of consultants and paid staff. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> the conservative message that is true. In the end, that will be what Americans want." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{a conference}} call with journalists, actor John Noble called [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] and the next two episodes of the third season an [...] "epic trilogy". He {{elaborated}} [...] "All year we've been heading toward the fact that {{there seems to be an}} inevitable conflict between the two universes. And we've gotten to know the people on both sides now, so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with '6:02.' By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading. And so everyone has to move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is not going to go away. It's now affecting our side. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem.' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy, leading up to the use of that machine." [...] In the same interview, Noble called the episode's title very critical to the series, stating [...] "That time frame plays through the three episodes. Very important to remember as we get to the finale, that time frame." ...|$|E

500|$|MLSE {{partnered with}} Rogers Communications in 2005 to bid {{to host a}} regular season National Football League game in Toronto. [...] On January 30, 2008 it was {{announced}} that Rogers and Larry Tanenbaum, chairman of MLSE, had reached an agreement with the Buffalo Bills to host an annual regular-season and three exhibition NFL games over five seasons at Toronto's Rogers Centre beginning in 2008, with the games branded the Bills Toronto Series. At the time MLSE was considering bringing a NFL team to Toronto permanently and building them a new stadium, but abandoned the idea when they concluded that the project would not generate sufficient financial return to justify the significant cost of the project. Subsequently, MLSE president Tim Leiweke said on a NFL team in Toronto: [...] "We can't own a team (per NFL rules), but <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> more expertise on how to build (stadiums) than anyone... MLSE can play a role." [...] It has been reported that MLSE is interested in building and managing the proposed NFL stadium, which it has already begun designing. [...] In 2013 MLSE minority owner Tanenbaum and board member Edward Rogers III partnered with musician Jon Bon Jovi to purchase an NFL team. [...] Following the death of Bills' owner Ralph Wilson in 2014 the group submitted an offer to purchase the franchise, with speculation that they would move the team to Toronto when their lease permitted it, but were outbid by the Pegulas.|$|E
500|$|Del Vecho {{explained}} how the film's animation team was organized: [...] "On this movie <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> character leads, supervising animators on specific characters. The animators themselves may work on multiple characters but it's always under one lead. I {{think it was}} different on Tangled, for example, but we chose {{to do it this}} way as we wanted one person to fully understand and develop their own character and then be able to impart that to the crew. Hyrum Osmond, the supervising animator on Olaf, is quiet but he has a funny, wacky personality so we knew he'd bring a lot of comedy to it; Anna's animator, Becky Bresee, it's her first time leading a character and we wanted her to lead Anna." [...] Acting coach Warner Loughlin was brought in to help the film's animators understand the characters they were creating. In order to get the general feeling of each scene, some animators did their own acting. [...] "I actually film myself acting the scene out, which I find very helpful," [...] said animation supervisor Rebecca Wilson Bresee. This helped her discover elements that made the scene feel real and believable. Elsa's supervising animator was Wayne Unten, who asked for that role because he was fascinated by the complexity of the character. Unten carefully developed Elsa's facial expressions in order to bring out her fear as contrasted against Anna's fearlessness. He also studied videos from Menzel's recording sessions and animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing. Head of Animation, Lino DiSalvo, said, [...] "The goal for the film was to animate the most believable CG characters you've ever seen." ...|$|E
500|$|The October 1970 Quebec FLQ Crisis put Lewis in the spotlight, {{as he was}} {{the only}} NDP MP with any roots in Quebec. He and Douglas were opposed to the October 16 {{implementation}} of the War Measures Act. The Act, enacted previously only for wartime purposes, imposed extreme limitations on civil liberties, and gave the police and military vastly expanded powers for arresting and detaining suspects, usually with little to no evidence required. Although it was only meant to be used in Quebec, since it was federal legislation, it was in-force throughout Canada. Some police services, from outside of Quebec, took advantage of it for their own purposes, which mostly had nothing even remotely related to the Quebec situation, as Lewis and Douglas suspected. Sixteen of the 20 members of the NDP parliamentary caucus voted against the implementation of the War Measures Act in the House of Commons. They took much grief for being the only parliamentarians to vote against it. [...] Lewis stated at a press scrum that day: [...] "The information <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have,</b> showed a situation of criminal acts and criminal conspiracy in Quebec. But, there is no information that there was unintended, or apprehended, or planned insurrection, which alone, would justify invoking the War Measures Act." [...] About five years later, many of the MPs who voted to implement it regretted doing so, and belatedly honoured Douglas and Lewis for their stand against it. [...] Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield {{went so far as to}} say that, [...] "Quite frankly, I've admired Tommy Douglas and David Lewis, and those fellows in the NDP for having the courage to vote against that, although they took a lot of abuse at the time....I don't brood about it. I'm not proud of it." ...|$|E
