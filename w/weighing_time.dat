The system consists of sensors, data processing module, control module and interface circuit. For restraining the influence of vehicle speed and vehicle liberation, the system adopts self-adaptive variable step size LMS algorithm based on neural network to filter out the noise of WIM signal. Based on this method of signal processing, a vehicle WIM system based on neural network self adaptive filtering was designed. The experimental results proved that the neural network based method can be used to reduce the <b>weighing</b> <b>time</b> and increase the accuracy simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate sources of errors in pig weight measurements. Three studies were conducted using data from one commercial New Zealand pig farm. In XChapter 4 X, finisher pigs fed ad libitum or via a computerized liquid feeding system were weighed four times a day over a fourday period. Results showed that standardization of <b>weighing</b> <b>time</b> reduced diurnal fluctuations in pig weight. However, multivariate analysis showed that there was a significant interaction between day and time of day, which indicates that diurnal fluctuations in live weight are not consistent between days, particularly in ad libitum fed pigs. Hence, XChapter 5 X investigated whether overnight feed withdrawal for 11 hours (weaners) or 17 hours (growers and finishers) is effective in reducing between-pig variation in live weight and growth rate. For grower and finisher pigs, feed withdrawal was associated with a reduction in variability in live weight and growth rate by up to 11. 5 %, whilst the effect was inconsistent in weaner pigs. It is recommended to repeat the investigation on other farms to assess long-term effects on pig performance before general recommendations can be made. XChapter 6 X compared the magnitude of sampling error when sampling pens from batches of pigs, using different sample sizes and sampling methods. Increasing the portion of randomly selected pens reduced the sampling error, but in a diminishing manner. Purposive selection of two pens reduced sampling error by more than 64 % compared with random sampling. However, purposive sampling introduces the risk of obtaining biased estimates. Thus, it is recommended to select pens from batches at random. These results may be used as an educational tool to demonstrate how to minimize errors in pig weights. Collecting more accurate weight records is likely to lead to improved interpretability of pig weights, and may promote better use of production data...|$|E
40|$|Swine Industry Day, 2014 {{is known}} as Swine Day, 2014 The {{accuracy}} and precision of pig subsampling methods can determine the swine producer’s ability to sell pigs at optimal market BW and reduce economic discounts. The first objective of this experiment {{was to determine the}} time required to weigh pigs for different sampling methods used to estimate the mean and SD of a population. The second objective was to define the optimal sampling method considering the time required to weigh pigs as well as the precision and accuracy of each sampling method. A total of 68 pens of pigs (359 × 1050, PIC, Hendersonville, TN; 169. 8 lb BW) in 2 commercial finishing facilities with 20 to 35 pigs per pen were used. Pens of pigs were blocked by location within barn and randomly allotted to 1 of 4 treatments with 17 pens per treatment. The 4 treatments included (1) selecting and weighing the heaviest and lightest pig per pen; and (2), (3), and (4) weighing the first 5, 10, and 15 pigs out of the pen, respectively. The time required for 2 people to complete each treatment was recorded. To determine the total barn time required to conduct a specific sample, the time required to weigh the specific number of pigs per pen was multiplied by n pens. The accuracy and precision for estimating the mean BW and SD for each sampling method was determined by using datasets A and C reported in Paulk (20144). The precision was determined by calculating a 95 % confidence interval (CI) for the sample means and SD. The time taken to select and weigh the heaviest and lightest pigs in a pen (Treatment 1) did not differ from weighing 5 pigs per pen (Treatment 2). Increasing the number of pigs weighed per pen (Treatments 3 and 4) increased (P < 0. 05) the amount of time to weigh a single pen. Based on these results, the number of pens for each treatment that can be weighed without influencing <b>weighing</b> <b>time</b> was determined to be 15 pens (30 pigs), 15 pens (75 pigs), 9 pens (90 pigs), and 6 pens (90 pigs) from Treatments 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. For dataset A, these 4 sampling methods had a similar CI range for estimating the mean BW and SD. For dataset C, Treatments 1 (30 pigs) and 2 (75 pigs) had a reduced CI range for estimating the mean BW compared with Treatments 3 (90 pigs) and 4 (90 pigs); however, Treatments 2 (75 pigs) and 3 (90 pigs) had a reduced CI range for estimating the SD compared with Treatments 1 (30 pigs) and 4 (90 pigs). Therefore, we conclude that swine producers should weigh 5 pigs from 15 pens to estimate the mean BW and SD within a barn...|$|E

40|$|Objetivou-se avaliar o efeito do diâmetro do caule na desidratação, composição química e disponibilidade de feno da Jurema preta (Mimosa tenuiflora). As plantas estavam com média de 3 metros de altura e em final de floração. Foram selecionados caules representativos nos diâmetros 5, 6, 7, 8 e 9 mm, os quais foram cortados, separados em caule e folhas e submetidos ao processo de desidratação que consistiu na secagem em estufa de circulação de ar forçada a uma temperatura de 65 °C até peso constante. A curva de desidratação foi obtida em função dos intervalos de tempo de pesagem. Para as demais variáveis utilizou-se o delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com cinco tratamentos e cinco repetições. A desidratação de caule e folhas teve resposta linear com platô, maior para diâmetros de 5 mm cuja perda foi de 0, 02 g de água/g matéria seca ao final de 15, 84 horas no caule, e de 0, 01 g de água/g MS na folha a partir 13, 48 horas. Os teores de proteína bruta do caule diminuíram e os de fibra em detergente neutro e fibra em detergente ácido aumentaram com o diâmetro do caule, mas não houve influência na composição química da folha. Se o objetivo for qualidade, os caules de Jurema preta devem ser cortados com diâmetros inferiores a 6 mm; se o objetivo for quantidade o diâmetro deve ser de 7 a 9 mm; se a finalidade for adequar qualidade e quantidade, recomenda-se cortar os caules ao atingirem 6 mm de diâmetro. The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the effect of stem diameter in branch dehydration, chemical composition and hay production in Jurema preta (Mimosa tenuiflora). The selected plants were about three feet high and were {{in the end of}} blooming. Representative branches were selected with 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 mm diameters, which were sliced and separated into stems and leaves and submitted to the dehydration process. It consisted of drying in the forced air circulation stove at a 65 °C temperature until the constant weight was reached. The dehydration curve was obtained according to the <b>weighing</b> <b>time</b> intervals. The other variables used a completely randomized design with five treatments and five replications. The stem and leaves dehydration had a linear response with plateau, being greater at 5 mm, with 0. 02 g water/g DM in the stems after 15. 84 hours and 0. 01 g water/g DM in the leaves after 13. 48 hours. The stem CP decreased and the NDF and ADF increased with the diameter of the branch, but it did not influence the leaf’s chemical composition. If the goal is branch quality in Jurema preta, they should be cut with diameters smaller than 6 mm; if the goal is quantity, with diameters from 7 to 9 mm; but if the aim is to match quality and quantity, it is recommended to cut the branches when they reach a diameter of 6 mm...|$|E

40|$|Compac are {{interested}} in the weighing of fruit in a very short time, in an assembly-line situation.

Compac find that their low-pass filter and averaging technique is not as accurate as they would like, for heavier fruit and shorter <b>weighing</b> <b>times.</b> In this report, we consider and solve simple models for harmonic motion, for bouncing and for rocking of fruit. We also consider beam-bending equations for the motion of a load cell, and power spectra of fruit weighing data produced by Compac. Some consideration is given to using the data to fit critical parameters for the load cells, which govern how they vibrate when loaded with fruit. We find that the bouncing (and not the rocking) of fruit is the likely cause of the lower frequency oscillations that affect accuracy for heavier fruit and/or faster speeds. 1...|$|R
