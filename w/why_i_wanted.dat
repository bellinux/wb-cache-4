His {{character}} was initially described as [...] "a handsome and masculine but sensitive therapist who loves his family but has hurt his wife." [...] McDermott stated {{that he wanted to}} do the role to break away from his previous role as Bobby Donnell in the ABC series The Practice. [...] "This was exactly <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do this show – to change it up and do a different kind of character. People think of me as the guy from The Practice... I wanted to turn that [...] on its head and hopefully I'm doing that [...] ", he said.|$|E

He plays Leo Morrison, a newly-wed photographer visiting modern-day Briarcliff Manor, an insane asylum, on honeymoon with wife Teresa, played by Jenna Dewan Tatum. The scenes were shot around his summer touring schedule. In an interview with E!, {{he said of his}} role: [...] "It sounded like so much fun and that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do it ... this sounds, like, hysterical, funny, dark and cool and right up my alley". However, he admitted to not being a fan of the show nor horror genre in general, stating he didn't watch the episodes because [...] "it's just so weird and disturbing".|$|E

500|$|Although he was {{permitted}} by XL to remix I'm New Here, Jamie xx wrote longhand letters to Scott-Heron for his approval {{to rework the}} other vocal material: [...] "Originally, I sent him the album {{and there were a}} couple of tracks he wasn't sure about. I had to write to him—he does handwritten letters, not e-mail—and explain <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to use some of his older vocal tracks on the album ... So after I wrote him the letter, he said I was free to do whatever because he knew what I was doing". Scott-Heron was credited as a producer for the album, along with Russell and Malcolm Cecil, a producer and engineer on Scott-Heron's past work. The original vocals had been produced and engineered at Clinton Studios and Looking Glass Studios in New York. We're New Here was mixed at London's XL Studio, where additional recording also took place.|$|E
500|$|I {{will not}} go on to other matters without {{pointing}} out to you that I chose the present Ionic order, from amongst all others, in order to ornament and to give lustre to the palace, which Her Majesty the Queen, mother of the most Christian King Charles IX, today is having built at Paris ... The other reason <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to use and to show the Ionic order properly, on the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, is because it is feminine and was devised according to the proportions and beauties of women and goddesses, as was the Doric to those of men, {{which is what the}} ancients have told me: for, when they decided to build a temple to a god, they used the Doric, and to a goddess, the Ionic. Yet all architects have not followed that , shown in Vitruvius's text ... accordingly I have made use, at the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, of the Ionic order, on the view that it is delicate and of greater beauty than the Doric, and more ornamented and enriched with distinctive features.|$|E
500|$|After {{the tour}} was confirmed, Madonna and her troupe {{started working on}} it. Madonna {{wanted it to be}} [...] "loud and brazen, and a {{reflection}} of my street-style and DGAF attitude." [...] She wanted a concert where people can enjoy themselves as much as she would enjoy performing. Commenting on the development, Madonna said [...] "I normally hate performances where there is just a singer singing, and a lame-ass band playing in the background; or shows where there is a rocker screaming his lungs out and jumping on the crowd. That just plain sucks! That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> something different, something that would be memorable." [...] For the show, Madonna collaborated with her designer friend Maripol for the clothes and the fashion. Maripol operated a small fabric boutique called Maripolitan in Greenwich Village, where the designs and the clothes for the tour were decided by her and Madonna. Rehearsals for the show started in late February, with auditions and choosing the dancers going on in-between. Madonna specifically wanted male back-up dancers, citing that the [...] "provocating moves that I do on stage works better with men beside me." [...] To further promote the tour, Warner Bros. Entertainers Merchandise Management Corp. introduced [...] the Boy Toy collection, named after the belt buckle Madonna wore on the Like a Virgin album cover picture. It consisted of a rectangular buckle, with the words [...] "Boy" [...] and [...] "Toy" [...] emblazed on it in gold color. For choosing a music director for the tour, Madonna's manager Freddy DeMann contacted record producer Patrick Leonard, who had just returned from the Victory Tour by The Jackson 5. At first Leonard said no, feeling exhausted from the Victory Tour, but after he spoke to Madonna on the phone, he found her charming, and agreed to sign for the tour.|$|E

[...] "I thought {{that we were going to}} show what it’s like to be a same-sex couple in a loving, committed relationship dealing with what life throws at them and the outside world and how they are treated.

The fee that gets mentioned is invariably the wrong figure, it keeps being quoted as £19million, {{but that was not the}} price we paid for him."

2500|$|Curtis's second-in-command. On {{taking the}} role, Bell said, [...] "The reason <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to {{be a part}} of the film was because of what Director Bong had to say about it; it was his vision that he brought to the table and I thought what it stood for was {{important}} to me." [...] When asked of performances that were interpreted differently onscreen from the screenplay, writer Masterson stated, [...] " [...] is very impish and mischievous as Edgar, which I didn't predict from his character. That might just be Jamie." [...] and of his performance, [...] "I think 's performance, a lot of it is improvised, and quite brilliantly." [...] On relating to the character, Bell said, [...] "You know, I come from a very working-class background myself. There was the sense that I had to overcome something and really test myself. So in a way Edgar is very similar, he genuinely doesn't have anything and he's the lowest of the low of these people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hilarie Burton portrays Peyton Sawyer, whose two {{greatest}} passions in {{life are}} music and art; she uses her art to express the issues that play out in her life. After Burton auditioned unsuccessfully for the part of Ed Harris's daughter in the film Radio, the casting department remembered her {{and asked her to}} audition for One Tree Hill. Schwahn said, [...] " [...] is an old soul. She's great. She's always just thrilled to do the job, even though she's kind of new to acting. She's just a joy to be around." [...] When talking about casting the role of Peyton, 'Mark Schwann (I)' said: [...] "They asked <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> Hilarie Burton, and my answer was, 'She has a lot of pain in her eyes. And I want that pain in Peyton's eyes'. We always laugh about it, because Hilarie is like, 'It's a good thing a lot of crummy things happen to me in my life'." [...] Peyton's best friend is Brooke Davis, and she is close friends with Haley as well. In season 1, Peyton is a cheerleader and dates Nathan, the most popular basketball star in Tree Hill High.
