5|$|On 3 September 2004, Hyundai Rotem, Mitsui, RM Transit Technology and dU LexBuild {{received}} {{an order to}} refurbish all 396 carriages, costing S$142.7 million in total. The works included the refurbishment of interior fixtures, the addition of <b>wheelchair</b> <b>spaces,</b> the upgrading of onboard communications equipment, enhancement of the public announcement system, and general improvement of the cars' appearance. SMRT Corporation said the reasons for refurbishment were wear and damage of important components {{over the past two}} decades and water leaks from the air-conditioning system on some trains. The company chose this option instead of buying new rolling stock, which would have cost S$792 million. The first refurbished train began revenue service on 5 November 2006, and all remaining trainsets had been refurbished by the end of 2008.|$|E

25|$|The {{stadium is}} {{equipped}} with lighting for night matches, an electronic scoreboard and broadcast booth. The main stand also houses conference rooms. The main stand has seating for 1,882 people, including 10 <b>wheelchair</b> <b>spaces.</b> The end and side stands are grassed terraces that have a capacity of 1,300 and 1,800 respectively.|$|E
25|$|The seating layout for the VLocity is 2+2, {{with a mix}} of club-style seats {{facing each}} other, and aircraft-style rows. The seats can't be rotated to face any {{particular}} direction, and seat backs do not recline. Four <b>wheelchair</b> <b>spaces</b> are provided in each set through the provision of tip-up seats. The VLocity offers economy-class seating only, although the seat width is equivalent to first class seating on V/Line locomotive-hauled services. In response to passenger feedback, the seatback angle in the intermediate carriages was made 2.5 degrees more upright than the original carriages. New deliveries from July 2010 onwards (VL42 and above) featured a changed seatback angle and new seat fabrics.|$|E

25|$|The 10-car {{test pilot}} train had been {{previously}} scheduled for delivery in 2015, followed by an 18-month testing period. Due to potential access issues for people with disabilities, the pilot car layout was modified by the BART board in February 2015 to include two <b>wheelchair</b> <b>spaces</b> {{in the center of}} the car, as well as alternative layouts for bike and flexible open spaces. More recently, the Canadian manufacturer of the cars encountered delays in other cities and a cancellation in Toronto. A loan bailout from the Canadian government is pending. As of early 2016, the scheduled delivery of the 10-car test train was delayed one year until late 2016. The first 140 cars had been set to begin service in 2017, but this number has since been cut to 54 cars. Delivery of all 775 cars was delayed from 2021 to 2022.|$|E
25|$|The Theatre Royal {{went dark}} on 14 March 2011 {{due to a}} major {{restoration}} of the auditorium, box office, bars and restaurant. The restoration restored the theatre to the original 1901 Frank Matcham Edwardian interior. The whole interior was stripped apart from the original plasterwork which was carefully preserved. The proscenium arch, tiers and boxes were gold leafed and the plasterwork restored. On all levels the seats were replaced with Edwardian-style theatre seats {{in keeping with the}} restoration. The amphitheatre which was removed during previous renovations was restored to offer more leg room and better views than the gallery. This took the theatre to five distinct seating areas, the stalls, grand circle, upper circle, amphitheatre and gallery. <b>Wheelchair</b> <b>spaces</b> were installed on levels which had previously been inaccessible. As well as the boxes near the stage, boxes {{at the rear of the}} grand and upper circles were also restored taking the total number of boxes up to ten. The stage lift and orchestra pit were replaced to offer better facilities for opera and musicals. A new ventilation system was put in place to improve comfort levels in the theatre. New frescos for the lobby and upper circle were commissioned and put in place. This £4.75m project introduced higher standards of comfort and improved energy. The Theatre Royal reopened on 12 September 2011 with Alan Bennett’s epic period drama The Madness of George III; George III was in fact the monarch who gave the Theatre Royal its charter.|$|E

The ICE 3 and ICE T omit the usual train manager's compartment and have an open counter named [...] "ServicePoint" [...] instead.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the refurbishment, {{the class}} 803 service car had 39 second class seats, two <b>wheelchair</b> <b>spaces</b> and a conference {{compartment}} with four seats. Additionally, {{there is the}} conductors' compartment, one compartment for employees of the restaurant car and a wheelchair-accessible toilet including a changing table. The doors are [...] wider compared to other cars to improve accessibility for wheelchairs. There is an additional toilet reserved for employees of the restaurant car to ensure food safety.|$|E
2500|$|The stadium {{was first}} opened in August 1953 and a roof was {{constructed}} over the main stand in September 1961. Lighting {{was installed in}} July 1978 and upgraded in September 2001. Underdrainage was installed in June 1982. The ground was converted to natural grass in November 2001. In March 2002 the end stand was renovated and a new stand opposite the main stand was constructed. Renovation of the main stand was completed in July 2004, increasing the capacity to 4,992 (including 15 <b>wheelchair</b> <b>spaces).</b> In 2007 the stadium hosted the men's soccer event of the National Sports Festival of Japan.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2004 the Phoenix {{announced}} {{that they had the}} funding to construct a new temporary ice rink but problems arose as to exactly where to locate the facility. As a result, the deadline for inclusion in the EIHL passed, and the Phoenix withdrew from the 2004–05 season. The club had still not managed to build a new venue by the following year, and {{announced that}} the Phoenix would not be part of the 2005–06 season either. [...] In November 2005, the club announced details of a new rink to be built in partnership with Nikal, David McLean and Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council. The new rink would seat 2,026, with 24 <b>wheelchair</b> <b>spaces,</b> and standing for approx 4–500. [...] Planning permission for the rink was finally granted in early January 2006 and construction began on 30 March, with the rink to be sited in Altrincham.|$|E
2500|$|Boston {{also turned}} to Breda for a {{replacement}} for the Boeings. [...] While both the Boeings and Type 7 cars have wide door openings and reserved <b>wheelchair</b> <b>spaces</b> that make them compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Boston's proposed Type 8 car would have a portion of its floor lower to the ground, allowing wheelchair persons to board {{without the need for}} a lift or mini-high platform. [...] To help maintain Green Line service until the Type 8s were expected to be in service and to replace Type 7s destroyed in accidents, the MBTA took delivery of an additional 20 Type 7s from Kinki Sharyo in 1997. Additionally, the MBTA contracted with Amerail (formerly Morrison Knudsen) of Hornell, NY to completely rehabilitate 55 LRVs for extended service. The LRV rehab was intended to add an additional three to five years of service to the cars, and to eliminate the trouble plagued plug doors once and for all by installing traditional folding doors.|$|E
