40|$|We {{formulate}} {{a theory of}} non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states by considering an anisotropic system consisting of coupled, interacting one dimensional wires. We show that Abelian bosonization provides a simple framework for characterizing the Moore Read state, {{as well as the}} more general Read Rezayi sequence. This coupled <b>wire</b> <b>construction</b> provides a solvable Hamiltonian formulated in terms of electronic degrees of freedom, and provides a direct route to characterizing the quasiparticles and edge states in terms of conformal field theory. This construction leads to a simple interpretation of the coset construction of conformal field theory, which is a powerful method for describing non Abelian states. In the present context, the coset construction arises when the original chiral modes are fractionalized into coset sectors, and the different sectors acquire energy gaps due to coupling in "different directions". The coupled <b>wire</b> <b>construction</b> can also can be used to describe anisotropic lattice systems, and provides a starting point for models of fractional and non-Abelian Chern insulators.

Current data indicate that vascular brachytherapy is a safe and accessible adjunctive endovascular maneuver that may improve the short-term patency rate of peripheral endovascular applications.

40|$|Today, {{the logic}} {{unit in the}} signal house and field {{signalling}} devices are connected with multi-core metallic cables; and those signalling facilities in the station yard are controlled by the control commands for signal aspects, reversing of points etc. that are electrically trans-mitted by the combination of voltage at each core wire.

40|$|We {{identify}} field {{theories that}} describe {{the surfaces of}} three-dimensional bosonic point group symmetry protected topological (pgSPT) phases. The anomalous nature of the surface field theories is revealed via a dimensional reduction argument. Specifically, we study three different surface field theories. The first field theory is quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions (QED 3) with four flavors of fermions. We show this theory can describe the surfaces {{of a majority of}} bosonic pgSPT phases protected by a single mirror reflection, or by C_nv point group symmetry for n= 2, 3, 4, 6. The second field theory is a variant of QED 3 with charge- 1 and charge- 3 Dirac fermions. This field theory can describe the surface of a reflection symmetric pgSPT phase built by placing an E_ 8 state on the mirror plane. The third field theory is an O(4) non-linear sigma model with a topological theta-term at θ=π, or, equivalently, a non-compact CP^ 1 model. Using a coupled <b>wire</b> <b>construction,</b> we show this is a surface theory for bosonic pgSPT phases with U(1) ×Z_ 2 ^P symmetry. For the latter two field theories, we discuss the connection to gapped surfaces with topological order. Moreover, we conjecture that the latter two field theories can describe surfaces of more general bosonic pgSPT phases with C_nv point group symmetry. Comment: 16 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

40|$|We study {{hard core}} bosons on a two leg ladder lattice under the orbital {{effect of a}} uniform {{magnetic}} field. At densities which are incommensurate with flux, the ground state is a Meissner state, or a vortex state, depending {{on the strength of}} the flux. When the density is commensurate with the flux, analytical arguments predict the existence of a ground state of central charge c = 1, which displays signatures compatible with the expected Laughlin state at ν= 1 / 2. This differs from the coupled <b>wire</b> <b>construction</b> of the Laughlin state in that there exists a nonzero backscattering term in the edge Hamiltonian. We construct a phase diagram versus density and flux in order to delimit the region where this precursor to the Laughlin state is the ground state, by using a combination of bosonization and numerics based on the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and exact diagonalization. We obtain the phase diagram from local observables and central charge. We use bipartite charge fluctuations to deduce the Luttinger parameter for the edge Luttinger liquid corresponding to the Laughlin state. The properties studied with local observables are confirmed by the long distance behavior of correlation functions. Our findings are consistent with a calculation of the many body ground state transverse conductivity in a thin torus geometry for parameters corresponding to the Laughlin state. The model considered is simple enough such that the precursor to the Laughlin state could be realized in current ultracold atom, Josephson junction array, and quantum circuit experiments.
