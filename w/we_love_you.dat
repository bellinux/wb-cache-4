He {{died as a result of}} a congenital heart defect. Toxicology also confirmed the statement by Gately's partner Cowles that he had been smoking cannabis that evening.|$|E
500|$|Invincible is {{dedicated}} to the fifteen-year-old Afro-Norwegian boy Benjamin [...] "Benny" [...] Hermansen who was stabbed to death by a group of neo-Nazis in Oslo, Norway, in January 2001. The reason for this tribute was partly {{due to the fact that}} another Oslo youth, Omer Bhatti, Jackson's friend, was also a good friend of Hermansen. The dedication in the album reads, [...] "Michael Jackson gives 'special thanks': This album {{is dedicated}} to Benjamin 'Benny' Hermansen. May we continue to remember not to judge man by the color of his skin, but the content of his Character. Benjamin ... <b>we</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> ... may you rest in peace." [...] The album is also dedicated to Nicholette Sottile and his parents Joseph and Katherine Jackson.|$|E

500|$|Rebbie's brother Michael died on June 25, 2009, after {{suffering}} a cardiac arrest. His memorial service was held twelve days later, on July 7, and the finale featured group renditions of the Jackson anthems [...] "We Are the World" [...] and [...] "Heal the World". The singalong featured Michael's siblings (including Rebbie) and the late singer's children. Following the service which was held at Los Angeles' Staples Center Rebbie, along with sisters Janet and La Toya, addressed fans at the nearby L.A. Live entertainment complex: [...] "We are extremely grateful for all the support. <b>We</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> all." [...] In the weeks following Michael's death, it was speculated by media sources that Rebbie would be the primary caregiver for her late brother's children, Prince, Paris, and Blanket. It was stated that even if Michael and Rebbie's mother Katherine were granted custody of the children, Rebbie would care for the siblings {{on a day-to-day basis}} at the Jackson family's Encino home. Katherine was named the legal guardian of them in August 2009 after the death of Michael Jackson. In early 2011, Rebbie announced she'd begun recording for a new album, her first in 14 years. She also performed throughout the states with a set list that contains her best known songs, some of her brothers' songs, and some Motown classics.|$|E

2500|$|A new single, [...] "Unkiss That Kiss", was {{released}} in September 1985 and peaked at no. 77 in the UK. For this single, Duffy had become known as Stephen A.J. Duffy after dropping the [...] "Tin Tin" [...] reference from his stage name. The single {{was the first to}} be taken from the album Because <b>We</b> <b>Love</b> <b>You,</b> released in early 1986, for which he was credited simply as Stephen Duffy. Additional singles from the album were [...] "I Love You" [...] (which peaked at no. 86) and [...] "Something Special" [...] which was a collaboration with Sandii (of Sandii & the Sunsetz), however this single (and the album itself) failed to chart.|$|E
2500|$|The song {{influenced}} the 1975 disco classic [...] "Love to Love You Baby" [...] by singer Donna Summer and producer Giorgio Moroder; they duetted [...] "Je t'aime" [...] in a 15-minute version {{for the film}} Thank God It's Friday in 1978. UK jazz rap group Blown released a trip hop version of the song as a single in 1994. In 1998, Sam Taylor-Wood recorded a cover with the Pet Shop Boys for the compilation CD/book [...] "futique" [...] entitled Ambassadors – <b>We</b> <b>Love</b> <b>You,</b> a concept designed to promote collaboration between visual and musical artists. This track was a bonus on the [...] "I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It Any More" [...] CD single.|$|E
2500|$|The {{response}} was largely positive. Many media outlets lauded Madonna's efforts, and other artists joined her {{in support of}} the band, among them Yoko Ono, Paul McCartney and Peter Gabriel. Pussy Riot themselves tweeted: [...] "DEAR MADONNA! <b>We</b> <b>love</b> <b>you</b> and you just might be changing Russia's history right now. Thank you and a thousand prayers in return!" [...] Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, however, wrote an expletive-ridden Twitter post lambasting Madonna for backing the band: [...] "With age, every ex-slut tends to lecture everybody on morality. Especially during world tours and concerts." [...] Madonna's second Russian date in Saint Petersburg was consequently met with terrorist threats, prompting the U.S. Embassy to issue a warning to those in attendance. Madonna's spokesperson Liz Rosenberg responded that the concert would go on as scheduled and that Russian authorities would step up security for the date.|$|E

2500|$|Besides {{recording}} and touring, during the busy 1970s Chicago also made {{time for a}} movie appearance and several television appearances of note. In 1972, Guercio produced and directed Electra Glide in Blue, a film about an Arizona motorcycle policeman. Released in 1973, the film stars Robert Blake and features Cetera, Kath, Loughnane, and Parazaider in supporting roles. The group also appears prominently on the film's soundtrack. Chicago made its [...] "television variety debut" [...] in February 1973 when {{they were the only}} rock musicians invited to appear on a television special honoring Duke Ellington, [...] "Duke Ellington ... <b>We</b> <b>Love</b> <b>You</b> Madly," [...] which aired on CBS. They performed the Ellington composition, [...] "Jump for Joy." [...] In July 1973 the group starred in a half-hour television special produced by Dick Clark, [...] "Chicago in the Rockies," [...] which aired in prime time on ABC. The show was filmed on location at Caribou Ranch, the 3,000 acre ranch-turned-recording studio located outside of Boulder, Colorado, owned by Chicago's producer, James William Guercio. The only musical guest on the show was Al Green, who was rated the number-one male vocalist of 1972, and whom Rolling Stone magazine named [...] "Rock and Roll Star of the Year." [...] That special was followed by a second hour-long special the next year, [...] "Chicago ... Meanwhile Back at the Ranch," [...] which aired in prime time on ABC in August 1974. [...] "Chicago ... Meanwhile Back at the Ranch" [...] was again shot on location at Caribou Ranch and was again produced by Dick Clark. Singer Anne Murray and country music star Charlie Rich were guests on the show. Chicago recorded five albums at Caribou Ranch: Chicago VI, VII, VIII, X, and XI.|$|E
2500|$|More {{than nine}} {{helicopters}} eventually joined the chase; {{the high degree}} of media participation caused camera signals to appear on incorrect television channels. The chase was so long that one helicopter ran out of fuel, forcing its station to ask another for a camera feed. Radio station KNX also provided live coverage of the low-speed pursuit. USC sports announcer Pete Arbogast and station producer Oran Sampson contacted former USC coach John McKay to go on the air and encourage Simpson to end the pursuit. McKay agreed and asked Simpson to pull over and turn himself in instead of committing suicide; [...] "My God, <b>we</b> <b>love</b> <b>you,</b> Juice. Just pull over and I'll come out and stand by you all the rest of my life", he promised. LAPD detective Tom Lange, who had previously interviewed Simpson about the murders on June 13, realized that he had Simpson's cellular phone number and called him repeatedly. A colleague hooked a tape recorder up to Lange's phone and captured a conversation between Lange and Simpson in which Lange repeatedly pleaded with Simpson to [...] "throw the gun out [...] the window" [...] {{for the sake of his}} mother and children. Simpson apologized for not turning himself in earlier that day and responded that he was [...] "the only one who deserved to get hurt" [...] and was [...] "just gonna go with Nicole." [...] Cowlings' voice is overheard in the recording (after the Bronco had arrived at Simpson's home surrounded by police) pleading with Simpson to surrender and end the chase peacefully. During the pursuit and without having a chance to hear the taped phone conversation, Simpson's friend Al Michaels interpreted his actions as an admission of guilt.|$|E
