He reiterated his desire to play for Manchester United if given a chance and added, [...] "For me, if I could get to play for Manchester United, that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dream come true.

500|$|At {{the height}} of Akhmatova's fame, in 1918, she {{divorced}} her husband and that same year, though many of her friends considered it a mistake, Akhmatova married prominent Assyriologist and poet Vladimir Shilejko. She later said “I felt so filthy. I thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cleansing, like going to a convent, knowing {{you are going to}} lose your freedom.” [...] She began affairs with [...] theatre director Mikhail Zimmerman and composer Arthur Lourié, who set many of her poems to music.|$|E

Paolini based the dragon's behavior and attitude on the pets and animals he grew up around, particularly his pet cats: [...] "I thought a dragon <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cat in some ways, that same sort of self-satisfied attitude." [...] He added that it was challenging to depict scenes from the standpoint of a dragon, but he enjoyed doing it because Saphira [...] "has so many interesting thoughts and opinions." ...|$|E

There's hardly any Hispanic players, no Asian-Americans, so that there's no openly gay players is no real surprise. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> alien dropping down from space.

500|$|In December 2007, Record Collector {{published}} {{an interview with}} Ray Davies in which he said, [...] "I spoke to Quaife {{about a month ago}} and he dearly wants to make another record with me. I think Dave's getting better and Mick's still playing. It would be great to get back together just to see what musical ideas we had, and what would happen." [...] The Daily Mail subsequently interpreted his comments as a declaration that a reunion of the band's original line-up was imminent. Dave Davies swiftly rejected the idea of a reunion. He told a reporter that [...] "it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bad remake of Night of the Living Dead" [...] and added, [...] "Ray has been doing Karaoke Kinks shows since 1996." ...|$|E
500|$|Philippe had {{numerous}} business interests and investments, and {{was responsible for}} building at least three restaurants, a casino, a theater, and an eighteen-hole golf course in Guadeloupe in the 1960s. By 1960, Alexis Lichine and Philippe owned an extensive stretch of beach called Jack Bay. They bought a large parcel of undeveloped land in the French portion of Saint Martin around 1964, [...] Philippe's dream had been to build a luxury resort called La Belle Creole which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tiny portion of France in the Caribbean. [...] Philippe's intended guests were the people he had been acquainted with through his hotel work. [...] His plans were also for a casino, a nightclub and various luxury shops {{as part of the}} resort. [...] The French government was interested enough in the project to assist Philippe by providing a desalination plant and a paved road leading to the potential resort. Philippe hired architects and designers who estimated that it would cost about $5.5 million to make the dream a reality. [...] It was decided to break ground after an investment of $2.5 million, which was enough to construct buildings and begin the resort plans. [...] However, Philippe's funds ran out by 1969 and work on La Belle Creole was suspended.|$|E

2500|$|Eight retired {{generals and}} admirals called for Rumsfeld to resign in early 2006 {{in what was}} called the [...] "Generals Revolt", accusing him of [...] "abysmal" [...] {{military}} planning and lack of strategic competence. Commentator Pat Buchanan reported at the time that Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, who traveled often to Iraq and supported the war, said the generals [...] "mirror the views of 75 percent of the officers in the field, and probably more". Rumsfeld rebuffed these criticisms, stating that [...] "out of thousands and thousands of admirals and generals, if every time two or three people disagreed we changed the secretary of defense of the United States, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> merry-go-round." [...] Bush defended his secretary throughout, and responded by stating that Rumsfeld is [...] "exactly what is needed".|$|E

2500|$|While in {{the process}} of {{creating}} Saint Seiya, Masami Kurumada initially gave Seiya the name Rin, intending to title his manga [...] However, as he continued developing the story, he changed the name to Seiya, which he felt was more fitting. First he used the name with the Japanese characters that mean , to relate it to Seiya's condition as a Saint, but later decided to spell it as [...] "star arrow", to emphasize the constellation and mythological motif. Finally, he changed the title of the manga to Saint Seiya, once the concept of the Saints was fully developed. Kurumada stated that one of the first ideas he had for Saint Seiya was the [...] "Pegasus Meteor Fist". Since his manga was going to use the constellations as a very important and ever-present theme, he wanted his protagonist to have a special move that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> shower of meteors.|$|E

Gentle, soft-spoken, immaculately tanned, he looks a good two decades younger than his 78 years". In such interviews, he refuses to disclose information on his name change from Anglemeyer to Anger, telling an interviewer who brought the topic up in 2004 that [...] "You're being impertinent. It says Anger on my passport, that's all you need to know. I would stay away from that subject if I were you." [...] In a 2010 interview, however, he stated that [...] "I just condensed my name. I knew it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> label, a logo. It's easy to remember." [...] Anger is openly gay, with one of his friends describing how he [...] "was attracted to people who were either well endowed or the Arnold Schwarzenegger type." [...] He once joked that he was [...] "somewhat {{to the right of the}} KKK" [...] in his views about black people, opening him up to criticism for racism. He is a passionate supporter of the Tibetan independence movement.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{attempts}} at founding a band proved unsuccessful. After turning 22, {{he says he}} was contacted by Aftermath Entertainment about showcasing his musical talents, but the opportunity ultimately fell through. For the next few years, Foster waited tables at a cafe while dealing with writer's block, but he remained in Los Angeles after landing a job as a commercial jingle writer for Mophonics in 2008. He said of the profession, [...] "I definitely learned from the commercial standpoint what works," [...] and he credited it with reviving his confidence in performing. The music Foster wrote spanned a wide range of genres, but he had difficulty reconciling his eclectic compositions. He explained: [...] "I'd write one song and it'd be a hip-hop song. I'd write another and it'd be heavily electronic. Another <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> spiritual, and another would be classic piano song. I was constantly trying to pull those elements together. It took me six years to do it." [...] He still wished {{to be part of a}} group; reflecting on a residency he did at a venue performing electronic music, he said, [...] "It was just me and a laptop. Really, it was terrible. I knew I needed a band." ...|$|E
