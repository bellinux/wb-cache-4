5|$|The entire filmmaking process <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{complex than}} that of most Romanian movies made after 1948. The picture stands out {{through the use of}} various effects, such as split-screen, and the use of {{hand-held}} filming.|$|E
5|$|Another {{political}} {{opponent of}} the TSR-2 project was Sir Solly Zuckerman, {{at the time the}} Chief Scientific Advisor to the Ministry of Defence. Zuckerman had an extremely low opinion of British technological achievements and <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> in favour of procuring military hardware from the United States.|$|E

5|$|Elementary {{education}} was widely available {{throughout most of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence, in towns and occasionally in the countryside. This, in turn, ensured that literacy <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> widespread than in Western Europe, at least until the twelfth century. Secondary {{education was}} confined to the larger cities while higher education was the exclusive provenance of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|For example, when {{comparing}} the imaginary {{part of the}} refractive index k of stratospheric ash from 15km and 18km from the volcano it has been discovered that they have similar values around 700nm (around 0.009), while they differ significantly around 300nm. Here, the 18km (k {{was found to be}} around 0.009) sample <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> absorbent than the 15km sample (k was found to be around 0.002).|$|E
5|$|Modem Wars, {{released}} in 1988 for DOS and the Commodore 64, {{was the first}} RTS with multiplayer games by means of modems. Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, which allow two gamers to compete by modem or local networks, persuaded a wider audience that multiplayer competition <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> challenging than contests against the artificial intelligence (AI), and made multiplayer facilities essential for future RTS titles.|$|E
50|$|Also, Oiwa <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> direct in her vengeance than Okiku, {{another popular}} kabuki ghost, and she <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> brutal. This added level of {{violence}} thrilled audiences, who were seeking more and more violent forms of entertainment.|$|R

The ship frequently conveyed royalty on their foreign tours and served as flagship of the Battlecruiser Squadron when Hood was refitting.|$|E
5|$|The East Angles formed one of {{the seven}} kingdoms known to post-mediaeval historians as the Heptarchy, a scheme used by Henry of Huntingdon in the twelfth century. Some modern historians have {{questioned}} whether seven independent kingdoms ever really existed contemporaneously, and claim that the political situation <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> complicated.|$|E
5|$|The last {{significant}} extension {{was added}} in 1920, {{which was designed}} by the Luttrell Brothers. The south-east wing <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{in keeping with the}} original design. It is possible that the architects designed a second storey for the service wing that had been built in 1889. This extension connected the original house with the original washhouse.|$|E

5|$|Two endings {{were created}} for the special. The {{alternative}} ending is included on the DVD release of Green Wing, along with deleted scenes from the episode. The alternative ending was planned to be used if a third series {{was going to be}} commissioned, as this ending <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> ambiguous. It is known that the actors wanted the alternative ending, but after some debate, it was not shown.|$|E
5|$|After a {{subsequent}} tour, Iron Maiden {{started working on}} their next studio effort, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, which featured more progressive rock elements than the band's previous records. Although it became their second release to top the UK charts, it was also Dickinson's first album with the band that did not achieve platinum status in the US. Unlike Somewhere in Time, Dickinson <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> enthusiastic about this album due to its concept and has several song-writing credits. After the following tour in 1988, the band {{decided to take a}} year off.|$|E
5|$|After the Treaties of Tilsit of July 1807 Metternich {{saw that}} Austria's {{position}} in Europe <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> vulnerable but believed the accord between Russia and France would not last. In the meantime {{he found the}} new French Foreign Minister, Jean-Baptiste Champagny unaccommodating and struggled to negotiate a satisfactory settlement {{over the future of}} several French forts on the River Inn. Over the following months the reach of Austrian policy, and Metternich's own reputation, increased. Metternich pushed for a Russo-Austrian alliance, though Tsar Alexander was too preoccupied with the three other wars he was engaged in to commit. Over time, Metternich came to see an eventual war with France as inevitable.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, on the {{northern}} flank, the 10th Division <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> successful. Instead of waiting for orders from General Żeligowski, the commanding officer of the 10th Division, Lieutenant Colonel Wiktor Thommée, started a push along the southern bank of the Bugonarew. The 28th and 29th Kaniów Rifles Infantry Regiments managed to reach the village of Mokre, on a small hill overlooking Radzymin and the Białystok-Warsaw road, directly behind the Russian lines. The Russians tried to push the Poles back from that position, but ultimately failed. Their assault on the village of Wiktorów also ended in failure. Soon the Polish positions in Mokre were secured, and further reinforced with {{the remainder of the}} 1st Battalion, 28th Regiment.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s {{electrical}} resonance <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> widely {{understood and}} had become {{a normal part of}} the engineer's toolkit. In 1891 Hutin and Leblanc patented an FDM scheme for telephone circuits using resonant circuit filters. Rival patents were filed in 1892 by Michael Pupin and John Stone Stone with similar ideas, priority eventually being awarded to Pupin. However, no scheme using just simple resonant circuit filters can successfully multiplex (i.e. combine) the wider bandwidth of telephone channels (as opposed to telegraph) without either an unacceptable restriction of speech bandwidth or a channel spacing so wide as to make the benefits of multiplexing uneconomic.|$|E
5|$|During heavy rains, it <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{difficult}} to track insurgents by air, negating Portugal's air superiority, and Portuguese troops and vehicles found movement during rain storms difficult. In contrast, the insurgent troops, with lighter equipment, {{were able to}} flee into the bush (the mato) amongst an ethnically similar populace into which they could melt away. Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces were able to forage food from the surroundings and local villages, and were thus not hampered by long supply lines.|$|E

5|$|Encouraged by Nogai, in 1292 Shishman {{launched}} a major campaign against Milutin, his Serbian neighbour to the west. Thanks {{to the support}} of Tatar mercenaries, Shishman's forces raided deeply into Serbian territory and reached Hvosno in Kosovo. After attempting to conquer the fortress of Ždrelo near Peć to no avail and burning the Žiča monastery, Shishman's troops returned to Vidin without any territorial gains. Milutin's response to Shishman's act of aggression <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> successful. His counter-attack resulted in Serbian forces reaching Vidin and capturing Shishman's capital after a brief siege. The despot, however, managed to escape north of the Danube {{to the safety of}} his Tatar suzerains.|$|E
5|$|Escape from New York was {{released}} in the United States on July 10, 1981. The film received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing over $25 million at the box office. The film was nominated for four Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film and Best Direction. The film became a cult classic and {{was followed by a}} sequel, Escape from L.A. (1996), which was also directed and written by Carpenter and starred Russell but which <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> poorly received.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{this design}} would prove too {{advanced}} and expensive for Reynolds. He instead devised an alternate {{design of the}} Reynolds Building, {{which was published in}} August 1928. The new design <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> conservative, with an Italianate dome that a critic compared to Governor Al Smith's bowler hat, and a brick arrangement on the upper floors that simulated windows in the corners, a detail that remains in the current Chrysler Building. This design almost exactly reflected the shape, setbacks, and the layout of the windows of the current building, but with a different dome.|$|E
