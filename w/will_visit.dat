5|$|Foraging workers often visit Pisonia {{flowers and}} will {{feed on the}} nectar. Other flowers they <b>will</b> <b>visit</b> include Canavalia, Commicarpus, Ipomoea, Melanthera, Plumbago and Scaevola. Ochetellus flavipes {{regularly}} attends the mealybug Prorsococcus acanthodus and protects it by building shelters. They also attend a number of butterfly larvae, including Anthene lycaenoides (Pale Ciliate Blue), Ogyris amaryllis (Satin Azure), Ogyris olane (Olane Azure) and Ogyris oroetes (Silky Azure).|$|E
5|$|However, {{even though}} on a per-individual basis, many other species are {{actually}} more efficient at pollinating, on the 30% of crop types where honey bees are used, most native pollinators cannot be mass-utilized as easily or {{as effectively as}} honey bees—in many instances they will not visit the plants at all. Beehives can be moved from crop to crop as needed, and the bees <b>will</b> <b>visit</b> many plants in large numbers, compensating via saturation pollination for what they lack in efficiency. The commercial viability of these crops is therefore strongly tied to the beekeeping industry. In China, hand pollination of apple orchards is labor-intensive, time consuming, and costly.|$|E

5|$|The American crow is omnivorous. It {{will feed}} on {{invertebrates}} of all types, carrion, scraps of human food, seeds, eggs and nestlings, stranded {{fish on the}} shore and various grains. American crows are active hunters and will prey on mice, frogs, and other small animals. In winter and autumn, the diet of American crows is more dependent on nuts and acorns. Occasionally, they <b>will</b> <b>visit</b> bird feeders. The American crow {{is one of only}} a few species of bird that has been observed modifying and using tools to obtain food.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to a certain extent, have {{control over their own}} health and well-being. They tell their husbands that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous and encourage them to refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact. In addition, many women are convinced that, by appealing to the vulnerability of their children (who will probably be orphaned if their parents contract HIV), they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters. Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they <b>will</b> <b>visit</b> the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E
5|$|In flashbacks, Ann is {{hired by}} a wealthy and {{sophisticated}} aristocrat (Umbers) {{to act as}} a governess for his orphaned nephew and niece who live at Bly. He tells her that he is not to be bothered in London, and that Ann is to deal with any problems that may arise. Ann travels to Bly, where she meets the all-female household staff—led by Mrs Sarah Grose (Johnston), the housekeeper—and then the young Flora (Sayer), one of Ann's new pupils. Ann finds the house somewhat unnerving, and the staff standoffish and unwilling to talk. Ann subsequently receives a letter informing her that Miles (Lindsay), her other pupil, has been expelled from his boarding school, but is assured by Mrs Grose that Miles is well behaved. When he arrives at Bly, Ann finds Miles to be charming, and although he does not explain what happened at school, she does not push him. Her interactions with the children are idyllic, and they sail on Bly's lake and enjoy picnics together. Meanwhile, Ann fantasises about the Master, futilely hoping that he <b>will</b> <b>visit.</b>|$|E

5|$|Registered Nurses: Registered {{nurses are}} {{responsible}} for coordinating {{all aspects of the}} patient's care and insuring symptoms (physical or otherwise) are being addressed and managed. The primary care nurse visits a minimum of twice weekly, and the content of the visit can vary greatly. When patients are experiencing few symptoms and/or are early in their diseases, the RN visit may just be a short check up. If a patient's symptoms worsen, the nurse <b>will</b> <b>visit</b> more often, make recommendations for increasing or changing the medication intervention and provide support and education regarding the disease/dying process. Many patients on hospice may require complex treatments: respiratory care, wound care or even IV therapy at home. In most cases, the hospice nurse is trained to handle these unique needs as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{city was}} a home port for cruise ships from Carnival Cruise Lines. The first cruise ship {{to call the}} port home was the Holiday, which left the city in November 2009 so that a larger and newer ship could take its place. The Carnival Fantasy {{operated}} from Mobile from then on until the Carnival Elation arrived in May 2010. In early 2011, Carnival announced that despite fully booked cruises, the company would cease operations from Mobile in October 2011. This cessation of cruise service left the city with an annual debt service of around two million dollars related to the terminal. In September 2015, Carnival announced that the Carnival Fantasy was relocating from Miami, Florida to Mobile, Alabama after a five-year absence and would offer four and five night cruises to Mexico that started in November 2016 through November 2017.
