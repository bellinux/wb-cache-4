5|$|Like most known tyrannosaurids, Tarbosaurus {{was a large}} bipedal predator, <b>weighing</b> <b>up</b> to five tonnes and {{equipped}} with about sixty large teeth. It had a unique locking mechanism in its lower jaw and the smallest forelimbs relative to body size of all tyrannosaurids, renowned for their disproportionately tiny, two-fingered forelimbs.|$|E
5|$|The first {{berkelium}} metal sample weighing 1.7micrograms {{was prepared}} in 1971 by {{the reduction of}} berkelium(III) fluoride with lithium vapor at 1000°C; the fluoride was suspended on a tungsten wire above a tantalum crucible containing molten lithium. Later, metal samples <b>weighing</b> <b>up</b> to 0.5milligrams were obtained with this method.|$|E
5|$|They are a notably sexually dimorphic species, females being {{consistently}} {{smaller than}} males. The size difference {{between males and}} females is proportionally greater in the larger tiger subspecies, with males <b>weighing</b> <b>up</b> to 1.7 times more than females. Males also have wider forepaw pads than females, enabling gender to be told from tracks.|$|E

5|$|Beavers, rodents <b>weighing</b> <b>up</b> to , have {{sometimes}} caused problems along Fanno Creek. In 2014 and 2015, a growing population of beavers gnawed down trees and dammed the creek in Greenway Park in Beaverton. Rising waters have covered {{one of the}} side trails in the park, which has been gated and closed. During heavy rains, water from the beaver pond sometimes covers the main trail. Park officials are considering a variety of options, including re-routing the trails, building a boardwalk over the water, or removing the beaver dams.|$|E
5|$|The {{less common}} tigon is {{a cross between}} a lioness and a male tiger. Because the male tiger does not pass on a growth-promoting gene and the lioness passes on a growth {{inhibiting}} gene, tigons are often relatively small, only <b>weighing</b> <b>up</b> to 150kg (350lb), which is about 10–20% smaller than lions. Like ligers, they have physical and behavioural traits from both parental species, and males are sterile. Females are sometimes fertile and have occasionally given birth to litigons when mated to a lion.|$|E
5|$|The {{queen conch}} reaches sexual {{maturity}} at approximately 3 to 4 years of age, reaching a shell length of nearly 180mm and <b>weighing</b> <b>up</b> to 5 pounds. Individuals may usually {{live up to}} 7 years, though in deeper waters their lifespan may reach 20–30 years and maximum lifetime estimates reach 40 years. It is believed that the mortality rate tends to be lower in matured conchs due to their thickened shell, {{but it could be}} substantially higher for juveniles. Estimates have demonstrated that its mortality rate decreases as its size increases and can also vary due to habitat, season and other factors.|$|E

50|$|Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) is {{a species}} of sheep in North America with large horns. The horns can <b>weigh</b> <b>up</b> to 30 lb, while the sheep {{themselves}} <b>weigh</b> <b>up</b> to 300 lb. Recent genetic testing indicates {{that there are three}} distinct subspecies of Ovis canadensis, one of which is endangered: Ovis canadensis sierrae.|$|R
50|$|Wiltipoll sheep may <b>weigh</b> <b>up</b> to 125 kg under {{reasonable}} conditions.|$|R
5|$|Sexual size {{dimorphism}} in {{this species}} {{is perhaps the}} greatest in any neognath bird. Males were considerably larger than females, measuring 90cm (35in) in length and <b>weighing</b> <b>up</b> to 28kg (62lb), whereas females were 70cm (28in) and weighed 17kg (37lb). This is only 60% {{of the weight of}} a mature male. Their weight may have varied substantially due to fat cycles, meaning that individuals were fat during cool seasons, but slim during hot seasons, and may have been as low as 21kg in males and 13kg in females. Though male pigeons are usually larger than females, there is no direct evidence for the largest specimens actually being the males of the species, and this has only been assumed based on early works. Though the male was probably largest, this can only be confirmed by molecular sexing techniques, and not skeletal morphology alone.|$|E
5|$|The Zephyrs power (leading) car was {{numbered}} 9900, the baggage-coach {{combine car}} 505, and the coach-observation 570. The train {{was placed in}} regular service between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska, on November 11, 1934, replacing a pair of steam locomotives and six heavyweight passenger cars, <b>weighing</b> <b>up</b> to eight {{times as much as}} the Zephyr. By June 1935, it proved popular enough to add a fourth car, providing additional coach seating. The fourth car was originally a 40-seat coach number 525, but the following June it was switched to Twin Cities service, then back to the Pioneer Zephyr in December. Car 525 remained on the train until June 1938. Just over five years after it was introduced, the Pioneer Zephyr crossed the one million mile mark in regular service on December 29, 1939, near Council Bluffs, Iowa.|$|E
5|$|Mammalian prey {{includes}} rabbits, hares, ground squirrels, raccoons (Procyon lotor), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), beavers (Castor canadensis), {{and deer}} fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the Chesapeake Bay area, bald eagles are reportedly the main natural predators of raccoons. Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On Protection Island, Washington, they commonly feed on harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. On San Juan Island in Washington, introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the dietary intake of eagles. In landlocked areas of North America, wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals {{that occur in}} colonies or local concentrations, such as prairie dogs (Cynomys) and jackrabbits (Lepus). Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially sheep (Ovis aries). There {{are a handful of}} proven cases of lamb predation, some of specimens <b>weighing</b> <b>up</b> to , by bald eagles but they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods. There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over , is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.|$|E
50|$|Bighorns {{from the}} Rocky Mountains are {{relatively}} large, with males that occasionally exceed 500 lb and females that exceed 200 lb. In contrast, Sierra Nevada bighorn males <b>weigh</b> <b>up</b> to only 200 lb and females to 140 lb.

25|$|The B7A had a weight-carrying {{capacity}} {{stemming from}} its requirements, {{resulting in a}} weapons load no greater than its predecessors. The presence of an internal bomb bay with two high-load-capability attachment points allowed the aircraft to carry two 250kg (550lb) or six 60kg (132lb) bombs. Alternatively, it could carry a single externally mounted Type 91 torpedo, <b>weighing</b> <b>up</b> to 848kg (1,870lb).|$|E

25|$|Upton et al.

They concluded;In our view, the plain wording of section 5 is easy enough to understand without recourse to concepts like sustainable development that are not referred to, or the insistence that an anthropogenic reading of the section must necessarily involve <b>weighing</b> <b>up</b> everything against everything else.|$|E
25|$|A {{much wider}} range of shapes, sizes, and colors is grown in India and {{elsewhere}} in Asia. Larger cultivars <b>weighing</b> <b>up</b> to a kilogram (2.2 pounds) grow in the region between the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers, while smaller ones are found elsewhere. Colors vary from white to yellow or green, as well as reddish-purple and dark purple. Some cultivars have a color gradient—white at the stem, to bright pink, deep purple or even black. Green or purple cultivars with white striping also exist. Chinese cultivars are commonly shaped like a narrower, slightly pendulous cucumber. Also, Asian cultivars of Japanese breeding are grown.|$|E
