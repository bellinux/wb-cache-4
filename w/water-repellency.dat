50|$|Certain {{types of}} fabrics {{need to be}} re-treated to {{maintain}} <b>water-repellency,</b> as fluoropolymers decompose over time when exposed to water and chemicals. Washing the garment with harsh detergents usually accelerates DWR loss; in addition, soaps often leave a residue which attracts water and dirt. On the other hand, rain water or salt water affects DWRs less significantly. Affected garments can be treated with a 'spray-on' or 'wash-in' treatment to improve <b>water-repellency.</b> In some cases heat treatment can reactivate the factory applied repellent finish and aid in the repelling of water, and other liquids such as oils. On the other hand, some DWR products do not require heat treatment to be activated, and sometimes DWR treatments can be revitalized simply by washing the fabric with a suitable cleaner.|$|E

50|$|Durable water repellent, or DWR, is a coating {{added to}} fabrics {{at the factory}} to make them {{water-resistant}} (or hydrophobic). Most factory-applied treatments are fluoropolymer based. Durable water repellents are commonly {{used in conjunction with}} waterproof breathable fabrics such as Gore-Tex to prevent the outer layer of fabric from becoming saturated with water. This saturation, called 'wetting out,' can reduce the garment's breathability (moisture transport through the breathable membrane) and let water through. As the DWR wears off over time, re-treatment is recommended when necessary. Many spray-on and wash-in products for treatment of non-waterproof garments and re-treatment of proofed garments losing their <b>water-repellency</b> are available from sources of sporting apparel.|$|E
40|$|To {{improve the}} <b>water-repellency</b> of materials, a {{composite}} coating of fluorine-carbon {{has been developed}} in this study. A thermal sprayed coating produced by using a compound fluorine-carbon cored wire exhibits excellent <b>water-repellency.</b> However, the contact angles of water of the coating surface show remarkable scatters since the fluorine is usually difficult to be distributed uniformly on the coating surface. To improve the homogeneity of the <b>water-repellency</b> of the thermal sprayed coating, a surface modification using silane solution was further processed. Optimal processing conditions were investigated. The results show that highly cross-linked polymers characterized with <b>water-repellency</b> were formed on the sprayed coating, and the scatter of the contact angle is decreased. Empirically, the contact angle of the coated surface was 130 ± 5 °for water...|$|E
40|$|Alkylketene dimer (AKD), {{a kind of}} wax, {{has been}} known to form fractal {{surfaces}} spontaneously, and to show super water-repellent property. In order to understand further the super <b>water-repellency</b> of the AKD surfaces and to elucidate the mechanism of spontaneous formation of the fractal structures on the wax surfaces, a pure and a mixed AKD samples were employed to make the surfaces by the melt-solidification method. Time-dependent contact angles of water droplets on the AKD surfaces cured at several temperatures were systematically measured. It was found that spontaneous formation of super water-repellent surfaces was thermally induced quite effectively. For example, it took about 6 days for the pure AKD surface to show the super <b>water-repellency</b> at 40 oC but did just 1 hour at 50 oC. The fractal dimension of the mixed AKD surface with super <b>water-repellency</b> was calculated to be 2. 26 from the SEM images by the box-counting method which should be reasonably compared with 2. 29 of pure AKD surface. The mechanism for the spontaneous formation of fractal structures was discussed from the results of the time-dependent contact angles, differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) curves and X-ray diffractometric (XRD) patterns. It has been made clear that the fractal AKD surface and its super <b>water-repellency</b> result from the phase transformation from the metastable state to the stable one of the AKD crystals...|$|E

Surprisingly, the alkyl chain length has a very important infl uence on the surface morphology and as a consequence on the <b>water-repellency</b> properties. The amount of the nanoporosity and the <b>water-repellency</b> properties can be controlled with alkyl chain length.

40|$|The rough {{integument}} of water-walking arthropods {{is well-known}} {{to be responsible}} for their <b>water-repellency</b> [1], [2], [3] and [4]; however, water-repellent surfaces generally experience reduced traction at an air–water interface [5], [6], [7] and [8]. A conundrum then arises as to how such creatures generate significant propulsive forces while retaining their <b>water-repellency.</b> We here demonstrate through a series of experiments that they do so by virtue of the detailed form of their integument; specifically, their tilted, flexible hairs interact with the free surface to generate directionally anisotropic adhesive forces that facilitate locomotion. We thus provide new rationale for the fundamental topological difference in the roughness on plants and water-walking arthropods, and suggest new directions for the design and fabrication of unidirectional superhydrophobic surfaces...|$|E

Hermetically carbon-coated optical fibers are prepared by thermal chemical vapor deposition using methane as the precursor gas. The deposition temperatures are 900, 925, 950, 975 and 1000 degrees C. The deposition rate, microstructure, electrical resistivity and Young's modulus of the carbon films are measured. The <b>water-repellency</b> and low-temperature surface morphology of carbon-coated optical fibers are elucidated.

40|$|The {{effect of}} coating {{thickness}} and roughness on <b>water-repellency</b> and thermally induced voids/cracks in copper-coated optical fibers is investigated. Seven samples of copper-coated optical fibers with identical fiber length but different coating thicknesses were prepared using electroless plating. The thicknesses of copper coatings were 62, 89, 127, 154, 165, 206, and 25 1 nm, respectively. Atomic force microscope measurement {{reveals that the}} roughness of copper coating increases when increasing the coating thickness. It is found that if the coating thickness is less than 89 nm, the water contact angle slightly increases with increasing the coating thickness, while fewer thermally induced voids/cracks are found in copper coatings. If the coating thickness is {{in the range of}} 89 to 25 1 nm, the water contact angle decreases when increasing the coating thickness, while the number of thermally induced voids/cracks increases when increasing the coating thickness. To get copper-coated optical fibers with high <b>water-repellency</b> and few thermally induced voids/cracks, the surface roughness of copper coatings should be diminished...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{annealing}} on {{the properties of}} hermetically carbon-coated optical fibers are investigated. The hermetically carbon-coated optical fibers are prepared by the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method using methane and hydrogen as the precursor gases. The annealing temperatures are selected at 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 degrees C, respectively. The thickness, optical band gap, and microstructure of carbon films are measured. Meanwhile, the <b>water-repellency</b> and low-temperature surface morphology of carbon-coated optical fibers are evaluated. The {{results indicate that the}} thickness and defect content of the carbon films decrease with increasing the annealing temperature, while the degree of structure order and the amount of microcrystalline graphite in the carbon films increase. When the annealing temperature is over 300 degrees C, the carbon films acquire enough thermal energy to cause a great amount of hydrogen and hydrocarbon to be released, and the carbon films transform to the graphitelike structure. Additionally, based on the evaluation of <b>water-repellency</b> and low temperature-induced break or delamination of carbon films, it is found that the carbon film annealed at 300 degrees C is the best one for use as the hermetic optical fiber coating.

40|$|A surface having water {{contact angle}} (WCA) higher than 150 o is named as superhydrophobic surface. To exhibit superhydrophobic feature, a surface should have micron scale {{roughness}} on an inherently hydrophobic material. This extreme <b>water-repellency</b> feature has found many applications both in industry and in daily-life. Current production processes of superhydrophobic surfaces are either time consuming or expensive. A cost-effective, widely applicable and practical way of production is necessary. In this study, superhydrophobic surfaces were generated by utilization of electrospinning process, {{which is a}} continuous nanofiber production process from a polymeric solution under an electrical field. By this method, a straightforward and inexpensive way to fabricate very stable superhydrophobic surfaces with an advantage of tunable WCA and low sliding angle were discovered. Poly-(acrylonitrile-co-dimethyl meta-isopropenyl benzyl isocyanate) polymer was synthesized, and electrospun after {{the addition of a}} fluorinated hydroxyl-ended oligomer. The effects of viscosity of electrospinning solution, fluorine content and molecular weight of the copolymer to surface morphology and WCA of the electrospun film were investigated by using scanning electron microscope, goniometer, atomic force microscope and nuclear magnetic resonance instruments. Experiments proved that deliberate incorporation of the beads into the film resulted in extreme <b>water-repellency.</b> It was found that, as the viscosity of the solution was decreased, the density of the polymeric beads, so the film roughness in three dimensions, was increased to more than 150 o WCA values for the electrospun films. In the molecular weight of copolymer study, electrospinning of lower molecular weight copolymer was generated solely bead morphology, which resulted the highest WCA of 166. 7 ± 2. 2 o with the lowest water sliding angle of 4. 3 ± 0. 8 o.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{radio-frequency}} powers on {{the properties of}} carbon coatings on optical fibers prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition is investigated. The radio-frequency powers are selected at 150, 200, 250, 300, and 350 W. Results indicate that if the radio-frequency power increases from 150 to 350 W, the deposition rate of carbon coatings and carbon grain size increase. As the radio-frequency power changes from 150 to 200 W, the water contact angle of carbon coatings increases due to the increase of sp(3) -CHx bonding. Alternatively, as the radio-frequency power increases from 200 to 350 W, the water contact angle of carbon coatings gradually reduces which is resulted from the increase of surface toughness. As the radio-frequency power is 200 W, the carbon coating has the highest <b>water-repellency</b> and the excellent ability to sustain the low-temperature loading, so {{it is the best}} for production of the hermetic optical fiber coating.

Additionally, base on the <b>water-repellency</b> and low-temperature surface morphology of the carbon coatings, the carbon coating that is deposited at a temperature of 715 ºC with coating thickness of 141 nm is the best for use as the hermetical optical fiber coating. 本研究是以熱化學氣相沉積法裂解乙炔製備碳密封鍍層光纖，並探討不同沉積溫度與鍍層厚度對碳鍍層性質之影響。本實驗利用X光光電子能譜儀、拉曼散射光譜儀、場發射掃描式電子顯微鏡、原子力顯微鏡、奈米壓痕器、光學顯微鏡等儀器，來觀察與量測碳鍍層化學鍵結、微觀結構、橫截面顯微組織、表面粗糙度、機械性質與表面形貌，並藉由抗水性與低溫環境試驗來評估碳鍍層光纖的密封性。 結果顯示，當沉積溫度由 700 上升到 740 ºC時，碳鍍層的沉積速率、表面粗糙度與表面顆粒的數目與大小會上升，平面間晶粒大小、水接觸角、硬度與楊氏模數均下降，結構趨向石墨化。在沉積溫度為 715 ºC，隨著鍍層厚度由 87 nm上升到 600 nm，碳結構趨向無序，平面間晶粒大小下降，水接觸角下降，化學鍵結保持不變。當鍍層厚度高於 141 nm，碳鍍層可以抵抗低溫環境的熱應力。 綜合實驗結果發現，沉積溫度為 715 ℃、鍍層厚度為 141 nm之碳鍍層光纖擁有較佳的抗水性、表面形貌、溫變抵抗能力，使得碳鍍層可達到對玻璃光纖保護之效果，為最佳的碳密封鍍層光纖。致謝	I 中文摘要	II 英文摘要	III 總目錄	V 圖目錄	VIII 表目錄	XI 第一章 緒論	 1 1. 1 	文獻回顧	 1 1. 1. 1 	光纖的發展	 1 1. 1. 2 	光纖的特性	 2 1. 1. 3 	光纖的基本結構	 3 1. 1. 4 	密封鍍層光纖	 5 1. 2 化學氣相沉積法	 9 1. 2. 1 	化學氣相沉積法的特色	 9 1. 2. 2 	化學氣相沉積法的沉積機構	 10 1. 2. 3 	沉積速率控制機構	 11 1. 3 研究動機	 12 1. 4 論文概要	 13 第二章 實驗步驟	 14 2. 1 試片前處理	 16 2. 2 碳密封鍍層光纖的製備	 18 2. 2. 1 熱化學氣相沉積系統	 18 2. 2. 2 實驗參數	 19 2. 2. 3 TCVD實驗流程	 20 2. 3 量測與分析	 22 2. 3. 1 微觀結構分析	 22 2. 3. 2 顯微組織觀察	 28 2. 3. 3 表面特性分析	 33 2. 3. 4 機械性質量測	 36 第三章 結果與討論	 40 3. 1 沉積溫度之影響	 40 3. 1. 1 微觀結構分析	 42 3. 1. 2 橫截面觀察與厚度量測	 48 3. 1. 3 表面特性分析	 52 3. 1. 4 機械性質分析	 57 3. 1. 5 低溫環境試驗	 58 3. 2 鍍層厚度之影響	 61 3. 2. 1 微觀結構分析	 61 3. 2. 2 沉積橫截面與厚度量測	 65 3. 2. 3 表面特性分析	 67 3. 2. 4 低溫環境試驗	 68 第四章 結論	 72 參考文獻	 75 作者簡介	 8...|$|E
40|$|Many plant {{surfaces}} are water-repellent {{because of a}} complex 3 -dimensional microstructure of the epider-mal cells (papillae) and a superimposed layer of hydrophobic wax crystals. Due to its surface tension, water does not spread on such surfaces but forms spherical droplets that lie only on {{the tips of the}} microstructures. Studying six species with heavily microstructured surfaces by a new type of confocal light microscopy, the number, height, and average distance of papillae per unit area were measured. These measurements were combined with those of an atomic force microscope which was used to measure the exposed area of the ®ne-structure on individual papillae. According to calculations based upon these measurements, roughening results in a reduction of the contact area of more than 95 % com-pared with the projected area of a water droplet. By applying water/methanol solutions of decreasing surface tension to a selection of 33 water-repellent species showing different types of surface struc-tures, the critical value at which wetting occurs was determined. The results impressively demonstrated the importance of roughening on different length scales for <b>water-repellency,</b> since extremely papillose surfaces, having an additional wax layer, are able to resist up to 70 % methanol. Surfaces that lack papillae or similar structures on the same length scale are much more easily wetted...|$|E
