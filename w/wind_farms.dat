5|$|Effects {{are not all}} negative; for example, <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> produce {{renewable}} energy, {{helping to}} mitigate the single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> are poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> benefit birds; poorly sited ones can kill many birds in collisions. For example, at the Altamont Pass in California, the golden eagle has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area. Thus, there is a trade-off in the siting of any wind farm.|$|E
5|$|Offshore {{wind power}} is {{captured}} by wind turbines placed out at sea; {{it has the}} advantage that wind speeds are higher than on land, though <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> are more costly to construct offshore.

5|$|Although the UK Government has set {{a target}} of 10% for the {{proportion}} of the UK's electricity produced by renewable energy by 2010, wind power in the UK {{has a long history of}} controversy, with an average approval rate for planning permission of only 28% for onshore <b>wind</b> <b>farms.</b> Scout Moor was first identified as an excellent site for a wind farm in 2001. Peel Holdings commissioned market research consultants MORI to undertake a telephone poll over seventeen days in 2002, soliciting the opinions of residents in Bury, Rossendale and Rochdale about <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> in general and Scout Moor in particular.

5|$|The Republic of Ireland {{has shown}} a strong {{commitment}} to renewable energy, ranking {{as one of the top}} 10 markets for cleantech investment in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index.

Large <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> are being constructed in coastal counties such as Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Antrim. The construction of <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities, some of whom overall consider the wind turbines to be unsightly.
