2500|$|During the 1930s, Welk led a {{traveling}} big band that specialized in dance tunes and [...] "sweet" [...] music (during this period, bands which played light, melodic music {{were referred to}} as [...] "sweet bands" [...] to distinguish them from the more rhythmic and assertive [...] "hot" [...] bands of artists like Benny Goodman and Duke Ellington). Initially, the band traveled around the country by car. They were too poor to rent rooms, so they usually slept and changed clothes in their cars. The term champagne music was derived from an engagement at the William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh, when a dancer referred to his band's sound as [...] "light and bubbly as champagne." [...] The hotel also lays claim to the original [...] "bubble machine," [...] a prop left over from a 1920s movie premiere. Welk described his band's sound, saying, [...] "We still play music with the champagne style, which means light and rhythmic. <b>We</b> <b>place</b> the stress on melody; the chords are played {{pretty much the way}} the composer wrote them. We play with a steady beat so that dancers can follow it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Respirometry {{depends on}} a [...] "what goes in must come out" [...] principle. Consider a closed system first. Imagine that <b>we</b> <b>place</b> a mouse into an {{air-tight}} container. The air sealed in the container initially contains the same composition and proportions of gases that {{were present in the}} room: 20.95% O2, 0.04% CO2, water vapor (the exact amount {{depends on a}}ir temperature, see dew point), 78% (approximately) N2, 0.93% argon and a variety of trace gases making up the rest (see Earth's atmosphere). As time passes, the mouse in the chamber produces CO2 and water vapor, but extracts O2 from the air in proportion to its metabolic demands. Therefore, as long as we know the volume of the system, the difference between the concentrations of O2 and CO2 at the start when we sealed the mouse into the chamber (the baseline or reference conditions) compared to the amounts present after the mouse has breathed the air at a later time must be the amounts of CO2/O2 produced/consumed by the mouse. Nitrogen and argon are inert gasses and therefore their fractional amounts are unchanged by the respiration of the mouse. In a closed system, the environment will eventually become hypoxic.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the custom}} of the times, Patterson filed a legal claim for the profits from the confiscated ships and merchandise. An {{attorney}} representing Lafitte argued that the captured ships had flown the flag of Cartagena, an area at peace with the United States. One of Lafitte's men testified that the Baratarians had never intended to fight the US but had prepared their vessels to flee. The judge ruled that Patterson should get the customary share of profits from the goods {{that had already been}} sold, but he did not settle the ownership of the ships. They were held in port under custody of the United States marshal. Likely inspired by Lafitte's offer to help defend Louisiana, Governor Claiborne wrote the US Attorney General, Richard Rush requesting a pardon for the Baratarians, saying that for generations, smugglers were [...] "esteemed honest ... sympathy for these offenders is certainly more or less felt by many of the Louisianans". According to Ramsay, Claiborne next wrote to General Andrew Jackson, [...] "implying Patterson had destroyed a potential first line of defense for Louisiana" [...] by his capture of Lafitte and his ships. Jackson responded, [...] "I ask you, Louisianans, can <b>we</b> <b>place</b> any confidence in the honor of men who have courted an alliance with pirates and robbers?" ...|$|E
