40|$|To reduce coastal {{flooding}} {{risks in}} several coastal towns in Belgium <b>wave</b> return <b>walls</b> {{on top of}} the existing seaside promenades are designed. The structural strength and foundation of the <b>wave</b> return <b>walls</b> have to be designed taking into account the hydrodynamic loading due to overtopping waves. Based on existing relations for layer thickness and layer speed of overtopping waves a semi-empirical formula is developed to deliver a design value for the hydrodynamic loading on a <b>wave</b> return <b>wall</b> for given geometric and hydraulic boundary conditions. Using experimental results of scale models in wave flumes the empirical parameters of the semi-empirical formula are to be calibrated and validated for the range of applicability representative for the configurations occurring along the Belgian coastline...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} study the wave {{overtopping}} process, this paper establishes a two-dimensional numerical wave flume based on a meshless algorithm, local method of approximate particular solution (the LMAPS method), and the technology of momentum source wave. It calculates the climbing and overtopping process under regular waves on a typical slope, results of which are more consistent with the physical model test results. Finally, wave action simulation is carried out on six different structural forms of wave walls (vertical <b>wave</b> <b>wall,</b> 1 / 4 arc <b>wave</b> <b>wall,</b> reversed-arc <b>wave</b> <b>wall,</b> smooth surface <b>wave</b> <b>wall</b> with 1 : 3 slope ratio, smooth surface <b>wave</b> <b>wall</b> with 1 : 1. 5 slope ratio and stepped surface <b>wave</b> <b>wall</b> with 1 : 1. 5 slope ratio).

40|$|Propagation of the {{magnetization}} <b>waves</b> along domain <b>walls</b> (2 D magnons) in a superconducting ferromagnet {{has been}} studied theoretically. The magnetostatic fields (long-range dipole-dipole interaction) have a crucial effect on the spectrum of 2 D magnons. But this effect is essentially affected by the superconducting Meissner currents, which screen the magnetostatic fields and modify the long-wavelength spectrum from square-root to linear. The excitation of the domain <b>wall</b> <b>waves</b> by an electromagnetic wave incident on a superconducting-ferromagnet sample has been considered. This suggests using measurements of the surface impedance for studying the domain <b>wall</b> <b>waves,</b> and eventually for effective probing of superconductivity-ferromagnetism coexistence.
