5|$|A nearby {{mountain}} {{was named}} Jabal ad-Dik ("Mount of the Rooster") {{because of a}} traditional story. According to the tradition, a Jew that lived in Jifna had visited Jerusalem during the Passion. Seeing Jesus rise from the dead, the man immediately converted and told his wife what he saw. His wife refused to believe him unless the rooster she had just killed <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> life. Instantly, the rooster flew away towards the mountain. The story was recited in some monasteries on Holy Thursday together with other biblical readings.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, a disembodied Oscar floats over Tokyo and {{witnesses}} {{the aftermath of}} his death. Linda becomes withdrawn and despondent, especially after getting an abortion; Oscar's dealer, Bruno, destroys his stash; Alex lives in hiding on the streets; and Linda wishes {{she would have been}} with Alex instead of Mario, as Oscar had wanted. On one occasion, Linda wishes that Oscar <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> life; Oscar then enters Linda's head, and experiences her dream in which he wakes up at the morgue, from which his body is taken to be cremated.|$|E

However, {{when first}} Shevardnadze, then Kazakh leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, turned it down, Gorbachev chose Gennady Yanayev, {{the head of}} the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and a known hardliner. This {{decision}} <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> haunt Gorbachev later.|$|E

It turned out that Tabinshwehti had decided to attack Prome right after the rainy season when no one expected him to. He secretly prepared for war throughout the rainy season (June to October) of 1541. Only King Minkhaung of Prome reinforced his city's defensive fortifications, and stockpiled supplies and provisions.|$|E
25|$|The town of Guildford {{has been}} home to several elite {{basketball}} teams down the years. With {{the opening of the}} Guildford Spectrum, the successful Kingston team uprooted, moved in and renamed themselves as the Guildford Kings in 1992, briefly calling the place home until they folded in 1994, as did the Guildford Pumas before they relocated to Sutton in 1999. However it was the first major team, the Guildford Pirates who played in the town from 1975 to 1982 that <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> figure prominently in the birth of the new club, the Guildford Heat.|$|E
25|$|Cleveland <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> win {{the next}} two games, Game 3, a blowout where five Cavs scored in double figures, and Game 4 where James would punctuate the victory with a dunk over Garnett. James's {{shooting}} improved in the return to the Garden in Game 5, but received minimal help from his teammates as Rajon Rondo, Garnett, and Paul Pierce all scored over 20 points to push Boston over the top. Game 6 was an ugly affair, with both teams shooting under 40 percent, but a 32–12–6 performance by James was enough. Boston, the best road team in the regular season, fell to 0–6 on the road.|$|E

25|$|In 230, Cao Rui {{promoted}} Man Chong to General Who Attacks the East (征東將軍). In {{the winter}} of that year, after receiving intelligence that the Wu emperor Sun Quan was planning to attack Hefei, Man Chong immediately requested for reinforcements from Yan and Yu provinces and stepped up the defences at Hefei. When Sun Quan heard about it, he called off the attack on Hefei. Man Chong knew that Sun Quan was only pretending to retreat to put him off guard, and <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> attack Hefei again once the reinforcements left. He was proven right as Sun Quan attacked Hefei after about 10 days. However, as Hefei was well-defended, Sun Quan's forces could not breach the walls and had to withdraw.|$|E
25|$|His near miracle comeback, {{combined}} with Simms' injury, {{earned him the}} starting position for his final game at Texas, the 2001 Holiday Bowl and he didn't disappoint. In perhaps his finest game, he led Texas from behind three times throwing for a school record 473 yards and four touchdowns. In a fourth quarter aerial assault, Texas scored 23 points in a little over 10 minutes to take the lead, but Washington <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> take the lead once more. With 1:49 left in the game, Applewhite engineered a 7 play, 80 yard touchdown drive with passes of 25 and 37 yards to win the game. He was named the Holiday Bowl MVP as a result. He finished with a record as a starter of 22-8.|$|E
25|$|The {{conquest of}} Cuba was {{organized}} in 1510 by the recently restored Viceroy of the Indies, Diego Colón, {{under the command}} of Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, who became Cuba's first governor until his death in 1524. The new settlers did not wish to be under the personal authority of Colón, so Velázquez founded the city of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Baracoa in 1511 and convoked a general cabildo (a local government council), which was duly authorized to deal directly with Spain. This legal move removed Velázquez and the settlers from under the authority of Colón, their nominal superior. It was a precedent that <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> haunt Velázquez during Hernán Cortés's conquest of Mexico. Other cities were later founded under Velázquez: Bayamo in 1513; Santísima Trinidad, Sancti Spíritus and San Cristóbal de La Habana in 1514; Puerto Príncipe and Santiago de Cuba in 1515. After the conquest of Mexico, Cuba experienced an exodus of settlers, and its population remained small for the next two centuries.|$|E

25|$|The {{role and}} {{authority}} of the ulema declined after the rise of King Faisal {{even though they had}} helped bring him to the throne in 1964. Despite his piety and biological relationship through his mother to the AlasShaykh family, and his support for the pan-Islamic movement in his struggle against pan-Arabism, he decreased the ulema's power and influence. Unlike his successor, King Faisal attempted to ensure that the most radical clerics did not hold society's most powerful religious posts. He tried to block extremist clerics from gaining dominion over religious institutions such as the Council of Senior Ulema, the kingdom's highest religious body, or rising to high religious positions such as Grand Mufti, a politically recognized senior expert charged with maintaining the entire system of Islamic law. Still, {{at least some of the}} king's advisers warned early on that, once religious zealots were encouraged, they <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> haunt the kingdom. King Faisal rejected the ulema's opposition to aspects of his accelerated modernization attempts, sometimes even in matters considered by them to be major issues.|$|E
25|$|One of the school's {{foremost}} specialities {{has always}} been the teaching of history, and as such it has produced a large number of renowned historians who have been important in the development of their subject, starting with Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, Ernest Lavisse and Jérôme Carcopino, all students of the school {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century who later <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> direct it. Around the turn of the century two men who would become the founders of the Annales School, Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre, studied at the school. Jacqueline de Romilly and Pierre Grimal, respectively historians of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, were both students at the school starting in 1933. Sinologist Marcel Granet, medievalist Jacques Le Goff, Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, archeologist Paul Veyne, Ancien Régime specialist Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie and Pre-Columbian civilisation anthropologist Jacques Soustelle were all students at the school, as well as Georges Dumézil, who revolutionised comparative philology and mythography with his analyses of sovereignty in Proto-Indo-European religion and formulated the trifunctional hypothesis of social class in ancient societies.|$|E
25|$|In Game One, the Lakers {{jumped out}} to an 18–5 lead, but the 76ers stormed back to take a 15-point lead in the second half. Los Angeles rallied to force a 94–94 tie {{at the end of}} {{regulation}} before scoring the first five points of the overtime period, but the 76ers closed the game on a 13–2 run for a 107–101 triumph. Iverson hit a go-ahead three-pointer with 1:19 to go in the extra period, and followed that with a jump shot after which he infamously stepped over Tyronn Lue after making the basket. Eric Snow hit a running jump shot in the waning seconds with the shot clock expiring to clinch the stunning victory. The series <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Philadelphia even as Los Angeles took Game Two, 98–89. In Game Three, Shaquille O'Neal fouled out late in the fourth quarter, and the Sixers pulled to within a point with less than a minute to play after trailing by 12 earlier in the second half. Robert Horry, however, hit a clutch three-pointer in that final minute, and the Lakers prevailed, 96–91. Los Angeles wrapped up the second of what would be three consecutive NBA titles with a 100–86 win in Game Four and a 108–96 victory in Game Five.|$|E

25|$|During this time, the Anglican Church assumed {{de facto}} {{administrative}} {{responsibility in the}} far-flung wilderness of Canada and British North America. The church contracted with colonial officials and later the federal Crown to administer residential schools for the indigenous peoples of the First Nations – a decision which <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> haunt it much later. Such schools removed children from their home communities in an attempt to, among other things, assimilate them into the dominant European culture and language: the merits and demerits of that system in a broad sense, such as they were, have latterly been entirely overwhelmed by {{the issue of the}} wholly reprehensible abuse of some of its child wards by sexually disordered mission personnel. At the same time, Anglican missionaries were involved in advocating for First Nations rights and land claims on behalf of those people to whom they were ministering (for example, the Nisga'a of northern British Columbia). One of the earliest First Nations students to be educated at Red River in the 1830s was Henry Budd. He was ordained in 1850 and was the first First Nations priest and became the missionary at Fort Cumberland on the Saskatchewan River and then to the post of The Pas. The Anglican Church of Canada's Prayer Book commemorates Henry Budd on 2 April.|$|E
500|$|In 1590, Lopez {{approached}} Mendoza, possibly on Walsingham's behalf, {{with the}} intention of opening peace negotiations. The Spanish gave [...] Manuel de Andrada, Lopez's intermediary, a jewelled ring worth £100 as a gift for Lopez's daughter. After Walsingham's death in 1591, Lopez continued exchanging letters with Spanish officials without the English government's knowledge or authority. There is no surviving evidence to suggest that Lopez conspired against England or Elizabeth personally, but these Spanish connections <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> punish him—according to Samuel, [...] "Lopez had acted stupidly and dishonestly".|$|E

[...] Mitchell accepted this offer and announced that he would not seek re-election to Parliament on grounds that he “…could not afford to be an MP” — a statement that <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> haunt him. He left Parliament {{at the time of the}} February 1974 general election, very much against the advice of both his wife Sue and fellow maverick MP Tam Dalyell.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the crisis, Kerr did {{not tell}} Whitlam of his {{increasing}} concerns, nor did he suggest that he might dismiss Whitlam. He believed nothing he said would influence Whitlam, and feared that, if Whitlam perceived him as a possible opponent, the Prime Minister would procure his dismissal from the Queen. Accordingly, though Kerr dealt with Whitlam in an affable manner, he did not confide his thinking to the Prime Minister. Labor Senator Tony Mulvihill later related that [...] "Whitlam <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> each caucus meeting and say, 'I saw His Excellency... No worry. He's {{got to do it}} his way.'... at no time did he hint that the Governor-General was frowning." ...|$|E
500|$|Truman {{decided that}} he did not need formal {{authorization}} from Congress, believing that most legislators supported his position; this <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> haunt him later, when the stalemated conflict was dubbed [...] "Mr. Truman's War" [...] by legislators. However, on July 3, 1950, Truman did give Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas a draft resolution titled [...] "Joint Resolution Expressing Approval of the Action Taken in Korea". Lucas said that Congress supported the use of force, that the formal resolution would pass but was unnecessary, and that the consensus in Congress was to acquiesce. Truman responded {{that he did not}} want [...] "to appear to be trying to get around Congress and use extra-Constitutional powers," [...] and added that it was [...] "up to Congress whether such a resolution should be introduced." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{editorial}} position <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> haunt Stone. Also in 1870, Elizabeth Roberts Tilton {{told her}} husband Theodore Tilton {{that she had been}} carrying on an adulterous relation with his good friend Henry Ward Beecher. Theodore Tilton published an editorial saying that Beecher [...] "has at a most unseemly time of life been detected in improper intimacies with certain ladies of his congregation." [...] Tilton also informed Stanton about the alleged affair, and Stanton passed the information to Victoria Woodhull. Woodhull, a free love advocate, printed innuendo about Beecher, and began to woo Tilton, convincing him to write a book of her life story from imaginative material that she supplied. In 1871, Stone wrote to a friend [...] "my one wish in regard to Mrs. Woodhull is, that [...] she nor her ideas, may be so much as heard of at our meeting." [...] Woodhull's self-serving activities were attracting disapproval from both centrist AWSA and radical NWSA. To divert criticism from herself, Woodhull published a denunciation of Beecher in 1872 saying that he practiced free love in private while speaking out against it from the pulpit. This caused a sensation in the press, and resulted in an inconclusive legal suit and a subsequent formal inquiry lasting well into 1875. The furor over adultery and the friction between various camps of women's rights activists took focus away from legitimate political aims. Harry Blackwell wrote to Stone from Michigan where he was working toward putting woman suffrage into the state constitution, saying [...] "This Beecher-Tilton affair is playing the deuce with [...] in Michigan. No chance of success this year I fancy." ...|$|E
