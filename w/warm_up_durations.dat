The results are then validated using a dynamic programming approach on a high fidelity engine model, and compared experimentally with a production calibration for an inline 6 -cylinder, SI gasoline engine. The methodology used can be readily extended to other mixed objective problems, and can be a useful tool in decreasing engine calibration time. 1...|$|R
30|$|This section {{describes}} the test protocol adopted during simulator validation in the 2 BeSafe project. Before the test, the experimenter informs the participant on {{the framework of}} the project and of the aim of the experiment. In particular, the participant is informed that it is a test of the simulator and not a test of the rider. The test starts with the warm-up phase, followed by the evaluation one. The <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> phase aims to make the participant confident with the simulator commands: handlebar, brakes and clutch. During this phase the experimenter will ask the participant to perform some simple, specific task on a (virtual) free space. The <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> <b>duration</b> is approximately 8 – 10  min. The evaluation phase duration is approximately 15 – 20  min of driving in rural and urban environments. Each participant fills in the participant profile questionnaire. During the test the experimenter continuously assists the participant.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} {{the importance of}} the duration and intensity of "warm up" exercise for reducing ischaemia during second exercise in patients with exertional angina.  DESIGN—Randomised crossover comparison of three <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> exercise protocols.  PATIENTS— 18 subjects with stable ischaemic heart disease and >  0. 1 mV ST segment depression on treadmill exercise testing.  INTERVENTIONS—The <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> protocols were 20  minutes of slow exercise at 2. 7  km/h, symptom limited graded exercise for a mean of 7. 4  (range 5. 0  to 10. 5) minutes, and three minutes of symptom limited fast exercise of similar maximum intensity.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—ST segment depression during graded treadmill exercise undertaken 10  minutes after each <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> protocol or no <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> exercise.  RESULTS—Compared with exercise with no <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> the <b>duration</b> of graded exercise after earlier slow <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> increased by 4. 9 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), − 3. 3 % to 13. 7 %), after graded <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 10. 3 % (95 % CI, 5. 6 % to 15. 2 %), and after fast <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 16 % (95 % CI, 6. 2 % to 26. 7 %). ST segment depression at equivalent submaximal exercise decreased after slow <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 27 % (95 % CI, 5 % to 44 %), after graded <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 31 % (95 % CI, 17 % to 44 %), and after fast <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> by 47 % (95 % CI, 27 % to 61 %). Compared with slow <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> exercise, the more intense graded and fast <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> protocols significantly increased the duration of second exercise (p =  0. 0072) and reduced both peak ST depression (p =  0. 0026) and the rate of increase of ST depression (p =  0. 0069).  CONCLUSIONS—In patients with exertional angina the size of the <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> response is related to the maximum intensity rather than the duration of first exercise.    Keywords: exercise; angina; warm up; preconditionin...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: A <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> is {{undertaken}} before exercise {{to prepare the}} body for performance, reduce injury and improve performance[1]. Despite evidence suggesting that low intensity static-based <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> are detrimental to performance[2] they are often included in pre-game <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> routines. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether a dynamic-based <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> of shorter <b>duration</b> and higher intensity (DSH) was more effective at preparing elite rugby league players for performance than a <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> that included combined static and dynamic activities of longer duration and lower intensity (Cll). It was hypothesised that the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> would be superior to the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> with respect to physical performance measures and player perceptions of readiness to perform. Methods: Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects with testing approved by the JCU research Ethics committee. Elite rugby league players (n= 28) completed the DSH and Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> routines in random order, separated by 7 days. Following each <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> players completed vertical jump and 40 m sprint. Player and coach perceptions of the <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> and readiness to play or train were determined by questionnaires and interviews. Paired samples T -tests were used to identify significant differences between <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> (p < 0. 05). Results: Players reported no significant differences between <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> for preparedness to perform vertical jump (DSH: 6. 3 ± 1. 3 vs Cll: 6. 0 ± 1. 0, P = 0. 25) or 40 m sprint (DSH: 6. 3 ± 1. 8 vs Cll: 6. 3 ± 1. 7, P = 0. 917). Senior players and coaching staff rated the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> as significantly better than the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> (DSH: 7. 6 ± 1. 3 vs Cll: 6. 0 ± 1. 1, P = 0. 019) after using the DSH <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> in three preseason trial games. ConclusionlDiscussion: The dynamic <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> resulted in significantly faster 40 m sprint times and higher perception of readiness to perform in games compared to the combined <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> The vertical jump result of no difference between <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> contrasted available research[3] however this may be due to the dynamic component of the Cll <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> mitigating the detrimental effects of the static component[4].

40|$|Despite limited {{scientific}} evidence supporting their effectiveness, warm-up routines prior to exercise are a well-accepted practice. The {{majority of the}} effects of <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> have been attributed to temperature-related mechanisms (e. g. decreased stiffness, increased nerve-conduction rate, altered force-velocity relationship, increased anaerobic energy provision and increased thermoregulatory strain), although non-temperature-related mechanisms have also been proposed (e. g. effects of acidaemia, elevation of baseline oxygen consumption (V̇O 2) and increased postactivation potentiation). It has also been hypothesised that <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> may have a number of psychological effects (e. g. increased preparedness). Warm-up techniques can be broadly classified into two major categories: passive <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> or active <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> Passive <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> involves raising muscle or core temperature by some external means, while active <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> utilises exercise. Passive heating allows one to obtain the increase in muscle or core temperature achieved by active <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> without depleting energy substrates. Passive <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> although not practical for most athletes, also allows one to test the hypothesis that many of the performance changes associated with active <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> can be largely attributed to temperature-related mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Lack {{of benefit}} of <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> on {{prolonged}} intermittent-sprint performance {{has been proposed}} {{to be due to}} use of a pacing strategy by participants. To investigate this, twelve participants performed four cycle trials that consisted of either prolonged intermittent-sprint performance (80 min) or single-sprint performance (4 s), with or without a <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> The first-sprint ofintermittent-sprint performance was also assessed. No interaction effects (P > 0. 05) were found between trials for intermittent-sprint performance for total work (J · kg− 1), or percentage work and power decrement. Work done during the first-sprint of intermittent-sprint performance (no <b>warm</b> <b>up)</b> was less (P < 0. 001) than the first-sprint of intermittent-sprint performance (warm up; effect size (ES) = 0. 59) and both single-sprint trials (<b>warm</b> <b>up</b> and no <b>warm</b> up; ES = 0. 91, 0. 75, respectively).

40|$|<b>Warming</b> <b>up</b> is {{a widely}} {{accepted}} procedure preceding every type of athletic events, although objective evidence supporting the use of <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> is limited. Coaches, physical educators and athletes of almost every athletic activity assume that the warming-up procedure is a mean by which athletic performance may be improved, and the chance of injury reduced; they also hold {{that the benefits of}} <b>warming</b> <b>up</b> have been attributed to an increased range of motion in the joints, increased circulation, decreased viscosity, increased body and muscle temperature and neural facilitation (24) and that <b>warming</b> <b>up</b> has an inherent psychological effect since it helps the athlete to achieve a state of mental readiness or mind set. However, some athletes and coaches are inclined to question the value of warm-up activity on the basis that the athlete may have already exhausted a needed part of his energy when the time comes for the major performance. The value of <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> prior to an athletic event was not questioned until 1945 when Asmussen and Boje studied the role of increased body and muscle temperature on muscular performance. Within the past decade and still today the principle of <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> is the subject of considerable debate and it has gained favour as a topic for research among serious researchers in the physiology of exercise. Numerous studies have investigated the effect of various warm-up procedures on muscular performance in an activity; also certain changes in the physiological phenomena such as heart rate and oxygen consumption have been used as specific <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> as well as attitude toward <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> have been studied as they affect physical performance (7). The evidence presented by the above research has not been conclusive with a few studies reporting that <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> has no beneficial effect on performance' and in fact may even hinder it, while others have reported that <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> is neither beneficial nor harmful. The majority of the research however has reported that <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> prior to an athletic event is beneficial to performance (7). It is becoming apparent then that there is no one answer to the question and that factors such as the type of the activity, the nature of the warm-up, the extent and intensity of the warm-up, the physiological make-up of the individual and the attitude toward <b>warming</b> <b>up</b> must all be considered. If the results of the research in our field seem to be controversial at this time, that probably {{is due to the fact}} that each study has tried to find the answer to the question from a different point of view with different factors involved (24) ...|$|R

40|$|While <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> is {{considered}} to be essential for optimum performance, there is little scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness in many situations. As a result, warm-up procedures are usually based on the trial and error experience of the athlete or coach, rather than on scientific study. Summarising the findings of the many warm-up studies conducted over the years is difficult. Many of the earlier studies were poorly controlled, contained few study participants and often omitted statistical analyses. Furthermore, over the years, <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> protocols consisting of different types (e. g. active, passive, specific) and structures (e. g. varied intensity, duration and recovery) have been used. Finally, while many studies have investigated the physiological responses to <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> relatively few studies have reported changes in performance following <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> The first part of this review critically analyses reported changes in performance following various active warm-up protocols. While there is a scarcity of well-controlled studies with large subject numbers and appropriate statistical analyses, a number of conclusions can be drawn regarding the effects of active <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> on performance. Active <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> tends to result in slightly larger improvements in short-term performance (10 seconds, but < 5 minutes) if it allows the athlete to begin the subsequent task in a relatively non-fatigued state, but with an elevated baseline oxygen consumption (V̇O 2). While active <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> has been reported to improve endurance performance, it may have a detrimental effect on endurance performance if it causes a significant increase in thermoregulatory strain. The addition of a brief, task-specific burst of activity has been reported to provide further ergogenic benefits for some tasks. By manipulating intensity, duration and recovery, many different warm-up protocols may be able to achieve similar physiological and performance changes. Finally, passive warm-up techniques may be important to supplement or maintain temperature increases produced by an active <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> especially if there is an unavoidable delay between the <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> and the task and/or the weather is cold. Further research is required to investigate the role of <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> in different environmental conditions, especially for endurance events where a critical core temperature may limit performance...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} warm-up intensity on all-out sprint cycling performance, muscle oxygenation and metabolism, 8 trained male cyclists/triathletes undertook a 30 -s sprint cycling test preceded by moderate, heavy or severe <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> and 10 -min recovery. Muscle oxygenation was measured by near-infrared spectroscopy, with deoxyhaemoglobin ([HHb]) during the sprint analysed with monoexponential models with time delay. Aerobic, anaerobic-glycolytic and phosphocreatine energy provision to the sprint were estimated from oxygen uptake and lactate production. Immediately prior to the sprint, blood [lactate] was different for each <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> and higher than resting for the heavy and severe <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> (mod. 0. 94 ± 0. 36, heavy 1. 92 ± 0. 64, severe 4. 37 ± 0. 93 mmol l - 1 P < 0. 05), although muscle oxygenation was equally raised above rest. Mean power during the sprint was lower following severe compared to moderate <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> (mod. 672 ± 54, heavy 666 ± 56, severe 655 ± 59 W, P < 0. 05). The [HHb] kinetics during the sprint were not different among conditions, although the time delay before [HHb] increased was shorter for severe versus moderate <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> (mod. 5. 8 ± 0. 6, heavy 5. 6 ± 0. 9, severe 5. 2 ± 0. 7 s, P < 0. 05). The severe <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> was without effect on estimated aerobic metabolism, but increased estimated phosphocreatine hydrolysis, the latter unable {{to compensate for the}} reduction in estimated anaerobic-glycolytic metabolism.

5000|$|A <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> {{generally}} {{consists of}} a gradual increase in intensity in physical activity (a [...] "pulse raiser"), joint mobility exercise, and stretching, followed by the activity. <b>Warming</b> <b>up</b> brings the body to a condition at which it safely responds to nerve signals for quick and efficient action.|$|R
50|$|This junior process ends {{when the}} first {{children}} grow old enough to graduate from the Under 18's and are promoted to the Senior team, no longer kicking a ball around as they <b>warm</b> <b>up,</b> rather <b>warming</b> <b>up</b> {{shoulder to shoulder with}} the seniors, all like one big family.|$|R
50|$|For example, before {{running or}} playing an {{intensive}} sport, the athlete might slowly jog to warm their muscles and increase their heart rate. It {{is important that}} <b>warm</b> <b>ups</b> be specific to the activity, so that the muscles to be used are activated. The {{risks and benefits of}} combining stretching with <b>warming</b> <b>up</b> are dispute, although it is generally believed that <b>warming</b> <b>up</b> prepares the athlete both mentally and physically. In a meta-study of 32 high quality studies, about 4/5 ths of the studies showed improvements in performance.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Warm</b> <b>up</b> {{sets are}} also important. For example, the same lifter {{working on his}} chest would also be advised to {{complete}} at least two <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> sets prior to hitting his [...] "core tonnage." [...] Core tonnage refers to the heavier lifts that actually strain your muscles. For example, if the lifter's main sets were at 205 lbs, 225 lbs and 235 lbs on the bench, then a warmup of 5 reps of 135 and 5 reps of 185 would be advisable. Some lifters will <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> with a 50/50 set for example 50% of the target weight for 50% of the target repetitions. When properly <b>warmed</b> <b>up</b> the lifter will then have more strength and stamina since the blood has begun to flow to the muscle groups.|$|R

The study reveals that a based ballast (CS-PPRI) {{complies with the}} automotive requirement of very fast <b>warm</b> <b>up.</b> The experimental ballast was run under Zero Voltage Switching (ZVS) at a nominal switching frequency of 1. 29 MHz while the pre-ignition switching frequency was 124 KHz. <b>Warm</b> <b>up</b> time to 80 % after cold ignition was about 10 seconds. the nominal power. However, since the lamp voltage during <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> is low (about 20 V), the current drive during <b>warm</b> <b>up</b> should reach about 7 - 8 time the nominal current, i. e. about 3 - 4 A.
