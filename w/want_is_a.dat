500|$|He was a {{part-time}} leg break bowler, taking 57wickets in first-class cricket at a useful average of 32.21. Barnes's leg break spun very little, {{but he had}} a topspinner which hurried onto the batsman and yielded him many wickets. Barnes was also a substitute wicket-keeper and a versatile fieldsman. During his career, he was noted for his disaffection for cricket administrators and umpires. On the 1948 tour of England, after an Australian appeal was turned down by umpire Alec Skelding, he grabbed a stray dog and presented it to Skelding, stating: [...] "Now all you <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> white stick". A complex character, Barnes, [...] "rarely forgave a slight or forgot a good turn. Stocky, with blue eyes and powerful wrists, he had a passion for physical fitness, and was an enthusiastic big-game fisherman and golfer".|$|E
500|$|Barnes {{returned}} for the subsequent fixture against Surrey at The Oval in London, where Australia won the toss and batted first. Barnes attacked immediately, {{and put on}} an opening partnership of 136 with Morris, before the latter fell. Bradman and Barnes put on another 207 for the second wicket before Barnes fell for 176. The tourists continued {{to build on the}} foundation laid by the top order and were eventually bowled out for 632. Bradman’s bowlers dismissed Surrey for 141 and 195 to win by an innings after enforcing the follow on. During the match, Barnes was involved in an oft-recalled incident. After a series of Australian appeals had been turned down in the match against Leicestershire by umpire Alec Skelding, Barnes had remonstrated with him and told him he had problems with his eyesight. Barnes also complained about Skelding adjudging him lbw, saying the ball [...] "wouldn't have hit another set of stumps" [...] and telling the umpire to get a guide dog. A stray dog ran onto the field during the Surrey game. It caused a stoppage in play by evading the players and police for a few minutes. Eventually, Barnes used the ball to bait and trap the dog, which he then [...] presented to Skelding stating: [...] "You must need a dog. You're blind when you give those decisions [...] not out" [...] and [...] "Now all you <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> white stick". Skelding refused the offer, and after Barnes continued to pressure him into taking the dog, he called for an adjournment and left the playing arena. Barnes later wrote [...] "Strange how I suggested he find himself a canine companion at ...|$|E
500|$|A new league, the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA), {{was formed}} in late November 1909. One of the teams, the All-Montreal Hockey Club, hired Ross as a playing-manager, but the league only lasted to mid-January 1910 before disbanding. Ross, who scored four goals in four games in the CHA, then signed with the Haileybury Comets of the National Hockey Association (NHA), a league formed in December 1909, which {{proved to be the}} {{stronger}} replacement to the ECAHA as the highest level of hockey in Canada. He received $2,700 to play in the 1910 season, which lasted from January to March, playing twelve games for the team and finishing with six goals. Before the following season, the NHA imposed a salary cap of $5,000 per team. The players, including Ross, were unhappy as this would result in a pay decrease, and began looking to form their own league without a cap. Ross wrote to the Montreal Herald, stating [...] "all the players <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fair deal ... The players are not trying to bulldoze the NHA, but we want to know where we get off at." [...] The plans were abandoned when they realized all the suitable arenas would be unavailable as they were owned or leased by the NHA. Ross scored four goals in eleven games with the Wanderers, who finished fourth in the five team league. During a match against the Quebec Bulldogs on February 25, 1911, Ross knocked out Eddie Oatman in a fight, provoking a massive brawl between the two teams, which the police had to break up. The fight helped to increase the reputation Ross had as a tough player unwilling to back down from any opponent. The following season Ross had eleven goals in nineteen games as the Wanderers improved to second in the league.|$|E

[...] Sleeth said [...] "The customers were saying, 'Everywhere I go, there you are,' and not in a good way. We were pretty ubiquitous."

According to David J. Lieberman, PhD, in Never Be Lied to Again: How to Get the Truth in Five Minutes or Less in Any Conversation or Situation, these methods can be learned. Some methods of questioning {{may be more likely}} to elicit the truth, for instance: [...] "When was the last time you smoked marijuana?"

2500|$|Jazani {{would explain}} that a revolutionary status {{does not exist}} in the country and in {{addition}} to that a revolution does not result from armed struggle rather it comes about as a development of a political, social, economical, and ideological process. A military uprising should be staged at the time of- and not before the revolution, as it does not cause a revolution by itself. In his opinion, those who are for a military uprising are similar to the Shah who is blocking a peaceful means of struggle. Because of this without talking about Ahmadzadeh, Jazani writes [...] "When we hear that revolution begins with a military uprising, we {{have to say that the}} believers of this train of thought do not know two things: one the current situation of military uprising and second revolution in general and the revolution we <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> specific one." ...|$|E

The filmmakers had asked Sting to perform the song for the film, though Sting declined telling them that he was too old to sing it and that they should find someone younger and hipper.

2500|$|The New Zealand Division {{was formed}} in March 1916, with Russell {{division}}al commander, and was sent to France the next month. With scant preparation, the division became operational in May 1916 in the Armentières sector of the Western Front. Soon it was involved in supporting the Somme Offensive, exposing problems and straining the men as extensive raids and patrols were carried out. Russell pushed for improvement, his goal being to create the best division in France. He inspected units daily and regularly visited the front line. Russell was a strict disciplinarian, and cracked down on high levels of desertion by recommending {{the death penalty for}} those found guilty of it. However, only five deserters were eventually executed and all were given posthumous pardons in 2000. Russell's insistence on rigid discipline was balanced by intensive training and tempered by close attention to the welfare of the troops under his command. In a letter to James Allen, the New Zealand Minister of Defence, Russell wrote: [...] "What we <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> platoon officer who will look after his men exactly as a mother does her boy of 10".|$|E

He started the 4/9 favourite against four opponents headed by The Grey Gatsby, with the other runners being Cougar Mountain (third in the Queen Anne Stakes), Western Hymn (Prix Eugene Adam, Gordon Richards Stakes, Brigadier Gerard Stakes) and Tullius (Sandown Mile). With no recognised front-runner in the race, Frankie Dettori had admitted that: [...] "There is a possibility we could make the running if no-one else wants to. Otherwise we will sit off it. Golden Horn is very versatile but what we don’t <b>want</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> messy race. He is a Derby winner not a sprinter". Gosden was not overly enthusiastic about the colt's chances saying [...] "I {{have a lot of respect}} for The Grey Gatsby... these are top older horses we’re taking on... any horse can get beaten" [...] and described the horse's position as odds-on favourite as [...] "a bit unusual". As in the Derby, Dettori had a [...] "lucky" [...] piece of kit: the left boot he had worn at Epsom had been ripped at Royal Ascot, but the jockey insisted on having it repaired by his valet and wore it at Sandown.|$|E
