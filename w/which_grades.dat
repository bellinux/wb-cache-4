5|$|About fifty {{grades of}} {{titanium}} and titanium alloys are designed and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of <b>which</b> <b>Grades</b> 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in tensile strength as a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E

25|$|Many scales {{have been}} {{developed}} to determine the degree of deformity in the chest wall. Most of these are variants on the distance between the sternum and the spine. One such index is the Backer ratio <b>which</b> <b>grades</b> severity of deformity based on the ratio between the diameter of the vertebral body nearest to xiphosternal junction and the distance between the xiphosternal junction and the nearest vertebral body. More recently the Haller index has been used based on CT scan measurements. An index over 3.25 is often defined as severe. The Haller index is the ratio between the horizontal distance of the inside of the ribcage and the shortest distance between the vertebrae and sternum.|$|E
25|$|Jung drew {{an analogy}} between the psyche and {{light on the}} {{electromagnetic}} spectrum. The center of the visible light spectrum (i.e., yellow) corresponds to consciousness, <b>which</b> <b>grades</b> into unconsciousnessness at the red and blue ends. Red corresponds to basic unconscious urges, and the invisible infra-red {{end of the spectrum}} corresponds to the influence of biological instinct, which merges with its chemical and physical conditions. The blue end of the spectrum represents spiritual ideas; and the archetypes, exerting their influence from beyond the visible, correspond to the invisible realm of ultra-violet. Jung suggested that not only do the archetypal structures govern the behavior of all living organisms, but that they were contiguous with structures controlling the behavior of inorganic matter as well.|$|E
40|$|AbstractLet A be a Noetherian ring <b>which</b> is <b>graded</b> by a finitely {{generated}} Abelian group G.

This {{is quite different from}} the case of gradings by torsion free group, for <b>which</b> <b>graded</b> primary decompositions always exists. In this paper we introduce G-primary decompositions as a natural analogue to primary decomposition for G-graded A-modules. We show the existence of G-primary decomposition and give a few characterizations analogous to Bourbaki's treatment for torsion free groups...|$|R
