Upon trading for Ballard, Florida head coach Jacques Martin heralded him as the club's number-two defenseman, behind Jay Bouwmeester. Prior to the 2008–09 season, Ballard signed a six-year, $25.2 million contract extension with the Panthers. The deal came with a season remaining on his existing contract, previously signed with the Coyotes.|$|E
5|$|Homosexuals were {{portrayed in}} such pre-Code films as Our Betters (1933), Footlight Parade (1933), Only Yesterday (1933), Sailor's Luck (1933), and Cavalcade (1933). Although the topic <b>was</b> <b>dealt</b> {{with much more}} openly than in the decades that followed, the {{characterizations}} {{of gay and lesbian}} characters were usually derogatory. Gay male characters were portrayed as flighty with high voices, existing merely as buffoonish supporting characters.|$|E

5|$|After {{a two-year}} junior {{career in the}} United States Hockey League (USHL), he was {{selected}} by the Bruins 179th overall in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. Following the draft, he joined the college ranks with the Boston College Eagles of the Hockey East conference. In four seasons with the Eagles, Alberts was named Hockey East's Best Defensive Defenseman and was a two-time NCAA All-American. Joining the Bruins in 2005, he played three seasons with the club before being traded to the Flyers. He played with the Flyers for one year, then with the Hurricanes in 2009. At the trade deadline the following year, he <b>was</b> <b>dealt</b> to the Canucks. Internationally, Alberts has competed for the American national team at the 2006 and 2007 World Championships.|$|E

5|$|Becoming an {{unrestricted}} free {{agent in the}} off-season, Alberts signed a two-year deal with the Carolina Hurricanes on July 16, 2009. The contract paid him $800,000 {{the first year and}} $1.3 million the second. After appearing in 62 games for Carolina, he <b>was</b> <b>dealt</b> at the 2009–10 trade deadline on March 3, 2010, to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for a third round pick in the 2010 draft (Austin Levi). Between Carolina and Vancouver, Alberts finished the regular season with 3 goals and 12 points over 76 games. His defensive play struggled in his initial stint with Vancouver, often being made a healthy scratch. He continued to earn criticism from Vancouver fans and media in the playoffs, particularly for his lack of speed and for taking costly penalties.|$|E
5|$|Brulé was {{selected}} first {{overall in the}} 2002 WHL Bantam Draft by the Vancouver Giants. The selection was originally possessed by the Prince Albert Raiders, but <b>was</b> <b>dealt</b> to the Giants {{in exchange for their}} third overall and third round selections. He debuted in one game with the Giants during the subsequent WHL season, while playing Junior A in the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL) with the Quesnel Millionaires. Recording 57points (32goals and 25assists) over 48games in his lone BCHL season, he was named the Interior Conference's recipient of the Bruce Allison Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year.|$|E
5|$|Cammalleri was {{involved}} in trade rumours following his arbitration hearing, which was considered contentious. At the 2008 NHL Entry Draft held on June 20, he <b>was</b> <b>dealt</b> to the Calgary Flames {{as part of a}} three-way trade. The Kings received Anaheim's first round pick, 12th overall, and a second round pick from Calgary, while the Ducks received Calgary's first round pick, 17th overall, and Los Angeles' 28th overall selection. Paired with Jarome Iginla, Cammalleri had a career year with the Flames in 2008–09, leading the team with 39 goals and finishing second to Iginla with 82 points. He scored the 100th goal of his career as part of his first hat trick early in a 4–3 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on November 27, 2008.|$|E

5|$|Four days later, Roy <b>was</b> <b>dealt</b> to the Colorado Avalanche with Mike Keane in {{exchange}} for Jocelyn Thibault, Martin Rucinsky and Andrei Kovalenko. The deal vaulted the Avalanche, the former Nordiques, to the 1996 Stanley Cup. Roy won another title with the Avalanche in 2001 along with a third Conn Smythe Trophy before retiring in 2003 with more wins than any NHL goaltender. The Canadiens, meanwhile, fell into an extended stretch of mediocrity, missing the playoffs in four of their next ten seasons and failing to advance past {{the second round of}} the playoffs until 2010. The team's lack of playoff success brought an end to its streak of winning a Stanley Cup in each decade from the 1910s to the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Wong <b>was</b> <b>dealt</b> {{the most}} severe {{disappointment}} of her career, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer refused to consider her for the leading role of the Chinese character O-Lan in {{the film version of}} Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth, choosing instead the white actress Luise Rainer to play the leading role. Wong spent the next year touring China, visiting her family's ancestral village and studying Chinese culture. In the late 1930s, she starred in several B movies for Paramount Pictures, portraying Chinese, and Chinese Americans in a positive light. She paid less attention to her film career during World War II, when she devoted her time and money to helping the Chinese cause against Japan. Wong returned to the public eye in the 1950s in several television appearances.|$|E
5|$|In February 2001, he was {{acquired}} by the Canucks. Cloutier enjoyed his most successful years as an NHL goaltender with Vancouver, recording three consecutive 30-win seasons between 2001–02 and 2003–04. In the 2006 off-season, he <b>was</b> <b>dealt</b> to Los Angeles, where he struggled with injuries {{and a decline in}} play. His contract was bought out by the team following the 2007–08 season. As part of an attempted comeback in 2009, he first signed a deal to try out with the Detroit Red Wings at the team's training camp, then played briefly with the AHL's Rockford IceHogs, before retiring due to chronic injury problems. Internationally, Cloutier was part of two Canadian teams. He won a gold medal at the 1995 World Junior Championship and was a fourth-string goaltender at the 2001 IIHF World Championship.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} year of his {{contract}} with Pittsburgh, he was the subject of trade rumours. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette listed the Edmonton Oilers as the most likely candidate to deal for Näslund. However, on 20 March 1996, he <b>was</b> <b>dealt</b> to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for forward Alek Stojanov. The deal would be {{regarded as one of the}} most lopsided trades in NHL history once Näslund displayed his full offensive capabilities later in his career. Stojanov, who had been drafted eight spots ahead of Näslund in the 1991 Draft, went on to play 45 games, scoring two goals and four assists for the Penguins over the next two seasons. He became a career minor-leaguer and retired by age 29, while Näslund would eventually play 884 games with the Canucks in 12 seasons.|$|E
5|$|Injury {{troubles}} {{continued the}} following season, in 2000–01, as Cloutier was sidelined for nine games {{early in the}} season after straining his biceps on October 22, 2000. After recovering, he recorded his first NHL shutout, making 26 saves, in a 3–0 win against the Detroit Red Wings on December 2, 2000. He achieved the feat in his 95th career game in the NHL. During that month, head coach Steve Ludzik began playing backup Kevin Weekes in favour of Cloutier. By the trade deadline, Cloutier <b>was</b> <b>dealt</b> to the Vancouver Canucks on February 7, 2001, in exchange for defenceman Adrian Aucoin and a second-round selection in the 2001 draft.|$|E
5|$|Minutes {{before the}} NHL trade {{deadline}} on February 27, 2012, Hodgson <b>was</b> <b>dealt,</b> along with defenceman Alexander Sulzer, to the Buffalo Sabres {{in exchange for}} fellow rookie forward Zack Kassian and defenceman Marc-André Gragnani. Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis acknowledged the trade {{as an effort to}} balance his team out by trading Hodgson's skill and finesse in return for Kassian's size and toughness. Analysts from TSN and The Vancouver Sun also echoed the sentiment, commenting that while the Canucks gained elements in Kassian that were required to succeed in the playoffs, Hodgson's skill set reflected the style of play that Vancouver's success was based upon.|$|E
