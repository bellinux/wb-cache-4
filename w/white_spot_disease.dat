40|$|Vitiligo is an {{autoimmune}} {{disease of the}} skin that results {{in the destruction of}} melanocytes and the clinical appearance of <b>white</b> <b>spots.</b> <b>Disease</b> pathogenesis depends on IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma-induced chemokines to promote T-cell recruitment to the epidermis where melanocytes reside. The skin is a complex organ, with a variety of resident cell types. We sought to better define the microenvironment and distinct cellular contributions during autoimmunity in vitiligo, and we found that the epidermis is a chemokine-high niche in both a mouse model and human vitiligo. Analysis of chemokine expression in mouse skin showed that CXCL 9 and CXCL 10 expression strongly correlate with disease activity, whereas CXCL 10 alone correlates with severity, supporting them as potential biomarkers for following disease progression. Further studies in both our mouse model and human patients showed that keratinocytes were the major chemokine producers throughout the course of disease, and functional studies using a conditional signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) - 1 knockout mouse showed that IFN-gamma signaling in keratinocytes was critical for disease progression and proper autoreactive T-cell homing to the epidermis. In contrast, epidermal immune cell populations including endogenous T cells, Langerhans cells, and gammadelta T cells were not required. These results have important clinical implications, because topical therapies that target IFN-gamma signaling in keratinocytes could be safe and effective new treatments, and skin expression of these chemokines could be used to monitor disease activity and treatment responses...|$|R

The objective {{of this research is}} to determine the occurrence of WSSV and the viral load in Dendronereis spp. obtained from the shrimp pond. Dendronereis spp. was obtained with PVC (10 cm in diameter) from a traditional shrimp pond in Semarang vicinity. As acomparison, healthy looking Penaeus monodon was also obtained from the same pond. The occurrence of WSSV in Dendronereis spp. was determined with 1 -step and nested PCR using primer for WSSV major envelope protein, VP 28. The viral load was counted with 1 -step Real Time PCR. The WSSV was detected in Dendronereis spp. with 1 -step and nested PCR. The point prevalence of WSSV infection in Dendronereis spp. is 90 %. The viral load ranged from 0 to 1. 9 x 104 copy of DNA/µg total DNA. The viral load in Dendronereis is comparable with that of naturally infected and at carrier state P. monodon from the same pond.

40|$|In the UK, conidia of Pseudocercosporella capsellae, the anamorph of Mycosphaerella capsellae, were {{observed}} on <b>white</b> leaf <b>spot</b> lesions on leaves throughout the growing season. Ascomata were not observed on lesions on either green or senescent leaves, although stromatic knots and spermogonia were occasionally seen in summer. However, spermogonia and protoascomata were produced in <b>white</b> leaf <b>spot</b> pod and stem lesions in early summer. Protoascomata continued to mature after harvest in these lesions on the debris. Mature ascomata subsequently developed by early autumn, but were exhausted by early January {{and did not}} overwinter. A diurnal periodicity in numbers of air-borne M. capesellae ascospores discharged from infected debris was observed with a Burkard spore sampler, with greatest numbers of ascospores collected near {{the middle of the}} day; the records also suggested that ascospores were released in response to wetting by dew or rain. Studies of natural <b>white</b> leaf <b>spot</b> epidemics in winter oilseed rape provided evidence that air-borne ascospores are the primary inoculum for initiating epidemics in the autumn in the UK. <b>White</b> leaf <b>spot</b> <b>disease</b> gradients over 100 m across a winter oilseed rape crop at Rothamsted were fitted by both negative exponential and inverse power-law models, with gradient slopes suggesting the deposition of air-borne spores dispersed from a single local source of inoculum. In comparison, no obvious <b>white</b> leaf <b>spot</b> gradients {{were observed}} over 250 m in a severely diseased crop near North Petherton, Somerset, suggesting that the air-borne spores were dispersed from a number of more distant sources in the area. Both patterns of disease were unlikely to have been initiated by P. capsellae conidia, which are dispersed only very short distances by rain-splash. However, once epidemics have been initiated by air-borne ascospores in the autumn, subsequent disease spread within an infected crop is dependent only on splash-dispersed conidia.

A portable device, namely POCKITTM, became available recently to complete fluorescent probe-based insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR), and automatic data detection and interpretation within one hour. Taking advantage of this platform, the IQ PlusTM WSSV Kit with POCKIT system was established to allow simple and easy WSSV detection for on-site users. The assay was first evaluated for its analytical sensitivity and specificity performance. The 95 % limit of detection (LOD) of the assay was 17 copies of WSSV genomic DNA per reaction (95 % confidence interval [CI], 13 to 24 copies per reaction). The established assay has detection sensitivity similar to that of OIE-registered IQ 2000 TM WSSV Detection and Protection System with serial dilutions of WSSV-positive Litopenaeus vannamei DNA.

White nodules that look like white grains of salt or sugar of up to 1 mm appear on the body, fins and gills. Each white spot is an encysted parasite. It is easily introduced into a fish pond or home aquarium by new fish or equipment which has been moved from one fish-holding unit to another. When the organism gets into a large fish culture facility, it is difficult to control due to its fast reproductive cycle and its unique life stages.

The model was calibrated for intensive shrimp cultivation in the State of Nayarit, Mexico. Mean annual production increased {{as a consequence of}} improved management from 8000 kg ha− 1 to 22, 000 kg ha− 1 when cultivation was not affected by the disease and from 3200 kg ha− 1 to 10, 400 kg ha− 1 when the disease affected production. When simultaneously considering both cases, mean annual production increased from 6300 kg ha− 1 to 16, 800 kg ha− 1. <b>White</b> <b>spot</b> <b>disease</b> was a major factor determining variability of production. Shrimp production was particularly sensitive to levels of dissolved oxygen when Management was inadequate, while final weight and mortality rate of shrimp were more sensitive when Management improved. Water temperature and salinity had intermediate importance, and mortality caused by the disease and the time when mortality occurred had intermediate or low relevance. Improving management increased shrimp production and diminished variability. The duration of cultivation and stocking density were the most important management variables controlling variability of production when cultivation was affected by the <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> <b>disease.</b> When the disease was not present, pond size and duration of cultivation were the main factors affecting production. Starting time of aeration had relatively lower importance in determining variability, while the stochastic values of dissolved oxygen, in contrast, became most important.

Objective: To study the clinico-epidemiological profile of vitiligo patients in Kumaun region of Uttarakhand state in India. Materials and Methods: The clinical presentation of vitiligo was examined and analyzed in 762 vitiligo patients attending the Dermatology outdoor of Government Medical College, Haldwani, which is a referral centre for Kumaun region of Uttarakhand state in India. Results: Male and female patients {{were found to be}} affected almost equally. It was observed that onset of vitiligo was most common in 0 - 10 years age group, as evidenced by 336 cases out of 762 cases. Acrofacial type of vitiligo (339 cases out of 762) was most commonly observed, followed by vitiligo vulgaris, focal, segmental, mucosal, mixed, and universal vitiligo. The most common site of onset was the lower limbs followed by head and neck, upper limbs, trunk, genitalia, and mucasae.

40|$|The {{etiological}} {{agent of}} maize <b>white</b> <b>spot</b> (MWS) <b>disease</b> {{has been a}} subject of controversy and discussion. Initially the disease was described as Phaeosphaeria leaf spot caused by Phaeosphaeria maydis. Other authors have suggested the existence of different fungal species causing similar symptoms. Recently, a bacterium, Pantoea ananatis, was described as the causal agent of this disease. The {{purpose of this study}} was to offer additional information on the correct etiology of this disease by providing visual evidence of the presence of the bacterium in the interior of the MWS lesions by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and molecular techniques. The TEM allowed visualization of a large amount of bacteria in the intercellular spaces of lesions collected from both artificially and naturally infected plants. Fungal structures were not visualized in young lesions. Bacterial primers for the 16 S rRNA and rpoB genes were used in PCR reactions 10 amplify DNA extracted from water-soaked (young) and necrotic lesions. The universal fungal oligonucleotide ITS 4 was also included to identify the possible presence of funga! structures inside lesions. Positive PCR products from water-soaked lesions, both from naturally and artificially inoculated plants, were produced with bacterial primers, whereas no amplification was observed when ITS 4 oligonucleotide was used. On the other hand, DNA amplification with ITS 4 primer was observed when DNA was isolated from necrotic (old) lesions.

40|$|Understanding {{the genetic}} {{background}} of a given phenotypic trait or disease has long intrigued scientists. Model organisms can be employed {{when it is not}} feasible or possible to find trait causality in human cohorts. This thesis reports the mapping of both a phenotypic trait (<b>white</b> <b>spotting)</b> and a <b>disease</b> (sensory ataxic neuropathy) in dogs, and in doing so highlights the potential of the dog as a model organism for mapping traits of relevance to human health and biology. For <b>white</b> <b>spotting,</b> a two-stage mapping approach was used to identify an associated genomic region, which contained only the microphtalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) gene. Stage 1 : a genome-wide association analysis in a single breed, taking advantage of the extensive within breed linkage disequilibrium (LD) and long haplotypes, identified a discrete region of approximately 1 Mb. Stage 2 : finemapping in an additional breed presenting the same phenotype, exploiting the short LD and haplotypes shared across dog breeds, was used to narrow the region to about 100 kb. We functionally evaluated two candidate polymorphisms associated with MITF, a SINE insertion and a length polymorphism upstream of the melanocyte-specific transcription start site of MITF. The data indicated that both polymorphisms affect transcription from the MITF-M promoter. Sensory ataxic neuropathy (SAN) is a neurological disorder affecting a specific maternal lineage of Golden Retrievers. We identified a one base pair deletion in mitochondrial tRNATyr and through biochemical analyses of mitochondria and functional studies of the deletion, confirmed causality and the mitochondrial origin of SAN. This {{is one of the first}} mitochondrial disorders identified in dogs and we additionally developed a genetic test for the public to allow for the elimination of the disease from this breed. The genetic and functional analyses of both <b>white</b> <b>spotting</b> coat colour and SAN in dogs, which are controlled by mutations of the two different genomes, clearly demonstrate the utility of the canine model and establish a new role for man's best friend. ...|$|R
