500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Savior" [...] {{deviates}} {{from the}} social and political topics normally discussed in Rise Against songs, and is instead about forgiveness and broken relationships. It {{tells the story of a}} couple who have recently split up. The two attempt to reconcile their differences, with lines such as [...] "I don't hate you, boy / I just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> you while there's still something left to save." [...] Hanson and Liz Ramanand of Loudwire have characterized the lyrics as [...] "poignant", and [...] "poetic".|$|E
500|$|Nature is {{a strong}} {{influence}} to many folk metal bands. Groups such as Korpiklaani, Elvenking, Midnattsol and Vintersorg have all based lyrics on the subject. For the band Agalloch, nature is an embraced theme [...] "because we are siding with what is essentially the victim in a relationship where humankind is a disease." [...] All the members of Skyclad are supporters of [...] "organisations like Greenpeace and others, for {{those are the ones}} who stand up and take on the battle" [...] between [...] "people who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> the planet, and people who want to destroy it." ...|$|E
500|$|Greenwalt {{discusses}} how Cordelia [...] "is sort {{of forced}} {{to become a}} deeper character" [...] when she starts to receive the visions of the suffering and helpless, [...] "She's sort of living with {{one foot in the}} world of 'I want to be an actress' and with another foot in the world of 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> and help people, and I have a deeper purpose and mission.'" [...] Greenwalt felt that this development allowed Cordelia to develop from a [...] "vainglorious high schooler to someone who's almost like a superhero"; this also provided Carpenter with the opportunity to stretch her potential as an actress. From the tenth episode, [...] "Parting Gifts", Cordelia begins to actively function as a supernatural character in the series while the introduction of Wesley also contributes some added comic relief to the series. It is from this episode Cordelia is also forced to mature as she mourns the death of Doyle, whose visions serve as a painful reminder of him. The first-season finale saw Cordelia's visions inflict all the suffering of the human world upon her, and to effectively act this, Carpenter's acting coach showed her pictures of real human pain as motivation. The scene took over eight hours to film, and Carpenter was relieved when it was over. The experience saw Cordelia further resolve to help those in need, stating [...] "I saw the world and there's so much pain. We have to help them." [...] Carpenter explains, [...] "Through the suffering of the world, and through her own experiences, she discovers what's important in life." ...|$|E

2500|$|On December 15, 2014, Coburn stalled the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act {{aimed at}} {{stemming}} veteran suicides. [...] The bill {{would require a}} report on successful veteran suicide prevention programs and allow the VA to pay incentives to hire psychiatrists.

[...] “It’s a shame that after two decades of service in Washington, Sen. Coburn will always be remembered for this final, misguided attack on veterans nationwide,” he said. “If it takes 90 days for the new Congress to re-pass this bill, the statistics tell us another 1,980 vets will have died by suicide. That should be a heavy burden on the conscience of Sen. Coburn and this Congress.” Speaking out against the legislation, Coburn said “I object, not because I don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> suicides, but because I don’t think this bill will do the first thing to change what’s happening,” arguing the bill" [...] "throws money and doesn’t solve the real problem" ...|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert, who {{had given}} the 2007 film three stars, [...] gave the sequel only one, calling it [...] "...a horrible {{experience}} of unbearable length", a phrase which later became {{the title of his}} third bad-movie-reviews collection. Later in his review, Ebert discouraged movie-goers from seeing the film by saying [...] "If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> yourself the ticket price, go into the kitchen, cue up a male choir singing the music of hell, and get a kid to start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and use your imagination."

It will be seen, in retrospect, as marking the end of an era. Of course there will be many more CGI-based action epics, but never again one this bloated, excessive, incomprehensible, long (149 minutes) or expensive ($200 million)." [...] Ebert would continue to lambast the film (and, sometimes, the Transformers franchise in general) in other movie reviews and responses to letters and emails sent to him.

Among positive reviews, Robbie Collin of News of the World remarked [...] "It's bigger. Badder. Boobier. And many other words beginning with B, including boneheadedly brilliant.", Amy Biancolli of The Houston Chronicle called it [...] "a well-oiled, loudly revving summer action vehicle that does all that's required, and then some", Jordan Mintzer from Variety said it [...] "takes the franchise to a vastly superior level of artificial intelligence", and Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Revenge of the Fallen may be a massive overdose of popcorn greased with motor oil.
