500|$|Brittany's role in {{the show}} was {{initially}} intended to be minor, but grew {{towards the end of}} the first season. She does not have any solo musical performances during season one, but Morris hoped she would have one in the second season. On April 27, 2010, Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly reported that Morris would be upgraded to a series regular for season two. Speaking to E! Online, Morris commented: [...] "It's so fun.

But those who really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about Russians sooner or later {{recognize}} that Russia is not all contained in Dostoyevsky and Chekhov, and {{that if you want to}} know anything, you must first be free of prejudice and on your guard against hasty generalizations." ...|$|E

2500|$|Radical economists point out, that a {{considerable}} portion of incomes and expenditures is not {{captured by the}} GDP concept because it falls outside the defined production boundary, while incomes/expenditures within the production boundary are allocated to categories which are substantially misleading. Not only are GDP data frequently revised after first publication, but the popular idea that GDP equals [...] "the whole economy" [...] is a fallacy. The more that the national accounts system has been revised across fifty years, and the more that economic theory and practice has changed, the less meaningful national accounts aggregates have become in capturing {{what is happening in}} reality. Analysts end up doing a lot of detailed disaggregate research to figure out what is going on, because the official national accounts aggregates don't tell them what they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> (<b>more</b> detailed data is increasingly available, because official statisticians make available digital data warehouses, enabling datamining). The 2008 revision of the UNSNA standard national accounts tries to realign the system more with the modern realities of capital finance, but in the process, the original intention of the accounts to measure [...] "physical" [...] changes in wealth is, in some respects, superseded. According to OECD data for the year 2000, cited by the World Bank, physical capital represents only one-quarter of the capital stock of rich countries, and all the rest is [...] "intangible capital". But UNSNA national accounts were originally never designed to measure the [...] "intangible capital." [...] The contemporary concept of [...] "wealth creation" [...] is substantially different from the concept that was entertained in the mid-20th century, among other things because who exactly and legally owns the wealth, often becomes a secondary issue in business. An asset may be held which generates profit income, but it could be a borrowed asset via-via, or an asset the value of which can be difficult to define. This can create new problems for statisticians seeking to estimate additions to wealth.|$|E
