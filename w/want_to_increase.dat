25|$|In open-access {{resources}} {{like fish}} stocks, {{in the absence}} of a system like individual transferable quotas, the impossibility of excluding others provokes the fishermen who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> catch to do so effectively by taking someone else' share, intensifying competition. This tragedy of the commons provokes a capitalization process that leads them to increase their costs until they are equal to their revenue, dissipating their rent completely.|$|E
500|$|Curteis {{ran into}} several {{problems}} while directing the film. Owing to his absence of feature film experience, the film's tight schedule, and limited funding, he became quickly overwhelmed, and The Projected Man started going over its budget and falling behind on schedule. Executive producers Tony Tenser and Michael Klinger threatened {{to take over}} production as they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> the budget. Since Croydon had hired Curteis, it became his responsibility to fire him and finish directing the film. Richard Gordon suggested that [...] "I think Curteis was relieved to step out because he simply didn't know any longer what to do." [...] Croydon was not credited for his directing work on the film; as Gordon said, [...] "one tries not to publicize such incidents." ...|$|E

60|$|I had {{to think}} this over. Feeling kindly {{disposed}} towards Mr Arnold Abney, I wished to do him as little harm as possible. I was going to rob him of a boy, who, while no moulding of his growing mind could make him into a hereditary legislator, did undoubtedly represent a portion of Mr Abney's annual income; and I did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> my offence by being a useless assistant-master. Then I reflected that, if I was no Jowett, at least I knew enough Latin and Greek to teach the rudiments of those languages to small boys. My conscience was satisfied.|$|E
60|$|The {{way this}} is done is by {{artificial}} selection, {{and it is very}} important to understand this process and its results. Suppose we have a plant with a small edible seed, and we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> the size of that seed. We grow as large a quantity of it as possible, and when the crop is ripe we carefully choose a few of the very largest seeds, or we may by means of a sieve sort out a quantity of the largest seeds. Next year we sow only these large seeds, taking care to give them suitable soil and manure, and the result is found to be that the average size of the seeds is larger than in the first crop, and that the largest seeds are now somewhat larger and more numerous. Again sowing these, we obtain a further slight increase of size, and in a very few years we obtain a greatly improved race, which will always produce larger seeds than the unimproved race, even if cultivated without any special care. In this way all our fine sorts of vegetables, fruits, and flowers have been obtained, all our choice breeds of cattle or of poultry, our wonderful race-horses, and our endless varieties of dogs. It is a very common but mistaken idea that this improvement is due to crossing and feeding in the case of animals, and to improved cultivation in the case of plants. Crossing is occasionally used in order to obtain a combination of qualities found in two distinct breeds, and also because it is found to increase the constitutional vigour; but every breed possessing any exceptional quality is the result of the selection of variations occurring year after year and accumulated in the manner just described. Purity of breed, with repeated selection of the best varieties of that breed, is the foundation of all improvement in our domestic animals and cultivated plants.|$|E
