5|$|Astronomers {{estimate}} that the Solar System as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today</b> will not change drastically until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning its evolution from the main sequence of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and into its red-giant phase. Even so, the Solar System will continue to evolve until then.|$|E
5|$|More than 170million years ago, Antarctica {{was part}} of the supercontinent Gondwana. Over time, Gondwana {{gradually}} broke apart and Antarctica as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today</b> was formed around 25million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.|$|E

50|$|Mill {{had been}} engaged in a pen-friendship with Auguste Comte, the founder of {{positivism}} and sociology, since Mill first contacted Comte in November 1841. Comte's sociologie was more an early philosophy of science than <b>we</b> perhaps <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today,</b> and the positive philosophy aided in Mill's broad rejection of Benthamism.|$|R
50|$|Roman Faria {{was taken}} over by the Slavs at the {{beginning}} of the 8th century. At this point, the town received the name <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> by <b>today</b> - Hvar (the letter F not being part of the old Slavonic alphabet). During the 10th century, Hvar came under the Narentines. Pirates from Omiš on the mainland were raiding the coastal settlements, and new villages grew up in the foothills - Dol, Vrbanj and Pitve.|$|R
5|$|The Solar System {{will remain}} roughly as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today</b> until the {{hydrogen}} {{in the core}} of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will collapse, and the energy output will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence. The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and render Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon—to the interstellar medium.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} quantum chromodynamics was {{formulated}} {{beginning in the}} early 1960s. The theory as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today</b> was formulated by Politzer, Gross and Wilczek in 1975.|$|E
5000|$|Caesarea Philippi - Ancient Greek: Καισαρεία Φιλίππεια or Caesarea Paneas (Καισαρεία Πανειάς); called [...] "Neronias" [...] for a {{short period}} of time - was an ancient Roman city located at the southwestern base of Mount Hermon. It was {{adjacent}} to a spring, grotto and related shrines dedicated to the Greek god Pan, and called [...] "Paneas" [...] since the Hellenistic period, a name which mutated in time to Banias, as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> until <b>today</b> (not to be confused with Baniyas in northwestern Syria).

50|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1969 {{created the}} private {{foundation}} as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> of <b>it</b> <b>today</b> where {{the tax code}} imposed the present day legal framework. These restrictions came about as a reform effort to remedy perceived abuses of private foundations such as the claim {{that this type of}} charitable organization more likely served the private interests of the rich rather than the intended charitable purpose. Such criticism asserted that private individuals created private foundations as a vehicle to protect their assets from taxation; meanwhile the descendants may assert control over these assets almost in perpetuity. This is the context from which the present day legal framework arose.|$|R
25|$|The {{coordination}} of various machine elements including leadscrew, slide rest, and change gears was the technological advance {{that allowed the}} invention of the screw-cutting lathe, which was the origin of single-point threading as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Arabic script as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today</b> {{was unknown}} in Muhammad’s time (as Arabic writing styles have progressed through time) and the Quran was {{preserved}} through memorization and written references on different materials. As Arab society started to evolve into using writing more regularly, writing skills evolved accordingly. Early Quranic Arabic lacked precision because distinguishing between consonants was impossible {{due to the}} absence of diacritical marks (a’jam). Vowelling marks (tashkil) to indicate prolongation or vowels were absent as well. Due to this there were endless possibilities for the mispronunciation of the word. The Arabic script as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today,</b> the scripta plena, which has pointed texts and is fully vowelled was not perfected until the middle of the 9th century.|$|E
50|$|The {{first known}} {{envelope}} {{was nothing like}} the paper envelope <b>we</b> <b>know</b> of <b>today.</b> <b>It</b> can be dated back to around 3500 to 3200 BC in the ancient Middle East. Hollow, clay spheres were molded around financial tokens and used in private transactions. The two people who discovered these first envelopes were Jacques de Morgan, in 1901, and Roland de Mecquenem, in 1907.|$|R
5000|$|The Irish {{were among}} the first people in Europe to use {{surnames}} as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> them <b>today.</b> <b>It</b> is very common for people of Gaelic origin to have the English versions of their surnames beginning with [...] "O'" [...] or [...] "Mc" [...] (less frequently [...] "Mac" [...] and occasionally shortened to just [...] "Ma" [...] {{at the beginning of the}} name).|$|R
50|$|The town of Villaines-la-Juhel was {{not created}} by chance. Its {{position}} on a strategic Roman way was what enabled it to develop into the city which <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>today.</b> <b>Its</b> size confers a position of a town of the third rank on a departmental scale, at the demographic and administrative level. Villaines-la-Juhel is a relatively insulated rural pole and depends on other administrative divisions.|$|R
25|$|The {{history of}} Chan in China {{can be divided}} into several periods. Chan as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today</b> {{is the result of a}} long history, with many changes and {{contingent}} factors. Each period had different types of Chan, some of which have remained influential, while others vanished.|$|E
25|$|The {{accordion}} {{is a free}} reed {{instrument and}} is in the same family as other instruments such as the sheng and khaen. The sheng and khaen are both much older than the accordion and this type of reed did inspire the kind of free reeds in use in the accordion as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{a series}} of {{problems}} surrounding its presentation in Naples after the final dress rehearsal – including having to be re-written for a totally different location, a different time period, and with Buondelmonte as its new title – Maria Stuarda as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today</b> premiered on 30 December 1835 at La Scala in Milan.|$|E
30|$|This {{study will}} utilize ego-centered {{networks}} and the nominalist strategy {{to observe the}} selected social actors’ networks and demonstrate how they tugged their state-crime ‘webs of significance’ (Venkatesh 2013) to achieve their self-interest; thus, steering the development of Las Vegas and Macao to what <b>we</b> <b>know</b> of <b>it</b> <b>today.</b> The study will rely on primary and secondary sources of data to identify alters with ties to the focal actors, and use the collected data to inform the research of the overall social embeddedness of the focal actors’ networks during their respective selected time frames. This is an acceptable data collection strategy in SNA for acquiring recorded data on social relations (Scott 2013, p. 41).|$|R
40|$|The United Nations {{was created}} in 1942 as a {{political}} military alliance {{and went on to}} create a range of global institutions including those <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>today.</b> <b>It</b> tried to overcome the weaknesses of the League by creating more enforcement powers. Despite the pressures of the Cold War, weak commitments to it success by leading powers and internal ineffectiveness the UN survives and even thrives as the premier global institution...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} this {{research}} prove there is a statistically positive relationship between social capitals with increasing revenue. Social capital had a positive role for physical capital and education, {{as well as its}} contribution in creating greater business profits. The study  also found the influence of social capital (23 %), physical capital (11 %) and capital or other variables (66 %) for business profits. In conclusion, social capital as an asset has the potency to complement or replace the business assets, as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> in <b>today’s</b> modern business world. In order to be an asset, it is necessary to establish a forum to provide certification of social capital on SME so it would work together with other economic assets in business activities...|$|R
25|$|In {{front of}} the {{building}} was a public square which was given the name Empress Place by the Municipal Council in 1907 in honour of Queen Victoria. It may well be the oldest pedestrian space in Singapore. Over time, Government Offices became associated with Empress Place and its name changed to what <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} stated as being {{doubtful}} whether Knudson {{would have been}} successful without Mead’s inputs and donation of viable ripe orchid seeds, so arguably {{he should have been}} credited as a co-discoverer. Improved versions of Knudson’s solution are used today for orchid seed germination, and the accomplishment was the catalyst for the emergence of the orchid industry as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Anegada {{ground iguana}} is noted {{as the oldest}} species of Cyclura and the most genetically {{divergent}} of the West Indies' rock iguanas. An ancestor to this iguana first dispersed to Hispaniola, then onwards {{to the north and}} western islands, which has since diversified on different islands into the 9 species and several additional subspecies of the genus Cyclura as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Byzantine Empire is {{accredited}} by {{some for}} having invented the hospital as the institution <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> to be <b>today.</b> Professor Timothy S. Miller of the Johns Hopkins University {{argues that the}} Byzantine Empire {{was the first to}} employ a system of hospital-based healthcare, where the hospital became the chief institution of the medical profession in contrast to its function as a last resort in Western medieval Europe, carrying forward the medical knowledge of ancient Greece and Rome.|$|R
50|$|During the parade, Disney played Baroque Hoedown as {{the main}} theme, and used it as {{background}} support while playing the theme songs from their television shows. The melody of this song is featured {{in a number of}} theme songs that <b>we</b> all <b>know</b> <b>today.</b> <b>It</b> is featured in the theme from Rock to the Future, The Unbirthday Song, and many more. It was also featured in the short film Mouse Mania.|$|R
50|$|On 22 May 1873, the Italian {{writer and}} humanist Alessandro Manzoni, whom Verdi had admired all {{his adult life}} and met in 1868, died. Upon hearing of his death, Verdi {{resolved}} to complete a Requiem—this time entirely of his own writing—for Manzoni. Verdi traveled to Paris in June, where he commenced work on the Requiem, giving <b>it</b> the form <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>today.</b> <b>It</b> included a revised version of the Libera me originally composed for Rossini.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{powerful}} kings was the Swedish king who according to early sources only ruled what is today eastern Svealand. It is unknown when it happened and it probably happened several times, but when sources become more reliable the territories of the Swedish kings include Västergötland and other parts of Götaland. This stage is by some considered to be the beginning of Sweden, as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
25|$|It was the {{industrial}} revolution {{that gave birth to}} environmental pollution as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today.</b> London also recorded one of the earlier extreme cases of water quality problems with the Great Stink on the Thames of 1858, which led to construction of the London sewerage system soon afterward. Pollution issues escalated as population growth far exceeded view ability of neighborhoods to handle their waste problem. Reformers began to demand sewer systems, and clean water.|$|E
25|$|French Polynesia as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>today</b> {{was one of}} {{the last}} places on Earth to be settled by humans. Scientists believe the Great Polynesian Migration {{happened}} around 1500 BC as Austronesian people went on a journey using celestial navigation to find islands in the South Pacific Ocean. The first islands of French Polynesia to be settled were the Marquesas Islands in about 200 BC. The Polynesians later ventured southwest and discovered the Society Islands around AD 300.|$|E
50|$|Deep Time History is an {{original}} documentary series that {{was released on}} the video on demand service CuriosityStream, in partnership with production company Flight 33 Productions. The three-part series was included in CuriosityStream's January 2015 launch announcement. The three-part series is hosted by California State University Fullerton Associate Professor Jonathan Markley and exposes the secret drivers behind human history, revealing the sometimes unexpected answers to questions {{of how and why}} civilization as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> exists <b>today.</b> <b>It</b> provides a look at how Deep time has precipitated crucial events in human history. Each 50-minute episode dives deep into how physics, geology, biology and chemistry—forces {{as far back as the}} formation of our planet—have influenced world history as much as our own innovations, political decisions or battlefield victories. All three episodes were released in July 2016.|$|R
5000|$|Reagan won the {{election}} in Ohio with a decisive 18 point landslide. While Ohio typically voted conservative at the time, {{the election}} results in Ohio are also reflective of a nationwide reconsolidation of base for the Republican Party which took place through the 1980s; called by Reagan the [...] "second American Revolution." [...] This was most evident during the 1984 presidential election. The election of 1984 {{is also one of}} the final elections where Ohio has reliably turned out for the Republican presidential candidate, and marks the end of a political era for the State, which has since transformed more into the swing state that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> as <b>today.</b> No Republican candidate has received as strong of support in the American Great Lakes States, at large, since Reagan.|$|R
50|$|Oluopo {{later in}} life met a Princess from Oni Ilare’s Compound in Ile-Ife, {{who used to be}} Oluopo’s trading partner. She used to buy bush meats from Oluopo. They later became friends and {{eventually}} got married. The marriage was blessed with three children, Agbangudu, Larele, and Akintayo. Later on in life, the children migrated to different places. Agbangudu migrated to Ede, Larele to Apomu, and Akintayo to Ibadan whose grand children became an Olubadan {{later in life}}. Around Oluopo’s hut were plenty of shrubs called Ookun. The shrubs were so many that they formed a very thick cluster known as Iba. These two names, Iba and Ookun, were put together by Oluopo and all his customers as well as passers-by to name his settlement as Iba Ookun (thick cluster of shrubs) and which later on became Baakun as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> till <b>today.</b>|$|R
