5|$|In January 1851, Allen {{purchased}} the Eagle flour mills, an historically important industrial {{building in the}} area, which eventually gave the hamlet of Eagle Mills its name. The factory {{had a long history}} of failed business attempts. It was built in 1821 by Daniel Sheldon to mill flour using wheat supplied from Troy. After brief success, the business closed and the building sat idle. It was sold to James Bumstead who reopened the building as a feed mill. He too had troubles and sold the building to James McChesney, who kept the building idle for some time before transferring the property to Catlin and Saxton, who began the manufacture of augers and bits. Also unsuccessful, Catlin and Saxton abandoned the business and James McChesney (whose name was still on the deed) sold the property to Groome and Shattuck, who began manufacturing monkey <b>wrenches.</b> This too failed and the property was sold to Paul Smith, a miller from nearby Cropseyville, who sold the property to Allen in 1851 because Smith later decided that he preferred to keep his mills consolidated in Cropseyville.|$|E

25|$|Polishing {{operations}} for {{items such as}} chisels, hammers, screwdrivers, <b>wrenches,</b> etc., are given a fine finish but not plated. In order to achieve this finish four operations are required: roughing, dry fining, greasing, and coloring. Note that roughing is usually done on a solid grinding wheel and for an extra fine polish the greasing operation may be broken up into two operations: rough greasing and fine greasing. However, for inexpensive items money is saved by only performing the first two operations.|$|E
50|$|The {{electric}} torque <b>wrench</b> {{is sometimes}} confused {{with a standard}} impact <b>wrench,</b> because it looks similar, but it actually a totally different tool. An electric torque <b>wrench</b> is driven by continuous gearing, and not by the hammers of an impacting <b>wrench.</b> This is why an electric torque <b>wrench</b> has very little vibration, and an extreme amount of repeatability and accuracy.The electric torque <b>wrench</b> was first patented in Germany in 1984 by Alkitronic.|$|R

The Universal Atlas Cement Company, which made cement from the slag byproduct of the steel plant, began operations in 1917.|$|E
25|$|In geometry, Plücker coordinates, {{introduced}} by Julius Plücker in the 19th century, {{are a way}} to assign six homogeneous coordinates to each line in projective 3-space, P3. Because they satisfy a quadratic constraint, they establish a one-to-one correspondence between the 4-dimensional space of lines in P3 and points on a quadric in P5 (projective 5-space). A predecessor and special case of Grassmann coordinates (which describe k-dimensional linear subspaces, or flats, in an n-dimensional Euclidean space), Plücker coordinates arise naturally in geometric algebra. They have proved useful for computer graphics, and also can be extended to coordinates for the screws and <b>wrenches</b> {{in the theory of}} kinematics used for robot control.|$|E

The carpenter makes a coffin for Queequeg, who fears an ordinary burial at sea. Queequeg tries it for size, with Pip sobbing and beating his tambourine, standing by and calling himself a coward while he praises Queequeg for his gameness. Yet Queequeg suddenly rallies, briefly convalesces, and leaps up, back in good health. Henceforth, he uses his coffin for a spare seachest, which is later caulked and pitched to replace the Pequods life buoy.|$|E
50|$|In Commonwealth English (excluding Canada), spanner is the {{standard}} term. The most common shapes are called open-ended spanner and ring spanner.

25|$|Sea Shepherd's Coronado and David Howitt {{flew into}} Reykjavík in October 1986. Howitt {{has also been}} named as David Howard, Nick Taylor or Martin Braidley. The pair stayed at a youth hostel and began covertly {{investigating}} the local whaling industry {{and it has been}} reported that they posed as tourists and took jobs at a fish factory. On 8 November, they traveled 50miles to the nation's only whale processing station in Hvalfjörður, where they broke in at 8:00pm. Sledgehammers, <b>wrenches,</b> and other common tools were used to systematically destroy computers, power generators, machinery, and windows. The large refrigeration unit used to freeze the season's catch was destroyed beyond repair and documentation at the facility was doused with acid. The main factory and two smaller buildings were left inoperable.|$|E

500|$|LoPiccolo {{composed}} the game's score—called [...] "dark", [...] "electronic" [...] and [...] "cyberpunk" [...] by the Boston Herald—on a Macintosh computer and inexpensive synthesizer, using Audio Vision. It dynamically changes {{according to the}} player's actions, a decision made {{in keeping with the}} team's focus on emergent gameplay. Each track was [...] "written at three different intensity levels", which change depending on the player's nearness to enemies; and certain events, such as victory in combat, trigger special music. The game's tracks were composed of four-bar segments that could be rearranged dynamically in reaction to game events, with [...] "melodies through-composed on top". LoPiccolo noted that, when using this method, it is necessary to write music that [...] "still flows with the overall theme and doesn't jump around". Because the score was closely tied to the gameplay, LoPiccolo had to work closely with Church and Rob Fermier, the latter of whom wrote the [...] "interactive scoring module" [...] that allowed for dynamic music. After recording the music, LoPiccolo recorded all of the game's sound effects. He later recalled visiting an automobile repair shop with [...] "portable recorder and a mic", and [...] "having [...] mechanic [...] hit things with <b>wrenches</b> and so forth, just to get the raw material". He developed the game's audio over 16 months, working on a contractual basis until Tribe disbanded in May 1994; Ned Lerner gave him a full-time job as audio director the next day. Tim Ries {{composed the}} [...] "Elevator" [...] music.|$|E

2500|$|Drummers use a drum key for tuning their {{drums and}} {{adjusting}} some drum hardware. Besides the basic type of drum key (a T-handled wrench) {{there are various}} tuning <b>wrenches</b> and tools. Basic drum keys are divided in three types which allows tuning of three types of tuning screws on drums: square (most used), slotted and hexagonal. Ratchet-type <b>wrenches</b> allow high-tension drums to be tuned easily. Spin keys (utilizing a ball joint) allow rapid head changing. Torque-wrench type keys are available, graphically revealing the torque at each lug. Also, tension gauges, or meters, which are set on the head, aid drummers to achieve a consistent tuning. Drummers can tune drums [...] "by ear" [...] or, in the 2010s, use a digital drum tuner, which [...] "measures tympanic pressure" [...] on the drumhead to provide accurate tuning.|$|E
