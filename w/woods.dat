The morphological, chemical, and metabolic analyses of juvenile <b>wood</b> and compression <b>wood</b> show that although compression <b>wood</b> and juvenile <b>wood</b> share some properties, they are actually distinct in their chemistry during development and in final <b>wood</b> chemistry and anatomy.
