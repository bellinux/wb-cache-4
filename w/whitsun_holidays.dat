60|$|After the Easter {{holidays}} the Trafficks {{came back}} to Queen's Gate, making a combination of honeymoon and business which did very well for a time. It was understood that {{it was to be}} so. During honeymoon times the fashionable married couple is always lodged and generally boarded for nothing. That opening wide of generous hands, which exhibits itself in the joyous enthusiasm of a coming marriage, taking the shape of a houseful of presents, of a gorgeous and ponderous trousseau, of a splendid marriage feast, and not unfrequently of subsidiary presents from the opulent papa,--presents which are subsidiary to the grand substratum of settled dowry,--generously extends itself to luxurious provision for a month or two. That Mr. and Mrs. Traffick should come back to Queen's Gate for the six weeks intervening between Easter and Whitsuntide had been arranged, and arranged also that the use of Merle Park, for the <b>Whitsun</b> <b>holidays,</b> should be allowed to them. This last boon Augusta, with her sweetest kiss, had obtained from her father only two days before the wedding. But when it was suggested, just before the departure to Merle Park, that Mr. Traffick's unnecessary boots might be left at Queen's Gate, because he would come back there, then Sir Thomas, who had thought over the matter, said a word.|$|E

Sales of white ankle socks went up by 200 dozen in the area and I had only sent 10. The manager of the store was soon on the phone shouting about what some stupid person had done. I had to drive to the supplier in Leicestershire and deliver the socks myself. It saved my job. Without that I don't think I would be here now. It taught me that in retailing every store is different." ...|$|E

25|$|Objections {{were made}} against the closure, notably from the Kent County Council and Strood Rural District Council which {{challenged}} BR's method of calculating passenger numbers and losses. They {{argued that the}} figures (i) failed to consider cheaper methods of running the line such as using diesel traction units, closing minor halts, eliminating unnecessary journeys, the operation of direct summer excursions from London to Allhallows and the combination of passenger and goods services, (ii) took into account costs incurred for the line between Gravesend and Grain which would remain open for freight, (iii) included a figure of £5,000 which would be paid to Maidstone & District Motor Services for replacement bus services, (iv) failed {{to take into account}} holiday traffic - 2,812 passengers having used Allhallows on the <b>Whitsun</b> <b>holiday</b> of 3/6 June 1960, and (v) failed to record the 25% increase in passenger numbers or take into account the ongoing residential development in the area.|$|R

25|$|A {{century after}} the 1871 Act, the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971, which {{currently}} regulates bank holidays in the UK, was passed. The {{majority of the}} current bank holidays were specified in the 1971 Act: however New Year's Day and May Day were not introduced throughout {{the whole of the}} UK until 1974 and 1978 respectively. The date of the August bank holiday was changed from the first Monday in August to the last Monday in August, and the <b>Whitsun</b> bank <b>holiday</b> (Whit Monday) was replaced by the Late Spring Bank Holiday, fixed as the last Monday in May. In 1978 the first Monday in May {{in the rest of the}} UK, and the final Monday of May in Scotland, were designated as bank holidays.|$|R

50|$|If Davidstow had {{one clear}} {{advantage}} over other circuits {{it was that}} there was a distinct absence of complaining populace. Two meetings were planned for 1953, on the <b>Whitsun</b> Bank <b>Holiday</b> Monday and on 1 August. The Bank Holiday dawned over Cornwall as a lovely summer's day and a crowd of 20,000 was hoped for, but this being Bodmin Moor it was blanketed in fog. After sheep were cleared from the bank straight, the weather had improved sufficiently to allow the drivers to have their statutory three laps of practice. So Davidstow’s first race commenced (as opposed to speed trails and relay races) over five laps for the first heat of the sports car race up to 1,500 cc. It was won by M.G. Llewellyn in an MG TD. After more fog related problems, Davidstow witnessed its first race for real racing cars - Formula Three over 20 laps. Two Kiefts won from two Coopers, Paulson and Westcott leading home Nurse and Piers. The winner’s average speed was 71.53 mph, with the fastest lap being shared between three drivers at 73.9 mph.|$|R
50|$|Whitsun (also Whitsunday, Whit Sunday or Whit) is {{the name}} used in Britain and Ireland, and among Anglicans and Methodists {{throughout}} the world, for the Christian festival of Pentecost, the eighth Sunday after Easter, which commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Christ's disciples (Acts of the Apostles chapter 2). In England it took on some characteristics of Beltane, which originated from the pagan celebration of Summer's Day, {{the beginning of the}} summer half-year, in Europe. Whitsuntide, the week following Whitsunday, was one of three vacation weeks for the medieval villein; on most manors he was free from service on the lord's demesne this week, which marked a pause in the agricultural year. Whit Monday, the day after <b>Whitsun,</b> remained a <b>holiday</b> in the UK until 1971 when, with effect from 1972, the movable holiday was replaced with the fixed Spring Bank Holiday on the last Monday in May. Whit was the occasion for varied forms of celebration.|$|R
