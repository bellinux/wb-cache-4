40|$|AbstractThe well SK-I in the Songliao Basin is {{the first}} {{scientific}} borehole targeting the continental Cretaceous strata in China. Oval concretions, thin laminae and beds of dolostone are found intercalated within mudstone and organic-rich black shale in the Nenjiang Formation of Campanian age. Low ordered ferruginous dolomite is composed of euhedral–subhedral rhombs with cloudy nucleus and light rims formed during the diagenesis, which are typical features of replacement. The heavy carbon isotopes (δ 13 CPDB – 1. 16 – 16. 0) are results of both the fermentation of organic matter by microbes and degassing of carbon dioxide {{during the period of}} diagenesis, and the presence of light oxygen isotopes (δ 18 OPDB – 18. 53 ∼− 5. 1) is a characteristic feature of fresh water influence which means the carbonate may have been altered by ground water or rainwater in the late diagenesis. Marine <b>water</b> <b>incursions</b> into the normally lacustrine basin have been proved by both the salinity of Z value and the occurrence of foraminifera in the same strata where dolomite occurs. Pyrite framboids observed by SEM are usually enclosed in the dolomite crystals or in the mudstones, supporting the sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB). The formation of both dolomite and pyrite are associated with marine <b>water</b> <b>incursions,</b> which not only supply magnesium ion for dolomite, but also result in limited carbonate precipitation in the basin. The presence of pyrite framboids indicates the development of an anoxic environment associated with salinity stratification in the lake. The dolomite in the Nenjiang Formation is the results of marine <b>water</b> <b>incursions,</b> diagenetic replacement of calcareous carbonate and sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) ...|$|R

An investigation, prior to a 1995 development in the village, discovered a farm and large tile-kiln of Romano-British origin; further investigations uncovered an earlier settlement of the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The Roman road Akeman Street passed through the north-west corner of the parish, and the lost 7th century Anglo-Saxon village of Cratendune may be nearby.|$|R

40|$|Historically, the Holocene {{has been}} {{considered}} an interval of relatively stable climate. However, recent studies from the northern Arabian Sea (Netherlands Indian Ocean Program 905) suggested high-amplitude climate shifts in the early and middle Holocene based on faunal and benthic isotopic proxy records. We examined benthic foraminiferal faunal and stable isotopic data from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 723 and total organic carbon data from ODP Site 724, Oman Margin (808 and 593 m water depths, respectively). At Site 723 the mid-Holocene shift in d 18 O values of infaunal benthic species Uvigerina peregrina (1. 4 per mil) is 3 times larger than that of epifaunal benthic species Cibicides kullenbergi recorded at Site NIOP 905 off Somalia. However, none of the five other benthic species we measured at Hole 723 A exhibits such a shift in d 18 O. We speculate that the late Holocene d 18 O decrease in U. peregrina represents species-specific changes in ecological habitat or food preference in response to changes in surface and deep ocean circulation. While the stable isotopic data {{do not appear to}} indicate a middle Holocene climatic shift, our total organic carbon and benthic faunal assemblage data do indicate that the early Holocene deep Arabian Sea was influenced by increased ventilation perhaps by North Atlantic Deep Water and/or Circumpolar Deep <b>Water</b> <b>incursions</b> into the Indian Ocean, leading to remineralization of organic matter and a relatively weak early Holocene oxygen minimum zone in the northwest Arabian Sea in spite of strong summer monsoon circulation...|$|R
40|$|Coastal {{freshwater}} wetland {{chemistry is}} rapidly changing {{due to increased}} frequency of salt <b>water</b> <b>incursion,</b> a consequence of global change. Seasonal salt <b>water</b> <b>incursion</b> introduces sulfate, which microbially reduces to sulfide.

Correlations between soil chloride and iron or sulfur reduction rates were strongest in the surface layer (0 – 3 cm), indicative of surface <b>water</b> <b>incursion,</b> rather than groundwater intrusion at our site. The interaction between soil moisture and extractable chloride was significantly related to increased AVS, whereas increased soil chloride was a stronger predictor of CRS.

30|$|The isoresistivity and {{isopach map}} shows {{that some of}} the aquifer units were found to be {{strongly}} impacted by saline water due to incursion from the sea. It was observed that boreholes located in the eastern and southern parts of Lekki, Victoria Island–Ikoyi axis are closer to the coastline. These boreholes are the first contact of saline <b>water</b> <b>incursion.</b> This explains the relatively low resistivity values obtained in these regions. We strongly perceive that daily excessive groundwater extraction has aggravated the saline <b>water</b> <b>incursion</b> in this region and has made it to penetrate into deeper aquifers. This is because most of the locations of the boreholes along the Lekki coastlines are reclaimed peninsula where the lands are sand filled to a thickness of about 25  m or more (Adepelumi et al. 2009). Furthermore, increase in population which in turn has caused induced flow of saline water into freshwater aquifers by overpumping also contributed in no small measure to the saline <b>water</b> <b>incursion</b> into the aquifer system. The most recent survey carried out in this region showed that the depth extent of pollution averaged 148  m (Oladapo et al. 2014) while recent studies show that the depth extent of pollution has now increased to an average depth of 156  m. This clearly outlines the danger posed on the sustainable use of freshwater aquifers if the threat of saltwater incursion is not adequately managed.|$|E

Here, we tested the hypothesis that glaciers affect phytoplankton dynamics {{as early as the}} productive spring bloom period. During two campaigns in 2007 (late spring) and 2008 (early spring) we studied hydrographic characteristics and phytoplankton variability along 2 transects in both fjords, using HPLC-CHEMTAX pigment fingerprinting, molecular fingerprinting (DGGE) and sequencing of 18 S rRNA genes. The sheltered inner fjord locations remained colder during spring as opposed to the outer locations. Vertical light attenuation coefficients increased from early spring onwards, at all locations, but in particular at the inner locations. During the end of spring, meltwater input had stratified surface waters throughout the fjords. The inner fjord locations were characterized by overall lower phytoplankton biomass. Furthermore HPLC-CHEMTAX data revealed that diatoms and Phaeocystis sp. were replaced by small nano- and picophytoplankton during late spring, coinciding with low nutrient availability. The innermost stations showed higher relative abundances of nano- and picophytoplankton throughout, notably of cyanophytes and cryptophytes. Molecular fingerprinting revealed a high similarity between inner fjord samples from early spring and late spring samples from all locations, while outer samples from early spring clustered separately. We conclude that glacier influence, mediated by early meltwater input, modifies phytoplankton biomass and composition already during the spring bloom period, in favor of low biomass and small cell size communities. This may affect higher trophic levels especially when regional warming further increases the period and volume of meltwater...|$|R

40|$|The lower Miocene to Pleistocene at Sites 642 and 644 is {{subdivided}} into eight silicoflagellate zones and nine ebridian-actiniscidian zones. Due to the bioevents selected, the silicoflagellate zonation may be recognized in high {{northern and southern}} latitudes. A sequence of 24 diagnostic silicoflagellate, ebridian and actiniscidian events tied to absolute ages is established, and both the biozonations and the event sequence are correlated with standard nannoplankton zones and paleomagnetic anomalies. Based on fluctuations of cool and warm water-preferring silicoflagellate taxa, more than ten cooling phases of seasurface waters are recognized for the early Miocene to late Pliocene at Site 642. A relative paleotemperature curve derived from same data indicates that sea-surface temperatures were relatively high from 21. 7 to nearly 13. 4 Ma. Temperatures decreased progressively during the late Miocene until a distinct warm peak around 5. 45 Ma. During the Pliocene sea-surface temperatures were generally low and dropped drastically at about 3. 2 Ma, just before the final disappearance of silicoflagellates at Site 642 around 3. 1 Ma, probably corresponding to a brief glacial phase. At Site 644, silicoflagellates, ebridians, and actiniscidians persisted from 2. 8 until 2. 57 Ma, when abundances suddenly decreased {{with the onset of}} a substantial Northern Hemisphere glaciation. After an interval of disappearance from about 2. 5 to 2. 1 Ma, siliceous flagellates reappeared at Site 644 during several phases of warm-temperate <b>water</b> <b>incursions</b> from the North Atlantic. At about 1. 9 Ma ebridians disappeared at Site 644, and at 0. 74 Ma silicoflagellates and actiniscidians also disappeared.

40|$|This study {{documents}} {{the critical role}} of structurally-induced fluid flow during {{the evolution of the}} footwall succession to a major low-angle normal (detachment) fault, drilled by the Ocean Drilling Program leg 173, Site 1068 beneath the Southern Iberia Abyssal Plain. The fault zone comprises (carbonate-altered, rodingitized, and albitized) metabasite-rich sedimentary breccias and serpentinized mantle peridotites. The brittle infrastructure of the detachment consists of mineralized high dilation breccias, and meshes of mineralized extensional and shear veins, that root into chlorite and serpentine cataclasite, and gouge. The fault rocks are underlain by cohesive serpentinite that shows kernel textures, indicative of volume expansion accompanying serpentinization of peridotite. The texture is disrupted and offset by small-scale fractures and faults. The distribution of serpentine polytypes, carbonates, Fe^Ni alloys, sulfides, oxides, and other silicate phases, varies across the fault zone in patterns consistent with mineralization, and replacement, from solutions derived from two end member components: seawater, and CH 4 -bearing calciumhydroxide enriched hydrothermal solutions. The latter form when heated seawater reacts with peridotite to form serpentinite at low water to rock ratios. Serpentine mineral chemistries indicate that fracture-controlled serpentinite recrystallization and replacement occurred at various fO 2, aSiO 2 and Ca 2 þ conditions. In places this also involved mild prograde thermal events. The serpentinite also hosts tochilinite-valleriite group minerals and aragonite, both are interpreted as indicators of sea <b>water</b> <b>incursions</b> into {{the upper reaches of the}} detachment. To account for the evidence of coeval hydrothermal mineralization and displacements across the detachment we relate hydrothermal discharge to the buffering of high pore fluid pressures by fault slip. Localized sources of high fluid pressures at depth are attributed to serpentinization of peridotite around the fault that promotes changes to solution mass density, exothermic reactions and swelling pressures. Sealing of the fault between the serpentinization front and the top of the detachment results from hydrothermal mineralization, alteration, and serpentine gouges. Hydrothermal discharges from the detachment accompanying shear failure allow for variable mixing between the hydrothermal solutions and seawater, and post-slip convective draw down of seawater into the detachment. It is suggested that the latter may have been limited in duration by ongoing mineralization leading to the restoration of the fault seal. Concomitant serpentinization around the detachment at depth provides scope for cyclic hydrothermal discharges and fault slip...|$|R

40|$|Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) {{performed}} an operational events assessment of Fort St. Vrain (FSV) {{nuclear power plant}} during 1981 – 1989. As part of that assessment, the ORNL principal investigator filed 96 monthly reports detailing the results of each month’s analysis. This project reviewed those 96 monthly reports and identified pertinent operating experiences that occurred at FSV which may be applicable to current or future gas cooled reactor (GCR) designs. Two hundred seventy–nine events were catalogued into seven general categories: (1) <b>water</b> <b>incursion</b> events or failures of moisture detection systems; (2) air or other unwanted gas incursion events and failures of gas detection systems; (3) fuel failures or anomalies; (4) failures or cracks in graphite, pipes, and other reactor structural components; (5) failures of nuclear instrumentation systems; (6) human factors and operator performance issues; and (7) other events or conditions that may be relevant to current GCR designs. Several events were reviewed {{over a period of}} years and appeared in more than one monthly report. iii CONTENTS ABSTRACT [...] . ii...|$|E
40|$|The {{projected}} rise in {{sea level}} {{for the next century}} will have profound impacts on peri-urban agricultural production in the Yangtze delta area. This paper assesses the major impacts of the rise in sea level on coastal processes, flood hazards and saline <b>water</b> <b>incursion</b> in relation to sustainable development of peri-urban agriculture in the deltaic plain around Shanghai, People's Republic of China. It is concluded that the rise in sea level will cause coastal erosion along the southern coast and slow sedimentary accretion in a number of shoals within the Yangtze estuary. This change will severely limit the extent of intertidal flats available for land reclamation. The rise in sea level will also increase flood risk, raise the groundwater table and prolong waterlogging. Consequently, agricultural yields will be seriously reduced. During dry seasons, saline water will dominate the deltaic area for much longer periods and shortages of freshwater for agriculture are expected to be more pronounced. Four counter-measures have been adopted by the Shanghai Municipal Government in an attempt to mitigate the effects of sea-level rise. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
30|$|The 2 -D ERT {{sections}} along traverses 3 and 1 {{were taken}} {{perpendicular to the}} Lagoon to monitor the progressive seawater incursion to the neighbouring coastal aquifers. Resistivity distributions indicate salt <b>water</b> <b>incursion</b> from the lagoon extending {{to a depth of}} about 35  m (Traverse 1) and 45  m (Traverse 3) beneath the surface marked with very low resistivity value ranging from 0.3 – 10.0 Ωm. Ground surface under Traverse 1 from surface positions 60  m to 190  m was a sand-filled land reclaimed from lagoon prior to the erection of the University Guess House building. This was well noted during the field survey. This possibly accounts for the thick high resistive material display above the saline water intrusion zone in the resistivity structure (Figure  4 a). Pollution observed within the subsurface along this traverse was probably due to combination of saltwater incursion from the lagoon and waste water percolation into the subsurface along the drainage/waste water channel. But near surface high resistivity structure at isolated points (Figure  4 b) along the traverse was due to the existence of buried drainage/bridge/high resistivity exotic materials.|$|E
40|$|Coral {{habitats}} {{span the}} range from tropical to polar, extremely shallow {{to thousands of}} meters deep. The differences in light and temperature experienced in these varied habitats likely affect the metabolic rates of the corals residing there. The metabolism of three coral species from different habitats have been examined to elucidate {{the effects of these}} environmental parameters on metabolism, an under-studied aspect of coral biology. For all three species, measurements of oxygen uptake, ammonium excretion, and activity of the enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and citrate synthase (CS) were used to characterize their metabolism. Off Florida 2 ̆ 7 s Gulf coast, Cladocora arbuscula is known {{to be one of the}} species least damaged by bleaching events and is one of the quickest to recover, making it an ideal candidate for studying the effects of symbionts. The first set of experiments was designed to reveal the effect of disrupting the coral-algal symbiosis between this subtropical shallow-water coral and its dinoflagellate symbiont, Symbiodinium. The metabolic effects were described for 2 ̆ 2 normal 2 ̆ 2 C. arbuscula and those 2 ̆ 2 bleached 2 ̆ 2 by being held in total darkness for 4 months. Normal C. arbuscula had a relatively low rate of oxygen consumption at 21 °C, averaging 2. 43 ± 0. 65 µmol O 2 gwm- 1 h- 1 (±S. E.), using tissue wet mass, while the bleached colonies had an average rate of 2. 46 ± 0. 49 µmol O 2 gwm- 1 h- 1. Ammonium excretion averaged 0. 07 ± 0. 02 and 0. 10 ± 0. 03 µmol NH 4 + gwm- 1 h- 1 (±S. E.) for normal and bleached C. arbuscula, respectively. The activity values of the metabolic enzymes citrate synthase (CS) fell within the normal range expected for a cnidarian, averaging around 0. 09 ± 0. 02 activity units (U) gwm- 1 for both treatments, indicating normal aerobic ability. MDH was extremely high for the normal corals, compared to other cnidarians, averaging 2. 5 ± 0. 4 U gwm- 1, and a bit lower for the bleached corals, averaging 1. 2 ± 0. 3 U gwm- 1, indicating high MDH activity during both normoxia and hypoxia. LDH activity, also high, averaged 1. 3 ± 0. 2 U gwm- 1 for both treatments, indicating anaerobic competence. These experiments show that C. arbuscula is adept at maintaining almost completely normal metabolic function when bleached, although the corals quickly become re-inoculated with symbionts upon return to normal light conditions in a tank with normal corals. The second set of experiments served to characterize the metabolism of Lophelia pertusa, an azooxanthellate cold-water coral that thrives in water depths between 36 and 3383 m. L. pertusa is rather stenothermal, commonly found between 6 - 8 °C, but in the Gulf of Mexico can be subjected to warm <b>water</b> <b>incursions.</b> This makes it an ideal candidate for the examination of the effects of temperature. L. pertusa exhibited a respiration rate of 1. 14 µmol O 2 gwm- 1 h- 1 at the control temperature of 8 °C. Calculating the Q 10 for bringing L. pertusa up to the environmental temperature of C. arbuscula results in a value of 1. 8. The 11 °C treatment group exhibited an 11...|$|R
