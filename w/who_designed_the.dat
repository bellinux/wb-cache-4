5|$|After {{the turn}} of the 19th century, {{architecture}} developed into the late Baroque style.

5000|$|A {{software}} developer {{is a person}} concerned with facets of the software development process, including <b>the</b> research, <b>design,</b> programming, and testing of computer software. Other job titles which are often used with similar meanings are programmer, software analyst, and software engineer.According to developer Eric Sink, the differences between system design, software development, and programming are more apparent. Already in the current market place {{there can be found}} a segregation between programmers and developers, being that one who implements {{is not the same as}} <b>the</b> one <b>who</b> <b>designs</b> <b>the</b> class structure or hierarchy. Even more so that developers become systems architects, those <b>who</b> <b>design</b> <b>the</b> multi-leveled architecture or component interactions of a large software system.

Fading in and out, the music video ends with the girls combined together although they are at different places.|$|E
5|$|After 1912, when Skopje was annexed by Serbia, {{the city}} was {{drastically}} westernised. Wealthy Serbs built mansions and town houses such as the 1926 Ristiḱ Palace. Architecture of that time {{is very similar to}} the one of Central Europe, but some buildings are more creative, such as the Neo-Moorish Arab House and the Neo-Byzantine train station, both built in 1938. Modernism appeared as early as 1933 with the former Ethnographic Museum (today the City Gallery), designed by Milan Zloković. However, modernist architecture only fully developed in Skopje after the 1963 earthquake. The reconstruction of city centre was partially planned by Japanese Kenzo Tange <b>who</b> <b>designed</b> <b>the</b> new train station. Macedonian architects also took part to the reconstruction: Georgi Konstantinovski designed the City Archives building in 1968 and the Hall of residence Goce Delčev in 1975, while Janko Konstantinov designed the Telecommunication Centre and the main post office (1974–1989). Slavko Brezovski designed the Church of St. Clement of Ohrid. These two buildings are noted for their originality although they are directly inspired by brutalism.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{expected}} TV commercials during such TV hits as Friends and Law & Order, {{as well as}} one in {{the second}} quarter of Super Bowl XXXVII, there was also a tie-in with Kraft, an in-store promotion at Wal-Mart, a marketing campaign with Hamilton Watch Company, <b>who</b> <b>designed</b> <b>the</b> watch Matt wears in the film, and a weeklong Daredevil segment on Entertainment Tonight. As part of an online form of marketing, a viral e-mail drive was started, where participants would be entered in a contest where they could win prizes such as Daredevil T-shirts, Game Boy Advance games, and cufflinks. To enter the drawing, the user had to book tickets for the film online, then pass an e-mail on to someone else. The idea was to encourage online ticket booking, which at the time was seen as a growing trend. The Game Boy Advance Daredevil game was released on February 14, 2003, and was created by Encore, a subsidiary of Navarre Corporation. The soundtrack to the film, , was released in February 2003.|$|E
