Another, headed by Mark Oliphant, assisted <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electromagnetic separation process at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Cockcroft became the director of the joint British-Canadian Montreal Laboratory. A British mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory was led by Chadwick, and later Peierls, which included several of Britain's most eminent scientists. As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership, and ensured that British participation was complete and wholehearted.|$|E

County borders were kept largely intact, with few adjustments, and the total number of counties was raised to 71; this lasted until the beginning of World War II.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} years of World WarII, Australia's {{military}} strategy was closely aligned <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom. In line with this, most Australian military units deployed overseas in 1940 and 1941 were sent to the Mediterranean and Middle East where they formed {{a key part of the}} Commonwealth forces in the area. The three AIF infantry divisions sent to the Middle East saw extensive action, as did the RAAF squadrons and warships in this theatre.|$|E

5|$|Flamininus first sent an {{envoy to}} Sparta, {{demanding}} that Nabis either surrender Argos to the Achaean League or face war with Rome and her Greek allies.

5|$|General Friedrich Fromm, {{commander-in-chief}} of the Reserve (or Replacement) Army (Ersatzheer) and Stauffenberg's immediate superior, was one {{of those}} implicated in the conspiracy. Hitler removed Fromm from his post and named Himmler as his successor. Since the Reserve Army consisted of two million men, Himmler hoped to draw on these reserves to fill posts within the Waffen-SS. He appointed Hans Jüttner, director of the SS Leadership Main Office, as his deputy, and began to fill top Reserve Army posts with SS men. By November 1944 Himmler had merged the army officer recruitment department <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Waffen-SS and had successfully lobbied for an increase in the quotas for recruits to the SS.|$|E
5|$|Having first {{established}} {{themselves in}} the West Coast third wave ska scene, the Daddies ultimately broke into the musical mainstream with their 1997 swing compilation Zoot Suit Riot. Released {{at the onset of}} the late 1990s swing revival, Zoot Suit Riot sold over two million copies in the United States while its eponymous single became a radio hit, launching the Daddies to the forefront of the neo-swing movement. By the end of the decade, however, the Daddies' mainstream popularity declined <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> swing revival's, and the resulting commercial failure of their ska-flavored follow-up Soul Caddy led to an abrupt hiatus in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{supporting}} {{characters have}} been cited as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with strength of character and depth of personality, which has been compared <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters of Charles Dickens. Hergé used the supporting characters to create a realistic world in which to set his protagonists' adventures. To further the realism and continuity, characters would recur throughout the series. The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. As a result, the colourful supporting cast was developed during this period.|$|E

In North Africa, the Eurasian species is again found at a higher level. The separation by altitude and aridity means {{that it is not}} known whether the closely related Ptyonoprogne martins could hybridise.

5|$|John Neville's {{upbringing}} and carer was entwined <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{north of}} England and specifically, the marcher areas, {{the eastern and}} western borders between Scotland and England, controlled from Berwick and Carlisle respectively. His Early activity there consisted of diplomatic meetings with the Scots, at which he acted as a witness, between 1449 and 1451. He {{was also one of}} three men who were instructed, in a letter of 3 February 1449, to not attend the forthcoming parliament and remain in the north guarding the border. He was knighted by King Henry VI at Greenwich on 5 January 1453, alongside Edmund and Jasper Tudor, his brother Thomas Neville, William Herbert, Roger Lewknor, and William Catesby.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October 1941, President Roosevelt {{approved}} the atomic program after he convened {{a meeting with}} Vannevar Bush and Vice President Henry A. Wallace. To control the program, he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself—although he never attended a meeting—Wallace, Bush, Conant, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George C. Marshall. Roosevelt chose the Army to run the project rather than the Navy, because the Army had more experience with management of large-scale construction projects. He also agreed to coordinate the effort <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British, and on 11 October he {{sent a message to}} Prime Minister Winston Churchill, suggesting that they correspond on atomic matters.|$|E

5|$|Shakespeare {{influenced}} novelists such as Thomas Hardy, William Faulkner, and Charles Dickens. The American novelist Herman Melville's soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick is {{a classic}} tragic hero, inspired by King Lear. Scholars have identified 20,000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare's works. These include two operas by Giuseppe Verdi, Otello and Falstaff, whose critical standing compares <b>with</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> source plays. Shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the Romantics and the Pre-Raphaelites. The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli, a friend of William Blake, even translated Macbeth into German. The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology, in particular, that of Hamlet, for his theories of human nature.|$|E
