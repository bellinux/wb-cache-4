5|$|Tension {{came to a}} head on New Year's Eve of 1958, when Atlas {{ordered an}} all-out attack on Ryan. The battle left many dead, and the few sane {{survivors}} barricaded themselves away. <b>What</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> a beautiful utopia had fallen into a crumbling dystopia. Some of the events described above are revisited and expanded upon in the downloadable expansion , which takes place in Rapture during the latter months of 1958 and leads up to Atlas' assault on Ryan's forces.|$|E
5|$|A few of {{the roads}} {{surrounding}} the area that was Monte Ne {{on the edge of}} Beaver Lake have names reflecting <b>what</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> there. Highway 94, which once led to Monte Ne, is also called Monte Ne Road. Country Road 1195, which runs along the lake, is also called Pyramid Street and is a few hundred feet from where the Pyramid would have stood. Similarly Canal Street is nearby, named for the waterways that Harvey's gondolas once traveled. Other roads close by include Oklahoma Drive, Vinda Drive, and Monte Ne Estates Drive.|$|E
25|$|Others {{dispute the}} {{importance}} of consumption over income, pointing out that if middle and lower income are consuming more than they earn {{it is because they}} are saving less or going deeper into debt. Income inequality has been the driving factor in the growing household debt, as high earners bid up the price of real estate and middle income earners go deeper into debt trying to maintain <b>what</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> a middle class lifestyle.|$|E

25|$|The once {{very large}} spring gushed from the {{limestone}} cave, but an earthquake moved {{it to the}} foot of the natural terrace where it now seeps quietly from the bedrock, with a greatly reduced flow.

50|$|The Apidium {{species were}} well adapted {{to life in}} <b>what</b> <b>once</b> <b>were</b> the {{tropical}} forests of North Africa.

These primates appear to have been frugivorous and diurnal, with keen eyesight.|$|R
25|$|Geologists Carpenter and Russell studied Devils Tower in {{the late}} 19th century {{and came to the}} {{conclusion}} that it was formed by an igneous intrusion. Modern geologists agree that it was formed by the intrusion of igneous material, but not on exactly how that process took place. Several believe the molten rock comprising the Tower might not have surfaced; others are convinced the tower is all that remains of <b>what</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> a large explosive volcano.|$|E
25|$|In {{a reality}} where villains have won and divided up America amongst themselves, Emma Frost marries Doctor Doom {{in order to}} ensure the {{survival}} of her species. Together with Doctor Doom, they rule a sector of <b>what</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> the United States of America called Doom's Lair, the only place on Earth where mutants can live without fear of persecution. She sends her lover Black Bolt to save Logan and Hawkeye from a Venom-possessed Savage Land Tyrannosaurus. Emma uses her telepathy to make herself look young.|$|E
25|$|A {{physicist}} {{by training}} {{and a former}} environment minister, Merkel understood what Fukushima meant. Germany has 17 reactors, providing 23 percent of the electrical power {{in the country and}} making it the sixth largest nuclear electricity producer in the world. The eight oldest reactors were taken off the grid within days of 3/11 and will not return to operation. In record time, <b>what</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> the most pro-nuclear German government in decades prepared comprehensive legislation to phase out the remaining nine reactors by 2022 at the latest, starting in 2015. In June, parliament overwhelmingly passed the law (513 in favor, 79 against, 8 abstentions).|$|E

25|$|The upper {{portion of}} the {{mountain}} {{is made up of}} volcanic and sedimentary deposits of <b>what</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> one or more island arcs of the Farallon Plate dating back to the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, between 90 and 190 million years ago. During this time, the Farallon Plate was subducting beneath the North American continent. These deposits were scraped off the top and accreted onto the North American Plate. This resulted in the highly distorted and fractured basalt and serpentine of the Mount Diablo Ophiolite and metasediments of the Franciscan complex around the summit. East of the subduction zone, a basin was filling with sediment from the ancestral Sierra further to the east. Up to 60,000 feet (18,000 m) of sandstone, mudstone, and limestone of the Great Valley Sequence were deposited from 66 to 150 million years ago. These deposits are now found faulted against the Ophiolite and Franciscan deposits.|$|E
25|$|After the 1990–91 season, {{the rivalry}} would die down as {{players from the}} Oilers would move to other teams. Jari Kurri and Charlie Huddy would rejoin Gretzky on the Kings and go on a playoff run to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1993, losing to Montreal in five games. Mark Messier, Glenn Anderson, Adam Graves, Craig MacTavish, and others would move to the New York Rangers and go on a Stanley Cup winning run in 1994. Furthermore, the two Pacific Division teams have not met in the playoffs since 1992, nor have been {{regularly}} competitive at the same time, thus keeping <b>what</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> an intense divisional rivalry dormant. When the Oilers {{made it to the}} Stanley Cup Finals in 2006 (losing to the Carolina Hurricanes in seven games), the Kings failed to make the playoffs. For the next ten years after their playoff run, Edmonton did not make a postseason appearance, while Los Angeles won the Cup in 2012 and 2014.|$|E
25|$|Environmental devastation in Uzbekistan is best {{exemplified}} by the catastrophe of the Aral Sea. Because of diversion of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya for cotton cultivation and other purposes, <b>what</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> the world's fourth largest inland sea has shrunk in {{the past thirty years}} to only about one-third of its 1960 volume and less than half its 1960 geographical size. The desiccation and salinization of the lake have caused extensive storms of salt and dust from the sea's dried bottom, wreaking havoc on the region's agriculture and ecosystems and on the population's health. Desertification has led to the large-scale loss of plant and animal life, loss of arable land, changed climatic conditions, depleted yields on the cultivated land that remains, and destruction of historical and cultural monuments. Every year, many tons of salts reportedly are carried as far as 800 kilometers away. Regional experts assert that salt and dust storms from the Aral Sea have raised the level of particulate matter in the Earth's atmosphere by more than 5%, seriously affecting global climate change.|$|E

500|$|Since the Bare Boys {{purchases}} {{were legal}} at the time, {{they did not}} prove {{that he was willing}} to break the law to acquire such materials. [...] "... (E)vidence that merely indicates a generic inclination to act within a broad range, not all of which is criminal, is of little probative value in establishing predisposition", he wrote. [...] "Evidence of predisposition to do <b>what</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> lawful is not, by itself, sufficient to show predisposition to do what is now illegal, for there is a common understanding that most people obey the law even when they disapprove of it". He also noted that, at trial, the prosecution had not challenged Jacobson's assertion that he did not know the magazines would contain pictures of minors until he received it.|$|E
500|$|Dr. R. Cecil Gentry {{became the}} {{director}} of Stormfury in 1968. [...] There were no more near-seedings until 1969. In the interim, equipment was improved. <b>What</b> <b>once</b> <b>was</b> the primitive method of hand-dumping dry ice was replaced with rocket canisters loaded with silver iodide, and then gun-like devices mounted {{on the wings of}} the airplanes that fired silver iodide into the clouds. Observation equipment was improved. Additional reconnaissance data was utilized to modify the working hypothesis. The new theory took cumulus towers outside the eyewall into account. According to the revised theory, by seeding the towers, latent heat would be released. This would trigger the start of new convection, which would then cause a new eyewall. Since the new eyewall was outside the original one, the first eyewall would be choked of energy and fall apart. In addition, since the new eyewall was broader than the old one, the winds would be lower due to a less sharp pressure difference.|$|E

2500|$|The second, {{and most}} significant, round of refit and {{expansion}} {{took place in}} 1680–83.

On 18 April 2010, ISI's two top leaders, al-Masri and Omar al-Baghdadi, were killed in a joint US-Iraqi raid near Tikrit. In a press conference in June 2010, General Odierno reported that 80% of ISI's top 42 leaders, including recruiters and financiers, had been killed or captured, with only eight remaining at large. He said that they had been cut off from al-Qaeda's leadership in Pakistan.|$|E
