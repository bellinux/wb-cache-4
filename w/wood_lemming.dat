50|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>lemming</b> (Myopus schisticolor) is {{a species}} of rodents in the family Cricetidae. It belongs to the Arvicolinae {{subfamily}} of rodents, so is a relative of the voles, lemmings, and muskrats.It {{is found in the}} taiga biome of China, Finland, Mongolia, Norway, Russia, and Sweden.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>lemming</b> Myopus schisticolor, the Arctic lemming, Dicrostonyx torquatus, and {{multiple}} {{species in the}} grass mouse genus Akodon have evolved fertile females who possess the genotype generally coding for males, XY, {{in addition to the}} ancestral XX female, through a variety of modifications to the X and Y chromosomes.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>lemming</b> is well {{adapted to}} live in cold climates due to its high thermogenic capacity, thermal insulation, and nonshivering thermogenesis.

40|$|I used video {{monitoring}} to study diet and prey delivery rate of six breeding pairs of the Eurasian kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) in Trysil, south eastern Norway, during the breeding season 2011. A total of 284 prey items of 9 species were recorded {{delivered at the}} kestrel nests. The abundance of small mammals was estimated in each kestrel territory. Voles were the most abundant prey delivered at the nests. The kestrels showed a functional response to Microtus voles (Field vole (Microtus agrestis) and Root vole (Microtus oeconomus) pooled), but not to bank vole or <b>wood</b> <b>lemming.</b> This suggests that Microtus voles were preferred prey for the kestrels. <b>Wood</b> <b>lemming</b> was an alternative prey to Microtus voles, while bank vole had a negative, but insignificant trend. Birds or common lizard was not alternative prey to Microtus voles. Studies on predation on <b>wood</b> <b>lemming</b> by kestrels are rare, and I suggest that wood lemmings are caught only when the abundance of <b>wood</b> <b>lemming</b> is high and the abundance of Microtus voles is low. Common lizard were more frequently delivered between 9 am and 1 pm, and {{the probability of a}} bird being delivered at kestrel nests increased with solar height. The probability that a prey delivered at the nest was a <b>wood</b> <b>lemming</b> increased throughout the day, and was twice as high in the evening than in the morning. This may suggest that the <b>wood</b> <b>lemming</b> is more active in the evening and therefore more vulnerable to hunting kestrels, or may be mistaken for a Microtus vole as the daylight fades away.

40|$|The late metaphase-early {{anaphase}} {{cells from}} various tissues of male Mus musculus, M. poschiavinus, M. spretus, M. castaneus, {{female and male}} Bos taurus (cattle) and female Myopus schisticolor (<b>wood</b> <b>lemming)</b> were analyzed for centromeres that showed separation into two daughter centromeres and those that did not show such separation. In all strains and species of mouse the Y chromosome {{is the first one}} to separate, as is the X or Y in the cattle. These sex chromosomes are devoid of constitutive heterochromatin, whereas all autosomes in these species carry detectable quantities. In cattle, the late replicating X chromosome appears to separate later than the active X. In the <b>wood</b> <b>lemming</b> the three pairs of autosomes with the least amount of centromeric constitutive heterochromatin separate first. These are followed by the separation of seven pairs of autosomes carrying medium amounts of constitutive heterochromatin. Five pairs of autosomes with the largest amounts of constitutive heterochromatin are the last in the sequence of separation. The sex chromosomes with medium amounts of constitutive heterochromatin around the centromere, and a very large amount of distal heterochromatin, separate among the very late ones but are not the last. These observations assign a specific role to centromeric constitutive heterochromatin and also indicate that nonproximal heterochromatin does not exert control over the sequence in which the centromeres in the genome separate. It appears that qualitative differences among various types of constitutive heterochromatin are as important as quantitative differences in controlling the separation of centromeres...|$|E
40|$|A {{suspension}} of free testicular cells {{were obtained by}} mild trypsin treatment from newborn BALB/c testes, and their plasma membrane H-Y antigen sites were blocked (lysostripped) by an excess of H-Y antibody of proven specificity and potency (45 min in ice). Upon 16 h of the Moscona-type rotation culture, these treated testicular cells yielded primarily spherical aggregates, {{more than half of}} which demonstrated a strong resemblance to ovarian follicles. The resemblance was particularly striking between the smallest testicular folliculoids and primordial ovarian follicles that abound in the newborn female gonad. Under the same condition, control serum-treated testicular cells primarily yielded cylindrical tubular structures that can be very long. Over a critical range, concentrations of H-Y antibody apparently influenced the frequency of testicular folliculoid formation. The above directly supports the proposed testis-organizing function of H-Y antigen and is certainly compatible with the genetic situation encountered in the <b>wood</b> <b>lemming</b> (Myopus schisticolor), that in the functional absence of H-Y antigen, XY gonadal cells readily organize an ovary...|$|E

A long-term {{study of the}} winter food niche of the pine marten Martes martes in northern boreal Finland. Acta Theriologica 41 : 337 - 352. The diet of the pine marten Martes martes (Linnaeus, 1758) was studied during 16 successive winters in an uninhabited area in northern boreal Finland. The results are based on 5677 scats analyzed. The present data support earlier findings that the pine marten is an opportunistic generalist, its most favoured food apparently being small rodents, especially Clethrionomys spp. The significant year-to-year variation {{in the frequency of}} occurrence of this favoured prey in the diet of the marten correlated positively with summer trapping numbers for these species. Snow cover decreased the martens ' consumption of Microtus spp. but not Clethrionomys spp. or the <b>wood</b> <b>lemming</b> Myopus schisticolor.

40|$|Prey {{handling}} behaviour {{is important}} for prey selection, but are poorly known for raptors. Therefore, selection and handling of prey by European kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) was studied by observing prey transfer outside the nest and by video monitoring prey delivery and prey handling in the nest. Of the prey items recorded delivered by the kestrels to their nests, voles were {{by far the most}} abundant prey by number and mass, followed by birds, shrews and then lizards (Zootoca vivipara). Insects and frogs were rare. The delivery rate of each of the four types of small mammal prey (shrews, bank vole, Microtus voles and <b>wood</b> <b>lemming)</b> increased with increasing abundance of the same prey type around the nest as assessed by snap trapping. The delivery rate of avian prey declined with increasing vole abundance, as did also the delivery rate of shrews, whereas the delivery rate of lizards declined with increasing shrew abundance and increased with increasing mean daily temperature. The probability that a prey item delivered at the nest was a lizard, rather than another prey type, increased towards midday, and also increased with increasing ambient temperature. Thus, the kestrels´ capture of lizards may be regarded as a functional response, where the availability of lizards is determined by solar height and ambient temperature. Mates captured prey of the same size. Females apparently delivered larger prey at the nest, but this was an artefact caused by the fact that males selectively delivered smaller prey directly to the nestlings and larger prey to the female for further processing and finally feeding of the nestlings. The probability of a prey item being decapitated prior to delivery at the nest increased with prey body mass for voles and birds, and decreased with nestling age for voles, but not for birds. No lizard and very few shrews were decapitated prior to delivery. In an average brood each nestling was estimated to consume 67. 8 g-d. Daily rate of prey mass delivered was highly associated with nestling age, with a maximum occurring when the nestlings were 17 days old, which was close to the predicted age of 15 days when the growth of the nestlings settled down. For a given type of prey, the variation in handling time was explained by prey body mass. Larger items were ingested at a higher rate than smaller prey when the female fed nestlings, but not when the nestlings became able to feed unassisted. Taken together, during the second week after hatching, when kestrel nestlings become able to feed on small prey unassisted, smaller prey become more profitable than larger prey, and should thus be included when providing the nestlings. However, the benefits of smaller prey items have to exceed the potential cost of dominant nestlings monopolizing small prey and the cost of keeping up a high feeding rate. The kestrel may select different prey depending on whether the prey is intended for self-feeding or for provisioning nestlings, where it would be more profitable to self-feed on small prey and provision dependent nestlings with larger prey...|$|E
