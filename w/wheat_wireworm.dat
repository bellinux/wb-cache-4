50|$|Flea beetles do {{not survive}} in the {{northern}} half of Illinois due to low winter temperatures. Those found in late spring or summer have migrated from the south. Snow or other winter cover apparently provides insufficient shelter to enhance survival of the overwintering flea beetles. Prolonged periods of wet summer weather are unfavorable for beetle multiplication and feeding, while dry weather is favorable. Consequently, although this disease has been found throughout the world, the bacterium has never survived and spread other than in North America, because the disease depends on where C. pulicaria occurs. In North America, Stewart’s wilt {{is found in the}} mid-Atlantic and the Ohio River Valley regions and in the southern portion of the Corn Belt. This region includes parts of Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, and West Virginia. Stewart’s wilt can also be found in eastern and midwestern states and portions of Canada, but this depends on whether or not the corn flea beetles survive the winters. Corn flea beetles can transmit the bacteria northward during the summer, but if the insect vectors cannot survive the harsh winter temperatures, then the bacteria cannot be spread. The toothed flea beetle, adult 12-spotted cucumber beetle, seed corn maggot, <b>wheat</b> <b>wireworm,</b> white grubs, and larvae of corn rootworms can also carry P. stewartii from one plant to another during the summer. These pests cannot overwinter and transmit this disease.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{bulletin}} is to enable farmers {{to distinguish between the}} different kinds of wireworms, so that they can make use of the methods shown to be best in the control of each [...] The species here treated are the <b>wheat</b> <b>wireworm</b> of the Northeastern and Middle Western States, the corn wireworms of the Middle Atlantic and New England States and the Mississippi Valley, the meadow wireworms (including the sugar-beet wireworm and the confused wireworm), the corn and cotton wireworm of the Southern States, and the dry-land wireworm and inflated wireworm of the dry-farming region of the Northwest and the wheat regions of the Northern Middle West.
