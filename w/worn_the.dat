5|$|After the {{revolution}} was quelled, the old flags were restored and {{the revolution}}aries punished for having <b>worn</b> <b>the</b> tricolor. In 1849, domnitor Barbu Dimitrie Ştirbei adopted a new design for military colors that nevertheless preserved the colors’ horizontal layout and only changed decorative elements. Similar to the 1834 flag, this one lasted until 1856.|$|E

5|$|Body piercing, {{a form of}} body modification, is the {{practice}} of puncturing or cutting {{a part of the}} human body, creating an opening in which jewelry may be <b>worn.</b> <b>The</b> word piercing can refer to the act or practice of body piercing, or to an opening in the body created by this act or practice.

5|$|In 1888, Darlington's kit {{consisted}} of a shirt with black and white vertical stripes, black shorts and black socks. Apart from a period between the 1910s and 1936, when blue shorts were <b>worn,</b> <b>the</b> basic colours of the home kit have remained black and white. The shirt design has varied, from the 1888 vertical stripes, through hoops, plain white, and back to hoops again in the 1990s. Sponsors' names have appeared on Darlington's shirts since the 1980s. A table of kit manufacturers (since the 1970s) and shirt sponsors appears on the right.|$|E

5|$|Regardless {{of which}} story is true, {{the red and}} white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have <b>worn</b> <b>the</b> {{combination}} ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours {{at the start of}} the next season. In the 2008–09 season, Arsenal replaced the traditional all-white sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe.|$|E

5|$|The Calgary Flames {{have retired}} two numbers, {{and a third}} was retired league-wide. The Flames retired #9 in honour of Lanny McDonald who played right wing for the Flames from 1981 to 1989, winning the Stanley Cup as the Flames captain in his final year. Mike Vernon's #30 is also retired; he was a goaltender with the Flames for {{fourteen}} years, from 1982–94 and 2000-02. Also out of circulation is the number 99 which was retired league-wide for Wayne Gretzky on February 6, 2000.

5|$|A small parrot ulna {{found on}} the Folle Anse archaeological site on Marie-Galante, {{an island in the}} Guadeloupe region, was {{assigned}} to the Lesser Antillean macaw by the ornithologists Matthew Williams and David Steadman in 2001. In 2008, the ornithologists Storrs Olson and Edgar Maíz López cast doubt upon this identification, and proposed that the bone instead belonged to the extant imperial amazon (Amazona imperialis). The size and robustness of the bone was similar to ulnae of the imperial amazon, and though it was <b>worn,</b> <b>the</b> authors identified {{what appeared to be a}} notch, which is also present on ulnae of the genus Amazona, but not in the genus Ara. Subfossil remains from the island of Montserrat have also been suggested to belong to the Lesser Antillean macaw. The species was recognized by Birdlife International and the IUCN Red List until 2013, but was not considered valid thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Chinese Ming style {{clothing}} was forced on Vietnamese {{people by the}} Nguyễn dynasty. The tunics and trouser clothing of the Han Chinese on the Ming and Qing tradition was worn by the Vietnamese. However, Han-Chinese clothing is assembled by several pieces of clothing including both pants and skirts called Qun (裙) or chang (裳) which {{is a part of}} Hanfu garments throughout the history of Han Chinese clothing. The Ao Dai was created when tucks which were close fitting and compact were added in the 1920s to this Chinese style. The Chinese clothing in the form of trousers and tunic were mandated by the Vietnamese Nguyen government. It was up to the 1920s in Vietnam's north area in isolated hamlets where skirts were <b>worn.</b> <b>The</b> Chinese Ming dynasty, Tang dynasty, and Han dynasty {{clothing was}} referred to be adopted by Vietnamese military and bureaucrats by the Nguyen Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát (Nguyen The Tong). Chinese clothing started influencing Vietnamese dress in the Ly dynasty. The current Ao Dai was introduced by the Nguyen Lords.|$|E
5|$|Juventus {{have played}} {{in black and white}} striped shirts, with white shorts, {{sometimes}} black shorts since 1903. Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them. Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin. Juventus have <b>worn</b> <b>the</b> shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.|$|E

For the same reason, Walter Pedraza, second in the {{mountains}} classification and Nicolas Roche, third in the combination classification (second-placed Dumoulin already <b>wore</b> <b>the</b> green jersey), <b>wore</b> <b>the</b> polka dot jersey and the white jersey respectively.|$|R
5|$|In stage two, Alexander Kristoff, who {{was second}} in <b>the</b> points {{classification}}, <b>wore</b> <b>the</b> green jersey, because Marcel Kittel <b>wore</b> <b>the</b> yellow jersey {{as leader of the}} general classification during that stage.

5|$|Leopard Trek {{came to the}} Tour de France with, per season-long expectations, a squad {{centered}} around overall victory. The leader was probably Andy Schleck, entering as runner-up {{in the past two}} Tours de France and three-times running winner of the young rider classification, an award for which he was no longer eligible. Brother Fränk said his goal was to have Andy win the Tour, with Fränk himself also there on the podium with him. The remaining squad members were Cancellara, Gerdemann, Monfort, Fuglsang, Voigt, O'Grady, and Posthuma. Every rider on the squad had ridden the Tour de France before, and all but Monfort, Fuglsang, and Posthuma had previously <b>worn</b> <b>the</b> yellow jersey. Pre-race analysis speculated Cancellara could aim for a few days in the race lead before the course shifted to the high mountains.|$|E
5|$|Ten months later, {{she became}} editor of US Vogue. Under Mirabella, {{it had become}} more focused on lifestyles {{as a whole and}} less on fashion. Industry {{insiders}} worried that it was losing ground to the recently introduced American edition of Elle. After making sweeping changes in staff, she changed the style of the cover pictures. Mirabella had preferred tight head shots of well-known models in studios; Wintour's covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those Diana Vreeland had done years earlier. She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with high fashion: the first issue she was in charge of, November 1988, featured a Peter Lindbergh photograph of 19-year-old Michaela Bercu in a $50 pair of faded jeans and a bejeweled jacket by Christian Lacroix worth $10,000. It was the first time a Vogue cover model had worn jeans (Bercu was originally supposed to have <b>worn</b> <b>the</b> skirt that coordinated with the jacket, but she had gained some weight and it didn't fit).|$|E
5|$|The France {{national}} team's record appearance-maker as captain is Didier Deschamps, who led {{the team}} out 52 times during his 103-cap tenure, which lasted through three decades. Deschamps {{is also the most}} successful France captain, having <b>worn</b> <b>the</b> armband, an indicator of the team's captain, in team victories at the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000. The Bayonne-born midfielder surpassed the previous record-holder of the France captaincy, midfielder Michel Platini, in the team's semi-final match at the latter competition. Platini became the first France captain to win a major international competition after leading the team in the 1984 European Football Championship. Aside from Deschamps and Platini, only two other players have captained France over 40 occasions, defenders Roger Marche and Marcel Desailly. Marche is one of two French captains to lead the team at two FIFA World Cup competitions. Desailly captained the team to victories at the 2001 and 2003 editions of the FIFA Confederations Cup. He is one of four players to be sent off in a FIFA World Cup final; one of the other three being fellow France captain Zinedine Zidane.|$|E
