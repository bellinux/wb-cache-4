5|$|Keynesian {{economics}} were officially discarded by the British Government in 1979, but {{forces had}} begun to gather against Keynes's ideas over 30 years earlier. Friedrich Hayek had formed the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, with the explicit intention of nurturing intellectual currents to one day displace Keynesianism and other similar influences. Its members included the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises along with the then young Milton Friedman. Initially the society had little impact on the wider world – according to Hayek it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Keynes had been raised to sainthood after his death and that people refused to allow his work to be questioned.|$|E

25|$|Berlioz {{continued}} to travel throughout his stay in Italy. He visited Pompeii, Naples, Milan, Tivoli, Florence, Turin and Genoa. Italy {{was important in}} providing Berlioz with experiences that would be impossible in France.

25|$|The di Marcos are now deemed as {{something}} of a failure for EastEnders. Since their departure, the family has even been mocked in an EastEnders official book, entitled EastEnders 20 Years In Albert Square. In the book, the author, Rupert Smith, writes :"Nobody really knew {{what to do with the}} di Marco family, who had been languishing in the pizza restaurant without a decent storyline between them. Finally, there was nothing else for it: the di Marcos would have to go. All of them…it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they'd never been".|$|E

Seriously ill from AIDS at the time, Charleson died seven weeks after his last performance. Fellow actor and friend, Sir Ian McKellen, said that Charleson played Hamlet so well it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had rehearsed the role all his life, and the performance garnered other major accolades as well, some even calling it the definitive Hamlet performance.|$|E
25|$|Color field, curiously {{enough or}} perhaps not, became a viable way of {{painting}} {{at exactly the}} time that acrylic paint, the new plastic paint, came into being. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the new paint demanded a new possibility in painting, and the painters arrived at it. Oil paint, which has a medium that is quite different, which isn't water-based, always leaves a slick of oil, or puddle of oil, {{around the edge of}} the color. Acrylic paint stops at its own edge. Color field painting came in at the same time as the invention of this new paint.|$|E

25|$|Loevy's next {{documentary}} film, Letters in the Wind (2001), was {{a tribute}} to noted Israeli actor Yossi Banai, one of the country's most noted performers and scion of a well-established theatrical family. Banai was particularly close to Nisim Aloni, whose plays featured prominently in Loevy's early films, {{and he was also}} close friends with Yaakov Shabtai (Crowned) and Hanoch Levin (The Child Dreams), two artists whose work Loevy also adapted for the screen. By making this film about Banai, it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Loevy had captured the artistic pulse of an entire generation that had dominated Israeli theater.|$|E
25|$|The most {{striking}} and thorough reform {{imposed by the}} General Velasco's government was to eliminate all large private landholdings, converting most of them into cooperatives owned by prior workers on the estates. The reform was intended to destroy the basis of power of Peru's traditional elite and to foster a more cooperative society {{as an alternative to}} capitalism. Such socialpolitical purposes apparently dominated questions of agricultural production or any planned changes in patterns of land use. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the questions of ownership were what mattered, not the consequences for output or rural incomes. In fact, the government soon created a system of price controls and monopoly food buying by state firms designed to hold down prices to urban consumers, no matter what the cost to rural producers.|$|E
25|$|The unified {{view of the}} battlespace {{provided}} by the Dowding system turned the tables in favour of the defence. By rapidly sending accurate, timely information to the fighters, their ability to find and attack the enemy was dramatically increased, and {{the time required to}} do so decreased. The fighters took off, flew directly to their targets, engaged and returned directly to their bases. In early operations interception rates of 75% were routine, and this number continued to improve as the operators became more familiar with their tasks. By the end of the Battle of Britain, rates of interception over 90% were becoming common, and several raids were met with 100% interception rates. In numerical terms, it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Fighter Command had over twice as many fighters, giving them effective parity with the Luftwaffe.|$|E

25|$|Asher's scars are {{hesitant}} {{around the}} face and groin, noted by Anita that it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the Priests flinched at the destruction of such beauty. The Priests (never said which denomination, but it is assumed Catholic) used Holy Water {{in an attempt to}} save Asher's soul (from what is never said, either). Asher is moody with a sadistic mean streak, lashing out at everyone in his fits of melancholic pain. He wants most to be loved and devoted by Jean-Claude, more a lover of men than women. Asher knows that it is through Anita's attraction to him combined with Jean-Claude's that Jean-Claude returns the love. Without Anita's acceptance, Jean-Claude could never bring himself to nearly be consumed for want of Asher again. That coupled with the incident of Asher nearly bleeding Anita to death during their first and only exclusive sexual experience leads to Asher's emotional neglect. Neither Anita nor Jean-Claude trust themselves alone with Asher, but as a trio, they live in nearly perfect love.|$|E
25|$|He {{worked with}} great rapidity and long hours, but {{he used his}} colours thin and covered the canvas with innumerable coats of paint. The colours {{increased}} in depth and intensity as the work progressed. At first the entire figure was painted in greyish-brown tones, with very little flesh colour, the whole blending perfectly with the greyish-brown of the prepared canvas; then the entire background would be intensified a little; then the figure made a little stronger; then the background, and so on {{from day to day}} and week to week, and often from month to month.... And so the portrait would really grow, really develop as an entirety, very much as a negative under the action of the chemicals comes out gradually—light, shadows, and all from the very first faint indications to their full values. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the portrait were hidden within the canvas and the master by passing his wands day after day over the surface evoked the image.|$|E

Craig was successful in having the Department of Corrections created, which he used to implement most of his penal reform. The Uniform Traffic Code was also established, which standardized road signs, speed limits, and traffic rules across the state. Funding was also granted to improve safety by installing signage and signal lights around the state. The police academy was expanded and the first narcotics group. The state police force was expanded to add fifty new officers, making it {{the largest in the}} nation at the time. The state's Mental Health Division was also established to reform the state's mental hospitals.|$|E

25|$|On {{the third}} day, Bhishma {{arranged}} the Kaurava {{forces in the}} formation of an eagle with himself leading from the front, while Duryodhana's forces protected the rear. Bhishma wanted to be sure of avoiding any mishap. The Pandavas countered this by using the crescent formation with Bhima and Arjuna {{at the head of the}} right and the left horns, respectively. The Kauravas concentrated their attack on Arjuna's position. Arjuna's chariot was soon covered with arrows and javelins. Arjuna, with amazing skill, built a fortification around his chariot with an unending stream of arrows from his bow. Abhimanyu and Satyaki combined to defeat the Gandhara forces of Shakuni. Bhima and his son Ghatotkacha attacked Duryodhana in the rear. Bhima's arrows hit Duryodhana, who swooned in his chariot. His charioteer immediately drove them out of danger. Duryodhana's forces, however, saw their leader fleeing the battlefield and soon scattered. Bhishma soon restored order and Duryodhana returned to lead the army. He was angry at Bhishma, however, at what he saw as leniency towards the five Pandava brothers and spoke harshly at his commander. Bhishma, stung by this unfair charge, fell on the Pandava army with renewed vigor. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> there were more than one Bhishma on the field.|$|E
25|$|Head faced his {{debilitating}} illness with a {{great degree}} of heroism. As Dr.George Riddoch wrote:When his final work on aphasia was finished we discussed the situation together. With his practical philosophy he accepted it at once, and his amazing power of adaptation enabled him to plan the rearrangement of his life. With his excellent general health he well knew {{what he had to}} face — long years of steadily increasing physical disablement, with his mind unimpaired except in its capacity for continuous effort; {{in the grip of a}} relentless foe which medical science could not restrain. Without a word of self-pity, with distress only for his devoted wife's heavy burden, he set himself in his methodical way to make his plans, and nothing was omitted. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he was dealing with one of his own patients. His attitude of mind, as always, was constructive and never defeatist. Essentially an individualist, whilst dependent upon friends and kindred spirits, he succeeded in keeping alive his wide interests and, through the attraction of his personality, the contacts which were necessary to him. Science, literature, music, human affairs, all retained their accustomed importance, although in a increasingly restricted sense as the enemy, whom he could not conquer, but who never defeated his active mind, encircled him ever more tightly. Each outpost lost led to new adjustments, every cold or minor ailment added to the rate of downward progress without hope of improvement. But his courage, tenacity and constructiveness remained unimpaired.|$|E
