Good agreement between the modeled and observed orientation angles, wavelengths and Reynolds numbers are found when the streets are assumed to derive their energy from the average shear and the lowest order sine terms of a Fourier expansion of the mean wind profile (or equivalently from the lowest order cosine terms of the mean shear profile). The modes associated with the cosine terms of the wind profile (or the sine terms of the <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> <b>profile)</b> do not agree well with the observations.

Both methods are applied to a linear <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> <b>profile</b> and the Galerkin method is determined to be significantly superior in predicting the lowest order, and is therefore suitable for formulating the latitudinal structure of quasi-stationary Rossby waves in the middle atmosphere.

40|$|A {{characterization}} of mean and turbulent flow behaviour over complex topography was conducted using a large-scale (1 [*]:[*] 25) {{model in the}} WindEEE Dome at Western University. The specific topographic feature considered was the Bolund Hill escarpment facing westerly winds. A total of eight unique inflow conditions were tested in order to isolate the impact of key parameters such as Reynolds number, inflow shear profile, and effective roughness, on flow behaviour over the escarpment. The {{results show that the}} mean flow behaviour was generally not affected by the Reynolds number; however, a slight increase in speed-up over the escarpment was observed for cases with lower inflow roughness. The shape of the inflow <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> <b>profile</b> also had a minor impact on the mean flow near the escarpment. More significant effects were observed in the turbulent flow behaviour, where the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) over the escarpment was found be a strong function of inflow roughness and a weak function of the Reynolds number. The local change in the inflow wind shear was found to have the most significant influence on the TKE magnitude, which more closely approximated the full-scale TKE data, a result which had not been previously observed in wind tunnel modelling of this topography...|$|E

The intrinsic predictability of the atmosphere at the mesoscales (5 – 400 km) is studied using idealized simulations of organized deep convection under several different profiles of environmental vertical <b>wind</b> <b>shear.</b> Initial errors of equal amplitude are introduced in the moisture field either at small scales (8 km) or large scales (128 km).

Two-dimensional numerical simulations using the Advanced Regional Prediction System model are employed. Five sets of simulations are performed, each testing eight <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> <b>profiles</b> of varying strength and depth. The first set of simulations contains a squall line but no surface or radiation physics. The second and third sets do not contain a squall line but include surface and radiation physics with a land surface {{on the right and}} a water surface on the left of the domain. The land is either warmer or cooler than the sea surface. These three simulations provide a control for later simulations. Finally, the remaining two simulation sets examine squall-line interaction with a relatively cool or warm land surface. The simu-lations document the thermodynamic and shear characteristics of squall lines interacting with the coastline. Results show that the inclusion of a land surface did not sufficiently affect the thermodynamic properties ahead of the squall line to change its overall structure. Investigation of ambient shear ahead of the squall line revealed that the addition of either warm or cool land reduced the strength of the net circulation in the inflow layer as measured by ambient shear. The amount of reduction in shear was found to be directly proportional to the depth and strength of the original shear layer. For stronger and deeper shears, th...|$|R

This study quantifies the vertical transport of tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) by deep mesoscale convective systems and assesses {{the ability of the}} satellite-borne Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) to detect the resulting enhanced CO in the upper atmosphere. A squall line that is similar to one occurring during NASA's INTEX-B mission is simulated using a typical environmental <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> <b>profile</b> and the 2 -D Goddard Cumulus Ensemble model. The simulation provides post-convection CO profiles. The structure of the simulated squall line is examined, and its vertical transport of CO is quantified.

Results show that the simulated squall line transports the greatest mass of CO in the upper levels, with a value of 96 t upward and 67 t downward at 300 hPa. Results indicate that TES has sufficient sensitivity to resolve convectively lofted CO, as long as the retrieval scene is cloud-free. TES swaths located immediately downwind of squall lines have the greatest chance of sensing convective transport because the impact of clouds on retrieval quality becomes less.

40|$|Recently, three {{distinct}} archetypes for midlatitude linear mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) have been identified. This {{article focuses on}} the fundamentals of two of these archetypes: con-vective lines with trailing stratiform (TS) precipitation and convective lines with leading stratiform (LS) precipitation. Both the TS and LS modes typically exhibit quasi– 2 D reflectivity patterns and quasi– 2 D environmental storm–relative wind fields. Ongoing work has revealed {{that there are three}} common flow structures for these quasi– 2 D MCSs: front–fed TS systems (which are sustained by front–to–rear storm-relative inflow), as well as front–fed LS and rear–fed LS systems (which are sustained by rear–to–front storm-relative inflow). This paper summarizes the observed structures of the front–fed TS, front–fed LS, and rear–fed LS modes and then outlines an idealized numerical experiment in which these modes were simulated. The authors analyze the basic simulated kine-matic and microphysical structures and provide a framework in which to analyze the dynamics of the modeled systems. To a large degree, the organizational modes of developing quasi– 2 D MCSs may be anticipated by considering the magnitudes and preferred directions of the horizontal pres-sure gradient accelerations associated with a surface cold pool (whose strength is largely related to the environmental humidity and CAPE) and an updraft in the mean environmental <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> <b>profile.</b> In this regard, the lower tropospheric shear is of prime importance, although the middle and upper tropospheric shear provide for additional, non–trivial accelerations. 1 1...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The evolution and structure of simulated Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS) were examined using the Collaborative Model for Multiscale Atmospheric Simulations. Three numerical simulations were performed, with the amount of vertical wind shear in the lowest 2. 5 km varying from 10 - 25 m s??. A fourth simulation was conducted using the weak <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> <b>profile</b> and incorporating ice microphysics. An analysis domain was produced every two hours for the northern and southern portions of the convective line in order to analyze the temporal and spatial variability of each system. Horizontal cross-sections across each MCS revealed that increasing amounts of shear produced larger, stronger and more symmetric convective systems. The structure of the weak shear simulation was very similar to conceptual models of asymmetric squall lines. More intense convection was located along the center and southwest flanks of the line. In contrast, the northern section of the line was characterized by more isolated cells that weakened over time. A broad, cyclonic mesovortex was found in the mid-levels of the stratiform region behind the northern portion of the convective line. As the vertical wind shear increased, there was no preferred location for the most intense convection {{and the size of the}} mid-level cyclonic circulation decreased. However, a strong rear-inflow jet was produced in the moderate and strong shear cases. This jet remained elevated to the back of the convective line and may have aided in the maintenance of the strength of the convection. Profiles of area-averaged vertical velocity in the convective region showed that as shear increased the temporal variability in the vertical motion decreased. The strength and number of strong updrafts declined after a maximum vertical velocity was achieved. Also, the maximum vertical velocity occurred later in the simulation as the amount of vertical wind shear increased. As the area-averaged vertical velocity decreased, the height at which the peak velocity occurs decreased as well. Vertical profiles of heating followed a similar temporal pattern as the profiles of vertical velocity. Little spatial variability in the heat budgets was observed. The height at which the peak heating occurred was considerably lower than the peak of vertical velocity. Also, a secondary peak of heating was observed at upper-levels...|$|E
40|$|As {{the demand}} for global {{renewable}} energy grows, so does {{the demand for}} more efficient energy conversion machines and better wind resource assessment. The need to convert {{as much energy as}} possible with little cost remains the biggest challenge. In the wind energy sector, the quantity of the resource “wind” is not hard to locate, as with current ground and space based remote sensing technologies, and climate reanalysis techniques, the mapping of average wind speeds across the globe is achievable. The difficulty lies in identifying the “quality” of the wind resource. “Quality” is the measure of the time variant properties of the wind, and time scale here does not represent seasonal, monthly, or the daily variability, but rather the changes within hours, minutes, seconds, and sub‐second periods. Wind possesses a highly unpredictable, and non‐universal character, which is referred to as turbulence. These intermittencies in the wind speed create variable mechanical loads on the structure of wind turbines leading to fatigue, and ultimately failure. Identifying site specific qualities of the wind resource is very crucial in the design and selection process of the wind turbine. Physical theories explaining wind turbulence phenomena over flat terrain have been critiqued and tested by observations, and in general, have achieved reasonable success in explaining surface layer wind dynamics that can be applied universally. This universality, and the extrapolation of flat terrain theories to complex terrain applications, breaks down most of the time due to the newly recognized spatial and temporal spectrum of interaction modes, mechanically and thermodynamically, with the surrounding complex terrain. In terrain as found in New Zealand, most of the wind farm development is carried out over complex terrain, with ridge top and mountainous installations. In this study, an experimental campaign was carried out over a coastal ridge top, proposed for wind farming, to investigate mean and turbulent wind flow features significant for wind turbine selection and placement across the ridge. The steep sloped faces of the ridge, high wind speeds and its proximity to the sea made this location ideal for a benchmark investigation site. Ultra‐sonic ii anemometers, a sodar (sound detection and ranging) wind profiler, and high resolution LES (large eddy simulation) numerical modelling were all utilized separately and in an interconnected way to provide a comprehensive analysis of the wind dynamics over the ridge top. The three principal components of the investigation were: the effect of the upstream topography and the thermal circulation associated with the proximity to the sea on the observed and modelled wind shear vertical profile; the role that the near upwind terrain plays in shaping the turbulence energy spectrum and influencing the predicted spectrum, ultimately affecting isotropy in the flow field and turbulence length scales; turbulence advection from far topography, and the role that far upwind terrain plays in altering the wind turbulence in a measurement area or at a single point. Results showed that the thermal wind circulations and upstream steep topography could dictate the <b>wind</b> <b>shear</b> <b>profile,</b> and consequently have a large impact on wind turbine height selection and placement. The sodar proved to be a very useful tool in identifying vertical shear zones associated with effects of steep upstream terrain, vertical mixing of horizontal momentum, and thermal circulation from the local sea breeze. In complex terrain, the added multi‐directional perturbations from the underlying roughness redistribute the statistical variations (measured by variances) in the three spatial dimensions. Isotropy, based on measured variances, was attained for both sites on the ridge. Isotropy also held true for the energy spectrum via Fourier analysis of the high temporal resolution data, but not for both sites. In general, local isotropy can be attained in cases of higher wind speeds and increased terrain relief. Measured spectral ratios did not converge to the limit suggested by the local isotropy hypothesis. These results identify contradictions in assessing the turbulence isotropy in both real space (statistically through variances) and Fourier space (through power spectrum analysis), which suggests caution in deriving or interpreting turbulence information for wind turbine design and selection. iii 2 D‐LES experiments showed that turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) can attain long range memory of underlying terrain, which can then react accordingly with upcoming terrain. Under the high wind speed scenarios, which are suitable for wind farming, and over relatively complex terrain, the flow retained some aspects of terrain information at least 30 H (H is the terrain height) upstream and downstream of the terrain. In general, as the turbulence field travels over new terrain it tends to increase in intensity downstream of that feature. The newly modified TKE field acquires geometric features from the underlying terrain; mainly these features register as amplifications in the wave structure of the field at wavelengths comparable to the height of the underlying terrain. The 2 D‐LES sensitivity experiments identified key areas of high mean wind speed and turbulence in relation to terrain effects, all of which should be taken into consideration when thinking of locating a wind farm in such areas...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{research}} on rough-to-smooth transition of an equilibrium neutral constant stress layer {{is to develop a}} model for low-level atmospheric flow over terrains of abruptly changing roughness, such as those occurring near the windward end of a landing strip, and to use the model to derive functions which define the extent of the region affected by the roughness change and allow adequate prediction of <b>wind</b> and <b>shear</b> stress <b>profiles</b> at all points within the region. A model consisting of two bounding logarithmic layers and an intermediate velocity defect layer is assumed, and dimensionless velocity and stress distribution functions which meet all boundary and matching conditions are hypothesized. The functions are used in an asymptotic form of the equation of motion to derive a relation which governs the growth of the internal boundary layer. The growth relation is used to predict variation of surface shear stress...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} a new {{approach}} to the evaluation of surface gravity wave drag (GWD) is assessed. This approach uses linear theory, but incorporates the effects of <b>wind</b> <b>profile</b> <b>shear</b> and curvature, by means of a second-order WKB approximation. While the theory predicts the possibility of either drag enhancement or reduction, depending on the wind profile, results obtained with the ERA- 40 reanalysis data clearly indicate the predominance of local drag enhancement. However, the global impact of shear on the atmospheric axial GWD torque comes mostly from regions with predominantly easterly flow, contributing to a slight reduction of the bias found in different studies of the global angular momentum budget. The relative correction due to shear on linear GWD is found not to depend too strongly on the levels chosen for the computation of the low-level wind derivatives...|$|R
