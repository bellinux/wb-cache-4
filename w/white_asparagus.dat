Ramsay said in interviews around the launch of the restaurant that he aimed to keep [...] "it all very lean, lean, lean. No heavy sauces". He compared the menu to a cross between The Ivy, his own Boxwood Cafe and The Wolseley. A specific menu is offered for quick dining, called [...] "Plane Fast".

30|$|We {{emphasize}} {{that it is}} not the use of calorie value and nutrition value is inappropriate or unsophisticated; it is that the adoption of calorie and nutrition measures may differentiate food commodities unnecessarily, and adds levels of complexity to the entire estimating process. For example, equivalent weight measures of fresh asparagus, frozen asparagus, cooked asparagus, and canned asparagus will have varying levels of calorie and nutrition. It is possible to make the same argument for the different varieties of <b>asparagus</b> (<b>white,</b> green, purple, and wild). Furthermore, other researchers have argued that where and how the produce is grown (in fertile versus arid lands; using various cultivation practices), processed, transported, stored, and prepared will influence calorie and nutrition values.|$|R

50|$|Now it's {{time for}} this week's challenge, with special guest Chef Rocco DiSpirito, who is here to help them learn to cook healthy. Each team will prepare a meal for Rocco, and {{the team with the}} best dish gets a one-pound {{advantage}} at the weigh-in. Rocco will be looking for taste, creativity and naturally, healthfulness. The Blue Team decides to make an egg white frittata and a healthy spin on French toast. The White Team makes an egg <b>white</b> omelet with <b>asparagus</b> and salmon, topped with homemade salsa and avocado, as well as French toast. The Red Team creates a turkey burger with egg on top, sweet potato chips and fruit. Rocco and Ali taste all the dishes, and Rocco is very impressed. In terms of flavor, the Red Team stood out, but not in a good way. Their turkey burger had way too much jalapeño and was basically inedible. It was neck and neck between Blue and White, and solely based on the nutritional value, the winner of a one-pound advantage is... the White Team! The other teams are concerned with the White Team's win; since they are the lightest team at the ranch, one pound can go a long way.|$|R
