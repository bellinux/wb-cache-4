5|$|In 1869, Grant was {{urged by}} popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with {{military}} assistance {{and to give}} them U.S. diplomatic recognition. Grant and Fish instead attempted to use arbitration with Spain with minister Daniel Sickles negotiating. Grant and Fish wanted Cuban independence and to end slavery <b>without</b> <b>U.S.</b> military intervention or occupation. Fish, diligently and against popular pressure, {{was able to keep}} Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the Alabama Claims. The Sickle's peace negotiations failed in Madrid, but Grant and Fish did not succumb to popular pressure for U.S. military involvement in the Cuban rebellion. Grant and Fish sent a message to Congress, written by Fish and signed by Grant. The message urged strict neutrality not to officially recognize the Cuban revolt, calming national fears.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 Draft {{marked the}} first time three players drafted in the top 10 came from the same school: the University of Florida. Florida, the 2007 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Basketball champion, tied the record set by the University of Connecticut in 2006 with five players {{selected}} in the first two rounds of an NBA draft. Florida joined nine other schools, including Connecticut, that had five players selected in an NBA draft, second only to UNLV, which had six players selected in the eighth-round 1977 draft. Five players who competed in the 2007 NCAA Basketball National Championship Final were selected in the top 10; three players came from Florida, and two players came from the runner-up, Ohio State University. This draft also set the record number of freshmen drafted in the first round when eight freshmen were selected. Of the 60 players drafted, eight were freshmen, five were sophomores, 14 were juniors, 20 were seniors, and 13 were international players <b>without</b> <b>U.S.</b> college basketball experience. The Cleveland Cavaliers, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers and Toronto Raptors all did not have a draft pick this year, although Indiana and Toronto each acquired a drafted player's rights after the draft.|$|E
5|$|The World <b>Without</b> <b>Us</b> applies a more {{ecological}} view to Earth Abides.

He {{has worked as}} an international journalist for American magazines and newspapers, {{and at the time}} of writing the book was an Associate Professor of Journalism and Latin American Studies at the University of Arizona.

5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (<b>without</b> <b>us).</b> The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E
25|$|Barker et al. (2007, p.79) {{assessed}} {{the literature on}} cost estimates for the Kyoto Protocol. Due to non-US participation in the Kyoto treaty, costs estimates {{were found to be}} much lower than those estimated in the previous IPCC Third Assessment Report. <b>Without</b> <b>US</b> participation, and with full use of the Kyoto flexible mechanisms, costs were estimated at less than 0.05% of Annex B GDP. This compared to earlier estimates of 0.1–1.1%. Without use of the flexible mechanisms, costs <b>without</b> <b>US</b> participation were estimated at less than 0.1%. This compared to earlier estimates of 0.2–2%. These cost estimates were viewed as being based on much evidence and high agreement in the literature.|$|E

The war ended as it began, <b>without</b> <b>U.S.</b> nuclear weapons deployed near battle.|$|E

25|$|As a prospect, Bargnani drew many {{comparisons}} to German NBA player Dirk Nowitzki, mainly {{due to his}} ability to shoot from the perimeter, his mobility despite his size, and his ball-handling skills. Bargnani entered the 2006 NBA draft and was selected first overall by the Toronto Raptors.

Although this had the support of the Bush administration it was repeatedly blocked by U.S. Representative Henry Hyde, on the grounds that British laws were insufficient to prevent unauthorised transfer of U.S. technology to third parties.|$|E

25|$|On 5 November 2012, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his {{willingness}} to mount a unilateral attack on Iran's nuclear facilities even <b>without</b> <b>US</b> support. This conflicts with experts' assessments that US support is needed {{in the form of}} the newer GBU-31 bunker busting bombs, which are required to penetrate some of Iran's reinforced nuclear facilities such as the Fordo site. Israel currently only has the GBU-28 bunker busting munitions, which are said to be insufficient. However, with the announcement by Netanyahu being made on the eve of the 2012 Presidential elections, tensions between the two allies are likely to rise.|$|E
25|$|To further her cause, Huerta {{created the}} Agricultural Workers Association (AWA) in 1960. Through the AWA, she lobbied {{politicians}} on many issues, including allowing migrant workers <b>without</b> <b>U.S.</b> citizenship to receive public assistance and pensions and creating Spanish-language voting ballots and driver's tests. In 1962, she co-founded a workers' union with César Chávez, which was later {{known as the}} United Farm Workers (UFW). The two made a great team. Chávez was the dynamic leader and speaker and Huerta was a skilled organizer and tough negotiator. Huerta {{was instrumental in the}} union's many successes, including the strikes against California grape growers in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
25|$|The Río Piedras {{massacre}} of four Puerto Rican Nationalist Party members occurred on October 24, 1935. The Nationalist Party blamed these deaths on Elisha Francis Riggs, a former United States Army Colonel whom, at the time, {{was the top}} U.S.-appointed police officer on the entire island. Consequently on February 23, 1936, Colonel Riggs was assassinated by Nationalists Hiram Rosado and Elías Beauchamp. This prompted U.S Senator Millard Tydings to introduce a legislation to grant independence to Puerto Rico. Dávila Monsanto {{was in favor of}} the proposal. However Luis Muñoz Marín objected because, in his view, Puerto Rico was incapable of independence <b>without</b> <b>U.S.</b> economic support.|$|E

25|$|Thiệu took a {{cautious}} approach, as did Có and Cang, {{and they were}} pre-empted by Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo, an undetected communist double agent, who launched a coup with Phát on a hardline Catholic platform <b>without</b> <b>U.S.</b> backing. With U.S. support against both Khánh and the plotters, Kỳ and Thi put down the coup attempt and then ousted Khánh. This left Kỳ, Thi and Thiệu as the three most prominent members in the new junta. There were claims that Thiệu ordered the military to capture and extrajudicially kill Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo, who died in 1965 {{after a series of}} coup attempts between various ARVN officers. Other sources blame Kỳ. During this period, Thiệu became more prominent as other generals fought and defeated one another in coups, which forced several into exile.|$|E
25|$|The Tet Offensive {{saw some}} steady ARVN {{performances}} and military {{defeat of the}} VC during Tet allowed the ARVN to consolidate its gains. The GVN made measurable progress in securing its population base—retaking areas once dominated by the VC and rooting out their clandestine infrastructure. While old problems like corruption, leadership and political interference continued to dog them, some historians argue that with continued US material aid, the improved South Vietnamese forces, might have contained and overcome a moderate guerrilla-level war. By 1972, the guerrilla threat had essentially been reduced to low-level proportions and the Southern regime's hand was strengthened. The war however had ceased being primarily a guerrilla conflict and had become conventional, with Hanoi openly bidding for victory during the 1972 Easter attack. ARVN troops simply could not cope {{in the long term}} <b>without</b> <b>US</b> assistance and firepower against a ruthless, well organized, and well supplied conventional Northern foe.|$|E
