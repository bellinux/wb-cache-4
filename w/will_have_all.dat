25|$|For instance, in the ABA {{transfer}} system {{a group of}} say eight racers {{sign up for the}} 17-18 Intermediate class. That is more than enough to have three motos (four is the minimum). Moto #1 <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> eight racers. The first two finishers qualify for and do not race again until the Main. Moto #2 will be a second heat for the remaining six racers; again, the first two across the finish line from that group will go the Main. Finally, a third moto of the remaining four riders is run, from which the first two racers across the finish line will be taken to the Main, forming a six-man Main. The last two racers do not qualify (DNQ) and therefore do not race in the Main, do not collect any points, trophies, a chance to take a step in advancement to a higher amateur level or if they are professionals, prize money.|$|E
500|$|HDMI {{devices are}} {{manufactured}} {{to adhere to}} various versions of the specification, in which each version is given a number or letter, such as 1.0, 1.2, or 1.4b. Each subsequent version of the specification uses {{the same kind of}} cable but increases the bandwidth or capabilities of what can be transmitted over the cable. A product listed as having an HDMI version {{does not necessarily mean that}} it <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> of the features that are listed for that version, since some HDMI features are optional, such as deep color and xvYCC (which is branded by Sony as [...] "x.v.Color"). [...] Note that with the release of the version 1.4 cable, the HDMI Licensing LLC group (which oversees the HDMI standard) will require that any reference to version numbers be removed from all packaging and advertising for the cable. Non-cable HDMI products starting on January 1, 2012 will no longer be allowed to reference the HDMI number and will be required to state which features of the HDMI specification the product implements.|$|E

2500|$|In 1675, the Iroquois {{made peace}} with the Machian while finally {{defeating}} the Susquenhannock. In the late 1670s and early 1680s, the Five Nations started to raid {{what is now the}} Midwest, battling the Miami and the Illinois while alternatively fighting against and attempting to make an alliance with the Ottawa. One Onondaga chief, Otreouti, whom the French called La Grande Gueule ("the big mouth"), announced in a speech in 1684 that the wars against the Illinois and Miami were justified because [...] "They came to hunt beavers on our lands...". Initially, the French took an ambivalent attitude towards the Iroquois push west. On one hand, having the Five Nations at war with other nations prevented those nations from trading with the English at Albany while on the other hand, the French did not want to the Iroquois become the only middlemen in the fur trade. But as the Iroquois continued to win against the other nations, prevented French and Algonquin fur traders from entering the Mississippi river valley, and the Ottawa showed signs of finally making an alliance with the Five Nations, in 1684 the French declared war on the Iroquois. Otreouti in an appeal for help correctly noted: [...] "The French <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> the beavers and are angry with us for bringing you any". Starting in 1684, the French repeatedly raided Kanienkeh, burning crops and villages as Louis gave orders to [...] "humble" [...] the Five Nations once and for all, and to teach them to respect the [...] "grandeur" [...] of France. The repeated French raids took their toll with the Mohawk who could field about 300 warriors in the 1670s to able to field only 170 warriors in the summer of 1691. The Iroquois struck back by making raids into New France with the most successful being a raid on Lachine in 1689 that killed 24 Frenchmen while taking 80 captives, but the superior resources of the French state proceeded to grind them down until they finally made peace in 1701.|$|E
