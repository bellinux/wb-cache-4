60|$|Rosy. Doubtless you may--I'll {{answer for}} the lieutenant's {{behaviour}} whilst honest Humphrey is <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you propose}} to communicate, sir, either <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> or with Miss Batchford, while Lucilla is {{away from the}} rectory? My object in venturing to ask----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The secret {{between you}} and Sir Percival is not THAT secret," [...] I persisted. [...] "The mystery which darkens Sir Percival's life was not born <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter's</b> birth, and has not died <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter's</b> death." ...|$|R
60|$|CHARTERIS (desperately). Craven: you're trifling <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter's</b> happiness. I only ask {{five minutes}} more.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am not so}} sure, your lordship," [...] Dory answered. [...] "The Clenarvon {{diamonds}} {{are known}} all over the world, and I suppose there isn't a thieves' den in Europe that does not know that they will remain here exposed <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter's</b> other wedding presents." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I," [...] Wrayson declared, {{with barely}} {{suppressed}} excitement, [...] "am {{beginning to see}} at least the shadow of daylight. If only you had some influence <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter,</b> Colonel!" ...|$|E
6000|$|SIR WILLIAM. I didn't {{suppose you}} were, Studdenham. It appears to rest <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter.</b> [He {{suddenly}} {{takes out his}} handkerchief, and puts it to his forehead] Infernal fires they make up here! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very large;--so {{large as}} to affect my daily mode of life. In my {{correspondence}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter,</b> I considered {{it to be}} my duty {{to point out to}} her that it would be so. I do not know whether she told you.' ...|$|E
60|$|Lop. There's one Don Melchor de Guzman, {{a friend}} and {{acquaintance}} of mine, that is desperately in love <b>with</b> <b>your</b> eldest <b>daughter</b> Donna Theodosia.|$|R
6000|$|... "May I hope, madam, for <b>your</b> {{interest}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> fair <b>daughter</b> Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of {{a private}} audience {{with her in the}} course of this morning?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Not to {{have sexual}} {{relations}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> fathers wifes <b>daughter</b> [...] - ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now I'm {{going to}} tell you that I have fallen in love <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> Madeline." [...] As the judge wished to have the tale told quickly, I think he had reason to be {{satisfied}} with the very succinct terms used by Felix Graham.|$|E
6000|$|... "...you {{put me in}} a very awkward position. I {{was desperately}} in love <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter,</b> and as long as you were in the frame of mind in which you left I could not hope to find an {{opportunity}} of revealing my feelings to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, Mrs. Renshaw, I {{advise you}} {{at once to}} go below <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> and the Miss Mitfords. I do not {{say that we are}} going to have trouble, but if we are this is the time. Pray oblige me by doing as I ask." ...|$|E
60|$|LILY--I am clairvoyant in this case. Allah {{is great}} {{and it will}} be a son--if only to make you and Emily burst <b>with</b> envy among <b>your</b> <b>daughters.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes! That's all gentlemen think of; but I {{meant in}} other ways. She seems {{full of the}} {{rebuilding}} of St. Nicholas, and to be making great friends <b>with</b> <b>your</b> new <b>daughter.</b> You don't think," [...] lowering her voice, [...] "that Raymond would have any objection to meeting her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My Lord Pyncheon may drink what wine he will, and {{wherever}} he pleases," [...] replied the carpenter, {{as if he}} had been privy to Mr. Pyncheon's ambitious projects. [...] "But first, sir, if you desire tidings of this lost document, I must crave the favor of a little talk <b>with</b> <b>your</b> fair <b>daughter</b> Alice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One other thing, sir," [...] I said hurriedly, for he {{was turning}} away, [...] "I {{hope that you will}} not be angry <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> for {{anything}} which I have told you. It was for my sake that she kept it all secret from you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One moment, Mr. Caresfoot; {{first let}} me tell you his offer, then we can talk it over. He offers, conditionally on his {{marriage}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter,</b> to sell you the Isleworth estates at a fair valuation hereafter to be agreed upon, and to make a large settlement." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must also}} beg you to suspend your {{judgment}} {{until you have}} heard me to the end. You may be disposed to view--to view, I say, unfavourably at first--in short, Mr. Sherwin, without further preface, the object of my visit is connected <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter,</b> with Miss Margaret Sherwin--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I!" [...] cried Mrs. Willoughby--"what concern can I have <b>with</b> <b>your</b> news. My <b>daughters</b> {{are both}} with me, and Heaven be praised! both are well. What can I {{care for your}} news, Nick?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mask. Now, sir, I {{have it for}} you. [Aside to his master.]--He was endeavouring, indeed, to {{have got}} away <b>with</b> them; for <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> Theodosia was his prize. But we {{prevented}} him, and left him in the condition in which you see him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} would, Mrs. Conyers. There is {{no formal}} war between England and Ireland, and trading vessels still ply between Cork and Bristol. I {{agree with you}} {{that it would not be}} safe for two Protestant ladies to travel, without protection, from here to Galway, and I shall be only too glad for you to journey <b>with</b> us. <b>Your</b> <b>daughter,</b> I know, can ride any of the country ponies; and for yourself--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, sir," [...] he said; [...] "I am in love <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter.</b> She's one and twenty, and I {{want to see}} her--and in fact----" [...] He {{found it}} hard to express himself. He could think only of a phrase that sounded ridiculous. [...] "I want--in fact--to pay my {{addresses}} to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... --Pray, good shepherd, what [...] Fair swain is {{this that}} dances <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter?</b> [...] * [...] * [...] * [...] * [...] * [...] He sings several {{times faster than}} you'll tell money; [...] he utters them as he had eaten ballads, and all men's [...] ears grow to his tunes. [...] --WINTER'S TALE ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{giving it}} {{a good deal of}} thought, and may be I will some day take up the experimentation--but not <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> as a subject. However, we'll discuss that later. You are tired and I'll show you your room and bath, and after you freshen up a bit we'll discuss our next movement." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Ford gazed hopelessly at {{the hideous}} ranch in the distance, at the sky, and the trail before him; then his glance fell upon the hand still upon his shoulder, and he {{struggled}} with a final effort. [...] "At another time I'd {{like to have a}} long talk <b>with</b> you about <b>your</b> <b>daughter,</b> Mr. McKinstry." ...|$|R
6000|$|I'm {{obliged to}} you, madam: [...] Off a gold dish or plate, [...] If a king, and I had 'em, [...] I could dine in great state. [...] <b>With</b> <b>your</b> own father's <b>daughter</b> [...] I'd {{be sure to}} agree, [...] But to drink the salt water [...] Wouldn't do so with me! ...|$|R
5000|$|Umar {{noted that}} the women of Medina [...] "had the upper hand over their men," [...] and that the Meccan women who emigrated to Medina started imitating their behaviour. An altercation {{occurred}} when Umar {{had to make a}} decision, and his wife advised him. Umar shouted at her to mind her own business. The wife answered back, and he expressed displeasure. The wife responded: [...] "How strange you are! You don't want to be argued <b>with,</b> whereas <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> Hafsa argues <b>with</b> Allah's Messenger so much that he remains angry for a full day!" [...] It is assumed that this unnamed wife was Zaynab because of her apparent intimacy with Hafsa.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, sir, this is {{all very}} well," [...] he began, [...] "but why can't I fall in love <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter?</b> I'm a Doctor of Science and {{all that sort of}} thing. I've a {{perfectly}} decent outlook. My father was rather a swell in his science. I'm an entirely decent and respectable person." ...|$|E
6000|$|KNOX. [angrily] And {{is a man}} {{never to}} {{have a bit of}} fun? See whats come of it <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter!</b> She was to be content with your {{happiness}} that youre always talking about; and how did the spirit guide her? To a month's hard for being drunk and assaulting the police. Did I ever assault the police? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it lunch, Mrs O'Kelly, pray don't {{think of}} troubling {{yourself}} {{to have lunch}} on the table. Maybe we'll be a deal nearer Creamstown than Kelly's Court at lunch time. But it's quite time we were off. As for Bingham Blake, {{from the look of}} him, he's going to stay here <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>daughter</b> Augusta all the morning." ...|$|E
5000|$|Two of Tutton's books {{center on}} taboo relationships. Mamma (1955) is about Joanna Malling, a middle-aged widow who {{falls in love}} with her new son-in-law, a man who is much nearer to her own age than to her daughter's. Despite {{attraction}} on both sides, the relationship is never consummated, and Tutton ends her book by having the daughter and son-in-law—who had both been living with Joanna—move away. Even more than <b>with</b> Guard <b>Your</b> <b>Daughters,</b> Tutton takes a story with tragic overtones and treats it on the surface as a social comedy. It was serialized in an abridged version on the BBC program [...] "Woman's Hour" [...] in 1956, read in ten installments by Jill Balcon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, {{but that}} lucky minute, father? I {{question}} much if Catharine ever {{has such a}} moment to glance on earth and its inhabitants as might lead her {{to listen to a}} coarse ignorant borrel man like me. I cannot tell how it is, father; elsewhere I can hold up my head like another man, but <b>with</b> <b>your</b> saintly <b>daughter</b> I lose heart and courage, and I cannot help thinking that it would be well nigh robbing a holy shrine if I could succeed in surprising her affections. Her thoughts are too much fitted for Heaven to be wasted on such a one as I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My God, sir!' Van Tromp broke out, 'I {{have had}} about enough of this. Your son? God {{knows where he}} is for me! What the devil have I to do <b>with</b> <b>your</b> son? My <b>daughter</b> is out, for the matter of that; I might ask you where she was, {{and what would you}} say to that? But this is all midsummer madness. Name your {{business}} distinctly, and be off.' ...|$|R
