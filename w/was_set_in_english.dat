40|$|Research on Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) {{is slowly}} coming of age, {{as can be}} seen in the growing number of studies from {{different}} educational contexts. While the majority of research in the field focuses on general assumptions on CLIL, this study argues the case for more subject specific CLIL research that takes subject specific methodologies into account. Concentrating on the subject area of physical education (PE), the research project features the in-depth study of four cases which all combine language learning and sport. All cases <b>are</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>English</b> secondary state schools but the design of the projects necessarily varies regarding organisation, length, age group and agenda. Using case study methodology, each case is looked at individually before three common features are identified, which are then discussed in the wider context. First of all, none of the projects uses the term CLIL as a label, suggesting that the term is not commonly used or known. Secondly, all projects are initiated by language teachers and instrumentalise sport for language learning, with no PE staff being involved in the delivery of the projects, and this has consequences for the quality of PE specific learning. Thirdly, the cases show how CLIL in PE can offer kinaesthetic learning experiences, which are often neglected in a school context. Through linking language learning and sport within a CLIL PE setting, the learning experience is perceived as new and different by students. This, in combination with providing an immediate purpose for language learning, is regarded as a factor that has the potential to raise learners’ motivation...|$|R
