5|$|Before Game of Thrones both Benioff and Weiss {{worked in}} film, and were {{unfamiliar}} <b>with</b> <b>working</b> {{on a television}} show. This resulted in several first-season episodes being about 10 minutes too short for HBO, forcing them to write another 100 pages of scripts in two weeks. Due to lack of budget the new scenes were designed to be inexpensive to film, such as two actors conversing in one room. Benioff and Weiss noted {{that some of their}} favorite scenes from the first season were the results of the dilemma, including one between Robert and Cersei Baratheon discussing their marriage.|$|E

40|$|Background: Sick leave {{within the}} police has {{increased}} {{in recent years and}} the highest increase has been seen among female police officers over 50 years. Objective: The aim of the present study is to identify the presence of physical symptoms, emotional exhaustion and depersonalization of female police officers <b>working</b> <b>with</b> patrolling and police officers <b>working</b> <b>with</b> investigation in the North region of Sweden. Method: The study was conducted with web-based questionnaire, answered by female police officers: police officers <b>working</b> <b>with</b> patrolling (n= 40) and police officers <b>working</b> <b>with</b> investigation (n= 44) in the North region of Sweden. The survey consisted of a total of 37 questions. To measure burnout Maslach Burnout Inventory was used. Results: A significant difference was seen {{in the presence of the}} physical symptom headache between female police officers <b>working</b> <b>with</b> patrolling and female police officers <b>working</b> <b>with</b> investigation. The group <b>working</b> <b>with</b> investigation reported higher incidence of headaches than the group <b>working</b> <b>with</b> intervention.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to its earlier place amongst the wealthy, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the pasty became popular <b>with</b> <b>working</b> people in Cornwall, where tin miners and others adopted it {{due to its}} unique shape, forming a complete meal that could be carried easily and eaten without cutlery. In a mine, the pasty's dense, folded pastry could stay warm for several hours, and if it did get cold, it could easily be warmed on a shovel over a candle.|$|E

The three attendants also gave examples of firsthand experience with turnpike customers that had convinced them that motorists were not as supportive of turnpikes as OTA executives believed. OTA responded to their employees' remarks by highlighting an Occupational Safety and Health Administration study that found that the toll gate that the three attendants worked at met all safety standards.|$|E

5|$|Shay {{was born}} in Springfield, Ohio, on November 8, 1876, to Irish immigrants. Around the time of Shay's birth, Springfield was a town {{characterized}} by tense race relations.

Black residents soon outnumbered whites, and they competed for jobs <b>with</b> <b>working</b> class white citizens like Shay's parents. Schools were integrated in Springfield when Shay was nine years old. He left Springfield by 1895 to begin his career in minor league baseball.|$|E
5|$|The Woolwich Rotunda Artillery Museum and the States of Jersey lent {{examples}} of Warriors original primary guns, the muzzle-loading 68-pounder and the breech-loading 110-pounder, which {{were used as}} moulds for fibreglass replicas. The Armstrong guns were built <b>with</b> <b>working</b> breeches; they, and the muzzles of all the guns, had to be sealed to prevent people leaving rubbish in them. Little information was available on the wooden gun carriages despite extensive research, and a prototype had to be developed and tested before they could be built.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in working memory. The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low working memory capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low working memory looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high working memory capacity. It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- working memory capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated <b>with</b> <b>working</b> memory capacity in other studies.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium {{was used}} by the Manhattan Project as a neutron reflector, and as a {{component}} of modulated neutron initiators. Only one firm produced it commercially in the United States, Brush Beryllium in Lorain, Ohio. The Ames Project began working on a production process in December 1943, reducing beryllium fluoride in a bomb with metallic magnesium and a sulphur booster. The main difficulty <b>with</b> <b>working</b> with beryllium was its high toxicity. A closed bomb was used to minimize the possibility of producing toxic beryllium dust. The process worked, but the high temperatures and pressures created by the magnesium sulphide meant that it was potentially explosive. An alternative was then developed using beryllium fluoride in a bomb with metallic calcium and a lead chloride booster. The metal was cast in a vacuum. Research was still ongoing when the war ended.|$|E
5|$|Friedland {{was laid}} down at Lorient in January 1865 and {{launched}} on 15 October 1873. While the exact reason for such prolonged construction {{time is not}} known, the budget for the French Navy was cut after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 and the French dockyards had not been reformed <b>with</b> <b>working</b> practices more suitable for the industrial age. The ship began her sea trials on 1 May 1875, but was not completed until 20 June 1877. Friedland joined the Mediterranean Squadron in 1878 and the ship bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax from 6–16 July 1881 {{as part of the}} French occupation of Tunisia. She was reduced to reserve in 1887 and decommissioned in 1893. Friedland returned to active duty in 1893, but was paid off in 1898 and condemned in 1902.|$|E

In addition to residing in Beaumont, he owned estates in Houston and San Antonio. He remained a bachelor until the age of 45. In 1905, he adopted a young woman named Annie Jahn, who at the time was fifteen. Three years later Higgins married her, and later had three children with her, despite the scandal. Higgins died in San Antonio on June 5, 1955.|$|E
