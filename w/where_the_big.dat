5|$|Following Murray's strong end to 2014 and {{reaching}} {{the final of}} the 2015 Australian Open, he moved into the top four in the ATP rankings {{for the first time in}} over year, meaning that the Big Four held the top four places in the rankings for the first time since early 2013, slowing the idea of the regression of the quartet. However, Federer and Nadal both lost in the third round and in the quarterfinals respectively, the first time in 12 appearances that Federer had lost before the semi-finals at the first Grand Slam of the season. Djokovic won the title, as well as the first three Masters titles of the year in Indian Wells (<b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Four were the top four seeds in ATP Masters 1000 event for the time since 2012), Miami and Monte-Carlo, defeating Murray in the final in Miami (his seventh straight victory against the Brit) and Federer in the final of Indian Wells respectively.

2500|$|The hamburger's {{international}} popularity {{demonstrates the}} larger globalization {{of food that}} also includes the rise in global popularity of other national dishes, including the Italian pizza, and Japanese sushi.

2500|$|After {{the fall}} of Shashanka's kingdom, the Bengal region {{was in a state}} of anarchy. There was no central authority, and there was {{constant}} struggle between petty chieftains. The contemporary writings describe this situation as matsya nyaya ("fish justice" [...] i.e. a situation <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> fish eat the small fish). Gopala ascended the throne as the first Pala king during these times. The Khalimpur copper plate suggests that the prakriti (people) of the region made him the king. Taranatha, writing nearly 800 years later, also writes that he was democratically elected by the people of Bengal. However, his account is in form of a legend, and is considered historically unreliable. The legend mentions that after a period of anarchy, the people elected several kings in succession, all of whom were consumed by the Naga queen of an earlier king on the night following their election. Gopal, however managed to kill the queen and remained on the throne. The historical evidence indicates that Gopala was not elected directly by his citizens, but by a group of feudal chieftains. Such elections were quite common in contemporary societies of the region.|$|E
