40|$|In 1995 - 96, {{students}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss</b> constituted 0. 20 % of {{all students}} who were enrolled on programmes of study in {{higher education in the}} UK and 0. 22 % of students normally resident in the UK. Their representation varied with age, but within each ageband the representation of students <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss</b> was markedly lower than the prevalence of hearing loss in the general population. This trend was compounded among students in ethnic minorities. Students <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss</b> tended to have been admitted with lower qualifications than students with no reported disability, but those with passes at GCE Advanced Level had similar points scores. The representation of students <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss</b> varied inversely with their level of study, it was greater in part-time students than in full-time students, and it varied markedly across different disciplines. In first-degree programmes, students <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss</b> were equally represented in the first and subsequent years of study; at other levels, {{they were more likely to}} choose programmes that were of only a year's duration. The representation of students <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss</b> was lower among those who obtained qualifications than among those who did not, and students <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss</b> obtained slightly poorer first degrees than students with no reported disability; however, both of these results were due to differences in background variables. <b>A</b> hearing <b>loss</b> per se appears to have no effect on academic attainment...|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{study examined the}} characteristics, needs, and experiences of low-income Latino families with school-age children <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss</b> who attend <b>a</b> Los Angeles-based after school program focused on parent education. Latino parents self-reported the challenges they face having <b>a</b> child <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss</b> in their family, and the lessons learned and applied at home to support their child <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss's</b> development of communication skills. The outcomes of the study support current research in deafness highlighting {{the lack of information}} that parents receive once their child is diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss,</b> and their need for continual parent education throughout the child's critical language development years (0 - 6 years) as well as the school-age years. The outcomes of the study uncover salient information about the needs of low-income Latino families <b>with</b> children <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss</b> and highlight the benefits of an after school program focused on ongoing parent education and support groups...|$|R

40|$|This survey-based Australian study {{contributes}} to the small contemporary literature on the problems that people <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss</b> face in the labour force and some solutions to them. It focuses not only on barriers to labour force participation and success, {{but also on the}} things that help people <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss</b> to overcome those barriers and succeed. The study is unique {{in the sense that the}} only studies published since 2000 have concentrated on people <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss,</b> and both of those studies used administrative data from a US job placement scheme for people <b>with</b> <b>a</b> disability. There have apparently been no recent studies that ask people <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss</b> about their own experiences finding, retaining, and being successful at work. This study thus fills a surprising gap in the contemporary literature...|$|R

The club failed to retain the Champions League (losing to Juventus in the semi-finals) and the Copa del Rey, and also failed to land the league title (finishing two points and a place behind champions Barcelona), shortcomings that all preceded Ancelotti's sacking on 25 May 2015.|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the representation and attainment of students <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss</b> was carried out, based upon students who were registered on undergraduate courses at the Open University during 1996. Students <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss</b> were older, {{were more likely to}} be female and had begun their studies <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower level of prior education than students with no reported disability. They also differed in the number, workload, level and subject of the courses that they were taking, and they passed fewer courses and gained fewer credit points than students with no reported disability. There were, however, no differences between these two groups of students on any measure of academic outcome when differences in demographic features or academic level were taken into account. Students <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss</b> who reported some other disability were similar on both demographic and course-related variables to students <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hearing <b>loss</b> alone, but they tended to show poorer attainment on a variety of outcome measures...|$|R
