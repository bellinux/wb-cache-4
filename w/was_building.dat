5|$|A {{railroad}} link to Aspen {{was therefore}} {{likely to be}} highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, hoped to be the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed able to do so. The Midland was a paper railroad with no money to build anything. The Rio Grande <b>was</b> <b>building,</b> but too quickly, forcing it into receivership. Financially cautious from its recent troubles, it chose not to build to Aspen despite its president's enthusiasm for the project.|$|E
5|$|After {{the sale}} the {{building}} was mainly used for storage whilst planning applications to convert it into a hotel were made in 1986, 1993, and 2001, {{with varying degrees of}} success. The coroner's court was the last to vacate the premises, in 1998. In 2001, {{the building was}} placed on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register. By 2004 it was in steep decline, and momentum <b>was</b> <b>building</b> for the fire station's owner, Britannia Hotels, to act.|$|E
5|$|Between 1959 and 1962, Balabushka {{handcrafted}} between 20 and 30 cues {{per year}} on a part-time basis. Because of the relative dearth of private cuemakers and the excellence of his product, Balabushka's name quickly became known amongst professional players. By the end of 1962, Balabushka was receiving more orders for cues than he could fill given his time constraints. Balabushka accordingly sold {{his interest in the}} pool room, converted his garage into a carpentry shop, and by 1964 <b>was</b> <b>building</b> cues full-time, while continuing to hone his cuemaking abilities.|$|E

These <b>buildings</b> <b>are</b> legally protected from demolition, {{as well as}} from any extensions or alterations that would adversely affect the building's character or destroy historic features. Listed <b>buildings</b> in England <b>are</b> divided into three categories—Grade II <b>buildings</b> <b>are</b> <b>buildings</b> of special interest; Grade II* <b>buildings</b> <b>are</b> <b>buildings</b> of particular importance; and Grade I <b>buildings,</b> which <b>are</b> those of [...] "exceptional" [...] interest.

5|$|Bolton manager Sam Allardyce, who <b>was</b> <b>building</b> a {{reputation}} for signing unwanted foreign veterans such as N'Gotty, Djorkaeff and Iván Campo, predicted that a win would help him sign more players in the summer. However, he thought that success would also lead his 13 players who {{would be out of}} contract, to demand more money for a renewal.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the state}} <b>was</b> <b>building</b> a {{beltline}} system for Grand Rapids. This highway, numbered M-114 was decommissioned by 1945 {{and the streets}} that composed it were given new designations. Byp. M-21 was routed along 28th Street from Grandville to Paris Township and along East Beltline into Grand Rapids Township. In 1953, the mainline M-21 was rerouted to replace its bypass around downtown, decommissioning the Byp. M-21 designation.|$|E
5|$|In architecture, Filippo Brunelleschi was {{foremost}} {{in studying the}} remains of ancient classical buildings. With rediscovered knowledge from the 1st-century writer Vitruvius and the flourishing discipline of mathematics, Brunelleschi formulated the Renaissance style that emulated and improved on classical forms. His major feat of engineering <b>was</b> <b>building</b> {{the dome of the}} Florence Cathedral. Another building demonstrating this style is the church of St. Andrew in Mantua, built by Alberti. The outstanding architectural work of the High Renaissance was the rebuilding of St. Peter's Basilica, combining the skills of Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael, Sangallo and Maderno.|$|E
5000|$|There are 25 Grade II* listed {{buildings}} in the City of Coventry.

In 1937, he invested his earnings into a pub for which his future wife, Eunice Henriksen, had the lease.|$|E
5|$|Medical issues forced Schweitzer {{to leave}} Africa many times, and {{sometimes}} Albert {{kept her from}} returning at times. When Albert {{decided to return to}} Africa in 1924, he took on Oxford undergraduate, Noel Gillespie, as assistant, leaving Schweitzer behind. After the birth of their daughter (Rhena Schweitzer Miller), Schweitzer was no longer able to live in Lambaréné owing to her health. In 1923 the family moved to Königsfeld im Schwarzwald, Baden-Württemberg, where Albert <b>was</b> <b>building</b> a house for the family. This house is now maintained as a Schweitzer museum.|$|E
5|$|The 1942–43 {{season was}} Bouchard's {{breakthrough}} year {{as he finished}} leading all Canadien defencemen in points and was key to the Canadiens' first season in several years without a losing record.

5|$|The Alaskas were officially {{funded in}} September 1940 {{along with a}} plethora of other ships {{as a part of}} the Two-Ocean Navy Act. Their role had been altered slightly: in {{addition}} to their surface-to-surface role, they were planned to protect carrier groups. Because of their bigger guns, greater size and increased speed, they would be more valuable in this role than heavy cruisers, and would provide insurance against reports that Japan <b>was</b> <b>building</b> super cruisers more powerful than U.S. heavy cruisers.|$|E
5|$|The Courtyard Cafe and The Fountain {{located within}} the Library also became an institution, well-patronised by library users, office workers and the local arts {{community}} from The Substation. As such, many fond memories were created for those who visited the compounds of the Library. At the same time, the pressure of urban redevelopment in the city <b>was</b> <b>building</b> up, resulting in demolishing of old city fabric that would threaten the Library building's fate and its sentimental memories in the ensuing years.|$|E
5|$|The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill made Wheeler an {{associate}} professor in 1937, but he wanted to be able work more closely with the experts in particle physics. He turned down an offer in 1938 of {{an associate}} professorship at Johns Hopkins University in favor of an assistant professorship at Princeton University. Although it was a lesser position, he felt that Princeton, which <b>was</b> <b>building</b> up its physics department, was a better career choice. He remained a member of the faculty there until 1976.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} of Dreadnought coincided with increasing {{tension between the}} United Kingdom and Germany. Germany had begun to build a large battlefleet in the 1890s, {{as part of a}} deliberate policy to challenge British naval supremacy. With the conclusion of the Entente Cordiale between the United Kingdom and France in April 1904, it became increasingly clear that the United Kingdom's principal naval enemy would be Germany, which <b>was</b> <b>building</b> up a large, modern fleet under the 'Tirpitz' laws. This rivalry gave rise to the two largest dreadnought fleets of the pre-war period.|$|E
5|$|Upon leaving NASA in 1985, Lunney took a {{position}} at Rockwell International, the contractor responsible for the construction, operation and maintenance of the space shuttle. At first he worked in California, managing a Rockwell division that <b>was</b> <b>building</b> satellites for the Global Positioning System; this was his first experience with unmanned spacecraft. In 1990, he returned to Houston as President of the Rockwell Space Operations Company, which provided support for flight operations at Johnson Space Center and employed about 3000 people. For Lunney, this represented a return to his roots in mission operations, which he had left twenty years before.|$|E
5|$|With {{increased}} traffic, there {{soon became}} a capacity problem at Oslo Airport, Fornebu, the main hub for both SAS and Braathens. During the peak times during the morning and afternoon rush, there were no excess slots for new airlines. To compensate, the Norwegian Airport Administration <b>was</b> <b>building</b> a new main airport for Eastern Norway, to be located at Gardermoen. A larger terminal and two runways would give ample room for expansion, and entry of new airlines. The new airport opened on 8 October 1998.|$|E

5|$|Accordingly, William de Valence {{began to}} build a much larger castle around the {{original}} keep from the 1280s onwards, demolishing Marshal's earlier work. As part of the extremely expensive construction work, Valence used oak trees drawn from several royal forests. Valence <b>was</b> <b>building</b> {{at the same time}} that his nephew Edward I was constructing his major castles in the north of Wales, and the concentric castle that he built at Goodrich is both very similar in design and a rarity in England itself. Valence's son, Aymer de Valence built an additional line of outer defences before his death in 1324, including the external barbican, inspired by that at the Tower of London, and for which the earlier Valence barbican at Pembroke may have been an experimental forerunner. The effect was an early success in converting a fortress into a major dwelling, without damaging its defensive arrangements, and influenced the later castle conversion at Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Marmaduke was academically {{gifted and}} also a keen boxer and long-distance swimmer. He also took a keen {{interest}} in mechanical things, particularly combustion engines, and <b>was</b> <b>building</b> Meccano models of aircraft and other vehicles by the age of 12. In his early teens, he became an avid amateur mechanic, fixing the family motor car and learning to drive. Marmaduke was never a hard worker and did not embark upon an academic career, but was considered to possess above average intelligence. In 1929, he passed the Junior Certificate Exam with first class honours. The certificate qualified him for Victoria Boy's High School from which he graduated in 1931.|$|E
5|$|At that time, {{the only}} Finnish heavy vehicle {{producer}} Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab (SAT) <b>was</b> <b>building</b> a new factory in Karis, a location considered {{less likely than}} Helsinki to come under attack from Soviet air raids. Company general director Tor Nessling suggested the factory should be larger than originally planned. As another option, Nessling, with extreme reservation, considered building a new factory elsewhere in Finland. SAT was experienced in heavy vehicle production but economic and technical resources were limited. Heavy vehicle importers and some political cliques thought SAT was trying {{to benefit from the}} war and to gain a dominant position in the Finnish market.|$|E
