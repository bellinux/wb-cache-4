5|$|He was in Marseille in late 1940-early 1941, {{joining the}} group of anti-fascist and Jewish {{refugees}} who, protected by American diplomat Varian Fry, were seeking to escape Nazi-occupied Europe. Among the people present there were the anti-totalitarian socialist Victor Serge, anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, playwright Arthur Adamov, philosopher and poet René Daumal, and several prominent Surrealists: Breton, Char, and Benjamin Péret, as well as artists Max Ernst, André Masson, Wifredo Lam, Jacques Hérold, Victor Brauner and Óscar Domínguez. During the months spent together, and before some of them received permission to leave for America, they invented a new card game, on <b>which</b> <b>traditional</b> card imagery was replaced with Surrealist symbols.|$|E
5|$|Much of Durkheim's {{work was}} {{concerned}} with how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in modernity; an era in <b>which</b> <b>traditional</b> social and religious ties are no longer assumed, and in which new social institutions have come into being. His first major sociological work was The Division of Labour in Society (1893). In 1895, he published The Rules of Sociological Method {{and set up the}} first European department of sociology, becoming France's first professor of sociology. In 1898, he established the journal L'Année Sociologique. Durkheim's seminal monograph, Suicide (1897), a study of suicide rates in Catholic and Protestant populations, pioneered modern social research and served to distinguish social science from psychology and political philosophy. The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1912) presented a theory of religion, comparing the social and cultural lives of aboriginal and modern societies.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario RPG {{contains}} token {{similarities to}} other Square-developed video games, such as the Final Fantasy series, along with a story and gameplay based on the Super Mario Bros. series of platform games. Like most traditional JRPGs, {{there are two main}} sections to the game: adventuring and turn-based battle sequences. Much of Super Mario RPGs gameplay is outside monster battles and plays like an isometric 3D platformer, in <b>which</b> <b>traditional</b> Mario elements such as punching floating question blocks from below are prominent. There are no random encounters and as such enemies are visible in the field; a battle ensues only if Mario comes in contact with one. This allows the player to evade unnecessary battles.|$|E

25|$|May Day {{has been}} a {{traditional}} day of festivities throughout the centuries, most associated with towns and villages celebrating springtime fertility (of the soil, livestock, and people) and revelry with village fetes and community gatherings.

Perhaps the most significant of the traditions is the maypole, around <b>which</b> <b>traditional</b> dancers circle with ribbons.|$|E

25|$|Despite this {{it appears}} that the final {{breakthrough}} of paper depended just as much on the rapid spread of movable-type printing. It is notable that codices of parchment, which in terms of quality is superior to any other writing material, still had a substantial share in Gutenberg's edition of the 42-line Bible. After much experimentation, Gutenberg managed to overcome the difficulties <b>which</b> <b>traditional</b> water-based inks caused by soaking the paper, and found the formula for an oil-based ink suitable for high-quality printing with metal type.|$|E
25|$|Poincaré, {{following}} Gauss, Lobachevsky, Bernhard Riemann and others, viewed geometric {{models as}} mere conventions {{rather than as}} absolute. Euclidean geometry, upon <b>which</b> <b>traditional</b> perspective had been founded, was but one geometric configuration among others. Non-Euclidean geometry, with its hyperbolic or spherically curved space, was thus, at the very least, an equally valid alternative. This discovery {{in the world of}} mathematics overthrew 2000 years of seeming absolutes in Euclidean geometry, and threw into question conventional Renaissance perspective by suggesting the possible existence of multi-dimensional worlds and perspectives in which things might look very different.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{actuarial science}} {{developed}} along a different path, becoming more reliant on assumptions, {{as opposed to}} the arbitrage-free risk-neutral valuation concepts used in modern finance. The divergence is not related to the use of historical data and statistical projections of liability cash flows, but is instead caused by the manner in <b>which</b> <b>traditional</b> actuarial methods apply market data with those numbers. For example, one traditional actuarial method suggests that changing the asset allocation mix of investments can change the value of liabilities and assets (by changing the discount rate assumption). This concept is inconsistent with financial economics.|$|E

25|$|Public {{transportation}} {{vehicles are}} not usually included in the green vehicle category, but Personal rapid transit (PRT) vehicles probably should be. All vehicles that are powered from the track {{have the advantage of}} potentially being able to use any source of electric energy, including sustainable ones, rather than requiring liquid fuels. They can also switch regenerative braking energy between vehicles and the electric grid rather than requiring energy storage on the vehicles. Also, they can potentially use the entire track area for solar collectors, not just the vehicle surface. The potential PRT energy efficiency is much higher than that <b>which</b> <b>traditional</b> automobiles can attain.|$|E
25|$|A {{modeling}} {{system based on}} {{a better understanding of}} the termination targeting of lightning, called the Rolling Sphere Method, was developed by Dr Tibor Horváth. It has become the standard by <b>which</b> <b>traditional</b> Franklin Rod systems are installed. To understand this requires knowledge of how lightning 'moves'. As the step leader of a lightning bolt jumps toward the ground, it steps toward the grounded objects nearest its path. The maximum distance that each step may travel is called the critical distance and is proportional to the electric current. Objects are likely to be struck if they are nearer to the leader than this critical distance. It is standard practice to approximate the sphere's radius as 46m near the ground.|$|E
25|$|Another area in <b>which</b> <b>traditional</b> Korean naming {{practices}} {{clashed with}} Russian custom {{was in the}} use of surnames by married couples. In Russia, a wife traditionally takes her husband's surname after marriage, whereas Korean women retain their original surname even after marriage. In this regard, the Koryo-saram appear to have kept to Korean tradition much more closely, rather than adopting the Russian practice; for example, out of 18 ethnic Korean babies born in the Kalinin district of Alma Ata, Kazakhstan in 1980, 10 were to parents with different surnames, possibly indicating the extent of this practice. However, adoption of the husband's surname by the wife is not a universal custom among Russians either, and deviations from it are viewed as normal.|$|E

25|$|But it is {{possible}} that the politicians of the 1850s were not inept. More recent studies have kept elements of the revisionist interpretation alive, emphasizing the role of political agitation (the efforts of Democratic politicians of the South and Republican politicians in the North to keep the sectional conflict at the center of the political debate). David Herbert Donald (1920–2009), a student of Randall, argued in 1960 that the politicians of the 1850s were not unusually inept but that they were operating in a society in <b>which</b> <b>traditional</b> restraints were being eroded in the face of the rapid extension of democracy. The stability of the two-party system kept the union together, but would collapse in the 1850s, thus reinforcing, rather than suppressing, sectional conflict. The union, Donald said, died of democracy.|$|E
25|$|Some {{rounds of}} the season are named as themed rounds, such as Rivalry Round (in <b>which</b> <b>traditional</b> rivals are matched up against each other), Women's Round and Heritage Round (where teams play in old style guernseys). Some matches are also themed for special events. For example, each year Collingwood play Essendon in the annual Anzac Day clash at the MCG and the game will {{typically}} sell out regardless of {{the positions of the}} two teams on the ladder due to their strong rivalry and huge followings. Another annual match is the Queen's Birthday game between Melbourne and Collingwood. , Richmond and Essendon play in the Dreamtime at the 'G match. There are separate trophies for the matches between several clubs and former rivalries such as the Lake Trophy between St Kilda and the Sydney Swans.|$|E
25|$|The {{prospect}} of a truly national rugby league competition {{in addition to the}} introduction of pay television in Australia attracted the attention of global media organisation, News Corporation, and it followed that professional rugby league was shaken to its very foundations in the mid-1990s {{with the advent of the}} Super League war. Initially a conflict over broadcasting rights, it became a dispute as to who controlled the sport and <b>which</b> <b>traditional</b> clubs would survive into the new national era, as News Limited formed their own Super League and admitted some former ARL clubs, poaching players from the original ARL league with high salaries. With twenty-two teams of highly varying quality playing in two competitions that year, crowd attendances and corporate sponsorships were spread very thinly, and many teams found themselves in financial difficulty. The ARL undertook moves to invite the traditional clubs that had moved to the Super League competition back into a re-unified competition. Following a period of negotiation with News Corporation, on 23 September 1997 the ARL announced that it was forming a new company to conduct the competition in 1998. On 7 October News' Manaaki Ranginui announced that he was confident that there would be a single competition in 1998. On 19 December, representatives of clubs affiliated with the Australian Rugby League gathered at the Sydney Football Stadium to decide whether to accept News Limited's offer of a settlement – eventually voting in favour by 36 votes to 4. As a result, in the following months the National Rugby League, jointly owned by the ARL and News Limited, was formed.|$|E

Maier writes that this understanding {{is not limited to}} the language used, but also actions; this includes holding hands in public and drinking lemonade, activities <b>which</b> <b>traditional</b> Indonesian society does not involve. Student Hidjo also contrasts Dutch and Javanese peoples. Maier finds that, through its alternating events, the novel shows that the Dutch and Javanese are incompatible; Maeir sums it up as [...] "Javanese do not feel at ease in Holland, [...] Dutch do not feel at ease in Java." [...] According to Maier, the novel views the gap between the two cultures as [...] "unbridgeable".|$|E
500|$|Luhr (2009) {{states that}} Christian metal expresses feeling of {{isolation}} and rebellion just like non-Christian metal - but {{in a completely different}} way. Christian metal's rebellion is about [...] "Christian opposition to the perceived sinfulness and immorality of a late modern society and culture in <b>which</b> <b>traditional</b> family values have been eroded through such things as the legalization and increasing acceptability of abortion and pornography and the rise of gay rights and feminist movements." [...] Causes for the feeling of isolation can be explained with the fundamental Christian struggle of being in the world but not of it. Bloodgood and Barren Cross inverted the meaning of rebellion by declaring that in Western society and culture the Christian faith is true rebellion. As in non-Christian metal, fans are encouraged to stand up for their faith, think for themselves and not blindly follow authorities, including religious ones.|$|E
