In this context, a commercial stainless steel, K 41 X (AISI 441), {{was chosen as}} interconnect. In a previous paper, the high temperature corrosion and the electrical conductivity were evaluated in both anode (O- 2 -H 2 O) and cathode (H- 2 -H 2 O) atmosphere at 800 degrees C. In O- 2 -H 2 O atmosphere, {{the formation of a}} thin chromia protective layer was observed. Nevertheless, the ASR parameter measured was higher than the maximum accepted value. These results, in addition with chromium evaporation measurements, proved that the K 41 X alloy is not suitable for HTE interconnect application. In this study, two perovskite-type oxides La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 MnO 3 -delta and LaNi 0. 6 Fe 0. 4 O 3 -delta were tested as coatings in O- 2 -H 2 O atmosphere at 800 degrees C. Screen-printing and physical vapour deposition were used as coating processes. The high temperature corrosion resistance and the electrical conductivity were improved, especially with the LaNi 0. 6 Fe 0. 4 O 3 -delta coating. Cr specie volatility was also reduced.

More than 99 % of <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> is located in the troposphere where it significantly contributes to atmospheric chemistry, weather, and climate [1].

The importance of <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> has generated the need for global <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> data. The main sources for <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> data are currently in situ radio sonde measurements, space borne IR measurements, for example by the TIROS-N Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS), and microwave soundings, for example with the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), see e. g.

The obtained data set allows case studies and detailed characterization of stratospheric <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> vertical distribution within different conditions in the Arctic polar stratosphere. <b>Water</b> <b>vapour</b> vertical distribution in the Arctic lower stratosphere is primarily affected by the dynamical effects of polar vortex and by phase aggregation at the temperatures below ice PSC threshold.

The measurements clearly demonstrate typical differences in stratospheric <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> concentration {{inside and outside the}} vortex; for example in the polar vortex of 2003 / 04 at 20 hPa the difference reaches 1. 4 ppmv. Also it is pointed out that <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> profiles obtained at the edge or close to the edge of vortex are characteristic by their laminated structure.

Taking into account the large temporal and spatial variability of <b>water</b> <b>vapour,</b> the SCIAMACHY results agree well with these correlative data not only over ocean but also over land, thus showing the capability of SCIAMACHY to provide a new independent global <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> data set...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} hempcrete, an {{environmentally}} friendly material, which is told {{to have good}} thermal and hydric properties. It {{is part of a}} program which aims to improve manufacturing process and performances of the material. This paper deals with hydric properties of the reference material (wall hempcrete mixe). The samples are taken from blocks manufactured by spraying. The investigations are based on experimental studies of porous structure, <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> sorption and <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> permeability. <b>Water</b> <b>vapour</b> sorption is measured at 23 °C according to discontinuous method and <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> permeability is obtained with cup method. <b>Water</b> <b>vapour</b> sorption is then used in order to characterize porous structure: sorption curve is S-shaped and can be classified as type II or III according to IUPAC classification (IUPAC, 1986). Such kind of shape is related to macroporous materials, that is in agreement with porous studies. Then, sorption curve is fitted with several models (GAB, BET (Brunauer & al., 1938) [...] .) in order to calculate specific surface area. Sprayed hempcrete shows specific surface area about 120 m²/g. More, <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> permeability and sorption curve are used together in order to calculate <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> diffusivity (values about 1. E- 10 to 1. E- 8 m²/s). The plot of <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> diffusivity against <b>water</b> content is in agreement with De Vries theory. Results are closed to those obtained on moulded hempcrete...|$|R
40|$|Balloon-borne {{frost point}} {{hygrometers}} measured three high-resolution profiles of stratospheric <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> above Ny-Ålesund, Spitsbergen during winter 2002 / 2003. The profiles obtained on 12 December 2002 and on 17 January 2003 provide {{an insight into}} the vertical distribution of <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> {{in the core of}} the polar vortex. The <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> sounding on 11 February 2003 was obtained within the vortex edge region of the lower stratosphere. Here, a significant reduction of <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> mixing ratio was observed between 16 and 19 km. The stratospheric temperatures indicate that this dehydration was not caused by the presence of polar stratospheric clouds or earlier PSC particle sedimentation. Ozone observations on this day indicate a large scale movement of the polar vortex and show laminae in the same altitude range as the <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> profile. The link between the observed <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> reduction and filaments in the vortex edge region is indicated in the results of the semi-lagrangian advection model MIMOSA, which show that adjacent filaments of polar and mid latitude air can be identified above the Spitsbergen region. A vertical cross-section produced by the MIMOSA model reveals that the <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> sonde flew through polar air in the lowest part of the stratosphere below 425 K, then passed through filaments of mid latitude air with lower <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> concentrations, before it finally entered the polar vortex above 450 K. These results indicate that on 11 February 2003 the frost point hygrometer measured different <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> concentrations as the sonde detected air with different origins. Instead of being linked to dehydration due to PSC particle sedimentation, the local reduction in the stratospheric <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> profile was in this case caused by dynamical processes in the polar stratosphere...|$|R
40|$|Using {{the monthly}} Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim) {{provided}} by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> transported by the large-scale circulation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP hereafter) {{for the period of}} 1979 - 2014 has been investigated. The TP is divided into five boundaries by a reference to the 3000 m contour, and the flux of horizontally and vertically integrated atmospheric <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> over the TP with its surrounding has been calculated. The time-averaged vertically integrated <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> fluxes enter the TP through the southern, southwestern, western and northern boundaries with the southern boundary contributing 414. 8 × 106 kg s- 1. And <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> transport is not simply input or output through one boundary. The time-averaged fluxes of <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> on each layer show that <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> transport to the outside/inside TP comes from different level (above/below 600 Pa) of the eastern boundary and the main exchange of <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> occurred below the level of 500 Pa, which cannot reach the higher layer of the southern and northern boundary. There is an outflow region from 76 °E to 83 °E on the vertical section of northern boundary. It {{may be related to the}} topography blocking effect of northwestern TP. Then, we chose Regional Westerly and Webster and Yang monsoon indices to describe the mid-latitude westerly and the South Asian Monsoon, respectively. Through the correlation coefficient between the vertically integrated <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> transport flux and two circulation indices, it is found that in the same area, the influence of mid-latitude westerly shows the opposite effect of the South Asian Monsoon. In years of strong/weak mid-latitude westerly or weak/strong South Asian Monsoon, the <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> transport from northern boundary becomes stronger/weaker and from southern boundary becomes weaker/stronger. Here, the <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> transport processes are revealed to the influence of two large-scale circulation systems. © 2016 Royal Meteorological Society...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Atmospheric {{surface layer}} (ASL) {{experiments}} {{over the past}} 10 years demonstrate that the flux-variance similarity functions for <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> are consistently larger in magnitude than their temperature counterpart. In addition, latent heat flux calculations using the flux-variance method do not compare as favorably to eddy-correlation measurements when compared to their sensible heat counterpart. These two findings, in concert with measured heat to <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> transport efficien-cies in excess of unity, are commonly used as evidence of dissimilarity between heat and <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> transport in the unstable atmospheric surface layer. In this note, it is demonstrated that even if near equality in flux-profile similarity functions for heat and <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> is satisfied, the flux-variance similarity functions for <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> are larger in magnitude than temperature for a planar, homogeneous, unstably-stratified, turbulent boundary-layer flow...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} stratospheric <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> {{data set}} has been derived from SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT solar occultation measurements. It {{is based on}} the same algorithm which has already been successfully applied to methane and carbon dioxide retrievals, thus resulting in a consistent data set for theses three constituents covering the altitudes 17 – 45  km, the latitude range between about 50 and 70 ° N, and the time interval August 2002 to April 2012. The new <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> data agree with collocated results from ACE-FTS and MLS/Aura within about 5  %. A significant positive <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> trend for the time 2003 – 2011 is observed at lower stratospheric altitudes of about 0. 015 ppmv/year around 17  km. Between 30 and 37  km the trends become significantly negative (about − 0. 01  ppmv/year). The combined analysis of the SCIAMACHY methane and <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> time series reveals that stratospheric methane and <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> are strongly correlated and show a clear temporal variation related to the Quasi-Biannual-Oscillation (QBO). Above about 20  km most of the <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> seems to be produced by methane, but short-term fluctuations and a temporal variation on a scale of 5 – 6 years are observed. At lower altitudes the balance between <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> and methane is affected by stratospheric transport of <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> and methane from the tropics to higher latitudes via the shallow branch of the Brewer-Dobson circulation and by the increasing methane input into the stratosphere due to the rise of tropospheric methane after 2007...|$|R
40|$|Datasets of {{radiative}} fluxes at TOA and <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> content observations, both {{obtained from}} space measurementsand {{for a period}} of several years (since 2004 till now), are available from CM-SAF. Despite being a fairlyshort time period to draw conclusions about climate changes, it is possible to perform a correlation analysis ontrends and on space-time variability between the radiation budget at TOA and <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> content, based onexclusively polar and geostationary satellite datasets. In this work monthly data of thermal radiative fluxes at TOA and <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> content from CM-SAF, coveringan area that comprises Europe, Africa and the Atlantic Ocean, are simultaneously analysed. A previous analysis of <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> content, derived from CM-SAF dataset, have shown positive trends, withdifferent values for land and sea areas, with a good consistency with literature (e. g. IPCC reports). Because of thestrong effect of <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> on the thermal emitted radiative flow, the correlation between them is confirmed. Moreover, by using some multivariate statistical techniques, the space variability between <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> and OLRfields has been analysed. Results have confirmed their reciprocal coupling...|$|R
40|$|In {{thesis is}} dealt with {{problematic}} {{of how the}} value of air permeability may be affected by properties for <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> diffusion with regard to OSB material There were chosen two main brands of OSB at Czech trade market Two specimens of OSB with different thickness were chosen for each brand. As a first the specimens were tested for air tightness {{to work out a}} value of air permeability for each specimen. Afterwords, the testing was conducted for gaining properties of <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> diffusion on each specimen. As a final assessment was analysed the impact of properties of <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> diffusion on the air tightness for each specimen. The general meaning of gaining higher air tightness with higher <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> resistance was proved. It was shown that with raising thickness is usually gotten higher value of <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> diffusion resistance. However it could not mean getting high air tightness. The crucial parameter is the quality of the material for gaining higher resistance against <b>water</b> <b>vapour</b> diffusion as well as for higher airtightness...|$|R
