5|$|Issues {{regarding}} {{debt and}} revenue-sharing <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles {{eventually led to}} the dissolution of the territory and its division as constituent islands Curaçao and Sint Maarten claimed a status of autonomy similar to that of Aruba, while the islands Bonaire, Saba, and Sint Eustatius were absorbed directly into the Netherlands. Thus, the 2008 Summer Olympics served as the final Olympics games in which the Netherlands Antilles participated as a territory. The future of the Dutch Antillean athletes to participate in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London were cast into doubt as a result. As residents of the Netherlands Antilles hold Dutch passports, IAAF General Secretary Pierre Weiss remarked all former Dutch Antillean athletes should immediately become eligible to represent the Netherlands in the Netherlands Antilles' stead. Ultimately, however, the IOC decided in its 123rd session upon three items: that former Dutch Antillean athletes would compete independently under the Olympic flag; that recognition for the Netherlands Antilles' Olympic Committee was to be withdrawn; and that a temporary administrative structure would serve in the Dutch Antillean NOC's place until after the 2012 London games, directly supervised and supported by the IOC.|$|E

25|$|The first {{efforts to}} formalise the {{language}} {{began in the}} early 1970s, with the first step made in 1969 in Curaçao. R.G. Römer presented to the Central Government of the Netherlands Antilles his Ontwerp van een spelling voor het Papyamento (Draft of a spelling for Papyamento). In 1970 the Maduro Commission consisting of eight members, R.G. Römer included, was formed. With a modified proposition, they presented their recommendations to the Minister of Education of the Netherlands Antilles. With further revision, the minister's recommendations were passed onto the Deputy of Education of Curaçao in 1975. Here a Jonis Commission was formed to advise the Curaçaoan government on the didactic aspects of the Römer-Maduro orthography. It was also in 1975 that the Central Government decided that each island <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles could choose their orthography. In 1976, Curaçao officially adopted the Römer-Maduro-Jonis version while Aruba had approved a version presented by the Comision di Ortografia (Orthography Commission) presided by Jossy Mansur. This was officially adopted in 1977.|$|E
25|$|Dutch dialects are {{primarily}} the dialects {{that are both}} related with the Dutch language and are spoken in the same language area as the Dutch standard language. Although heavily {{under the influence of}} the standard language, some of them remain remarkably diverse and are found in the Netherlands and northern Belgium. The area where they are spoken often correspond with former mediaeval counties and duchies. The Netherlands (but not Belgium) makes a distinction between a dialect and a streektaal ("regional language"). These words are actually more political than linguistic, because a regional language unite a large group of very differing varieties. Such is the case with the Gronings dialect, which is considered a variety of the Dutch Low Saxon regional language, but is in fact very distinct from other Low Saxon varieties due to a Frisian substrate. Also, some Dutch dialects are more remote from the Dutch standard language than some varieties of a regional language are. Such is the case with West Flemish, which is considered a Dutch dialect but is far more remote from the standard language than most Dutch Low Saxon varieties are. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands,</b> a further distinction is made between a regional language and a separate language, which is the case with the (standardised) West Frisian language. It is spoken next to Dutch in the province of Friesland.|$|E

40|$|This essay has two goals. First, it {{traces the}} {{different}} {{meanings of the}} ‘Northern Netherlands’. Regional and national policymakers used this geographical notion after the second World War {{in order to develop}} regions. However, they lost the capability to dominate the (positive) connotation from the 1960 s onwards. Other domains of society, such as science and journalism, framed the term in their own way. Due to disappointed expectations about economic policies, the ‘Northern Netherlands’ got a negative significance. Second, the essay unfolds a critique of both the positive and the negative meaning of the concept. Both frames are guilty of oversimplication. Moreover, older connotations of <b>the</b> Northern <b>Netherlands</b> do not fit the reality of sub-regionalization within this part of <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands.</b> A new meaning of the ‘Northern Netherlands’ can only be found in the acceptance of <b>the</b> regional variety <b>within</b> <b>the</b> northern part of <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands.</b> <b>The</b> study of regional history can contribute to the process of sub-regionalization. With its capacity to analyze social, cultural and economic differences, it can increase our knowledge of <b>the</b> regions <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Northern <b>Netherlands...</b>|$|R
