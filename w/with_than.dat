5|$|The Stranges {{become a}} popular couple in London. Lady Pole and Strange's wife, Arabella, become friends and during one of her visits Arabella meets the gentleman with thistle-down hair, whom she assumes is a relative. The Cabinet ministers find Strange easier to deal <b>with</b> <b>than</b> Norrell, and they send him to assist the Duke of Wellington on his Peninsular Campaign. For over a year, Strange helps the army: he creates roads, moves towns, and makes dead men speak. After he returns, he fails to cure George III's madness, {{although}} Strange manages to save the king from the gentleman with thistle-down hair, who is determined to make Stephen a king. Strange then helps defeat Napoleon at the horrific Battle of Waterloo.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{of iron and}} its alloys can be evaluated {{using a variety of}} tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the Vickers hardness test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, the {{mechanical properties}} of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30Brinell. An increase in the carbon content will cause {{a significant increase in the}} hardness and tensile strength of iron. Maximum hardness of 65 Rc is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low tensile strength. Because of the softness of iron, it is much easier to work <b>with</b> <b>than</b> its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium.|$|E

25|$|This {{paper is}} also {{remarkable}} {{for the development}} of the idea of the scalar potential.

25|$|A tape ball is {{a tennis}} ball wrapped in {{electrical}} tape and is used in playing street cricket. This modification of the tennis ball gives it greater weight, speed and distance while still being easier to play <b>with</b> <b>than</b> the conventional cricket ball. The variation was pioneered in Karachi, Pakistan and is credited with Pakistan's famous production of fast bowlers as children are brought up playing the game using a tape ball in which various skills are developed. The increasing popularity of the tape ball in informal, local cricket has transformed the way games are played in cricket-loving nations such as India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh but most famously Pakistan. Such has been the impact of tape ball {{that in recent years}} some companies have introduced tennis balls designed to act like cricket balls. These balls are quite popular in South Asia where tape ball cricket {{is one of the most}} popular forms of the sport.|$|E
25|$|Butter fills several {{roles in}} baking, {{where it is}} used {{in a similar manner}} as other solid fats like lard, suet, or shortening, but has a flavor that may better {{complement}} sweet baked goods. Many cookie doughs and some cake batters are leavened, at least in part, by creaming butter and sugar together, which introduces air bubbles into the butter. The tiny bubbles locked within the butter expand in the heat of baking and aerate the cookie or cake. Some cookies like shortbread may have no other source of moisture but the water in the butter. Pastries like pie dough incorporate pieces of solid fat into the dough, which become flat layers of fat when the dough is rolled out. During baking, the fat melts away, leaving a flaky texture. Butter, because of its flavor, is a common choice for the fat in such a dough, but it can be more difficult to work <b>with</b> <b>than</b> shortening because of its low melting point. Pastry makers often chill all their ingredients and utensils while working with a butter dough.|$|E

500|$|Many years later, authors Timothy Burke and Kevin Burke {{wrote in}} Saturday Morning Fever: Growing Up with Cartoon Culture called the show a [...] "special treat" [...] and {{appreciated}} it {{for being able}} to parody [...] "pop culture stables" [...] cleverly.

They also speculated that Wishbone (1995–1997) contained the same premise as The Secret Lives of Waldo Kitty, but with a dog as the main character instead of a cat. Producer Scheimer was hugely disappointed by the entire series, calling it [...] "a mistake on many levels".|$|E
500|$|In the {{original}} series, Tom Swift lives in fictional Shopton, New York. He {{is the son}} of Barton Swift, the founder of the Swift Construction Company. Tom's mother is deceased, but the housekeeper, Mrs. Baggert, functions as a surrogate mother. Tom usually shares his adventures with close friend Ned Newton, who eventually becomes the Swift Construction Company's financial manager. For most of the series, Tom dates Mary Nestor. It has been suggested that his eventual marriage to Mary led to the series' demise, as young boys found a married man harder to identify <b>with</b> <b>than</b> a young, single one; however, after the 1929 marriage the series continued for 12 more years and eight further volumes.
