5|$|In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio {{claimed to}} have {{discovered}} a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio. While this news was met <b>with</b> <b>excitement</b> at first, scholars—after reading the work—began {{to argue that the}} manuscript was a fraud, with humanist Antonio Riccoboni being among the most vocal. However, Sigonio continued to defend the work until his death, even mentioning in two different orations his belief in the truthfulness of the text. The scholar Latino Latini, however, later claimed in a letter that Sigonio had admitted to the forgery on his deathbed. By and large, the academic community concluded that the version of the Consolatio discovered was not genuine, and the document later earned the name the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio.|$|E

The game, initially developed as a joke prototype from an internal game jam and shown in an early alpha state in YouTube videos, was met <b>with</b> <b>excitement</b> and attention, prompting the studio to build out the game into a releasable state while still retaining various non-breaking bugs and glitches to maintain the game's entertainment value.|$|E
5|$|Walpole's {{taste for}} {{adventure}} did not diminish {{in his last}} years. In 1939 he was commissioned to report for William Randolph Hearst's newspapers on the funeral in Rome of Pope Pius XI, the conclave to elect his successor, and the subsequent coronation. A fellow correspondent was Tom Driberg, whose memoirs tell of a lunch à deux at which Walpole arrived flushed <b>with</b> <b>excitement</b> from a sexual encounter that morning with an attendant in the Borghese Palace. In the weeks between the funeral and Pius XII's election Walpole, with his customary fluency, wrote much of his book Roman Fountain, a mixture of fact and fiction about the city. This was his last overseas visit.|$|E

5|$|Three years later, when Elsa {{becomes a}} young adult, she {{is set to}} be crowned queen. The people of Arendelle are joyously {{preparing}} for her coronation day. Anna is flushed <b>with</b> <b>excitement</b> as the castle gates are opened {{for the first time}} since the sisters' childhood. The young princess expresses how cheerful she is when she leaves her lonely life and meets people, as well as her hopes to find romance and a love interest. While exploring the town, Anna bumps into a horse owned by Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Despite the awkward meeting at first, the pair quickly get acquainted and develop a mutual attraction for each other. Though Elsa fears of her secret being revealed to the public, her coronation goes on without incident. At the reception party, Anna is offered a waltz from Hans and the two have a date around the kingdom. They later find out that they have much in common, and Anna agrees to Hans' marriage proposal. Anna asks for Elsa's blessing to marry Hans, but she refuses and criticizes her for engaging with someone she has just met. This raises an argument between the two with Anna losing her temper, culminating in Elsa getting angry and accidentally exposing her abilities. Upon the guests' (including Anna) horrified reactions, Elsa flees the castle in panic and goes into hiding in the icy mountains. During her retreat, she inadvertently unleashes an eternal winter throughout Arendelle. Far from there, Elsa decides to let go her powers and build an enormous ice palace. Anna, believing it's her fault, determines to find her sister and bring her back, leaving Hans in charge of Arendelle.|$|E

500|$|Boult had striven to {{maintain}} the orchestra's standards and prestige during the war; as an instance of its prowess in the 1940s Kennedy cites an HMV recording of Elgar's Second Symphony released in January 1945: [...] "a performance that blazed <b>with</b> <b>excitement</b> and passion and is documentary evidence of the excellence of the orchestra in 1944". With Reith long gone from the post of director-general, Boult found that the top management of the BBC was less concerned for the status of its Symphony Orchestra. The new director-general, Sir William Haley, was unwilling to approve the funding {{needed to keep the}} orchestra competitive with new rivals – Walter Legge's Philharmonia and Beecham's Royal Philharmonic. Some younger players felt that many BBC SO principals were past their best. [...] Steuart Wilson, the new Director of Music who had previously been married to Boult's wife Ann, engineered Boult's retirement in 1950, Wilson had neglected to secure a successor of similar eminence to take over the orchestra. His efforts to recruit Sir John Barbirolli and Rafael Kubelík were unsuccessful, and he was obliged to offer the post to his third choice, Sir Malcolm Sargent, on whatever terms Sargent demanded.|$|E

500|$|The Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department {{considers}} a potential sponsorship deal with Sweetums, a local candy manufacturer hoping to market [...] "nutritious" [...] snack bars to park visitors. Ron (Nick Offerman) supports the deal as he advocates governmental privatization and emphasizes consumer choice over public safety. Leslie (Amy Poehler) initially supports the deal as well, until Ann (Rashida Jones) informs her they {{are filled with}} unhealthy corn syrup. Leslie arranges a public forum for Pawnee park visitors {{so they can make}} an informed choice about Sweetums products. Ron is unhappy with the arrangement, and gets angry with Leslie worrying about how much he is drinking during a recent outing, feeling she is stifling his personal freedoms. During the forum, Sweetums representatives screen propaganda films, highlighting consumer satisfaction, while Leslie responds by screening a 30-year-old Sweetums film which discusses how corn syrup and other snack bar ingredients make cattle unhealthy. At the end of Leslie's screening, Sweetums brings in its commercial's primary actor, the company's CEO Nick Newport Jr. (Gary Weeks) and his son and daughter, Denver and Dakota. Denver instructs the forum audience members to look under their seats for candy. The forum audience exclaims <b>with</b> <b>excitement</b> and ultimately votes in favor of the sponsorship deal. Ron taunts Leslie by eating two unhealthful servings of steak ("turf and turf"), but she remains genuinely concerned for his health. Ron later apologizes to Leslie for having [...] "been a horse's ass".|$|E
500|$|McNeile's {{war stories}} were seen by reviewers as honest portrayals of the war, with British and American reviewers in the {{mainstream}} press praising his realism and avoidance of sentimentality in dealing with his subject matter. Reviewing Men, Women, and Guns for The Times Literary Supplement, Francis Henry Gribble wrote that [...] "Sapper {{has been successful in}} previous volumes of war stories... When the time comes for picking out the writers whose war fiction has permanent value, his claim {{to be included in the}} list will call for serious examination." [...] The reviewer of Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E. for The Atlanta Constitution reminded its readers that McNeile [...] "has been called the foremost literary genius of the British army." [...] Jaillant observes that once McNeile moved from war stories to thrillers, with the concurrent re-positioning of advertising and marketing by Hodder & Stoughton, the reviewers also treated him differently, and presented him as [...] "a writer of thrillers, without any pretension to literary seriousness". When reviewing Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back for The New York Times, the critic observed that [...] "if you like a good knock-down-and-drag-out yarn <b>with</b> <b>excitement</b> and violence on nearly every page, you can't go wrong on Bulldog Drummond"; for the novel Bulldog Drummond at Bay, the reviewer considered that [...] "as a piece of fictional melodrama, the book is first rate".

500|$|On {{the evening}} of 29 May the theatre was packed. Gustav Linor reported, [...] "Never... has the hall been so full, or so resplendent; the {{stairways}} and the corridors were crowded with spectators eager to see and to hear". The evening began with Les Sylphides, in which Nijinsky and Karsavina danced the main roles. The Rite followed. Some eyewitnesses and commentators said that the disturbances in the audience began during the Introduction, and grew in a crescendo when the curtain rose on the stamping dancers in [...] "Augurs of Spring". But music historian Richard Taruskin asserts, [...] "it was not Stravinsky's music that did the shocking. It was the ugly earthbound lurching and stomping devised by Vaslav Nijinsky." [...] Marie Rambert, who was working {{as an assistant to}} Nijinsky, recalled later that it was soon impossible to hear the music on the stage. In his autobiography, Stravinsky writes that the derisive laughter that greeted the first bars of the Introduction disgusted him, and that he left the auditorium to watch the rest of the performance from the stage wings. The demonstrations, he says, grew into [...] "a terrific uproar" [...] which, along with the on-stage noises, drowned out the voice of Nijinsky who was shouting the step numbers to the dancers. The journalist and photographer Carl Van Vechten recorded that the person behind him got carried away <b>with</b> <b>excitement,</b> and [...] "began to beat rhythmically on top of my head", though Van Vechten failed to notice this at first, his own emotion being so great.|$|E

500|$|In a September 3, 2000 1211 {{win over}} the Baltimore Orioles, Lofton tied a MLB record {{previously}} held by Red Rolfe when he scored in [...] 18 consecutive games. The winning margin was provided by Lofton's 13th-inning home run and in the game he tied an Indians' franchise single-game record with five stolen bases. He finished the 2000 season batting [...]278, recording 30 stolen bases and 107 runs (the sixth time crossing home plate 100 times or more in nine seasons). The Indians finished the regular season 9072 and one game out of the wild card. After missing the post-season in 2000, the Indians returned in 2001 after winning the AL Central with a 9171 regular season record. Before winning the division, however, Lofton scored the game-winning run during an August 5 game against the Seattle Mariners;the Indians were down by 12 runs, and became just the third team in MLB history to overcome such a deficit, winning 1514 in 11 innings. Indians catcher Eddie Taubensee, {{who was involved in}} the trade which sent Lofton from Houston to Cleveland {{at the beginning of his}} major league career, caught Lofton after he slid into home plate and jumped <b>with</b> <b>excitement</b> after discovering he had just scored the game-winning run. [...] "I caught him and wasn't going to let him go", Taubensee said. Cleveland won that game against Seattle but lost their match-up with the 116-win Mariners in the 2001 ALDS. He hit 66 RBIs on the regular season (second-most in his career) but failed to record 20 stolen bases for the first time in his major league career and batted a career-low [...]261. Lofton had been treated for a rib cage problem that had impacted his play before the All-Star break. His second stint with Cleveland lasted through 2001 in which his salary was for $8 million in his final contract year with the club. He became a free agent following the conclusion of the season.|$|E

2500|$|Spencer read <b>with</b> <b>excitement</b> the {{original}} positivist sociology of Auguste Comte. A philosopher of science, Comte had proposed {{a theory of}} sociocultural evolution that society progresses by a general law of three stages. Writing after various developments in biology, however, Spencer rejected what he regarded as the ideological aspects of Comte's positivism, attempting to reformulate social science {{in terms of his}} principle of evolution, which he applied to the biological, psychological and sociological aspects of the universe. Given the primacy with which Spencer placed on evolution in his work, Spencer's sociology might be described as socially Darwinistic (though strictly speaking he was a proponent of Lamarckism rather than Darwinism). [...] Despite the popularity of this view, such a description of Spencer's sociology is mistaken. [...] While Spencer's political and ethical writings had themes consistent with social Darwinism, such themes are not present in Spencer's sociological works, which focus on building a theory regarding how processes of societal growth and differentiation lead to changing amounts of complexity amongst the various forms of social organization ...|$|E
