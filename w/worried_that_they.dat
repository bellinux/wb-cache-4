5|$|After the {{communist}} revolution in Afghanistan in 1978, authoritarian actions forced upon the populace by the Communist regime {{led to the}} Afghan civil war, with the mujahideen leading the popular backlash against the regime. The Soviet Union was <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were losing their influence in Central Asia, so after a KGB report claimed that Afghanistan could be taken {{in a matter of}} weeks, Brezhnev and several top party officials agreed to a full intervention in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of such initiatives, Romania {{tended to}} give little {{attention}} to the potential of recruitment in Russia, as many decision-makers were still uncertain about the devotion of Transylvanians and Bukovinans, and <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might be welcoming Austro-Hungarian spies into army ranks. Additionally, probably half of the 120,000 men excluded themselves from the pool of recruits, as Austrian loyalists, invalids or men who had reason to fear Austria-Hungary's retaliation. Support from within Romania was therefore weak, and Russian obstruction still had a part to play, but in January the camp was visited by Lieutenant Colonel Constantin Gh. Pietraru of the Romanian Land Forces, on a mission to evaluate the recruitment project. The reversal of fortunes on the Romanian front had brought a Central Powers' invasion into southern Romania, and the Romanian military authority became pressured into finding new soldiers for the defensive action.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{defenders}} ran out {{of water}} on May 8 (according to a report later submitted by Madero himself) and were confined to only a few buildings {{in the center of}} the city. Most of the fighting at this point was at close quarters; as a result, the advantage in machine guns and artillery that the federals enjoyed earlier was no longer a factor. According to some accounts, Gen. Navarro's troops were on the verge of mutiny and he was <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would turn on his officers. To forestall that possibility, Navarro began negotiations with the rebel forces. He surrendered the town two days later, at 2:30p.m. on May 10, 1911.|$|E

They swam to Nicosian and {{attempted}} to join the six-man boarding party by climbing up her hanging lifeboat falls and pilot ladder. Herbert, <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might try to scuttle the steamer, ordered his men to open fire with small arms, killing all in the water. Wegener is described by some accounts as being shot while trying to swim to the Baralong.|$|E
25|$|Coleridge at {{this time}} envisioned the {{community}} including “twelve men with their families,” among whom the costs would be split, with the wealthier {{members of the community}} making up for the shortcomings of the poorer members. Besides money, other practical issues arose. Having little ability in farming or carpentry, the young men planned to acquire these skills over the winter in time for a March departure. Among the families who were planning to make the voyage were children, and Coleridge <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might already be deeply prejudiced by society, which could subvert and corrupt the Pantisocracy.|$|E
25|$|As {{the end of}} the war neared, {{the prisoners}} began to worry about their future {{position}} in Japanese society. A Press article stated that to their own people they were considered dead. In September 1944 the prisoners told a neutral inspector that provision needed to be made for them to return as honourable citizens, or that they be given asylum on a Pacific island. They said if something could not be done mass suicide might result. After {{the end of the}} war they also <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could be attacked in New Zealand over the conditions of Japanese prisoner of war camps.|$|E

25|$|In 200 CE, the Battle of Guandu {{broke out}} between Cao Cao and his rival, Yuan Shao, whose {{hometown}} was in Runan Commandery (汝南郡; covering parts of present-day southeastern Henan and northwestern Anhui). Although Yuan Shao {{was not in}} Runan Commandery, he maintained some influence there through his retainers, who led small groups of armed men and had strongholds scattered throughout the commandery. Cao Cao was <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would {{pose a threat to}} his base in Xu County while he was away at the frontline at Guandu, so he appointed Man Chong as the Administrator (太守) of Runan Commandery to deal with Yuan Shao's retainers.|$|E
25|$|In their article, Sherman and her coauthors {{explain that}} in the past, most of {{the gay and lesbian}} {{veterans}} were uncomfortable in disclosing their sexual orientations or identities because they were afraid that this information could lead to their discharge from the military. With the repeal of the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy, gays and lesbians are assured that their sexual orientations will not be used against them. Nonetheless, because of their previous experiences in the military, many gay and lesbian veterans are still worried that this information may jeopardize their future careers and prospects. Because of societal stereotypes and stigmas, they are also <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may be denied medical service, lose their benefits, or receive inferior services.|$|E
25|$|The man {{disguised}} as a woman, {{now known as the}} rank of Naishi no Kami (head of the ceremonies committee), becomes the sheltered princess's confidante, whereas the woman {{disguised as}} a man becomes a Chūnagon (mid-ranking courtier). The siblings are <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will be exposed, and so Naishi no Kami is even shyer than most ladies of the court, and the Chūnagon more aloof than is seemly. Despite this, the Chūnagon has platonic affairs with the elder Yoshino princess and the Lady of the Reikeiden. Naishi no Kami is pursued by men — the Crown Prince falls in love with Naishi no Kami based on her reputation, and pursuing her relentlessly. The Chūnagon's best friend, Saishō Chūjō, attempts to seduce Naishi no Kami for a period of two nights and a day.|$|E

25|$|In 263, the Wei {{imperial}} {{court ordered}} Zhong Hui, Deng Ai and Zhuge Xu to lead separate armies to attack and conquer Wei's rival state, Shu Han. During {{and after the}} campaign against Shu, Zhong Hui framed Zhuge Xu and Deng Ai for cowardice and treason respectively, and seized command of their troops. By the time Shu surrendered to Wei in 263, Zhong Hui was in full control of all the Wei military forces in Shu territory. In 264, with backing from Jiang Wei, a former Shu general, Zhong Hui started a rebellion against Sima Zhao. However, the revolt failed when Zhong Hui's plan to purge several Wei officers – because he was <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would not support him – was leaked out. The officers escaped from custody, regrouped with their men, mutinied against Zhong Hui, and killed him and Jiang Wei.|$|E
25|$|According to the Book of Exodus, Moses {{was born}} in a time when his people, the Israelites, an enslaved minority, were {{increasing}} in numbers and the Egyptian Pharaoh was <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might ally themselves with Egypt's enemies. Moses' Hebrew mother, Jochebed, secretly hid him when the Pharaoh ordered all newborn Hebrew boys to be killed {{in order to reduce the}} population of the Israelites. Through the Pharaoh's daughter (identified as Queen Bithia in the Midrash), the child was adopted as a foundling from the Nile river and grew up with the Egyptian royal family. After killing an Egyptian slavemaster (because the slavemaster was smiting a Hebrew), Moses fled across the Red Sea to Midian, where he encountered The Angel of the Lord, speaking to him from within a burning bush on Mount Horeb (which he regarded as the Mountain of God).|$|E
25|$|The {{new owners}} {{concluded}} that the airport needed a new control tower and a new terminal building. Construction was issued as a public tender in 1987, but the military decided to stop the plans. At this time, a debate about a new location for Oslo Airport had started. One of the proposals was to use Gardermoen, {{one of the two}} permanently used air stations in Eastern Norway. The air force was <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would have to abandon Gardermoen and relocate to Torp. It would be likely that this would give twenty or forty fighter jets stationed at Torp. The military expansion plans were not in line with the civilian ones. At the same time, the military felt that the existing terminal building was located too close to the arsenal, and that a new terminal had to relocate further away. The airport operators needed additional space. The old terminal had a capacity of 10,000 passengers; in 1984, it served 42,486, and in 1987, 100,907 passengers. By 1990, the issues related to Gardermoen had been resolved, and the military no longer had objections to expanding Torp.|$|E

25|$|The Journal {{claims to}} have sent the first news report, on the Dow Jones wire, of a plane {{crashing}} into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged {{by the collapse of}} the World Trade Center just across the street. Top editors <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might miss publishing the first issue {{for the first time in}} the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick, N.J., corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor (and current Washington bureau chief) John Bussey, who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the Journal offices and filling them with dust and debris. The Journal won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories.|$|E

Michael Metevier of PopMatters found the lyrics to be [...] "some of the most affecting and least clumsy" [...] of the band's career, though he <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might strike some Wilco fans as dull. Rob Sheffield said {{that while he was}} unimpressed with the lyrics of other Wilco albums, he liked the songwriting on Sky Blue Sky. However, Brandon Kreitler of Dusted Magazine felt that the lyrics seem like an insular Tweedy confessional, and Doug Freeman of The Austin Chronicle described the collaborative songwriting as yielding [...] "fatalistic ambivalence" [...] while giving the album two stars out of five.|$|E

Al-Kateb said of his situation, [...] "We [...] just walking in a big detention.
