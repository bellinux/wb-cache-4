40|$|<b>Waste</b> <b>boiler</b> ash was {{successfully}} utilised as {{catalyst for the}} direct synthesis of glycerol carbonate from glycerol and urea. A series of catalysts were prepared using various calcination temperatures. The physico-chemical properties of the catalysts have been investigated by using XRD, BET, TGA, FESEMEDX, ICP-MS, Hammett test and CO 2 -TPD. From the study {{it was found that}} boiler ash had significant catalytic activity towards conversion of glycerol into glycerol carbonate. It is believed that the potassium metal ion which detaches from potassium silicate had a major impact on the catalytic data where the potassium ion being a weak Lewis acid causes selective catalytic transformation of glycerol into glycerol carbonate. The mechanistic pathway through glycerol carbamate intermediate was confirmed through time online analysis study using 13 C-NMR and ATR-FTIR, respectively. However, the selective transformation of glycerol carbamate into glycerol carbonate is reported to be different where it is formed in an accelerated manner.

40|$|This {{research}} incorporates <b>waste</b> <b>boiler</b> ash into masonry {{construction materials}} using alkali-activation. The boiler ash, derived {{from three different}} Indian pulp and paper mills, has many undesirable characteristics for alkali-activation, including varying shape, large particle sizes ranging from 5 to 600 μm, loss on ignition between 8 and 35 %, and less than 4 % alumina. When combined with supplementary materials {{in the form of}} clay and lime, high compressive strengths are observed in the bricks made with all three ashes, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed mix design. A brick formulation with a solids phase weight ratio of ash(70) :clay(20) :lime(10), liquid to solid ratio of 0. 45, and 2 M NaOH produces bricks with compressive strengths between 11 and 15 MPa after 28 days curing at 30 °C. Furthermore, early strength development is observed, as more than 55 % of the 28 day strength is achieved after one day curing. An economic and environmental analysis indicates that these bricks can be produced for similar costs as the clay fired brick with reduced environmental impact, making them a viable alternative in the market...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the years}} {{production}} of glycerol as a crude waste from biodiesel making industries {{has been largely}} increasing. This is because for every 100 kg of biodiesel produced 10 kg of glycerol is produced as a by-product which corresponds to 10 weight percentage of biodiesel. It is estimated {{that by the year}} 2016, the production of crude glycerol will reach 4 billion gallons (Rahmat et al. 2010). Therefore, the market value of glycerol has dropped drastically over the recent years. To overcome this problem, the conversion of glycerol into valuable chemicals such as glycerol carbonate through an economical catalytic synthesis route is suggested herein. Glycerol carbonate has myriad uses where they play a major role as a component of surfactants, paints, coatings, gas-separation membranes, electrolytes liquid carrier and cosmetics (Aresta et al., 2009; Sonati et al., 2013). However the challenge does not only lie in the conversion but also focuses on usage of waste materials as the feedstock and as the catalysts. Malaysia is the second largest oil palm producer in the world and about 4 million tonnes of boiler ash is produced as waste from incineration of palm fruits, palm kernel, palm shells and palm fibers (Mohammed et al. 2005). Hence, the <b>waste</b> <b>boiler</b> ash (BA) was used as catalyst in this research. For that, a series of catalysts were prepared using various calcination temperatures. The reactions were conducted in triplicates and time online analysis (TOL) was conducted up to 10 hours (Figure 1) to determine optimum reaction time for production of glycerol. Lower yield observed at reaction time more than 4 hours is due to the decomposition of glycerol carbonate. Besides, the catalysts were characterized using XRD, TGA, ICP-MS, FESEM, FTIR, NH 3 -TPD, CO-TPD and Hammett test. To add on, the highest catalytic activity obtained resulted in an average of 93...|$|E
40|$|The waste-heat boiler is used {{within the}} Sulphide flash {{smelting}} process {{as the main}} dust and energy recovery unit. The large volume of off-gas discharged from the flash smelter is {{at a very high}} temperature (1350 °C) and contains a significant dust load that subjects the downstream waste-heat boiler to tough and demanding conditions. The boiler cavity is especially prone to dust accretions, fouling, and corrosion caused by accumulation of molten particles and precipitation of sulphuric acid. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is applied within a qualitative study to model the flow and heat transfer distribution throughout the waste-heat boiler. The commercial CFD package, Fluent 6. 2. 16, was applied to a modified waste-heat boiler (23 m × 11 m × 5. 4 m) within the Outokumpu flash smelting process. This investigation focuses on the geometric modifications to the typical boiler design, which includes elevation of the ceiling, placement of flow-obstructing baffles and radiation plates parallel within the flow path. Also investigated were various boiler operating conditions such as the circulation of process off-gas, air leakage from the dust discharging hoppers and variation in inlet gas composition. The geometric modifications had the desired effect of increasing the volumetric utilization and therefore enhancing heat transfer between the boiler surface and the gas stream and dust segregation. Introducing circulated off-gas at a rate of 20 m/s and at a 45 ° angle {{to the front of the}} <b>waste</b> <b>boiler</b> further enhanced cooling while reducing the high impact of the furnace-uptake gas-stream on the boiler ceiling. The placement of radiation plates was found to be very effective in enhancing the heat transfer surface and distributing gas flow within the boiler.

40|$|This {{project has}} been {{executed}} as an assignment by Sundsvall Energi AB {{with the purpose of}} increasing the efficiency of the flue gas condenser by cooling the incoming district heating return before the flue gas condensing exchanger. The flue gas condenser is part of the heat production. The first production unit is the <b>waste</b> <b>boiler</b> where the steam can be distributed between production of electricity and heat production, depending on how large the costumers needs of electricity and heat are. When the customers’ needs are less than Korstaverkets maximum production, an addition of heat from the flue gas condenser means that a larger portion of the steam can go to the turbine and increase the production of electricity. When the customer’s needs are larger than Korstaverkets maximum capacity, a contribution from the flue gas condenser means that Korstaverket can purchase less heat from SCA (Ostrand and Ortviken). The benefit of cooling the district heating return is that more heat and electricity can be produced. In {{the early stages of the}} project, literature and the Internet were used to get a basic understanding of the assignment. The supervisor and the staff at Korsta have given drawings and data of the power plant process, and also given advice regarding the process. Product data sheets from suppliers have been used for doing calculations and for getting information about the construction. Scientific articles and literature were used to get facts and formulas. The study has shown that the additional cooling of the district heating return has contributed to an increased efficiency of the flue gas condenser, from 0. 9 % with an average flow of the deionized water to 17. 2 % with a maximum flow of the deionized water.   The exam work has shown how complicated an energy system can be. The process can be more complicated then what the drawings show, because a profitable solution in one part of the process can lead to deterioration in another part of the process. The calculations show that the major factor that’s influencing the cooling is the deionized waters flow into the new heat exchanger. The repayment period can get short. High flows generate a profit after only a couple of months, while low flows of 1 liter/second take up to 3. 5 years with KE Therms brazed heat exchangers and 2. 5 years with Tranters gasketed heat exchangers. ...|$|E
