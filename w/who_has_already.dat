500|$|Thus, from {{fewer than}} twenty basic techniques, there are {{thousands}} of possible implementations.

Specific aikido kata are typically referred to with the formula [...] "attack-technique(-modifier)". For instance, katate-dori ikkyō refers to any ikkyō technique executed when uke is holding one wrist. This could be further specified as katate-dori ikkyō omote, referring to any forward-moving ikkyō technique from that grab.|$|E
