5000|$|The field {{windings}} are supplied with {{power from the}} battery via the ignition switch and regulator. A parallel circuit supplies the [...] "charge" [...] <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> and is earthed via the regulator (which is why the indicator is on when the ignition is on but the engine is not running). Once the engine is running and the alternator is generating power, a diode feeds the field current from the alternator main output equalizing the voltage across the <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> which goes off. The wire supplying the field current {{is often referred to}} as the [...] "exciter" [...] wire. The drawback of this arrangement is that if the warning lamp burns out or the [...] "exciter" [...] wire is disconnected, no current reaches the {{field windings}} and the alternator will not generate power. Some <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> circuits are equipped with a resistor in parallel with the lamp that permit excitation current to flow if the warning lamp burns out. The driver should check that the <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> is on when the engine is stopped; otherwise, there might not be any indication of a failure of the belt which may also drive the cooling water pump. Some alternators will self-excite when the engine reaches a certain speed.|$|E

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{critical}} {{review of the literature}} on early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> of economics crises and propose methods to overcome several pitfalls of the previous contributions. We use a quarterly panel of 40 EU and OECD countries for the period 1970 – 2010. As the response variable, we construct a continuous index of crisis incidence capturing the real costs for the economy. As the potential <b>warning</b> <b>indicators,</b> we evaluate a wide range of variables, selected according to the previous literature and our own considerations. For each potential indicator we determine the optimal lead employing panel vector autoregression, then we select useful indicators employing Bayesian model averaging. We re-estimate the resulting specification by system GMM to account for potential endogeneity of some indicators. Subsequently, to allow for country heterogeneity, we evaluate the random coefficients estimator and illustrate the stability among endogenous clusters. Our results suggest that global variables rank among the most useful early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators.</b> In addition, housing prices emerge consistently as an important domestic source of risk.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of developing early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> based on incident investigation. The use of early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> may contribute to ensure that oil companies produce oil and gas without harmful spills. The incident investigated was a hydraulic oil leak from the Eirik Raude drilling rig during exploration drilling in the Barents Sea in April 2005. The incident is analyzed using influence diagrams, from which seven general barriers against hydraulic leaks have been identified. For each barrier both checkpoints and indicators have been developed, which provide information {{about the status of}} the barriers and early warning of potential spills. The work described in this paper has shown {{that it is possible to}} develop early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> based on incident investigation. Several of the proposed checkpoints/indicators may have prevented the oil leak at Eirik Raude, if they had been in use prior to the incident...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Exploration and {{production}} {{of oil and gas}} in certain sensitive areas such as the Barents Sea and Lofoten, is controversial and further expansion depends on the ability to avoid harmful spills. One way of improving the ability to avoid such spills is to use early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators.</b> The objective of the work presented in this paper is to describe and compare strengths and weaknesses of different approaches for the development of early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators.</b> The approaches that have been compared are: safety performance-based methods; risk-based methods; incident-based methods; and resilience-based methods. There are pros and cons with all methods. All methods are very favorable with respect to some characteristics {{and at the same time}} very unfavorable to some other characteristics. They are also different in terms of scope and depth of analysis. This suggests that we should be flexible with respect to the choice of methods, and preferably use more than one method. Thus, the main conclusion is that it is favorable to have the possibility to use several different methods for the establishment of early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{and provides}} empirical tests of early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> of banking and currency crises in emerging economies. The {{aim is to}} identify key empirical regularities {{in the run-up to}} banking and currency crises that would enable officials and private market participants to recognize vulnerability to financial crises at an earlier stage. This, in turn, should make it easier to motivate the corrective policy actions that would prevent such crises from actually taking place. Interest in identifying early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> of financial crises has soared of late, stoked primarily by two factors. First, there is increasing recognition that banking and currency crises can be extremely costly to the countries in which they originate; in addition, these crises often spillover via a variety of international channels to increase the vulnerability of other countries to financial crisis. The second reason for the increased interest in early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> of financial crises is that there is accumulating evidence that two of the most closely watched “market indicators” of default and currency risks [...] namely, interest rate spreads and changes in credit ratings [...] frequently do not provide much advance warning of currency and banking crises. ...|$|R
