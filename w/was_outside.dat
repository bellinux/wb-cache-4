Only the maximum value <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> of the ideal range. The creek was found to be slightly alkaline, with a pH ranging from 6.82 to 8.07. The average pH of the creek was 7.60 and only the maximum value <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> of the ideal range. The concentration of total dissolved solids ranged from 50.00 to 490.00 milligrams per liter, with an average of 167.81 milligrams per liter. Only the maximum value <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> of the ideal range.|$|E
5|$|Juventus {{finished}} the 1984–85 Serie A in fifth position, which <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> of the European qualification positions. In order {{to participate in}} European competition in 1985–86, they needed to win the European Cup. Liverpool had finished second behind Everton in the 1984–85 Football League, and thus qualified for the UEFA Cup, but victory in the final {{would enable them to}} compete in the European Cup the following season.|$|E
5|$|NESCo {{also argued}} that they had chosen the site to protect the city's amenities, in that it <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> the city boundary, {{partially}} surrounded by higher ground, and {{in the lee of}} prevailing winds. They also said that much could be done architecturally to fit the station into its surroundings.|$|E
60|$|It {{certainly}} is queer {{what a difference}} there is between being inside and <b>outside.</b> Sometimes happiness <b>is</b> inside and sometimes it <b>is</b> <b>outside.</b> Sometimes {{the one who is}} inside wishes with all his might that he <b>were</b> <b>outside,</b> and sometimes the one who <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> would give anything in the world to be inside.|$|R

5000|$|In 2010, 58% of births <b>were</b> <b>outside</b> {{marriage}} in Wales. Currently, Wales and Scotland {{are the only}} countries of the United Kingdom {{where the majority of}} births <b>are</b> <b>outside</b> of marriage (51.3% of births in Scotland in 2012 <b>were</b> <b>outside</b> of marriage [...] ). Wales (along with Scotland) also had the highest death rate (10.9 per thousand) in 2005.|$|R
5|$|On April17, a weak low exited {{from the}} coast of South Africa and moved southeastward over the warm waters of the {{southern}} Mozambique Channel. By April19, it had organized into a subtropical depression and produced gale force winds. The MFR did not classify the system, however, due to it being located from 3335°S, which <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> of the agency's area of warning responsibility at the time.|$|E
5|$|The council sat in Fort Garry, Manitoba {{even though}} this <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> of the {{boundaries}} of the District of Keewatin. Morris determined during the creation of the territory that the affairs of the District of Keewatin should be administered from Fort Garry until November 7, 1876. A total of six members were appointed to the Council. The law that created the territory allowed for a minimum of five members.|$|E
5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting that using age in the custody analysis was not a precedent established by the Supreme Court. The note argued that establishing such broad legal precedent <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> the bounds of {{the authority of the}} Ninth Circuit and the Supreme Court was right to reverse. Instead, the note supported the state court who had applied the law as the Supreme Court had in the past.|$|E
50|$|When {{converting}} a modus ponens, if A <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> {{the scope}} of H, {{then it will be}} necessary to apply axiom 1, A→(H→A), and modus ponens to get H→A. Similarly, if A→S <b>is</b> <b>outside</b> {{the scope of}} H, apply axiom 1, (A→S)→(H→(A→S)), and modus ponens to get H→(A→S). It should not be necessary to do both of these, unless the modus ponens step is the conclusion, because if both <b>are</b> <b>outside</b> the scope, then the modus ponens should have been moved up before H and thus <b>be</b> <b>outside</b> the scope also.|$|R

5|$|After {{all the men}} {{had left}} ringside, {{it was time for}} the WWF Women's Championship match between Wendi Richter, managed by singer Cyndi Lauper (with her manager David Wolfe), and Leilani Kai, managed by former {{champion}} The Fabulous Moolah. Shortly after the match began, Moolah grabbed Richter as she <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> on the floor, but Lauper saved her from an attack. Kai then performed a flying crossbody from the top rope, but Richter used Kai's momentum to roll-up Kai in a pinning position. With this pin, Richter became the new Women's Champion.|$|E
5|$|All of the game's {{music was}} {{composed}} by Shogo Sakai. Itoi saw Sakai as competing with Mother 2 composer Keiichi Suzuki for his fans. Itoi {{had to choose}} a composer from the development team who understood the series and could work full-time on the project, including other development duties. Thus, he could not choose Suzuki, who <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> the project, or Hirokazu Tanaka, who had become the president of Creatures. Sakai also understood the game's story intimately and named the Magypsies after musical terms. He worked to make the music feel similar to previous entries in the series.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the year, the first Senate meeting always took place at the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. Other venues could include the Temple of Fides or the Temple of Concord, or, if the meeting <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> of the formal boundary of the city, at the Temple of Apollo or (if a war meeting) at the Temple of Bellona. In addition, the Senate operated while under various religious restrictions. For example, before any meeting could begin, a sacrifice to the gods was made, and a search for divine omens (the auspices) was taken. The auspices were taken in order to determine whether that particular Senate meeting held favor with the gods. The Senate was only allowed to meet in a building of religious significance, such as the Curia Hostilia.|$|E

5000|$|Clipping is {{the process}} of {{removing}} primitives that <b>are</b> <b>outside</b> of the view box in order to continue on to the rasterizer stage. Primitives that <b>are</b> <b>outside</b> of the view box are removed or [...] "clipped" [...] away. Once the primitives that <b>are</b> <b>outside</b> of the view box are removed, the primitives that are still inside of the view box will be drawn into new triangles to be proceeded to the next stage.|$|R
5|$|By October 11, {{investigators}} had conducted 124 interviews and had found 174 {{pieces of evidence}} related to the case. They were also investigating the West Nickel Mines School shooting in Pennsylvania, which had occurred {{five days after the}} shooting in Bailey. As a result of the September 27 incident, Platte Canyon High School increased its security, leaving only one school entrance unlocked. It plans to install more security cameras. Park County Sheriff Fred Wegener proposed having a guard there during the school day, but he stated that that particular suggestion <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> the current budget.|$|E
5|$|Doe {{started his}} career with Swindon Town as a youth player before joining Conference Premier club Weymouth. In February 2009, he left Weymouth due to {{financial}} problems at the club and registered with Kettering Town {{to allow him to}} join Dagenham & Redbridge on loan {{until the end of the}} 2008–09 season. He was refused permission to join Dagenham on a permanent basis by The Football Association as the move <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> the transfer window. Doe has also represented the England C team, making one appearance against Malta under-21s.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th and 13th centuries, law {{was taught}} in the City of London, {{primarily}} by the clergy. During the 13th century, two events happened that destroyed this form of legal education; firstly, a decree by Henry III of England on 2 December 1234 that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London, and secondly a papal bull was issued in 1254 that prohibited the clergy from teaching the common law, rather than canon law. As a result, the existing system of legal education fell apart. The common lawyers migrated to the hamlet of Holborn, the nearest place to the law courts at Westminster Hall that <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> the City.|$|E

5|$|Indiana troops {{participated in}} 308 {{military}} engagements, {{the majority of}} them between the Mississippi River and the Appalachian Mountains. Soldiers from Indiana were present on most of the Civil War battlefields, beginning with the first engagement involving Hoosier troops at the Battle of Philippi (West Virginia) on June 3, 1861, to the Battle of Palmetto Ranch (Texas) on May 13, 1865. Nearly all the fighting <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> of the state's boundaries. Only one significant conflict, known as Morgan's Raid, occurred on Indiana soil during the war. The raid, which caused a brief panic in Indianapolis and southern Indiana, was preceded by two minor incursions into Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, {{the three}} Baltic states, had formed the Baltic Entente in 1934. Its {{principal}} purposes were coordination of joint {{foreign policy and}} mutual international diplomatic support; {{it was not a}} military alliance. In Latvian and Estonian opinion, the Polish–Lithuanian dispute over Vilnius <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> the scope of the Entente, but they wished for a resolution, considering the conflict detrimental to the stability of the region. Latvia attempted to persuade Estonia to exert mutual pressure on Lithuania for a speedy acceptance of the ultimatum. This reaction from an ally was unexpected.|$|E
5|$|Plans were {{formulated}} on 6 September {{to transport}} the British 1st Airborne Division to Taranto from their base in North Africa. They would {{take advantage of the}} Italian surrender to capture the port and establish anti-aircraft defences. What was left of the Italian fleet still using the harbour was expected to have left beforehand. The Allies believed that the division would face only minimal opposition and would be able to overcome any resistance with the limited naval support available, as Taranto <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> the range of Allied fighter aircraft based in Sicily.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Department of Defense {{responded by}} {{accelerating}} its Rapid Deployment Forces concept but suffered from major problems with airlift and sealift capability. In order to slow an enemy invasion of other countries, air power was critical; however the key Iran-Afghanistan border <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> {{the range of}} the U.S. Navy's carrier-based attack aircraft, leaving this role to the U.S. Air Force. Although the B-52 had the range to support on-demand global missions, its long runway requirements limited the forward basing possibilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the violence; flowers, scarves and shirts were laid outside the Elland Road gates in tribute. The statue of former Leeds United captain Billy Bremner which <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> the stadium also had a black armband placed on it {{as a symbol of}} the club mourning. Leeds United {{installed}} a brass plaque in Elland Road to remember those who had been killed in the violence. Leeds' Premier League match against Arsenal the Sunday before the second leg was marked by Arsenal players laying flowers at all four corners of Elland Road and a minute's silence being held before the match started in respect for the death of the two Leeds fans.|$|E
5|$|The sole female Togolese athlete at the 2004 Games, Sandrine Thiébaud-Kangni, {{competed in}} the 400 metres.

This was only ahead of Sri Lanka's Damayanthi Dharsha (54.58 seconds), but <b>was</b> <b>outside</b> the time of Mireille Nguimgo from Cameroon (51.90 seconds), who was the slowest qualifier from the heat. Thiébaud-Kangni did not progress to the following round.|$|E
