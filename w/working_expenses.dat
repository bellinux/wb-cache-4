2500|$|The zamindari {{system was}} one of two {{principal}} revenue settlements undertaken by the Company in India. In southern India, Thomas Munro, who would later become Governor of Madras, promoted the ryotwari system or the Munro system, in which the government settled land-revenue directly with the peasant farmers, or ryots. It was first tried in small scale by Captain Alexander Read in the areas that were taken over from the wars with Tipu Sultan. Subsequently, developed by Thomas Munro, this system was gradually extended all over South India. This was, in part, a consequence of the turmoil of the Anglo-Mysore Wars, which had prevented the emergence of a class of large landowners; in addition, Munro and others felt that ryotwari was closer to traditional practice in the region and ideologically more progressive, allowing the benefits of Company rule to reach the lowest levels of rural society. At the heart of the ryotwari system was a particular theory of economic rent—and based on David Ricardo's Law of Rent—promoted by utilitarian James Mill who formulated the Indian revenue policy between 1819 and 1830. [...] "He believed that the government was the ultimate lord of the soil and should not renounce its right to 'rent', i.e. the profit left over on richer soil when wages and other <b>working</b> <b>expenses</b> had been settled." [...] Another keystone of the new system of temporary settlements was the classification of agricultural fields according to soil type and produce, with average rent rates fixed for the period of the settlement. According to Mill, taxation of land rent would promote efficient agriculture and simultaneously prevent the emergence of a [...] "parasitic landlord class." [...] Mill advocated ryotwari settlements which consisted of government measurement and assessment of each plot (valid for 20 or 30 years) and subsequent taxation which was dependent on the fertility of the soil. The taxed amount was nine-tenths of the [...] "rent" [...] in the early 19th century and gradually fell afterwards. However, in spite of the appeal of the ryotwari system's abstract principles, class hierarchies in southern Indian villages had not entirely disappeared—for example village headmen continued to hold sway—and peasant cultivators sometimes came to experience revenue demands they could not meet. In the 1850s, a scandal erupted when it was discovered that some Indian revenue agents of the Company were using torture to meet the Company's revenue demands.|$|E
2500|$|The {{question}} is often asked, how {{the cab and}} omnibus proprietors take to these innovations. Of course not very kindly, but experience shows that these individuals are more frightened than hurt. At first {{there is a little}} loss of revenue to the cabmen, but in the end the result is no worse, as people get educated to riding everywhere, and cabs get a fair share. The railways were said to have struck a death-blow at the ordinary vehicle traffic, but such did not prove to be true, and, wherever tramways have opened there has been no decrease in the numbers of cabs - Leicester for instance. Since the company have been running per timetable, the bus proprietors {{have done the same thing}} along St. Ann's Well-road, and with good result. For the comfort of the shareholders of the company, it may be stated that the directors will no doubt pay in July (with the interim dividend paid in February), a dividend at the rate of six per cent per annum. When this is taken into full consideration - that is to say, when all the difficulties are duly allowed for, and it is remembered that only a portion of the line is as yet opened - the result is most satisfactory. Indeed all the shares are now quoted at two per cent premium with few vendors. As to the character of the company, I think it is not undue flattery to say that it is efficiently and economically managed as the staff is limited to the mere necessary officials, and the directorate is small. Considering the rail employed is one that is sure to result in great saving to the shareholders, seeing that there will be little or no cost of repairs, and taking into consideration also the fact that the tramway route is populous, and the <b>working</b> <b>expenses</b> small, there is every reason to prophecy success to the company [...] [...] [...] As far as we can make out the estimated weekly receipts of the Tramway Company amount to about £350, and in Whit week we believe as much as £430 was taken, for which upwards of 50,000 people were carried. Taking £350 as the average weekly receipts gives a total of over £17,000 in a year, which is a very large sum indeed for the present branch of tramway service in a town of such proportions as Nottingham [...] [...] [...] There are 212 cabs in the town, so that estimating the earnings at but £2 per week there is a total of £424 weekly, or £20,000 a year. Taking the above as a very moderate estimate, and making a little allowance for omnibuses, 'carriers' carts, , it is fair to suppose that at least £40,000 a year is spent in Nottingham for passenger traffic.|$|E

The regional structure of preparedness for the receipts is nothing but the regional structure of construction industries, because it is construction industries which take the orders of public works construction from local self-governing bodies. The regional structure of construction industries is a new and good theme on researching for economic geographers. The Writer has investigated money flow from public construction investment to constructors through the regional structure of construction industries in comparision with Nara and Wakayama prefectures. Though total number of construction establishments is larger in Wakayama prefecture than in Nara prefecture, both {{of them have a}} strong resemblance in the constitution by scale and the regional distribution. The scale of construction establishments is very small and their locations spread from the urban to the rural district.

In the annual report for the year 1882, Norman stated. “Although we are unable to show any great {{improvement}} in the financial conditions, the school is at present in a more prosperous state that it has been for some time.” The directors then made a bold decision; they reduced the fees to a level that brought them into the reach of a much larger catchment class. By the end of that year there were 27 pupils; by February 35; {{and by the end of}} the summer term 43. In 1882 the school examiner stated: “The high average of last year has been fully maintained in most papers, and in many instances exceeded.” The pupils underwent examinations in English Grammar, History, Geography, Latin, French, Arithmetic, Chemistry, Geology and Agriculture. The credit was down to Taylor, “who employed a mixture of skilful patients and prudent teaching methods.” Although the intellectual state of the school was highly satisfactory the balance sheet for the year 1884, highlighted <b>working</b> <b>expense's</b> £115 in excess of receipts, which the directors cleared at their own expense. In 1887, the directors welcomed female scholars and although William Lawson offered to sponsor two girls there is no evidence to support female attendance. Although the institution had become an academic success it remained financially unviable. The situation further deteriorated after Taylor accepted a position of head teacher at a new college at Tamworth and took the majority of the students with him.|$|R

In present situation to achieve high production and productivity of HEMMs in opencast mines, it is desired to have high % availability and % utilization of equipment besides ensure overall equipment effectiveness as per CMPDI norms/global bench marks. OEE shows that how an equipment is utilized with its maximum effectiveness. It uses parameters like availability, performance and utilization for the estimation of equipment effectiveness. One method for effectively use of equipment in haul cycle is queuing theory. Queuing theory was developed to model systems that provide service for randomly arising demands and predict the behaviour of such systems. A queuing system is one in which customers arrive for service, wait for service if it is not immediately available, and {{move on to the next}} server or exit the system once they have been serviced. Most mining haul routes consist of four main components: loading, loaded hauling, dumping, and unloaded hauling to return to the loader. These components can be modelled together as servers in one cyclic queuing network, or independently as individual service channels. Data from a large open pit mine are analysed and applied to a multichannel queuing model representative of the loading process of the haul cycle. The outputs of the model are compared against the actual dumper data to evaluate the validity of the queuing model developed...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the structural}} {{causes of the}} recent Turkish inflationary episode. It is argued that monetary policies based on credit tightening alone {{are not likely to}} yield the desired target of price stabilisation. Instead, it is hypothesised that the underlying sources of price inflation are affected by income inequality and conflicting claims on national output; and that excessive credit expansion serves mainly to accommodate the inertial inflation thereby originated in the real sector. Given this hypothesis, the paper employs a computable general equilibrium model to investigate four distinct sources of structural inflation for the Turkish economy: (i) the profit/rent inflation based on monopolistic mark-ups over prime costs; (ii) imported inflation due to the import-dependent structure of the domestic industry; (iii) cost-push and demand inflation due to urban wage claims; and (iv) inflation that results from the fiscal pressures of the government's budget deficits. The general equilibrium model is in the Keynesian tradition in determining the production level by aggregate demand constraints. Furthermore, it accommodates oligopolistic mark-up rules and <b>working</b> capital <b>expenses</b> for price determination, and nominal wage fixity to determine the level of employment. The general equilibrium analysis of the macro economy suggests that, over the analysed period, conflicting claims of various social classes on national output and conflicting rates of intersectoral accumulation warranted by competing producer groups have become important sources of disequilibria in the domestic economy; and that the distributional conflict among socio-economic classes had a direct impact on the formation of price movements. ...|$|R
