5|$|Amidst {{his years}} of studying, Lundgren honed his karate skills by {{training}} hard in the dojo for five years, attaining the rank of 2nd dan black belt in Kyokushin in 1978. He captained the Swedish Kyokushin karate team, and was a formidable challenger at the 1979 World Open Tournament (arranged by the Kyokushin Karate Organization) <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> a green belt. He won the European championships in 1980 and 1981, and a heavyweight tournament in Australia in 1982.

5|$|Frank Fetter {{was born}} in Peru, Indiana to a Quaker family {{during the height of}} the American Civil War. Fetter proved an able student as a youth, as {{demonstrated}} by his acceptance to Indiana University in 1879 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> sixteen years old. At Indiana, he joined the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity. Fetter was on track to graduate with the class of 1883, but left college to run his family's bookstore upon news of his father's declining health. Working in the bookstore offered an opportunity for the young man to acquaint himself with some of the economic ideas that would later prove formative. Chief among the intellectual influences Fetter encountered at this time was Henry George's Progress and Poverty (1879).|$|E

5|$|In Europe, {{deaths from}} {{smallpox}} often changed dynastic succession. The only surviving son of Henry VIII, Edward VI, died from complications shortly after apparently {{recovering from the}} disease, thereby nullifying Henry's efforts to ensure a male successor to the throne (his two immediate successors were both women, who had both had it and survived). Louis XV of France succeeded his great-grandfather Louis XIV {{through a series of}} deaths of smallpox or measles among those earlier in the succession line. He himself died of the disease in 1774. William III lost his mother to the disease <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> ten years old in 1660, and named his uncle Charles as legal guardian: her death from smallpox would indirectly spark a chain of events that would eventually lead to the permanent ousting of the Stuart line from the British throne. William III's wife, Mary II of England, died from smallpox as well.|$|E
5|$|Music is {{important}} to the locals of Cortina, with a guitar found in most houses, and young musicians are often found walking the streets. Every year, from the end of July to early August, Cortina hosts the Dino Ciani Festival and Academy. It is held in honour of the celebrated Italian pianist Dino Ciani (1941–1974) who died <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> 32. The festival attracts young pianists from around the world who are able to benefit from classes with some of the world's leading performers. The Festival of the Bands is another annual musical event featuring brass bands from Italy and beyond during the last week of August. Cortina's own band, parading in traditional costumes, is a central attraction dating back to 1861. Cortina d'Ampezzo hosted the 1953 Miss Italia contest, won by Marcella Mariani. Traditionally, on the eves of the festivals of Ascension, Pentecost, Trinity and St Philip and St James, the youth of the town would climb the hills at sunset and light fires.|$|E
5|$|The co-rule between Eystein, Sigurd and Olaf entailed {{a shared}} kingship, and the kingdom itself was not divided into fixed borders. During {{the early years}} of their reign, Eystein is {{nonetheless}} said to have stayed mostly in Western Norway and Trøndelag, while Sigurd was in Viken. In practice, only Eystein and Sigurd ever ruled as kings, as Olaf was considerably younger and died <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> seventeen years old, and virtually nothing is known about him beyond his name. One of the earliest acts by the kings was passing a retterbot, a special law ordained by the king, which among other things abolished various royal taxes that originated from the Danish rule of Sweyn Knutsson and Ælfgifu (under Cnut the Great) in the early 1030s. The kings became very popular because of this. According to some sources, the main motivation for abolishing the taxes was to gain the support of the population for Sigurd's planned crusade.|$|E

Their father is a criminal who runs a chop shop and forces James into his crew <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> 15. Their father is abusive, but Robert gets a scholarship for film school and moves to California, leaving James in his father's hands. To escape, James steals $50,000 from his father and hides it. Their father sends one of his thugs, Bull, after James.|$|R

5|$|Henry III (1 October 1207– 16 November 1272), {{also known}} as Henry of Winchester, was King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Aquitaine from 1216 until his death. The son of King John and Isabella of Angoulême, Henry assumed the throne <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> nine {{in the middle of}} the First Barons' War. Cardinal Guala {{declared}} the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by William Marshal, defeated the rebels at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the Great Charter of 1225, which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons. His early rule was dominated first by Hubert de Burgh and then Peter des Roches, who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230, the King attempted to reconquer the provinces of France that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, Richard, broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by the Church.|$|E
5|$|More than {{a century}} before {{the events of the}} series begin, Fire Lord Sozin, ruler of the Fire Nation, planned a world war to expand his nation's {{territory}} and influence. He was prevented from carrying out his plans by Avatar Roku, who was born in the Fire Nation. After Roku's death, the Avatar was reincarnated as an Airbender named Aang. As Aang was then only a child, Sozin saw his chance and proceeded with his militant plans. Because of the threat of Sozin's war, Aang learned about his avatar status <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> twelve years old. Afraid of his new responsibilities and of separation from his mentor, Gyatso, he fled his home on his flying bison named Appa. Forced into the ocean by a storm, Aang entered the avatar state and encased them in suspended animation in an iceberg for one hundred years. Sozin, knowing that the avatar's reincarnation cycle mandated that an air nomad was the new avatar, carried out a genocide against the Air Nomads during the passing of a once-a-century comet which increases the Firebenders' power, and continues his world conquest.|$|E
5|$|PFC Guy Gabaldon (1926–2006) went to {{live with}} the parents of his Japanese-American friend at the age of 12. At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, his adoptive family was placed in a relocation camp. Gabaldon joined the Marines <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> 17 years old; he was a Private First Class (PFC) when his unit was engaged in the Battle of Saipan in 1944. Gabaldon, who acted as the Japanese interpreter for the Second Marines, working alone in front of the lines, entered enemy caves, pillboxes, buildings, and jungle brush, frequently in the face of hostile fire, and succeeded in not only obtaining vital military information, but in convincing well over 1,000 enemy soldiers and civilians to surrender. He was nominated for the Medal of Honor, but was awarded the Silver Star instead. His medal was later upgraded to the Navy Cross. He turned in more enemy soldiers than Sergeant Alvin York, who was awarded the Medal of Honor during World War I for having captured 132 enemy German soldiers. Gabaldon's actions on Saipan were later memorialized in the film Hell to Eternity, in which he was portrayed by actor Jeffrey Hunter.|$|E

Contrary to the other major Flemish newspapers like De Standaard/Het Nieuwsblad (with Spike and Suzy) and Het Volk (with Nero), Het Laatste Nieuws had no local, Flemish comic strip but only published Dutch comics by Marten Toonder or Hans G. Kresse, which left an opportunity for Merho.|$|R
