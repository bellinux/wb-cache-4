In a June 2004 interview, actress Megan Mullally, who plays Karen, in regards to Cher's appearance, said: [...] "I wasn't sure about Cher's [...] They flew her in. Like, she was sort of dropped in on a crescent moon, she did the scene, and was, like, airlifted back out. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>her</b> {{she was in her}} full Cher Land drag, so I didn't get to experience her as a person." ...|$|E
500|$|She called Betsey Johnson {{a fashion}} inspiration: [...] " [...] {{is a free}} spirit. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>her</b> the other day, I felt like I knew her for my whole life. She's so warm and {{considerate}} and caring. She's amazingly talented and I've been wearing her clothes forever, so to meet her was like, 'Yay!' [...] bowing down to her; she's dope!" [...] Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: [...] "When I first went to get my hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, {{you have to get}} your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting. Cyndi Lauper's videos – that's what intrigued me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Breakaway" [...] {{was directed by}} Dave Meyers, which was shot in two days from July 10 to July 11, 2004. In the video, the younger version of Clarkson was played by Lindsey Krueger. According to Meyers, working with Clarkson was a pleasant experience because he felt she was good and honest, although he had initial doubts in the beginning. He explained, [...] "I was a little worried, her coming off 'American Idol,' it inherently feels manufactured and I didn't {{know how much of}} it was true artistry. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>her,</b> she really does have a good, solid vibe. It was an honor to bring some of that out of her." [...] Since the song is autobiographical, Clarkson decided to act out most of the lyrics in the video. Meyers also realized that the song was featured in The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement and he struggled {{to find a way to}} address the film-footage in the music video, saying [...] "Since it's a movie tie-in, the idea stems from trying to figure out a new way of addressing the film-footage requirement they put on you, so we came up with the idea of her attending the premiere, which is very much something she will do in real life." ...|$|E

500|$|R {{singer and}} friend Brandy {{said about the}} late singer [...] "She came out before Monica and I did, she was our inspiration. At the time, record {{companies}} {{did not believe in}} kid acts and it was just inspiring to see someone that was winning and winning being themselves. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>her</b> I embraced her, I was so happy to meet her." [...] Rapper Drake said that the singer has had the biggest influence on his career. He also has a tattoo of the singer on his back. Solange Knowles remarked on the tenth anniversary of her death that she idolized Aaliyah and proclaimed that she would never be forgotten. Adam Levine, the lead vocalist of the pop rock group Maroon 5, remembers that listening to [...] "Are You That Somebody?" [...] convinced him to pursue a more soulful sound than that of his then-band Kara's Flowers. Erika Ramirez, associate editor of Billboard.com, said at the time of Aaliyah's career [...] "there weren't many artists using the kind of soft vocals the ways she was using it, and now {{you see a lot of}} artists doing that and finding success," [...] her reasoning for Aaliyah's continued influence on current artists. She argued that Aaliyah's second album One in a Million was [...] "very much ahead of its time, with the bass and electro kind of R sounds that they produced", referring to collaborators Timbaland and Missy Elliott and that the sound, which [...] "really stood out" [...] at its time, was being replicated.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1980s, Bjelland {{moved from}} Portland to Minneapolis, where she formed Babes in Toyland. She met Lori Barbero at a {{barbecue}} {{not long after}} moving to Minneapolis in the mid-1980s, and convinced her to become a drummer– something that Lori became talented at. The pair joined with bassist Michelle Leon, and Babes in Toyland was formed. Bjelland has said she intentionally sought out bandmates who had no instrumental experience: [...] "Lori didn't {{know how to play}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>her.</b> Michelle didn't know how to play. I was self-taught. Hopefully, from being technically inexperienced, you can use your imagination, and play the drums like an instrument instead of just being a beat-keeper. And play the bass like you feel it, from your gut, instead of saying, 'Here's my scales.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, Williams was {{diagnosed}} with autism by Lawrence Bartak, a specialist at Monash Medical Centre and a senior lecturer in psychology at the associated Monash University. Bartak later recalled the [...] " [...] displayed all the main features of autism <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>her,</b> including one she wouldn't have known about... The {{fact that she was}} apparently sociable and interacting with people doesn't mean she didn't have some type of disorder". Bartak helped Williams [...] "begin building bridges instead of walls between worlds". In July 1996, doubts about Williams' condition were aired on Radio National's The Health Report and by The Australian newspaper. The claims of [...] "faking it" [...] were denied by both Williams and Bartak. In February 2005, David Smukler, writing in the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities' journal Mental Retardation, noted that back in the mid-1990s some sceptics had a poorly defined understanding of the autism spectrum: [...] "...autistic people such as Donna Williams and Temple Grandin started to publish first-person accounts that described their lives as autistic people living in an often-inhospitable nonautistic world. Many readers of these early accounts questioned whether or not the authors were really autistic. The assumption underlying such responses is that autism is so incapacitating that Williams or Grandin could not be autistic and still write with such insight and sensitivity. When their books first appeared, autistic authors were characterized either as frauds or exceptions". Smukler concluded: [...] "Today, Williams' and Grandin's 'credentials' are rarely challenged. Rather than being doubted, {{they are more likely to}} be commended for offering us an 'inside out' view of autism".|$|E

"I {{never was}} took aback so {{in all my}} life," [...] said the seaman, sitting down beside the old woman, and drawing a sigh so long {{that it might have}} been likened to a {{moderate}} breeze.

5000|$|The film’s suicide {{scene was}} {{performed}} on the same rock where the real incident occurred, and the role of Justa Quispe was played by her niece, Digna Quispe.Movie director and screenwriter Sebastián Sepúlveda says about his first encounter with Digna Quispe: [...] "I was very afraid of Digna <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>met</b> <b>her.</b> She don't shake hands, she [...] "shake" [...] just the fingers, and in a very cold way", later she would accept to take part of the project. Digna's harsh personality was considered a reflection of her life in the Altiplano, and her personality leave a mark on the film.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} it is all nonsense," [...] said Mrs. Sefton slowly, [...] "but if you had lived a whole year {{in the same house}} with Miriam Gordon, you would have been tainted too. Not that she had 'theories'--at least, she never aired them if she had. But there was simply {{something}} about the girl herself that gave a person strange impressions. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> first <b>met</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> had the most uncanny feeling that she was all spirit--soul--what you will! no flesh, anyhow. That feeling wore off after a while, but she never seemed like other people to me.|$|R
6000|$|And {{then the}} {{knowledge}} suddenly {{came to me}} that I knew the face. Where had I seen <b>her,</b> and <b>when?</b> <b>I</b> had <b>met</b> <b>her</b> and spoken to her. The picture smiled at me, as if rallying me on my forgetfulness. I put it back upon its shelf, and sat racking my brains trying to recollect. We had met somewhere--in the country--a long time ago, and had talked of common-place things. To the vision of her clung the scent of roses and the murmuring voices of haymakers. Why had I never seen her again? Why had she passed so completely out of my mind? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; that's {{what they}} thought too. But I never thought of her as {{anything}} but a pretty child. I was civil to her because you wished it; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>her</b> here again, I only tried to see her so that I could talk with her about her sister." ...|$|E
60|$|After that, I often saw my girl as I took my walks abroad, and one {{day could}} not resist {{speaking}} to her <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>her</b> alone; for usually her mates clustered round her like bees about their queen, which pleased me, since it showed how much they loved the sunshiny child.|$|E

60|$|Grace partly approves of the foregoing, for {{she laid}} by her sewing {{to read the}} loose sheets beside me, bending down until her hair, which is bronze-gold with the sun in it, just touched my own. It may be that my eyes are prejudiced, but I {{have never seen a}} woman who might compare with her. Neither has her comeliness faded. Instead, it has grown even more refined and stately, for Grace had always a queenly way, since the day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>met</b> <b>her,</b> the fairest maid--I think so now, though it is long ago--that ever trod the bleak moorlands of eastern Lancashire.|$|R
6000|$|If {{some one}} {{had asked him}} in those days, [...] "In confidence--are you {{in love with this}} girl?" [...] he would have replied: [...] "In love? What is love?

If you mean do I admire her youth and prettiness, do my senses ache a little <b>when</b> <b>I</b> see her moving about--yes! Do I think she will keep me straight, make me a creditable wife and a good mother for my children?--again, yes!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{first person}} I saw, whom I knew, was the Duchess of Longueville, more {{beautiful}} than <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>met</b> <b>her</b> before as Mademoiselle de Bourbon, perfectly dazzling, indeed, with her majestic bearing and exquisite complexion, but the face had entirely lost that innocent, wistful expression that had so much enchanted me before. Half a dozen gentlemen were buzzing round her, and though I once caught her eye {{she did not know}} me, and no wonder, for I was much more changed than she was. However, there I stood forlorn, in an access of English shyness, not daring to take a chair near any of the strangers, and looking in vain for my mother or one of my brothers.|$|R
6000|$|June smiled upon us once more; {{and on the}} {{afternoon}} of the 13th, the anniversary of our first lunch together at the Le Geyts, I was up at my work in the accident ward at St. Nathaniel's.

60|$|I knew it, though, for Mr. Frank told me. He hadn't a bit {{of pride}} about him.

Good lissom figure, that looked as if it had never been boxed up in a pair of stays. Eyes that made me feel as if I was under a pretty stiff cross-examination the moment she looked at me. Fine red, kiss-and-come-again sort of lips. Cheeks and complexion--No, Mr. Artist, you wouldn't identify her by her cheeks and complexion, if I drew you a picture of them this very moment. She has had a family of children since the time I'm talking of; and her cheeks are a trifle fatter, and her complexion is a shade or two redder now, than <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>met</b> <b>her</b> out walking with Mr. Frank.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} reports the psychotherapeutic process {{of a school}} refusal case and tries to examine the {{symbolic}} expressions {{that appeared in the}} process of therapy. The client is a girl who was 12 ，at the first grade in a junior high school <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>met</b> <b>her.</b> She was treated with the nonverbal psychotherapeutic approach for 18 months. This approach consisted of sand play, Landscape montage technique, Baum-test, drawing, mutual scribble and clay modeling. In the course of therapy, she showed several significant symbolic expressions, especially in drawing. For example, an “enantiodromia” as C. G. Jung put it was represented in drawing at the 9 th session. After that, the "death and rebirth" symbol of transformation appeared. And furthermore, the “Mandala" symbol was expressed in the 15 th session. Meanwhile, she gradually developed a therapeutic regression and became able to express “Amae” to her parents. She began to go to school four months after the onset of the therapy, and continued to strengthen her ego...|$|R
6000|$|The hardest {{critic who}} reads these lines cannot feel more contemptuously toward me than I felt toward myself. Could I still love a woman {{after she had}} {{deliberately}} preferred to me a scoundrel who had married her while he was the husband of another wife? Yes! Knowing what I now knew, I felt that I loved her just as dearly as ever. It was incredible, it was shocking; but it was true. For {{the first time in}} my life, I tried to take refuge from my sense of my own degradation in drink. I went to my club, and joined a convivial party at a supper table, and poured glass after glass of champagne down my throat, without feeling the slightest sense of exhilaration, without losing for an instant the consciousness of my own contemptible conduct. I went to my bed in despair; and through the wakeful night I weakly cursed the fatal evening at the river-side <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>met</b> <b>her</b> for the first time.

Here the doctrine of hereditary transmission of moral qualities must own that it has overlooked the fertility (for growth of good and for growth of evil equally) which is inherent in human nature. There are virtues that exalt us, and vices that degrade us, whose mysterious origin is, not in our parents, but in ourselves. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> think of Helena, I ask myself, where is the trace which reveals that the first murder {{in the world was}} the product of inherited crime? ...|$|R
