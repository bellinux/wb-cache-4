500|$|The band {{spent the}} {{remainder}} {{of the year in the}} studio, recording what would become Seventh Star. Warner Bros. refused to release the album as a Tony Iommi solo release, instead insisting on using the name Black Sabbath. Pressured by the band's manager, Don Arden, the two compromised and released the album as [...] "Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi" [...] in January 1986. [...] "It opened up a whole can of worms really", Iommi explained, [...] "because I think if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it as a solo album, it would have been accepted a lot more." [...] Seventh Star, which sounded little like a Black Sabbath album, incorporated more hard rock elements popularised by the 1980s Sunset Strip hard rock scene, and was panned by the critics of the era, although later reviewers such as Allmusic gave the album favourable reviews, calling the album [...] "often misunderstood and underrated".|$|E

500|$|Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish {{was adamant}} that his players would improve {{following}} the defeat: [...] "They've been in two cup finals {{in this season}} – they'll have enjoyed the first one more than the second, the lads {{will benefit from the}} experience. You can't give a team like Chelsea a two-goal head start." [...] When asked about his future as manager of the club Dalglish stated: [...] "We'll assess the season {{at the end of the}} season." [...] Captain Steven Gerrard echoed Dalglish's sentiments: [...] "With the players we have in that dressing room, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> better. But we are Liverpool. We will bounce back. We will strengthen in the summer and come back fighting again. That's what Liverpool Football Club does." [...] Striker Andy Carroll, who scored one goal and had another disallowed, thought the ball had crossed the line: [...] "I thought it was over the line and you know better than me but I thought it was.

The club has to approach me. I have a contract until 1999. There must be some tough words. For me, the season has been positive". His word was also shared by Bobic who felt that his team were treated unfairly to the goal, also taking time to defend Löw: [...] "We need to talk about mistakes and learn from them, {{it does not mean that}} it is necessary to change the manager". He added: [...] "It is bitter to lose by such a goal". However, Verlaat dissented, and criticised Stuttgart's campaign: [...] "The club has to make up its mind finally. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> better this season.

[...] On {{the design of the}} car he reflected that, [...] "our emphasis tended to be more on the elegance of the chassis structure rather than on the design of a really quick racing car" [...] and that, [...] "we ... tended to go towards technical ingenuity and bullshit rather than racewinning engineering". Team member and later manager of the organisation Teddy Mayer said, [...] "Our main problems were with the choice of the Ford engine." [...] Bruce McLaren's personal secretary and author Eoin Young concurs. The winners of the 1966 drivers' and constructors' championships, Jack Brabham and his eponymous team, used a Repco-modified and badged Oldsmobile engine. It produced approximately 290bhp – less than the Ford – but its light weight and reliability rendered it effective. Despite having used the Oldsmobile in sports racing cars, the McLaren team discounted it. Afterwards, Mayer said, [...] "We considered it, but the kind of modifications which Repco did were well beyond our resources, and I doubt very much if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> any more with it than we did with the Indy Ford." ...|$|E

Benfica's Manuel Fernandes scored first but could not prevent Paços de Ferreira scoring three second-half goals, thus losing the game. Benfica ended the season in third place, missing out on the title and an {{automatic}} place in the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League. Despite winning both games against Porto, the closest Benfica had come from them was on the 18 and 19 match-days, with only three points. Benfica closed the season 12 points behind the leader and five from Sporting. Of the Big Three, Benfica conceded the most goals (29) and scored the second-highest number of goals (51), with the worst goal-average (+22). Koeman wanted to fulfil his contract with Benfica, but after negotiations with the management and sudden interest from PSV, Benfica opted to release him on mutual terms. Koeman thanked Luís Filipe Vieira and José Veiga for their support in face of repeated criticism, and said, [...] "This is very big club, but you cannot win all the time, although I admit, that in the Primeira Liga, {{he did not do}} everything he could. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> better.

[...] Vedder stated, [...] "The new record feels good so far—really strong and uptempo, stuff we can sink our teeth into", and added that the band's live performances inspired the album's sound: [...] "At one of our gigs, without flashpots and electricity, there's only so much room for those difficult listening songs. That's one reason we kept the arrangements lean." [...] The singer cited Guided by Voices as a reference in creating the shorter and faster songs of Backspacer. Gossard said that Backspacer is [...] "what <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> for the last five records, in terms of re-engaging with the roots of why this band works", and that [...] "there's plenty of ballads, too... and there's some shifts in how Jeff and Matt and I are all relating—I think this record's got a chance to sound significantly different."

500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so.

500|$|In 2009 Frank {{responded to}} what he called [...] "wholly {{inaccurate}} efforts by Republicans to blame Democrats, and [...] in particular" [...] for the subprime mortgage crisis, which {{is linked to the}} financial crisis of 2007–2009. He outlined his efforts to reform these institutions and add regulations, but met resistance from Republicans, with the main exception being a bill with Republican Mike Oxley that died because of opposition from President Bush. The 2005 bill included Frank objectives, which were to impose tighter regulation of Fannie and Freddie and new funds for rental housing. Frank and Mike Oxley achieved broad bipartisan support for the bill in the Financial Services Committee, and it passed the House. But the Senate never voted on the measure, in part because President Bush was likely to veto it. [...] "If it had passed, that would {{have been one of the}} ways we could have reined in the bowling ball going downhill called housing," [...] Oxley told Frank. In an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote that Frank [...] "is the only politician I know who has argued that we needed tighter rules that intentionally produce fewer homeowners and more renters." [...] Once control shifted to the Democrats, Frank was able to help guide both the Federal Housing Reform Act (...) and the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (...) to passage in 2007. Frank also said that the Republican-led Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999, which repealed part of the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933 and removed the wall between commercial and investment banks, contributed to the financial meltdown. Frank stated further that [...] "during twelve years of Republican rule no reform was adopted regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 2007, a few months after I became the Chairman, the House passed a strong reform bill; we sought to get the [...] administration's approval to include it in the economic stimulus legislation in January 2008; and finally got it passed and onto President Bush's desk in July 2008. Moreover, [...] "we were able to adopt it in nineteen months, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it much quicker if the [...] administration had cooperated." ...|$|E
