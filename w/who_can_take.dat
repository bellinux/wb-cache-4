5|$|The {{next year}} in 1934 at Alcatraz Island, Ladd Russo befriends Firo, who was framed by fellow Immortal Victor Talbot for the Mist Wall public bombing and Isaac, who was finally caught for his thefts, leaving Miria morose from his arrest. All three men meet Huey Laforet in {{separate}} occasions, who was charged with treason and conspiracy years ago with affiliation to the Lemures among other terrorist acts. Meanwhile, Christopher Shouldered, Huey's homunculus, and Graham Specter, Ladd's loyal follower, cause an all out war in Chicago through various battles enacted by the Lamia, Nebula and the Russo family led by a now immortal Placido Russo with each battling for their lives. Afterwards, Jacuzzi and his gang return to Chicago while Ladd attempts to kill Huey and fails thanks {{to the efforts of}} Isaac, Firo and Chane's homunculus sister, Leeza Laforet; however, the scuffle resulted in Huey's eye taken with the help of Lamia operative Sham, a homunculus <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> over one's consciousness by contact through his body in the form of water. The homunculus group Lamia (associated with Larvae, the group previously encountered by the cast in 1933) cause trouble for the Russo family while this happens. Several of the Lamia join their forces and others split after the conflict, particularly Christopher joining with the Russo family to protect the androgynous heir Ricardo Russo along with Lamia member Sickle and Graham Spector. Isaac is eventually released from Alcatraz along with Firo after fulfilling their mission. Placido Russo, Ricardo's grandfather and Ladd's uncle, is eventually turned immortal and consumed by Nebula scientist Renee for his failure in stopping the rampage of Chicago, resulting in Ricardo inheriting the crime family.|$|E

25|$|The museum's {{popularity}} {{has led to}} some problems. Visitors stand in line in the museum foyer to take an elevator down to the underground level where the exhibits start with the Middle Passage and slavery. The hallway there {{is designed to be}} cramped and somewhat claustrophobic. The large number of visitors who stop to read the exhibit's signs has caused dangerous overcrowding. Museum officials have had {{to limit the number of}} people <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> the elevator (and thus enter the exhibit) to mitigate this problem. This has led to still longer lines in the foyer.|$|E

The Philippine National Police has a special police force on the MRT-3, and security police provided by private companies can be found in all MRT-3 stations. All MRT-3 stations have a head guard. Some stations may also have a deployed K9 bomb-sniffing dog. The MRT-3 also employs the use of closed-circuit television inside all stations to monitor suspicious activities and to assure safety and security aboard the line.

Folk traditions in China and other East Asian countries have added many distinctive characteristics and legends to Guanyin c.q. Avalokiteśvara. Avalokiteśvara was originally depicted as a male bodhisattva, and therefore wears chest-revealing clothing and may even sport a light moustache. Although this depiction still exists in the Far East, Guanyin is more often depicted as a woman in modern times. Additionally, some people believe that Guanyin is androgynous or perhaps without gender.|$|E

500|$|The tengu in art {{appears in}} a variety of shapes. [...] It usually falls somewhere between a large, monstrous bird and a wholly anthropomorphized being, often with a red face or an unusually large or long nose. Early depictions of tengu show them as kite-like beings <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> a human-like form, often {{retaining}} avian wings, head or beak. The tengu's long nose seems to have been conceived in the 14th century, likely as a humanization of the original bird's bill. This feature allies them with the Shinto deity Sarutahiko, who is described in the Japanese historical text the Nihon Shoki with a similar nose measuring seven hand-spans in length. [...] In village festivals the two figures are often portrayed with identical red, phallic-nosed mask designs.|$|E

500|$|Resident Evil 3 {{uses the}} same game engine as its predecessors. The environments consist of 2D pre-rendered {{backgrounds}} while moving objects such as enemies and some interactive elements consist of 3D polygon graphics. The developers chose this technique because having full 3D graphics would {{not allow them to}} create graphically rich and detailed environments. According to project supervisor Yoshiki Okamoto, [...] "the number of polygons allocated for the enemies would not be sufficient. We did not want to have blocky, pixelated zombies." [...] Interaction with the environment was improved so that the player could shoot objects like explosive barrels to damage enemies. Developers also added more variety of zombies, <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> the form of policemen, doctors, and ordinary citizens, among others.|$|E

[...] Schaaf added that Koen has a [...] "fine eye for art, architecture, fashion, manners and relays the everything," [...] though she critiqued the author for sometimes inserting too many historical details. She believed that the book especially shone in depicting the South Sea Bubble; [...] "most historical writers," [...] Schaaf opined, [...] "neglect the economic background of their periods, regardless of its importance, and [...] grasp of a complicated situation makes it as fascinating as her descriptions of the sexual behavior of the upper and lower classes." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} in the United Kingdom, in November 2012, by Quercus, a London-based independent publishing house. The review in The Daily Telegraph concluded that [...] "while there are flashes of brilliance here, there's also a nagging sense that he's snatching at snowflakes. Time and time again one comes across statements that look, and sound good - these pieces were originally delivered as lectures - but which just don't stand up to analysis." [...] The reviewer cited examples, like the illustrations of the theatrics people display when coming in from the cold and the isolated feelings of downhill skiers which the reviewer rebutted with similar examples of the same that occur in temperate climates. Nick Rennison reviewed the book for The Sunday Times, writing that [...] "any writer <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> subjects as diverse as ....and find something original and interesting to say about each of them, has to be worth reading." ...|$|E

[...] "He doesn't appear as if he's supremely self-assured. [...] He's more of a regular kid <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> on the complexities of the role and become a hero". Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as [...] "a very distinctive actor.
