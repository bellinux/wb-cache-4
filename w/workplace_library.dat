Contemporary 21 st Century libraries face unprecedented challenges. Anticipating appropriate responses depends on activating and extending what organizational members know {{and how they}} leverage it. To develop a more 'knowledge-able' <b>workplace,</b> <b>library</b> faculty and staff at California Polytechnic State University employ evidence-driven systems thinking (Checkland/United Kingdom) fortified by workplace information literacy (Bruce/Australia). This knowledge creating approach to evidence-based information practice informs repurposing the library, re-inventing systems, and refocusing personnel. Boundary crossing information exchange and reflective dialogue promote appreciative inquiry and enable collective sense-making. Shared commitment to collaborative participatory design activities ensure consideration of diverse stakeholders’ viewpoints and intensify interactions with student and faculty user communities. In transforming data into evidence through dialogue, relationships, roles, and responsibilities continuously evolve. Intersubjective capacity building promotes ongoing learning among library colleagues and with campus stakeholders. Interactive evaluation and assessment outcomes ensure heightened levels of engagement with the learner and alignment with the institution...|$|E
40|$|RMIT University was {{the first}} to offer a {{comprehensive}} Masters of Toxicology in Australasia 19 years ago. In 2001 the program was transformed into two stages, leading to a Graduate Diploma and Master of Applied Science in Toxicology. Now, these programs are fully online and suitable for graduates living and working anywhere in the world. The modular distance-learning courses are specifically designed to equip students with essential skills for entering fields such as chemical and drug evaluation; risk assessment of chemicals in the workplace; environmental and food toxicology. RMIT&# 039;s online course delivery system has made it possible to deliver the toxicology programs, both nationally and internationally. The learning material and interactive activities (tests and quizzes, discussion boards, chat sessions) use Blackboard and WebBoard, each with a different educational function. Students log in to a Learning Hub to access their courses. The Learning Hub enables students to extend their learning beyond the classroom to the home, <b>workplace,</b> <b>library</b> and any other location with Internet access. The teaching staff log in to the Learning Hub to maintain and administer the online programs and courses which they have developed and/or which they teach. The Learning Hub is also a communication tool for students and staff, providing access to email, a diary and announcements. The early experience of delivering a full toxicology program online is very positive. However this mode of teaching continues to present many interesting technical, educational and cultural challenges, including: the design and presentation of the material; copyright issues; internationalisation of content; interactive participation; and the assessment procedures...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to provide {{understanding}} regarding the future of <b>library</b> <b>workplaces</b> by, first, establishing the relationship between Joseph Campbell's functions of mythology in traditional cultures and workplace texts, and then showing <b>libraries</b> as <b>workplaces</b> with such texts. With this framework in place, {{it is possible to}} pick-out the fundamental cycle inherent in <b>library</b> <b>workplace</b> cosmology, highlight pedagogical cycles inherent in library texts, and generate an informed understanding of future cosmological and pedagogical trends using educated extrapolation of such cycles. These steps all serve to lay further groundwork in understanding <b>library</b> <b>workplace</b> mythology and its sociological effects, and, using the relationship between ever-moving cosmological and pedagogical cycles, it becomes possible to form an educated picture of future library sociology. In the end, <b>library</b> <b>workplace</b> mythology has no new revelations about the direction of <b>library</b> <b>workplace</b> sociology, only new ways of dispelling predictions often made about the future of <b>libraries</b> and their <b>workplaces.</b> By looking at <b>library</b> <b>workplaces</b> as sites of mythology, this work offers expectations that the same cycles inherent in past and present <b>library</b> <b>workplaces</b> will continue to overcome changes in the technological, political, and social constructs of future <b>library</b> <b>workplaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report on survey results from a study about librarians’ {{experience}} with compensation (salary and benefits) negotiation in the <b>library</b> <b>workplace</b> in order to provide data that will inform professional discourse and practice. Design/methodology/approach - A primarily quantitative survey instrument was administered via Qualtrics Survey Software and distributed through listservs and social media channels representing a range of library types and sub-disciplines. The survey was explicitly addressed to librarians for participation and asked them questions related to their work history and experience with negotiating for salary and benefits. Findings - A total of 1, 541 librarians completed the survey. More than half of survey respondents reported not negotiating for their current library position. The majority of those who did negotiate reported positive outcomes, including an increase in salary or total compensation package. Only a very small number of respondents reported threats to rescind or rescinded offers when negotiating for their current positions. Respondents cited prior salary and prior work experience and/or education as the top information sources informing negotiation strategy. Originality/value - There is minimal discussion of salary and benefits negotiation by individuals in the library literature and prior surveys of librarians’ experience with compensation negotiation do not exist.

Everyday, {{more and more of the}} world 2 ̆ 7 s population is connected to this growing minefield of information, many of whom use it to seek out services they need. Health services are amongst the many purchasable products currently available online. The Internet, thus, is a viable method of contacting populations that a provider would not traditionally be able to reach. A growing service in this area is the practice of Internet-based psychotherapy. This goes by many other names as well, such as e-counseling, telecounseling, web therapy, computer mediated counseling, Interapy, and many other variations. ^ This paper reviews the current available literature on the efficacy and associated concerns of Internet-based psychotherapy through the RE-AIM lens. After an evaluation of the selected studies, Internet-based psychotherapy may be able to reach a wider audience than with traditional means and also produces similar efficacy results to in-person therapy. However, providers are still reluctant to adopt Internet-based psychotherapy due to legal concerns, and long-term maintenance of these practices may be an issue. Further research into the effectiveness, cost, and legal issues surrounding Internet-based psychotherapy is recommended. ...|$|R
40|$|Ubiquitous {{learning}} {{is more than}} just the latest educational idea or method. At its core the term conveys a vision of learning that is connected across all the stages on which we play at our lives. Learning occurs not just in classrooms, but in the home, <b>workplace,</b> playground, <b>library,</b> museum, nature center, and in our daily interactions with others. Moreover, learning becomes part of doing; we do not learn in order to live more fully but rather learn as we live to the fullest. Learning happens through active engagement, and significantly, it is no longer identified with reading a text or listening to lectures but rather occurs through all the senses - sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. It is understandable to think that ubiquitous computing is necessary for this kind of ubiquitous learning and sufficient to make it possible. Education would certainly be easier to promote if we could simply identify some new technologies that would make ubiquitous learning occur. But in the sense presented above, the new technologies are neither necessary nor sufficient for this to happen. This chapter develops these ideas further, arguing that it is our vision for ubiquitous learning that matters most, not just the technical affordances. We need to define ubiquitous learning in a historically legitimate way, one that recognizes the possibilities presented by the new technologies without reducing the argument to a technocentric position...|$|R

40|$|This study endeavoured to {{establish}} what influences students to undertake library and information studies. Are prospective students of library and information studies choosing their course and future occupation {{for the same}} sorts of reasons as in the past? Are prospective students well informed about their future occupation when they choose a course of study? What is {{the relative importance of}} some of the factors influencing their choice? Do metropolitan, regional and isolated students have the same understanding and expectations of their course and future occupation? A study of first year undergraduate students of library and information studies at three universities sought to provide answers to these questions. A quantitative and qualitative comparison of first year undergraduate students of Library and Information Studies at the University of Canberra and a random group from the same University was also undertaken in order to provide some comparative data. The findings showed that reasons for choosing library and information studies have generally not changed as much as one might expect. An interest in books and reading still ranks as a relatively important factor in students' choice, though there is some evidence of an increased interest in career and employment issues. Library and information studies students without an occupational background in the discipline generally have a hazy picture of what is involved in their future occupation and this lack of knowledge is compounded where students are located in regional or isolated areas.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years there has been a {{proliferation}} of new kinds of retail space. Retail space has cropped up just about everywhere in the urban landscape: in <b>libraries,</b> <b>workplaces,</b> churches and museums. In short, retail is becoming a more and more manifest part of the public domain. The traditional spaces of retail, such as city centres and outlying shopping malls, are either increasing in size or disappearing, producing new urban types and whole environments totally dedicated to retail. The creation of these new retail spaces has brought about a re- and de-territorialisation of urban public space, and has also led to transformations in urban design and type of materials used, and even in the logic and ways through which these design amenities meet the needs of retailers and/or consumers. This book describes how the retailisation of public domains affects our everyday life and our use of the built environment. Taking an architectural and territorial perspective on this issue, it looks specifically at how retail and consumption spaces have changed and territorialised urban life in different ways. It then develops a methodology and a set of concepts to describe and understand the role of architecture in these territorial transformations...|$|R

We explore how diversity in the academic library workforce can have positive effects in dispelling stereotypes through visibility, outreach, and education. We also want to rethink what we mean when we discuss diversity and what it entails. This {{is important to the}} process of examining library diversity initiatives and how they can fall short of complete inclusion. We also explore how activist librarians have defied the librarian stereotype and what we can learn from them. In order to create desired changes, we also need to see what the field is currently doing in terms of recruiting for diversity and {{what we can do to}} create a culture of inclusion at our institutions. Academic libraries are in the position to reimagine their place on campus to be more than just a warehouse for books, and many are well along in this process.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{overview}} of the preparedness of vocational education and training (VET) sector library staff in Australia and New Zealand to deliver services to mobile technologies. Design/methodology: A representative sample of staff from 14 Australasian VET libraries was selected, including three positions from each library: Library Manager, Systems Librarian and Qualified Librarian. Data from the sample were exposed to two levels of analysis, both qualitative and quantitative. A slightly-modified version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model was employed as a predictor of behavioural intention and use behaviour. This model allowed granular level of detail to emerge through the capacity to drill down to individual characteristics influencing predictability to accept technology innovation. Findings: An evaluative summary is provided of the workforce competencies and skills that 42 VET library staff viewed as critical and necessary to meet the new technologically-enhanced professional environment. The paper also presents findings on the best approach to identifying if skills are lacking and preferred methods for addressing deficits. The impact of staff demographics upon identified skills requirements and preferred training implementation are examined. Practical implications: In a field where previous research is sparse and empirical investigations even fewer, the findings discussed in this paper offer meaningful insights to library and information science practitioners with particular reference to mobile <b>libraries,</b> <b>workplace</b> training, technology adoption and library service provision. ...|$|R
