Patients <b>with</b> secondary progressive <b>multiple</b> sclerosis had significantly greater lesion loads for five of seven periventricular regions and for three of nine regions separate from the ventricles. Patients <b>with</b> secondary progressive <b>multiple</b> sclerosis also had more severe infratentorial atrophy scores (p = 0. 04), whereas there were no {{differences between the two groups}} in number and extent of enhancing lesions. The frequencies were significantly higher and severities greater for multimodal EP abnormalities of all the modalities in patients <b>with</b> secondary progressive <b>multiple</b> sclerosis. At least one EP component was absent in 12 (92 %) patients <b>with</b> secondary progressive <b>multiple</b> sclerosis but in only one patient (8 %) <b>with</b> benign <b>multiple</b> sclerosis (p < 0. 001). There was neurophysiological evidence for cervical cord involvement in eight (61 %) patients <b>with</b> secondary progressive <b>multiple</b> sclerosis and in one <b>with</b> benign <b>multiple</b> sclerosis (p < 0. 01).

A {{qualitative study}} of parents perceptions about pain in their non-verbal child <b>with</b> severe <b>multiple</b> disabilities, {{and how it}} affects {{activities of daily living}} in the family. Purpose: The purpose of this master thesis is to describe parents‟ experiences with pain in children <b>with</b> severe <b>multiple</b> disabilities, and how they perceive that pain affects naturally occurring activities of daily living in the family. This knowledge can help more effective healthcare provision for pain that better meets the needs of the family. Research questions: This project explored the following two research questions: How do parents perceive and communicate about pain and discomfort in a non-verbal child <b>with</b> severe <b>multiple</b> disabilities? How does pain and discomfort in a non-verbal child <b>with</b> severe <b>multiple</b> disabilities affect activities of daily living in the family? Theoretical Framework: This project views a child <b>with</b> severe <b>multiple</b> disabilities within the context of his or her family, and in mutual relation to other systems as presented in Bronfenbrenner‟s Ecological Developmental Model (1979). The first research question is based on perspectives on interaction and symbolic interactionism. The second research question includes perspectives on interaction, coping and caregiving. Method: This project is a qualitative study involving parents of school-aged children <b>with</b> severe <b>multiple</b> disabilities experiencing pain or discomfort. Data collection occurred through semi-structured life world interview technique. The data were analyzed by a phenomenological approach, utilizing a thematic analysis inspired by Giorgi (1975) as described by (Malterud, 2008). Findings: Pain in a child <b>with</b> severe <b>multiple</b> disabilities appears to {{have a negative effect on}} naturally occurring activities of daily living in the family. Parents have expert practical knowledge regarding their child and identifying and handling pain behaviors and appearances within the context of naturally occurring activities of daily living in the family.

This paper explores the issues relevant to women <b>with</b> a <b>multiple</b> pregnancy to support a positive birth experience. One of the foundations of childbirth education and nursing care is to provide the individual woman and her family with knowledge regarding the birth process, what to expect, and {{how to cope with}} labor and birth. Education also focuses on caring for the newborns after birth and how to manage in the early days at home. However, traditional childbirth education classes, which meet in a series of evenings or Saturdays, may not meet the needs of women <b>with</b> a <b>multiple</b> pregnancy. In addition, because of the differences in care that exist for women <b>with</b> a <b>multiple</b> pregnancy, new paradigms for childbirth education are needed to meet the learning needs of these families. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide information to the childbirth educator on the differences in care women <b>with</b> a <b>multiple</b> pregnancy can expect and to suggest strategies to meet the childbirth education needs of these families...|$|R
