25|$|From Pausanias <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> Selene was {{supposed}} to have had by Endymion fifty daughters, who possibly represented the fifty lunar months of the Olympiad. Nonnus has Selene and Endymion as the parents of the beautiful Narcissus, but in other accounts, including Ovid's Metamorphoses, Narcissus was the son of Cephissus and Liriope.|$|E
25|$|Heraclea was {{certainly}} {{at this time}} in alliance with the Tarentines and Lucanians against Rome; and it was doubtless with the view of detaching it from this alliance that the Romans were induced shortly afterwards (278BCE) to grant to the Heracleans a treaty of alliance on such favorable terms that it is called by Cicero prope singulare foedus. Heraclea preserved this privileged condition throughout the period of the Roman Republic; and hence, even when in 89BCE the Lex Plautia Papiria conferred upon its inhabitants, in common with the other cities of Italy, the rights of Roman citizens, they hesitated long whether they would accept the proffered boon. <b>We</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> Heraclea surrendered under compulsion to Hannibal in 212BCE. We have no account of the part taken by Heraclea in the Social War; but from an incidental notice in Cicero, that all the public records of the city had been destroyed by fire at that period, it would seem to have suffered severely. Cicero nevertheless speaks of it, in his defence of the poet Aulus Licinius Archias (who had been adopted as a citizen of Heraclea), as still a flourishing and important town, and it appears to {{have been one of the}} few Greek cities in the south of Italy that still preserved their consideration under the Roman dominion. Its name is unaccountably omitted by the 2nd century AD geographer Ptolemy; but its existence at a much later period is attested by the Antonine Itinerary and the Tabula Peutingeriana. It was still a place of some importance under the empire; a branch road from Venusia joined the coast road at Heraclea.|$|E
2500|$|Jazani {{would explain}} that a revolutionary status {{does not exist}} in the country and in {{addition}} to that a revolution does not result from armed struggle rather it comes about as a development of a political, social, economical, and ideological process. A military uprising should be staged at the time of- and not before the revolution, as it does not cause a revolution by itself. In his opinion, those who are for a military uprising are similar to the Shah who is blocking a peaceful means of struggle. Because of this without talking about Ahmadzadeh, Jazani writes [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> revolution begins with a military uprising, we {{have to say that the}} believers of this train of thought do not know two things: one the current situation of military uprising and second revolution in general and the revolution we want is a specific one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Coming Home {{was first}} {{announced}} in June 2006, {{with the band}} citing a scheduled release date of September, with lead single [...] "It's Not Your Fault" [...] preceding the album in July. [...] "It's Not Your Fault" [...] was released to radio on July 25. The music video for [...] "It's Not Your Fault" [...] would eventually make its worldwide debut on August 1 through Total Request Live. On August 29, the band revealed the album's track listing. A week prior to the album's release, the band posted a mock open letter to Lionel Richie, who was also about to release a new album {{of the same name}} the following week. The band jokingly threatened to name their next project Dancing on the Ceiling (Richie's 1986 album), writing, [...] "Congrats this week on the release of your new CD Coming Home - what an awesome title!

2500|$|According to tradition, Philemon did free Onesimus, {{and both}} were {{eventually}} recognized as saints by the Church. T. David Curp asserts that, [...] "Given that the Church received Philemon as inspired Scripture, Paul's ambiguity effectively blocked the early Fathers of the Church from denouncing slavery outright." [...] As an example, Curp points out that St. John Chrysostom, in his sermon on Philemon, considers Paul's sending Onesimus back to his master a sign that slavery should not be abolished. However, in his Homilies on Philemon, Chrysostom actually opposes unfair and unjust forms of slavery by stating that those who own slaves are to passionately love their slaves with the very Love of Christ for humanity: [...] "this ... is the glory of a Master, to have grateful slaves. And this is the glory of a Master, that He should thus love His slaves ... Let us therefore be stricken with awe at this so great love of Christ. Let us be inflamed with this love-potion. Though a man be low and mean, yet if <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> he loves us, we are above all things warmed with love towards him, and honor him exceedingly. And do we then love? And when our Master loves us so much, we are not excited?".|$|E
