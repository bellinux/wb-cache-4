5|$|Both Pavilions were {{scheduled}} to be unveiled on June 19, 2009. However, the Pavilion by Hadid endured construction delays and a construction team change, which led to nationwide coverage of the delay in publications such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Only its skeleton was availed to the public on the scheduled date, and the work was completed and unveiled on August 4, 2009. The van Berkel pavilion endured a temporary closure due to unanticipated <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> from August 1014.|$|E
5|$|Both pavilions were {{scheduled}} to be unveiled on June 19, 2009. However, Hadid's pavilion was not ready in time; it had construction delays and a construction team change, which led to coverage of the delay in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Only its aluminum skeleton was available for public viewing on the scheduled date; the work was completed and unveiled on August 4, 2009. The van Berkel pavilion was temporarily closed for repairs August 10–14, due to unanticipated <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear.</b> Both pavilions were dismantled after November 1, 2009; the materials from van Berkel's were recycled, while Hadid's was stored for possible exhibition elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Composite {{materials}} make up 43% of the airframe, and the proprotor blades {{also use}} composites. For storage, the V-22's rotors fold in 90 seconds and its wing rotates to align, front-to-back, with the fuselage. Due to {{the requirement for}} folding rotors, their 38-foot diameter is 5 feet less than optimal for vertical takeoff, resulting in high disk loading. Most missions use fixed wing flight 75% {{or more of the}} time, reducing <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> and operational costs. This fixed wing flight is higher than typical helicopter missions allowing longer range line-of-sight communications for improved command and control.|$|E

3000|$|... omplex {{engineering}} systems usually {{operate in}} harsh operational and environmental conditions. By the time, the system itself, subsystems, and components examine performance degradation. This degradation is either due to internal <b>wears</b> <b>and</b> <b>tears</b> during normal operation or due to fault progression. In either case sudden failure could happen which implies to total system loss and endangers human lives.|$|R
5|$|In practice, the {{flexibility}} which the OBO design allows has gone largely unused, as these ships tend {{to specialize in}} either the liquid or dry bulk trade. Also, these ships have endemic maintenance problems. On one hand, due to a less specialized design, an OBO suffers more from <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> during dry cargo onload than a bulker. On the other hand, components of the liquid cargo system, from pumps to valves to piping, tend to develop problems when subjected to periods of disuse. These factors have contributed to a steady {{reduction in the number}} of OBO ships worldwide since the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two basic}} {{aerodynamic}} models of insect flight. Most insects use a method that creates a spiralling leading edge vortex. Some very small insects use the fling and clap or Weis-Fogh mechanism in which the wings clap together above the insect's body and then fling apart. As they fling open, the air gets sucked in and creates a vortex over each wing. This bound vortex then moves across the wing and, in the clap, acts as the starting vortex for the other wing. Circulation and lift are increased, {{at the price of}} <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> on the wings.|$|E
5|$|Bristol Rovers {{denied that}} they were {{interested}} in signing Fortune-West in June 2003, before Doncaster Rovers of the Third Division signed him on a two-year contract. His first season with the club, 2003–04, saw him score 12 goals in 43 appearances as they won the Third Division championship, earning promotion to the Second Division. During this season, he formed a strike partnership with Gregg Blundell. Fortune-West suffered a knee injury caused by <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> to the knee joint in October 2004, which resulted in him undergoing surgery, before returning to the team in March 2005. He was to be offered a new deal in April 2005 and finished the season with 7 goals in 28 appearances. The 2005–06 season was his last with Doncaster, as he was released after scoring 4 goals in 33 appearances.|$|E
50|$|Jaw muscles do not display very {{prominent}} changes in muscular tissue with age in healthy elderly, as their oral cavities are in constant motor movement (i.e.: performing {{tasks such as}} talking and chewing etc.). This motion delays the decrease in lean body mass and aids protein retention that comes with age, preventing the muscular tissues from <b>wearing</b> <b>and</b> <b>tearing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{collecting}} and restoring of antique linens can be complex, {{depending upon the}} condition of the cloth. Many old household linens were stored filled with starch, which damages the cloth over time since it hardens <b>and</b> causes <b>wearing</b> <b>and</b> <b>tears</b> in the fabric where it is folded and creased. The owner of an antique linen must determine if conserving, repairing, or mending are appropriate.|$|R
40|$|Tests were perfomed on the <b>wearing</b> <b>and</b> <b>tearing</b> of {{double-edged}} rectangular punches {{and on the}} shearing of 0. 25 mm thick Kovar sheets {{by using}} the punches. Ten rectangular punches with the slenderness ratio ranging from 8. 7 to 80. 7 {{were used in the}} experiment. The <b>wearing</b> <b>and</b> <b>tearing</b> of the cutting edges and the bending and breakage of the punches were examined. The unbalanced side shearing force which produced local abnormal <b>wears,</b> breakages, <b>and</b> other defects of the punches and their edges maight have been caused by scraps remaining on the die face, the uneven wears on the cutting edges, and the local uneveness in tool clearance and work material. Such abnormal <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> breakage can be prevented by making a smaller clearance between the blank holder and the punch than that of the clearance between the punch and die. By observing the defective edges of the punches and the dies using an X-ray microanalyser, it has been made clear that particles of the work material have adhered to the side suface of the tools. From this observation it can be conclude that the tool wear in this case belongs to the adhesive wear...|$|R
5|$|De Soto {{continued}} her patrols in the Gulf of Mexico into {{the month of}} August, braving the sweltering heat to board and inspect coastal and seaborne traffic. The steamer Alice Vivian was seized on 16 August, as she had no papers, and the steamer Nita was taken the next day for the same reason. During this month, <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> on the steamer's boilers began to show and, despite attempts at repair, De Soto steadily lost speed. On 12 September, following a nine-hour chase under steam and sail, the Union ship finally took the blockade runner Montgomery, a chase Capt. Walker claimed should have taken one fourth the time if the boilers were in good order. Tinkering helped build up steam pressure to a point, and De Soto managed to chase down the screw steamer Leviathan on 22 September.|$|E
5|$|Returning from Tarawa, Radford was reassigned {{as chief}} of staff to Towers, who was Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet. He {{assisted}} in planning upcoming operations, including Operation Flintlock, the invasion of the Marshall Islands. He had hoped to return to combat duty {{at the end of this}} assignment, but in March 1944 he was ordered to Washington, D.C. and appointed as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. He assumed this new duty on 1 April, a role which was primarily administrative in nature. His duties included establishing a new integrated system for aircraft maintenance, supply, and retirement, for which he was appointed the head of a board to study aircraft <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear.</b> After six months in this duty, Radford was returned to the Pacific theater by Admiral Ernest J. King, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and Commander in Chief, United States Fleet.|$|E
5|$|The A1 route was {{designated}} in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme. Through the inner boroughs of the City, Islington, and Haringey it uses existing roads and streets; {{when it reaches}} {{what is now the}} outer London borough of Barnet, some stretches of purpose-built new roads were built, and others have been widened and made into dual carriageways. In 1828, John Benjamin Macneill, chief engineer to Thomas Telford, used Roman cement and gravel to solve problems with <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> on the Archway Road section of what is now the A1, an innovative technique that was used there for the first time, and is the basis for modern road building.|$|E

30|$|Of course, {{these steps}} are not {{mandatory}} because sometimes the situation changes from one system to another, {{but it can}} be used as a guideline for prognostics system developers. In some cases, diagnostics system could not catch the starting of system degradation, because the degradation phenomenon could not be monitored. This happens when the degradation is due to internal system <b>wears</b> <b>and</b> <b>tears</b> <b>and</b> it is too difficult to have direct sensor readings of its deviation from normal values. In this case, using AI techniques to learn the relation between monitored parameters and system health is the best solution. Many tools from the data mining community can be used to discover the hidden relationships between the monitored parameters to explain the strange behavior of system degradation.|$|R
5|$|The codex {{is poorly}} preserved; the {{surviving}} page fragments display {{a number of}} figures in central Mexican style, combined with Maya numbering and day glyphs. The document is currently held by the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico city and is not on public display. The physics institute of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México subjected the codex to non-destructive testing {{in an effort to}} determine its authenticity. The results were published in 2007 and were mixed; the document apparently contains genuine pre-Columbian materials but certain aspects, such as seemingly artificially induced <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear,</b> are suspect. The researchers concluded that they were unable to prove or disprove the pre-Columbian nature of the codex.|$|E
5|$|With {{progress}} in palaeontology, {{the reputation of}} the models declined. In 1895, the American fossil hunter Othniel Charles Marsh scorned the dinosaurs' friends as doing them a great injustice, and spoke angrily of the models. The models and the park fell into disrepair as the years went by, a process aided by the fire that destroyed the Crystal Palace itself in 1936, and the models became obscured by overgrown foliage. A full restoration of the animals was carried out in 1952 by Victor H.C. Martin, at which time the mammals on the third island were moved to less well-protected locations in the park, where they were exposed to <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear.</b> The limestone cliff was blown up in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The paper {{used for}} the Grolier Codex appears to be {{authentic}} pre-Columbian bark paper dating from the 13th century. A number of non-destructive techniques have been applied to the codex {{in an effort to}} authenticate it, and the results were published in 2008. The analysis revealed that only pre-Columbian materials had been used in its creation; no modern inorganic materials were detected. Some inconsistencies were revealed however; cuts along the page edges seem to have been made with a sharp blade in order to give the appearance of natural <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> and the supposed water staining did not permeate the paper. The researchers commented that the staining appeared {{to be the result of}} drops of dye or ink being applied to the surface of the codex. In conclusion the researchers were unable to support or refute the pre-Columbian nature of the codex. Unusually for a document that supposedly was stored in a cave for centuries, the paint of the codex still appears fresh.|$|E
30|$|Complex {{engineering}} {{systems are}} always working in harsh operating conditions. Internal <b>wears</b> <b>and</b> <b>tears</b> of such systems {{can lead to}} catastrophic failures which affect system operation and endanger human lives in many cases. To avoid sudden failures, continuous monitoring, fault diagnosis, and failure prognosis are required. Prognostics as a discipline plays the major rule in impending failure prevention. Offline prognostics system focuses on maintenance and logistics operations whereas online prognostics focuses on maintaining safe operation. In a previous work we successfully developed an offline prognostics system for aircraft turbofan engines’ remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. In this paper we will show how we used the offline prognostics system as the baseline definition towards creating an online data-driven prognostics system to enable informed real-time decisions.|$|R

[...] "She confesses everything and it doesn't go very well" [...] and George is not impressed. He thinks [...] "Oh, Esther, not again! You've messed something up again!'" [...] Roberts added [...] "Esther is still his friend, so while he's disappointed, he's not nasty about it." [...] She highlighted that things going wrong for Esther had become an established trait.

5|$|To age the notes, between 40 and 50 prisoners {{stood in}} two columns {{and passed the}} notes among them to {{accumulate}} dirt, sweat and general <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear.</b> Some of the prisoners would fold and refold the notes, others would pin the corners to replicate how a bank clerk would collect bundles of notes. British names and addresses were written on the reverse, as happened with some English notes, and numbers were written on the front – duplicating how a bank teller would mark {{the value of a}} bundle. Four grades of note quality were introduced: grade 1 was the highest quality, to be used in neutral countries and by Nazi spies; grade 2 was to be used to pay collaborators; grade 3 was for notes that were to be possibly dropped over Britain; grade 4 were too flawed to be of use and were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{unlikely}} expedition team ends {{up on the}} Destiny, an Ancient starship located {{billions of}} light-years from Earth. The ship jumps to FTL shortly after the Stargate shuts down. Rush uses an Ancient communication device to contact Stargate command, taking control of Bill Lee (Bill Dow). When he returns, Rush claims that O'Neill put him {{in charge of the}} expedition, though the others are not quick to believe him. Meanwhile, the ship, having suffered millennia of <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear,</b> has a failing life support system and an inadequately sealed hull breach in one of the shuttles, which can be sealed only from inside the shuttle. Senator Armstrong learns of this and, already badly injured, sacrifices his life to seal the shuttle off and buy the team time. However, the main life support is not so easily fixed. The CO2 scrubbers are decayed beyond repair, and within a day carbon dioxide poisoning will kill everyone. The Destiny, apparently aware of the problem, drops out of FTL and dials the Stargate to a desert planet with the necessary materials to repair the scrubbers. Four other locations are listed but locked out by the dialing computer. A 12-hour countdown begins, {{at the end of which}} the Destiny will continue on its journey automatically.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} World War II, T-26s served {{mainly in}} {{separate}} light tank brigades (each brigade had 256–267 T-26s) and in separate tank battalions of rifle divisions (one company of T-26s consisted of 10–15 tanks). These were the type of tank units that participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939 and in the Winter War from December 1939 – March 1940. The Winter War proved that the T-26 was obsolete and its design reserve was totally depleted. Finnish 37mm antitank guns and even 20mm antitank rifles easily penetrated the T-26's thin anti-bullet armour and tank units equipped with the T-26 suffered significant losses during the breakthrough of the Mannerheim Line, in which the flame-throwing tanks based on the T-26 chassis played a significant role.By mid-1941, most of the Red Army's vast numbers of tanks were suffering from serious <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear.</b> Poor quality roads, the vulnerabilities of track design in the early 1930s and inadequate maintenance, recovery and repair services all took their toll. In some of the front line armoured units, {{up to half of}} the T-26, T-28 and BT tanks had major drive train components (engine, drive train or suspension) that were broken down or worn out and these disabled tanks were parked and cannibalised for spare parts to keep the rest running. Tanks damaged during the 1939 Winter War with Finland were also cannibalised for parts.|$|E

40|$|Pedestrian crossing, as an {{important}} part of transportation infrastructures, serves to secure pedestrians’ lives and possessions and keep traffic flow in order. As a prominent feature in the street scene, detection of pedestrian crossing contributes to 3 D road marking reconstruction and diminishing the adverse impact of outliers in 3 D street scene reconstruction. Since pedestrian crossing is subject to <b>wearing</b> <b>and</b> <b>tearing</b> from heavy traffic flow, it is of great imperative to monitor its status quo. On this account, an approach of automatic pedestrian crossing detection using images from vehicle-based Mobile Mapping System is put forward and its defilement and impairment are analyzed in this paper. Firstly, pedestrian crossing classifier is trained with low recall rate. Then initial detections are refined by utilizing projection filtering, contour information analysis, and monocular vision. Finally, a pedestrian crossing detection and analysis system with high recall rate, precision and robustness will be achieved. This system works for pedestrian crossing detection under different situations and light conditions. It can recognize defiled and impaired crossings automatically in the meanwhile, which facilitates monitoring and maintenance of traffic facilities, so as to reduce potential traffic safety problems and secure lives and property...|$|R

5|$|The next day, American forces {{advanced}} to Kirkuk during Operation Option North, hoping to control oil fields and military airfields {{in and around}} the city. Controlling the oil fields had been a specific operational goal of the Task Force because they were viewed as the most valuable strategic asset in northern Iraq. Between 30 March and 2 April, the 173d Airborne Brigade, along with the Special Forces detachment and the Kurdish forces, engaged and destroyed the 2nd, 4th, 8th and 38th Iraqi Infantry divisions as well as a force loyal to Ansar al-Islam. The brigade used field artillery assets, as well as coordinated airstrikes to attack Iraqi Republican Guard units defending the city. Within a week these units began to fall apart due to desertions. On 10 April the brigade was able to move into the city, securing it after a short urban battle. The entire battle for Kirkuk cost the brigade only nine casualties. During the operation, some of the troops discovered at least two caches of Iraqi gold, totaling more than 2,000 bars. The unit then took part in Operation Peninsula Strike, quelling Ba'ath party resistance and other insurgent groups. These operations, though successful, would have been more effective if the 4th Infantry Division's four heavy brigades were able to enter Iraq through Turkey as originally planned. 4th ID had to relocate their forces from Turkey to Kuwait and were subsequently slowed down in Baghdad. VCorps was not able to surround Baghdad as quickly as it had hoped {{because of a lack of}} available forces in the north. The resulting <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> of 4th ID's M1 Abrams and M2 Bradleys made them an ineffective unit in tight urban areas such as Jar Salah. Because their heavily armored tanks required so much maintenance, the 173d incorporated much of 4th ID's area of operation into their own. The 173d secured these areas with company sized detachments, often patrolling the 4th ID's sectors with two unarmored M998 cargo Humvees at any given time.|$|E

50|$|The organic {{covering}} is expanded upon a {{bit more}} in Terminator Genisys. There it is shown that a T-800 {{that has been in}} the past for eleven years has had its organic covering age to match. Kyle Reese expresses surprise at this, and Sarah Connor explains that the covering is like normal human skin and ages like it too, and thus its flesh <b>wears</b> <b>and</b> <b>tears</b> in the same rate as humans. The same T-800 is shown to have aged even further to have white hair and more wrinkles in 2017, thirty-three years later. It is also revealed that a T-800 can regrow a damaged organic covering, though it takes time. It is unknown whether this can be done if the covering is completely destroyed or it needs some covering to regrow from. The T-800 told Sarah that its covering, which had part of it on its face damaged and at least part of the covering on its arm completely burned off by acid, would take years to regrow. However, it did regrow eventually, as in 2017, when the T-800 is shown again, it has its complete covering again. It also may not have taken a great number of years as the T-800 had to blend in with humanity for its preparations for Kyle and Sarah's arrival in the future which included a job in construction.|$|R
