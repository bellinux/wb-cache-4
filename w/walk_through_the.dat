5|$|According to Moberly and Jourdain, the {{two women}} decided to visit the Palace of Versailles as part of several trips. On 10 August 1901, they {{travelled}} by train to Versailles. They did not think much of the palace after touring it, {{so they decided to}} <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> gardens to the Petit Trianon. On the way, they reached the Grand Trianon and found it was closed to the public.|$|E
5|$|As players <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> level, {{they are}} stopped by groups of enemies {{who must be}} {{defeated}} before they can continue. The level ends when all the enemies are defeated. Each level contains many identical groups of enemies, making these games notable for their repetition. In beat 'em up games, players often fight a boss—an enemy much stronger than the other enemies—at {{the end of each}} level.|$|E

5|$|At Philadelphia Mutual Savings Bank, a {{group of}} men led by Agent Mitchell Loeb break in and use a machine that makes it {{possible}} to <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> bank's wall. Several men pass through the wall and steal a safe deposit box numbered 610. One of the men is unable to make it back through however before the wall solidifies again, and he is left stuck inside the wall; Loeb shoots him in the head to prevent him from talking, and they leave.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 124 cast and crew members, 250 local extras were also hired. The majority of the extras were used {{as members of the}} local high school band, chorus and dramatic society that {{can be seen as the}} Brodys <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> town, and during Sean's attack. A local gravestone maker produced 51 slabs for the mock graveyard used for Sean's funeral.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge over}} Swinefleet Warping Drain {{was the subject}} of an unusual request from Colonel Thompson in 1906, who asked {{permission}} for 16 of his female potato pickers to cross it to reach their place of work. To access it, they would need to <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> goods yard and along the main line, but it would save them having to walk much further each day. The request was granted, provided that the Colonel indemnified the railway against any claims made if the ladies were involved in an accident.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell of}} the object is so hard that even a boron nitride drill makes no impression, and when the attempt is made, {{vibrations}} cause severe distress in people around the object.

A hysterical soldier is carried out of the object, claiming to have seen a dwarf-like apparition <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> wall of the artefact, a description that matches a 1927 newspaper account of a ghost.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} shots of a dank {{underground}} sewer.

5|$|William and a tearful Mary {{were married}} in St James's Palace by Bishop Henry Compton on 4 November 1677. Mary {{accompanied}} her husband on a rough sea crossing back to the Netherlands later that month, after a delay of two weeks caused by bad weather. Rotterdam was inaccessible because of ice, and {{they were forced to}} land at the small village of Ter Heijde, and <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> frosty countryside until met by coaches to take them to Huis Honselaarsdijk. On 14 December, they made a formal entry to The Hague in a grand procession.|$|E

As Rachel is about to be wed, Tim, Mr. Will, and Clyde pull {{up in front of the}} church in the red Mustang and rescue her. Mr. Will returns to the community and is accepted back with a confession that Rachel has recorded on the blue cassette, although she still firmly believes that God has fathered her child.

5|$|In May 2006, an auto-update {{was made}} {{available}} on Xbox Live, responsible for fixing some bugs and adding additional multiplayer options to the game. The bug fixes included code {{to prevent an}} ongoing problem where players could <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> air, an issue where some weapons could make use of rapid fire, and a map-exiting glitch, among others. The new multiplayer options provide seven additional new bot types {{and the ability to}} use bots in DarkOps matches, since bots had only one AI variant and were only available in DeathMatch scenarios when the game was released. Additionally, a playable demo of the game was made freely available on the Xbox Live Marketplace shortly afterwards. The demo includes one campaign mission that can be played in solo mode or co-operatively, and a new multiplayer map.|$|E
5|$|Michael takes Holly on a <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> office, {{pointing}} out the locations of various events throughout their courtship. He {{opens the door to}} the kitchen, revealing all of the other employees holding candles. Various members of the office ask Holly if she will marry them (all of Michael's plan) and she politely says no. Michael then leads Holly out to her desk, which is surrounded by dozens of candles. Michael gets down on his knee and begins to make a speech when the sprinklers go off from the candles. The water drenches everyone in the office and Michael proposes. Holly accepts. Everyone then begins to congratulate Michael. However, Michael announces he is moving to Colorado with Holly. The scene ends with his employees in shock.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 1920, King Alexander was {{bitten by}} a monkey during a <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> gardens at Tatoi. The wound became {{infected}} and Alexander developed septicemia. On 19 October, he began to rave and called his mother at his bedside but the Greek government refused to allow Queen Sophia to return to Greece. Worried about her son, and knowing that his grandmother {{was the only other}} royal still in favor with the Venizelists, Sophia asked Olga to go to Athens to care for Alexander. After several days of negotiations, the dowager queen obtained permission to return to Greece but, delayed by rough seas, she arrived twelve hours after her grandson's death on 25 October. On 29 October, Alexander was buried at Tatoi; Olga was {{the only member of the}} royal family at the funeral.|$|E

5|$|Returning to a {{previous}} setting offered the artists new {{challenges and opportunities}} to expand {{the scope of the}} city. Having the player <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets at night inspired a film noir ambiance. Color shifts and a high degree of contrast pushed the game's look beyond what previous Halo games had offered, but the team had to make sure that even dark portions of the city were playable. The entire core development team looked at commissioned concept paintings to decide how lighting schemes would affect the gameplay. The genre also influenced the character names and archetypes. The player character, for example, fits the concept of a lone, hardboiled detective. To increase the depth of the surroundings, Bungie added touches such as advertisements, trash collectors, and civilian versions of previously seen military hardware.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{contingent}} did {{not reach}} {{in time for the}} fighting, the city's capital was taken. Aside from some farm life, the town had been largely abandoned. The taking of the region marked a continuous swath of territory held by Armenians stretching from Karabakh to Armenia proper, a total of 3,000 square kilometers. In the retreat through the Omar Pass of the Murov mountain range, many Azeri refugees froze to death. With the last helicopters leaving on April 1, they were forced to <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> heavy snow at freezing temperatures. Nearly 39,000 civilians were processed into the camps at Yevlakh and Dashkesen with as many as 15,000 unaccounted for. Four Azerbaijani MI-8 helicopters ferrying refugees and wounded out of the conflict zone crashed, the last of which was hit by Armenian forces. Human Rights Watch findings concluded that during the Kalbajar offensive Armenian forces committed numerous violations of the rules of war, including forcible exodus of civilian population, indiscriminate fire and hostage-taking.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to restricting photography of public art, closing {{a public park}} for a private event has also been controversial. In 2005 and 2006, almost all of Millennium Park was closed for a day for corporate events. On both occasions, {{as one of the}} park's primary attractions, Cloud Gate was the focus of controversy. On September 8, 2005, Toyota Motor Sales USA paid $800,000 to rent most venues in the park including Cloud Gate on AT Plaza from 6a.m. to 11p.m. On August 7, 2006, Allstate paid $700,000 to rent the park. For this price, Allstate acquired the visitation rights to a different set of features and only had exclusive access to Cloud Gate after 4p.m. These corporate closures denied tourists access to Kapoor's public sculpture, and commuters who <b>walk</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> park were forced to take alternative routes. City officials stated that the money would help finance free public programs in Millennium Park.|$|E
