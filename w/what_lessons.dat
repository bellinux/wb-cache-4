500|$|Lamont {{gave her}} first post-election {{interview}} to The Politics Show Scotland on 18 December 2011, {{speaking of the}} [...] "huge challenge" [...] of rebuilding public trust in Scottish Labour after its election defeat of the previous May, and a general decline in support over the preceding decade. Attributing the party's losses to its failure to engage with the electorate, she told the programme that Labour needed to speak up for {{the interests of the}} Scottish people, and accept more devolved powers for the Scottish Parliament. Attending her first session of First Minister's Questions as Labour leader on 22 December 2011, she addressed the issue of child neglect following the conviction of a Glasgow woman for the murder of her son and asking <b>what</b> <b>lessons</b> could be learned from the case.|$|E
500|$|Jackson succeeded General Sir Michael Walker as Chief of the General Staff (CGS)—the {{professional}} head of, {{and highest}} post in, the British Army—on 1 February 2003, {{just over a}} month before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He later said that he [...] "did his homework" [...] in researching the disputed legality of the war and had convinced himself that the invasion was legal. Shortly after the invasion of Iraq, Jackson ordered an inquiry into the alleged abuse of Iraqi prisoners by British soldiers. He admitted that the allegations had damaged the Army's reputation, but believed that further damage would be done by covering them up. Several soldiers were eventually convicted in connection with the abuse, after which Jackson publicly apologised on behalf of the British Army and promised to appoint an officer to determine <b>what</b> <b>lessons</b> needed to be learnt. Weeks after becoming CGS, Jackson was summoned to give evidence before the Bloody Sunday Inquiry.|$|E

6000|$|... "Goethe's Life," [...] by Lewes, {{had a great}} {{importance}} for me when it first fell into my hands--a strange instance of the partiality of man's good and man's evil. I know no one whom I less admire than Goethe; he seems a very epitome of the sins of genius, breaking open the doors of private life, and wantonly wounding friends, in that crowning offence of [...] "Werther," [...] and in his own character a mere pen-and-ink Napoleon, conscious of the rights and duties of superior talents as a Spanish inquisitor was conscious of the rights and duties of his office. And yet in his fine devotion to his art, in his honest and serviceable friendship for Schiller, <b>what</b> <b>lessons</b> are contained! Biography, usually so false to its office, does here for once perform for {{us some of the}} work of fiction, reminding us, that is, of the truly mingled tissue of man's nature, and how huge faults and shining virtues cohabit and persevere in the same character. History serves us well to this effect, but in the originals, not {{in the pages of the}} popular epitomiser, who is bound, by the very nature of his task, to make us feel the difference of epochs instead of the essential identity of man, and even in the originals only to those who can recognise their own human virtues and defects in strange forms, often inverted and under strange names, often interchanged. Martial is a poet of no good repute, and it gives a man new thoughts to read his works dispassionately, and find in this unseemly jester's serious passages the image of a kind, wise, and self-respecting gentleman. It is customary, I suppose, in reading Martial, to leave out these pleasant verses; I never heard of them, at least, until I found them for myself; and this partiality is one among a thousand things that help to build up our distorted and hysterical conception of the great Roman empire.|$|E
