25|$|Amenhotep's {{coronation}} can be dated {{without much}} difficulty {{because of a}} number of lunar dates in the reign of his father, Thutmose III. These sightings limit the date of Thutmose's accession to either 1504 or 1479 BC. Thutmose died after 54 years of reign, at which time Amenhotep would have acceded to the throne. Amenhotep's short coregency with his father would then move his accession two years and four months earlier, dating his accession to either 1427 BC in the low chronology, or in 1454 BC in the high chronology. The length of his reign is indicated by a <b>wine</b> <b>jar</b> inscribed with the king's prenomen found in Amenhotep II's funerary temple at Thebes; it is dated to this king's highest known date—his Year 26—and lists the name of the pharaoh's vintner, Panehsy. Mortuary temples were generally not stocked until the king died or was near death; therefore, Amenhotep could not have lived much later beyond his 26th year. There are alternate theories which attempt to assign him a reign of up to 35 years, which is the absolute maximum length he could have reigned. In this chronology, he reigned from 1454 to 1419. However, there are problems facing these theories which cannot be resolved. In particular, this would mean Amenhotep died when he was 52, but an X-ray analysis of his mummy has shown him to have been about 40 when he died. Accordingly, Amenhotep II is usually given a reign of 26 years and said to have reigned from 1427 to 1401 BC.|$|E
500|$|As {{described}} in the Book of the Later Han, {{the frame of the}} seismometer was a domed bronze vessel {{in the shape of a}} <b>wine</b> <b>jar,</b> although it was [...] in diameter and decorated with scenes of mountains and animals. The trigger mechanism was an inverted pendulum (which the Book of the Later Han calls the [...] "central column") that, if disturbed by the ground tremors of earthquakes located near or far away, would swing and strike one of eight mobile arms (representing the eight directions), each with a crank and catch mechanism. The crank and a right angle lever would raise one of eight metal dragon heads located on the exterior, dislodging a metal ball from its mouth that dropped into the mouth of one of eight metal toads below arranged like the points on a compass rose, thus indicating the direction of the earthquake. The Book of the Later Han states that when the ball fell into any one of eight toad mouths, it produced a loud noise which gained the attention of those observing the device. While Wang Zhenduo (王振铎) accepted the idea that Zhang's seismometer had cranks and levers which were disturbed by the inverted pendulum, his contemporary Akitsune Imamura (1870–1948) argued that the inverted pendulum could have had a pin at the top which, upon moving by force of the ground vibrations, would enter one of eight slots and expel the ball by pushing a slider. Since the Book of the Later Han states that the other seven dragon heads would not subsequently release the balls lodged up into their jaws after the first one had dropped, Imamura asserted that the pin of the pendulum would have been locked into the slot it had entered and thus immobilized the instrument until it was reset.|$|E
2500|$|The {{stories told}} of Diogenes {{illustrate}} the logical consistency of his character.

He destroyed the single wooden bowl he possessed on seeing a peasant boy drink from the hollow of his hands. He then exclaimed: [...] "Fool that I am, to have been carrying superfluous baggage all this time!" [...] It was contrary to Athenian customs to eat within the marketplace, and still he would eat there, for, as he explained when rebuked, {{it was during the}} time he was in the marketplace that he felt hungry. He used to stroll about in full daylight with a lamp; when asked what he was doing, he would answer, [...] "I am just looking for an honest man." [...] Diogenes looked for a human being but reputedly found nothing but rascals and scoundrels.|$|E

2500|$|For Staples, the euphemisms are {{agents of}} transformation. The {{designation}} of wine as [...] "milk" [...] conceives {{it as an}} entirely female product, dissociated from the sexually and morally complex realms of Venus and Liber. Likewise, the <b>wine</b> <b>jar</b> described as a [...] "honey jar" [...] refers to bees, which in Roman lore are sexually abstinent, virtuous females who will desert an adulterous household. Myrtle, as the sign of Venus, Faunus' lust and Fauna's unjust punishment, is simply banned; or as Versnel puts it, [...] "Wine in, Myrtle out". The vine-leaf bowers and the profusion of plants [...] any and all but the forbidden myrtle [...] transform the sophisticated, urban banqueting hall into a [...] "primitive" [...] dwelling, evoking the innocence of an ancestral golden age in which women rule themselves, without reference to men or Venus, drinking [...] "milk and honey", which are [...] "markers par excellence of utopian golden times" [...] under the divine authority of Bona Dea.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "quality and {{consistency}} of the KV57 dockets strongly suggest that Horemheb was buried in his Year 14, or at least before the wine harvest of his Year 15 at the very latest." [...] This evidence is consistent [...] "with the Horemheb dockets from Deir el-Medina which mention Years 2, 3, 4, 6, 13 and 14, but again no higher dates"... while a docket ascribed to Horemheb from Sedment has Year 12." [...] The lack of dated inscriptions for Horemheb after his Year 14 also explains the unfinished state of Horemheb's royal KV57 tomb--"a fact not taken into account by any of those [...] defending a long reign [...] The tomb is {{comparable to that of}} Seti I in size and decoration technique, and Seti I's tomb is far more extensively decorated than that of Horemheb, and yet Seti managed to virtually complete his tomb within a decade, whereas Horemheb did not even succeed in fully decorating the three rooms he planned to have done, leaving even the burial hall unfinished. Even if we assume that Horemheb did not begin the work on his royal tomb until his Year 7 or 8, ... it remains a mystery how the work could not have been completed had he lived on for another 20 or more years." [...] Therefore, Horemheb's reign has been determined and accepted today by most scholars to be 14 years and 1 month—Manetho had assigned him a reign of 4 years in his Epitome and 1 month—based on the clear evidence of the <b>wine</b> <b>jar</b> labels and the lack of dates beyond his Year 14 but this figure should be raised by a decade. As for the Year 27 hieratic graffito at Horemheb's Funerary temple at Medinet Habu and the Year 59 date from the inscription of Mes, Van Dijk argues that the first date likely inaugurated a statue of Horemheb during Year 27 of Ramesses II or III in Horemheb's temple while the latter date of Mes [...] "can hardly be taken seriously, and indeed is not taken at face value by even the staunchest supporters of a long reign" [...] for Horemheb since there was no standard Egyptian practise of including the years of all the rulers between Amenhotep III and Horemheb as Wolfgang Helck makes clear.|$|E

5000|$|In 2011, Jacobus van Dijk {{questioned}} the [...] "Year 11" [...] stated on the Gebel Barkal stela.

In a 2012 paper, David Aston analyzed the <b>wine</b> <b>jars</b> and came to the same conclusion since no wine labels higher than his 8th regnal year were found in his tomb.|$|R

The entrance ramp leads 25 metres deep into three galleries heading East-West, extending into a maze-like system of doorways, vestibules and corridors. The Deutsches Archäologisches Institut (DAI) accomplished five excavations and found out, that Nynetjer's tomb shows great architectural similarities to the Gallery Tomb B, which {{is thought to be}} either Raneb's or Hotepsekhemwy's burial site. This led the DAI to the conclusion that Nynetjer was inspired by his predecessor's tombs. 56 flint knives, 44 razors, 44 further blades and <b>wine</b> and beer <b>jars</b> were found. The southern gallery surprisingly was nearly undisturbed and contained lots of royal objects surviving from Nynetjer's lifetime, such as more than 50 sealed <b>wine</b> <b>jars,</b> carrying nets, storage boxes made of wood and decorated alabaster bottles.
