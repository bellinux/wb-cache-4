5|$|With this knowledge, {{and a more}} {{accurate}} Smeaton number, the Wrights designed their 1902 glider. Using another crucial discovery from the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel,</b> they made the airfoil flatter, reducing the camber (the depth of the wing's curvature divided by its chord). The 1901 wings had significantly greater curvature, a highly inefficient feature the Wrights copied directly from Lilienthal. Fully confident in their new <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> results, the Wrights discarded Lilienthal's data, now basing their designs on their own calculations.|$|E
40|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> are an {{important}} tool in the aero-acoustic development of ground and air vehicles: for investigation of noise sources and characterization of interior and exterior noise environment associated with external flow aerodynamics. Recent trends in new aero-acoustic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels,</b> upgraded aerodynamic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels,</b> and climatic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> are presented in terms of innovation to serve as aero-acoustic tools for the vehicle designer. 2. THE NEED Prototype ground vehicles, especially automobiles, require large <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{for the development of}} quiet vehicles, and for comparative testing against competitor’s models. High speed vehicles such as trains and aircraft are tested in smaller <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> using scale models, primarily due to capital and operating costs of large high speed <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{needs for}} {{validation}} of CFD codes {{to be applied}} to the aerothermodynamic problems of the Hermes reentry flight has made the development of new high enthalpy <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> like F 4 at ONERA and HEG at DLR necessary. Due to the demand for high enthalpy conditions,specific features of the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> have {{to be taken into account}} and hence conventional instrumentation known from continiously running <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> and "cold" hypersonic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> are generallynot applicable...|$|R
50|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> can {{be divided}} into two categories: continuous-{{operating}} and intermittent-operating <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels.</b> Continuous operating supersonic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> require an independent electrical power source that drastically increases with the size of the test section. Intermittent supersonic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> are less expensive in that they store electrical energy {{over an extended period of}} time, then discharge the energy over a series of brief tests. The difference between these two is analogous to the comparison between a battery and a capacitor.|$|R
5|$|In September 1969, Cheyenne {{prototype}} #10 (s/n 66-8835) underwent <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{testing at}} NASA Ames Research Center, {{to research the}} half-P hop and drag issues. The engineers {{did not realize that}} the fixed mounts used to secure the aircraft in the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> would not allow the helicopter to move relative to the rotor, as it did in flight. As a result, there was no natural damping of the rotor pitching motion. The remote controllers' lack of sensory feedback from helicopter compounded the situation. During high speed testing to replicate the half-P hop vibration, the rotor oscillations quickly accelerated out of control and struck the tail boom, resulting in the destructive breakup of the helicopter.|$|E

5|$|During the {{shooting}} in the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> Craig and Kurylenko wore wind-resistant contact lenses that enabled them to open their eyes as they fell. For safety and comfort, they only shot for 30 seconds at a time. Forster wished he {{had more time to}} work on the free-fall scene.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> widely used at {{hypersonic}} velocities, are impulse and high-enthalpy facilities. These tunnels are based on different operation principles [1 ÷ 5, 14]: Blowdown <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> several seconds; Ludwieg tubes up to 500 ms; Hotshot <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> up to 150 ms; Adiabatic compression <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> up to 100 ms; Shock tubes up to 10 ms; Shock tubes with a heavy piston up to 2 ms. Because of the short test time in these facilities, it is necessary to estimate the time...|$|R
50|$|Outdoor {{vertical}} <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{can either}} be portable or stationary. Portable vertical <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> are often used in movies and demonstrations, and are often rented for large events such as conventions and state fairs. Portable units offer a dramatic effect for the flying person and the spectators, {{because there are no}} walls around the flight area. These vertical <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> allow people to fly with a full or partial outdoor/sky view. Outdoor vertical <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> may also have walls or netting around the wind column, to keep beginner tunnel flyers from falling out of the tunnel.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of cryogenic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> is reviewed and 13 cryogenic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> currently operating in England, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.

A table illustrating {{the characteristics of}} these tunnels is presented, including test gases, test section sizes, speed ranges, stagnation pressure and temperature, and running time. The research conducted using the various <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> is outlined and the operation {{of each of the}} tunnels is considered...|$|R
5|$|GE and SNECMA {{also tested}} the {{effectiveness}} of chevrons on reducing jet noise. After examining configurations in the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel,</b> CFMI chose to flight-test chevrons built into the core exhaust nozzle. The chevrons reduced jet noise by 1.3 perceived loudness decibels during takeoff conditions, and are now offered as an option with the CFM56 for the Airbus A321.|$|E
5|$|The Development Bank of Latin America has {{awarded a}} grant to RSMAS to conduct a {{feasibility}} study for a new experimental water tunnel facility located in Panama.

5|$|The casing {{was tested}} in a <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and {{retained}} after it {{was found to be}} as good as other forms of streamlining. After introduction it was subsequently found that its aerodynamic form failed to disturb the air sufficiently to lift the exhaust from the chimney, thus obstructing the driver's vision with smoke.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of cryogenic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> is reviewed {{with reference to}} the theory and advantages of cryogenic tunnels, problems common to <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> and their solution, and application of cryogenic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> to high Reynolds number testing. It is shown that cryogenic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> can achieve full-scale Reynolds number with reasonable tunnel size, dynamic pressure, and drive power; the use of such tunnels also makes it possible to separate the effects of Reynolds number, Mach number, and aeroelasticity. Application of the cryogenic tunnel concept is illustrated by three examples, namely an atmospheric low-speed cryogenic tunnel, a 0. 3 -meter transonic cryogenic tunnel, and the National Transonic Facility now nearing completion...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the past}} 10 years {{there have been}} placed in {{operation}} in the United States four low-turbulence <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> of moderate cross-sectional area and speed, one at the National Bureau of Standards, two at the NACA Langley Laboratory, and one at the NACA Ames Laboratory. This paper reviews briefly the state of knowledge and those features which make possible the attainment of low turbulence in <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels.</b> Specific applications to two <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> are described...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{vertical}} <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{have been}} built for aerodynamic research, the most high-profile are those used as recreational <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels,</b> frequently advertised as [...] "indoor skydiving" [...] or bodyflight, which have also become a popular training tool for skydivers.|$|R
5|$|With {{characteristic}} caution, {{the brothers}} first flew the 1902 glider as an unmanned kite, {{as they had}} done with their two previous versions. Rewarding their <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> work, the glider produced the expected lift. It also had a new structural feature: a fixed, rear vertical rudder, which the brothers hoped would eliminate turning problems.|$|E
5|$|As in {{many other}} insects, the lift {{generated}} by butterflies is more than can {{be accounted for by}} steady-state, non-transitory aerodynamics. Studies using Vanessa atalanta in a <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> show that they use a wide variety of aerodynamic mechanisms to generate force. These include wake capture, vortices at the wing edge, rotational mechanisms and the Weis-Fogh 'clap-and-fling' mechanism. Butterflies are able to change from one mode to another rapidly.|$|E
5|$|As the P.1127 {{had been}} {{developed}} {{at a time of}} deep UK defense cuts, Hawker had to seek commercial funding, and significant engine development funding came from the U.S. Research assistance was also provided by U.S.; including a series of <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> tests conducted by NASA's Langley Research Center using sub-scale models, which demonstrated acceptable flight characteristics. Hawker test pilot Hugh Merewether went to the U.S. at NASA's request to fly the Bell X-14. In March 1959, the company's board of directors (Hawker Siddeley then) decided to privately fund two P.1127 prototypes.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of Fuzzy Logic Controllers (FLC's) {{to the control}} of nonlinear processes, typically controlled by a human operator, is a topic of much study. Recent {{application of}} a microprocessor-based FLC to the control of temperature processes in several <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{has proven to be}} very successful. The control of temperature processes in the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> requires the ability to monitor temperature feedback from several points and to accommodate varying operating conditions in the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The FLC has an intuitive and easily configurable structure which incorporates the flexibility required to have such an ability. The design and implementation of the FLC is presented along with process data from the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> under automatic control...|$|R

5|$|Before the {{detailed}} <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> tests Wilbur traveled to Chicago at Chanute's invitation {{to give a}} lecture to the Western Society of Engineers on September 18, 1901. He presented a thorough report about the 1900–01 glider experiments and complemented his talk with a lantern slide show of photographs. Wilbur's speech was the first public account of the brothers' experiments. A report {{was published in the}} Journal of the society, which was then separately published as an offprint titled Some Aeronautical Experiments in a 300 copy edition.|$|E
5|$|Both {{models were}} plagued from the onset by inefficient engines, but {{were capable of}} the short-distance {{takeoffs}} required by the Swiss (330meters for the P–16, 232meters for the N-20). After <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> and engine tests, but before the N–20 could make its maiden flight, Federal Councillor Karl Kobelt cancelled the N-20project in 1953, leading to much resentment of the government by Emmen engineers when the FFA project was continued. Eventually, neither of the aircraft came into production, although {{the wings of the}} P-16 were later used {{in the development of the}} successful Learjet.|$|E
5|$|Its design {{began in}} September 2005 with {{sketches}} by Jason Castriota moving through computer aided sculpture and stringent <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> testing. More than 200 components were designed {{especially for the}} car. Most components, including the engine, drivetrain, are modified from the original Enzo Ferrari. The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is unchanged from the Enzo from which it was derived. The P4/5 was publicly revealed on August 18, 2006 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elégance and shown again at the Paris Motor Show in late September.|$|E
40|$|Future {{generations of}} {{aircraft}} {{will be developed}} applying “High Reynolds Number Design”, using advanced computational aerodynamics and industry-scale cryogenic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> which enable aerodynamic optimization tests for flight Reynolds numbers on scaled models. For validation purposes and to further improve the computational techniques, accurate aerodynamic field-data must be supplied during the design process including transition locations, surface pressure distributions, velocity fields and acoustic field data. Thus, modern image based measurement techniques commonly used in “warm” industrial <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{have to be made}} also available for productive testing in cryogenic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels...</b>|$|R
50|$|High subsonic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> (0.4 < M < 0.75) and {{transonic}} <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> (0.75 < M < 1.2) {{are designed}} {{on the same}} principles as the subsonic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels.</b> The highest speed is reached in the test section. The Mach number is approximately 1 with combined subsonic and supersonic flow regions. Testing at transonic speeds presents additional problems, mainly due to {{the reflection of the}} shock waves from the walls of the test section (see figure below or enlarge the thumb picture at the right). Therefore, perforated or slotted walls are required to reduce shock reflection from the walls. Since important viscous or inviscid interactions occur (such as shock waves or boundary layer interaction) both Mach and Reynolds number are important and must be properly simulated.Large-scale facilities and/or pressurized or cryogenic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> are used.|$|R
40|$|Progress in {{developing}} fiber-optic interferometric sensors for aeroacoustic measurements in <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels,</b> performed under the NASA program, is reported.

5|$|Situated {{behind the}} leading edge of the wing the engine intake had wing {{boundary}} layer ahead of it. Two thirds was diverted and the remaining third which entered the intake did not adversely affect the intake efficiency except during pushovers when the boundary layer thickened ahead of the intake and caused surging. Extensive <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> testing helped define leading edge modifications ahead of the intakes which solved the problem.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{came back}} to West Point in July 1937 as an {{instructor}} in the Department of Natural and Experimental Philosophy, as the Science Department was then known. He was promoted to captain on 9 July 1938. From May to August 1939, he attended the Air Corps Tactical School, after which he returned to West Point as an assistant professor. While there he built a <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and wrote a book, entitled Preliminary Airplane Design, {{which was published in}} 1941.|$|E
5|$|A {{full-scale}} mockup of the Q-12 {{was ready}} by 7 December 1962, {{and had already}} undergone preliminary tests to measure its radar cross-section. Marquardt had also successfully tested the modified RJ-43 in its <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> in the meantime. However, the CIA was not enthusiastic about the Q-12, mostly because the agency was overextended at the time with U-2 missions, getting the A-12 up to speed, and covert operations in Southeast Asia. The Air Force, however, {{was interested in the}} Q-12 as both a reconnaissance platform and a cruise missile, and the CIA finally decided to work with the USAF to develop the new drone. Lockheed was awarded a contract in March 1963 for full-scale development of the Q-12.|$|E

40|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> allow {{researchers}} to investigate animals' flight under controlled conditions, and provide {{easy access to}} the animals during flight. These increasingly popular devices can benefit integrative migration biology by allowing us to explore the links between aerodynamic theory and migration as well as the links between flight behavior and physiology. Currently, <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> are being used to investigate many different migratory phenomena, including the relationship between metabolic power and flight speed and carry-over effects between different seasons. Although biotelemetry is also becoming increasingly common, it is unlikely that {{it will be able to}} completely supplant <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> because of the difficulty of measuring or varying parameters such as flight speed or temperature in the wild. <b>Wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> and swim tunnels will therefore continue to be important tools we can use for studying integrative migration biology...|$|R
40|$|The wall {{interference}} assessment/correction code presented is nonlinear, involves four walls, and {{is applicable}} to transonic airfoil data from <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> with shaped, solid {{top and bottom}} walls.
