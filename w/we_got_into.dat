Lashly wrote: [...] "I cannot describe the maze <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> and the hairbreadth escapes {{we have had to}} pass through." [...] In his attempts to find the way down, Evans removed his goggles and subsequently suffered agonies of snow blindness that made him into a passenger.|$|E
500|$|On 18 October, The Sun {{reported}} that McGuire {{had left the}} band. At a reception when Ayers Rock returned to Australia, he said: [...] "The pressure of the tour was just too much. We {{were on the road}} all the time and I guess I wasn't as strong {{as the rest of the}} band. When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> the studio I had the shakes. I mean I was playing the right notes, but not in the right places." [...] To finish the album McGuire's friend Les Young played some of the bass guitar parts, and American Jeff Castleman played bass on [...] "Catchanemu". Young also briefly played live with Ayers Rock in Australia, including an October 1975 show at the State Theatre in Sydney. McGuire returned to the group at the Dallas Brooks Hall on 21 October 1975, to warm applause.|$|E
500|$|Iowa was {{recorded}} and produced at Sound City and Sound Image studios in Los Angeles, California with producer Ross Robinson, who had produced their debut album. Drummer Joey Jordison and bassist Paul Gray {{began working on}} new music together in October 2000 and together they wrote material {{for most of the}} tracks on the album. During this time other band members wanted a break following the extensive touring which followed their self-titled debut album. However, on January 17, 2001, Slipknot entered the studio to begin recording Iowa. This period in the band's career has become known as one of their worst for several reasons. Jordison stated retrospectively, [...] "that's where <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> a war" [...] citing the lack of a break for himself and Gray, while other factors, including vocalist Corey Taylor's alcohol addiction, several other members' drug addictions, management issues and more, affected relations in the band.|$|E

500|$|As Petrucci and Rudess {{felt that}} the album needed real string lines and choirs, {{as well as other}} organic sounds, they enlisted the help of veteran {{composer}} David Campbell to assist with aspects of the orchestration and handle the logistics of recording all of the necessary musicians. Reflecting on the process for Keyboard, Rudess explained, [...] "Our initial thought was, let’s do it all on rock instruments and let David arrange it, but that wasn’t really thinking ahead in terms of who we are. When we go into the studio, we tend to work on things until they’re pretty polished. So <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> what we called pre-orchestrating. I’d use any sound at my disposal to place strings where we wanted to hear strings, choir where we wanted choir, and so forth—but without getting overly specific about a certain patch or instrument library being the one, because we knew it was all going to be replaced with real players." [...] Once the album's arrangements were complete, they were performed and recorded in studios around the world, with Campbell conducting and leading the sessions from Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|In the lockout-shortened 2012–13 NHL season, both goaltenders {{split the}} playing duties {{although}} Schneider {{was the number}} one goalie. Luongo handled his demotion with class and remained supportive of Schneider, soon calling the Canucks [...] "Cory's team." [...] Head coach Alain Vigneault said [...] "Cory is our MVP and one of reasons why <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> playoffs. I've {{got a lot of}} faith in him and that's why we're going with him". In the opening playoff round facing the San Jose Sharks, as Schneider had been injured {{near the end of the}} regular season, Luongo started the first two games and played well but his team lost both. Luongo came off the bench in game three after Schneider was pulled in the third period. Luongo was the backup in game four as the Canucks lost in overtime, ending his team's postseason in four straight games. Luongo put his penthouse up for sale, as it was accepted that he had played his final game as a Canuck. Although he had nine years left on a 12-year, $64-million contract, which represented a $5.33 million salary cap hit, general manager Mike Gillis remained confident of making a deal in the summer.|$|E
500|$|The Kurt–Blaine relationship, {{sometimes}} referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Klaine" [...] by Glee fans and the media, developed slowly. As the series showrunner, Murphy felt tasked with keeping the two apart as long as possible. He was initially unsure whether the relationship would become a romantic one, and intended to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, [...] "Part of me thinks he should be the boyfriend, part of me thinks he should just be the mentor. I didn't want to decide that until <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> sort of {{the middle of the}} season." [...] In December 2010, Colfer said, [...] "Fans really want it to happen. It's funny how many people want to see these boys hook up. We'll see." [...] Based on the characters' chemistry and the [...] "immediate outcry" [...] from fans who wanted to see them as a couple, Murphy decided to have Blaine become Kurt's love interest. Criss noted: [...] "We all want to see Kurt happy, and like all great love stories, if you have two people that can be together you've got to hold it up." ...|$|E

500|$|Bear McCreary {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} compose music for the series in July 2013. Unlike on some of his previous scores, ABC and Marvel allowed McCreary {{to work with a}} full symphonic orchestra, typically featuring 50 or 70 players, with over 90 for [...] "important" [...] episodes. Complex synthesizer programming was also used, to give the score [...] "a modern edge". Since Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was the first MCU television series, McCreary felt there was [...] "a sense that it had to connect" [...] to the consistent orchestra sound of the films, but viewed through a television lens. McCreary composes on average 30 minutes of music per episode. Creating the main theme for the series, which McCreary also saw as Coulson's theme, was a process which took a lot of collaboration with the executive producers, who wanted a specific sound—"something big, that...belonged in the Marvel Cinematic Universe" [...] but also [...] "intimate because these aren't superheroes, these are regular people." [...] McCreary had to work harder to make the theme heard, given that the show does not have a traditional title sequence. By the third and fourth seasons, McCreary noted [...] "the score became a little more intense and more electronically driven... lectronics really moved to the forefront as <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> more stories about Inhumans and the digital world our characters inhabit. But the orchestra is always our foundation." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{production}} {{on the second}} season began, Murphy confirmed that Kurt would be paired with a new romantic interest. According to Chord Overstreet, his character Sam Evans was originally intended to become Kurt's love interest. However, Sam's storyline was later adjusted to pair him with glee club member Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) after producers observed the chemistry between Overstreet and Agron. Kurt was subsequently paired with another new character, Blaine Anderson, {{a member of the}} rival show choir group the Dalton Academy Warblers, who is initially a mentor for Kurt. Murphy was unsure at first whether their relationship would become a romantic one, and stated that he wished to gauge public response to their friendship before planning future developments. He commented, [...] "Part of me thinks he should be the boyfriend, part of me thinks he should just be the mentor. I didn't want to decide that until <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> sort of the middle of the season." [...] Kurt transfers from McKinley High to Dalton Academy and falls in love with Blaine, though Blaine only considers him a close friend. However, when Kurt sings the Beatles song [...] "Blackbird" [...] in [...] "Original Song", Blaine finally realizes his true feelings and the two kiss, marking the start of the relationship. Criss noted, [...] "We all want to see Kurt happy, and like all great love stories, if you have two people that can be together you've got to hold it up." [...] When imagining Blaine and Kurt's potential future together, Murphy expected to treat them the same as all other Glee relationships by making their pairing [...] "as flawed and as exposed as everyone else's." [...] This plan was confirmed by Falchuk after the characters kissed for the first time, though he later clarified: [...] "They're solid. They have problems—you have two stars dating each other, there's going to be some competition there." [...] In the second-season finale, they each tell the other, [...] "I love you", and early in the third season they decide to have sex for the first time. The Kurt–Blaine relationship has been well received by critics, and they were named [...] "one of the most beloved TV couples of the millennium" [...] late in the second season by Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{band members}} have also spoken about the {{contributions}} of Dickinson and MacDougall. [...] "Sometimes when new people come in it brings so many positive changes", said Rich.

2500|$|Public {{perception}} is that the Iraqis were confrontational and blocking {{the work of the}} inspectors. In 98% of the inspections, the Iraqis did everything we asked them to because it dealt with disarmament. However when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> issues of sensitivity, such as coming close to presidential security installations, Iraqis raised a flag and said, [...] "Time out. We got a C.I.A. out there that's trying to kill our president and we're not very happy about giving you access to the most sensitive installations and the most sensitive personalities in Iraq." [...] So we had these modalities, where we agreed that if we came to a site and the Iraqis called it 'sensitive,' we go in with four people.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the period}} of filming, Murray {{was in the midst}} of marital {{problems}} and several crew reported his attitude as erratic. Murray had wanted to make the film less of a comedy as to make it more contemplative, against Ramis' own direction to keep it as a comedy. Rather than to handle Murray's constant phone calls, Ramis had Murray work with Rubin in New York City directly to adjust the script to satisfy Murray's requests. Actor Stephen Tobolowsky described the script changes: [...] "When I got the part, it was still kind of a mediocre Bill Murray movie," [...] he said. [...] "You know, Bill Murray, with no consequences, in comic situations ... It wasn’t until <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> the shooting that everything turned on its head. And it became not only a good movie, not only a great movie, but a classic." ...|$|E

I was the only one at the time that could drive. I used to have to drive the bloody van and get them up at quarter to nine every morning; which was, believe me, early for us then. I said to them, [...] "This is how we have got to do it because this is how Jethro Tull did it." [...] They had a schedule and they knew that they were going to work from this time till that time.

2500|$|The {{track was}} {{produced}} by Wilson, who intended to encapsulate {{the feel of the}} Drifters' version of [...] "On Broadway". The instrumental was made on April 6, 1965 at United Western Recorders, requiring 44 takes before Wilson could deem a satisfactory performance. Problems had arisen from the tempo and guitar part in the introduction, which fatigued Wilson, engineer Chuck Britz, and the dozen-plus session players. The song did not appear to have lyrics or a title at this juncture, and Wilson can be heard calling the song [...] "Oh Yeah" [...] and [...] "You're Grass and I'm a Power Mower". Wilson remembers: [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>into</b> the studio with Chuck, he said that he wanted Carl’s twelve-string guitar in the intro to sound more direct. I didn’t know what that meant. 'Can he play it in the booth?' Chuck said. I had never thought about that before, but {{it seemed like a good}} idea. Carl was standing next to me in the booth and all the other musicians were out in the studio. I conducted it like an orchestra." ...|$|E
