5|$|Ibuki's build is {{depicted}} as slim and athletic, with black hair held tightly back in a topknot ponytail that drops well beneath her waist.

Her footwear consists only of cloth bandages <b>wrapped</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> shins, ankles and instep.

One of her scrapped costume concepts for Super Street Fighter IV was a very distinct, partially armored ninja outfit, which was more skimpy and featured two Japanese swords on her back.|$|E
