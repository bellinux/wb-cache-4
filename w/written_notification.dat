25|$|Francis M. Walker's men, which {{included}} his 19th Tennessee Infantry {{as well as}} Maney's old brigade, had not been engaged that day since they had been marched and countermarched almost back to their original position. Cleburne placed Walker's brigade on the left front of the attacking force. The attack was launched with about 3,500 men in total, with 2,000 more in a second wave, at about 6:00p.m. Cleburne himself led the attack with Walker's brigade. The Union force had about half {{the number of men}} but they were behind their defenses. Emerging from a stand of woods, Walker's men were hard hit and began to retreat before Cleburne and Maney rallied them. Then they moved with a two-sided assault with troops to their right toward the Union line. Despite taking about 100 casualties in their previous advances, Walker's men followed Walker, who was waving his sword in encouragement, toward the crest of the hill. As they reached the crest, Walker's brigade was hit with a tremendous volley from defenders over the crest. Walker was killed by that volley. He had been appointed a brigadier general the previous day but he had not yet received <b>written</b> <b>notification</b> of his appointment. Walker's commission arrived at his headquarters the day after he was killed. After Walker's death, many of his men diverted to another point of attack to try to take a Union battery and suffered severe casualties. As night fell, the Confederates could not continue the attack and the Union troops held their fort {{at the top of the}} hill. The Confederates had sustained over 600 casualties while the Union defenders had endured about 550 casualties in the Battle of Bald Hill, which was but a small part of the overall Battle of Atlanta.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of patient compliance on a program of watchful waiting in cases of small abdominal aortic aneurysms and to document the proportion of patients who become prohibitive operative risks during follow-up. Study Design: A retrospective review was conducted at a regional military veterans medical center. The subjects were 101 male military veterans with abdominal aortic aneurysms measuring less than 5 cm who did not have medical contraindications to operative repair. The main outcome measures were (1) the proportion of patients who missed three scheduled radiologic tests in a row despite <b>written</b> <b>notifications</b> mailed to their homes and (2) the proportion of compliant patients who had medical illnesses and became prohibitive operative risks during follow-up. Results: During a follow-up (mean ± SEM) of 34 ± 2 months, 69 patients (69 %) were fully compliant with the watchful waiting program and underwent a mean of 4. 5 ± 0. 3 radiologic tests. There were no abdominal aortic aneurysm ruptures in this subgroup. Twenty-five patients (36 %) had indications for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and 28 (41 %) have not met the criteria for repair. Sixteen (23 %) of the 69 compliant patients developed prohibitive medical risks during follow-up; eight (50 %) of these 16 patients died, all of the causes unrelated to their abdominal aortic aneurysms. Thirty-two (32 %) of the 101 study subjects were noncompliant with the watchful waiting program. Twenty-seven (84 %) of the noncompliant patients did not keep any scheduled appointments, and five (16 %) were lost after one or two examinations. Three of the noncompliant patients experienced documented abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture, and it is suspected in a fourth. Direct contact was made with 28 (88 %) of these patients or their families; all acknowledged having received <b>written</b> <b>notifications</b> regarding their watchful waiting program tests and had decided not to continue with surveillance for a variety of socioeconomic reasons. Between the 69 compliant patients and the 32 noncompliant patients, there were no differences with respect to mean age (70 ± 1 years vs 73 ± 2 years), distance from home of record to the hospital (62 ± 14 miles vs 73 ± 23 miles), or abdominal aortic aneurysm size at initial detection (3. 75 ± 0. 5 cm vs 3. 8 ± 0. 5 cm). Conclusions: Watchful waiting programs are imperfect and highly reliant on the motivation levels and means of the individual patients. Watchful waiting is reasonable among compliant patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms, inasmuch as fewer than half will meet the criteria for intervention within a mean of 3 years. Approximately one fourth of these patients will have medical contraindications to abdominal aortic aneurysm repair during follow-up, and many of these will die of causes other than abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture. In our experience, one third of candidates for watchful waiting programs are unable to participate and are at risk of rupture. These patients need special attention so that the reasons for their noncompliance can be determined, and they may be candidates for earlier intervention. (J Vasc Surg 2000; 32 : 441 - 50. ...|$|R

50|$|Under the New York Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights, a {{domestic}} worker {{is defined as}} someone who works in another person's home who {{is not related to}} them and is not a part-time job. This bill gives domestic workers an eight-hour work day and overtime (time and a half) for working over 40 hours a week (or 44 hours if the employee resides in the home of their employer). This law also establishes that workers must be granted one day (24 hours) off every seven days of work or be paid overtime pay if the employee agrees to work on this day. Also, after one year of work with the same employer, domestic workers are granted three paid days off every year. Although domestic workers were already covered by the minimum wage law, this bill ensures that domestic workers receive $7.25 per hour. Employers must pay their workers weekly and cannot deduct money from the employee's paycheck without written permission. Employers must now keep a payroll and provide workers with <b>written</b> <b>notifications</b> regarding sick days, vacation days, and work schedules. Domestic workers who work at least 40 hours a week are now entitled to Workers' Compensation Insurance and Disability Benefits. This law also gives domestic workers coverage under the New York State Human Rights Law if they have been harassed due to gender, race, sex, religion, or origin. The employer cannot make any unwanted sexual advances including both physical and verbal sexual actions. If the worker files a complaint, the employer cannot retaliate. This law covers all full-time workers, including immigrants. This law does not cover people who are related to the person they care for, or if they are a part-time worker, such as a baby-sitter.|$|R
