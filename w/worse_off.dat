5|$|During the 1995 {{legislative}} campaign, Ryzhkov {{defended his}} own tenure as Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, claiming that Russians were far <b>worse</b> <b>off</b> under capitalism than Soviet communism. Russian TV channel NTV broadcast a debate featuring only Ryzhkov and Grigory Yavlinsky, a liberal politician who strongly supported economic reforms. At the election, {{he was elected}} to the State Duma Federal Assembly as an independent candidate. Once elected, he headed the Power to the People bloc, a communist faction with nationalist tendencies. The Power to the People bloc came about through the merger of Ryzhkov's supporters and the All-People's Union headed by Sergey Baburin. Its policies were left-wing and included revival of the Soviet Union, the introduction of a planned economy, more state involvement in the economy and the promotion of nationalism and patriotism. During the 1996 presidential election Ryzhkov endorsed Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) candidate, for the presidency.|$|E
5|$|In America, {{he again}} tried {{his hand at}} journalism, but a brief stint {{as editor of the}} New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung {{resulted}} only in getting the paper suspended and landing himself a rather large fine. On March 31, 1905, he recited poetry at a benefit performance at Cooper Union to raise a pension for Yiddish poet Eliakum Zunser, even <b>worse</b> <b>off</b> than himself because he had found himself unable to write since coming to America in 1889. Shortly afterwards, he met a group of young people who had a Hebrew language association at the Dr. Herzl Zion Club, and wrote a Hebrew-language play David ba-Milchama (David in the War), which they performed in March 1906, the first Hebrew-language play to be performed in America. Repeat performances in March 1907 and April 1908 drew successively larger crowds.|$|E
5|$|Joseph's {{reforms were}} deeply unpopular within the Austrian Netherlands. The Enlightenment had made few inroads into the territory, {{and it was}} widely distrusted as a foreign {{phenomenon}} which was not compatible with traditional local values. The majority of the population, especially influenced by the Church, believed the reforms {{to be a threat}} to their own cultures and traditions which would leave them <b>worse</b> <b>off.</b> Even in pro-Enlightenment circles, the reforms caused discontent which were seen as not sufficiently radical and not far reaching enough. Popular opposition was centered on the provincial states, in particular Hainaut, Brabant and Flanders, as well as their law courts. There was a wave of critical pamphleting. In some towns, riots broke out and the militia had to be called to suppress them. The Estate of Brabant called a lawyer, Hendrik Van der Noot, to defend their position publicly. Van der Noot publicly accused the reforms of violating the precedents established by the Joyous Entry of 1356 which was widely regarded as a traditional bill of rights for the region.|$|E

5|$|In September 1944, McGovern {{joined the}} 741st Squadron of the 455th Bombardment Group of the Fifteenth Air Force, {{stationed}} at San Giovanni Airfield near Cerignola in the Apulia region of Italy. There {{he and his}} crew found a starving, disease-ridden local population wracked by the ill fortunes of war and far <b>worse</b> <b>off</b> than anything they had seen back home during the Depression. Those sights would form part of his later motivation to fight hunger. Starting on November 11, 1944, McGovern flew 35missions over enemy territory from San Giovanni, the first five as co-pilot for an experienced crew and the rest as pilot for his own plane, known as the Dakota Queen after his wife Eleanor. His targets were in Austria; Czechoslovakia; Nazi Germany; Hungary; Poland; and northern, German-controlled Italy, and were often either oil refinery complexes or rail marshalling yards, all {{as part of the}} U.S.strategic bombing campaign in Europe. The eight- or nine-hour missions were grueling tests of endurance for pilots and crew, and while German fighter aircraft were a diminished threat by this time as compared to earlier in the war, his missions often faced heavy anti-aircraft artillery fire that filled the sky with flak bursts.|$|E
5|$|Shapiro {{responds}} to Goodin's argument by challenging his factual assumption that individuals would starve if they refused the workfare throffer. In state-sponsored (see welfare state) workfare systems, he claims, only monetary assistance is eliminated by {{a refusal to}} accept the throffer, while in private systems (that is, non-state charities or organisations offering conditional aid), other groups than the one operating a workfare system exist. In either system, recipients of welfare may also turn {{to family and friends}} for help. For these reasons, he does not consider the throffer to be unrefusable in the cases in which Goodin believes it is. A second (and, Shapiro claims, more important) objection is also presented. State welfare without sanctions fails to mirror the way that working individuals who do not rely on welfare payments take responsibility for their lives. If a person who works stops working, Shapiro observes, then they will typically find their economic situation worsened. Unconditional state welfare does not reflect this, and instead reflects the unusual position of the person who would be no <b>worse</b> <b>off</b> if they refused to work. As unconditional welfare does not mirror the situation of ordinary workers, it is unable {{to determine whether or not}} people are willing to take responsibility for their lives.|$|E
25|$|A {{reallocation}} {{is said to}} be a Pareto improvement if {{at least}} one person is made better off and nobody is made <b>worse</b> <b>off.</b> However in practice, it is almost impossible to take any social action, such as a change in economic policy, without making at least one person <b>worse</b> <b>off.</b> Even voluntary exchanges may not be Pareto improving if they make third parties <b>worse</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

25|$|Using the {{criterion}} for Kaldor–Hicks improvement, an outcome is an improvement if those that are made better off could in principle compensate those that are made <b>worse</b> <b>off,</b> so that a Pareto improving outcome could (though does not have to) be achieved. For example, a voluntary exchange that creates pollution would be a Kaldor–Hicks improvement if the buyers and sellers are still willing {{to carry out the}} transaction even if they have to fully compensate the victims of the pollution. Kaldor–Hicks does not require compensation actually be paid, merely that the possibility for compensation exists, and thus need not leave each at least as well off. Under Kaldor–Hicks efficiency, an improvement can in fact leave some people <b>worse</b> <b>off.</b> Pareto-improvements require making every party involved better off (or at least no <b>worse</b> <b>off).</b>|$|E

25|$|A Kaldor–Hicks improvement, {{named for}} Nicholas Kaldor and John Hicks, {{also known as}} the Kaldor–Hicks criterion, is a way of judging {{economic}} re-allocations of resources among people that captures some of the intuitive appeal of Pareto efficiencies, but has less stringent criteria and is hence applicable to more circumstances. A re-allocation is a Kaldor–Hicks improvement if those that are made better off could hypothetically compensate those that are made <b>worse</b> <b>off</b> and lead to a Pareto-improving outcome. The compensation does not actually have to occur (there is no presumption in favor of status-quo) and thus, a Kaldor–Hicks improvement can in fact leave some people <b>worse</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} the facial pattern in orofacial functions (OFFs) and quality of life (QoL), and their relationship in individuals with dentofacial deformities (DFD). METHODS: As approved by the Research Ethics Committee, 36 subjects, aged between 18 and 40 years, divided into three groups of seven female and five male participants, i. e., facial pattern I (n= 12), pattern II (n= 12) and pattern III (n= 12), participated in this study. The OFFs were assessed using the MBGR protocol and QoL by the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP- 14) questionnaire. Comparisons between OFFs and facial patterns were made using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the correlation between the facial pattern and QoL by means of Spearman's test, considering a 5 % significance level. RESULTS: A significant difference (p< 0. 05) was observed when comparing patterns I and II, and patterns I and III, with no difference between patterns II and III, neither in the OHIP- 14 nor in the MBGR. A significant linear correlation (r= 0. 666; p< 0. 05) was verified between the MBGR and the OHIP- 14, showing that the <b>worse</b> the <b>OFFs,</b> the <b>worse</b> the QoL. CONCLUSION: The facial pattern influenced the performance of the OFFs and the QoL in individuals presenting DFD, with a greater occurrence of changes for patterns II and III, and the <b>worse</b> the <b>OFFs,</b> the <b>worse</b> the QoL in cases with DFD...|$|R
40|$|The populace in {{developing}} countries be it better or <b>worse</b> <b>offs</b> are exposed {{to a variety of}} risks like illness, disability, death, unemployment, or crime vulnerable to become poor. Low income households, however, are less able to prevent and mitigate risks and so they are less able to cope with the consequences. The developmental role of conventional insurance service any nation is pivotal. This is because economic development focuses attention upon the development and use of recourses to increase supply and improve the distribution of economic goods. However, in Nigeria where there is low insurance patronage and instead {{the vast majority of the}} citizen are exposed variants types of risk. The resulting effects are poverty, economic insecurity, insurgency, and social vices. Micro-insurance is considered as one of the most effective means of reducing the vulnerability of the poor from the impacts of disease, theft, violence, disability, fire and other hazards. This method of insurance can protects against unexpected losses by pooling the resources of the many to compensate for the losses of the few, the more uncertain the event the more insurance becomes the most economical form of protection. Micro-insurance moreover, can break the cycle of poverty experience in Nigeria by providing low-income households, business and farmers with access to post disaster liquidity, thus protect their livelihoods and providing for reconstruction. Therefore, insured households and firms are more credit worthy; these kinds of insurance can also promote investments in productive assets and higher risk yield crops. As...|$|R
