5|$|Cool World marked Bakshi's {{return to}} feature films after nine years. The film was {{originally}} pitched as an animated horror film about an underground cartoonist who fathers an illegitimate half-real/half-cartoon daughter, <b>who</b> <b>hates</b> herself {{for what she}} is and tries to kill him. During production, Bakshi's original screenplay was scrapped by producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. and heavily rewritten by Michael Grais and Mark Victor in secret. Reviews praised the film's visuals, but criticized the story and characters, {{as well as the}} combination of live-action and animation, which some critics felt was unconvincing. The film would eventually gross only half its production budget.|$|E

5|$|The Watcher and {{his companions}} pursue Thaos {{to the city of}} Twin Elms, where they finally learn the truth behind Thaos' actions. The gods are {{synthetic}} beings created by ancient animancers to serve as a civilizing force for the world, which doesn't have any real gods. Thaos is the last survivor of their order, and has survived the centuries by transferring his soul from one body to the next. His eternal mission is to ensure that no one discovers the gods' secret, because then mortals would question their divine authority, and the world could then regress into sectarianism and barbarism. To this end, he works to discredit and suppress animancy wherever it flourishes, because modern animancers may eventually discover the truth through their science. He stole the souls of the Hollowborn to empower the goddess Woedica, <b>who</b> <b>hates</b> animancy and would see it destroyed. Though the other gods have an interest in protecting their secret, they do not want Woedica to dominate them, and so they help the Watcher reach Thaos.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourth}} game, the Xbox {{exclusive}} Halo 4, Cortana wakes the Chief when forces from an Ex-Covenant splinter faction attack {{the remains of}} the UNSC Forward Unto Dawn, then crashes with him on Requiem. Over the course of the game, Cortana begins showing strange signs and behavior: vocal and graphic glitches, irrational behavior and a tendency to become irritable or angered. Their cause is soon revealed: Cortana's operation beyond her seven-year lifespan and her interaction with the Halo installations and the Flood have caused her to become Rampant, a state of over-knowledge that makes AIs 'think' themselves to death. Helped by the Master Chief and kept safe from the captain of the Infinity, who wishes to delete her, she helps in the battle against the Didact, a rogue Forerunner <b>who</b> <b>hates</b> humans, and stops his scheme to convert all of humanity into his mechanical Promethean army using the Composer. In doing so, she has to fragment her various rampant personalities and upload them into the system, which first brings down the shields around the central core, then enables her to save Master Chief from the Didact. In a final act of love, she shields the Master Chief when he destroys the Composer, then, using the last of her energy to manifest as a solid hologram, she bids a final farewell to the Chief, managing to touch him for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Dexter {{receives}} a voice message from his foster sister Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter), {{a police officer}} in the vice department and, Dexter believes, the only person who loves him. Debra says she is at a crime scene and wants him to be there, because she needs his help. Dexter arrives and Debra, undercover as a prostitute, informs him that another hooker has been killed, the third in five months. Dexter inspects the victim and is shocked to learn that the chopped up corpse is bloodless. Dexter leaves, awed by the killer's technique, and says that {{due to the lack of}} blood he can't help out. At the police station, Dexter discusses another murder case being handled by James Doakes (Erik King), <b>who</b> <b>hates</b> Dexter and suspects he is hiding something. Dexter suggests that it was a crime of passion, rather than the bad drug deal Doakes believes it to be. Dexter surveils Jamie Jaworski, a murderer who escaped justice due to a faulty warrant, and breaks into his home to find proof of his crime. Once he confirms that Jaworski is guilty, Dexter meets with his girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), a domestic violence victim. Because of her violent past with her husband, Rita has no interest in sex, and Dexter secretly feels comfortable with the lack of intimacy. Rita has two young children, Astor and Cody, whom Dexter genuinely feels for. While on a date with Rita, Dexter finds another crime scene in which the victim has been cut into pieces with no traces of blood; this time, however, the head is missing. Dexter theorizes that the killer murders his victims in extreme cold, explaining the absence of blood. Dexter further suggests that a stolen refrigerated truck is being used for the murders. Dexter allows Debra to pitch the theory, but their superior officer, Lt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez), who dislikes Debra, dismisses it.|$|E

25|$|In {{an early}} 1980s track called 'Neću da živim u Bloku 65', popular Serbian band Riblja čorba sings about a {{depressed}} individual <b>who</b> <b>hates</b> {{the world because}} he's surrounded by the concrete of New Belgrade, while a more recent local cinematic trend sees New Belgrade presented somewhat clumsily as the Serbian version of New York ghettos like those found in Harlem, Brooklyn and The Bronx. The most obvious example of the latter would be 2002 movie 1 na 1, which portrays a bunch of Serbian teenagers who rap, shoot guns, play street basketball and seem to blame many of their woes on living in New Belgrade. Other films like Apsolutnih 100 and The Wounds also implicitly paint New Belgrade in the negative light {{but they have a}} more coherent point of view and place their stories {{within the context of the}} 1990s when war and international isolation truly did push some Serbs, including those inhabiting New Belgrade, to desperate acts.|$|E
25|$|Outside the Indian subcontinent, in Indonesia, {{a version}} was {{developed}} in ancient Java as Kakawin Bhāratayuddha in the 11th century under the patronage of King Dharmawangsa (990–1016) and later it spread to the neighboring island of Bali, which remains a Hindu majority island today. It has become the fertile source for Javanese literature, dance drama (wayang wong), and wayang shadow puppet performances. This Javanese version of the Mahābhārata differs slightly from the original Indian version. For example, Draupadi is only wed to Yudhishthira, not to all the Pandava brothers; this might demonstrate ancient Javanese opposition to polyandry. The author later added some female characters to be wed to the Pandavas, for example, Arjuna is described as having many wives and consorts next to Subhadra. Another difference is that Shikhandini does not change her sex and remains a woman, to be wed to Arjuna, and takes {{the role of a}} warrior princess during the war. Another twist is that Gandhari is described as antagonistic character <b>who</b> <b>hates</b> the Pandavas: her hate is out of jealousy because during Gandhari's swayamvara, {{she was in love with}} Pandu but was later wed to his blind elder brother instead, whom she did not love, so she blindfolded herself as protest. Another notable difference is the inclusion of the Punakawans, the clown servants of the main characters in the storyline. These characters include Semar, Petruk, Gareng and Bagong, who are much-loved by Indonesian audiences. There are also some spin-off episodes developed in ancient Java, such as Arjunawiwaha composed in 11th century.|$|E
