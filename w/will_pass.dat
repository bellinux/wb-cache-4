5|$|For a given tonnage, {{the second}} factor which governs the ship's {{dimensions}} {{is the size of}} the ports and waterways it will travel to. For example, a vessel that <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> the Panama Canal will be limited in its beam and draft. For most designs, the ratio of length-to-width ranges between 5 and 7, with an average of 6.2. The ratio of length-to-height will be between 11 and 12.|$|E
5|$|The {{efficacy}} of chemical pesticides tends to diminish over time. This is because any organism that manages {{to survive the}} initial application <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> on its genes to its offspring and a resistant strain will be developed. In this way, {{some of the most}} serious pests have developed resistance and are no longer killed by pesticides that used to kill their ancestors. This necessitates higher concentrations of chemical, more frequent applications and a movement to more expensive formulations.|$|E
5|$|Besides Athkatla, {{other places}} the player <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> through include: an island, on which stands both the port town of Brynnlaw and the asylum Spellhold; the Underdark; {{the city of}} Suldanessellar; and the Astral Plane. There are also other places, which may be explored: the Umar Hills, where people have been disappearing; a temple ruins, fallen {{under the shadow of}} the Shade Lord; the de'Arnise Keep, home of the de'Arnises but {{recently}} overrun by trolls; the town of Trademeet, under attack by animals; a druid grove connected to Trademeet's woes; the Windspear Hills, where the player becomes entangled in the intrigues of Firkraag, a dragon; the underwater Sahuagin city; and the Planar Prison.|$|E

5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, which states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a container with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is slightly depleted. A container wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{observations}} of accelerating expansion imply {{that more and}} more of the currently visible universe <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> beyond our event horizon and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called phantom energy theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called Big Rip.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{revolution}} around Neptune {{has become}} a nearly perfect circle with an eccentricity of almost zero. Viscoelastic damping from tides alone is not thought {{to be capable of}} circularizing Triton's orbit in the time since the origin of the system, and gas drag from a prograde debris disc is likely to have played a substantial role. Tidal interactions also cause Triton's orbit, which is already closer to Neptune than the Moon's is to Earth, to gradually decay further; predictions are that 3.6billion years from now, Triton <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> within Neptune's Roche limit. This will result in either a collision with Neptune's atmosphere or the breakup of Triton, forming a ring system similar to that found around Saturn.|$|E

5|$|Yet another {{structure}} {{available is}} λ/2 open-circuit stubs {{across the line}} coupled with λ/4 impedance transformers. This topology has both low-pass and band-pass characteristics. Because it <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> DC, {{it is possible to}} transmit biasing voltages to active components without the need for blocking capacitors. Also, since short-circuit links are not required, no assembly operations other than the board printing are required when implemented as stripline. The disadvantages are (i) the filter will take up more board real estate than the corresponding λ/4 stub filter, since the stubs are all twice as long; (ii) the first spurious passband is at 2ω0, as opposed to 3ω0 for the λ/4 stub filter.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} to Civil War Union General John Sedgwick {{stands on the}} outskirts of the Plain. Sedgwick's bronze statue has spurs with rowels that freely rotate. Legend states that if a cadet is in danger of failing a class, they are to don their full-dress parade uniform the night before the final exam. The cadet visits the statue and spins the rowels at the stroke of midnight. Then the cadet runs back to the barracks as fast as he or she can. According to legend, if Sedgwick's ghost catches them, they will fail the exam. Otherwise the cadet <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> the exam and the course. Although being out of their rooms after midnight is officially against regulations, violations have been known to be overlooked for the sake of tradition.|$|E
5|$|Approximately once a decade, a comet becomes {{bright enough}} to be noticed by a casual observer, leading such comets to be {{designated}} as great comets. Predicting whether a comet will become a great comet is notoriously difficult, as many factors may cause a comet's brightness to depart drastically from predictions. Broadly speaking, if a comet has a large and active nucleus, <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> close to the Sun, and is not obscured by the Sun {{as seen from the}} Earth when at its brightest, it has a chance of becoming a great comet. However, Comet Kohoutek in 1973 fulfilled all the criteria and was expected to become spectacular but failed to do so. Comet West, which appeared three years later, had much lower expectations but became an extremely impressive comet.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure {{announced}} a $160 million proposed O-Bahn City Access Project. The existing entry/exit at Hackney Road will be retained, but upgraded bus-only lanes on Hackney Road {{will lead to}} a new tunnel portal with bus guide rails commencing near the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The tunnel <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> under the Botanic Road intersection, then curve to the west under Rundle Park, Rundle Road and surface in Rymill Park leading to a redesigned intersection at Grenfell Street and East Terrace. Construction was anticipated to start in late 2015 with the project completed in 2017. The contract to complete the detailed design and construct the tunnel was let to McConnell Dowell in October 2015. SAGE Automation will provide expertise in the mechanical and electrical aspects of the tunnel including ventilation and safety systems. Construction started in March 2016 with removal of the median strip and preparation of central bus lanes. It is still expected to be completed by the end of 2017.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, Ophelia {{rushes to}} her father, {{telling him that}} Hamlet arrived at her door the prior night half-undressed and {{behaving}} crazily. Polonius blames love for Hamlet's madness and resolves to inform Claudius and Gertrude. As he enters to do so, {{the king and queen}} finish welcoming Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two student acquaintances of Hamlet, to Elsinore. The royal couple has requested that the students investigate the cause of Hamlet's mood and behavior. Additional news requires that Polonius wait to be heard: messengers from Norway inform Claudius that the King of Norway has rebuked Prince Fortinbras for attempting to re-fight his father's battles. The forces that Fortinbras had conscripted to march against Denmark will instead be sent against Poland, though they <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> through a portion of Denmark to get there.|$|E
5|$|The most {{promising}} {{but also the}} most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. Graham's law states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular mass, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, Karl P. Cohen and John R. Dunning.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been a steady {{increase}} in the energy output of the Sun. When the Sun first became a main sequence star, it radiated only 70% of the current luminosity. The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, rising by 1% every 110 million years. Likewise, in three billion years the Sun {{is expected to be}} 33% more luminous. The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be exhausted in five billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity reaches 121% above the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> through the subgiant stage and evolve into a red giant.|$|E
5|$|While {{the largely}} {{underground}} southern section will reach Ny Ellebjerg station from The Central Station by 2023. South of the Central Station will four new stations be built before the line terminus at Ny Ellebjerg. Three {{of these four}} stations <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> through the southern parts of Copenhagen's harbour. The northern terminus will presumably be moved farther and farther out at the peninsula, which constitutes {{a large part of}} Copenhagen's northern harbour part, as the city aims to rebuild typical harbour buildings with housing. However the political decisions on the M4 topic, so far only deals with a line with a total of 13 stations between Orientkaj and Ny Ellebjerg. In the end of 2019 will there be 4 Metro lines and 39 stations within the Copenhagen Metro system. And by 2023 will the Metro still comprises 4 lines, but 44 stations will be served instead of 39. Of the 44 stations in 2023, will 8 stations serve both Metro as well as S-train.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa County is {{the final}} Oklahoma county that both US-60 and US-69 <b>will</b> <b>pass</b> through. The two routes first pass through the town of Afton. The first highway {{junction}} in the county is with US-59, which concurs {{with the other two}} highways. Less than a mile north of the US-59 junction, the three highways pass through a cloverleaf interchange; proceeding north through this interchange places a motorist on US-59/US-69 bound for Miami, heading west leads to the toll booth for I-44, and turning east puts the motorist on US-60 eastbound. US-60, now with no other highways concurrent with it, will parallel the BNSF rail line for the remainder of its time in Oklahoma. The next town the route passes through is Fairland; here, it has a brief concurrency with SH-125. US-60 crosses the Neosho River (also known as the Grand River) into Twin Bridges State Park. Within the park, the highway serves as the southern terminus of SH-137. US-60 crosses the Spring River to exit the park. Northeast of Wyandotte, US-60 has a brief concurrency with SH-10. As it approaches the state line, US-60 Business splits from US-60, serving Seneca, Missouri. US-60 then leaves Oklahoma, continuing into Newton County, Missouri.|$|E
