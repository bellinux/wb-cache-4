These traditional Japanese flies differ from most Western flies, in that the hackle is tied facing forward. See traditional tenkara flies here My Best Streams by Yoshikazu Fujioka.|$|E

5000|$|A short, but concise Chapter 2 {{discusses}} {{the distinction between}} a floating (dry) fly and a sunk fly, with emphasis on {{the superiority of the}} floating fly as characterized by this concluding statement: On one point all must agree, viz., that fishing upstream with fine gut and small floating flies, where every movement of the fish, its rise at any passing natural, and the turn and rise at the artificial, are plainly visible, is far more exciting, and requires in many respects more skill, than the fishing of the water as practised by the <b>wet-fly</b> fisherman.

5000|$|From the Foreword:Rising {{from the}} perusal of [...] "Dry-Fly Fishing in Theory and Practice" [...] on its {{publication}} by F. M. Halford in 1889, I think I {{was at one}} with most anglers {{of the day in}} feeling that the last word had been written on the art of chalk-stream fishing—so sane, so clear, so comprehensive, is it so just and so in accord with one's own experience. Twenty years have gone by since then without my having had either occasion or inclination to go back at all upon this view of that, the greatest work, in my opinion, which has ever seen the light on the subject of angling for trout and grayling; and it is still, as regards that side of the subject with which it deals, all that I then believed it. But one result of the triumph of the dry fly, of which that work was the crown and consummation, was the obliteration from the minds of men, in much less than a generation, of all the <b>wet-fly</b> lore which had served many generations of chalk stream anglers well. The effect was stunning, hypnotic, submerging; and in these days, if one excepts a few eccentrics who have been nurtured on the wet fly on other waters, and have little experience of chalk streams, one would find few with any notion that anything but the dry fly could be effectively used upon Hampshire rivers, or that the wet fly was ever used there. I was for years myself under the spell, and it is the purpose of the ensuing pages to tell, {{for the benefit of the}} angling community, by what processes, by what stages, I have been led into a sustained effort to recover for this generation, and to transmute into forms suited to the modern conditions of sport on the chalk stream, the old <b>wet-fly</b> art, to be used as a supplement to, and in no sense to supplant or rival, the beautiful art of which Mr. F. M. Halford is the prophet. How far my effort has been successful I must leave my readers to judge. I myself feel that in making it I have widened my angling horizon, and that I have added enormously to the interest and charm of my angling days as well as to my chances of success, and that, too, by the use of no methods which the most rigid purist could rightly condemn, but by a difficult, delicate, fascinating, and entirely legitimate form of the art, well worthy of the naturalist sportsman.In the course of my too rare excursions to the river-side, I have elaborated some devices, methods of attack and handling, which I have found of service, some applicable to <b>wet-fly,</b> some to dry-fly fishing, or to both. In the hope that these may be of interest or service, I have included papers upon them.|$|E
5000|$|The work {{deals with}} fly fishing for trout, sea trout and salmon. Grey places {{presents}} fishing for sea trout as {{the pinnacle of}} fly fishing and describes the challenge of fly fishing for Atlantic salmon. On trout, {{he was the first}} writer of importance on the dry-fly who really knew what the <b>wet-fly</b> meant. Grey was an expert angler and he detailed much that is useful and instructive in prose that is clear and vigorous. What are the qualities which a man most needs to become a good angler? Let us assume that he starts with keenness, that the prospect of hooking a fish produces in him that feeling of excitement which is the motive for a desire to succeed, is the beginning of delight in angling, and, like a first element, cannot be analysed. ...In angling, as in all other recreations into which excitement enters, we have to be upon our guard, so that we can at any moment throw a weight of self-control into the scale against misfortune, and happily we can study to some purpose, both to increase our pleasure in success and to lessen the distress caused by what goes ill.

5000|$|Favorite Flies is {{a unique}} volume that compiles the stories and images of popular American {{artificial}} flies of the late 19th century. It {{is one of the}} earliest works to use chromolithography color plates. [...] Today, the original flies used to create the color plates are preserved in the American Museum of Fly Fishing in Manchester, Vermont. The stories for each fly described in the volume were obtained through correspondence with fly fisherman and fly tiers throughout the U.S. and Canada. The following is a typical story about the Professor, a popular <b>wet-fly</b> of time:No. 192. The Professor was named after the much-loved Professor John Wilson (Christopher North), and the story of the fly is, that one time, when this famous angler Was fishing, he ran short of flies, and, to create something of a flylike appearance, he fastened the petals of buttercups on his hook, adding bits of leaves or grass to imitate the wings of a fly. This arrangement was so successful that it led to the making of the fly with a yellow silk body, since then was widely known as the ProfessorProfessor. - A prime favorite; use it on almost all casts when I see more than one fly. When using a black tail fly, I use a brown fly and a Professor for droppers; find it a good fly under general conditions, when using a Miller for tail fly; then use Professor for droppers. From a letter from W. David Tomlin ("Norman") Duluth, Minn as favorite flies for trout in Michigan streams.|$|E
