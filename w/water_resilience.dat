While water may become a limiting factor for future development in general, as a drought prone and water poor country with rapid population growth, South Africa may face more serious challenges for sustainable development in the future. Using the model, we conduct numerical simulation for different parameter configurations with varying discount rate, climate change assumption, {{and the degree of}} uncertainty in future precipitation. We find that with sufficient capital accumulation, development can still be made sustainable despite of increased future water scarcity and decreased long-run sustainable welfare; While stochastic variation in precipitation has a negatively effect on <b>water</b> <b>resilience</b> and the expected dynamic welfare, the effect is mitigated by persistence in the precipitation pattern.

30|$|Water is a {{fundamental}} natural resource while agriculture water guarantees the grain output, which shows that the utilization and management of water resource have a significant practical meaning. Regional agricultural water resource system features with unpredictable, self-organization, and non-linear which lays a certain difficulty on the evaluation of regional agriculture <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience.</b> The current research on <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience</b> remains to focus on qualitative analysis and the quantitative analysis {{is still in the}} primary stage, thus, according to the above issues, projection pursuit classification model is brought forward. With the help of artificial fish-swarm algorithm (AFSA), it optimizes the projection index function, seeks for the optimal projection direction, and improves AFSA with the application of self-adaptive artificial fish step and crowding factor. Taking Hongxinglong Administration of Heilongjiang as the research base and on the basis of improving AFSA, it established the evaluation of projection pursuit classification model to agriculture <b>water</b> resource system <b>resilience</b> besides the proceeding analysis of projection pursuit classification model on accelerating genetic algorithm. The research shows that the <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience</b> of Hongxinglong is the best than Raohe Farm, and the last 597 Farm.

40|$|Urbanisation is {{a global}} multidimensional process paired with {{migration}} of people, changes in the capacity to sustain ecosystem services, and increasing uncertainty due to climate change. A consequence is water scarcity and floods. Urban water reforms should result in resilient water resource management that explicitly takes into account complexity, uncertainty and immediate and long term change. In order to increase the process of resilient solutions, global and local connections are necessary to exchange knowledge {{for the development of}} policies within cities. Policy will not move without the process of knowledge transfer and learning across cities. This resulted in the main focus of this research, namely, how knowledge transfer and policy learning between cities could be facilitated to promote urban <b>water</b> <b>resilience</b> in which a case study of Mexico City and Rotterdam was used. To understand the process of knowledge transfer and policy learning between cities a knowledge transfer model was developed to address this process to promote urban <b>water</b> <b>resilience.</b> The model was divided in four phases, namely, the exploration and marketing phase (1), the contact phase (2), the adoption phase (3), and the process of reflecting and internalization (4). Phase one stands for marketing on strengths of own system or exploring complementary knowledge for weaknesses of own system. Phase two stands for the first meetings between the actors in which creating a shared vision on the project is central. Phase three is the implementation of the innovation. Phase four stands for internalization of the transfer and reflecting on the process. A qualitative research is performed to study the model that existed of interviews and the method participant observer. According to the case and interviewees the mechanisms of phase one and two of the knowledge transfer model are crucial for preventing most obstacles that can arise within the implementation phase. A mutual understanding on struggles and histories helps with building trust especially with a lack of geographical proximity. A shared vision and committed local leaders are important requirements to secure and strengthen the process of implementation in the long term. Lastly, in the reflecting and internalization part, both cities gained knowledge and can use this knowledge in the next policy learning process. This process extends by creating networks of cities that allow a faster learning experience due to knowledge transfers and combining the existing and new knowledge to promote the development of urban <b>water</b> <b>resilience...</b>|$|E

30|$|According to the {{evaluation}} {{result from the}} improved AFSA, Raohe Farm and Hongqiling Farm have the strongest <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience</b> than Jiangchuan Farm, Baoshan Farm, 291 Farm, Shuangyashan Farm, Shuguang Farm and 853 Farm, and at last Youyi Farm, 597 Farm, 852 Farm and Beixing Farm. Entirely speaking, the <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience</b> of eastern area is the strongest than the northern and western area, and at last the middle area. The evaluation result conforms to the actual situation, and according to Fig.  1, there is Ussuri River in the east, Woken River in the west, and Songhua River {{in the north of}} Hongxinglong Administration, and farms close to rivers have a certain supplementation to the underground water, which promotes the <b>resilience</b> of <b>water</b> resource. From the collected data, the agricultural water consumption covers 90  % that of the overall water consumption, of which Baoshan Farm reaches 99.76  %, so it requires all farms to save agricultural water consumption with introducing water-saving irritation technology. The annual rainfall data present that the rainfall of Raohe Farm reaches 511.2  mm, Hongqiling Farm 456.3  mm, and 597 Farm 261.6  mm, and it is known that the rainfall is the key index influencing <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience,</b> which conforms to the actual information that rainfall directly affects the supplement of water resource and has a significant effect on <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience</b> of all regions. And compared with rainfall and agricultural water consumption, average per capita water resource is the least influencing factor: the average per capita water resource of Jiangchuan Farm reaches 11856.65  m 3 while Shuangyashan Farm 495.82  m 3. According to Table  2, the projection value of Jiangchuan Farm is 1.7876 while Shuangashan Farm 1.3725, which belongs to the same II degree. Thus, combining with agricultural water consumption (Jiangchuan Farm is 99.52  % while Shuangyashan Farm 90.03  %), it shows that the influence of average per capita water resource on <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience</b> is very small but still can not be ignored. The evaluation result of 12 farms in Hongxinglong Administration tells that the overall <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience</b> situation needs to be worried. The water consumption of all farms is very large while the supplement is small, which causes the continuous decline of water resource with weak resilience capability. Thus, {{it can be seen that}} the <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience</b> capability is the result of the combined effects of evaluation indexes instead of the determination of single index on the resilience.|$|R
30|$|The {{evaluation}} {{result of}} accelerating genetic algorithm {{shows that the}} <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience</b> of 853 Farm, Raohe Farm, 291 Farm, Jiangchuan Farm, and Hongqiling Farm is the strongest than Baoshan Farm, and the last Youyi Farm, 597, 852 Farm, Shuangyashan Farm, Shuguang Farm and Beixing Farm. The overall tendency of <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience</b> is increasing from the west to the east. The calculation result presents that the main index influencing <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience</b> is agricultural <b>water</b> consumption proportion, the electromechanical wells in unit arable land, and the ratio of effective irrigation area. The collected information tells the agricultural water consumption of 853 Farm (III degree) is 99.37  %, the electromechanical wells in unit arable land are three wells per hectare, and the maximum ratio of effective irrigation area is 49.02  %; the agricultural water consumption of Baoshan Farm (II degree) is 99.76  %, the electromechanical wells in unit arable land are 15 wells per hectare, and the maximum ratio of effective irrigation area is 55.98  %; and the agricultural water consumption of Youyi Farm (I degree) is 99.32  %, the electromechanical wells in unit arable land are four wells per hectare, and the maximum ratio of effective irrigation area is 89.87  %. From the comparison of Youyi Farm and 853 Farm, {{if there is a}} little difference between agricultural water consumption ratio and the quantity of electromechanical well in unit arable land, the <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience</b> of the farm with large effective irrigation area is contrarily weak and the difference between the index contribution rate and evaluation grading is comparatively large, thus, the projection pursuit classification model on the improved AFSA is more suitable for the evaluation of regional agricultural <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience</b> with its evaluation result closer to the actual situation and faster program run rate.|$|R
30|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of {{population}} and fast development of economy, the agricultural water supply and demand contradiction are increasing, resulting in a series of ecological and environmental problems, such as water pollution, falling of groundwater level, and obvious deterioration of regional agricultural water resource system. Therefore, the further study on regional agricultural <b>water</b> resource system <b>resilience</b> is the key for scientific utilization of water resource management. Holling (1973) creatively introduced resilience into the ecosystem stability and then the resilience research has been gradually recognized and accepted. The resilience mainly applied in the field of disaster (Shang et al. 2011; Manfredi et al. 2014); social ecology (Wang 2008; Perz et al. 2013) and economic management behavior (Comfort 1994). Vergano and Nunes (2007) established conceptual framework to recognize and describe resilience components from the economic perspective, taking the Venetian Lagoon as an example to make empirical assessment of the economic losses from the flood; Chang et al. (2013) took several US Columbia Rivers as example to study and analyze the vulnerability of their water resource with various ecological physical and social economic index representing water supply, water demand, and <b>water</b> quality. The <b>resilience</b> has been introduced into water resource field since the beginning of this century. Although Yu (2007) made evaluation of <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience</b> for Shanxi Province on the basis of raising the concept of <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience</b> and its features, there are still relatively few research articles on regional agricultural <b>water</b> resource <b>resilience.</b> At present, the research on <b>water</b> resource system <b>resilience</b> in and abroad remains in the model of conceptual level and case analysis; the study on resilience diagnosis method is still weak, and the resilience formation mechanism and influencing factor study are still in shortage, and the practical guiding from resilience diagnosis result still needs to be strengthened.|$|R

Therefore, a process model is required to explore the linkages and implications of utilising existing ad-hoc water saving technologies such as Rainwater Harvesting, Greywater Reuse and Sustainable Drainage Systems. This study provides a balanced alternative from traditional potable water supply and flood alleviation techniques, by adopting the concept of a secondary water supply, while providing the added advantage of controlling surface water runoff. However, for an evaluation process model to succeed at the planning and design stages there is also a need to have an in-depth understanding of not only legislation and policies, but also the complex multi-variables associated with site location demographics and key stakeholder preference. This Sustainable Water Evaluation Process (SWEP) was developed to integrate these complex variables by providing a quantative, qualitative and economic model analysis, in line with best management practice, assessed against selection scenarios, as defined by the model User. During this study the sustainability awareness and attitudinal change and concerns raised by both stakeholders and expert opinion on engineering and ecological difficulties are addressed through factors that include climate change, economic benefit and social inclusion. Adaptation options within this study illustrate the importance of addressing different socio-economic development scenarios. These scenarios have been demonstrated through a UK case study, which illustrates the advantages, associated with SWMS and reduced utility reliance from the regional network. The outcome of this research demonstrates a process model that is evidence based and provides, protects and promotes the use of combined S WMS practices at the development level to meet site specific conditions. The design decisions facilitate User flexibility while providing the land use planner, developer and designer with a process model for evaluating current SWMS technologies to provide greater emphasis on improved water resource management and the socio-economic issues that address <b>Water</b> <b>Resilience</b> and Water Security at the UK National, Regional and Local levels.

A case study into climate change adaptation and community resilience in the context of urban water management was undertaken in Wellington, New Zealand, using a 'post normal' science approach. Climate change and water demand scenarios for 2040 and 2090 were analysed using Greater Wellington Water’s 'sustainable yield' model and downscaled general circulation climate model data. Semi-structured interviews and a systems modelling workshop were conducted in order to gain an understanding of the local context for adaptation, resilience and response option selection. With a 20 % reduction of aggregate per capita demand and greater storage capacity, Wellington has sufficient water from current sources to smooth increased flow variability due to climate change and to meet increased demand from the projected increase in population.

40|$|AbstractMicrogrids have {{recently}} come into vogue {{as a potential}} solution to address {{the increasing number of}} power outages caused by extreme weather events that impact our cities and communities. Such events – often precipitated by increasing global temperatures and climate change – have repercussions that expand beyond damages to a city's electric infrastructure. Water infrastructure is similarly vulnerable to extreme weather events, resulting in significant impacts to clean water distribution, wastewater treatment, and stormwater management. Given this similarity, and other value drivers to be outlined, this paper proposes leveraging concepts behind electricity microgrids to develop a unified framework for microgrid application to promote <b>water</b> <b>resilience</b> in the face of our changing climate. Many parallels can be drawn between the electric grid and water infrastructure considering both are utilities that generate, store, and distribute an essential product that has been identified as a basic human right. Also similar to the electric grid, water infrastructure is aged and costly to redevelop. For both industries, microgrids are a potential solution that addresses aged infrastructure concerns while also being potentially more cost effective. In addition, by leveraging legacy infrastructural components while developing a new system within the system, microgrids provide redundancy, fortify vulnerabilities and secure the resource supply chain. This paper will investigate parallel components of electric and water infrastructure to provide a vision for future resilient water microgrids...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of cities is increasingly {{threatened by a}} worldwide water crisis. Urban water services (including drinking water, sanitation and drainage) are facing complex and multiple pressures, which are becoming increasingly frequent and severe. These pressures include floods, and the depletion, pollution and degradation of water resources and their associated ecosystems. These diverse pressures fall mainly within the domains of flood risk and water resources management: two working fields that are divided by different institutional structures, approaches and practices. Social learning is becoming increasingly popular as an approach {{that has the potential}} to “bridge” these silos, and ultimately, contribute to building resilience in urban water services.

40|$|Disasters {{and climate}} change impacts, as well as {{increased}} water demand, pose serious risks to the provision of sustainable urban water services, e. g., drinking water, sanitation, and safe drainage, especially in cities. These challenges call for a transition toward improved water management, including considerations of "resilience. " However, because the resilience concept has multidisciplinary origins it is open to multiple interpretations, which poses a challenge to understanding and operationalizing the concept. We explore how resilience thinking can be translated into urban water practice to develop the conceptual understanding of transitions toward sustainability. The study {{is based on a}} literature review, interviews with water experts, as well as four case studies in South Africa, India, Sweden, and the Philippines. We identify seven key principles or attributes of urban <b>water</b> <b>resilience</b> and the related transition process. We find that resilience building needs to discern between and manage three levels (i. e., socioeconomic, external hazard considerations, and larger social-ecological systems) to be sustainable. In addition, we find that human agency is a strong driver of transition processes, with a certain level of risk awareness and risk perception providing one threshold and a certain capacity for action to implement measures and reorganize in response to risks being another. The difficulty of achieving "knowledge to action" derives from the multiple challenges of crossing these two types of identified thresholds. To address long-term trends or stressors, we find an important role for social learning to ensure that the carrying capacity of urban water services is not exceeded or unwanted consequences are created (e. g., long-term trends like salinization and water depletion).

Cement and lime are widely used in some countries, but both have an associated embodied energy and carbon emissions that may hinder the benefits of unfired clay as a mainstream building material. The use of lignosulphonate was chosen as a way of minimizing the adverse environmental impacts whilst improving <b>water</b> <b>resilience,</b> an essential requirement for thin walled loadbearing masonry using earth. Unconfined compressive strength of extruded soil samples that have been stabilized by three types of lignosulphonate. Specimens were tested both dry and wet as a basis for comparing loss of strength due to exposure to a wet environment...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{domestic}} structures typically use masonry {{units that}} are approximately 100 mm thick. There is interest in using commercial methods of manufacture to produce earthen bricks {{that have a}} similar form factor to conventional masonry The large scale adoption of thin walled unfired earth masonry is dependent on its suitability {{for use in a}} load bearing application. High moisture content leading to full saturation, for example as a result of flooding, is a concern for unstablised earth construction, especially as wall thickness reduces. The greatest barrier for earth masonry adoption is the durability of the material when affected by high moisture content. Accidental and intentional wetting of a 100 mm thick load bearing unfired earth wall could lead to disproportionate collapse. The paper presents initial findings from an investigation into the use of geopolymer mechanism as a method of stabilisation. The use of geopolymer mechanism was chosen as a possible method of improving the <b>water</b> <b>resilience.</b> Soil that is used for commercial extruded fired brick production was chosen. The soil was selected as the precursor (source of the required silica and alumina) and this was mixed with various sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate activators. Specimens were tested both in their dry sate as well as following 24 hours of submersion in water. Compressive strength of cylinders after saturation, was used as an indicator of effective stabilisation. The maximum dry compressive strength achieved was 10. 4 N/mm 2 with the addition of 5 % sodium hydroxide and 20 % sodium silicate after curing at 105 °C. The most significant contributor to the strength gain was the addition of sodium silicate. Although some of the cylinders were able to be tested under fully saturated conditions the strengths achieved were negligible and insufficient for structural application. The potential for geopolymers as a method of stabilising unfired earth bricks is discussed with respect to the compressive strengths achieved...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to quantitatively measure the {{resilience}} of the building water cycle. In order to accomplish this goal, a framework was developed that outlines how building <b>water</b> <b>resilience</b> can be evaluated. The framework presented assumed that resilience describes the fulfillment of system functions; in this case, the system functions considered are those actualized by the building water system. A building <b>water</b> <b>resilience</b> assessment model (WRAM) was developed {{with the ability to}} simulate different building water cycles and resilience scenarios. Resilience is dependent on the type and magnitude of a disturbance. Therefore, unique disruption scenarios were developed to test the building water cycle resilience: (1) loss of municipal potable water and (2) loss of both municipal potable water and power. Under each scenario, the building water cycle was tested based on the type of building and the water management strategies utilized by the building. The WRAM requires organization of water demand and source connections, and an explicit prioritization framework was produced based on water source and demand preferences found in literature. The framework gives priority to treated wastewater, stormwater, rainwater, condensate, reclaimed water, and potable water, respectively. The baseline prioritization may be manipulated by restricting demand-source connections, and shifting priorities was shown to affect the potential for potable water offsets as a precursor to resilience. Real building water demand profiles were developed from data collected using smart meters at four building sites (multi-residential neighborhood, commercial building, elementary school, and community center). Water source profiles were developed using hourly climate data for the region. Detailed building water demand and supply profiles were developed for the multi-residential and elementary school building sites for resilience assessment using the WRAM. Each building water profile was adapted into 9 scenarios with each subjected to the two disruption schemes for 5 different disruption durations (1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours, and 168 hours) at 10 different randomized dates and time throughout the year. The result was 450 model runs for each building subjected to each disruption scheme (potable water loss or potable water and central power loss). The relationship between resilience and sustainability was examined based on sustainable building practices accepted by the U. S. Green Building Council 2 ̆ 7 s (USGBC) Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design (LEED) green building rating system. Building WRAM outcomes include unique water demand and supply profiles used to describe resilience in terms of the level of service (LOS) of building water functions. Analysis of water profiles validated redundancy, diversity, capacity, alternative water, passivity, preparation, and adaptation potential indicators as gauges of the resilience of the building water cycle. Results showed that resilience correlates with alternative water building water management strategies, but high resilience values are still attainable using storage of non-renewable, non-sustainable sources. However, building water cycles utilizing alternative water maintained steadier resilience as disruption lengths increase due to the ability of sources to be replenished during disruption events. The strongest correlation with LOS was observed for the diversity, redundancy, alternative water, and capacity indicators when scenarios utilizing only potable water were excluded from analysis. For these scenarios, correlation values were 0. 56 for diversity, 0. 56 for redundancy, 0. 60 for capacity, and 1. 00 for alternative water for the multi-residential building subjected to potable water loss; and 0. 33 for diversity, 0. 24 for redundancy, 0. 62 for capacity, and 1. 00 for alternative water for the multi-residential building subjected to both potable water and central power disruption. For elementary school scenarios that did not utilize potable water storage, correlation values were 0. 67 for diversity, 0. 64 for redundancy, 0. 06 for capacity, and 0. 89 for alternative water when subjected to disruption of potable water; and 0. 67 for diversity, 0. 64 for redundancy, 0. 06 for capacity, and 0. 80 for alternative water when subjected to disruption of potable water and central power. Passivity correlation to LOS was between 0. 77 and 1. 00 for all scenarios, building types, and disruption schemes. Passivity correlation with LOS was lower for potable water disruption scenarios, but higher when building water cycles lost power in addition to potable water. The average of each indicator was also calculated for each scenario for each of the five disruption durations by grouping the individual values from each of the 10 randomized disruption start dates and times. The correlation between the average capacity indicator and LOS greatly increased with this method to a range of 0. 41 to 0. 78 for all buildings subjected to each disruption scheme. In addition, a positive correlation between the preparation indicator and LOS (and corresponding negative correlation between the adaptation potential indicator and LOS) emerged for scenarios that do not utilize potable water storage. For disruption of potable water, the preparation correlation value was 0. 94 for the multi-residential building and 0. 78 for the elementary school. For disruption of potable water and central power, the preparation correlation value was 0. 32 for the multi-residential building and 0. 79 for the elementary school...|$|E
