2500|$|Both {{of these}} options had their problems—there {{was always a}} chance of {{striking}} part of the fuselage when bailing out, {{and a number of}} pilots had been killed in this way. Ditching the Hurricane in the sea called for skill as the radiator housing acted as a <b>water</b> <b>brake,</b> pitching the nose of the fighter downwards when it hit the water, while also acting as a very efficient scoop, helping to flood the Hurricane so that a quick exit was necessary before the aircraft sank. Then the pilot had to be picked up by a ship. More than 80 modifications were needed to convert a Hurricane into a Sea Hurricane, including new radios to conform with those used by the Fleet Air Arm and new instrumentation to read in knots rather than miles per hour. They were informally known as [...] "Hurricats".|$|E

5000|$|Campbell did {{not wait}} to refuel after doing a first run of 297.6 mph and hence the boat was lighter and {{travelled}} through the wash caused by his first run, a wash made much worse {{by the use of}} the <b>water</b> <b>brake.</b> These factors have since been found to be not particularly important: The <b>water</b> <b>brake</b> was used well to the south of the measured distance, and only from approx. 200 mph. The area in the centre of the course where Bluebird was travelling at peak speed on her return run was flat calm, and not disturbed by the wash from the first run, which had not had time to be reflected back on the course. Campbell knew this and, as discussed previously, adopted his well-practiced, 'quick turn-around' strategy.|$|E
50|$|In 1877, he was {{commissioned}} by the Admiralty to produce a machine capable of absorbing and measuring the power of large naval engines. He invented and built the world's first <b>water</b> <b>brake</b> dynamometer, sometimes known as the hydraulic dynamometer, {{which led to the}} formation of Heenan & Froude Ltd in Birmingham.|$|E
50|$|Heenan & Froude was a United Kingdom-based {{engineering}} company, {{founded in}} Newton Heath, Manchester, England in 1881 in a partnership formed by engineers Richard Froude and Hammerley Heenan.

40|$|Author {{offers a}} new method of getting {{electric}} energy from moving water. A special injector injects electrons into water. Water stream picks up the electrons and moves them {{in the direction of}} stream which is against the direction of electric field. At some distance from injector a unique grid acquires the electrons, thus charging and producing electricity. This method does not require, as does other water energy devices, strong dams, water turbines, or electric generators. The proposed water installation is very cheap. The area of <b>water</b> <b>braking</b> may be large and produces a great deal of energy. This electron water installation may be in river or ocean stream (as Gulf Stream) ...|$|R

Coleman Engineering Company was contracted for $2 million in June 1954 and constructed the Supersonic Military Air Research Track (SMART), mechanical arresting gear (<b>water</b> <b>brakes</b> with 34 tons of force), retro rockets, and photographic/telemetering facilities. Coleman was also contracted for operations on November 30, 1955, and achieved a [...] "world land speed record using a 9,400-pound sled rocketing down the track at 1,800 miles per hour." [...] The numerous test facilities included a powered comparator for high-speed motion pictures, a 1956 IBM 706 computer, and 1960 Bendix G-15 computer. Control of the site transferred from Indian Springs Air Force Base on November 6, 1957, and from Wright-Patterson AFB to Edwards AFB on March 9, 1962—the base was placed on standby in December 1961, and was closed on June 20, 1963.|$|R
50|$|On 4 January 1967, Campbell mounted {{his record}} attempt. He {{was killed when}} K7 flipped over and broke up at a speed in excess of 300 mph. Bluebird had {{completed}} an initial north-south run {{at an average of}} 297.6 mph, and Campbell used a new <b>water</b> <b>brake</b> to slow K7 from a peak speed of 311 mph when he left the measured kilometre.|$|E
50|$|Diesel engined {{locomotives}} with {{hydraulic transmission}} may be equipped for hydrodynamic braking. In this case, the torque converter or fluid coupling {{acts as a}} retarder {{in the same way}} as a <b>water</b> <b>brake.</b> Braking energy heats the hydraulic fluid, and the heat is dissipated (via a heat exchanger) by the engine cooling radiator. The engine will be idling (and producing little heat) during braking, so the radiator is not overloaded.|$|E
50|$|Because the boat's <b>water</b> <b>brake</b> {{was found}} to be {{extended}} when the wreck was recovered, it was generally assumed that Campbell had activated it to slow down before the boat had left the water on his final run. On dismantling the boat, however, a hydraulic accumulator from the donor Gnat aircraft was discovered to be still connected to the system, meaning that stored hydraulic pressure may well have deployed the brake after the accident.|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a reliable, cost-effective, rapid and infield voltammetric method {{for the detection}} of barium. The optimized method consists of an ultrathin mercury film deposited in-situ on a glassy carbon electrode in 0. 02 M potassium chloride without deoxygenation; a deposition potential of - 2500 mV, pulse height = 50 mV, step duration = 10 ms and a scan rate of 100 mV/s using differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DP-ASV). The linear working range for barium was determined to be 5 – 80 μg/L (r 2 = 0. 997), and limit of detection (LOD) was 1. 6 μg/L, for 30 sec deposition time. Percent relative standard deviation for 10 measurements performed at 20 μg/L was 5. 8 %. Application of the method allowed for the quantitative determination of barium concentration in a variety of <b>waters,</b> <b>brake</b> pad dust and gunshot residue (GSR) samples. Comparative analysis of sample results from DP-ASV with inductively-coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) showed a mean percent difference of 1. 8 %. The method also permitted the simultaneous measurement of barium and lead, crucial for GSR samples...|$|R

In 1883, {{after the death of}} his father William Froude, Richard inherited the rights to his father's patents, including that for the manufacture of the <b>water</b> <b>brake</b> dynamometer.|$|E
50|$|There are varying {{theories}} about {{the cause of the}} crash. Not waiting to refuel meant the boat was lighter. The wash from the first run would have been made worse by use of the water brake; however, the wash had not had time to reflect back to the centre of the course, and Campbell had used the <b>water</b> <b>brake</b> well to the south. The still photographs taken of {{the latter part of the}} final run clearly show that the <b>water</b> <b>brake</b> was not deployed then, and also that when K7 became airborne, the jet engine was no longer functioning: the exhaust would have very noticeably disturbed the water. The engine had therefore flamed out. It is impossible to be certain why: fuel starvation, damage to a structural element during the bouncing, disturbance of the airstream into the intakes during pitching, or a combination of causes are all possible. The most likely ultimate cause is that Bluebird exceeded its aerodynamic static stability limit, with loss of engine thrust, damage to the port spar fairing, and the then little understood ground effect lift enhancement all adding to the instability.|$|E
50|$|The heated, {{pressurized}} {{water of the}} S1W reactor power plant was circulated through heat exchangers in order to generate high pressure saturated steam in a separate water loop. This saturated steam powered steam turbines for propulsion and generation of electricity. These facilities were constructed inside an elevated hull simulating the engineering portion of the Nautilus hull. A single propeller was simulated through use of a <b>water</b> <b>brake.</b> Large, exterior water spray ponds were used to dissipate the heat energy created in the facility into the air.|$|E

50|$|The {{recovered}} wreck {{revealed that}} the <b>water</b> <b>brake</b> had deployed after the accident {{as a result of}} stored accumulator pressure; Campbell would not have had time to deploy the relatively slow-moving brake as the boat flipped out of control. The boat still contained fuel in the engine fuel lines, discounting the fuel-starvation theory. The wreckage all evidenced an impact from left to right, wiping the whole front of the boat off in that direction. Campbell's lower harness mounts had failed and were found to be effectively useless. Further dives recovered various parts of K7, which had separated from the main hull when it broke up on impact.|$|E
