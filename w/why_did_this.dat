Her hair, as is the way of fine, soft, almost indigo-colored hair, was already showing threads of silver; her whole face and figure thinner than he had remembered. But a striking woman still--with wonderful eyes! Her dress--Felix had scanned many a crank in his day--was not so alarming as it had once seemed to Clara; its coarse-woven, deep-blue linen and needle-worked yoke were pleasing to him, and he could hardly take his gaze from the kingfisher-blue band or fillet that she wore round that silver-threaded black hair.|$|E

Besides, though no one could have the least objection to their being bestowed on the Whites, the very fact of this being her third secret meeting with Kalliope was beginning to occasion an awkwardness in accounting for her knowledge of their needs.

6000|$|In pondering {{over the}} matter since, I {{have often been}} led to ask myself with {{considerable}} surprise, <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> war occur--who wanted it? It is quite plain that Europe did not, equally plain that Turkey did not, still more plain that the Emperor Alexander did not, for he wept {{at the prospect of}} it [...] "like a child." [...] Who, then, did desire and cause it? There are some things in this remarkable world that no man can understand. At all events I cannot. When I put the same question, long afterwards, to my dear and ever-sagacious mother, she replied, [...] "Do you not think, Jeff; that perhaps the men in power, somewhere, wanted it and caused it? There are some countries, you know, where the people are mere chessmen, who have nothing whatever to do or say in the management of their own affairs, and are knocked about, wisely or foolishly as the case may be, by the men in power. England herself was in that sad case once, if we are to believe our school histories, and some of the European nations seem to be only now struggling slowly out of that condition, while others are still in bondage." ...|$|E
60|$|I do not {{say that}} they had no excuses for being untrue to their own faith. We are not here to judge them. That {{peculiar}} subtlety of mind, which rendered the Alexandrians the great thinkers of the then world, had with Christians, as well as Heathens, the effect of alluring them away from practice to speculation. The Christian school, as was to be expected from the moral ground of their philosophy, yielded to it far more slowly than the Heathen, but they did yield, and especially after they had conquered and expelled the Heathen school. Moreover, the long battle with the Heathen school had stirred up in them habits of exclusiveness, of denunciation; the spirit which cannot assert a fact, without dogmatising rashly and harshly on the consequences of denying that fact. Their minds assumed a permanent habit of combativeness. Having no more Heathens to fight, they began fighting each other, excommunicating each other; denying to all who differed from them any share of that light, to claim which for all men had been the very ground of their philosophy. Not that they would have refused the Logos to all men in words. They would have cursed a man for denying the existence of the Logos in every man; but they would have equally cursed him for acting on his existence in practice, and treating the heretic as one who had that within him to which a preacher might appeal. Thus they became Dogmatists; that is, men who assert a truth so fiercely, as to forget that a truth is meant to be used, and not merely asserted--if, indeed, the fierce assertion of a truth in frail man is not generally a sign of some secret doubt of it, and in inverse proportion to his practical living faith in it: just as he who is always telling you that he is a man, is not the most likely to behave like a man. And <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> befall them? Because they forgot practically that the light proceeded from a Person. They could argue over notions and dogmas deduced from the notion of His personality: but they were shut up in those notions; they had forgotten that if He was a Person, His eye was on them, His rule and kingdom within them; and that if He was a Person, He had a character, and that that character was a righteous and a loving character: and therefore they were not ashamed, in defending these notions and dogmas about Him, to commit acts abhorrent to His character, to lie, to slander, to intrigue, to hate, even to murder, for the sake of what they madly called His glory: but which was really only their own glory--the glory of their own dogmas; of propositions and conclusions in their own brain, which, true or false, were equally heretical in their mouths, because they used them only as watchwords of division. Orthodox or unorthodox, they lost the knowledge of God, for they lost the knowledge of righteousness, and love, and peace. That Divine Logos, and theology as a whole, receded further and further aloft into abysmal heights, as it became a mere dreary system of dead scientific terms, having no practical bearing on their hearts and lives; and then they, as the Neoplatonists had done before them, filled up the void by those daemonologies, images, base Fetish worships, which made the Mohammedan invaders regard them, and I believe justly, as polytheists and idolaters, base as the pagan Arabs of the desert.|$|E

50|$|Material Culture and Social Formations in Ancient India {{is a book}} by Professor Ram Sharan Sharma, {{published}} in 1985. The author surveys theories of social change and underlines the key role of production techniques together with climatic conditions in shaping ancient social formations. Several questions are raised: What was the extent of cattle pastoralism in early Vedic times and how was it linked with tribalism and booty capture? Why could the later Vedic people not develop a full-fledged state and class system? What part did iron play in war and production in northern India? Why did Buddhism appear around 600 BC and <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> happen in the middle Gangetic plains? How many forms of society {{are reflected in the}} epics? Rural relics of ancient life and its glimpses in terracottas are also discussed. To tackle these problems, Vedic, epic and Buddhist texts are examined in the light of material remains, tribal studies and archaic social survivals.|$|E

5000|$|Quantitative {{research}} is often contrasted with qualitative research, {{which is the}} examination, analysis and interpretation of observations {{for the purpose of}} discovering underlying meanings and patterns of relationships, including classifications of types of phenomena and entities, in a manner that does not involve mathematical models. Approaches to quantitative psychology were first modeled on quantitative approaches in the physical sciences by Gustav Fechner in his work on psychophysics, which built on the work of Ernst Heinrich Weber. Although a distinction is commonly drawn between qualitative and quantitative aspects of scientific investigation, {{it has been argued that}} the two go hand in hand. For example, based on analysis of the history of science, Kuhn concludes that “large amounts of qualitative work have usually been prerequisite to fruitful quantification in the physical sciences”. [...] Qualitative {{research is}} often used to gain a general sense of phenomena and to form theories that can be tested using further quantitative research. For instance, in the social sciences qualitative research methods are often used to gain better understanding of such things as intentionality (from the speech response of the researchee) and meaning (<b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> person/group say something and what did it mean to them?) (Kieron Yeoman).|$|E
5000|$|From 1882 through 1897 {{newspaper}} reports {{refer to this}} competition consistently as ''''The Leinster Challenge Cup''''. From 1898 through 2006, press reports refer to the competition as ''''The Leinster Senior Cup''''. How and <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> change in title come about? The change in reference title probably {{had more to do}} with semantics rather than any change(s) in the rules governing the competition. At a General Meeting of the Leinster Branch of the I.R.F.U. held in the Wicklow Hotel on 11 November 1888, a resolution was adopted to inaugurate a Leinster Junior Cup competition on the same basis as applied to the Leinster Challenge Cup. Following the Hon. Treasurer's report to the Annual General Meeting a month earlier, it had been proposed that the Leinster Branch purchase a 'Challenge Cup' for such competition. At the Leinster Branch A.G.M in October 1891, a motion that the 2nd XVs of Senior Clubs be allowed to compete in the Leinster Junior Cup was rejected. Essentially the same motion returned the Leinster Branch AGM in October 1895, but was amended to refer the matter to a subcommittee to draft rules to govern the proposed competition under which the latter might be approved and discussion adjourned to the next General Meeting. At the reconvened meeting in November 1895, delegates were informed that the original motion had been withdrawn because of intense opposition. The meeting then reconstituted itself as a special meeting to consider a new resolution [...] "that a Cup be presented by the Leinster Branch for competition amongst Second Fifteens of senior clubs on a league basis". After much discussion and consideration of umpteen amendments and counter proposals, the final phrase of the original motion was amended to read [...] "amongst Junior Clubs and Second Fifteens of senior clubs on a league basis". This was passed unanimously. Thus the Leinster Branch I.R.F.U. from the 1886-87 season now had a Leinster Junior Cup, the winners of which received a Challenge Cup, a Junior League Cup for Junior Clubs and the 2nd XVs of Senior Clubs, and a Leinster Challenge Cup, contested by Senior Clubs. Thus, to avoid confusion in reports of competitions, the Leinster Challenge Cup became referred to as the Leinster Senior Cup, the winners of which were presented with the original Challenge Cup.|$|E
5000|$|This type of play {{became known}} as a well-made-play. However, in [...] "Patience," [...] Jason Sherman takes viewers and readers to a {{non-linear}} route using flashbacks of the past, mainly a party ten years ago, which help give insight to the play's direction. The flashbacks help viewers understand the characters' thought processes and give answers to questions one might have about their lives. For example, when it is revealed that Sarah was the girl Reuben had written those letters to. With those flashbacks {{it is easy to}} see the seven components of a well-made-play. The order of these is as follows:1. State of equilibrium-Reuben is a successful businessman and has a happy marriage with two kids.2. Inciting incident- A friend from the past comes to visit Reuben while at dinner. He asks Reuben if he is happy and what he would do if he lost everything? He leaves Reuben with a final question, “Do you need everything you have?”3. Point of Attack or Major Dramatic Question- Reuben does lose everything, he gets fired, his wife leaves him, and his brother dies. The question is then what will he do if he lost everything?4. Rising action- This takes place three months later, why? Because his state of mind during those three months had not changed. Reuben has many talks with his brother Phil, Sarah, Liz, and a Rabbi about finding the point that started all of this. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> happen to him. Each character’s opinion and conversation helps him on his journey but leads to more question.5. Climax- He runs into Donna at the subway. They have a lengthy conversation where she blames Reuben for all the troubles. Reuben had been looking for someone else to blame the whole time and never looked at himself. This is the first time he finally sees who was really to blame.6. Resolution - He is coming to grips with the fact that it was his fault. He uses the starting point for when everything started going wrong as when he was born. It is apparent that he really took what Donna said to heart because he quotes her while talking to Liz. “I will suck the life out of you”7. New state of equilibrium-At the end of the play Reuben says “I know” as a response to the end of a monologue by Phil in a flash back from the party. The basic outcome was that we are all alone and can either wait alone in the darkness or share our love withthe ones that love us. Although it seems that Reuben has chosen the first route of being alone.|$|E
