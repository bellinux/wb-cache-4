During a time of war, {{during a time of}} {{economic}} hardship, when asked to serve your country in a sensitive position where you can actually bring a background to help your nation, I'm the kind of person who's going to stand up and do it, and I'll take that philosophy to my grave... In terms of the stimulus you talked about, it was failed. [...] And {{let me tell you what}} I talked about with respect to the stimulus. I talked about the need for more tax cuts in the stimulus... We had done historic tax cuts. <b>We</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation. I am running on my record, and I am proud to run on my record.|$|E

Wentz explained [...] "The whole campaign is part of the record and people can call it whatever they want, but the mixtape was part of that campaign, and we'll see what happens from here...In creating this autocratic organization, <b>we</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> democratic campaign, because people have made it go the direction they wanted it to go." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hunt {{has also}} been criticised for the prejudiced views he propagates. Writing for The Times, Tim Teeman {{expressed}} concern over an episode of Ashes to Ashes which focused on overt homophobia, writing: [...] "No doubt the justification here is that it's Gene Hunt, everyone knows he's a bigot, that's what he'd say. And he and his mates were shown to be fools. But it was said with lip-smacking relish. Gene Hunt is {{on the brink of}} becoming a kind of icon of the sniggering, unreconstructed lad." [...] Ashley Pharoah, co-creator of both Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes, has also voiced concern on this issue, commenting: [...] "There have been times I have wondered: have <b>we</b> <b>created</b> <b>a</b> pin-up boy for the Daily Mail?
