Henri Poincaré was more cautious, saying they only defined natural numbers if they were consistent; {{if there is a}} proof that starts from just these axioms and derives a contradiction such as 0 = 1, then the axioms are inconsistent, and don't define anything. In 1900, David Hilbert posed the problem of proving their {{consistency}} using only finitistic methods as the second of his twenty-three problems. In 1931, Kurt Gödel proved his second incompleteness theorem, which shows that such a consistency proof cannot be formalized within Peano arithmetic itself.|$|E

[...] In praise of Coward's versatility, Lord Mountbatten said, in a tribute on Coward's seventieth birthday, [...] "There are probably greater painters than Noël, greater novelists than Noël, greater librettists, greater composers of music, greater singers, greater dancers, greater comedians, greater tragedians, greater stage producers, greater film directors, greater cabaret artists, greater TV stars.

500|$|Sgt. Pepper was {{the first}} major pop/rock LP to include its {{complete}} lyrics, which appeared on the back cover. Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album {{was the subject of a}} scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were [...] "listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy". Poirier identified what he termed its [...] "mixed allusiveness": [...] "It's unwise ever to assume that they're doing only one thing or expressing themselves in only one style... one kind of feeling about a subject isn't enough... any single induced feeling must often exist within the context of seemingly contradictory alternatives." [...] McCartney said at the time: [...] "We write songs. We know <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> them. But in a week someone else says something about it, and you can't deny it.... You put your own meaning at your own level to our songs." [...] The album's elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study. A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people. The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style, while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their [...] "brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms" [...] as a knowingly [...] "anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment" [...] display. [...] In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked it number one on its list of the [...] "500 Greatest Albums of All Time".|$|E

2500|$|In {{summarizing}} the biographical works on Gandhi, Blema S. Steinberg concluded she was decidedly non-ideological. Only 7.4% (24) {{of the total}} 330 biographical extractions posit ideology {{as a reason for}} her policy choices. Steinberg noted Gandhi's association with socialism was superficial; only having a general and traditional commitment to the ideology, by way of her political and family ties. Gandhi personally had a fuzzy concept of socialism. In one of the early interviews she had given as Prime Minister, Gandhi had ruminated: [...] "I suppose you could call me a socialist, but you have understand <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> that term...we used the word [...] because it came closest to {{what we wanted to do}} here – which is to eradicate poverty. You can call it socialism; but if by using that word we arouse controversy, I don't see why we should use it. I don't believe in words at all." [...] Regardless of the debate over her ideology or lack of thereof, Gandhi remains a left-wing icon. She has been described by Hindustan Times columnist, Pankaj Vohra as [...] "arguably the greatest mass leader of the last century." [...] Her campaign slogan, Garibi Hatao (Eng: Remove Poverty), has become the iconic motto of the Indian National Congress.
