50|$|Owing to its {{birefringent}} nature, the AOPDF {{is intrinsically}} polarization-sensitive. Furthermore, polarization of the diffracted wave, created {{as the result}} of the interaction between the incident optical wave and the acoustic wave in the crystal, is rotate by 90° with respect to the incident <b>wave</b> <b>polarization.</b> For the single-beam optical input there could be up to 4 beams at the output of the AOPDF: two transmitted (non-diffracted) beams arising from double refraction and (in the presence of a suitable acoustic wave in the crystal) two diffracted beams corresponding to each linear polarization component (ordinary and extraordinary) of the input beam. Typically, ordinary-polarized beam is used at the input and so, only two beams are observed at the output: ordinary-polarized transmitted beam and extraordinary-polarized diffracted beam.|$|E

In this paper, an optimization of EM <b>waves</b> <b>polarization</b> modes for the occurrence of SPR by using a modified optical waveguiding assembly has been discussed. A 633 nm of linearly polarized He-Ne laser was appointed as a light source. The polarization modes were controlled by rotating the position of He-Ne laser.

The location of the critical angle was observed at θC = 46 °. For the validation purpose, a simulation based on Fresnel equation was conducted where the percentage difference between the experimental and theoretical results were analyzed. The percentage difference between experimental and theoretical results for both θSPR and θC were 9. 09 % and 15. 00 % respectively.

40|$|Abstract. The {{quantification}} of <b>wave</b> <b>polarization</b> {{characteristics of}} ULF waves from the geomagnetic field variations is done under ‘a priori ’ assumption that fields of internal induced currents are in-phase with the external inducing fields.

The amplitude and phase changes that these perturbations produce, in the resultant fields at the Earth’s surface, make determination of polarization and phase of the oscillating external signals problematic.
