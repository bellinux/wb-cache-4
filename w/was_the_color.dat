5|$|Green {{today is}} not {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented love and the base, natural desires of man. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of the serpent in the Garden of Eden who caused the downfall of Adam and Eve. However, for the troubadours, green <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for young women who were not yet married.|$|E
5|$|The Romans had {{a greater}} {{appreciation}} for the color green; it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of Venus, the goddess of gardens, vegetables and vineyards. The Romans made a fine green earth pigment that was widely used in the wall paintings of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Lyon, Vaison-la-Romaine, and other Roman cities. They also used the pigment verdigris, made by soaking copper plates in fermenting wine. By the second century AD, the Romans were using green in paintings, mosaics and glass, and there were ten different words in Latin for varieties of green.|$|E
5|$|Until the 18th century, Lipizzans {{had other}} coat colors, {{including}} dun, bay, chestnut, black, piebald and skewbald. However, gray is a dominant gene. Gray <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> preferred by the royal family, {{and so the}} color was emphasized in breeding practices. Thus, in a small breed population when the color was deliberately selected as a desirable feature, {{it came to be}} the color of the overwhelming majority of Lipizzan horses. However, it is a long-standing tradition for the Spanish Riding School to have at least one bay Lipizzan stallion in residence, and this tradition is continued through the present day.|$|E

5|$|Although a real ninja wears {{black to}} be inconspicuous, Kishimoto gave Naruto an orange {{jumpsuit}} {{to fit the}} shōnen genre. His wardrobe is based on clothing that Kishimoto wore when he was younger. According to him, a pre-existing design {{would not have made}} Naruto unique, whereas something original would have made him too distinctive. Because Naruto is associated with spirals in terms of objects he uses, the designer incorporated swirl patterns into the costume. Initial illustrations depicted Naruto in boots, but Kishimoto replaced these with sandals, because he enjoys drawing toes. The goggles Naruto used to wear were replaced with a hitai-ite, or shinobi headband, because they were too time-consuming to draw. One of the most difficult design choices <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> palette of Naruto's outfit. The orange in his costume makes Naruto pop and the blue parts are complementary. Kishimoto apologized to the anime staff for Naruto's design, as he considered it too difficult to animate.|$|E

25|$|Two kit {{versions}} of the Chrysler Turbine Car were significant - a standard bronze colored promotional authentic to the cars used by the public, and a white version that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> {{of one of the}} test mules, which was also lent for the making of the movie The Lively Set. This model had a friction motor and fewer than 500 were produced. Some of the Turbine models were nearly as incredible as the real car, with such details as folding seats, opening doors, hood, deck lid, and steerable front wheels. Chassis detail was remarkable, accurately depicting the huge ducting passages running the length of the car needed to expel the turbine's waste gasses.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{the game}} was {{televised}} nationally by NBC. It was also streamed live online, both to computers (via NFL.com and NBCSports.com) and mobile devices (via Verizon Wireless's NFL Mobile app), the first legal online streaming of a Super Bowl telecast in the USA. Al Michaels called play-by-play for NBC, marking the eighth {{time that he was}} behind the microphone for a Super Bowl and the second time he called a Super Bowl for NBC (Michaels had previously done play-by-play for Super Bowls XXII, XXV, XXIX, XXXIV, XXXVII, and XL for ABC and Super Bowl XLIII for NBC). Cris Collinsworth <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> analyst for the game, his second Super Bowl as a game analyst and first since he was in the booth for Super Bowl XXXIX for Fox. Michele Tafoya was the sideline reporter.

25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, these uniforms became outdated. The Fechheimer Bros. of Cincinnati {{created some}} uniforms for OSU. These uniforms {{were the same}} navy blue as the {{previous}} uniforms, except the buttons were changed to silver. At this time the chin straps and Eagle Ohio were also changed to silver. The plumes took on the modern red and gray appearance and were constructed of tough turkey feathers. The spats were changed from cloth to vinyl during this time as well. The shoulder patches changed design and size. The uniforms changed very little from the 1970s until 1988, except for things like hat manufacturer, a short period in which a large metal diamond Ohio replaced the Eagle Ohio, {{and the use of}} aluminum hat bands instead of the silver adjustable type. After the directorship of Charles Spohn, the Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma recognition bars were no longer authorized for wear on the OSUMB uniform. During the expansion years in the 1970s, many uniforms dating back to the 1940s had to be dug out of storage and updated with the current patch designs of the band. To a careful and up-close observer, one would notice significant differences in the cut and style of the uniforms being worn. Even hats were not standardized. The only common thread among the uniforms <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color,</b> which even began to fade on older uniforms. It was common practice for band members to use black marker to fix frayed parts of the uniform which exposed white cotton lining. These uniforms also had to be used by the Military band, and were falling apart. Pieces were sourced as needed from manufacturers such as Ostwald, Bayly, Frechheimer, and DeMoulin Brothers. The Fechheimer Corporation began producing a police uniform in the 1980s that matched the design of the Marching Band uniforms. These eventually became the standard replacement uniform coat until 1989, when Dr. Woods commissioned a new uniform style.|$|E
500|$|In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, green <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> {{commonly}} associated with merchants, bankers and the gentry, while red was reserved for the nobility. [...] For this reason, the costume of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci and the benches in the British House of Commons are while those in the House of Lords are red. It also has a long historical tradition as the color of Ireland and of Gaelic culture. It is the historic color of Islam, representing the lush vegetation of Paradise. [...] It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of the banner of Muhammad, and {{is found in the}} flags of nearly all Islamic countries. [...] Because of its association with nature, it became the color of the Environmental Movement in the 1960s, and Green Parties were founded in many counties.|$|E
500|$|The flag of Italy (1797) {{was modeled}} after the French tricolor. [...] It was {{originally}} {{the flag of the}} Cisalpine Republic, whose capital was Milan; red and white were the colors of Milan, and green <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of the military uniforms of the army of the Cisalpine Republic.

500|$|A {{challenge}} in animating Ariel for the 1989 film <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> required to show Ariel {{in the changing}} environments, both under the sea and on land, for which the animators required thirty-two color models, not including costume changes. The bluish-green color of Ariel's fin was a hue specially mixed by the Disney paint lab; the color was named [...] "Ariel" [...] after the character. The choice of red as Ariel's hair color {{was the subject of}} dispute between the filmmakers and studio executives who wanted the character to have blonde hair. It was noted that red hair contrasted better with Ariel's green tail, red was easier to darken than yellow, and Disney's live-action branch Touchstone Pictures had recently released Splash that had a blonde mermaid; Ariel's red hair was ultimately kept.|$|E
500|$|As {{a student}} of Hans Hofmann she was taught to {{practice}} her art with a limited palette, using colors such as black and white, to [...] "discipline" [...] herself. These colors would become part of Nevelson's repertoire. She spray painted her walls black until 1959. Nevelson described black as the [...] "total color" [...] that [...] "means totality. It means: contains all... it contained all color. It wasn't a negation of color. It was an acceptance. Because black encompasses all colors. Black is the most aristocratic color of all. The only aristocratic color... I have seen things that were transformed into black, that took on greatness. I don't {{want to use a}} lesser word." [...] In the 1960s she began incorporating white and gold into her works. Nevelson said that white <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> that [...] "summoned the early morning and emotional promise." [...] She described her gold phase as the [...] "baroque phase", inspired by the idea being told as a child that America's streets would be [...] "paved with gold", the materialism and hedonism of the color, the sun, and the moon. Nevelson revisited the Noh robes and the gold coin collections at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for inspiration.|$|E
2500|$|The old fort's {{administrative}} annex, which {{survived the}} construction of Taylor's Customs House, was enlisted as the Presidential offices by Bartolomé Mitre in the 1860s and his successor, Domingo Sarmiento, who beautified the drab building with patios, gardens and wrought-iron grillwork, had the exterior painted pink reportedly in order to defuse political tensions by mixing the red and white colors of the country's two opposing political parties: red <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of the Federales, while white <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>color</b> of the Unitarians. [...] An alternative explanation suggests that the original paint contained cow's blood to prevent damage {{from the effects of}} humidity. Sarmiento also authorized {{the construction of}} the Central Post Office next door in 1873, commissioning Swedish Argentine architect Carl Kihlberg, who designed this, one of the first of Buenos Aires' many examples of Second Empire architecture.|$|E
