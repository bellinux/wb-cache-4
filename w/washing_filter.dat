30|$|It {{was evident}} from the results {{discussed}} above that treated sullage water can be reused for daily activities except for drinking and cooking. Reusing the treated sullage water can give financial benefits to the users. On average, an adult utilize 140  L of water per day in Dhaka [13]. From this 140  L, 30  L is attributed for drinking and toilet/urinal purposes while the remaining 110  L is being used for other daily life activities. Approximately 5  % of the water, around 5.5  L, is lost by evaporation, <b>washing</b> <b>filter</b> media and etc. Thus, the remaining water, after considering drinking, toilet/urinal purposes, and water loss, equates to 104.5  L. Therefore, approximately 75  % [(104.5 / 140)× 100 [*]=[*] 74.64  %] of water can be reused.|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of air {{filtration}} medium made from a hygroscopic polymer fibre and constructed in three layers was investigated to measure the survival and growth of micro-organisms on this medium in comparison to a widely used fibreglass medium. Both materials were supplied by the manufacturer and tested 'blind'. The materials were loaded in an Airotester unit. Micro-organisms were analysed at 2 weekly intervals for 8 weeks by <b>washing</b> <b>filter</b> samples and plating the solution on to agar media and by vital fluorescence microscopy. Filter samples were also weighed to calculate water content and the pH value of the filter material was measured in the wash out eluate. Vital fluorescence microscopy revealed fungi were able to grow on fibreglass medium, {{but not on the}} multi-layered polymer. The colony forming unit (CFU) counts did not increase at a steady rate. There was a significant increase on both materials (P< 0. 001) during the first 2 weeks which was then followed by a significant decrease in 4 weeks (P< 0. 001) but the CFU then significantly increased in 6 weeks (P< 0. 05) which were the highest CFU counts during the 2 -month trial. There was a significant difference in CFU counts between the filter materials only in week 2 (P≤ 0. 001) and week 4 (P= 0. 04). Fewer micro-organisms were extracted from the multi-layered polymer than from the fibreglass medium. Fewer fungal species were identified on the multi-layered polymer (nine species) than on the fibreglass medium (13 species). The pH value on the multi-layered polymer was significantly higher than the fibreglass material but only when clean (P< 0. 010) and after 2 weeks (P< 0. 001). A significantly higher water content on the fibreglass medium (P< 0. 001) also indicated a habitat where a wider range of fungal species and bacteria are able to survive. While there was a reduced survival and growth of micro-organisms on the multi-layered polymer material in the initial month of service life, this advantage was cancelled by the supply of nutrients (particulate matter) that were accumulated on the filter materials after 6 weeks...|$|E

40|$|Flow cytometry (FCM) of {{ventricular}} myocytes (VMs) is {{an emerging}} technology in adult cardiac research that is {{challenged by the}} wide variety of VM shapes and sizes. Cellular variability and cytometer flow cell size can affect cytometer performance. These two factors of variance limit assay validity and reproducibility across laboratories. <b>Washing</b> and <b>filtering</b> of ventricular cells in suspension are routinely done to prevent cell clumping and minimize data variability without the appropriate standardization. We hypothesize that <b>washing</b> and <b>filtering</b> arbitrarily biases towards sampling smaller VMs than what actually exist in the adult heart. To determine the impact of <b>washing</b> and <b>filtering</b> on adult ventricular cells for cell sizing and FCM. Left ventricular cardiac cells in single-cell suspension were harvested from New Zealand White rabbits and fixed prior to analysis. Each ventricular sample was aliquoted before <b>washing</b> or <b>filtering</b> through a 40, 70, 100 or 200 μm mesh. The outcomes of the study are VM volume by Coulter Multisizer and light-scatter signatures by FCM. Data are presented as mean±SD. Myocyte volumes without <b>washing</b> or <b>filtering</b> (NF) served as the "gold standard" within the sample and ranged from 11, 017 to 46, 926 μm 3. Filtering each animal sample through a 200 μm mesh caused no variation in the post-filtration volume (1. 01 + 0. 01 fold vs. NF, n = 4 rabbits, p = 0. 999) with an intra-assay coefficient of variation (%CV) of < 5 % for all 4 samples. Filtering each sample through a 40, 70 or 100 μm mesh invariably reduced the post-filtration volume by 41 ± 10 %, 9. 0 ± 0. 8 % and 8. 8 ± 0. 8 % respectively (n = 4 rabbits, p< 0. 0001), and increased the %CV (18 % to 1. 3 %). The high light-scatter signature by FCM, a simple parameter for the identification of ventricular myocytes, was measured after <b>washing</b> and <b>filtering.</b> <b>Washing</b> discarded VMs and filtering cells through a 40 or 100 μm mesh reduced larger VM by 46 % or 11 % respectively (n = 6 from 2 rabbits, p< 0. 001). <b>Washing</b> and <b>filtering</b> VM suspensions through meshes 100 μm or less biases myocyte volumes to smaller sizes, excludes larger cells, and increases VM variability. These findings indicate that validity and reproducibility across laboratories can be compromised unless cell preparation is standardized. We propose no wash prior to fixation and a 200 μm mesh for filtrations to provide a reproducible standard for VM studies using FCM...|$|R

50|$|The {{appearance}} and size {{range of a}} crystalline product is extremely important in crystallization. If further processing of the crystals is desired, large crystals with uniform size are important for <b>washing,</b> <b>filtering,</b> transportation, and storage, because large crystals are easier to filter out of a solution than small crystals. Also, larger crystals have a smaller surface area to volume ratio, leading to a higher purity. This higher purity is due to less retention of mother liquor which contains impurities, and a smaller loss of yield when the crystals are washed to remove the mother liquor.

40|$|In this work, {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} determine the filterability of calcium carbonate produced with an alternative calcium carbonate production concept. The concept uses steelmaking slag as raw material and has potential to fix CO 2 emissions and utilize steelmaking slag, simultaneously. As calcium carbonate is precipitated in a solution containing ammonium chloride, calcium chloride and ammonia, the product needs to be <b>washed</b> and hence <b>filtered.</b> In this work different separation processes, including <b>washing,</b> <b>filtering</b> and drying, were tested on two calcium carbonate slurries produced from steel converter slag and CO 2 by a laboratory-scale pilot facility, {{with the aim of}} obtaining a solid product with a low chloride content using a minimum amount of washing water. The order of maximum filtration rates achievable of the calcium carbonate slurries was determined by experimental work. The tests included pressure filtration and vacuum filtration and the test series contained altogether 21 different filtration cycles with varying combinations of <b>filtering,</b> <b>washing,</b> and drying steps. The filtered cakes were analyzed by their residual moisture content, chloride content and conductivity, and the filtrates by their residual solids content, chloride content and conductivity. Pressure filtration gave a high capacity (400 - 460 kg/m 2 h) and a low cake residual moisture content (12 - 14 wt-%). Vacuum filtration gave slightly higher filtration rates (500 - 610 kg/m 2 h at the lowest residual chloride contents of the cakes), but the cake residual moisture also stayed higher (25 - 26 wt-%). As the vacuum filtration tests used a filter cloth with higher permeability than that of the pressure filtration tests, a slightly higher filtration rate was expected.

30|$|In {{the second}} step, MACE takes place by adding {{in the same}} beaker 0.12  M of H 2 O 2. The silver-loaded {{clusters}} were left to be etched for a fixed duration. The reaction is exothermic; the solution temperature grew from room temperature to 70 °C. As the etching reactions proceeded, gaseous by-products including hydrogen produced at {{the surface of the}} silver plating induced foaming of the powder. Consequently, most of the powder floated on the solution. This phenomenon has been witnessed earlier at least by four teams[3, 18, 20, 22]. We adopt the same trick used by Loni et al.[20]. Therefore, ethanol was sprayed onto the foam to facilitate subsidence back into the acid solution. Even though this spraying operation was accompanied by a quenching of the reaction, it prevents partial etching of the Si powder. The reaction is practically stopped by adding a subsequent volume of de-ionized water.
