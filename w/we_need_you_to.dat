She landed the vault briefly on both feet, almost instantly hopping onto only her good foot, saluting the judges. She then collapsed onto her knees and needed assistance off the landing platform, to which sportscaster John Tesh commented, [...] "Kerri Strug is hurt! She is hurt badly." [...] The completed vault received score of 9.712, guaranteeing the Americans the gold medal. Károlyi carried her onto the medals podium to join her team, after which she was treated at a hospital for a third-degree lateral sprain and tendon damage. Due to her injury, she was unable to compete in the individual all-around competition and event finals, despite having qualified for both; so Moceanu was chosen to take her place in the all-around, Dawes took her place in the floor final, and Miller took her place in the vault final.|$|E

5000|$|Now {{in these}} troubled times, We find that {{no less than}} the Justice Department of these United States has found that {{institutionalized}} racism has found its way into many municipal courts across the land, making a Jim Crow reality for many black youth preventing them from ever reaching their potential to be as great as their fathers aspired them to be. They are challenged by police as they go about their lives, by I.D. challenges, stop and frisk, [...] black lives matter. This is a fault of not being one of the haves, a poverty in America that is compounded by courts making laws to keep the have-nots in place, forever poor.We should fall back to what made of our generation a black middle class, one that founded the organizations like ours, and be guides and mentors to our lost generation of youth. Civil Service made black wealth a reality for a time, but we got complacent, and 2008 saw the greatest re-distribution of black wealth ever in the form of pension losses, home foreclosures and bankruptcies. Our finest minds have gone on, having done their time striving for better. Their sons and daughters are not part of that America, and for the most part, they are not civil servants. They are Lawyers, Bankers, Business owners and members of Americas elite. The ones that are civil servants, we call on you to join us. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> give of your time, your dollars, your knowledge of Civil Service to the returning veteran, to the students in school, to the parolee just out of our mass incarceration mills and to get them hired. Those salaries are returned to the community because these are our neighbors, our relatives, our brothers and sisters. We know how to do this, and {{it is the only way}} to prevent the cycle of crime, drugs and violence that plagued us in our communities as it did during the crack epidemic of the 90's, and the fires and riots of the 60's.It is imperative that we impart our skills to this problem now, as the older generation withers a gap is forming and the old organizations are dying swiftly. Lets invigorate the tree of liberty with the blood, sweat and tears of a new generation. Call out your fence sitting friends, bring them out and you come out, we need you now to re-build and re-vitalize your communities. Now that you are no longer a Probie, and you have a handle on your finances, join a fraternal organization and give 50 hours a year to mentor youth in test practice classes. Give up 5 hours of overtime a year to shepherd a parolee into a job. Create a better way and lead by going in uniform to schools and showing that we are leaders and people of stature, standing proud of our civil service heritages.|$|E

5000|$|After {{telling the}} police {{dispatcher}} that Martin [...] "ran", Zimmerman left his vehicle on Twin Trees {{and walked down}} the sidewalk between Twin Trees and Retreat View Circle to determine his location and ascertain in which direction Martin had fled. The dispatcher asked if Zimmerman was following Martin, and Zimmerman replied [...] "Yeah." [...] Then the dispatcher said, [...] "OK, <b>we</b> don't <b>need</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do that."

According to Zimmerman, Martin then punched him in the face, knocking him down, and began beating his head against the sidewalk. Zimmerman said he called out for help while being beaten, and at one point Martin covered his mouth to muffle the screams. According to Zimmerman's father, during the struggle while Martin was on top of Zimmerman, Martin saw the gun Zimmerman was carrying and said something to the effect of [...] "You're gonna die now" [...] or [...] "You're gonna die tonight" [...] and continued to beat Zimmerman. Zimmerman and Martin struggled over the gun, and Zimmerman shot Martin once in the chest at close range. Zimmerman told police he shot Martin in self-defense.|$|R

5000|$|In 1986, the Tribune {{announced}} that celebrated film critic Gene Siskel, the Tribunes best-known writer, {{was no longer}} the paper's film critic, and that his position with the paper had shifted from being that of a full-time film critic to that of a free-lance contract writer who was to write about the film industry for the Sunday paper and also provide capsule film reviews for the paper's entertainment sections. The demotion occurred after Siskel and longtime Chicago film critic colleague Roger Ebert decided to shift the production of their weekly movie-review show—then known as At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert and later known as Siskel & Ebert & The Movies—from Tribune Entertainment to The Walt Disney Company's Buena Vista Television unit. [...] "He has done a great job for us," [...] editor James Squires said at the time. [...] "It's a question of how much a person can do physically. <b>We</b> think <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be a newspaper person first, and Gene Siskel has always tried to do that. But there comes a point when a career is so big that you can't do that." [...] Siskel {{declined to comment on the}} new arrangement, but Ebert publicly criticized Siskel's Tribune bosses for punishing Siskel for taking their television program to a company other than Tribune Entertainment. Siskel remained in that free-lance position until his death in 1999. He was replaced as film critic in 1986 by Dave Kehr.|$|R
40|$|Three {{objectives}} of the National Block and Bridle Club are to promote animal agriculture through {{the activities of the}} club, to supplement students’ study of the animal sciences, and to bring about a closer relationship among students who choose {{to be a part of}} the organization. I believe the Block and Bridle club at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln has been successful in accomplishing these goals over the past year and I sincerely thank all of the officers and members who have given their time and effort to make this possible. I am excited to say that our active membership has increased over the past school year and I hope to see this trend continue as we strive to make decisions that will benefit each member of the club. I also thank the Animal Science faculty and staff who provide support and guidance both in regard to the club and on an individual basis. I am grateful for the opportunity to interact with faculty who are willing to make a personal investment in students; I believe this is one of the many benefits of being part of the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the East Campus community at UNL. I especially thank our advisors, Dr. Gary Sullivan, Dr. Ty Schmidt, and Brad Bennett, for encouraging our new ideas, working with us to plan and execute events, answering our many questions, and being available for anything else <b>we</b> <b>needed.</b> Thank <b>you</b> <b>to</b> Terri Behl for always working with us to distribute clothing, collect payments, print programs, and much more. Over the past three years, Block and Bridle has provided me with the chance to learn from leaders who are passionate about many different sectors of the agricultural industry, to teach younger students about livestock production, and to meet people with a common interest, some of whom have become great friends. It is my hope that throughout this year, members have gained experiences and relationships that are meaningful to them and will continue to do so in coming years. Again, thank <b>you</b> <b>to</b> all members, officers, and advisors for your dedication to Block and Bridle and your contributions that made this year a success. I thank you for allowing me to serve as your 2014 – 2015 President and I look forward to being a part of the officer team again next year.
