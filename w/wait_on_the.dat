5|$|Beckwith mustered 6,700 {{men from}} a variety of garrisons and sources, his men {{belonging}} to the 3rd, 4th, 6th and 8th West India Regiments, the 1st Foot, 15th Foot, 19th Foot, 25th Foot, 63rd Foot, 90th Foot and the Royal York Rangers, as well as 300 garrison artillerymen and various militia forces. These troops were split into two divisions: the largest, 3,700 men under Beckwith with subordinate command given to Major General Thomas Hislop, was to be deployed at Le Gosier on the island's southern shore. The second division, 2,450 men under Brigadier General George Harcourt, was initially ordered to <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Îles des Saintes before being deployed after the main attack {{to the rear of the}} French garrison. A small reserve under Brigadier General Charles Wale would follow the main assault to provide support if required. As the French had no significant naval resources on the island, the Royal Navy's contribution was much smaller than that required for the Martinique invasion the year before. Cochrane attached ships of the line to both divisions, Beckwith sailing in Cochrane's flagship HMS Pompee, accompanied by HMS Abercrombie with Commodore William Charles Fahie, while Harcourt sailed with Commodore Samuel James Ballard in HMS Sceptre. Ballard and Fahie were in command of the transports and smaller vessels that carried the invasion forces and bore responsibility for ensuring that the amphibious landings were successful as well as for any naval units that participated in the land campaign.|$|E

25|$|An early {{problem for}} the escapees was that most were unable to find {{the way into the}} railway station, until {{daylight}} revealed it was in a recess of the side wall to an underground pedestrian tunnel. Consequently, many of them missed their night time trains, and decided either to walk across country or <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> platform in daylight. Another unanticipated problem was that this was the coldest March for thirty years, with snow up to five feet deep, so the escapees had no option but to leave the cover of woods and fields and stay on the roads.|$|E

25|$|Just as some prey species evolved cryptic {{colouration}} {{and patterns}} to help avoid predators, some ambush predators evolved camouflage that lets them ambush their prey. The tassled scorpionfish is an ambush predator {{that looks like}} part of a sea floor encrusted with coral and algae. It lies in <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sea floor for crustaceans and small fish, such as gobies, to pass by. Another ambush predator is the striated frogfish (right). They lie {{on the bottom and}} wave a conspicuous worm-like lure strategically attached above their mouth. Normally about 10cm (4in) long, they can also inflate themselves like puffers.|$|E
25|$|The line's railway {{signaling}} {{system is designed}} to ensure that trains <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> double track section while a train is proceeding {{in the other direction}} on the single track. The signal system was upgraded in the 1990s to support Metrolink commuter rail services, and Richard Stanger, the executive director of Metrolink in its early years of 1991 to 1998, said the system had functioned without trouble in the past. The Metrolink train would normally wait in the Chatsworth station for the daily Union Pacific freight train to pass before proceeding, unless the freight train was already waiting for it at Chatsworth. The location was not protected by catch points.|$|E
25|$|Alfonso VI {{seems to}} have lost {{patience}} {{with the state of}} diocesan affairs in Coimbra and had secured the election of a new bishop at Eastertime of 1091. The new bishop, Cresconius, was the former abbot of Saint Bartholomew of Tui and was essentially a royal choice. He was consecrated by the archbishop of Toledo {{with the assistance of the}} bishops of Tui and Ourense. The participation of these latter, as well as later events, suggests that Cresconius would have been acceptable to Raymond of Burgundy also. But the consecration and installation of the royal candidate at Coimbra may have had to <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> death of Sisnando.|$|E

During the night the Glosters' A and D Companies were attacked, and by 07:30 A Company, outnumbered six to one, had been forced from its position on Castle Hill. An attempt to retake it failed, during which Lieutenant Philip Curtis single-handedly destroyed an enemy machine-gun position, for which he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} incident, on August 13, 1992, the same vessel {{pulled out of}} its berth at the Departure Bay {{terminal}} while vehicle loading ramps were still lowered and resting on the ship. Three people were killed, including two children, one was seriously injured, and two others received minor injuries when a van from Alberta containing 6 people fell 15 m (about 50ft) from the upper deck onto the lower car deck and finally into the sea below. The van had been stopped and instructed to <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> loading ramp by terminal crew members. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada determined that the accident {{was caused by the}} vessel not properly following departing procedures and secondarily due to poor communication between terminal and ship crew members.|$|E
25|$|The Revolution in Haiti did not <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Revolution in France. The {{individuals}} in Haiti relied on no other resolution but their own. The call for modification of society {{was influenced by}} the revolution in France, but once the hope for change found a place in the hearts of the Haitian people, there was no stopping the radical reformation that was occurring. The Enlightenment ideals and the initiation of the French Revolution were enough to inspire the Haitian Revolution, which evolved into the most successful and comprehensive slave rebellion. Just as the French were successful in transforming their society, so were the Haitians. On April 4, 1792, The French National Assembly granted freedom to slaves in Haiti and the revolution culminated in 1804; Haiti was an independent nation solely of freed peoples. The activities of the revolutions sparked change across the world. France's transformation was most influential in Europe, and Haiti's influence spanned across every location that continued to practice slavery. John E. Baur honors Haiti as home of the most influential Revolution in history.|$|E

25|$|After {{the males}} have arrived to the beach, the females arrive to give birth. Females fast {{for five weeks}} and nurse their single pup for four weeks; {{in the last few}} days of lactation, females come into estrus and mate. In this {{polygynous}} society, a high-ranking bull can have a harem of 30–100 cows, depending on his size and strength. Males unable to establish harems will <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> periphery, and will try to mount nearby females. Dominant bulls will disrupt copulations of lower-ranking bulls. They can mount females without interference, but commonly break off to chase off rivals. While fights are not usually to the death, they are brutal and often with significant bloodshed and injury; however, in many cases of mismatched opponents, the younger, less capable males are simply chased away, often to upland dunes. In a lifetime, a successful bull could easily sire over 500 pups. Most copulations in a breeding colony are done by only a small number of males and the rest may never be able to mate with a female. Pups are sometimes crushed during battles between bulls.|$|E
25|$|Beowulf {{returns home}} and {{eventually}} becomes king {{of his own}} people. One day, fifty years after Beowulf's battle with Grendel's mother, a slave steals a golden cup from the lair of a dragon at Earnanæs. When the dragon sees that the cup has been stolen, it leaves its cave in a rage, burning everything in sight. Beowulf and his warriors come to fight the dragon, but Beowulf tells his men that he will fight the dragon alone {{and that they should}} <b>wait</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> barrow. Beowulf descends to do battle with the dragon, but finds himself outmatched. His men, upon seeing this and fearing for their lives, retreat into the woods. One of his men, Wiglaf, however, in great distress at Beowulf's plight, comes to his aid. The two slay the dragon, but Beowulf is mortally wounded. After Beowulf dies, Wiglaf remains by his side, grief-stricken. When the rest of the men finally return, Wiglaf bitterly admonishes them, blaming their cowardice for Beowulf's death. Afterward, Beowulf is ritually burned on a great pyre in Geatland while his people wail and mourn him, fearing that without him, the Geats are defenceless against attacks from surrounding tribes. Afterwards, a barrow, visible from the sea, is built in his memory. (Beowulf lines 2712–3182).|$|E
