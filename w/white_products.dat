50|$|PSYOP {{involves}} the careful creation {{and dissemination of}} a product message. There are three types of products {{that are used to}} create these messages.

White, Gray, and Black don't refer to the product's content but rather the methods used to carry out the operation.|$|E
50|$|By 1921, Flickinger’s success {{had grown}} into a small chain of Red & White stores {{throughout}} upstate New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio, while simultaneously supplying other independent stores with Red & <b>White</b> <b>products</b> through his warehouse. This collection of Red & White stores and independent stores became the Red & White stores Voluntary Group System. Membership to the group included site selection, training, discounted store fixtures and professional window display for initial store openings to help avoid the failure of thousands of corner grocers.|$|E

50|$|As one {{who helped}} shape the grocery {{industry}} into what it is today, Albrecht {{was a man who}} valued simple solutions and easy-to-execute programs. He also understood the economic, political and technological changes taking place throughout his career. He knew that during a time of when food prices were on the rise, he had to eliminate every frill from the “Red & White Corporation” to promise the lowest possible cost of Red & <b>White</b> <b>products</b> to Federated’s customers. The brand was a hit. And Albrecht realized soon after that if Federated owned more brands, then it could grow and, at the same time, help grocers who desired a private label program but lacked the capacity to develop one. So throughout the 1960s, Federated acquired the Hy-Top and Parade brands under Albrecht’s leadership.|$|E

In particular, we compute the <b>white</b> <b>product</b> of the operads Lie and As (governing the varieties of Lie and associative algebras, respectively).

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports a}} method for {{producing}} α-Al 2 O 3 at low temperature using a seeding technique. A <b>white</b> <b>product</b> obtained by hydrolyzing aluminum isopropoxide in water at 80 °C was peptized using acetic acid at 80 °C, which transformed the <b>white</b> <b>product</b> to a transparent alumina sol. α-Al 2 O 3 particles {{were added to the}} alumina sol as seed material; the sol containing α-Al 2 O 3 particles was then transformed to an α-Al 2 O 3 -seeded alumina gel by drying the sol at room temperature. The non-seeded alumina gel remained boehmite after annealing at 300 °C and crystallized into γ-Al 2 O 3 and α-Al 2 O 3 at temperatures between 300 and 500 °C and between 900 and 1100 °C, respectively. The α-Al 2 O 3 seeding promoted crystallization of the alumina gel into α-Al 2 O 3. The promotion of crystallization was significant with an increase in α-Al 2 O 3 particle content by weight in the final seeded alumina gel. With an α-Al 2 O 3 particle content of 5 %, the seeded alumina gel was partially crystallized into α-Al 2 O 3 by annealing at a temperature as low as 900 °C...|$|R

40|$|Although {{egg white}} {{is known as}} expressing {{efficient}} antimicrobial properties under physiological conditions, little is known on the microbial quality of industrial egg white. This issue is of great importance when egg white enters into the composition of highly perishable products, such as chilled egg-based desserts. Due to the high thermo-sensitivity of its constitutive proteins, liquid egg white is stabilized at low heat-treating times and temperatures (2 to 6 min at 55 °C to 57 °C in France). The remaining of heat-resisting bacteria may shorten the shelf-life of the desserts, with damaging health and economical consequences. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the microbial quality of raw and pasteurized liquid egg <b>white</b> <b>products</b> collected in a French company at two consecutive warm and cold seasons. A total of 63 samples were analyzed, including 30 raw and 33 pasteurized (at 57 °C for 6 min) liquid egg <b>white</b> <b>products.</b> The level and type of bacterial contamination was evaluated by pour-plating in PCA (incubation for 24 h at 30 °C under aerobic conditions) and 16 SrDNA sequencing of the colonies. The average counts were fairly low and a broad range of population was highlighted from one sample to another, namely 1. 7 ± 1. 6 log CFU/m...|$|E

We show that taking replicators is in Koszul dual to taking successors in [3] for binary quadratic operads and is equivalent to taking the <b>white</b> <b>product</b> with certain operads such as Perm.

30|$|In {{a typical}} {{synthesis}} procedure, an amorphous carbon film was first sputtered on a single-crystal Si wafer (1 0 0) in spraying etching instrument (SCD 050, Faraday Technology, Clayton, OH, USA). Secondly, the resulting silicon substrate was loaded to an alumina crucible boat, placed inside a quartz tube furnace. After the furnace was evacuated to 10 - 3 Torr, H 2 (5 %)/N 2 mixed gas flow was kept through the tube {{at the rate}} of 2, 000 sccm. The crucible was heated up to 1, 200 °C with a ramping rate of 15 °C/min. After being maintained in 1, 200 °C for 4 h, the furnace was naturally cooled down to room temperature, and <b>white</b> <b>products</b> (later found to be Si-O-N nanowires) were found on the Si wafer.|$|E

Chemical composition analysis was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Shimadzu/Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD, Kratos Analytical, Chestnut Ridge, NY, USA), equipped with a standard and monochromatic source (Al Kα) operated at 150 W. The optical reflectivity of these nanowires was also studied using a Datacolor Elrepho photospectrometer (Datacolor ELREPHO, Lawrenceville, NJ, USA), and their photoluminescence (PL) measurement was conducted at room temperature using an FP- 6500 with Xenon lamp line (Jasco, Essex, UK) of 258 nm as the excitation source.|$|E

The characterization methods were used: differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, tensile test, swelling test, thermooxidative test. The composition of both materials, including fillers and others additives is almost the same but difference is in structure of EPDM and probably also in interaction with fillers, what exhibits different mechanical properties, thermooxidative stability and thermal capacity.
