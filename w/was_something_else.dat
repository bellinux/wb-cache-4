25|$|I {{bought my}} first copy in 1968 – a small, fat bundle of Pelican {{with a picture}} of a Yorkshire miner on the front – and I still have it, bandaged up and {{exhausted}} by the years of labour. From the first of its 900-odd pages, I knew, and my friends at the University of Sussex knew, that this <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> We talked about it in the bar and on the bus and in the refectory queue. Imagine that: young male students more interested in a book than in gooseberry tart and custard.|$|E
500|$|A statue by {{sculptor}} Jocelyn Russell of Reckless carrying ammunition {{shells and}} other combat equipment was unveiled on July 26, 2013, in Semper Fidelis Memorial Park at the National Museum of the Marine Corps, {{one day before}} the 60th anniversary of the Korean War. There is a lock of her tail hair {{in the base of}} the statue. The statue's plaque includes a quote from Sergeant Harold Wadley, who served in battle alongside Sergeant Reckless: [...] "The spirit of her loneliness and her loyalty, in spite of the danger, <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> to behold. Hurting. Determined. And alone. That's the image I have imprinted in my head and heart forever." ...|$|E

500|$|The Beatles {{undertook}} {{the recording}} of Abbey Road {{with a sense of}} discipline and cooperation that had largely been absent while making the White Album and Let It Be. Having temporarily left the group in January 1969 {{partly as a result of}} McCartney's criticism of his musicianship, Harrison exhibited a greater level of assertiveness regarding his place in the band, particularly while they worked on his compositions [...] "Something" [...] and [...] "Here Comes the Sun". In addition, like Lennon and McCartney, Martin had come to fully appreciate Harrison as a songwriter, later saying: [...] "I first recognised that he really had a great talent when we did 'Here Comes the Sun.' But when he brought in 'Something,' it <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>else...</b> It was a tremendous work – and so simple." ...|$|E

2500|$|All {{four members}} of Led Zeppelin have agreed that [...] "Kashmir" [...] {{is one of their}} best musical achievements. John Paul Jones {{suggested}} that it showcases all of the elements that made up the Led Zeppelin sound. Plant has stated that [...] "Kashmir" [...] is the [...] "definitive Led Zeppelin song", and that it [...] "was one of my favourite [...] Zeppelin tracks because it possessed all the latent energy and power that wasn't heavy metal. It <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> It was the pride of Led Zeppelin." [...] During a television interview in January 2008, he also named [...] "Kashmir" [...] as his first choice of all Led Zeppelin songs that he would perform, commenting [...] "I'm most proud of that one". [...] Page has indicated he thinks that the song is one of the band's best compositions.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Fourth Lateran Council, {{the civil}} and common law courts quickly moved to ban trial by ordeal and trial by combat. Implementation {{proved to be}} more difficult. [...] What would take their place? [...] The novel choice was trial by jury. [...] In many places this change was seen as radical, and was met with great doubts about its effectiveness. [...] There was {{reluctance}} to accept juries on a large scale by many of the English courts, and the public at large. [...] People were used to a system where decisions were made by the outcome of a duel or an ordeal. [...] The jury system had made a sporadic appearance in England from time to time, including, but not limited to Danelaw and the Saxons. Even so, juries had never been predominant. [...] A jury remained a local and obscure phenomenon. [...] It was generally believed that God's will was revealed in the outcome of the battle or ordeal. [...] The fact that the judge would view the result of the ordeal and declare [...] "God's decision" [...] had little bearing on the validity of the procedure. The jury <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> It did not represent God and its twelve or more members were likely to fail to deliver God's solution.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the facts that Nat King Cole had the #7 song in 1959, and the #1 song in 1921, and Chuck Berry had a major hit with [...] "Maybellene" [...] in 1955, in the United States in the 1950s legal {{segregation}} and discrimination against African Americans was common, especially in the Deep South. Presley would nevertheless publicly cite his debt to African American music, pointing to artists such as B. B. King, Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup, Ivory Joe Hunter, and Fats Domino. The reporter who conducted Presley's first interview in New York City in 1956 noted that he named blues singers who [...] "obviously {{meant a lot to}} him. [...] was very surprised to hear him talk about the black performers down there and about how he tried to carry on their music." [...] Later that year in Charlotte, North Carolina, Presley was quoted as saying: [...] "The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I’m doin' now, man, for more years than I know. They played it like that in their shanties and in their juke joints and nobody paid it no mind 'til I goosed it up. I got it from them. Down in Tupelo, Mississippi, I used to hear old Arthur Crudup bang his box the way I do now and I said if I ever got to a place I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] Little Richard said of Presley: [...] "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music." [...] B. B. King said he began to respect Presley after he did Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup material and that after he met him, he thought the singer really <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> and was someone whose music was growing all the time right up to his death.|$|E
