2500|$|The {{national}} British {{signs were}} now a red disc (prohibition), a red open triangle (warning/hazard), a red ring (an order), {{and a red}} open triangle in a ring for the new (1933) warning with order 'SLOW - MAJOR ROAD AHEAD' and 'HALT AT MAJOR ROAD AHEAD' plates (the predecessors of 'GIVE WAY' and 'STOP' respectively). All signs were to carry information plates mounted below them, the warnings or hazards being illustrated {{with a wide range}} of prescribed symbols, but with a text panel below, being only text where no symbol existed. Lettering and symbols were black on a white ground except for orders (like 'TURN LEFT') which were white on blue. New to the UK were the first combination sign, which incorporated information on the sign itself, the 30 miles per hour speed restriction (introduced in 1934), with '30' in black letters on a white disc (the information) surrounded by a red ring (the order sign). It was accompanied by its 'derestriction' a white disc with a diagonal black band bisecting it. Neither of these signs required separate information plates. The 1934 RTA also clarified direction and distance signage which also remained in that form until 1964. All signs were mounted on posts painted in black and white stripes, and their reverse sides were finished black, green, or more rarely (usually after repainting) white. The 'HALT' plate was unique in being T-shaped; orders were mainly landscape and warnings always portrait. Sizes were strictly prescribed, the <b>warning</b> <b>plate</b> being [...] with the surmounting triangle [...] equal.|$|E

50|$|Hazchem is a <b>warning</b> <b>plate</b> {{system used}} in Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom for {{vehicles}} transporting hazardous substances, and on storage facilities. The top-left {{section of the}} plate gives the Emergency Action Code (EAC) telling the fire brigade what actions to take if there's an accident. The middle-left section gives the UN Substance Identification Number describing the chemical. The lower-left section gives the telephone number that should be called if special advice is needed. The warning symbol at top-right indicates what danger the chemical presents. The bottom-right of the plate carries a company logo (the flower is a sample logo).|$|E
50|$|The craft’s {{raked bow}} made {{beaching}} comparatively easy, and the craft came off without difficulty when unloaded, {{though it could}} snag on rocks or poor ground as any other small boat would. The LCP(L) could be loaded from the boat deck, before launching, ‘unless otherwise specified by the <b>warning</b> <b>plate</b> in the boat’, for its construction as much as its light weight made this speeding up of the launching-load time possible. Other craft, especially those with a ramp like the LCV and LCVP were structurally weak in the bow {{and could not be}} loaded before lowering from davits; personnel being transported in these types climbed down scramble nets into these boat.|$|E

30|$|The {{simplest}} description for passive type LXs {{may be all}} LXs {{equipped with}} any <b>warning</b> signs, <b>plates,</b> devices, or any other protection equipment, which is permanent and independent of any traffic situation. The first analysis of operational LX risk was carried out {{on the basis of}} the active and passive LX types as defined per the European Railway Agency for the purpose of defining Common Safety Indicators [3]. It defines an active LX as a LX where the crossing users are protected from, or warned of, the approaching train by the activation of devices when it is unsafe for the user to cross the LX. In the case of an automatic active LX (A. 1 in Fig.  1), these devices are activated by the approaching train. Manual active LXs (A. 2) are activated by humans when there is no railway signal interlocked with control train movements. In the case of passive LX (B in Fig.  1) there is no warning system and/or protection system showing when it is unsafe for the user to cross the LX. SELCAT project [2, 4] carried out an analysis of accident statistics by comparing operational risk according to the different LX types. As a basis for comparison, seven basic LX types as defined per ERA were taken into account. The individual risk for road LX user was compared as per the different LX types [5].|$|R
25|$|An {{experiment}} of 1932 was {{the addition}} of a stamp vending machine {{to the end of the}} post box. This necessitated an oval planform for the box even though it was only provided with a single posting aperture. At one end of the oval is the stamp machine and at the other is the posting aperture. The boxes have two doors; one for clearance of mail and one for emptying the cash and reloading the stamp machines. The machines were set to vend two halfpenny stamps in exchange for one old penny, the stamps being supplied in a long continuously wound roll known as a coil. Boxes were again made in two sizes, designated Type D and Type E, and carried raised lettering on the castings indicating the position of the stamp vending machine, as well as an array of small enamel <b>plates</b> <b>warning</b> users of the danger of bent coins and the need to wait for stamps to be issued before inserting more money. Several of each have survived in use in England and in the Isle of Man.|$|R
40|$|Two {{independent}} studies, each employing 12 subjects {{sitting in}} a stationary car on an unused airport runway with low beams on, were conducted to determine the distance at which a shape coded, reflector-ized <b>warning</b> <b>plate</b> can be recognized at night {{as a function of}} target brightness. Recognition distances were recorded for a balanced combi-nation of 15 experimental conditions consisting of 3 different spe-cific intensity levels of target brightness (high 1080 cd/fc/sq ft at. 2 degrees observation angle and- 4 degrees entrance angle; medium 305 cd/fc/sq ft and low 105 cd/fc/sq ft) and 5 different shapes of equal area (18 square inches) targets (rectangle, circle, square, triangle, octagon). Study 1 used a car heading angle of 10 degrees to the right while Study 2 used a car heading angle of- 3 degrees to the left. Results of these studies indicated that increasing target brightness had either no effect or only a small effect on target recognition dis-tance, and the triangle (the object with the longest sides) was recog-nized at the largest distance and with the fewest errors. Targets were also recognized further away at the 10 degree car heading angle (less beam illumination) than at the- 3 degree car heading angle (near maximum beam illumination). Implications of these results for the design and display of shape coded reflectorized warning plates in both traffic and industrial settings are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{report the}} roadkill of a jaguar {{in one of}} the longest {{highways}} in Brazil (BR- 101), in the stretch where this road crosses {{one of the most important}} Atlantic Forest remnants in the country: the Linhares-Sooretama block. The jaguar population present in this area represents the very last in entire Espírito Santo state. There is an approved project to the lines duplication of the entire BR- 101 Highway and the company responsible by the work has already started the first activities in the state. However, there is no environmental impact assessment already done neither planning for the implementation of measures to avoid or reduce the roadkill risk in the region. Thus, to minimize the impacts associated with the BR- 101, we do not recommend its lines duplication along the 15 km stretch traversing the Linhares-Sooretama block. In addition, alternatively, we suggest the deviation of the current route of the BR- 101 Highway or the construction of overpasses to fauna in the most critical points, interspersing these overpasses with electronic speed monitoring devices and <b>warning</b> and educational <b>plates...</b>|$|R

5000|$|On August 27, 2000, Valdéz was {{pitching}} for the Dodgers and was {{ejected from}} a game {{after he was}} accused of retaliating and throwing pitches at the head of Cubs first baseman Mark Grace. The incident began {{in the top of the}} fifth inning when Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood yielded the second of two home runs to the Dodgers' Bruce Aven. Wood then threw a pitch close to the next batter, Alex Cora, on the first pitch after Aven's second home run. Wood denied that he was trying to hit Cora, but in the bottom of the fifth, Valdes came close to hitting Grace on the first pitch, drawing a <b>warning</b> from home <b>plate</b> umpire Mark Wegner. Then, four pitches later, Valdéz hit Grace on the shoulder, and was ejected. [...] In September, Frank Robinson, major league baseball's head of on-field discipline, suspended Valdéz for six games and fined him $1,000 for the incident. [...] Valdes initially appealed, but several days later dropped his appeal and began serving his suspension.|$|R
30|$|Stylistic text can {{be found}} on sign boards, street and {{organizations}} boards and logos, bulletin boards, announcements, advertisements, dangerous goods <b>plates,</b> <b>warning</b> notices, etc. In stylistic text images, text-lines within an image may have different orientations such as curved in shape or not be parallel to each other. As a result, extraction and subsequent recognition of individual text-lines and words in such images is a difficult task. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for straightening of curved text-lines using the concept of dilation, flood-fill, robust thinning, and B-spline curve-based fitting. In the proposed scheme, at first, dilation is applied on individual text-lines to cover the area within a certain boundary. Next, thinning is applied to get the path of the text, approximate the path using the B-spline, find the angle between the normal at a point on the curve and the vertical line, and finally visit each point on the text and rotate by their corresponding angles. The proposed methodology is tested on variety of text images containing text-lines in Devanagari, English, and Chinese scripts which is evaluated on the basis of visual perception and the mean square error (MSE) calculation. MSE is calculated by line fitting applied on input and output images. On the basis of evaluation results obtained in our experiments, the proposed method is promising.|$|R
