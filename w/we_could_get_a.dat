Explaining why the American Health Care Act (the House Republicans' bill to repeal and replace for the Affordable Care Act) failed in March 2017, Barton said, [...] "Sometimes you’re playing fantasy football and sometimes you’re {{in the real}} game. We knew the president, if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> repeal bill to his desk, would almost certainly veto it. This time we knew if {{it got to the}} president’s desk it would be signed.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Nintendo was {{concerned}} that a CD-ROM drive would increase {{the cost of the}} console in a price-sensitive market. Nintendo software engineering manager Jim Merrick said, [...] "We're very sensitive to the cost of the console. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> eight-speed CD-ROM mechanism in the unit, but in the under-$200 console market, {{it would be hard to}} pull that off." ...|$|R

'No doubt <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> {{order from}} the Court,' said the attorney, {{thinking}} that anything might be fairly said in such an emergency as this; 'but {{it will be better}} that she should come of her own accord, or by his direction.

In this paper, we attempt at a velocity operator approach to a 3 D NP system. Following Sunakawa, after introducing momentum density operators, we define velocity operators, denoting classical fluid velocities. We derive a collective Hamiltonian {{in terms of the}} collective variables. Comment: 10 pages, no figures, Publication versio...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} Memetic Algorithm for solving {{timetabling}} problems. We present a new memetic algorithm {{which consists of}} global search algorithm and local search algorithm. In the proposed method, a genetic algorithm is chosen for global search algorithm while a simulated annealing algorithm is used for local search algorithm. In particular, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> optimal solution through the. NET with the real data of JiangXi Normal University. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed algorithm can solve the university exam timetabling problem efficiently. </p...|$|R

[...] Describing the final choice of proprietary floppy disks instead of CD-ROM, Nintendo game designer Shigesato Itoi explained, [...] "CD holds a lot of data, DD holds a moderate amount of data and backs the data up, and [...] ROMs hold the least data and process the fastest. By attaching a DD to the game console, we can drastically increase the number of possible genres." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Maintenance {{plays an}} {{important}} role in keeping the availability of civilian and military equipments at a satisfactory level. The issue, which decision maker is most concerned about, is how to keep the availability at a satisfactory level with less maintenance cost. In this study, we propose a simulation-optimization approach to spare parts allocation based on decision-maker’s satisfaction. Firstly, multi-echelon Spare Parts Management System is systematically studied. Then based on the two-echelon simulation model, the two objectives, operational availability and maintenance cost of the spare parts, are evaluated with fuzzy multi-objective optimization, which are expressed by a objective function: decision-maker’s satisfaction. At last, by using this simulation-optimization method, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> optimized allocation...|$|R
