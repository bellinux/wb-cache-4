5|$|Gliese 876 b {{currently}} {{lies beyond}} {{the outer edge}} of the habitable zone but because Gliese 876 is a slowly evolving main-sequence red dwarf its habitable zone is very slowly moving outwards and <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so for trillions of years. Therefore, Gliese 876 b will, in trillions of years time, lie inside Gliese 876's habitable zone, as defined by the ability of an Earth-mass planet to retain liquid water at its surface, and remain there for at least 4.6 billion years. While the prospects for life on a gas giant are unknown, large moons may be able to support a habitable environment. Models of tidal interactions between a hypothetical moon, the planet and the star suggest that large moons should be able to survive in orbit around Gliese 876 b for the lifetime of the system. On the other hand, it is unclear whether such moons could form in the first place. However, the large mass of the gas giant may make it more likely for larger moons to form.|$|E

40|$|Research Question: Does the {{pharmacy}} market seem {{to change in}} accordance with the goals stipulated by the government due to the reregulation? This leads to the following sub-questions: Does it seem like the availability of medical drugs for consumers increase? Does it seem like service for consumers get enhanced? Does it seem like the supply of services for consumers increase? Does it seem like the costs of medical drugs are maintained? Purpose: The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate if the trends resulting from the reregulation of {{the pharmacy}} monopoly correspond to the goals stipulated by the government. The purpose is furthermore to compare the reregulation of other Swedish markets and the reregulation of the pharmacy market in other Nordic countries in order to heed their lessons. Method: This study uses method triangulation, with a questionnaire directed to pharmacy customers forming the quantitative basis and interviews with specialists regarding the pharmacy market, forming the qualitative. The study also draws heavily on historic data regarding reregulation of Swedish markets and reregulation of the pharmacy market in other Nordic countries. Conclusions: Availability of medical drugs has increased and <b>will</b> presumably <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.   Service quality has increased somewhat and <b>will</b> presumably <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Supply of services has increased and it <b>will</b> presumably <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.

After they make camp for the night, the manifestation of Rumplestiltskin tries to guide Emma into betraying Merida once they reach {{the home of the}} wisps. The manifestation of Rumplestiltskin tells Emma that once Merida speaks into the Wisp, it <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> her bidding until she dies, and thus, the only solution would then be for Emma to kill her. Merida overhears the conversation, and sneaks off to the Hill of Stones by herself. Emma catches up with her in the morning and is goaded by Rumplestiltskin's manifestation, against her better judgment and good nature, to rip Merida's heart out. Before Emma can crush the heart, Hook appears with the others and stops her. Once everything has settled down, Mary Margaret hands Emma the dagger; however, Emma, believing that carrying the dagger would give her too much power, wants someone else to possess it. She decides to give the dagger to Regina, since she would be the only one capable of killing Emma if necessary. Moments later, King Arthur and some of his knights arrive on horseback in order to proclaim that they have been awaiting Emma's arrival. Arthur believes that Emma will be able to reunite them with Merlin, and everyone involved joins forces on their quest en route to Camelot.|$|E
