5|$|A long-standing trustee {{and former}} Vice-President of the World Wide Fund for Nature International, Prince Sadruddin led Bellerive's support for {{threatened}} species. Bellerive was also amongst the first organisations to <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> the potential human health hazards of modern intensive farming methods.|$|E
5|$|The sonorous {{sound of}} the bell was also used to <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> {{impending}} typhoons and as a general alert. Because the ringing of a temple bell could be heard over considerable distances, it was also sometimes used for other signalling purposes; there are records of temple bells being used for military communication from {{as far back as}} the Genpei War (1180–1185 CE). Smaller versions were subsequently cast for battlefield use, as the large temple bells were too heavy and unwieldy to transport. These smaller bonshō were used primarily as alarms to <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> enemy attacks; commands were given using drums and conches.|$|E
5|$|When {{the plans}} were first {{announced}} the county surveyor raised no objections, {{and it was}} not until October 1943 and onwards that the Ministry of Town and Country Planning began to increasingly <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> the opposition that was bound to arise against the scheme.|$|E

60|$|Sophie was solemnly warned and {{instructed}} {{by all the}} mothers and aunts,--she was <b>warned</b> <b>of</b> moths, <b>warned</b> <b>of</b> cockroaches, <b>warned</b> <b>of</b> flies, <b>warned</b> <b>of</b> dust; all the articles of furniture had their covers, made of cold Holland linen, in which they looked like bodies laid out,--even the curtain tassels had each its little shroud,--and bundles of receipts, and of rites and ceremonies necessary for the preservation and purification and care of all these articles, were stuffed into the poor girl's head, before guiltless of cares as the feathers that floated above it.|$|R
50|$|<b>Warning</b> <b>Of</b> Danger is {{the second}} studio album of the American heavy metal band Omen. It was {{originally}} released in 1985 by Metal Blade. In 1989 Metal Blade re-released <b>Warning</b> <b>Of</b> Danger with the EP Nightmares as bonus tracks.|$|R
5|$|By 2009 {{some of the}} {{conditions}} required for a currency war had returned, with a severe economic downturn seeing global trade in that year decline by about 12%. There was a widespread concern among advanced economies {{about the size of}} their deficits; they increasingly joined emerging economies in viewing export led growth as their ideal strategy. In March 2009, even before international co-operation reached its peak with the 2009 G-20 London Summit , economist Ted Truman {{became one of the first}} to <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> the dangers of competitive devaluation. He also coined the phrase competitive non-appreciation.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, in {{response}} to a major new road building programme and expansion of aviation, a delegation of road protest veterans visited the Department for Transport to <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> renewed direct action {{in response}}, delivering a D-lock {{as a symbol of the}} past protests. One such protestor, Rebecca Lush Blum went on to found Road Block to support road protesters and challenge the government. In 2007, Road Block became a project within the Campaign for Better Transport. The M11 Link road protests inspired the launch of Undercurrents the video activism organisation. Training activists to film the protests they released - a 40minute documentary about the M11 link road campaign.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1970s, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) {{increased}} {{its efforts to}} train storm spotters to spot key features of storms which indicate severe hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and flash flooding. The program was called Skywarn, and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, amateur radio operators, civil defense (now emergency management) spotters, storm chasers, and ordinary citizens. When severe weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for severe weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> the hazard.|$|E
50|$|Bruer also <b>warns</b> <b>of</b> {{the dangers}} of {{enriching}} environments {{on the basis of}} socio-economic value systems, and <b>warns</b> <b>of</b> a tendency to value typically middle class pursuits as more enriching than those associated with a working class lifestyle, when there is no neuroscientific justification for this.|$|R

5|$|Literature {{academic}} Jayne Ashleigh Glover {{says that}} while Zone Three on the surface {{appears to be a}} feminist utopia, Lessing shows that it is far from idyllic. The story narrators, the Chroniclers of Zone Three, question their zone's behaviour and attitudes, and <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> the dangers of stagnation. Al•Ith, upon returning to Zone Three, is shunned by its inhabitants for failing to attend to their zone's needs, and Zone Three's stasis manifests itself in xenophobia when Al•Ith brings back new perspectives, followed by visitors from Zone Four.|$|E
5|$|Many arctiid moths make clicks when hunted by echolocating bats; {{they also}} often contain {{unpalatable}} chemicals. Some such as dogbane tiger moths (Cycnia tenera) have ears and conspicuous coloration, {{and start to}} make clicks when echolocating bats approach. An experiment by Canadian zoologists John M. Ratcliffe and James H. Fullard, using dogbane tiger moths and northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis), suggests the signals in fact both disrupt echolocation and <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> chemical defence. The behaviour of these insects is thus both deimatic and aposematic.|$|E
5|$|Martin Wells, {{a renowned}} Baltimore prosecutor, {{wakes up in}} a prison cell and notices a stitched-up wound on his right cheek. A guard enters and takes him for his transfer. Wells' long-time friend, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and his partner, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), await him and <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> reporters outside. As he exits the building, a man Wells recognizes draws a pistol and shoots him. Wells stares at Scully’s watch as he dies. The hands stop and then begin to turn backwards.|$|E

5|$|Reports from Burundi and Angola <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> {{a threat}} to food {{security}} caused by the African Cassava Mosaic Virus (ACMD). ACMD {{is responsible for the}} loss of a million tons of cassava each year. CMD is prevalent in all the main cassava-growing areas in the Great Lakes region of east Africa, causing between 20 and 90 percent crop losses in the Congo. The FAO emergency relief and rehabilitation program is assisting vulnerable returnee populations in the African Great Lakes Region through mass propagation and distribution of CMD resistant or highly tolerant cassava.|$|E
5|$|Another legend {{tells the}} story of {{conversion}} of Chamunda into a Jain goddess. According to this story, Chamunda sculpted the Mahavira image for the temple in Osian, Jodhpur and was happy with the conversions of the Oswals to Jainism. At the time of Navratri, a festival that celebrates the Divine Mother, Chamunda expected animal sacrifices from the converted Jains. The vegetarian Jains, however, were unable to meet her demand. Ratnaprabhasuri intervened, and as a result, Chamunda accepted vegetarian offerings, forgoing her demand for meat and liquor. Ratnaprabhsuri further named her Sacciya, one who had told the truth, as Chamunda had told him the truth that a rainy season stay in Osian would be beneficial for him. She also became the protective goddess of the temple and remained the clan goddess, Kuladevi, of the Oswals. The Sachiya Mata Temple in Osian was built in her honour. Some Jain scriptures <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> dire consequences of worship of Chamunda by the Hindu rites and rituals.|$|E
5|$|During {{the days}} after the landing, the ground forces secured the Jacquinot Bay area. AIB {{personnel}} manned an outpost to <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> the approach of Japanese forces, while the combat troops patrolled and established positions near the main landing area. On 6 November the company from the 1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion was moved by landing craft to the northern shore of Jacquinot Bay, and subsequently guarded the tracks leading to this area. This unit later relieved the AIB of responsibility for maintaining some of its positions to the east of Jacquinot Bay. During this period the 14th/32nd Battalion remained near the landing area, though one of its companies gradually established an outpost between 8 and 12 November.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fifth}} book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry must confront the newly resurfaced Voldemort. In {{response}} to Voldemort's reappearance, Dumbledore re-activates the Order of the Phoenix, a secret society which works from Sirius Black's dark family home to defeat Voldemort's minions and protect Voldemort's targets, especially Harry. Despite Harry's description of Voldemort's recent activities, the Ministry of Magic {{and many others}} in the magical world refuse to believe that Voldemort has returned. In an attempt to counter and eventually discredit Dumbledore, who along with Harry is the most prominent voice in the Wizarding World attempting to <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> Voldemort's return, the Ministry appoints Dolores Umbridge as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts and the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She transforms the school into a dictatorial regime and refuses to allow the students to learn ways to defend themselves against dark magic.|$|E
5|$|Just to {{the north}} of Culmstock, at Culmstock Beacon, is one of a chain of Elizabethan beacons built to <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> {{possible}} invasion by the Spanish Armada. On 5 November 1380, King Richard II granted Sir William and Lady Margaret Asthorpe a licence to crenellate the Hemyock manor house, meaning the permission to fortify it. Over the centuries, Hemyock Castle had many notable owners including Lord Chief Justice Sir John Popham. During the English Civil War it was held for Parliament, subjected to a brief but brutal siege and eventually slighted to destroy its military value. Parts of the castle walls, towers and moat still remain. They are a scheduled ancient monument and include displays of history and archaeology. The castle was also owned by General Sir John Graves Simcoe the first lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada in 1792. He is buried at Wolford Chapel near Dunkeswell. The chapel is now owned by the Province of Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Rigorous {{attempts}} to <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> tornadoes {{began in the}} United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm. However, {{with the advent of}} weather radar, areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public tornado warnings were issued in 1950 and the first tornado watches and convective outlooks in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that hook echoes are associated with tornadoes. By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms probably producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away.|$|E

5|$|The aye-aye {{is almost}} universally viewed unfavorably across Madagascar, though the tales vary from village to village and region to region. If people see an aye-aye, they may kill it and hang the corpse on a pole near a road {{outside of town}} (so others can carry the bad {{fortunes}} away) or burn their village and move. The superstitions behind aye-aye fady include beliefs that they kill and eat chickens or people, that they kill people in their sleep by cutting their aortic vein, that they embody ancestral spirits, or that they <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> illness, death, or bad luck in the family. As of 1970, {{the people of the}} Marolambo District in the Toamasina Province feared the aye-aye because they believed it had supernatural powers. Because of this, no one was allowed to mock, kill, or eat one.|$|E
5|$|The type {{species of}} the genus Ramaria, R.botrytis was first {{described}} scientifically in 1797 by mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. A widely distributed species, it is found in North America, North Africa, central and eastern Europe, Australia, and Asia. The fungus is mycorrhizal with broadleaf trees, and fruits {{on the ground in}} wooded areas. There are several species of coral fungi that are superficially similar in appearance to R.botrytis, and although comparison of habitat or characteristics like color or branching morphology is often sufficient for identification, sometimes microscopy is required to definitively distinguish between them. Fruit bodies of Ramaria botrytis are edible, and young specimens have a mild, fruity taste. Some authors <b>warn</b> <b>of</b> laxative effects in susceptible individuals. The fungus contains several chemical compounds with in vitro biological activity, and fruit bodies have antimicrobial activity against several species and strains of drug-resistant bacteria that cause disease in humans.|$|E
5|$|While on regular patrol, Symphony Angel {{is forced}} to eject into the Sahara Desert {{following}} an explosion {{to the rear of}} her interceptor's cockpit.
