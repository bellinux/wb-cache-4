500|$|Roosevelt was {{impressed}} by some models Saint-Gaudens had prepared for the cent showing a head of Liberty. [...] In early 1907, he wrote to Saint-Gaudens proposing that a Native American or Indian headdress {{be added to the}} obverse of the cent: [...] "I feel very strongly that on at least one coin <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the Indian feather headdress. [...] It is distinctly American, and very picturesque. [...] Couldn't you have just such a head as you have now, but with the feather headdress?" [...] Numismatic historian Walter Breen described this as [...] "the absurd addition of a feathered warbonnet, such as neither Ms. Liberty nor any Native American woman would ever have worn". [...] Art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that the Indian Head eagle [...] "missed being a great coin because Roosevelt interfered with the choice of headdress (or no headdress) for Liberty".|$|E
500|$|McKinley {{had been}} given nutritive enemas; on September 11, he took some broth by mouth. [...] When it seemed to do him good, the {{following}} morning they allowed him toast, coffee, and chicken broth. [...] His subsequent pain was diagnosed as indigestion; he was given purgatives and most doctors left after their evening consultation. [...] In the early morning of September 13, McKinley suffered a collapse. [...] Urgent word to return to Buffalo was sent to Vice President Roosevelt, [...] from the nearest telegraph or telephone in the Adirondack wilderness; a park ranger was sent to find him. [...] Specialists were summoned; although at first some doctors hoped that McKinley might survive with a weakened heart, by afternoon they knew the case was hopeless. As yet unknown to the doctors, gangrene was growing {{on the walls of}} his stomach and toxins were passing into his blood. [...] McKinley drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} all day; when awake he was the model patient. [...] By evening, McKinley too knew he was dying, [...] "It is useless, gentlemen. I think <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> prayer." [...] His friends and family were admitted, and the First Lady sobbed over him, [...] "I want to go, too. [...] I want to go, too." [...] Her husband replied, [...] "We are all going, we are all going. [...] God's will be done, not ours" [...] and with final strength put an arm around her. [...] He may also have sung part of his favorite hymn, [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee", although other accounts have her singing it softly to him. [...] Ida McKinley was led away, her place briefly taken by Senator Hanna. [...] Morgan recounts their final encounter, [...] "Sometime that terrible evening, Mark Hanna had approached the bedside, tears standing in his eyes, his hands and head shaking in disbelief that thirty years of friendship could end thus." [...] When a tentative, formal greeting gained no coherent response, Hanna [...] "cried out over the years of friendship, 'William, William, don't you know me?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{radio was}} first used {{on the night of}} 24 February 1943, as radio {{reception}} was better in the evening. Some of the news was bewildering to the prisoners: [...] "Who is this General Montgomery? He seems to be the man <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had in charge from the very beginning. A real live wire", wrote Pringle.|$|E

5000|$|Stamper {{is known}} for his role as Chief of the Seattle Police Department (1994-2000) {{responsible}} for Seattle's response to the protests of the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999, which eventually led to his resignation. Stamper has expressed regret about his decisions at the time. When discussing the use of chemical agents such as tear gas Stamper declared it was a mistake and said [...] "The chief in me should have said, 'For the greater good, <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> brought those chemical agents out. <b>We</b> <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> <b>have,</b> I think, raised the stakes.'" ...|$|R

For instance, there are municipal, trading and charitable corporations, and these are all incorporated in different ways according to the law obtaining in different states... I think the States may be trusted to stipulate how they will incorporate companies, although <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some general law in regard to their recognition." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fakrudeen, one of {{the nine}} {{released}} early, was 16 {{at the time of}} the blast. He stated that the group avenged the earlier communal riots with the blasts. He said after the release that [...] "I deeply regret the blasts. I have realised that <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> avenged the riots in court. We should not have retaliated with violence. The law offered many provisions for minorities. We should have used them to get justice".|$|E
2500|$|On December 1, 2011, Hall gave an {{interview}} to National Journal in which he expressed disbelief in anthropogenic climate change. He accused climate scientists of concocting the evidence for anthropogenic climate change {{in order to receive}} federal research grants, citing the Climategate controversy and calling investigations which had largely exonerated them [...] "straw-man reviews". He stated that [...] "I'm really more fearful of freezing. And I don't have any science to prove that. But {{we have a lot of}} science that tells us they're not basing it on real scientific facts." [...] He responded to allegations that Republicans could be called anti-science in light of these views by saying [...] "I'm not anti-science, I'm pro-science. But <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some believable science.... We have to be more careful what outlays we make for something that hasn't been proved." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1950, {{while working}} at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Fermi had a casual {{conversation}} while walking to lunch with colleagues Emil Konopinski, Edward Teller and Herbert York. The men discussed a recent spate of UFO reports and an Alan Dunn cartoon facetiously blaming the disappearance of municipal trashcans on marauding aliens. [...] The conversation shifted to other subjects, until during lunch Fermi suddenly exclaimed, [...] "Where are they?" [...] (alternatively, [...] "Where is everybody?"). [...] Teller remembers, [...] "The result of his question was general laughter because of the strange fact {{that in spite of}} Fermi's question coming from the clear blue, everybody around the table seemed to understand at once that he was talking about extraterrestrial life." [...] Herbert York recalls that Fermi followed up on his comment with a series of calculations on the probability of Earth-like planets, the probability of life, the likely rise and duration of high technology, etc., and concluded that <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been visited long ago and many times over.|$|E
2500|$|Roy Beck, whose 1.5-million-member {{organization}} NumbersUSA {{played a}} major role in defeating the Senate immigration bill, calls Huckabee [...] "an absolute disaster as governor of Arkansas... Every time there was any enforcement in his state, he took the side of the illegal aliens." [...] Huckabee responded by saying if voters are looking for the toughest guy on immigration, he's not their man. [...] Nevertheless, like many in the Republican party, Huckabee's position has evolved, particularly after the bruising immigration reform fight in the summer of 2007. [...] On December 6, 2007, he released a nine-point immigration enforcement and border security plan. [...] These were modeled on a ten-point plan proposed in 2005 by Mark Krikorian. [...] On January 16, 2008, Huckabee became the first presidential candidate to sign Americans for Better Immigration's No-Amnesty pledge. [...] In response, Roy Beck's organization raised his rating on illegal immigration to EXCELLENT. [...] Huckabee continues to speak for the dignity of legal immigrants. [...] In the January 10 Republican debate he said that all immigrants [...] "ought to live with their heads up.. <b>We</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the assumption that everybody here is legal, that nobody here is illegal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eden faulted the United States for {{forcing him}} to withdraw, but he took credit for United Nations action in patrolling the Israeli-Egyptian borders. Eden said of the invasion, [...] "Peace at any price has never averted war. We must not repeat the {{mistakes}} of the pre-war years, by behaving as though the enemies of peace and order are armed with only good intentions." [...] Recalling the incident in a 1967 interview, he declared, [...] "I am still unrepentant about Suez. People never look at {{what would have happened if}} we had done nothing. There is a parallel with the 1930s. If you allow people to break agreements with impunity, the appetite grows to feed on such things. I don't see what other <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> done. One cannot dodge. It is hard to act rather than dodge." [...] In his 1967 interview (which he stipulated would not be used until after his death), Eden acknowledged secret dealings with the French and [...] "intimations" [...] of the Israeli attack. He insisted, however, that [...] "the joint enterprise and the preparations for it were justified in the light of the wrongs it [...] was designed to prevent." [...] "I have no apologies to offer," [...] Eden declared.|$|E
