5000|$|The film {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} a number of critics, {{especially in light of the}} blatant repetition of the formula seen in the earlier John Wayne film. Michael Kerbel from The Village Voice wrote that Shoot Out did have some semblance of True Grit, [...] "'but the humor and charm are missing and what remains - a predictable revenge story - becomes tiresome.'" [...] Others remarked about the slump in Gregory Peck's career: Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film [...] "served 'mostly as a glum reminder of the inadequate use'" [...] of the Hollywood star, while Paine Knickerbocker of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote [...] "'Peck, m'boy, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> doing here?'" ...|$|E

[...] Jacob Bannon Writing for the album began in 1994 and soon after became a collection of four track recordings, however the project remained inactive for a number of years. When Converge had about six months of down time as the band searched for a drummer, Jacob Bannon and Ryan Parker found the time to resurrect the project. They entered GodCity Studios with Kurt Ballou in the winter of 1999, to take on the piles of old four track tapes they had. During the sessions, Ballou contributed a great deal to the album material both as an engineer and musician.|$|E
5000|$|Combs's {{first major}} {{breakthrough}} {{as an actress}} came {{at the age of}} 18, in the CBS television series Picket Fences. She portrayed Kimberly Brock, the daughter of Sheriff Jimmy Brock (played by Tom Skerritt) and his first wife Lydia for the show's four seasons (1992-96). Jimmy's second wife, Dr. Jill Brock (played by Kathy Baker), is her step-mother. Combs auditioned for the role in New York. The casting agent told her that she wasn't right for the part because she [...] "didn't have a big enough heart." [...] Combs retorted, [...] "If you're looking for someone with a big heart, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> doing in New York?". She was later called back and offered the job. Combs won a Young Artist Award for her performance on the show. During 1996, Combs starred as Sophie DiMatteo in Sins of Silence, a drama/horror television film directed by Sam Pillsbury. The following year, Combs portrayed real-life convicted murderer Diane Zamora in the television film Love's Deadly Triangle: The Texas Cadet Murder, and appeared in the fact-based drama film Daughters as Alex Morell, one of the two daughters of a murdered heiress.|$|E
5000|$|... {{day before}} the 1999 Macworld,bought me a {{matching}} pair of {{blue jeans and a}} black turtleneck sweater and matching round eyeglasses. He'd written a sketch for us to perform the next day at Macworld. I'd put my hands together in a kind of Jobs-like silent-prayer pose and then launch into his keynote. And then a few minutes into the address he'd come storming onto the stage and say, 'Wyle, you don't have me at all! <b>What</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> doing? First I pick up my slide-clicker and then I put my hands together.' He'd say,'Ladies and gentlemen, Noah Wyle!; And then he'd kick me off the stage and take over, introducing the latest piece of Apple technology. And that's exactly how we did it. The first few rows, I think, could obviously tell it wasn't him, but most others didn't know at all. And there was this growing ripple of laughter throughout the auditorium when people got what was happening.I honestly had {{had no idea what to}} expect: I thought the whole thing might be an ambush—that he’d get me to his event and that what he said we were going to do in fact wasn’t what we were going to do, and I would somehow be humiliated. But he stayed on script and was very kind to me. —Noah Wyle ...|$|E

[...] Jacob Bannon Supermachiner originally began as a collection of 4 track recordings by Bannon and Parker, recorded in 1994, just prior to Bannon moving to Boston to attend college. The project remained nameless and dormant for a number of years. With the help and inspiration of his good friend Parker, they casually brought the project back to life in the winter of 1998. With his input, they developed collective song ideas into the Rise of the Great Machine album. Bannon structured the lyrical content around his feelings on the rise of technology and the death of the individual, making the project thematic in its content. They entered GodCity Studios with Kurt Ballou in the winter of 1999 to take on the piles of old four track tapes they had. Ballou contributed a great deal to the album material both as an engineer and musician and both Ballou and the band brought something to the table. After the recording was complete, there was little/no time to carry on with the project. The original Rise of the Great Machine CD was released by the Undecided label in 2000 (now out of print). After the album was released future projects were planned but never materialized. However Bannon continued to write music that was sonically different than Converge, which was later released as solo martial many years later.|$|E
5000|$|Dowie {{recommended}} Carlisle to Queens Park Rangers manager Gerry Francis, {{who paid}} a transfer fee of £250,000 to sign him on 25 May 2000. He played his first {{match for the}} team on 12 August 2000 in the 0-0 draw with Birmingham City at Loftus Road. He made a further 31 appearances in the 2000-01 season and scored three times, earning himself a call-up to the England national under-21 team. However, his season was cut short on 31 January 2001, when he suffered his first major injury after a tackle by Rufus Brevett during the 2-0 defeat to Fulham. It was found that Carlisle had torn his posterior cruciate ligament, an injury which kept him sidelined {{for a year and}} caused doctors to believe that his career might be over. While he was out of action, Queens Park Rangers suffered relegation to the Second Division after finishing 23rd in the league. Soon after the injury he attempted suicide, and years later was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Upon his return to football, Carlisle was injured again in a reserve-team match against Bristol City, sparking fears that he had aggravated his previous injury. The damage proved not to be particularly severe, although it delayed his return to training by a further month. [...] "With the knowledge I have now, I realise it had been affecting my performance for a long time, I had been playing at nowhere near 100%. And there was the actual thoughts I was having at the time. At one stage I found I wasn't actually that bothered. Then I suddenly had a moment of clarity and thought: 'Clarke, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> doing?' It was when clarity set in that I felt my lowest. To be honest, I was scared." [...] Clarke Carlisle on his alcohol problem in 2003 After missing the entire 2001-02 campaign, Carlisle returned to competitive football on 7 September 2002 in Queens Park Rangers' 4-0 victory over Mansfield Town. He scored two goals in 41 matches in the 2002-03 season, helping the team to a fourth-placed finish and a spot in the Second Division play-offs. The club reached the 2003 Second Division play-off Final, but were defeated 1-0 by Cardiff City at the Millennium Stadium on 25 May 2003. During the following season, Carlisle developed personal problems, including an alcohol addiction, although he continued to play for a number of months. In September 2003, as the team were travelling to Colchester United for a league fixture, he was found drunk by manager Ian Holloway. He subsequently missed one month of the season after being admitted to Sporting Chance, a clinic run by former England international footballer Tony Adams, for 28 days for treatment for alcohol-related problems. He later had counselling for the problem before returning to action in October 2003. Upon his return to the team, Carlisle won the Second Division Player of the Month award for November 2003. He scored one goal in 39 matches in 2003-04 as Queens Park Rangers finished as runners-up in the league, achieving promotion to the Championship. Carlisle's contract with Queens Park Rangers ended {{at the conclusion of the}} 2003-04 campaign.|$|E
