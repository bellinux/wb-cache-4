5|$|Adriana Caselotti as Snow White: Snow <b>White</b> <b>is</b> a young princess. Her wicked {{stepmother}} {{has forced}} her {{to work as a}} scullery maid in the castle. Despite this, she retains a cheerful but naïve demeanor.|$|E
5|$|If <b>White</b> <b>is</b> {{compelled}} to play Nb1–d2, {{it is sometimes}} a minuscule positional concession, as it {{makes it harder for}} this knight to reach its ideal square d5. However, if Black is later {{compelled to}} exchange Bxd2, that is advantageous to White who thereby gains the bishop pair. Besides, in some situations the Bb4 could be as misplaced as the Nd2. Finally, if White has to play Bd2, then Black should exchange the bishops only if <b>White</b> <b>is</b> forced to recapture with the Nb1, as a recapture by the Qd1 would still allow the Nb1 to reach the d5-square through Nb1–c3–d5.|$|E
50|$|<b>White</b> <b>was</b> born in 1924 in Cardiff, Wales, to {{shipping}} company owner Gwilym Manchip <b>White.</b> When <b>White</b> <b>was</b> young his father contracted tuberculosis, {{and at the}} age of eight <b>White</b> <b>was</b> sent away to boarding school in England to reduce his risk of infection.|$|R

50|$|<b>White</b> <b>was</b> {{overweight}} {{for most}} of his adult life—weighing 375 lb according to Casey Kasem—and suffered from related health problems. In October 1995, <b>White</b> <b>was</b> admitted to a hospital as a result of high blood pressure. In August 1999, <b>White</b> <b>was</b> forced to cancel a month's worth of tour dates owing to exhaustion, high blood pressure, and a hectic schedule. In September 2002, <b>White</b> <b>was</b> hospitalized with kidney failure attributed to chronic diabetes mellitus and high blood pressure.|$|R
5|$|Quants, a {{grassland}} clearing in a forestry plantation {{well known}} for its butterflies including Duke of Burgundy, marsh fritillary and wood <b>white,</b> <b>is</b> a candidate for Special Area of Conservation (cSAC).

5|$|Ryan <b>White</b> <b>is</b> {{buried in}} Cicero, {{close to the}} former home of his mother. In the year {{following}} his death, his grave was vandalized on four occasions. As time passed, Ryan's grave became a shrine for his admirers.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, in the Rubinstein {{variation}} 3...Ng4 4.Bf4 with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ 6.Nc3, after 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 <b>White</b> <b>is</b> {{saddled with}} doubled pawns in c3 and c4 that limit {{the scope of}} his bishop pair. Hence the push c4–c5 {{can be used to}} free the light-squared bishop and disrupt Black's position.|$|E
50|$|<b>White</b> <b>was</b> consecrated on September 8, 1984 {{and served}} as coadjutor bishop in 1984 and 1985; <b>White</b> <b>was</b> diocesan bishop from 1985 to 2003.|$|R

5|$|Francis <b>White</b> <b>was</b> born in 1761 at Hayfield, near Winchester in Frederick County, Colony of Virginia. <b>White</b> <b>was</b> {{the son of}} John White and his wife, Ann Patton White. Through his grandfather, Dr. Robert White (1688–1752), Francis <b>White</b> <b>was</b> of Scottish descent. His uncle <b>was</b> Alexander <b>White</b> (1738–1804), an inaugural {{member of}} the United States House of Representatives.|$|R
5|$|The Adler {{variation}} {{is named after}} the game Adler–Maróczy, played at the 1896 Budapest tournament. <b>White</b> <b>is</b> ready to return the e5-pawn {{in order to develop}} his pieces on their best squares, i.e. the d5-square for the Nb1, the f3-square for the Ng1 and the a1–h8 diagonal for the Bc1.|$|E
5|$|The main {{continuation}} 6.Be3 {{controls the}} a7–g1 diagonal {{and is considered}} to be the best reply. If Black wants to contest the c5-square for his Bf8 he can try 6...Na6, but most games continue with 6...Bb4+. Here the best reply for <b>White</b> <b>is</b> controversial.|$|E
5|$|Zinc <b>white</b> <b>is</b> {{used as a}} pigment in {{paints and}} is more opaque than lithopone, but less opaque than {{titanium}} dioxide. It is also used in coatings for paper. Chinese <b>white</b> <b>is</b> a special grade of zinc white used in artists' pigments. The use of zinc white (zinc oxide) as a pigment in oil painting started {{in the middle of}} 18th century. It has partly replaced the poisonous lead white and was used by painters such as Böcklin, Van Gogh, Manet, Munch and others. It is also a main ingredient of mineral makeup (CI 77947).|$|E
5000|$|Barclay <b>White</b> <b>was</b> born of Quaker {{parentage}} at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Joseph White (December 28, 1785 [...] - [...] May 25, 1827) and Rebecca Smith, his wife. His {{father and}} uncle, Josiah <b>White,</b> <b>were</b> prominent entrepreneurs. He became an orphan {{at the age}} of six. <b>White</b> <b>was</b> educated at Westtown School, Westtown, Pennsylvania, and Smith's Academy, Wilmington, Delaware.|$|R
50|$|<b>White</b> <b>was</b> born in Newport in Clay County {{in north}} Texas. His father, Ed <b>White,</b> <b>was</b> a sharecropper. <b>White</b> {{graduated}} in 1946 from Texas Tech University in Lubbock.|$|R
50|$|White's initial {{involvement}} with The Football Association began in 1976 {{when he was}} elected as a council member representing full member clubs in Cheshire and Merseyside. <b>White</b> <b>was</b> instrumental in helping introduce automatic promotion and relegation with the Football League a decade later. <b>White</b> <b>was</b> elected to the F.A.

5|$|A {{ghost in}} the form of a lady in <b>white</b> <b>is</b> said to haunt the Julian staircase, located in the Victorian part of the house. D'Avigdor-Goldsmid allowed people to drive their {{carriages}} through the grounds of Somerhill, although the house was not open to the public. Sir Julian died in 1896, and Somerhill passed to Sir Osmond d'Avigdor-Goldsmid.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} theoretical {{decision for}} <b>White</b> <b>is</b> to choose whether to play a2–a3. While this move protects the b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:It {{was not so}} long ago that 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, it became apparent in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{players and}} theoreticians have long debated whether, given perfect play by both sides, the game should {{end in a}} win for White, or a draw. Since {{approximately}} 1889, when World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz addressed this issue, the overwhelming consensus has been that a perfectly played game would end in a draw. However, a few notable players have argued that White's advantage may be sufficient to force a win: Weaver Adams and Vsevolod Rauzer claimed that <b>White</b> <b>is</b> winning after the first move 1.e4, while Hans Berliner argued that 1.d4 may win for White.|$|E
5000|$|Morning personality, Jamie <b>White,</b> <b>was</b> {{formerly}} part of {{the morning}} team of [...] "Jamie, Frosty & Frank", until September 15, 1999 when Jamie <b>White</b> <b>was</b> paired with Danny Bonaduce.|$|R

5|$|Lucille La Verne as Evil Queen Grimhilde / Witch: The Queen is the {{stepmother}} of Snow White. Once her magic mirror {{tells her}} that Snow <b>White</b> <b>is</b> fairer than she is, she immediately enlists Humbert the huntsman {{to kill her}} in the woods. After she discovers that Snow White did not die, she disguises herself as an old hag and uses a poisoned apple to remove Snow White from her path without killing her.|$|E
5|$|Not {{until the}} 21st century did players and analysts begin to revive Black's chances in this line. First, Watson {{showed that the}} {{disruptive}} check 9...Qh4+ was playable, the point being that after 10.g3 <b>White</b> <b>is</b> {{no longer able to}} bring the bishop on c1 to the squares g3 or h4, where it can assist in White's kingside attack. Later players such as Gashimov showed that the queen check is not mandatory, and that Black also retains good chances in the line 9...0-0 10.Nf3 Na6 11.0-0 Nb4, taking advantage of the outpost on b4.|$|E
5000|$|<b>White</b> <b>was</b> saved {{first from}} elimination.* When Ryan Seacrest {{announced}} {{the results for}} this particular night, <b>White</b> <b>was</b> among the Bottom 3 but declared safe second, when Kristy Lee Cook was eliminated.|$|R

5|$|Saruman the <b>White</b> <b>is</b> {{a fictional}} {{character}} {{and a major}} antagonist in J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings. He is leader of the Istari, wizards sent to Middle-earth in human form by the godlike Valar to challenge Sauron, the main antagonist of the novel, but eventually he desires Sauron's power for himself and tries to take over Middle-earth by force. His schemes feature prominently in the second volume, The Two Towers, {{and at the end}} of the third volume, The Return of the King. His earlier history is given briefly in the posthumously published The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales.|$|E
5|$|Snow <b>White</b> <b>is</b> {{saved by}} seven dwarfs, each {{named after the}} days of the week and {{possessing}} the power to transform into a rainbow to move {{from one place to another}} (but are only capable if all seven dwarfs are present). The eldest is Sunday, who is a victim of one of Elspeth's spells that has left half of him as a garden gnome. The dwarfs allow Snow White to care for their home, though the dwarf Wednesday is initially suspicious. When Elspeth learns that Snow <b>White</b> <b>is</b> still alive, she prepares a poisoned apple and transforms into Josephine, Snow White's deceased mother, with the magic mirror the Green-Eyed One gave her. Aided by Monday, who is turned into a garden gnome afterward, Elspeth, disguised as Josephine, finds her and convinces her to eat the enchanted and poisoned apple, which seemingly kills Snow White.|$|E
5|$|The ship crosses an ice {{barrier and}} arrives in open sea, {{close to the}} South Pole, albeit with a mild climate. Here the Jane Guy comes upon a mysterious island called Tsalal, {{inhabited}} by a tribe of black, apparently friendly natives led by a chief named Too-Wit. The color <b>white</b> <b>is</b> alien to the island's inhabitants and unnerves them, because nothing that color exists there. Even the natives' teeth are black. The island {{is also home to}} many undiscovered species of flora and fauna. Even its water is different from water elsewhere, being strangely thick and exhibiting multicolored veins.|$|E
50|$|<b>White</b> <b>was</b> born in 1858 to Thomas John White of Bowdon, Cheshire {{and educated}} at New College, Oxford {{from where he}} {{completed}} his graduation in 1881. <b>White</b> <b>was</b> called to the bar in 1883.|$|R
5000|$|<b>White</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} {{at the beginning}} of the Taishō period when natural mutation and separation of some black kōji to <b>white</b> <b>was</b> observed. This effect <b>was</b> researched and <b>white</b> kōji <b>was</b> successfully grown independently. <b>White</b> kōji <b>is</b> easy to cultivate and its enzymes promote rapid saccharization; as a result, it is used to produce most shōchū today. It gives rise to a drink with a refreshing, gentle, sweet taste.|$|R
