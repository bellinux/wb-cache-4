2500|$|... 2016, Lagoon {{continues}} {{more work}} on Cannibal with no new rides again this season, {{as well as}} the opening of Cannibal's Gift Shop which offers an exit to the fenced-off Cannibal Plaza. The gift shop repurposed the old Pit Stop gift shop that was installed for the now removed Top Eliminator Dragsters. A new purchase stand for Double Thunder Raceway is now featured on the side of Cannibal's Gift Shop by the entrance of the ride. Extensive work was also done on Spider with new black and red paint and new <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> bogies for the cars. With the extensive work, the seats now spin freely {{at the top of the}} first drop, instead of the previous forward or backward first drop into a sharp curve which released the spinning seats. New <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> bogies were also installed on Wicked. This year marks the time Lagoon re-introduced the Colossus sign on top of the first loop of Colossus: The Fire Dragon with red coloring for the letters. The sign was removed a few years prior.|$|E
2500|$|On July 8, 1910, a carpenter, Petrus A. Erickson, was {{believed}} to have fallen overboard from the Ocean Wave. [...] Erickson was thought to have fallen into the bay from the paddle <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> {{where he had been}} working when the ferry left San Francisco bound for Point Richmond on the afternoon of the 8th. [...] Erickson's body was initially reported to have been found ten days later, on July 18, 1910, floating beneath Broadway wharf No. 2. [...] This body was to have been turned over to Erickson’s brother. [...] However, the body recovered on July 18 seems not to have been that of Erickson’s. [...] On August 19, 1910, Peter Nelson, the lighthouse keeper at Lime Point Lighthouse, found a body in the surf. [...] Based on the clothing on the body, which had been in the water a month or more, Coroner F.E. Sawyer ruled that the body might be that of Erickson.|$|E
5000|$|The {{undercarriage}} {{was initially}} fixed, {{as required by}} the standard class rules of the time. The wheel was sprung and had its own <b>wheel</b> <b>housing,</b> separate from the internal fuselage space. The wheel brake was coupled to the air brake system.|$|E
50|$|Sun deck {{contained}} the ship's wheelhouse flanked by docking bridges. Outside viewing by <b>wheel</b> <b>house</b> personnel was facilitated by three large forward-looking portholes, flanked by smaller portholes.|$|R

50|$|This {{envelope}} is {{then compared}} with the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> and other components {{in the area to}} perform an interference/collision analysis. The results of this analysis tell the engineers whether that wheel/tire combo will strike the housing and components under normal driving conditions. If so, either a redesign is in order, or that wheel/tire combo will not be recommended.|$|E
50|$|Another popular walk is Dearden Clough to 'Plunge' - {{the ruined}} site of Plunge Mill, {{where there is}} an {{imposing}} pit <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> for a waterwheel. One approach to the clough is from Michael Wife Lane, named after Mary Nuttall, wife of Michael Nuttall, who was fined in 1618 for not maintaining the road and, finally, put in the stocks in 1624 for still not carrying out this work.|$|E

50|$|Fleetwood {{lettering}} {{appeared on}} the rear deck lid trim strip. Single side trim moldings extended from the front <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> {{to the rear of}} the car. Standard equipment included power brakes; power steering; Hydramatic automatic transmission; dual back-up lamps; windshield washers and two-speed wipers; wheel discs; dual outside rearview mirror; vanity mirror; oil filter and power vent windows. Power steering and shock absorbers were improved this year. Engine displacement on the Cadillac OHV V8 was increased to 390 cuin L.|$|E
50|$|Ignoring prototypes, 1,182 Go 145s {{were built}} in Germany for Luftwaffe service. An unknown number of license-produced Go 145s were also built. Further {{development}} of the aircraft was done. The Gotha Go 145B was fitted with an enclosed cockpit and wheel spats (an aerodynamic <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> on fixed-gear). The Go 145C was developed for gunnery training and was fitted with a single 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 15 machine gun in the rear cockpit, requiring removal of that cockpit's flight controls.|$|E
5000|$|... 2014: A. J. Allmendinger won {{his first}} Cup victory, after a lengthy {{marathon}} that included two red flags for track repair caused by serious accidents: the first for a severe accident in which Ryan Newman and Michael McDowell crashed in the exit to turn 5, which saw McDowell's rear <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> break off and puncture {{a hole in the}} Armco barriers, and a second one caused by Denny Hamlin crashing into the gravel barrels at the entrance to pit road.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wheel</b> <b>house</b> was rebuilt in 1954 {{when the}} glen was enjoying {{something}} of a renaissance as a tourist attraction, and rumours abounded {{at this time that}} the <b>wheel</b> <b>house</b> was haunted. The wheel was featured, in a disguised form, in a 1986 episode of the BBC series Lovejoy, in a story that led to buried treasure being discovered in one of the paddles. In 1994 the wheel was refurbished by Laxey Towing Co. Ltd. and re-opened to the fanfare music of Onchan Silver Band. Since this time it has operated sporadically in conjunction with train services on the nearby railway, but, following storms in October 2002, it was damaged and has subsequently been a purely static exhibit.|$|R
50|$|Crosstrees {{were added}} to her {{mainmast}} in 1939.The <b>wheel</b> <b>house</b> was originally open but was enclosed in 1948. A cafeteria was installed in 1955 and the following year she was converted from coal to oil burning and was fitted with radar in 1960.|$|R
50|$|The scenes on Gods yacht {{were shot}} on John Waynes yacht, Wild Goose, the former US Navy {{minesweeper}} USS YMS-328.Wild Goose was used extensively with scenes {{shot from the}} exterior and in the <b>wheel</b> <b>house,</b> cabins, engine room, upper and lower decks.|$|R
5000|$|In 1958 {{there was}} a new grille {{featuring}} multiple round [...] "cleats" [...] at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical members. The grille insert was wider and new bumper guards were positioned lower to the parking lamps. New dual headlamps were used and small chrome fins decorated the front fenders. Tailfins were less pronounced and trim attachments were revised. On the sides of the car were five longer horizontal windsplits ahead of the unskirted rear <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> and front fender horizontal mouldings with crests placed above the trailing edge and no rocker sill trim. The limousine and nine-passenger long wheelbase sedan were available once again.|$|E
5000|$|The 1953 Caribbean {{was perhaps}} Packard’s most easily {{identified}} car {{because of its}} full cutout rear <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> and side trim, limited to a chrome band outline that stretched {{the entire length of}} the car. The band also helped to further delineate the car's wheel openings. A steel continental spare tire was also standard. The hood featured a broad, low leaded-in hood scoop. Bodies for the Caribbean were modified by Mitchell-Bentley Corporation of Ionia, Michigan. Available [...] "advertised" [...] colors for the car were limited to Polaris Blue, Gulf Green Metallic, Maroon Metallic or Sahara Sand. However, a mere handful of special-ordered cars were built in Ivory or Black.|$|E
50|$|The third caution of {{the race}} flew on lap 56 for a crash in the outer loop, a lap later, The race was red flagged to ensue cleanup on the track. Greg Biffle drifted into the runoff area on the exit of turn 5 and came {{across the front of}} Ryan Newman. Newman's car got turned and hit the Armco barrier on the {{right-hand}} side, before turning back towards traffic. It was then T-boned by Michael McDowell. McDowell's rear <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> broke off and punctured a hole in the Armco barrier {{on the left side of}} the track, beyond the exit of The Boot. Bowman also took damage in the wreck, while the red flag was lifted temporarily to bring the field down the front stretch.|$|E
5000|$|The {{remains of}} Boswedden Mine ("Wheal Call" [...] meaning Great Wheel) are {{located at the}} bottom of Kenidjack Valley near the town of St Just in West Penwith, Cornwall. The <b>wheel</b> <b>house</b> {{originally}} had the largest wheel in Cornwall measuring 65 feet in diameter.|$|R

50|$|In 1956 {{there was}} a new grille, with finer {{textured}} insert, and the repositioning of the parking lights in the bumpers, below the wing guards. Buyers were given an option of the standard satin finish grille or an optional gold finish. Cadillac script was found on the left side. A narrow chrome molding and nine vertical louvers were seen. Side trim was about the same as in 1955, except for the addition of exhaust extension moldings on the rear fender. The trim ran long a tapering conical flare from above the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> to the rear bumper. A Fleetwood script appeared on the deck lid and limousine styling was seen again. Both the sedan and the limousine had auxiliary seats and the Imperial limousine again featured a glass driver's partition. Standard equipment was comparable to the previous year. The engine was stroked to 365 cuin L for 285 or 305 hp (213 or 227 kW) in 1956.|$|E

50|$|Foot pedals can be raised, {{relocated}} (for instance swapped {{to be used}} by {{the opposite}} leg) or replaced with hand-controlled devices. The common form of hand controls consists of a push-pull handle mounted below and projecting {{to the side of the}} steering <b>wheel</b> <b>housing.</b> The bar connects by levers to the accelerator and brake pedals, and is typically pivoted so that pushing applies the accelerator while pulling applies the brake. As there is no facility to work a clutch pedal, hand controls must generally be used in cars with automatic transmissions. With one hand continuously engaged working the hand controls, the steering wheel will generally also be fitted with a steering knob to allow one-handed use. More complex fittings may also connect into the electronic circuitry of the vehicle to place indicator and other switches in easy reach of the driver without requiring them to release the hand controls or steering knob. A guard plate may be fitted to prevent inadvertent contact between the driver's feet and the pedals. Extension levers or adapted grips may also be fitted to the parking brake to allow it to be applied by a driver with limited hand or arm strength.|$|E
