5|$|Alan begins {{driving the}} car down the road, and sees Frank Jr. and Betty in front of him. They look behind to wave to Alan, and he waves back. However, the pair keep driving while looking backwards. Observing that a {{railroad}} with an oncoming train is near, Alan desperately tries to signal to them to stop waving and look ahead. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> pay attention to him and continue waving, Alan shields his eyes as the two drive right {{into the path of}} the train and are killed. Back in the present, at the funeral, Hal enters his police car, and decides to go back on the road in order to prevent more traffic accidents from occurring.|$|E
5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all human beings have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, the needs of others, and the feelings that surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E
50|$|Around 10% of U.S. men {{reported}} {{ever having}} an intimate partner {{who tried to}} get pregnant <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to or stopped them from using birth control. Around 9% of U.S. women reported having an intimate partner who tried to get them pregnant <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to or refused to use a condom.|$|R

5|$|There are two {{principal}} damage mechanisms {{to the inner}} ear in industrialised society, and both injure hair cells. The first is exposure to elevated sound levels (noise trauma), {{and the second is}} exposure to drugs and other substances (ototoxicity). A large number of people are exposed to sound levels on a daily basis that are likely to lead to significant hearing loss. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty (11%) and the percentage of those that can be attributed to occupational noise exposure (24%). Furthermore, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately twenty-two million (17%) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise. Workers exposed to hazardous noise further exacerbate the potential for developing noise-induced hearing loss <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> wear hearing protection.|$|E
5|$|Females usually {{engage with}} several males over a {{breeding}} season. The eggs are fertilised internally in the oviduct. The female deposits them individually on leaves of aquatic plants, {{such as water}} cress or floating sweetgrass, usually close to the surface, and, using her hindlegs, folds the leaf around the eggs as protection from predators and radiation. In the absence of suitable plants, the eggs may also be deposited on leaf litter, stones, or even plastic bags. In the northern crested newt, a female takes around five minutes for the deposition of one egg. Crested newt females usually lay around 200 eggs per season, while the marbled newt (T. marmoratus) can lay up to 400. Triturus embryos are usually light-coloured, 1.8–2mm in diameter with a 6mm jelly capsule, which distinguishes them from eggs of other co-existing newt species that are smaller and darker-coloured. A genetic particularity in the genus causes 50% of the embryos to die: their development is arrested <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> possess two different variants of chromosome 1 (i.e., when they are homozygous for that chromosome).|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of other Christian groups recognise Friends among their fellow-Christians. Some people who attend Quaker Meetings assume that Quakers are not Christians, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> hear overtly Christian language {{during the meeting}} for worship.|$|E

25|$|Bilingual {{children}} often interject {{words from the}} other language <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> know or cannot remember the equivalent, and when one language has no suitable equivalent in the other. Taeschner found that bilingual children prefer to insert elements of the other language rather than use simplified forms.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{medical system}} {{is based on}} a {{fee-for-service}} model, in which doctors are paid on the basis of ordering individual tests and procedures, so that most doctors will not get paid <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> recommend (or recommend against) a given treatment. This system creates incentives for doctors to recommend additional treatments, rather than exercising evidence-based restraint.|$|E
25|$|Example: If {{a worker}} {{performs}} well but at certain times, {{he or she}} loves telling jokes, but his or her supervisor dislikes jokes, the supervisor might give the employee a lower rating in all other areas of work. Sometimes it happens <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have a close relationship and manager does not like the employee.|$|E

25|$|Nouns {{indicate}} persons, animals, {{inanimate objects}} or abstract ideas. Mixtec has few nouns for abstract ideas; <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> exist, it uses verbal constructions instead. When a noun {{is followed by}} another in a sentence, the former serves as {{the nucleus of the}} phrase, with the latter acting as a modifier. In many such constructions, the modifier possesses the nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2013 season, the BCS era {{came to a}} {{close and}} was {{replaced}} by the College Football Playoff. Four teams will play in two semifinal games, with the winners advancing to the new College Football Championship Game. Six bowl games — the Rose Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, Cotton Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, and Peach Bowl — will rotate as hosts for the semifinal games, and host major bowls <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> host semifinal games (access bowls).|$|E
25|$|Werner {{syndrome}} (WS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} disorder. It has a global incidence rate of less than 1 in 100,000 live births, although incidences in Japan and Sardinia are higher, where it affects 1 in 20,000-40,000 and 1 in 50,000, respectively. As of 2006, there were approximately 1,300 reported cases of WS worldwide. Affected individuals typically grow and develop normally until puberty, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> experience the typical adolescent growth spurt. The mean age of diagnosis is twenty-four. The median and mean age of death are 47-48 and 54 years, respectively; {{the main cause of}} death is cardiovascular disease or cancer.|$|E

60|$|The {{method and}} {{silence of the}} attacks was {{breaking}} their nerves. Between each new torture came the pitiless, dazing rain of questions, and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> answer to the point, Isabella-colored handkerchiefs were thrust into their mouths.|$|R
25|$|They make blades {{with the}} teeth of piranha, but lately they also use {{metallic}} ones. Until 1990 they practised pottery in small scale, producing a small kind of pot to take with them on their travels and a second, bigger kind, to leave as supplies in their key camping sites. Today they prefer to obtain metallic pots. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have matches or lighters, they use special wood (Pausandra trianae) to produce fire. At present time they do not make mirrors with the resin of Trattinickia glaziovii nor stone axes like they did in past times.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefit of}} a low resting {{metabolism}} is that it requires far less fuel to sustain bodily functions. By using temperature variations in their surroundings, or by remaining cold <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> need to move, reptiles can save considerable amounts of energy compared to endothermic animals of the same size. A crocodile needs from a tenth to {{a fifth of the}} food necessary for a lion of the same weight and can live half a year without eating. Lower food requirements and adaptive metabolisms allow reptiles to dominate the animal life in regions where net calorie availability is too low to sustain large-bodied mammals and birds.|$|E
25|$|The other {{significant}} {{form of communication}} is between the two couples and is different between the genders. Nancy is very curious about and open with the lizards. Though she does become slightly frustrated by their limitations, she tries to help them by explaining aspects of human life they do not understand. Her general kindness toward them and offer of help when the lizards are deciding whether to stay on land or {{to go back to}} the sea influences their decision. Charlie is less forthcoming and more suspicious. He has a hard time accepting the lizards and quickly becomes testy <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> understand his explanations.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Clark assumed an {{expression}} of great solemnity; allusions of this kind to the late Mr. Bowman were only too frequent. He was fortunate <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> grow into reminiscences of a career too blameless for successful imitation.|$|R
25|$|Health-care workers {{treating}} {{people with}} Ebola are at greatest risk of infection. The risk increases <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have appropriate protective clothing such as masks, gowns, gloves and eye protection; do not wear it properly; or handle contaminated clothing incorrectly. This risk is particularly common {{in parts of}} Africa where the disease mostly occurs and health systems function poorly. There has been transmission in hospitals in some African countries that reuse hypodermic needles. Some health-care centers caring for people with the disease do not have running water. In the United States the spread to two medical workers treating infected patients prompted criticism of inadequate training and procedures.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that gifted students are universally gifted {{in all areas of}} academics, and these misconceptions can have a variety of negative emotional effects on a gifted child. Unrealistically high expectations of academic success are often placed on gifted students by both parents and teachers. This pressure can cause gifted students to experience high levels of anxiety, to become perfectionists, and to develop a fear of failure. Gifted students come to define themselves and their identity through their giftedness, which can be problematic as their entire self-concept can be shaken <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> live up to the unrealistically high expectations of others.|$|E
500|$|Burdell is {{a campus}} icon at Georgia Tech, and {{incoming}} freshmen {{are introduced to}} {{him as one of}} the greatest alumni to graduate from the school. George P. Burdell is often paged over the public address system during football games and also at airports, bars, and hotels. Georgia Tech students or alumni often use his name as an alias <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> want to disclose their real name. There is a store in Georgia Tech's student center named [...] "Burdell's".|$|E
