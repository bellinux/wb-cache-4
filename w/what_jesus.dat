5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the Son of God was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> represented. Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation would make sense of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E
5|$|Around AD 30, Jesus and his {{followers}} traveled from Galilee to Jerusalem to observe Passover. Jesus caused a disturbance in the Second Temple, which {{was the center of}} Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished. Jesus had a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. Jesus' words are recorded in the Synoptics and in Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians. The differences in the accounts cannot be completely reconciled, and {{it is impossible to know}} <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> intended, but in general the meal seems to point forward to the coming Kingdom. Jesus probably expected to be killed, and he may have hoped that God would intervene.|$|E

25|$|In 1983 the Shroud {{was given}} to the Holy See by the House of Savoy. However, as with all relics of this kind, the Roman Catholic Church made no pronouncements on its authenticity. As with other {{approved}} Catholic devotions, the matter has been left to the personal decision of the faithful, as long as the Church does not issue a future notification to the contrary. In the Church's view, whether the cloth is authentic or not has no bearing whatsoever on the validity of <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> taught or on the saving power of his death and resurrection.|$|E
25|$|In the 13th lecture, Cyril of Jerusalem {{discusses}} the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are Original sin and Jesus’ sacrificing himself {{to save us}} from our sins. Also, the burial and Resurrection which occurred three days later proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the Father. Cyril was very adamant {{about the fact that}} Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only did he go willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes “who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten”. This line by Cyril shows his belief in the selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final act of Love. The lecture also gives a sort of insight to <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> may have been feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example, Cyril writes “I gave my back to those who beat me and my cheeks to blows; and my face I did not shield from the shame of spitting”. This clearly reflects the teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheeks and not raising your hands against violence because violence just begets violence begets violence. The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the Bible; Cyril is not trying to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.|$|E

500|$|Promotional {{campaigns for}} both the British and American {{broadcasts}} of the series focused on the technology and science {{being used in the}} programme, and the special effects that Red Vision had created. In particular, a facial reconstruction during the final episode showing <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> might have looked like garnered significant media attention. In the lead-up to episode one, several newspapers, including The Daily Mail and The Guardian, ran stories speculating whether the computer-generated image could show the true face of Jesus. British television listings magazine Radio Times featured the reconstructed face on the cover of its 31 March issue under the headline [...] "Is This the Face of Jesus?". This cover and its headline received criticism from some commentators for being sensationalist and misleading.|$|E
500|$|When JC's Girls {{first started}} {{receiving}} funds from Sandals Church in 2005, {{some of the}} church's members were displeased that their tithes and offerings were being given to strip clubs. In 2006, Brown said that funding the activities of JC's Girls was worthwhile because the sex industry [...] "has been largely ignored by the evangelical church" [...] and the budget allotted to JC's Girls is small compared to the money made by the sex industry. Sandals Church members were also concerned that ministering to strippers would be ineffective. Brown responded by referring to Veitch's conversion, suggesting that other strippers could have similar experiences. Terry Barone of the California Southern Baptist Convention asserted that JC's Girls members [...] "are doing <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> did...He ministered to prostitutes and tax collectors." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Final Hours" [...] {{ends with}} a facial {{reconstruction}} suggesting <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> may have looked like. Using one of three first-century Jewish skulls from a forensic science department in Israel, a clay model is created through forensic anthropology by Richard Neave, a retired medical artist from the Unit of Art in Medicine at Manchester University. The face that Neave constructs suggests that Jesus {{would have had a}} broad face and large nose, and differs significantly from his traditional depictions in renaissance art. Additional information about Jesus's skin colour and hair is provided by Goodacre. Using third-century images from the Dura-Europos synagogue—the earliest pictures of Jewish people—Goodacre proposes that Jesus's skin would have been [...] "olive-coloured" [...] and [...] "swarthy", and much darker than his traditional Western image. He also suggests that Jesus would have had short, curly hair and a short cropped beard.|$|E
500|$|Terry Barone, {{spokesman}} of the California Southern Baptist Convention, {{said that}} JC's Girls members [...] "are doing <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> did...He ministered to prostitutes and tax collectors." [...] JC's Girls {{members have been}} criticized for dressing like sex workers, a look that Veitch said is intended to help women in the sex industry identify with the group. A Baptist minister from San Bernardino, California criticized JC's Girls for not explicitly encouraging women in the sex industry to quit, and quoted , a Bible verse that states that a person cannot serve two masters. In response to the idea that strippers should quit their jobs before attending a church, Veitch said, [...] "Do we ask gluttons to stop eating too much before they come to church?" [...] Philip Sherwell of the Calgary Herald called the evangelism of JC's Girls [...] "America's most unusual Christian outreach operation".|$|E
500|$|The work, {{which is}} in five movements, begins with {{a scene from the}} Gospel reading in which Jesus predicts his {{suffering}} in Jerusalem. The unknown poet of the cantata text took the scene {{as a starting point for}} a sequence of aria, recitative, and aria, in which the contemporary Christian takes the place of the disciples, who do not understand <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> is telling them about the events soon to unfold, but follow him nevertheless. The closing chorale is a stanza from Elisabeth Cruciger's hymn [...] "". The music is scored for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir, oboe, strings and continuo. The work shows that Bach had mastered the composition of a dramatic scene, an expressive aria with obbligato oboe, a recitative with strings, an exuberant dance, and a chorale in the style of his predecessor in the position as Thomaskantor, Johann Kuhnau. Bach directed the first performance of the cantata during a church service, together with another audition piece, [...] He performed the cantata again on the last Sunday before Lent a year later, after he had taken up office.|$|E

500|$|The video {{opens with}} a {{motorcycle}} gang cruising down a freeway, wearing studded leather jackets. The motorcycle gang are the Twelve Apostles who followed Jesus, including Judas. Gaga as Mary Magdalene clutches onto a Jesus-like figure (Rick Gonzalez) who wears a golden crown of thorns. Among the riders is Judas (Norman Reedus), who crosses Gaga's bike as she looks meaningfully towards him. The gang passes under a flyover, when the song starts. They reach their rustic hideout called [...] "Electric Chapel" [...] where Gaga dances wearing a red sarong and a bikini top with crosses covering her nipples. Gaga's character watches curiously as the wily Judas enters the biker club and immediately gets involved in a brawl. While trying to protect Jesus from the fights she attempts to warn him about his apostle's impending betrayal, but becomes hypnotized by Judas' allure. The storyline is interspersed with choreographed dance sequences and close-ups of Gaga with stark imagery, including artistic eye make-up, which was compared to the Egyptian Eye of Horus. Her flowing blonde hair is accented by a red bandana, blue leather top and puffy white dress {{in different parts of}} the clip. The blue top worn by Gaga displays the [...] "Sacred Heart", a depiction of <b>what</b> <b>Jesus</b> is said to have revealed as a symbol of his love for humanity.
