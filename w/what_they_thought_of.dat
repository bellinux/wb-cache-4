5|$|According The New York Times, the {{eavesdropping}} operations did {{not only}} target local criminals, {{but also the}} communications of top Chinese leaders, {{including those of the}} General Secretary, President Hu Jintao. One source connected to the Chinese leadership said that Bo tried to monitor nearly all central leaders who had visited Chongqing in order to better understand <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him. In August 2011, a phone call between Hu Jintao and anti-corruption official Ma Wen was found to be wiretapped under Bo's orders. The revelations about the eavesdropping operation resulted in intense scrutiny from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. It was also said to have sowed distrust and {{played a role in the}} falling out of Bo and his police chief Wang Lijun, who allegedly began to use the same eavesdropping methods against Bo himself. The operations were believed to have contributed to Bo's downfall in 2012.|$|E
500|$|The rivalry was {{explored}} in an ITV4 special, Keane & Vieira: Best of Enemies, first broadcast in December 2013.

500|$|Kristina Wilson, {{associate}} professor in the Department of Visual and Performing Arts at Worcester's Clark University, asked people on campus <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Turtle Boy. One person replied [...] "Oh, that's Worcester's monument to bestiality." [...] Wilson said the sculpture is intended to portray [...] "innocence, joy, and rebirth," [...] and that historically Charles Y. Harvey came from an artistic tradition in which [...] "the human figure is the apex of beauty, and how well you can capture that is the demonstration of your artistic talents." [...] Regarding the artistic merit of the work, Wilson said: [...] "It's unfortunate, because it really does look like something untoward is going on." ...|$|E

60|$|There he stopped, feeling {{afraid to}} turn round, {{and his eyes}} fixed {{themselves}} on {{the intricacies of the}} pattern before him. He heard Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other things that he had required for his dreadful work.

60|$|Surely, {{he thought}} to himself, my glad rags in {{themselves}} are eloquent advertisement of my need. Time and again, whenever opportunity offered, he hinted about the purpose of his business. But his admirers' ears were deaf. They sang his praises, told him <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> his story at first sight, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> subsequently <b>thought,</b> <b>what</b> their wives and families thought; but not one hint did they breathe of intention to pay him for it.|$|R
500|$|We {{as readers}} or {{audience}} appreciate the characters {{by the force}} of our imagination's seeming to participate in the scene, as if we were present during such an event in real life. Commenting on the scene in Julius Caesar where Caesar confides to Marc Antony his apprehensions about Cassius, Hazlitt writes: [...] "We know hardly any passage more expressive of the genius of Shakespeare than this. It is {{as if he had been}} actually present, had known the different characters and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> one another, and had taken down what he heard and saw, their looks, words, and gestures, just as they happened." [...] In [...] "Hamlet", he observes that [...] "the characters think and speak and act just as they might do, if left entirely to themselves. [...] The whole play is an exact transcript of what might be supposed to have taken place at the court of Denmark [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Fans of {{the band}} were equally {{polarized}} by A Thousand Suns. Initial signs of the fans' division over the band's new material occurred when [...] "The Catalyst" [...] was released as a single. MTV conducted a poll asking fans how they received the song; most responses were positive but a large amount were dissatisfied with it. Fans then therefore debated on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the new sound. Sara Ferrer of Orange County Reloaded said the album split the views of fans and critics into [...] "love-it versus hate-it groups". Montgomery expressed similar sentiments, saying the album [...] "alternately thrilled and thinned [...] substantial fanbase with its vast swaths of sonic sprawl (and overall lack of guitar solos)." [...] Shinoda shared his thoughts on the divided reception of the fans; he thanked the people who accepted the album and defended it from the criticism of those who disliked it. Commenting on fans' polarized response to the album, Bennington said, [...] " [...] is definitely something that we knew people would need to digest and get {{over the fact that}} it's not what they thought we would do." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{arriving}} at Suez, {{the water that}} the Battalion had been promised {{was nowhere to be}} found. They were assured that the water was coming, but hours later it still had not appeared. Elliott then made one of the [...] "vigorous protests" [...] that he was becoming famous for. He even threatened to march them back across the Suez Canal to get them a drink. [...] "It was outrageous to deprive men of water in the desert" [...] Elliott thundered. He was assured that the water would be available at 05:30 the next morning. Elliott was up at 05:00, and found many of his men had been unable to sleep due to their thirst, and were licking at the taps around camp. He found the camp's Chief Engineer who informed him that the Egyptian civil authorities had not provided enough water for the troops in camp, and that he had strict orders not to start the pumps before 08:00, as it would wake the II Anzac Corps Commander, Lieutenant General Sir Alexander Godley. Elliott remounted his horse and went to II Anzac Corps Headquarters, where he informed a yawning staff officer in silk pyjamas that unless the water was turned on in the next five minutes, the brigade would be assembling and telling the Corps Commander exactly <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him. The staff officer made a phone call, and Elliott was warned that he shouldn't make such a fuss again. He simply replied that he would do whatever was needed to help his men whenever he had to.|$|E

5000|$|... "Forever" [...] was {{the first}} single {{released}} from Kid Rocks 2001 album Cocky. The song was a message to critics who had panned his music. Kid Rock stated that, despite <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought,</b> his formula <b>of</b> hip hop, southern rock and punk rock would last forever. The song name checks Oprah Winfrey, Al Roker, Earl the Pearl and Betsy Ross and also references the song Hit the Road, Jack.|$|R

2500|$|In a Talking to Americans {{segment on}} the Canadian mock {{television}} news show This Hour Has 22 Minutes during the 2000 American election, comedian Rick Mercer posed {{as a reporter}} and asked several people (including then-Texas governor George W.

(The Prime Minister of Canada {{at the time was}} Jean Chrétien.) None of the interviewees noticed the insertion of [...] "Poutine". A few years later when Bush made his first official visit to Canada as President, he joked during a speech, [...] "I told [...] Paul [...] that I really have only one regret about this visit to Canada. There's a prominent citizen who endorsed me in the 2000 election, and I wanted a chance to finally thank him for that endorsement. I was hoping to meet Jean Poutine." [...] The remark was met with laughter and applause.|$|E
2500|$|Werner Erhard and Associates v. Christopher Cox for Congress is {{a lawsuit}} that was filed in 1988 {{by the company}} Werner Erhard and Associates and its owner Werner Erhard (the founder of Erhard Seminars Training, or [...] "est") against then-Congressional {{candidate}} Christopher Cox and his campaign organization Christopher Cox for Congress. [...] Cox's campaign sent out material which was critical of Nathan Rosenberg's ties to Erhard and Erhard's organizations. The mailer described Rosenberg as an [...] "est advocate", and quoted a Los Angeles magazine article which had said the Cult Awareness Network described Erhard's organization as a [...] "destructive cult". Cox's campaign also called citizens and asked them <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> a political candidate who had connections [...] "with that cult est". Cox won the election in the Republican primary, with Irvine, California Councilman David Baker placing second and Rosenberg third. Cox {{went on to win}} the Republican primary and then later won the general election to become the next United States Representative from California's 40th congressional district.|$|E
60|$|On this {{occasion}} {{he was engaged}} in denouncing the vices and pettiness of modern woman--upper-class modern woman--of whom he knew nothing at all, a topic that appealed to an East End congregation. He showed how worthless was this luxurious stamp of females, <b>what</b> a deal <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> dress and of other more evil delights. He compared them to the Florentines whom Savonarola (in his heart Thomas saw resemblances between himself and that great if narrow man) scourged till they wept in repentance and piled up their jewels and fripperies to be burned.|$|R
60|$|Everybody {{said that}} the mill {{residence}} {{had not been so}} thoroughly scoured for twenty years. The miller and David looked on with a sort of awe tempered by gratitude, tacitly admitting by their gaze that this was beyond <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had ever <b>thought</b> <b>of.</b> Mrs. Garland supervised all with disinterested benevolence. It would never have done, she said, for his future daughter-in-law to see the house in its original state. She would have taken a dislike to him, and perhaps to Bob likewise.|$|R
50|$|In May 2010, {{a survey}} of the Okinawan people {{conducted}} by the Mainichi Shimbun and the Ryūkyū Shimpō, found that 71% <b>of</b> Okinawans surveyed <b>thought</b> that the presence of Marines on Okinawa was not necessary (15% said it was necessary.).Asked <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> about 62% <b>of</b> United States Forces Japan bases (exclusive use) being concentrated in Okinawa, 50% said that the number should be reduced, 41% said that the bases should be removed.Asked about the US-Japan security treaty, 55% said it should be changed to a peace treaty, 14% said it should be abolished and 7% said it should be maintained.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are also}} several {{university}} studies, for instance, Eric Lott's critical essay, [...] "All the King's Men: Elvis Impersonators and White Working-Class Masculinity," [...] published in Harry Stecopoulos and Michael Uebel, eds., Race and the Subject of Masculinities (Duke University Press, 1997). The author, professor of American Studies at the University of Virginia, {{has also written}} a long piece on Elvis impersonators and the EPIIA (Elvis Presley Impersonators International Association) {{to be published in}} his next book. For this paper, he interviewed many impersonators and draws parallels with minstrelsy. [...] "It is indeed one place minstrelsy ends up; where 19th-century white guys imitated <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as slave culture and Elvis took from R & B performers, the impersonators copy the copy, if you will—it's minstrelsy once-removed." [...] In her paper, [...] "Women Who 'Do Elvis'", Case Western Reserve University researcher Francesca Brittan deals with female Elvis Presley impersonators and finds them to be [...] "campy, cheeky, and often disturbingly convincing." [...] According to Marjorie Garber's academic study, Vested Interests: Cross-dressing and Cultural Anxiety (1992), Elvis impersonation is so insistently connected with femininity that it is [...] "almost as if the word 'impersonator', in contemporary popular culture, can be modified either by 'female' or by 'Elvis.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Like a good Enlightened scholar, Dr Meek set {{out three}} {{explanations}} for {{the events of the}} Cambuslang Work. He did not mention modern explanations [...] the distress of tailors and shoemakers following the bad harvests of 1741, the tradition of Holy Fairs, the growing interest in Calvinist theology among many people, especially weavers (who read at their looms), including the country wide interest in what was happening in New England. Instead, he argues that this striking event was either natural or supernatural. If it had been natural (and he seems to suspect it was) he thinks it was caused by [...] "sympathy and example" [...] or what would be known today as [...] "mass hysteria". If it had been supernatural, it either came from God or from the devil. The ministers in the Church of Scotland who belonged to the Evangelical Party [...] like those who had preached at Cambuslang [...] were convinced it was a [...] "glorious work of God". However, many of similar Calvinist views had recently left <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as an [...] "ungodly" [...] church and had set up a rival Associate Presbytery. They were convinced that God could not have operated so spectacularly in the Church they had just left, and condemned the Cambuslang Work as [...] "the delusions of Satan, attending the present awful work upon the bodies of men, going on at Cambuslang". A fierce and intemperate pamphlet war ensued [...] though the writers always professed a Christian concern for the truth and the well-being of men's souls. The controversy still rages today, and remarkably similar general positions are still taken, depending on religious convictions, or indeed the lack of them. The Cambuslang Work was a remarkable historical event and one which is peculiarly well, and in great detail, documented.|$|E

25|$|Brownlow's 1980 {{reconstruction}} was re-edited {{and released}} in the United States by American Zoetrope (through Universal Pictures) with a score by Carmine Coppola performed live at the screenings.

At {{the end of the}} 24 January screening, a telephone was brought onstage and the audience was told that Gance was listening on the other end and wished to know <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> his film. The audience erupted in an ovation of applause and cheers that lasted several minutes. The acclaim surrounding the film's revival brought Gance much-belated recognition as a master director before his death only 11 months later, in November 1981.|$|R

[...] "Instead," [...] he says, [...] "they tell us <b>what</b> <b>they</b> saw, and thought," [...] and [...] "what they saw, is, on the whole, more interesting than <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought.</b> The merit <b>of</b> their book lies in the anecdotes, in the descriptions of various people the authors met and got to know." ...|$|R

After responding, the participants were asked <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> the purpose <b>of</b> the study and the masked difference between the two photographs were.

These modifications enabled the TLs to learn to lead workshop 2 – 1 while focusing closely on their own grade-level curricula, so that they felt better prepared to both teach the task to their students and facilitate that workshop with their peers.|$|R

50|$|The land {{on which}} Gederah was {{established}} had once been owned by the Arabs of Qatra, who had lost it due to debts. They were cultivating it as tenant farmers when the Jewish owners arrived and resented the intrusion onto <b>what</b> <b>they</b> still <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as their land. According to another account, the land was actually owned by Qatra, but had been assigned {{by the government to}} the nearby village of Mughar when Qatra disclaimed ownership to avoid a certain murder charge. Mughar then sold it to Polivierre, who sold it to Pines. This, and the close proximity of the two sites, led to poor relations between the communities that sometimes led to violent clashes. Israel Belkind, a member of Bilu, described Gedera's relationship with its Arab neighbors as among the worst in all the settlements. Haim Hissin, also a Bilu member, criticized the Arabs for their provocative behavior, but also blamed the Jews for being unfair and arrogant.|$|R
