500|$|Graham found {{writing for}} two Doctors easy, as Smith's Doctor had a {{constant}} [...] "internal dialogue" [...] {{and was always}} finishing his own sentences. He wanted each character to be different and did not <b>want</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them to become evil, and the Doctor would help them discover their humanity. Graham wanted Jennifer to be the antagonist as he {{liked the idea of}} the quietest character becoming the most evil. The original script explained that she has a perfect memory, and so her Ganger was able to remember every terrible thing that had happened to the Flesh. Several other sequences were cut from the final version of [...] "The Almost People". In the original script, the Doctor quizzes the Flesh Doctor about the events of The Mind of Evil (1971) and mentions former companions Jo Grant, Sarah Jane Smith, Romana, Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, and Donna Noble. There was also a montage of happy memories of the Doctor's life stored in the Flesh Doctor, which included flashbacks of previous episodes and serials of the show as well as events that had not transpired onscreen. Also cut was the TARDIS providing the Doctor with another sonic screwdriver after he had given it to the Flesh Doctor, in a similar fashion to [...] "The Eleventh Hour".|$|E
500|$|On March 8, 2012, Invisible Children {{released}} an official response addressing the criticisms directed at Kony 2012. As {{an explanation for}} the simplicity of the movie, they stated that [...] "in [...] quest to garner wide public support of nuanced policy, [...] sought to explain the conflict in an easily understandable format." [...] Jedidiah Jenkins, the director of idea development for Invisible Children, responded to the new criticisms by saying that they were [...] "myopic" [...] and that the video itself was a [...] "tipping point" [...] that [...] "got young people to care about an issue {{on the other side of}} the planet that doesn’t affect them." [...] In response to concerns about working with the Ugandan government, Invisible Children explained that they [...] "do not defend any of the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Ugandan government or the Ugandan army". They added that the reason why they are working with the Ugandan army even though Kony is no longer in Uganda is that the army is [...] "more organized and better equipped than that of any of the other affected countries (DRC, South Sudan, CAR) to track down Joseph Kony" [...] and that they <b>want</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the governments in the region to work together to arrest Kony. Jenkins stated, [...] "There is a huge problem with political corruption in Africa. If we had the purity to say we will not partner with anyone corrupt, we couldn’t partner with anyone." ...|$|E

[...] I'm just looking around to see who's gonna finish up second." [...] Bird went on to defeat Craig Hodges of the Milwaukee Bucks in the finals to win his first of three {{consecutive}} Three-Point Shootout championships, a record that he currently shares with Hodges.|$|E

I wish Dave and everyone in Megadeth all the best. I am working on a few things of my own and hope that when they come out, you will all dig it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2008, BBC {{reported}} {{before the}} original game was released that Media Molecule {{had already begun}} development of a sequel to LittleBigPlanet. The statement was later clarified {{in an interview with}} IGN, in which Siobhan Reddy of Media Molecule stated, [...] "we see LittleBigPlanet as a platform... There {{will be a lot of}} additional content and it will vary in size and what it does. And we've already started that, yes." [...] The [...] "huge emotional investment" [...] users have made in LittleBigPlanet, Alex Evans stated, is the reason he does not want to ship a traditional sequel. Because they don't <b>want</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the user-generated content to be made obsolete, their focus was to [...] "expand the game without partitioning the audience".|$|E
2500|$|Although it did {{not become}} a {{constitutional}} requirement until 1977, it had been long-standing convention that a Senate casual vacancy be filled by a person from the same political party. However, on 27 February 1975, the Premier of New South Wales, Tom Lewis, controversially appointed Cleaver Bunton, a person with no political affiliations, to replace Murphy in the Senate, beginning the chain of events {{which led to the}} 1975 Australian constitutional crisis. These events in turn laid the groundwork for the 1977 constitutional change that now ensures such an appointment can never be repeated. Soon after his appointment to the bench, Murphy visited Justice Menzies' old chambers in Taylor Square, which would now be his. Staring at the volumes of British law reports on the shelves behind his desk, he said, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these to go". He replaced them with decisions from the Supreme Court of the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{sell their}} extra tickets on StubHub at a profit, often tickets {{which are in}} high demand which are {{difficult}} to find. While concert tickets can get expensive when the demand is high, {{more than half of}} all tickets sold on StubHub go for at or below face value. Tsakalakis has stated that he believes the ticket market is not a level playing field for the average person, in that before a ticket goes on sale, promoters have already sold the vast majority of seats to everyone from fan club members, American Express card holders and ticket brokers. He has said, [...] "There is this whole mentality within concerts that if it doesn't sell out right away it's not a hit. It just doesn't make sense. Nothing works that way. There isn't a supplier out there that says, 'The first day I put my product out there I <b>want</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> it to sell out and I don't want to have any more supply.' What business works that way?" [...] Sellers choose what they want to charge for the ticket. A range of tickets are listed, mainly sporting, concert, theater, and other live entertainment events. Music categories are divided into Classical and Vocal, Country and Folk, Dance and Electronica, Jazz, Blues and RnB, Rock, Pop and Hip-Hop, and World and New Age music. Theatre and comedy is organized by Cirque du Soleil, Classical music and opera, dance/ballet, family, festivals and fairs, film festival, museum, musicals, play, and other/miscellaneous.|$|E
