25|$|Vegetation in {{the basin}} is {{dominated}} by a mixed conifer forest of Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi), lodgepole pine (P. contorta), white fir (Abies concolor), and red fir (A. magnifica). The basin also contains significant areas of wet meadows and riparian areas, dry meadows, brush fields (with Arctostaphylos and Ceanothus) and rock outcrop areas, especially at higher elevations. Ceanothus is capable of fixing nitrogen, but mountain alder (Alnus tenuifolia), which grows along many of the basin’s streams, springs and seeps, fixes far greater quantities, and contributes measurably to nitrate-N concentrations in some small streams. The beaches of Lake Tahoe are the only known habitat for the rare Lake Tahoe yellowcress (Rorippa subumbellata), a plant which grows in the <b>wet</b> <b>sand</b> between low- and high-water marks.|$|E
25|$|Conduit operation, {{in which}} trams took {{electricity}} from a conduit below {{and between the}} tracks, though very successful in locations such as town or city centres, proved to be very problematic on a line {{so close to the}} coast. During bad weather, sea water washed over the track and into the conduit where it short circuited the traction supply and operated the circuit breakers in the power station. Sand from the beaches was blown across the tracks and filled up the conduits. It was constantly necessary to remove this sand, as the addition of sea water would leave the conduits filled with <b>wet</b> <b>sand</b> which short circuited the supply. Another problem was that electrical resistance was greater than anticipated and the voltage in portions of the conduit was far less than that generated at Blundell Street – 230V dropped to 210V at the junction with the main line on the Promenade, 185V at Cocker Street and 168V at South Pier (then Victoria Pier).|$|E
500|$|Excavation of the 3rd Avenue tunnel segment {{began with}} the {{ceremonial}} launch of the [...] "Mighty Mole", a , [...] tunnel boring machine (TBM), on March 6, 1987. The TBM, designed by Robbins Company of Kent, Washington, and built by Nicholson Manufacturing in Seattle, began digging the western tunnel from Union Station the following May. A second, identical [...] "Mighty Mole" [...] TBM began digging the parallel eastern tunnel on June 29. During tunnel boring under 3rd Avenue between Spring Street and Madison Street on October 21, a small earthflow damaged a water main and caused pavement on 3rd Avenue to drop , shutting down water in the nearby Seattle City Light and 1001 Fourth Avenue Plaza buildings. While repairing the broken water main, electricians working on damaged high-voltage cables caused a small power outage that affected eight downtown buildings {{on the night of}} October 28, but were able to restore power by the following morning. Work on the western tunnel was briefly interrupted in November, when the TBM hit an unexpectedly large pocket of loose sand under Madison Street that had to be stabilized with grout to prevent damage to the adjacent Seattle City Light building. Boring on both tunnels was stopped in early January 1988, when a pocket of <b>wet</b> <b>sand</b> was encountered [...] before the planned 90-degree turn onto Pine Street. Metro and tunnel contractors Atkinson/Dillingham, who had scheduled tunnel excavation for completion in mid-January, closed 3rd Avenue between Pike and Pine streets and installed 40 drilled wells to remove water from the sand pocket in February. Digging resumed on the western tunnel on March 14, and the TBM reached Westlake station on April 9, completing the first of the two tunnels. The eastern tunnel was completed a month later on May 18, allowing for parts of the TBMs to be salvaged and the steel outer shells to be buried in the tunnel.|$|E

2500|$|If the {{pores are}} {{saturated}} with water, water must be {{sucked into the}} dilating pore spaces to fill the expanding pores (this phenomenon is visible at the beach when apparently dry spots form around feet that press into the <b>wet</b> <b>sand).</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{surface tension}} of water {{explains}} why the water does not drain out of a <b>wet</b> <b>sand</b> castle or a moist ball of clay. Negative water pressures make the water stick to the particles and pull the particles to each other, friction at the particle contacts make a sand castle stable. But {{as soon as a}} <b>wet</b> <b>sand</b> castle is submerged below a free water surface, the negative pressures are lost and the castle collapses. Considering the effective stress equation, , if the water pressure is negative, the effective stress may be positive, even on a free surface (a surface where the total normal stress is zero). The negative pore pressure pulls the particles together and causes compressive particle to particle contact forces.|$|E
50|$|Water also {{influences}} the effect. <b>Wet</b> <b>sands</b> are usually silent because the grains stick together instead of sliding past each other, but {{small amounts of}} water can actually raise the pitch of the sounds produced.

2500|$|Counter-mining {{activity}} by the Tunnelling Companies RE began at St Eloi {{in the spring}} of 1915. Much of the mining in this sector was done by the 177th Tunnelling Company and the 172nd Tunnelling Company. The Ypres area has a shallow soil layer of loam or sand above waterlogged semi-liquid sand and patches of sand and clay called slurry. Beneath the second layer is a thick seam of blue clay. The early mining took place above the blue clay which put very heavy pressures of water and <b>wet</b> <b>sand</b> on the underground works. In August the digging of galleries had begun to be ready by the end of June 1916.

40|$|Density {{extraction}} from AVO inversion {{is thought}} to be unstable and difficult. Recent research has, however, shown {{that it is possible to}} extract density reliably from P-wave reflection data if the density contrast is significant across the interface. This approach is tested over a gas reservoir where petrophysical evidence suggests that density is the primary driver of reflectivity. By adopting a linear as well as a non-linear approach, inversion is performed for density and P-wave velocity from a 3 D prestack seismic dataset acquired over this gas reservoir. The non-linear inversion results agree well with the log and production data, thus proving that density can be extracted reliably in this case and used for reservoir characterization. We use the extracted density along with the P-wave velocity to distinguish the low-density porous gas <b>sands</b> from <b>wet</b> <b>sands,</b> tight sands, and shales...|$|R
