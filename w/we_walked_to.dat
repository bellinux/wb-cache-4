Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E

Then in early 1967 <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> our new promised land, we call it Daguragu (Wattie Creek), back to our sacred places and our country, our new homeland." ...|$|E
2500|$|While not {{active in}} any Watergate {{activities}} per se, Gray was aware through {{his dealings with}} John Dean that the White House was concerned about what might be discovered from a full-field FBI investigation and explored {{what he could do}} to limit the investigation or shift it away from the Bureau’s jurisdiction. As Dean wrote in his Watergate memoir “Blind Ambition,” he used Gray as a shill knowing that “we could count on Pat Gray to keep the Hunt material from becoming public, and he did not disappoint us.” [...] In fact, even though he thought of this as a political not criminal situation and that he was ultimately serving the President as the “nation’s chief law enforcement officer,” Gray would come dangerously close to collusion because he chose to be useful to the White House without asking the hard questions. Dean goes on to say, “I met Pat Gray secretly at his home in southwest Washington. We were both apprehensive about the meeting as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> a park and sat down on a bench overlooking the Potomac, discussing my request to obtain FBI 302s and AirTels on the Watergate investigation." ...|$|E

6000|$|Thus <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the door, in {{friendly}} colloquy. Somehow if {{he failed}} to speak of shirtings and hosiery, I should feel as if a familiar cord had broken; ...|$|R
5000|$|The Way <b>We</b> <b>Walk</b> refers <b>to</b> four {{works by}} the rock band Genesis: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of}} the platform, side by side, in silence.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> one side. Mr. Stillwell was {{itching to}} hear what was said, but I gave him no {{opportunity}} of doing so.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> {{the break}} of the poop, where {{she turned and}} faced me. I glanced around to see {{that no one was}} within hearing distance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] she said, [...] "let us {{have our}} coffee later. We have {{finished}} dinner {{and the moon}} is coming up. If <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the bottom there, we shall see it from the bend of the river, and we shall escape from those men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the ridge?" [...] Herminia {{asked with}} a sudden burst of suggestion. [...] "It's too rare a day to waste a minute of it indoors. I was waiting till you came. We can talk all the freer for the fresh air on the hill-top." ...|$|R
60|$|This I {{did very}} reverently and <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> back <b>to</b> the temple almost in silence.|$|R
60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> where Marais's wagon {{stood at}} the end of the line, and found him sitting on the disselboom cutting up tobacco with his pocket-knife.|$|E
60|$|So our bonds were undone and <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> {{where the}} king and Brother John stood, the miserable Imbozwi and his {{attendant}} doctors huddled in a heap before them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know. Because {{you were}} cross, and surly, and {{thinking}} of nothing but your tobacco, I believe. Do you remember how <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> Niddon, and you hadn't a word for anybody?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There came a still longer interval, which Mrs. Pope {{ended with}} the {{slightest}} of shivers. She perceived Mr. Magnet was heavy for sympathy and ripe to confide. [...] "I think," [...] she said, [...] "it's a little cool here. Shall <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> the Water Garden, {{and see if there}} are any white lilies?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> up <b>to</b> {{the great}} door of Styles, {{and at once}} the {{knowledge}} came to us that something was wrong.|$|R
60|$|Herbert got up, {{and linked}} {{his arm in}} mine, and <b>we</b> slowly <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> and fro together, {{studying}} the carpet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hugh," [...] said Leonard Dickinson {{to me as}} <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> {{the bank}} together, [...] "Scherer will never be any good any more. Too much prosperity. And he's begun to have his nails manicured." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> {{the far end}} of the hall. Major Fitz-David {{opened the}} door of a long, narrow room built out at the back of the house as a smoking-room, and {{extending}} along one side of the courtyard as far as the stable wall.|$|E
60|$|Mitchell did {{not appear}} amused. I watched his face anxiously. He had made no remark, but the missed putt which would have saved the hole had been very short, and I feared the worst. There was a {{brooding}} {{look in his eye}} as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the fourteenth tee.|$|E
60|$|He {{took the}} {{path through the}} plantation, and <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> down <b>to</b> the village through the woods which bordered {{one side of the}} estate.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> down <b>to</b> {{the drug}} store. On entering, Mr. Harrison ordered {{a couple of}} glasses of soda water and then called the {{proprietor}} aside.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] {{said the}} latter, with {{something}} of his usual briskness; [...] "if {{you are still}} in the humor, suppose <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> over <b>to</b> Lethbury." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, then," [...] said he, {{when we had}} had {{a little}} {{conversation}} about terms, [...] "the {{first thing to do}} is to find out where there is water. Have you a peach-tree on the place?" [...] <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> such a tree, and he cut therefrom a forked twig.|$|E
60|$|I {{pressed her}} arm to mine, but I said nothing. When I could avoid it, I {{preferred}} not to discuss those other matters. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the ship's side, and leaned over to watch the phosphorus. Suddenly she whispered in my ear, her lips were so close to my cheek that I felt her warm breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} that view several times," [...] she answered; and then, after a little pause, she added, [...] "But I don't mind in the least seeing it again." [...] Together <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the bluff. There we found two rude seats which had been made for the {{convenience}} of viewers, and on one of these she seated herself.|$|E
60|$|Adrian smiled gently; {{and after}} giving his {{orders to the}} gamekeepers, {{he came up to}} me; putting his arm in mine, <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{together}} <b>to</b> the mansion.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{he may be}} able to give us some information," [...] Louise asserted; [...] "so I propose <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> over <b>to</b> {{the town}} {{tomorrow}} morning and interview him." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> round <b>to</b> Harris's, {{and put the}} {{proposal}} before him. He examined the book, especially the chapters dealing with the purchase of shoes and hats. He said: ...|$|R
60|$|She rose to {{her feet}} at once, and moved towards the door. I was left alone with my father, but he never stirred during her absence, nor did I speak to him. She {{returned}} in a few minutes, dressed very quietly, and wearing a veil which completely obscured her features. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the corner of the square, and then I called a hansom.|$|E
60|$|I {{wondered}} as I preceded him downstairs {{what had}} happened to the little lady in the tea-shop. Had they quarrelled already, or was his infatuation passed? It seemed hardly likely if, as appeared, he had been taking steps for a year to make his desperate plunge. <b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> the Avenue de Clichy, and sat down at one of the tables on the pavement of a large cafe.|$|E
60|$|At the {{appointed}} {{time in the}} evening, Mr. Micawber reappeared. I washed my hands and face, to do the greater honour to his gentility, and <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> our house, as I suppose I must now call it, together; Mr. Micawber impressing the name of streets, and the shapes of corner houses upon me, as we went along, that I might find my way back, easily, in the morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} {{not to be}} able to accept your invitation," [...] I said, as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> {{together}} <b>to</b> the door. [...] "Perhaps you will give me another chance?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> {{together}} <b>to</b> {{the house}} of that lady, and at my suggestion Philippa sought her couch. I sat down and awaited the advent of Mrs. Thompson. She soon appeared.|$|R
60|$|THE MOTHER. It's quite fine now, Clara. <b>We</b> can <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> a motor bus. Come. [She gathers {{her skirts}} above her ankles and hurries off towards the Strand].|$|R
