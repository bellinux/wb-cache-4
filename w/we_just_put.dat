500|$|... "Way Too Cold" [...] was {{produced}} by Hit-Boy, a producer signed to West's label GOOD Music, known for his production on [...] "Niggas in Paris". [...] According to Hit-boy, he had [...] "made the beat a couple months ago, just in a session messing around" [...] and that Kanye [...] "just did the record maybe {{a week and a}} half ago. We actually don’t know if it's going to be on Khaled's album or ‘Ye's album. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> it out because we felt like it was so urgent, people just needed to hear it."

500|$|Black Sabbath's {{first major}} {{exposure}} {{came when the}} band appeared on John Peel's Top Gear radio show in 1969, performing [...] "Black Sabbath", [...] "N.I.B.", [...] "Behind the Wall of Sleep", and [...] "Sleeping Village" [...] to a national audience in Great Britain shortly before recording of their first album commenced. Although the [...] "Evil Woman" [...] single failed to chart, the band were afforded two days of studio time in November to record their debut album with producer Rodger Bain. Iommi recalls recording live: [...] "We thought 'We have two days {{to do it and}} one of the days is mixing.' So we played live. Ozzy was singing at the same time, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> him in a separate booth and off we went. We never had a second run of most of the stuff." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1995, [...] "Creep" [...] was {{nominated}} for three categories at the first Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards, including Best R/Soul Single by a Group, Band or Duo, R/Soul Song of the Year and R/Soul Music Video of the Year, in which they won the first title. Later, the song went on to receive two Grammy nominations at the 38th ceremony for Best R Song—for Austin's composition—and for Best R Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, eventually winning the latter. [...] "We were in shock! <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> out music so that people could find a connection with what were saying, so we didn't know exactly how people would feel about anything," [...] Thomas says as she recalls TLC's winning moment. [...] "So when you {{get that kind of}} recognition, it says so much. The Grammys is like the Oscars of music, so we were just beyond happy to get one." [...] Shortly after winning, they announced their bankruptcy in an interview backstage of the show. The song's publisher, EMI, later received the 1996 ASCAP Pop Music Award for Publisher of the Year.|$|E
2500|$|For The Veronicas, Jessica and Lisa {{wanted to}} create a [...] "progressive pop" [...] album drawing on {{inspiration}} from genres such as blues, trip hop, rock and roll, grunge, classical music, classical rock, pop and rap. Wanting to make an album which differed from their more familiar pop rock sound, Lisa said that this album would be [...] "eclectic" [...] and not [...] "predictable in any way." [...] Lisa said [...] "We go from something like “Sanctified,” which, to be honest, wasn’t written with the idea of being a Veronicas track. That was very much written when I was in Nashville and I was immersing myself in the blues and roots-y, swampy soul singing. Then we were working with Billy Corgan we did a “fuck you” kind of track “Did You Miss Me,” which we rap on, which is a completely different thing. We get poppy with “Cold,” and bring it back to an acoustic song like “You and Me” which could be considered a little bit folk-y, country" [...] " [...] Lisa said [...] "I remember we really got into trip hop and decided we were going to make a trip hop album. I then got on a bluesy-rock-swampy-soul kick after we'd spent some time in Nashville. Eventually we came back around to songs like Cruel – the stuff people identify with The Veronicas." [...] In an interview with Stephanie Anderson of BuzzFeed, the duo elaborated on the change from their first two albums, with Jessica saying: [...] "If things were one dimensional on the first and second record, like, we would say exactly how we felt, and it was all just, total passion, we really didn’t overthink it, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> down what we were feeling, [...] is more, 3D-4D...

That's good enough, I believe. But what I want to point out to you is this. The old game was a risky game. The new game's as safe as running a Vienna bakery. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> this Farallone before the wind, and run till we're well to looard of our port of departure, and reasonably well up with some other place where they have an American consul.

6000|$|Lemarchant curled his lip contemptuously (he didn't {{think much}} of Paterson, because his father {{was said to be}} a Glasgow grocer), and {{answered}} in his rapid, dare-devil fashion: [...] "No fun! Isn't there, just! that's all you know about it, my good fellow. Now I'll give you one example. One day, the inspector came in and told us {{there were a lot of}} blacks camping out on our estate down by the Warramidgee river. So we jumped on our horses like a shot, went down there immediately, and began dispersing them. We didn't fire at them, because the grass and ferns and things were very high, and we might have wasted our ammunition; but we went at them with native spears, just for all the world like pig-sticking. You should have seen those black fellows run for their lives through the long grass--men, women, and little ones together. We rode after them, full pelt; and as we came up with them, one by one, we just rolled them over, helter-skelter, as if they'd been antelopes or bears or something. By-and-by, after a good long charge or two, we'd cleared the place of the big blacks altogether; but the gins and the children, some of them, lay lurking in among the grass, you know, and wouldn't come out and give us fair sport, as they ought to have done, out in the open: children will pack, you see, whenever they're hard driven, exactly like grouse, after a month or two's steady shooting. Well, to make them start and show game, of course <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>put</b> a match to the grass; and in a minute the whole thing was in a blaze, right down the corner to the two rivers. So we turned our horses into the stream, and rode alongside, half a dozen of us on each river; and every now and then, one of the young ones would break cover, and slide out quietly into the stream, and try to swim across without being perceived, and get clean away into the back country. Then we just made a dash at them with the pig-spears; and sometimes they'd dive--and precious good divers they are, too, those Queenslanders, I can tell you; but we waited around till they came up again, and then we stuck them as sure as houses. That's what we call dispersing the natives over in Queensland: extending the blessings of civilization to the unsettled parts of the back country." ...|$|E
