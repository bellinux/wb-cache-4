5|$|The British naturalist Gilbert White {{was one of}} {{the first}} people to {{separate}} the similar-looking common chiffchaff, willow warbler and <b>wood</b> <b>warbler</b> by their songs, as detailed in 1789 in The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne, but the common chiffchaff was first formally described as Sylvia collybita by French ornithologist Louis Vieillot in 1817 in his Nouveau Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle.|$|E
5|$|The common {{chiffchaff}} breeds across Europe and Asia east {{to eastern}} Siberia and north to about 70°N, with isolated populations in northwest Africa, northern and western Turkey and northwestern Iran. It is migratory, {{but it is}} one of the first passerine birds to return to its breeding areas in the spring and among the last to leave in late autumn. When breeding, it is a bird of open woodlands with some taller trees and ground cover for nesting purposes. These trees are typically at least 5metres (16ft) high, with undergrowth that is an open, poor to medium mix of grasses, bracken, nettles or similar plants. Its breeding habitat is quite specific, and even near relatives do not share it; for example, the willow warbler (P. trochilus) prefers younger trees, while the <b>wood</b> <b>warbler</b> (P. sibilatrix) prefers less undergrowth. In winter, the common chiffchaff uses a wider range of habitats including scrub, and is not so dependent on trees. It is often found near water, unlike the willow warbler which tolerates drier habitats. There is an increasing tendency to winter in western Europe well north of the traditional areas, especially in coastal southern England and the mild urban microclimate of London. These overwintering common chiffchaffs include some visitors of the eastern subspecies abietinus and tristis, so they are certainly not all birds which have bred locally, although some undoubtedly are.|$|E
25|$|Chaffinches and robins are {{the most}} common species in the woodlands. Other species that breed there include blackcaps and garden warblers. The rare {{redstart}} and <b>wood</b> <b>warbler</b> are thought to have a few breeding pairs in the park's woodlands.|$|E

50|$|The elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler</b> {{was placed}} on the United States federal {{candidate}} list for the Endangered Species Act in 1999, and the announcement was published on the Federal Register of October 25, 1999, Volume 64, No. 205, pages 57535-57547. The USFWS started to consider the need to protect the elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler</b> in 1982. In 2005, a group of scientists, scholars, artists and environmentalists petitioned the Bush administration to admit 225 species, including the elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler,</b> to the Endangered Species Act. Of these 225 species, more than one third have been on the candidate list for 20 or more years, and half for 10 or more years. Recent (2004) studies also show that since the creation of the Endangered Species Act in 1973, 114 United States species have become extinct, many because of lack of habitat protection by the federal government.|$|R
2500|$|The Park {{boasts a}} wealth of bird life, and is of ornithological {{importance}} because it supports a diverse range of birds. 141 bird species have been recorded in the park, including upland, woodland and wintering waterfowl species. Several species which are otherwise rare in Ireland are present, notably the woodland species redstart (1–2 pairs), <b>wood</b> <b>warbler</b> (1–2 pairs), and garden warbler (possibly up to 10 pairs). The red grouse and ring ouzel are on the IUCN Red List of species of high conservation concern (1–2 pairs each). The Greenland white-fronted goose, merlin, and peregrine are listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive. Other noteworthy species found in the park are the chough, nightjar, and osprey. The osprey sometimes passes through the park as it migrates between northern Africa and Scandinavia. Historical accounts and place names suggest that the osprey bred {{in the area in}} the past. Golden eagles once nested in the park, but were extirpated around 1900 as a result of disturbance, nest robbing, and persecution.|$|E
60|$|We {{have here}} every {{gradation}} of difference from perfect identity with the continental species to genera so distinct {{that it is}} difficult to determine with what forms they are most nearly allied; and it is interesting to note that this diversity bears a distinct relation to the probabilities of, and facilities for, migration to the islands. The excessively abundant rice-bird, which breeds in Canada and swarms over the whole United States, migrating to the West Indies and South America, visiting the distant Bermudas almost every year, and extending its range as far as Paraguay, is the only species of land-bird which remains completely unchanged in the Galapagos; and we may therefore conclude that some stragglers of the migrating host reach the islands sufficiently often to keep up the purity of the breed. Next, we have the almost cosmopolite short-eared owl (Asio brachyotus), which ranges from China to Ireland, and from Greenland to the Straits of Magellan, and of this the Galapagos bird is probably only one of the numerous varieties. The little <b>wood</b> <b>warbler</b> (Dendroeca aureola) is closely allied to a species which {283} ranges over the whole of North America and as far south as New Grenada. It has also been occasionally met with in Bermuda, an indication that it has considerable powers of flight and endurance. The more distinct species--as the tyrant fly-catchers (Pyrocephalus and Myiarchus), the ground-dove (Zenaida), and the buzzard (Buteo), are all allied to non-migratory species peculiar to tropical America, and of a more restricted range; while the distinct genera are allied to South American groups of thrushes, finches, and sugar-birds which have usually restricted ranges, and whose habits are such as not to render them likely to be carried out to sea. The remote ancestral forms of these birds which, owing to some exceptional causes, reached the Galapagos, have thus remained uninfluenced by later migrations, and have, in consequence, been developed into a variety of distinct types adapted to the peculiar conditions of existence under which they have been placed. Sometimes the different species thus formed are confined to one or two of the islands only, as the three species of Certhidea, which are divided between the islands but do not appear ever to occur together. Nesomimus parvulus is confined to Albemarle Island, and N. trifasciatus to Charles Island; Cactornis pallida to Indefatigable Island, C. brevirostris to Chatham Island, and C. abingdoni to Abingdon Island.|$|E
50|$|The {{magnolia}} warbler (Setophaga magnolia) is {{a member}} of the <b>wood</b> <b>warbler</b> family Parulidae.|$|E
50|$|In September 1989, Hurricane Hugo {{struck the}} central and eastern region of Puerto Rico, {{affecting}} three (the El Yunque National Forest, Toro Negro and Carite populations) of the four known populations of the elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler.</b> A survey conducted two years later in the Toro Negro Forest, located in the Cordillera Central, {{did not find any}} individuals. Recent surveys suggest that, for reasons yet unknown, the populations at Carite and Toro Negro were likely extirpated. Continued monitoring of the elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler</b> populations is achieved through bird counts performed every three to four years by the Puerto Rican Breeding Bird Survey (PRBBS). A survey conducted in 2001 found three individuals at the Maricao State Forest. An IUCN assessment of the elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler,</b> prepared in 2000, estimated a stable population of 600 mature individuals. More recently the population has been estimated to comprise at least 1800 mature individuals, a figure which equates to at least 2700 individual birds.|$|R
50|$|The elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler</b> {{is often}} {{confused}} with the black-and-white warbler (Mniotilta varia), a non-breeding species in the Caribbean occurring in Puerto Rico from mid-September to early May. The main physical distinction is in the eyes. The elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler</b> has an incomplete white eyering, while the black-and-white warbler has a white band across the eye and a white {{lower half of the}} eyering. Another distinction is found in the crown, with the elfin woods warbler's being entirely black and the black-and-white's having a white band across. The latter species forages on larger branches compared with the elfin woods warbler's foraging in the canopy and on smaller branch tips.|$|R
50|$|The elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler</b> (Setophaga angelae) is a bird, {{endemic to}} Puerto Rico, {{where it is}} a local and {{uncommon}} species. Discovered in 1968 and described in 1972, {{it is the most}} recently described species of New World warbler (family Parulidae).|$|R
50|$|Nesting birds include redstart, {{great tit}} and blue tit. The <b>wood</b> <b>warbler</b> and turtle dove are {{recorded}} visitors.|$|E

50|$|The {{area has}} a rich bird community, {{including}} all three native woodpecker species and the tawny owl. Other species include redstart, <b>wood</b> <b>warbler,</b> pied flycatcher and treecreeper.|$|E
50|$|The elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler</b> is {{commonly}} found foraging the middle canopy for insects. While searching for food it often flocks with other birds, such as black-and-white warblers, Puerto Rican tanagers and Lesser Antillean pewees. Three maneuvers used for catching prey—gleaning, sally-hovering and probing—have been described. Gleaning {{is described as}} a hunting maneuver made by a standing or moving bird. Sally-hovering is a hunting maneuver made by a bird in flight. Probing is a maneuver in which the bird, by digging with its beak, forages the substrate looking for food {{in a manner similar to}} chickens. Gleaning, especially off leaves, is the maneuver used with more frequency by the elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler</b> while probing is the least used.|$|R
50|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} using mitochondrial DNA sequences from New World warblers has shown that, within the genus Setophaga, the elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler</b> is most {{closely related to}} the arrowhead warbler, a species which is endemic to Jamaica, and the plumbeous warbler, which is endemic to the islands of Dominica and Saint Lucia.|$|R
5000|$|El Yunque {{is one of}} the two {{locations}} with populations of the elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler,</b> the other being Maricao State Forest. The species was first discovered in El Yunque. This species of bird is endemic to Puerto Rico and first described in 1972; it inhabits the dwarf (or [...] "elfin") forest at high elevations in El Yunque.|$|R
50|$|Woodlands support birdlife and {{breeding}} birds recorded are <b>wood</b> <b>warbler,</b> pied flycatcher, hawfinch, {{great spotted woodpecker}} and lesser spotted woodpecker. Hunting birds recorded are buzzard and sparrowhawk.|$|E
50|$|The site {{contains}} an outstanding assemblage of woodland breeding birds including particularly high densities of <b>wood</b> <b>warbler</b> (Phylloscopus sibilatrix), redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) and pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). These are all summer visitors.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} {{abundant}} wildlife. Most woodland species {{can be seen}} easily - including lesser spotted woodpecker and redstart. It is known for being the last remaining locality of <b>wood</b> <b>warbler</b> in Surrey.|$|E
5000|$|The IUCN first {{evaluated}} {{the status of}} the elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler</b> in 1988. At the time, it was given a classification of lower risk/least concern. In 1994 its status was changed to lower risk/near threatened, and in 2000 its status was changed to vulnerable, where it remains. The justification for maintaining the species' status as vulnerable is that [...] "There are no direct or immediate threats, but the combination of a very small range and population may have important implications for its chances of long-term survival, and this species consequently qualifies as vulnerable".|$|R
50|$|When first discovered, the elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler</b> was {{believed}} to exclusively occur in the high elevation, from 640 to 1030 m, dwarf or elfin forests of the El Yunque National Forest in eastern Puerto Rico. The wind-clipped trees in these forests rarely exceed 5 m in height and are characterized by stiff, thick twigs, leathery leaves and impenetrable, dense undergrowth ideal for hiding from predators. Later studies showed that the species migrated to lower elevations, between 370 and 600 m, in Tabonuco and Palo Colorado forests. Three more populations were discovered in the Maricao State Forest (1972, largest known population), the Carite State Forest (1977) and the Toro Negro State Forest (late 1970s).|$|R
50|$|The warbler's {{upper body}} is {{predominantly}} black with white areas, while its underparts are white with black streaks. Other identifying characteristics are dark brown eyes, white patches on its ears and neck, an incomplete white eyering, a white eyestripe, and two white spots on its outer tail feathers. Characteristic of Antillean warblers (S. adelaidae, S. delicata, S. plumbea, and S. pharetra), the species features a long bill and short, round wings (53.8 mm average). Among Setophaga spp., only S. adelaidae has a shorter wing length average (50 mm) than the elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler.</b> Juveniles differ from adults, retaining a grayish-green back for approximately {{a year and}} partially molting from July to October. The warbler's average mature length is 12.5 cm and its average weight is 8.4 g.|$|R
50|$|Birds include blackbird, blackcap, chaffinch, jay, robin, sparrowhawk, blue tit, great tit, {{grey wagtail}} and wren. Some years, the rare <b>wood</b> <b>warbler</b> visits. Red {{squirrels}} are common as are sika deer, fox and badger.|$|E
50|$|The {{woodlands}} {{contain some}} deciduous trees but {{are dominated by}} recent conifer plantations. They contain a range of flora and fauna including various ferns and mosses and woodland birds such as <b>wood</b> <b>warbler</b> and redstart.|$|E
5000|$|Lancaut's cliffs, {{which are}} south-facing, are regular nesting sites for {{peregrine}} falcons and ravens. Sparrowhawk, goshawk, kestrel, cormorant, heron, shelduck, <b>wood</b> <b>warbler,</b> lapwing and goldcrest are amongst {{the wide range}} of birds recorded. [...] ` ...|$|E
50|$|The elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler</b> breeds from March to June. Both {{parents are}} {{involved}} {{in the construction of the}} nest and in feeding the chicks. Nests are built close to the tree trunk within dry aerial leaf litter, usually Cecropia leaves (a material used by no other Parulidae species), in Bulbophyllum wadsworthii trees. Nests are well-concealed and located 1.3 to 7.6 m above ground level. Nests are cup-shaped and made from small roots and twigs, dry leaves of Chusquea abietifolia and B. wadsworthii, and dry Panicum maximum leaves. The interior is made from fibers of C. abietifolia, dry leaves and other plant matter. Females lay two or three white eggs with red-brown spots. The chick's diet consists of insects—parents have been observed offering lepidopteran and orthopteran adults and lepidopteran larvae to hatchlings.|$|R
50|$|The {{survival}} of the elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler</b> faces two main threats, predation and the destruction or alteration of suitable habitat. Confirmed native predators are the pearly-eyed thrasher (Margarops fuscatus), the Puerto Rican sharp-shinned hawk (Accipiter striatus venator) and the extirpated white-necked crow (Corvus leucognaphalus), while unconfirmed native predators include two endemic snakes and several carnivores (from fossil records). Introduced species, such as cats (Felis domesticus), dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), black rats (Rattus rattus) and small Asian mongooses (Herpestes javanicus), are also potential nest predators. These species have proliferated due {{to the presence of}} human-developed facilities, mainly for communication purposes, in the Maricao State Forest and El Yunque National Forest. Two factors contribute to the destruction of the elfin woods warbler's habitat: humans and nature. Human-related habitat destruction includes the construction of communication towers, acquisition of timber, and expansion of roads and trails. Nature's contribution comes from natural disasters such as forest fires and hurricanes.|$|R
60|$|So, {{banished from}} our sight seemed all things uncongenial; and {{pleasant}} times were ours, in these dominions. Not a face passed by, but smiled; mocking-birds {{perched on the}} boughs; and singing, made us vow the <b>woods</b> were <b>warbling</b> forth thanksgiving, with a thousand throats! The stalwart yeomen grinned beneath their trenchers, heaped with citrons pomegrantes, grapes; the pages tittered, pouring out the wine; and all the lords loud laughed, smote their gilded spears, and swore the isle was glad.|$|R
50|$|Breeding birds include {{important}} {{numbers of}} waders such as lapwing and redshank. Little egrets have recently joined grey herons in the heronry. The woodlands hold redstart, <b>wood</b> <b>warbler</b> and pied flycatcher while red kites frequently pass overhead.|$|E
50|$|Small {{birds are}} {{reported}} in wooded areas such at nuthatch, chiffchaff, <b>wood</b> <b>warbler,</b> treecreeper, marsh tit, pied flycatcher, redstart and great spotted woodpecker. Resident waterfowl include moorhen, mallard and coot and breeding reed buntings have been reported.|$|E
50|$|Buzzards (Buteo buteo) {{regularly}} hunt {{over the}} tree canopy. Hobby (Falco subbuteo), woodcock (Scolopax rusticola), common firecrest (Regulus ignicapillus) and brambling (Fringilla montifringilla) are occasional visitors. Selborne Common is a reliable {{place to find}} the <b>wood</b> <b>warbler</b> (Phylloscopus sibilatrix).|$|E
50|$|The elfin <b>woods</b> <b>warbler</b> {{is one of}} {{many species}} in the genus Setophaga of the New World warbler family Parulidae. It was first {{observed}} in 1968 by Cameron and Angela Kepler while they were conducting observations on two Puerto Rican endemic birds, the Puerto Rican amazon and the Puerto Rican tody. On May 18, 1971, a specimen was captured in El Yunque National Forest, which at the time was believed to be its only habitat. A year later Kepler and Parkes described and named the species, making it the most recent warbler of the genus Setophaga discovered in the New World. Also, it is the first species described in the Caribbean since 1927 and the first Puerto Rican species described in the 20th century. The specific name, angelae, is a tribute to Angela Kepler. Elfin-woods warbler is an alternative spelling, and Reinita de Bosque Enano is the Spanish name. The species was initially placed in the genus Dendroica, but in 2011 the American Ornithologists' Union reorganized the classification of the family Parulidae and transferred species in Dendroica to Setophaga. This revised classification was adopted by the International Ornithologists' Union.|$|R
