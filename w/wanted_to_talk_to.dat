The hijackers, using the captain to speak for them, demanded the release of two Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) political party leaders, Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, who were in house arrest; the FIS was banned in Algeria in 1992.

25|$|Despite admitting {{throughout}} {{the work that}} he very regularly used EPO, testosterone pills and patches, and autologous blood transfusions (all banned practices), Hamilton staunchly opposed the sanction, since he had never used the blood of another person. It was speculated that Fuentes and his assistant had mixed the blood of another rider with his. His career in a shambles, he raced for lesser team after his suspension, tested positive for DHEA (in an OTC herbal anti-depressant) and retired. He later {{received a call from}} federal investigator Jeff Novitzky, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him. He refused and was served a subpoena, whereupon he decided to tell everything. Some former teammates of Lance Armstrong and other witnesses appeared, until the federal government dropped the charges. The USADA took over the investigation under civil law, and Armstrong was ultimately stripped of all his titles from August 1998 onward. He was also banned from bicycle racing and triathlon competition.|$|E
25|$|In early 1968, he was {{contacted}} {{by a friend}} from Chicago who said that Toyota wanted to establish a dealer network in the Southeast U.S. and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Jim Moran, who asked what a Toyota was. The company had been unsuccessful at breaking into the American market {{at the end of}} the 1950s and was trying again. Moran declined, but his friend was insistent that Moran drive one. According to Moran, he tested everything to see if it would break. While cruising at 55mph on the interstate, Moran shifted into reverse, and the engine and transmission survived. Moran concluded that although Toyotas weren't as stylish or comfortable as domestic vehicles, they were well-built, reasonably priced, and destined to change the automotive business. On October 26, 1968 he entered into an agreement to distribute Toyota vehicles from the port in Jacksonville, Florida to the states of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North and South Carolina. His Southeast Toyota Distributors (SET) was founded that year and in 2006, distributed over 400,000 vehicles, 20% of all new Toyotas sold in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In episode 6, Dylan calls Brenda {{while she}} is talking to Kelly and Ryan. When Kelly finds out it's Dylan on the line, she talks to him. It turns out that Dylan wants {{to try to be}} a family again with her and Sammy. However, this would mean they would have to move away from Beverly Hills. After much thought, Kelly breaks up with Ryan, as she said that she needs to try to work things out with Dylan. Ryan asks Kelly why Dylan would call Brenda's phone, not hers, if he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Kelly. Fearing Brenda and Dylan were {{secretly}} back together, Kelly confronts Brenda. After hearing Brenda say that her and Dylan's relationship is platonic, Brenda and Kelly make up. Kelly decides to try to repair her relationship with Dylan, while Brenda sadly deletes his number from her cell phone. It is implied {{that there may have been}} more to the story of Brenda and Dylan's relationship that she didn't share with Kelly, as Brenda shed some tears when deleting Dylan's phone number.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} {{was introduced in}} the Stargate SG-1 episode [...] "Enemy Mine". Kavan Smith had formed a close relationship with director Peter DeLuise before being cast. When the development of the episode was finished, there were no plans of expanding Lorne's role in the franchise. Smith himself felt the part would not [...] "necessarily" [...] lead anywhere big. Sometime after shooting [...] "Enemy Mine", the producers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Smith about the possibility of having him return to the spin off series, Stargate Atlantis. After the talk, Smith auditioned for a part, he won and received a different character. According to Smith, this {{character was}} more of a [...] "military guy", but the producers eventually decided to give Smith back his old character, Lorne.|$|E

[...] Mandela also {{requested}} a meeting with her, and she applied several times to visit him on the Island, but was declined each time. She was, however, at the prison gates waiting for him when he was released in 1990, and she was amongst the first he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> In 2007 Gordimer sent Mandela an inscribed copy of Burger's Daughter to [...] "replace the 'imprisoned' copy", and in it she thanked him for his opinion of the book, and for [...] "untiringly leading the struggle".|$|E
500|$|Several {{people were}} interviewed for the part, {{including}} Tom Jones, Robert Goulet, and Jerry Vale.

Behr thought he was so charming that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him about the role on the spot, but his friend talked {{him out of it}} as he felt that Darren would think he was insane. Surma got in touch with Darren at Behr's prompting. Darren initially rejected the role, having heard that the part was a singer. Darren's agent went back to him three times and eventually convinced him to read the script, which is when {{he fell in love with}} the character. He later called it a [...] "dream come true".|$|E

500|$|Pierce called Dawn Wells on July 8, 1976, {{to star in}} his film. She {{arrived by}} plane in Texarkana before noon the next day.

While filming the cornfield scene, Wells was almost attacked by a bulldog, but the crew scared it away by shooting at it. Wells <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> the real-life survivor of her role, Katie Starks, but Katie refused. The Town That Dreaded Sundown was Wells' fourth film and her second time working with Pierce. During her stay, she did not read the script; she relied on the director, instead. She said {{that was the way}} she wanted it. Wells explained, [...] "Acting-wise, it's an extremely emotional role. I didn't want to pattern my interpretation after anything. I wanted to go on my own feelings." [...] Being shot was a new experience for the actress. [...] "They planted a charge in the receiver, so I was standing there holding the phone, shaking, expecting the receiver to blow up in my face." ...|$|E
500|$|That same year, {{he played}} Gordon Brown in Peter Morgan's single drama The Deal (2003), about a pact made between Brown and Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) in 1994. Unlike his {{research}} for the fictional State of Play, Morrissey discovered that no politicians <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him for this fact-based drama, so he turned to journalists Jon Snow and Simon Hoggart. He also travelled to Brown's hometown of Kirkcaldy and immersed himself in numerous biographies of the man, including Ross Wilson's documentary films on New Labour in the year surrounding the 1997 election. When speaking to many of Brown's friends to gain insight into his [...] "private persona", Morrissey discovered that Brown was funny, approachable and charming, which were characteristics {{he did not see}} in his [...] "public persona". To look like Brown, Morrissey had his hair dyed and permed, and put on 2 stone (28lb/13kg) in body weight in six weeks. The director Stephen Frears originally wanted to cast a Scottish actor as Brown but was persuaded by other production staff to cast Morrissey.|$|E

Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through.

500|$|Although {{the film}} is not {{essentially}} experimental, at several points it undermines the narrative reality. James Bernardoni notes Allen's way of opening the film by facing the camera, which immediately intrudes upon audience involvement in the film. In one famous scene, Allen's character, in line {{to see a movie}} with Annie, listens to a man behind him deliver misinformed pontifications on the significance of Fellini's and Marshall McLuhan's work. Allen pulls McLuhan himself from just off camera to personally correct the man's errors. Later in the film, when we see Annie and Alvy in their first extended talk, [...] "mental subtitles" [...] convey to the audience the characters' nervous inner doubts. An animated scene—with artwork based on the comic strip Inside Woody Allen—depicts Alvy and Annie in the guise of the Wicked Queen from Snow White. Although Allen uses each of these techniques only once, the [...] "fourth wall" [...] is broken several other times when characters address the camera directly. In one, Alvy stops several passers-by to ask questions about love, and in another he shrugs off writing a happy ending to his relationship with Annie in his autobiographical first play as forgivable [...] "wish-fulfillment." [...] Allen chose to have Alvy break the fourth wall, he explained, [...] "because I felt many {{of the people in the}} audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them directly and confront them." ...|$|E
500|$|Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{has been}} {{assigned}} {{to set up the}} Halloween party by Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who wants {{to live up to the}} expectations set by Robert California (James Spader). Robert arrives with his son Bert (David Mazouz) and remarks that the party is more tailored to kids than adults. In response, Andy asks Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) to take over and re-tailor the party, much to Erin's chagrin. Andy also tells her that he wishes to speak with her at the end of the day. Worried that he intends to fire her, she asks Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) to help her make the party more [...] "scary" [...] and [...] "sexy", and he gives her a tape to show everyone. Gabe explains to the camera crew that the video is a Cinema of the Unsettling movie, an avant garde film genre defined by its disturbing images and absence of plot. Disgusted by the video, the office staff demand an explanation from Erin. In desperation, she shows them her idea for making the party more [...] "sexy": a card game with photos of genitalia. This only makes them more outraged, and Andy and Robert talk with Erin in his office regarding the incident. Erin admits her fears about their planned talk at the end of the day. Andy tells her what he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her about: he has reached a point in his romantic relationship where his girlfriend should be able to call him at the office, and that he wanted to clear this with Erin first since she handles all calls. Erin had not even known that he was dating someone, and is shocked to hear they have been out on 31 dates so far. Erin feels dejected and leaves.|$|E

On March 13, 1992, at the Munich, Germany show at Nachtwerk, Pearl Jam played Ten in its entirety in order midway through its set. The band would only do this again in 2016 at Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center, as the arena management homaged the band's tenth straight sellout concert in the city. Following the European leg, Pearl Jam did another tour of North America. Goldstone noted that the band's audience expanded, saying that unlike before, [...] "everyone came." [...] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, [...] "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening {{and there was no}} stopping it. To play in the Midwest and be selling out these 500 seat clubs. Eddie could say he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Brett, the sound guy, and they'd carry him out there on their hands. You hadn't really seen that reaction from a crowd before..." [...] When Pearl Jam came back for a second go-around in Europe the band appeared at the Pinkpop Festival and the Roskilde Festival in June 1992. The band cancelled its remaining European dates in the summer of 1992 after the Roskilde Festival due to a confrontation with security at that event as well as exhaustion from touring. Ament said, [...] "We'd been on the road over 10 months. I think there just came a point about half way through that tour it was just starting to get pretty intense. I mean just being away from home, being on the road all the time and being lonely or being depressed or whatever." [...] The band would go on to play the 1992 Lollapalooza tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soundgarden, Ministry and Ice Cube, among others.|$|E
