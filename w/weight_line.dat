50|$|The species pursued, {{under which}} conditions, will largely {{determine}} {{the weight of}} rod selected. Next, {{it is important to}} match the line to the weight of the rod. Using too heavy a line on too light on a rod, or vice versa, will dramatically affect casting performance. It may also permanently warp the rod blank. Generally speaking, you can safely go one line weight more or less (i.e. using an 8wt or 10wt line on a 9wt rod). There are also rods stamped with a range of weights. For example, a rod may be rated 7-8wt. This indicates the rod is designed for either a 7 or 8 weight fly line. There are also some rods rated for wider ranges (e.g. 8-9-10wt). The drawback to multi-rated rods is that compromises in flexibility or action are made in order to accommodate a wider range of line weights. For example, a rod rated for 8-9 <b>weight</b> <b>line</b> will be slightly stiffer than a straight 8wt but slightly softer than a straight 9wt rod. In general, the more expensive the rod, the more likely it'll be designated for a single line weight rather than a range.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Mortality {{during the}} early growing period of turkeys was {{increased}} by genetic increases in egg production in a medium <b>weight</b> <b>line</b> (E) but genetic increases in both 16 -week body weight and egg production in a large <b>weight</b> <b>line</b> did not influence poult mortality. Since mortality declined and egg production increased in a line selected for low plasma corticosterone level after cold stress at four weeks of age, {{it was believed that}} changes in some factor other than total egg production resulted in the increased mortality of the E line. A part of the increased mortality in the E line was attributed to decreased egg weight. However, only one percent of variation in mortality to eight weeks of age was accounted for by variation in egg weight. Hens producing a small (1 to 5) or large (16 to 20) number of poults in a four week hatching period had increased mortality. Since the E line had a larger percentage of high producing dams than the corresponding randombred control line, this factor contributed to the differences in mortality observed between the two lines. Hatching time was not an important factor influencing early poult mortality in the E line. Genetic increases in 16 -week body weight and semen yield did not influence mortality. Interactions between lines and years were frequently observed both with and without line differences in mortality. It was suggested that under certain environments genetic differences in resistance to death are expressed to a greater degree thus resulting in genotype-environmental interactions...|$|E

Chicks of each line were divided into three groups; (1) control, (2) exposure to 39 ± 1 ºC for six hour (h), form 5 to 21 day of age (DOA) on each of three consecutive d/week (HS) and (3) HS concurrent with 70 % feed restriction (HSFR). The results showed that quail chicks of either HS or HSFR exhibited significantly higher respiration rate (RR) compared with the control. While, the rectal temperature (RT) was reduced at 21 DOA, in the HSFR group. The plasma concentrations of total protein, globulin, total lipid, cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose were decreased due to HS or HSFR episode. Likewise, the level of both calcium and phosphorus at 21 DOA. However, at 42 DOA, the HS chicks did not significantly differ from the control.

40|$|Studying how {{changes in}} DNA affect organisms and gene functions, {{can give us}} an {{increased}} understanding of the genetic regulation of diseases and metabolic traits. Chickens and other farm animals have long {{been used as a}} tool to study human diseases and other complex traits since they provide an excellent opportunity to study these traits in a controlled environment. In this thesis I have applied new statistical methods to experimental data from two outbred chicken crosses to investigate the genetic architecture and regulation of autoimmune and metabolic traits. The first cross was generated from two chicken lines divergently selected for high and low body weight and was used to study how a four-QTL network affects metabolic traits (papers I-III). The second cross was generated to study the genetic regulation of autoimmune systemic sclerosis (paper IV). Our explorations {{of the effects of the}} four-QTL network on other metabolic traits indicate that the major contribution of the network is to increase body size through an overall increase in growth of all organs rather than by changing the relative size of different components. To be able to study the networks affect on metabolic traits further, we first generated and analysed an advanced intercross line to narrow down the regions. Once the regions were fine mapped, we designed and generated a so called introgression line. Three of the fine mapped QTL were transferred (introgressed) from the low <b>weight</b> <b>line</b> into a high <b>weight</b> <b>line</b> background. This introgression line can be used to further investigate the QTL network. In the second cross, three suggestive autosomal susceptibility QTL were mapped in the chicken genome, with several orthologues of human systemic sclerosis candidate genes located within two of these loci.

In the presence of MV, isolated mesophyll cells of BS 1 - 31 exhibited higher CO 2 fixation than the wild type. When the hydroxyl radical probe dimethyl sulfoxide was introduced into cells, the initial formation rate of methane sulfinic acid was significantly lower in cells containing mannitol in the chloroplast compartment than in wild-type cells, indicating an increased hydroxyl radical-scavenging capacity in BS 1 - 31 tobacco.

Wing-beat frequency, the major determinant of power output, is highly correlated with the rate of oxygen consumption.
