5|$|The {{major theme}} of Buffy's dream is {{her fear of}} the {{personal}} cost of {{her life as a}} Slayer, the isolation and loneliness she is forced to endure. This theme of aloneness is reiterated by several shots in which she is alone in the frame, most notably the <b>wide</b> <b>shot</b> of her in the vast and empty desert. Another source of anxiety is her relationship with her current boyfriend, Riley, whom she finds plotting world domination with Adam in his original, human, form. She fears what Riley could turn into {{as a result of his}} alliance with the military. She also fears the destabilizing effect of this alliance on their relationship, and the destabilizing effect of this relationship on her life as the slayer. She is shown putting mud on her face, mimicking the mud mask of the primal, First Slayer. By the end of her encounter in the desert with the First Slayer, Buffy realizes that she does not have to be entirely alone, that it is her closeness to friends and family that makes her a great Slayer, and once she experiences this revelation, the efforts of the First Slayer to continue to engage her in battle become fruitless and increasingly comical. The dream finally ends in a mundane way, as Buffy refuses to accept a tragic climax and instead insists on normality in her life.|$|E
25|$|In January 1962 the {{national}} Graham Kennedy's Channel 9 Show was cancelled {{and replaced by}} The Channel 9 Show hosted by Bert Newton. Kennedy continued to fine-tune his IMT performances. Kennedy had a strong understanding of key technical elements of television and perfected his comic timing, and watched the lenses on the TV cameras, adjusting his performance depending on whether {{he was in a}} <b>wide</b> <b>shot</b> or a close up. Compilation highlight programs of IMT segments were screened in Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide in May 1963 under the title The Best of Kennedy. The Best of Kennedy continued until December 1963. On IMT, Noel Ferrier was appointed the new Friday night host. Also in 1963 writer Mike McColl-Jones joined. Kennedy had often disliked having writers on the program, was reluctant for them to be publicly acknowledged, and often ignored all their material. In the case of McColl-Jones, Kennedy seemed to like him and his comedy material, which was apparently the key requirement by which Kennedy would use a writer's material. McColl-Jones continued as a writer on the series for several years. Also in 1963 Ernie Carroll joined the writing team. Kennedy had apparently relaxed his attitude towards writers by this stage and seemed happy to use their material with few complaints.|$|E
500|$|Abraham {{created a}} light-control system {{in an attempt}} to keep the {{overhead}} from being unflattering. However, after unsuccessfully attempting to implement the necessary wiring to control each light, the production team established controlling rows of light. Pat O'Mara, the key grip during production, installed several 2x1 and 2x2 blackout panels and frames that were retrofitted with small albeit strong magnets. During a scene when and actor or actresses stood under a fluorescent light, a panel or a frame was placed over the fixture, subsequently diffusing light onto their faces. [...] "If somebody was walking through the office in a <b>wide</b> <b>shot,</b> I just turned the overhead lights on. But if Don was talking to someone at his desk and the office was the backdrop, I turned all the lights on and then selectively removed some; then, I brought the key around with Kino Flo Image 80s through 4-by-8 frames of 250 or 216, or sourced my key with a larger Fresnel through the window." ...|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears wearing a short black {{bodysuit}} and knee-high black boots, {{standing on the}} roofs of a futuristic city. [...] As the first verse begins, she breaks into a research facility and battles with suited henchmen. Spears ends up gaining access to a highly secured laboratory and walks through aisles of clones held in liquid cocoons. She sees that one is a clone of her, kisses her and plants a bomb on the tank. After this, Spears infiltrates {{the base of the}} apparent villain, kissing him, and then destroying him, revealing him to be a robot also. From there, she dodges a bullet and sets off a panic among the newly arrived henchmen, meanwhile the bomb's timer runs lower and lower. Next, there is a <b>wide</b> <b>shot</b> of the building exploding, while Spears is jumping and [...] "Victory" [...] is depicted {{on the side of the}} structure. The video ends with the phrase [...] "To be continued...".|$|E
500|$|Kubrick would devote his {{personal}} breaks to having lengthy discussions with actors. Among those who valued his attention was Tony Curtis, star of Spartacus, who said Kubrick {{was his favorite}} director, adding, [...] "his greatest effectiveness was his one-on-one relationship with actors." [...] He further added, [...] "Kubrick had his own approach to film-making. He {{wanted to see the}} actor's faces. He didn't want cameras always in a <b>wide</b> <b>shot</b> twenty-five feet away, he wanted close-ups, he wanted to keep the camera moving. That was his style." [...] Similarly, Malcolm McDowell recalls the long discussions he had with Kubrick to help him develop his character in A Clockwork Orange, noting that on set he felt entirely uninhibited and free, which is what made Kubrick [...] "such a great director". Kubrick also allowed actors at times to improvise and to [...] "break the rules", particularly with Peter Sellers in Lolita, which became a turning point in his career as it allowed him to work creatively during the shooting, as opposed to the preproduction stage.|$|E
500|$|That same year, Crawford starred as Lucy Harbin in William Castle's horror mystery Strait-Jacket (1964). Robert Aldrich cast Crawford and Davis in Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964). After a purported {{campaign}} of harassment by Davis {{on location in}} Louisiana, Crawford returned to Hollywood and entered a hospital. After a prolonged absence, during which Crawford was accused of feigning illness, Aldrich was forced to replace her with Olivia de Havilland. Crawford claimed to be devastated, saying [...] "I heard the news of my replacement over the radio, lying in my hospital bed ... I cried for nine hours." [...] Crawford nursed grudges against Davis and Aldrich {{for the rest of}} her life, saying of Aldrich, [...] "He is a man who loves evil, horrendous, vile things", to which Aldrich replied, [...] "If the shoe fits, wear it, and I am very fond of Miss Crawford." [...] Despite being replaced, brief footage of Crawford made it into the film, when she is seen sitting in a taxi in a <b>wide</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E

500|$|A shot where Lester and Ricky share a {{cannabis}} joint {{behind a}} building {{came from a}} misunderstanding between Hall and Mendes. Mendes asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence; Hall assumed the characters would look for privacy, so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building, intending to light {{from the top of}} the truck. When Mendes returned, he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen. He removed the truck and Hall had to rethink the lighting; he lit it from the left, with a large light crossing the actors, and with a soft light behind the camera. Hall felt the consequent <b>wide</b> <b>shot</b> [...] "worked perfectly for the tone of the scene". Hall made sure to keep rain, or the suggestion of it, in every shot near the end of the film. In one shot during Lester's encounter with Angela at the Burnhams' home, Hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights; in another, he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower, intensifying the light (although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene, Hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced). For the close-ups when Lester and Angela move to the couch, Hall tried to keep rain in the frame, lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester. He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room.|$|E
2500|$|Gabriel {{was shot}} on a JVC GY-HD101E digital video camera. Abbess praised the JVC’s versatility, small size {{and its ability}} to shoot at night. Another crucial {{advantage}} to digital video was its cheapness: [...] "Ten years ago, we couldn’t have made this movie, because we would have had to shoot on film. It would have been as boring as bat shit, because we would only have had money to shoot a <b>wide</b> <b>shot</b> and two close ups before moving on. I got so much better coverage shooting it this way." ...|$|E

According to Moroboshi, {{because of the lack}} of Ultraman Factor, his fighting skills relies on weaponries, as well as his swordsmanship. The Spacium Sword is empowered by Spacium energies and is capable of slicing through harder materials such as Alien Bris' exoskeleton. Soon, the Ultraman Suit was upgraded into Ver.7.2, which gives him an additional Spacium, two machine guns that are stored in his shoulders and a pair of [...] cannons. The entire suit and its throwing knives are based on Ultraseven and his Eye Slugger. Meanwhile, the <b>Wide</b> <b>Shot</b> cannons is based on the similarly finisher attack of said giant warrior.|$|E
