5000|$|The iButton (also {{known as}} the Dallas Key) is a {{mechanical}} packaging standard that places a 1-Wire component inside a small stainless steel [...] "button" [...] similar to a disk-shaped watch battery. iButtons are connected to 1-Wire bus systems by means of <b>sockets</b> <b>with</b> <b>contacts</b> that touch the [...] "lid" [...] and [...] "base" [...] of the canister. Alternatively, the connection can be semi-permanent <b>with</b> a <b>socket</b> into which the iButton clips, but from which it is easily removed.|$|R
40|$|During system {{level testing}} {{intermittent}} and permanent open circuit failures of mated, crimp removable, electrical contact pairs were experienced. The {{root cause of}} the failures {{was determined to be}} low (but not zero) contact forces applied by the <b>socket</b> <b>contact</b> tines against the engaging pin. The low contact force reduces the effectiveness of the wiping action of the socket tines against the pin. The observed failure mode may be produced when insufficient wiping during mate, demate and small relative movement in use allows for the accumulation of debris or insulating films that electrically separate the contact pair. The investigation identified at least three manufacturing process control problems associated <b>with</b> the <b>socket</b> <b>contacts</b> that enabled shipment of contacts susceptible to developing low contact forces: (1) Improper heat treatment of the socket tines resulting in plastic rather than elastic behavior; (2) Overly thinned socket tines at their base resulting in reduced pin retention forces; (3) insufficient screening tests to identify parts susceptible to the aforementioned failure mechanisms. The results from an extensive screening program of <b>socket</b> <b>contacts</b> utilizing the industry standard contact separation force test procedures are described herein. The investigation shows this method to be capable of identifying initially weak sockets. However, <b>sockets</b> whose <b>contact</b> retention forces may degrade during use may not be screened out by pin retention testing alone. Further investigations are required to correlate low contact retention forces with increased electrical contact resistance in the presence of insulating films that may accumulate in the use environment...|$|R

50|$|A 3-way socket {{has three}} {{electrical}} contacts. In {{addition to the}} two contacts of the standard <b>socket,</b> a third <b>contact</b> is added. This contact is positioned off-center {{in the bottom of}} the <b>socket</b> (<b>contact</b> two in photo). This extra contact matches a ring-shaped contact on the bottom of a 3-way bulb, which creates the connection for the second filament inside the bulb. A problem of these devices is that the ring <b>contact</b> of the <b>socket</b> (<b>contact</b> two in photo) digs into the lead seal on the lamp bulb's contact ring and this connection tends to fail early (sometimes in months), leading to intermittent flashes, popping noises, and loss of power to the low wattage filament as the lead seal on the bulb's ring alternately melts and solidifies.|$|R

5000|$|On {{electricity}} networks {{with a system}} voltage of 240 V to 1.1 kV, which are mostly used in industrial / mining equipment / machines rather than publicly accessible networks, the earthing system design is as equally important from safety point of view as for domestic users. In most developed countries, 220 V, 230 V, or 240 V <b>sockets</b> <b>with</b> earthed <b>contacts</b> were introduced either just before or soon after World War II, though with considerable national variation in popularity. In the United States and Canada, 120 V power outlets installed before the mid-1960s generally {{did not include a}} ground (earth) pin. In the developing world, local wiring practice may not provide a connection to an earthing pin of an outlet. [...] For a time, US National Electrical Code allowed certain major appliances permanently connected to the supply to use the supply neutral wire as the equipment enclosure connection to ground. This was not permitted for plug-in equipment as the neutral and energized conductor could easily be accidentally exchanged, creating a severe hazard. If the neutral was interrupted, the equipment enclosure would no longer be connected to ground. Normal imbalances in a split phase distribution system could create objectionable neutral to ground voltages. Recent editions of the NEC no longer permit this practice. For these reasons, most countries have now mandated dedicated protective earth connections that are now almost universal.|$|R
