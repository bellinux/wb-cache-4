25|$|MBO {{situations}} {{lead management}} teams often into a dilemma as {{they face a}} conflict of interest, being interested in a low purchase price personally {{while at the same}} time being employed by the owners <b>who</b> <b>obviously</b> have an interest in a high purchase price. Owners usually react to this situation by offering a deal fee to the management team if a certain price threshold is reached. Financial sponsors usually react to this again by offering to compensate the management team for a lost deal fee if the purchase price is low. Another mechanisms to handle this problem are earn-outs (purchase price being contingent on reaching certain future profitabilities).|$|E
500|$|Hole toured with Marilyn Manson on the Beautiful Monsters Tour in 1999, but {{dropped out}} of the tour nine dates in after a dispute over {{production}} costs between Love and Manson, in addition to the fact that Hole was forced the open for Manson under an agreement with Interscope Records. Hole resumed touring with Imperial Teen. Love would later make claims that an additional reason the band left the tour was due to Manson and Korn's (whom they also toured with in Australia) sexualized treatment of teenage female audience members. Love told interviewers at 99X.FM in Atlanta: [...] "What I really don't like—there are certain girls that like us, or like me, who are really messed up... and they {{do not need to be}}—they're very young—and they do not need to be taken and raped, or filmed having enema contests... going out into the audience and picking up fourteen and fifteen-year-old girls <b>who</b> <b>obviously</b> cut themselves, and then having to see them in the morning... it's just uncool." ...|$|E

500|$|McCartney {{explained}} that the Beatles had only experienced sex with girls from Liverpool, but {{when they got to}} Hamburg the only women who hung around the clubs late at night were strippers, dancers, or prostitutes. Harrison (who was then only 17) called Hamburg [...] "the naughtiest city in the world". McCartney said: [...] "By the time you got to Hamburg, a girlfriend there was likely to be a stripper, so to be suddenly involved with a hard-core striptease artist, <b>who</b> <b>obviously</b> knew {{a thing or two about}} sex... it was quite an eye-opener." [...] Gerry Marsden—frontman for Gerry & the Pacemakers—remembered visiting a Hamburg brothel in Herbertstrasse with Lennon: [...] "We paid our money, went in and sat down. This guy came out with the biggest lady we had ever seen in our lives. She looked like a bus with a bra on. We ran out that door so quick we didn't hear it shut. I wanted to go back to get my money back but John said: 'No, we'd better not. Might cause trouble.'" ...|$|E
500|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{assertion}} that at least six of the suspected hijackers named {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks turned up alive, the so-called [...] "zombie hijackers" [...] claim. Der Spiegel offers an explanation for this apparent mystery: BBC News used as a source the Arab News, an English-language Saudi newspaper, which in turn had compiled reports from Arabic newspapers, of people <b>who</b> <b>obviously</b> had nothing to do with the attacks but happened to share the same names with some of the suspected hijackers. No photographs of the suspected hijackers had been released at this point in time, and thus a few cases of mistaken identity occurred. In one instance, a man with the name of Said al-Ghamdi had given an interview to Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper in Tunis, outraged that he had been portrayed by CNN as one of the hijackers. CNN had broadcast his photograph after doing research on their own and finding a Saudi [...] "Said al-Ghamdi" [...] who had received flight training in the United States. CNN had found the wrong suspect, which only became clear once the FBI officially released the photographs of the suspected hijackers.|$|E
500|$|Pauline and Arthur were {{generally}} {{seen as the}} most stable couple in the show, so Arthur's affair with Christine Hewitt (Lizzie Power) {{came as a shock}} to viewers. The storyline was long-running, beginning early in 1992 with the introduction of lonely divorcee Christine, who employs Arthur to tend to her garden. A romance between Arthur and Christine steadily develops throughout the year, facilitated by Pauline's lengthy absence—she is called abroad to tend to her crippled brother Kenny in early June, and she does not return until late September—in reality, Wendy Richard had to be temporarily written out of EastEnders to allow her to act in Grace and Favour. The build-up to the affair contains many twists and turns, starting with Arthur's rebuff of Christine's advances, then a confrontation between Pauline and Christine, which convinces Pauline of Arthur's innocence and leaves her feeling [...] "strangely sorry for the pathetic, lonely figure, <b>who</b> <b>obviously</b> drank too much". The episode in which Arthur finally gives into temptation and sleeps with Christine aired on Christmas Eve 1992; it was labelled [...] "The Bonk of the Year" [...] by the British press, and was watched by 24.3million viewers. In 2005, it was reported as the eleventh most highly viewed UK television programme of all time.|$|E

500|$|The first American {{trailer and}} {{international}} trailer of The Wolverine were released on March 27, 2013. Empire Magazine said [...] "This {{is all very}} encouraging stuff from director James Mangold, a man <b>who's</b> <b>obviously</b> not afraid of tweaking the original source material to serve his own ends." [...] The trailer was later attached to [...] The second American trailer was then released on April 18, 2013, and was screened at CinemaCon in Las Vegas, Nevada.|$|R

500|$|Julian Jarrold became {{attached}} {{to direct the}} film in early 2005. It was his second feature film, after Kinky Boots, which was released later that year. According to Bernstein, he [...] "liked [...] style as it was modern and visceral, and I just {{had a feeling that}} he was the right choice. This piece needed to be handed with delicacy but also {{with a certain amount of}} brio and Julian was able to bring those two things to the production." [...] The director began work on the project in early 2006, rereading the novels Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Persuasion and also reviewing Austen biographies such as Spence's book. Jarrold depended most heavily on the script, calling it [...] "a rich, witty and clever screenplay from someone <b>who</b> <b>obviously</b> knew his subject very well. It is a love story but much more besides. Kevin's screenplay has so many layers and interesting ideas. Apart from the love story I was very attracted by the themes of imagination and experience." [...] The director intended to [...] "bring Austen up to date by roughening her up a bit" [...] and adding [...] "more life and energy and fun," [...] opining that past Austen adaptations had been [...] "a little bit picture-postcard and safe and sweet and nice." ...|$|E
500|$|When Chotiner {{appeared}} before the subcommittee on May 2, he testified {{that he had been}} retained by the firm when it was seeking to expand to California, that he had conferred with Justice Department attorneys regarding the criminal charges, and that no special favors had been asked or given. Under questioning by subcommittee counsel Robert F. Kennedy, the younger brother of committee member and future president John F. Kennedy, Chotiner also disclosed that he had been retained by New Jersey mobster Marco Regnelli in an attempt to stave off a deportation order. He testified that he never discussed his clients with Nixon, and had not used the Vice President's offices for business purposes. In a press release, Chotiner fired back at Kennedy, suggesting that he had been subpoenaed for political reasons. Denying any influence peddling, Chotiner asked whether the subcommittee counsel could [...] "explain whether any influence was used in connection with his own appointment as attorney for a subcommittee of a committee of which his brother... is a member." [...] Patrick Murphy Malin, head of the American Civil Liberties Union concurred that requiring Chotiner to testify had [...] "overtones of political harassment." [...] Time magazine summed up the hearings, [...] "At week's end two points were clear: 1) Murray Chotiner had been sought out by, and had gone to work for, unsavory clients <b>who</b> <b>obviously</b> regarded him as a man of influence; and 2) on the basis of evidence so far adduced, he had been remarkably unsuccessful in wielding any." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{failing in}} its {{explicit}} aim, the 15 February global day of anti-war protests had many effects that, according to some, were not directly intended. According to United Kingdom left-wing anti-war activist Salma Yaqoob, {{one of these}} {{was that they were}} a powerful antidote to the idea that the war was a [...] "Clash of Civilizations", or a religious war, an idea she claimed was propagated both by Western leaders and reactionary forces in the Arab world. This is echoed in the words of former Hizb ut-Tahrir organiser Hadiya Masieh who said of the non-Muslims marching in London [...] "How could we demonise people <b>who</b> <b>obviously</b> opposed aggression against Muslims?".|$|E

2500|$|Tablets from Pylos record {{sacrificial}} goods {{destined for}} [...] "the Two Queens and Poseidon" [...] ("to the Two Queens and the King" [...] :wa-na-ssoi, wa-na-ka-te). The [...] "Two Queens" [...] {{may be related}} with Demeter and Persephone, or their precursors, goddesses who were not associated with Poseidon in later periods. An exception is the myth of isolated Arcadia in southern Greece. Despoina, is daughter of Demeter and Poseidon Hippios, Horse-Poseidon. These myths seem to be connected with the first Greek-speaking people who came from the north during the Bronze age. Poseidon represents the river spirit of the underworld and he appears as a horse as it often happens in northern-European folklore. He pursues the mare-Demeter and she bears one daughter <b>who</b> <b>obviously</b> originally had the form or {{the shape of a}} mare too. Demeter and Despoina were closely connected with springs and animals, related to Poseidon as a God of waters and especially with Artemis, the mistress of the animals and the goddess of, among others, the Hunt.|$|E
2500|$|In 1954, Lenny {{formed the}} Lenny Hambro Quintet. Over {{the next two}} years, {{the members of the}} quintet {{alternately}} included Wade Legge, Rene Hernandez, Eddie Costa, or Hank Jones on piano; Dick Garcia, Sal Salvador, or Barry Galbraith on guitar; Louis Barretto, Clyde Lombardi or Arnold Fishkind on bass; Eddie Bert on trombone; Mel Zelnick, Harold Granowsky, Gus Johnson Jr., or Sid Bulkin on drums; Jose Mangual, Ubaldo Nieto, and Ray [...] "Mongo" [...] Santamaria on Bongos/Congas; and Babs Gonzales' vocals. As a quartet, quintet, or sextet, a Lenny Hambro-led and named ensemble would continue as a group through 1964. Hambro's first two albums, both released in 1954, were largely ignored by both the public and the music industry. His later albums (released in 1955 and 1956) received mediocre reviews. Gramophone criticized Hambro as [...] "a thoroughly competent dance-band musician <b>who</b> <b>obviously</b> believes he is playing jazz," [...] and for [...] "blantant copying" [...] of Charlie Parker's phrasing. These uncredited reviews directly contrasted with a George T. Simon Metronome review of a Gene Krupa Band engagement at New York City's Bop City in March 1950, where the typically stingy Simon credited the band with [...] "a good sax quintet, thanks in part to Lenny Hambro's lead". In any case, Hambro would release no further recordings as a bandleader or headliner.|$|E
