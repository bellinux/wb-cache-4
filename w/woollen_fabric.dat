In the final part of the manufacturing process the cloth was hung outdoors on large structures known as tenterframes and left to dry, after having been conditioned by a fulling mill. Daniel Defoe wrote a detailed account of what he had been told of the gibbet's history during his visit to Halifax in Volume 3 of his A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, published in 1727.|$|E

6000|$|A novelty was {{introduced}} into registers in 1678. The law required (for purposes of protecting trade) {{that all the}} dead should be buried in woollen winding-sheets. The price of the wool was the obolus paid to the Charon of the Revenue. After March 25, 1667, no person was to be [...] "buried in any shirt, shift, or sheet other that should be made of woole only." [...] Thus when the children in a little Oxfordshire village lately beheld a ghost, [...] "dressed in a long narrow gown of woollen, with bandages round the head and chin," [...] {{it is clear that}} the ghost was much more than a hundred years old, for the act [...] "had fallen into disuse long before it was repealed in 1814." [...] But this has little to do with parish registers. The addition made to the duties of the keeper of the register in 1678 was this--he had to take and record the affidavit of a kinsman of the dead, to the effect that the corpse was actually buried in <b>woollen</b> <b>fabric.</b> The upper classes, however, preferred to bury in linen, and to pay the fine of 5L. When Mistress Oldfield, the famous actress, was interred in 1730, her body was arrayed [...] "in a very fine Brussels lace headdress, a holland shift with a tucker and double ruffles of the same lace, and a pair of new kid gloves." ...|$|E

5000|$|At {{the time}} of the Norman conquest, the area to the east of the River Monnow, and north of the River Wye, was in the area known as Archenfield, which lay within the Earldom of Hereford and was {{considered}} to be part of England; areas {{to the west of the}} Monnow, including the Overmonnow area, were regarded as Welsh. After the Normans built Monmouth Castle, the town of Monmouth gradually developed as a market town, a river port, and as a centre for the manufacture of iron goods and <b>woollen</b> <b>fabric.</b> By the twelfth century, development had taken place beyond the Monnow Bridge at Overmonnow, forming a suburb or faubourg. The mediaeval iron industry at Overmonnow resulted in the wastage of large piles of cinders; these [...] "cinder hills", which gave their name to Cinderhill Street, were removed in the eighteenth century. [...] The area was also known for the manufacture of <b>woollen</b> <b>fabric,</b> particularly Monmouth caps which were popular between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries, and as a result the Overmonnow area supposedly became known as [...] "Cappers' Town", although this has been questioned.|$|E

50|$|In the {{finishing}} process of manufacturing textiles, after the cloth is woven, {{it goes through}} processes such as washing, fulling, raising the nap and trimming the nap. After the nap is trimmed, the fabric is considered finished. The raising process, which draws out {{the ends of the}} fibres, is done on both <b>woollen</b> and cotton <b>fabric.</b> Flannelette is a cotton fabric that goes through this process. There are ways to 'raise the nap', most of which involve wire brushes such as raising cards. Originally, dried teasel pods were used and were still preferred for use on woollen cloth for a long time. <b>Woollen</b> <b>fabrics,</b> which must be damp when raising the nap, are then dried and stretched before the nap is trimmed or sheared. Cotton cloth goes straight to the shearing process, where the nap gets trimmed to ensure that all the raised fibres are the same length.|$|R

40|$|Handle-related {{properties}} of <b>woollen</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{have been demonstrated}} to be major factors affecting consumer buying attitudes. Handle is the combination of both textural and compressional attributes. Compressional handle has demonstrated processing advantages in woven and knitted fabrics. The handle of processing lots can be manipulated {{using a variety of}} technologies but direct manipulation of textural greasy wool handle pre-processing is still crude. On-farm, there is documented evidence that including handle assessment in a selection index provides additional improvements in genetic gain. However, the assessment of greasy wool handle is based on a tactile evaluation of the wool staple by sheep and wool classers, and its application is affected by a lack of framework that instructs assessors on a standard method of assessment. Once a reliable and repeatable protocol is developed, further understanding of the effect greasy wool handle has on final garment quality will be possible...|$|R
50|$|Within {{the study}} of economics, the term has evolved. Giacomo Becattini rediscovered the concept to {{describe}} the Italian industrial configuration of {{the middle of the}} 20th century. Since the 1980s, the dynamic industrial development in NEC (North, East and Centre) of Italy, where after the Second World War geographical concentration of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) raised up, led to an increasing attention to the Marshall' seminal works. A growing literature with an accompanying cloud of definitions of what is meant as an industrial district characterised the international dabate, e.g. Cluster. Industrial districts in Italy have a coherent location and a narrow specialisation profile, e.g. Prato in <b>woollen</b> <b>fabric,</b> Sassuolo in ceramic tiles or Brenta in ladies' footwear.|$|E

40|$|Classification of wasted woollen {{textiles}} {{on the basis}} of their colour is a basic approach for the supply of a raw material which does not involve the cost of the colouring process. Colour classification is a very difficult task, especially when a fabric is composed by differently coloured fibre (melange fabric). Many systems have been developed in the last years for colour classification of textiles. Unfortunately such colour classification systems are not able to correctly classify melange fabrics. In the present work a method for real-time classification of melange colour <b>woollen</b> <b>fabrics</b> is proposed. The provided approach, that is suitable also for classifying solid colour fabrics, integrates a Machine Vision (MV) system, able to acquire high resolution images, with a clustering algorithm capable of mapping the colour pixel of fabric images into a series of colour classes. The proposed system provides a colour classification with a misclassification less than 10 % when compared with the classification resulting from a panel of expert human operators. A comparison between the proposed method and some tools stated in scientific literature is also afforded...|$|R
