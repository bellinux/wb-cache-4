2500|$|A {{dot matrix}} printer or impact matrix printer refers to a type of {{computer}} printer with a print head that runs {{back and forth on}} the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like a typewriter. Unlike a typewriter or daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printer,</b> letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced. [...] Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create carbon copies and carbonless copies.|$|E
5000|$|The Apple Daisy <b>Wheel</b> <b>Printer</b> is a daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printer</b> {{manufactured}} {{and sold}} by Apple, Inc.

50|$|During the 1980s, Royal also {{produced}} consumer daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printers</b> like the Royal LetterMaster and Royal OfficeMaster 2000, the former being a cheaper model.|$|R
50|$|The CPT 4200 was {{followed}} in 1976 by the CPT VM (Visual Memory), a partial-page display-screen dual-cassette-tape unit, and shortly thereafter by the CPT 8000, a full-page display dual-diskette desktop microcomputer that drove stand-alone daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printers</b> {{were added}} to the line with a {{purchase}} of the business from Plessey in 1978. A joint project with Exxon yielded a series of solid ink printers. Dataproducts used Toshiba engines for their first laser printers in 1989.|$|R
50|$|The title's second {{claim to}} fame was its {{production}} via an extremely early form of desktop publishing, involving a typesetting program specially written for its BBC Micro computer and Juki daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printer</b> by Martin Tod and introduced {{as early as the}} first months of 1984.|$|E
50|$|In 1972 a team at Diablo Systems led by {{engineer}} David S. Lee {{developed the}} first commercially successful daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printer,</b> {{a device that}} was faster and more flexible than IBM's golf-ball devices, being capable of 30 cps (characters per second), whereas IBM's Selectric operated at 13.4 cps.|$|E
5000|$|Commodore also {{produced}} the DPS-1101 daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printer,</b> which produced letter quality print {{similar to a}} typewriter, and which typically cost more than the computer and floppy disk drive together. The MPS-1000 dot matrix printer was introduced along with the C-128. [...] Commodore 1526 is a rebranded MPS 802.|$|E
5000|$|Thimble {{printers}} {{are closely}} related to daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printers,</b> but instead of a flat wheel the petals were bent to form a cup-shaped [...] "thimble" [...] print element. Introduced by NEC in 1977 as their [...] "Spinwriter" [...] series, the replaceable thimbles each held 128 characters.|$|R
5000|$|The Diablo 630 was so {{successful}} that virtually all later daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printers,</b> {{as well as many}} dot matrix printers and even the original Apple Laserwriter either copied its command set or could emulate one. Daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printers</b> from Diablo and Lee's 1973 company Qume were the dominant high-end output technology for computer and office automation applications by 1980, though high speed non-impact techniques were already entering the market (e.g. IBM 6640 inkjet, Xerox 2700 and IBM 6670 laser). From 1981 onwards the IBM PC's introduction of [...] "Code page 437" [...] with 254 printable glyphs (including 40 shapes specifically for drawing forms), and development of Xerox Star-influenced environments such as the Macintosh, GEM and Windows made bit-mapped approaches more desirable, driving cost reductions for laser printing and higher resolution for impact dot matrix printing.|$|R
2500|$|Printing of {{documents}} was initially accomplished using IBM Selectric typewriters modified for ASCII-character input. These were later replaced by application-specific daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printers,</b> first developed by Diablo, {{which became a}} Xerox company, and later by Qume. For quicker [...] "draft" [...] printing, dot-matrix line printers were optional alternatives with some word processors.|$|R
50|$|LocoScript 2 was bundled {{with the}} Amstrad PCW 9512, {{introduced}} in 1987. This version was significantly faster, included a spell checker, and included support for {{not just the}} original dot matrix printer, coming bundled as standard with a high quality daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printer.</b> It could also format, copy and verify disks for itself, instead of requiring the user to switch to CP/M and use the Disckit utility. However, copying via LocoScript was much slower, because the word processor occupied more RAM than the CP/M system, leaving less space for the RAM disk and therefore forcing the copy {{to be done in}} smaller, more numerous stages. LocoScript 2 increased its character set to 400, and allowed users to define up to 16 of their own characters (none of which the daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printer</b> was capable of outputting).|$|E
50|$|The system offered linked {{text-editing}} work {{stations that}} shared a storage unit a central processor unit, CRT-based display stations (IBM 5253 and 5254), a daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printer</b> (IBM 5257) and an ink jet printer (IBM 5258). Depending on the model, {{from one to}} 18 display stations and from three to 12 printers could be attached.|$|E
50|$|The {{initializing}} {{codes for}} each model of printer {{had to be}} written into the application. To use a program such as Wordstar with more than one printer (say, a fast dot matrix printer or a slower but presentation-quality daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printer),</b> a separate version of Wordstar had to be prepared, and one had to load the Wordstar version that corresponded to the printer selected (and exiting and reloading to change printers).|$|E
50|$|Character matrix {{printers}} are {{a category}} of computer printers (typically impact printers) that place characters from a fixed character set anywhere onto a fixed grid of possible locations on the page. Examples of these are daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printers,</b> golf ball printers, teleprinters, chain printers, and band printers. A character printer prints one character at a time.|$|R
5000|$|As {{an impact}} printer, the term mainly refers to low-resolution impact printers, with {{a column of}} 8, 9 or 24 [...] "pins" [...] hitting an ink-impregnated fabric ribbon, like a {{typewriter}} ribbon, onto the paper. It was originally contrasted with both daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printers</b> and line printers that used fixed-shape embossed metal or plastic stamps to mark paper.|$|R
50|$|Brother Industries {{manufactured}} the Twinriter 5 (1985) and 6 (1987) printers which {{tried to}} overcome the limitation of the missing graphics capabilities of daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printers</b> by adding a dot matrix print head to the existing daisy wheel print head, with the former being used for letter quality printing and the latter for drafts and for printing symbols which were not present in the daisy wheel character set.|$|R
50|$|Dot matrix {{printing}} or impact {{matrix printing}} {{is a type}} of computer printing which uses a print head that moves back-and-forth, or in an up-and-down motion, on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the print mechanism on a typewriter. However, unlike a typewriter or daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printer,</b> letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced.|$|E
50|$|The Diablo 630 was a daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printer</b> (computer printer) {{sold by the}} Diablo Data Systems {{division}} of the Xerox Corporation from 1980. The printer was capable of letter-quality printing; that is, its print quality was equivalent {{to the quality of}} an IBM Selectric typewriter, Selectric-based printer, or similar quality printer. The printer was capable of this quality at a nominal speed of 30 characters per second (roughly twice the speed of the Selectric).|$|E
50|$|The Data Recall Diamond One {{was a word}} {{processing}} typewriter, designed and built by Data Recall Ltd at Dorking, Surrey, England in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The machine drove a Qume daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printer</b> via a serial interface at 35 - 55 characters per second, and used an 8-inch floppy disc drive capable of holding 250,000 characters. It was user programmable. Later models included the Diamond III, the Diamond Five (a.k.a. Diamond V), and the Diamond 7.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} text mode programs {{is that they}} assume monospace fonts, where every character has the same width on screen, which allows them to easily maintain the vertical alignment when displaying semi-graphical characters. This was an analogy of early mechanical printers which had fixed pitch (teleprinters and daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printers,</b> etc.). This way, the output seen on the screen could be sent directly to the printer maintaining exactly the same format.|$|R
5000|$|Over time, several {{different}} technologies were developed including automating ordinary typebar typewriter mechanisms (such as the Friden Flexowriter), daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printers</b> (dating from a 1939 patent, but {{brought to life}} in the 1970s by Diablo engineer David S. Lee) where the type is moulded around the edge of a wheel, and [...] "golf ball" [...] (the popular informal name for [...] "typeball", as used in the IBM Selectric typewriter) printers where the type is distributed over the face of a globe-shaped printhead (including automating IBM Selectric mechanisms such as the IBM 2741 terminal). The daisy <b>wheel</b> and Selectric-based <b>printers</b> offered the advantage that the typeface was readily changeable by the user to accommodate varying needs.|$|R
50|$|Dot matrix and daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printers</b> {{are also}} able to use carbon paper to produce {{multiple}} copies of a document in one pass, and most models feature adjustable impact power and head spacing to accommodate up to three copies plus the original printout. Usually, this feature is {{used in conjunction with}} continuous, prearranged perforated paper and carbon supplies for use with a tractor feeder, rather than with single sheets of paper, for example, when printing out commercial invoices or receipts.|$|R
50|$|A {{dot matrix}} printer or impact matrix printer refers to a type of {{computer}} printer with a print head that runs {{back and forth on}} the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like a typewriter. Unlike a typewriter or daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printer,</b> letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced. Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create carbon copies and carbonless copies.|$|E
50|$|A serial {{dot matrix}} printer {{is a type of}} {{computer}} printer with a print head that runs back and forth, or in an up and down motion, on the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like the print mechanism on a typewriter. However, unlike a typewriter or daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printer,</b> letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced. Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create carbon copies and carbonless copies.|$|E
5000|$|The IBM Displaywriter System 6580 was a {{dedicated}} microcomputer-based word processing machine that IBM's Office Products Division introduced in June 1980.The system {{consisted of a}} central processing unit, based on the Intel 8086, in a desktop case, a monochrome CRT monitor atop the CPU, a detached keyboard, a detached dual disk drive that used 8-inch floppy disks, and a detached daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printer.</b> The system booted from an 8-inch floppy disk that stored IBM's internally developed word processing software. The operator stored the [...] "documents" [...] (i.e., data files) on additional diskettes.|$|E
50|$|LocoScript's menu system enabled {{users to}} add, singly or in combination, {{a range of}} {{sophisticated}} typographical effects: monospaced or proportional character spacing; normal or double width characters and spacing; various font sizes; bold, underline, italics, subscript or superscript, and reverse video. All of these except those that affected font size and spacing were displayed on the screen. Reverse video was an on-screen reminder to the user and was never printed, while the other effects were printed, except on daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|By 1980 daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printers</b> {{had become}} the {{dominant}} technology for high-quality text printing. Dot-matrix impact, thermal, or line printers were used where higher speed or image printing were required and poor print quality was acceptable. Both technologies were rapidly superseded for most purposes when dot-based printers - in particular laser printers - that could print any characters or graphics, rather than being restricted to a limited character set, became able to produce output of comparable quality. Daisy wheel technology is now found only in some electronic typewriters.|$|R
5000|$|Daisy <b>wheel</b> <b>printers</b> {{operate in}} much the same fashion as a typewriter. A hammer strikes a wheel with petals, the [...] "daisy wheel", each petal {{containing}} a letter form at its tip. The letter form strikes a ribbon of ink, depositing the ink on the page and thus printing a character. By rotating the daisy wheel, different characters are selected for printing. These printers were also referred to as letter-quality printers because they could produce text which was as clear and crisp as a typewriter. The fastest letter-quality printers printed at 30 characters per second.|$|R
