5|$|However, {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the PowerBook100 did not last. Sales decreased, and by December 1991 the 140 and 170 models had become more popular because customers <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> more for a built-in floppy disk drive and second serial port, which the PowerBook100 lacked. By August 10, 1992, Apple quietly dropped the PowerBook100 from its price list but continued to sell existing stock through its own dealers and alternative discount consumer-oriented stores such as Price Club. In these stores, a 4MB RAM/40MB hard drive configuration with a floppy drive sold for less than $1,000 (more than $1,500 less than the similar 2MB/20MB configuration's original list price).|$|E

At the same time, travel time was reduced by 20 minutes, as the trains stopped at only three intermediate stations. Linx operated with different prices on the same route, depending on if the ticket was bought in Norway or Sweden. The company stated that this was in part because of a strong Norwegian krone, in part because Norwegians <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> more, and in part because the sales system in Sweden was more automated.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E

It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to €150million. His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona's pre-season competition. A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou. While Capello requested to loan Messi, a bid to buy him came from Inter Milan, who <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages. According to then-president Joan Laporta, {{it was the only}} time the club faced a real risk of losing Messi, but he ultimately decided to stay.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to estimate the potential demand for certified clams in Italy and to investigate the determinants of maximum amount that respondents <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for this product. Quantitative analysis was used based on 1, 067 face-to-face interviews collected in 3 Italian regions in the north bordering the Adriatic Sea (Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Veneto, and Emilia-Romagna) carried out during 2008. The consumers' willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> (WTP) is measured using a contingent valuation method. In order to estimate separately the determinants of the probability that respondents <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> and the maximum that they <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> a generalization of Tobit model was adopted. The results indicate that consumers <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a premium price mainly to purchase better quality products. The research provides some initial insight into consumers' WTP that can be useful for certified fish farming. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
