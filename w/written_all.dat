25|$|Gold parting {{had been}} well used {{throughout}} the ancient times {{but only in the}} Medieval period were clear and detailed descriptions of the processes <b>written.</b> <b>All</b> the archaeological finds of Roman and early medieval parting point to a solid state process using common salt as the active ingredient. The only large group of medieval parting vessels so far discovered were found at Coppergate and Picadilly sites in York. The pinkish-purple discolouration of the vessels showed them to have been used with the salt cementation process which removes iron from the clay as ferric chloride. Other vessel fragments are known from Carlisle and Winchester. Theophilus was a 12th-century German monk and in his book De Diversus Artibus gives the clearest description of the salt cementation process.|$|E

500|$|Mark Lepage of Blender {{claimed that}} Is This It {{is similar to}} the works of 1970s bands the Velvet Underground, Television and the Feelies. Pitchforks Ryan Schreiber {{suggested}} that, while the work of the Velvet Underground is an obvious inspiration for the Strokes, the band's only similarity to the other groups is the confidence with which they perform. AllMusic's Heather Phares concluded, [...] "Granted, their high-fashion appeal and faultless influences... have 'critics' darlings' <b>written</b> <b>all</b> over them. But like the similarly lauded Elastica and Supergrass before them, the Strokes don't rehash the sounds that inspire them—they remake them in their own image." ...|$|E

500|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} rumours began to {{circulate}} that Blyton had not <b>written</b> <b>all</b> the books attributed to her, a charge she found particularly distressing. She published an appeal in her magazine asking children {{to let her}} know if they heard such stories and, after one mother informed her that she had attended a parents' meeting at her daughter's school during which a young librarian had repeated the allegation, Blyton decided in 1955 to begin legal proceedings. The librarian was eventually forced to make a public apology in open court early the following year, but the rumours that Blyton operated [...] "a 'company' of ghost writers" [...] persisted, as some found it difficult to believe that one woman working alone could produce such a volume of work.|$|E
