He called attention to three aspects: the Navy policy that put {{the great majority of}} African Americans into segregated shore duty, the unsafe munitions handling practices and lack of training that had led to the catastrophic detonationand the unfair manner in which 50 of 258 men had been singled out as mutineers. when their actions concerning loading ammunition after the explosion <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>different</b> from the other 208 men. Marshall pointed to the men of Division One who had refused to load ammunition prior to August 9, but had been shipped out and given other duty, not arrested and court-martialled.|$|E

In addition, during the peak influenza months, the shelter occupants did not test positive for the flu virus and the researchers hypothesize that being isolated from others may have been the reason they were virus-free.

As the name Fur was already in use for the genus Fur of true flies, in 1951, Whitley replaced it with Furgaleus. The type specimen is a [...] long immature male caught off Mordialloc in Victoria, Australia. Other common names for the whiskery shark include Mack's whiskery shark, reef shark, shakey shark, and sundowner.

The square plots were 132 feet per side (40 m x 40 m), and the rectangular patches were 52.8 feet by 330 feet (16 m x 100 m). [...] Square habitat patches <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>different</b> from rectangular patches in meadow vole density. [...] Edge effects in patches of this size were not found, suggesting meadow voles are edge-tolerant. [...] Habitat patch shape did affect dispersal and space use behaviors. In rectangular patches, home ranges were similar in size to those in square patches, but were elongated.|$|E
2500|$|Sound {{production}} in catfish {{may also be}} correlated with fighting and alarm calls. According {{to a study by}} Kaatz, sounds for disturbance (e.g. alarm) and agonistic behavior <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>different,</b> which suggests distress sounds can be used to sample variation in agonistic sound production. [...] However, in a comparison of a few different species of tropical catfish, some fish put under distress conditions produced a higher intensity of stridulatory sounds than drumming sounds. Differences in the proportion of drumming versus stridulation sounds depend on morphological constraints, such as different sizes of drumming muscles and pectoral spines. Due to these constraints, some fish may not even be able to produce a specific sound. In several different species of catfish, aggressive sound production occurs during cover site defense or during threats from other fish. More specifically, in long-whiskered catfishes, drumming sounds are used as a threatening signal and stridulations are used as a defense signal. Kaatz investigated 83 species from 14 families of catfish, and determined that catfishes produce more stridulatory sounds in disturbance situations and more swimbladder sounds in intraspecific conflicts.|$|E
