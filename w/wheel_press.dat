40|$|Abstract. Pressing is an {{important}} part of precision seeding operation, which has {{an important}} effect on crushing soil. In order to enhancing the effect of soil crushing, some <b>press</b> <b>wheels</b> with flange rim are used. But further research is needed to evaluate whether the use of these <b>press</b> <b>wheels</b> affect the actual seeding depth that will affect precision seeding quality. Three kinds of <b>press</b> <b>wheels,</b> with the smooth rim, circular flange rim and rib rim respectively were designed, and the PFC 3 D discrete element method (DEM) software was used to simulate the pressing processes of these <b>press</b> <b>wheels,</b> and the contact force between the rim and soil, soil displacement and porosity were analyzed. It was concluded that the <b>press</b> <b>wheel</b> with the smooth rim is better than others in precision seeding operation...|$|R

5000|$|The Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles {{is a book}} {{collecting}} and bibliophile club run by, and primarily for, students at Oxford University. It was founded in 1950 {{by a group of}} young bibliophiles headed by John Granger, Bent Juel-Jensen and R. John Rickett, and the first meeting was held in Hilary Term of 1951. For fifty years the Society held regular lectures, visits and other events during the University terms, and many of the leading bibliographers, librarians, book collectors, booksellers and other literary figures of the period spoke to the Society or hosted visits. Many of the Society's junior members went on to become prominent figures in the world of books, and some later served as senior members of the Society. One of the most influential members was John Sparrow, Warden of All Souls, who encouraged a love of books and manuscripts in a generation of students, and hosted a termly [...] "Warden's Meeting" [...] at which members were encouraged to bring items from their own libraries to pass round and say a few words about; the tradition of the [...] "Warden's Meeting" [...] continued after 1986, when the Warden himself was too ill to host the meetings and, indeed, after his death in 1992. Another of the Society's traditions was the quality of the termly programme cards, often produced by the leading printers and private presses of the age, including the Oxford and Cambridge University Presses, the Rampant Lions Press, the Samson Press, the Fantasy Press, the Kit-Cat Press, Big <b>Wheel</b> <b>Press,</b> the Perpetua Press, the Incline Press, the Whittington Press, the Libanus Press, the Rocket Press, the Stanbrook Abbey Press and the Stamperia Valdonega.|$|E

This {{study investigated the}} effects of the combination of <b>press</b> <b>wheel</b> weight and soil moisture on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedling emergence and crop establishment. Also soil physical properties of the seedbed including soil moisture and bulk density were recorded. The experiment was conducted at Andika area, which is located on the north of Misjid Solaiman, Khouzistan province, in Iran. A factorial complete block design was applied with three levels of soil moisture 7. 1, 14. 3 and 20. 6 % and four levels of <b>press</b> <b>wheel</b> weights which were 5. 4, 8. 3, 10. 2 and 10. 5 kg cm - 1 of <b>press</b> <b>wheel</b> width. Also, the effects of different types of <b>press</b> <b>wheels</b> (rubber and metal type <b>press</b> <b>wheels)</b> and {{the effects of the}}ir weights on seedling emergence were evaluated. This rate was significantly higher (p=< 0. 05) where the combination of 14. 3 % soil moisture and the amount of 5. 4 kg cm - 1 width of <b>press</b> <b>wheels</b> were used. The rate of emergence was significantly lower (p=< 0. 05) where the combination of 20. 6 % of soil moisture and the amount of 10. 5 kg cm - 1 of <b>press</b> <b>wheels</b> were applied. The rate of 85 % seedling emergence was the highest (p=< 0. 01) where 14. 3 % of soil moisture was determined, whereas the lowest seedling emergence was measured 60. 5 % where the amount of soil moisture was 20. 6 %. Also, the wheel weight of 10. 5 kg cm - 1 width of wheel showed the lowest seedling emergence compared to other weight was used.

The chamfer forms a guide for the pressing movement, helping to distribute the force evenly around the circumference of the hole, to allow the compression to occur gradually instead of all at once, thus helping the pressing operation to be smoother, to be more easily controlled, and to require less power (less force at any one instant of time), and to assist in aligning the shaft parallel with the hole it is being pressed into.
