Band saw machines are not necessarily expensive, but the band saw belt expenses are enormous since they degrade much faster. However, without sensing and intelligent analytics, it can be only determined by experience when the band saw belt will actually break. The developed prognostics system {{will be able to}} recognize and monitor the degradation of band saw belts even if the condition is changing, advising users <b>when</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> best time to replace band saw. This will significantly improve user experience and operator safety and ultimately save on costs.|$|E
500|$|Conservationists {{disagree}} on <b>when</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> proper {{time to give}} up on a population that is becoming a hybrid swarm, or to try and save the still existing pure individuals. Once a population becomes a complete mixture, the goal becomes to conserve those hybrids to avoid their loss. Conservationists treat each case on its merits, depending on detecting hybrids within the population. It is nearly impossible to formulate a uniform hybridization policy, because hybridization can occur beneficially when it occurs [...] "naturally", and when hybrid swarms are the only remaining evidence of prior species, they need to be conserved as well.|$|E

In {{the beginning of the}} episode, there is a chocolate bunny on Shawn's desk. In Twin Peaks, Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) delivered the famous line [...] "Diane, I'm holding in my hands a small box of chocolate bunnies." [...] Gus then asks, [...] "Since <b>when</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> sound of opening and closing shades so disruptive that it needs to be alleviated?" [...] The character Nadine Hurley in Twin Peaks attempted to patent her silent drape runner invention. Someone from a website by the name of UnderTheNail.com sends Shawn and Gus an e-mail that says, [...] "Who killed Paula Merral?" [...] Twin Peaks famed the catchphrase [...] "Who Killed Laura Palmer?" [...] The killer also purposely placed clues in his victims' fingernail beds.

2500|$|After the {{compulsory}} retirement of Rev. Jones later in 1815, Boys {{was chosen to}} succeed him, also inheriting his responsibilities as Master of the Upper School on the island. The promotion did little {{to rein in the}} chaplain's strident nature as further council records attest. On 30 March 1817 the Council asked Mr Boys for an explanation of his conduct in refusing to take into the church a coffin for burial. He countered by claiming that the funeral attendees were pagans who were disrespecting the church. In 1821 the minutes recall an incident when the Reverend publicly accused a shopkeeper of being a liar and a spy, calling after him in the street: [...] "Blenkens, <b>when</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> green bag to be given out?"

2500|$|Wade Vroom, an [...] "occasional teacher" [...] at Delta {{alternative}} school, [...] "pinned up brochures {{meant to}} advise gay bar and bath house patrons on safe sex procedures" [...] in a grade seven and eight classroom. Liz Sandals, the minister for education, {{stated that it}} was [...] "totally inappropriate." [...] Sandals also stated, [...] "clearly, from what was described in the media, the materials that were being used are totally inappropriate and are in no way connected to the Ontario health and phys ed curriculum" [...] and [...] "I’m relieved that Toronto District School Board (TDSB) has gotten rid of the material and that the teacher {{is no longer in}} the classroom." [...] He had been [...] "ordered [...] to work from home pending an investigation." [...] Sandals called it a [...] "one off." [...] Sandals stated how this type of material would not be included in the new Ontario curriculum. Lisa MacLeod, the critic for education from the Progressive Conservative Party, stated [...] "parents have not asked for this type of sexually explicit information to be made available to their children. The fact that an Ontario teacher felt comfortable enough to post it speaks to the cozy relationship the Liberal government has with their unions." [...] MacLeod feels that the Toronto District School Board is [...] "clearly out of control when it comes to this." [...] She also stated that [...] "this {{is not the first time}} something like has occurred there - and I think the government really has to put their foot down and make it known that that type of material is unacceptable." [...] A spokesman for the school board claimed that the teacher had [...] "good intentions." [...] MacLeod criticized the spokesman and thinks that the school board should fire someone for the material being posted. The AIDS Committee of Toronto, who published one of the brochures, stated that the intended material published by them was for adults. The Toronto Sun asked in an article, [...] "if the teacher now being paid to be at home, or any adult, were to pass out this material in a park, would the police not be called?" [...] and <b>when</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> TDSB going to notify police about a brochure teaching children?"safer sucking tips?" [...] A spokesman for the board stated, [...] "At this time, police have not been notified." [...] Toronto Police Service investigated the brochures and decided that no charges would be pressed against Vroom because it [...] "didn't meet Criminal Code criteria to lay charges for exposing children to obscene material or corrupting the morals of children." [...] Vroom was later reinstated after the issue had been [...] "resolved." ...|$|E
