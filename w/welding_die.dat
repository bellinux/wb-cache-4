Si-doped diamond {{films are}} {{deposited}} on cobalt cemented tungsten carbide (WC-Co) <b>welding</b> <b>dies</b> using hot filament {{chemical vapor deposition}} (HFCVD) method, where tetraethoxysilane (C 8 H 20 O 4 Si) is introduced in the reactive chamber as silicon source by bubbling method.

The results show that silicon doping can reduce the diamond crystal size and residual stress of diamond films, and also increase the FWHM of first order diamond Raman line. The polishing time of diamond coated <b>welding</b> <b>dies</b> also can be shortened by silicon doping. Si-doped diamond coated <b>welding</b> <b>dies</b> possesses comparable practical application performance with conventional diamond coated <b>welding</b> <b>dies.</b> Compared with the nylon and WC-Co <b>welding</b> <b>dies,</b> the working lifetime of diamond coated <b>welding</b> <b>dies</b> increases 200 and 10 times, respectively...|$|R

The welding tool with flat shoulder was possible to fabricate the weld of ADC 12 and S 45 C with a thin reaction layer with less than 1 μm. However, the mechanical strength of the weld was lower than that of ADC 12. This is attributed to the microstructure of weld interface. Thus, material flow during FSW was enhanced by using a welding tool with a screw probe and a scroll shoulder. The fabricated weld by the welding tool achieved high weld strength equivalent to ADC 12. In this weld, uniform and thin reaction layer about 50 nm was formed on the weld interface...|$|R

5000|$|A spiral die is {{the most}} complex {{of the three major}} blown film die types. The polymer melt is evenly {{distributed}} into several feed tubes, which wind around a central mandrel. Each of these feed tubes is connected to the space between the mandrel and outer die walls; the feed tubes gradually diminish in diameter as they spiral around the mandrel. At the same time, the space between the mandrel and outer die walls is increased. This allows the polymer melt to layer and blend, resulting in a uniform melt profile free of <b>weld</b> lines. This <b>die</b> design produces the most uniform films, but is also the most expensive. Air pressure is introduced through the extrusion die so that after the polymer melt leaves the lip of the die, it expands in circumference. The tubing is also drawn along its length faster than it is being extruded. This leads to thinning of the film as it is expanded in both the draw (or machine) direction, and in the transverse (or hoop) direction. The ratio of the blown diameter to the extruded diameter is known as the blow-up ratio, and affects the resulting physical properties of the film, such as stiffness and strength. Film thickness and blow-up ratio can be varied by altering the take-up rate of the rollers, the internal pressure in the blown tube, and the melt extrusion rate.|$|R

The emphasis of this study is the influence ofpost-weld precipitation annealing heat treatment and aluminium die casting thermal cycling on metallurgical and mechanical properties. A series of specimens of 1. 2344 tool steel is prepared to which 1. 6356 maraging steel is GTA weld cladded. Analysis of weld microstructure and hardness is made in order to understand the metallurgical processes during heat treatment at elevated temperatures and at prolonged time. The Response Surface (RS) model for prediction of hardness after heat treatment is developed. To the edges of immersion test specimens 1. 6356 maraging steel is GTA welded. The edges are machined to the final edge geometry. Two specimens are tested in as-welded condition and two in optimally aged condition. Testing is preformed on developed immersion test apparatus, which enables the simulation of thermal fatigue during aluminium die casting. After completion of a particular number of thermal fatigue cycles the weld microstructure and hardness is evaluated. Based on these results a hypothetical model for prediction of precipitation annealing time during aluminium die casting is proposed. The results showed that tool heating takes place at 25 % of molten metal injection time, preparing conditions for precipitation annealing at 15 % of injection time, and precipitation annealing at 60 % of injection time. These results, together witha finite element (FE) model for prediction of tool temperature and RS model for prediction of hardness after precipitation annealing, enable accurate prediction of maraging steel tool hardness after particular number ofdie casting cycles and consequently in-service tool life...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand of cost efficiency and lightweight design {{can be considered}} as major drivers for the introduction of new materials and material combinations in the aircraft industry. Consequently new joining technologies and welding approaches are needed. Friction stir welding is one of these new joining technologies and can help to overcome typical welding problems, which are present when fusion welding or similar melting based welding technologies are enabled for hard to weld alloys or mixed material joints. This technology offers a great potential, when new aluminum alloys or even dissimilar alloys have to be joined together. Fraunhofer IWS has been working on friction stir welding for several years. The introduction and enhancement of a cost-efficient parallel kinematics concept, a so-called Pentapod, is the basis for several studies on the field of friction stir welding. With a great space to working space ratio and its five-axis processing capabilities, this versatile machine concept is appropriate for welding parts with a great variation in size and shapes as well as for joining 3 -dimensionally curved weld lines. The machine was advanced with newly developed control algorithms to operate the friction stir welding process force-, torque- and position-controlled. Furthermore all milling operations for pre- and post-weld treatments can also be performed within this machine. A detailed overview about the capability and potential of the machine concept, especially in terms of potential aerospace application will be given. The research focuses on the feasibility of joining large and flexible aircraft parts, new machine concepts, 3 D-welding as well as mixed material joints. Examples of recent projects which have been conducted by utilizing the parallel kinematics concept will be given.

Eaton promised to assist the ditch construction that would be critical to the colony's farms. Bankrolled by Horace Greeley, the Union Colonists secured 60,000 contiguous acres. On March 15, 1870, the executive committee named the town [...] "Greeley." [...] Gophers continually thwarted the 35-mile Canal No. 1 but, according to Union Colony minutes, Eaton would not give up.Eaton expanded his operations from farming into contracting, specializing in the building of irrigation canals and reservoirs, a business he heavily promoted as a means of bringing growth and wealth to Larimer and Weld Counties. In 1873, in association with John C. Abbott, he built what later became known as Larimer County Canal No. 2, which watered large areas of land west, south, and southwest of Fort Collins. Competition for water between Fort Collins Agricultural Colony and the Greeley became desperate and in 1874 almost led to gunfire. Ben Eaton and a few others calmed Greeley colonists with a commitment to divide the water according to need and a promise to deliver it. The promise was not necessary because it rained.In 1878 he began construction of the Larimer and Weld Canal, once known as the Eaton Ditch. The Larimer and Weld Irrigation Company was incorporated on March 10, 1879. The company's board of directors were James Duff, Hyde Sparkes, Benjamin H. Eaton, Thomas B. Dunbar, and Aaron J. Eaton. The capital stock, $200,000, was divided into two thousand shares at $100 each. [...] This was the largest and longest irrigation canal in the state, irrigating 50,000 acres.

40|$|Longitudinal {{weld seams}} are an {{intrinsic}} feature in hollow extrusions produced with porthole dies. The formation of longitudinal weld seams {{is a solid}} bonding process, controlled by the local conditions in the extrusion die. Being the weakest areas within the extrusion cross section, it is desirable to achieve adequate properties of these weld seams. In our research, {{the concept of a}} weld seam integrity indicator as a means of quantifying bonding efficiency is introduced. The value of this indicator depends on a number of factors: the material flow within the <b>die</b> <b>weld</b> chambers, an adequate pressure level acting on the weld planes and finally the evolution of the metal microstructure. Optimisation of the welding conditions leads to a higher value of the weld seam integrity indicator and thus to improved weld seam properties. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to assess the feasibility of this concept. In lab-scale experiments, AA 6060 and AA 6082 aluminium alloy billets were formed into strips by means of the direct hot extrusion process. By utilising porthole dies a central longitudinal weld seam is formed. The effect of different geometries of the weld chamber and the processing conditions {{on the quality of the}} weld seam are investigated. Characterisation of these weld seams through mechanical testing, focusing on the ability of the weld seam area to accommodate plastic deformation following the onset of plastic instability, and microstructural analysis provides insight into bonding performance. The outcome of this characterisation provides a basis for an estimation of the weld seam indicator. Through computer modelling, the particular process conditions related to weld seam formation are calculated and correlated with the experimental results. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that weld seam formation is controlled by a combination of factors as described above. Inadequate fulfilment of these conditions, verified by the FEsimulations, is the cause of inferior weld seams, associated with low values of the weld seam integrity indicator. Through further elaboration of the concepts presented in this work, the weld seam integrity indicator is to be developed, with the future aim of predicting the weld seam performance through finite element simulations. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications...|$|R
