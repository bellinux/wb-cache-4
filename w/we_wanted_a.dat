500|$|The band {{wanted to}} avoid repeating the {{protracted}} recording process of their previous album In Rainbows (2007). Singer Thom Yorke said the band had felt that [...] "if we are gonna carry on, {{we need to do}} it for a new set of reasons." [...] Cover artist Stanley Donwood said: [...] "In Rainbows was very much a definitive statement, and that isn't where the band are at the moment. Where they are now is more transitory ... this album shows where Radiohead are at the moment the record was released. The music is a continuing thing. And we wanted to make the album representative of that." [...] Multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood told Rolling Stone that the band had not wanted to [...] "pick up guitars and write chord sequences. We didn't want to sit {{in front of a computer}} either. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> third thing, which involved playing and programming." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{months after}} the airing of the fourth season finale episode, co-showrunner and {{executive}} producer Robert Carlock was asked if Jack McBrayer's character Kenneth Parcell would return in the upcoming season after he was fired as an NBC page in [...] "I Do Do". Carlock said [...] "We haven't cracked [...] he is getting [...] back, {{but of course he}} will get back somehow. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> fun thing to shuffle the deck a little bit and send him off into the world. Of course, he will miss it and he will be missed. Events will bring him back." [...] In [...] "The Fabian Strategy", Kenneth is now working at CBS as a page for the Late Show with David Letterman. The scene in which Kenneth throws himself in front of a car to prove to Tracy Jordan that he is real and not Tracy's imagination was filmed on August 27, 2010, in front of the Ed Sullivan Theater.|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin {{revealed}} that the song was written in mid-2004 and was inspired by Martin's daughter, Apple, and English alternative rock singer Kate Bush: [...] "That's a song where we were listening {{to a lot of}} Kate Bush last summer, and <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> song which had a lot of tom-toms in it. I just had my daughter up also, and was kind of feeling in a sense of awe and wonderment, so the song is kind of a Kate Bush song about miracles." [...] The drumbeat of the song was inspired by Bush's 1985 song [...] "Running Up that Hill". In a separate interview, bassist Guy Berryman said: [...] "We were really trying to recreate the drums on that song for this song, and the chords. Some bands are reluctant to admit that they take things from other artists and bands that they listen to and we're shameless in that respect, we don't mind telling." ...|$|E

500|$|Dogmeat was {{inspired}} by the unnamed dog of Max Rockatansky (Mad Max) from the 1981 post-apocalyptic film Mad Max 2. His initial name had been [...] "Dogshit" [...] and his ultimate name was derived from the opening scene of the 1975 post-apocalyptic film A Boy and His Dog, in which the main character Vic calls his dog Blood [...] "dog meat". According to Fallout producer, lead programmer and designer Tim Cain, [...] "Leonard Boyarsky, the [...] art director ... had that movie running continuously in his office, and I think he remarked on several occasions that having a dog in the game would be really cool. [...] why <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> dog in the first place." [...] Fallout programmer and designer Jesse Heinig was credited by Cain as probably [...] "one person to thank for Dogmeat." [...] Heinig himself said: [...] "My understanding is that [...] Scott Bennie settled on the name 'Dogmeat' for the character, and it's likely that he did pick that from the story in question." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{a scratch}} match {{at the start}} of the 1859 {{football}} season, the Melbourne Football Club officially came into being on 14 May. Three days later, Wills and three other members—Hammersley, journalist J. B. Thompson and teacher Thomas H. Smith—met near the MCG at the Parade Hotel, owned by Bryant, to devise and codify the club's rules. The men went over the rules of four English schools; Hammersley recalled Wills' preference for the Rugby game, but it was found to be confusing and too violent. Subsequently, they rejected common features such as [...] "hacking" [...] (shin-kicking) and produced a signed document listing ten simple rules suited to grown men and Australian conditions. Heading the list of signatories, Wills, too, saw the need for compromise. He wrote to his brother Horace: [...] "Rugby was not a game for us, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> winter pastime but men could be harmed if thrown on the ground so we thought differently." [...] Thompson and Hammersley's promotion of the new code, together with Wills' star power, encouraged the spread of football throughout Victoria.|$|E
500|$|Full {{production}} {{began on}} Chrono Cross in mid-1998. The Chrono Cross team reached 80 members at its peak, with additional personnel of 10–20 cut-scene artists and 100 quality assurance testers. The team felt pressure {{to live up}} to the work of Chrono Triggers [...] "Dream Team" [...] development group, which included famous Japanese manga artist Akira Toriyama. Kato and Tanaka hired Nobuteru Yūki for character design and Yasuyuki Honne for art direction and concept art. The event team originally envisioned a short game, and planned a system by which players would befriend any person in a town for alliance in battle. Developers brainstormed traits and archetypes during the character-creation process, originally planning 64 characters with unique endings that could vary in three different ways per character. Kato described the character creation process: [...] "Take Pierre, for example: we started off by saying <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> wacko fake hero like Tata from Trigger. We also said things like 'we need at least one powerful mom', 'no way we're gonna go without a twisted brat', and so on so forth." ...|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers made {{extensive}} use of macro photography. Production designer Shepherd Frankel said, [...] "It's more visually interesting to depict things from Ant-Man's point of view instead of seeing him from a normal perspective. But <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> realistic realization, not Honey, I Shrunk the Kids with its oversized set pieces." [...] Rebecca Baehler served {{as the director of}} macro photography, taking cues from Carpenter. Carpenter said vibration became [...] "a tremendous problem" [...] when moving the camera during the macro photography because [...] "one inch off the ground is like fifteen feet in the air. From an ant's perspective, you move four inches, to a human perspective, that's a football field!" [...] The solution required the filmmakers to search for a creative solution, so they turned to Baehler, who had a background in commercial [...] "tabletop" [...] photography. In order to add Rudd's performance as Ant-Man when in the macro world, a Centroid facial capture set up was used, with a five-camera array of Alexas surrounding Rudd. Rosenfeld explained, [...] "One camera was set up vertically while the others were horizontal with overlapping image areas, all set to record at 48 frames per second. This maximized resolution and provided 3D modeling [...] Paul's performance." [...] Reed would then call out story moments with Rudd performing [...] "facial expressions that would later be composited on a CG Ant-Man." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video screens}} showed both live shoots and special footage {{directed}} by Robson. Cohen worked by Danny O'Brien at BCC Video to create double-sided custom video LED cubes that hanged above stage right. There were three larger-sized video screens above the stage area. The gyrating wheel in which Spears opened {{the show was}} made by Branam Enterprises and was attached to a platform also created by Tait Towers. 171 white light [...] were provided by Spectra. The giant music box from which Spears emerged in [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] (1999) was designed by Michael Cotton. Confetti was shot from machines provided by Pyrotek. Pyrotechnics were done by Gerb Fountains, whereas artificial snow was provided by Little Blizzard. During the encore performance of [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), there was a water screen {{in which it was}} poured nearly two tons of water pumped at 360 gallons a minute. Cohen said, [...] "The water screen is the keystone of the entire design because it impacts every system—electrics, staging, dancing. Rob discovered the company (Chameleon Productions of Orlando, Florida) that makes the screen, and I immediately looked at what they had in stock, which was a straight line. And I knew we didn't want a straight line. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> circular water screen so we could physically build a shower for her to stand in the middle of and not get wet and then walk through when she wanted to. Of course, everyone thought I was crazy, so I suggested a six-sided shape. Everyone was concerned that the gaps between the sections might cause gaps in the actual sheets of water. But I kept saying that if you put them 40' to 50' up in the air, gravity will cause the water to attach to itself, so you end up getting a solid sheet." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{choosing}} {{candidates for}} the Tatsunoko and Capcom character rosters, the development team was free to nominate any character it wished. However, the team faced limitations on its Tatsunoko candidates; Niitsuma explained, [...] " [...] had to consider licensing issues. Once we had that list we {{had to figure out}} how to make a balanced fighting game. On top of that <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> good balance between male and female characters." [...] Selection emphasis was placed on main characters, rather than on villains. Certain characters were denied by Tatsunoko Production without explanation to Capcom. [...] "We weren't privy to a lot of their decision making process. They didn't share a lot of reasons with us. When they said no and we asked why, they wouldn't tell us, but would give us another suggestion," [...] Niitsuma said. They disallowed characters from Genesis Climber MOSPEADA or Samurai Pizza Cats, despite the high number of fan requests for the latter. The eponymous characters of Tatsunoko's Muteking, The Dashing Warrior and Nurse Witch Komugi were among those planned for inclusion, but were eventually scrapped. The finalized Tatsunoko cast consists of characters that the team enjoyed in their youth. The development team hoped to include Capcom's Phoenix Wright and Franziska von Karma from the Ace Attorney series, but, while the latter's use of a whip made her easy to incorporate, the team struggled to find appropriate attacks for Phoenix. Since Phoenix doesn't move from the waist down in his original game environment, the team considered adding tires to his desk and having the entirety move as a single character. However, this was abandoned due to potential collision issues. Though they envisioned an attack that used his catch-phrase [...] "", with the letters themselves used to attack the opponent, they found that localization would have changed the Japanese four-character phrase (in kanji) to a ten-letter word in English, unbalancing the game. Arthur from Ghosts 'n Goblins, and Ingrid from Capcom Fighting Evolution were also scrapped.|$|E

The strident guitar chord was the perfect launch," [...] having what Ian MacDonald called [...] "a significance in Beatles lore matched only by the concluding E major of [...] "A Day in the Life", the two opening and closing the group's middle period of peak creativity".|$|E
2500|$|By 1994 Cheney and Owen {{were writing}} their own {{material}} {{and decided to}} change the band's name to The Living End – {{a reference to the}} film, Rock Around the Clock (1956).

We were still into the whole '50s thing, but <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> neutral name, one that didn't suggest any one style of music". With Cheney on lead guitar and lead vocals, and Owen on double bass and backing vocals, the group settled on Joe Piripitzi as their drummer. Cheney considered Piripitzi to be ideal due to his charismatic appearance.|$|E

Esther Shapiro said that an inspiration for the show was I, Claudius, a fictionalized depiction of the Julio-Claudian dynasty of Roman emperors. Shapiro said in 1985, [...] "We {{wanted to do something}} that would be fun, an American fantasy. We thought people had seen enough stories where families fell apart. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> strong, nineteenth-century sort of family where people were in conflict but loved each other in spite of everything." ...|$|E
