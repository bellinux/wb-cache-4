25|$|When {{there is}} a talk about women and Buddhism, I have noticed that people often regard the topic as {{something}} new and different.

However, {{this is not the}} case. The female sangha has been here for centuries. We are not bringing something new into a 2,500-year-old tradition.

25|$|In 1953, James {{was forced}} to leave the US under threat of {{deportation}} for having overstayed his visa. In his attempt to remain in America, James wrote a study of Herman Melville, Mariners, Renegades and Castaways: The Story of Herman Melville and the World <b>We</b> <b>Live</b> <b>In,</b> and had copies of the privately published work sent to every member of the Senate. He wrote the book while being detained on Ellis Island. In an impassioned letter to his old friend George Padmore, James said that in Mariners that he was using Moby Dick as a parable for the anticommunism sweeping the United State, a consequence, he thought, of Americans' uncritical faith in capitalism.|$|E

25|$|Williams {{released}} a statement on social media branding the comments about her unborn child as racist, noting that it saddened her that <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> a society where these comments can be made. Năstase then apologised on social media regarding the comments he made about Williams, but made comments about Konta speaking to the umpire which upset him. In a further interview with the BBC, Năstase justified his comments to Konta stating that he only abused her after being ejected from the court and did so as a fan rather than a captain. Năstase additionally added that he regretted his behaviour in the incident. Nastase was not invited to the French Open and Wimbledon following his suspension. The Madrid Open however invited Nastase {{to be part of}} the prize giving ceremony, which ironically was won by Halep (another Romanian player). This was a move that was deemed irresponsible by the WTA who had revoked Nastase's privileges while the ITF carried out its investigation.|$|E
25|$|The Congress {{believes}} that the Plan of Action formulated by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment at Stockholm in 1972 will influence forestry development throughout {{the world in the}} years to come. Recognizing that in many countries declared forest policies are not in accord with new knowledge, new preoccupations and new aspirations, the Congress considers it is now urgent to redefine forest policies in view of these new circumstances. The Congress firmly {{believes that}}, whatever the political objectives, whatever the form of economic organization, whatever the present pattern of forest land tenure, governments are responsible for planning the continuous flow of the productive, protective and social goods and services from the forest, ensuring that the physical output and environmental benefits of the forests are available for the general welfare of their peoples now and for all time. Since <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> one world, and since the forest resources of the world are unevenly distributed, national policies and plans must take account of the international context.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, {{industrialisation}} in Germany must {{be considered}} to have been positive in its effects. Not only did it change society and the countryside, and finally the world...it created the modern world <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in.</b> It solved the problems of population growth, under-employment and pauperism in a stagnating economy, and abolished dependency on the natural conditions of agriculture, and finally hunger. It created huge improvements in production and both short- and long-term improvements in living standards. However, {{in terms of social}} inequality, it can be assumed that it did not change the relative levels of income. Between 1815 and 1873 the statistical distribution of wealth was on the order of 77% to 23% for entrepreneurs and workers respectively. On the other hand, new problems arose, in the form of interrupted growth and new crises, such as urbanisation, 'alienation', new underclasses, proletariat and proletarian misery, new injustices and new masters and, eventually, class warfare.|$|E

25|$|Looking at {{that picture}} today makes me cringe. It {{was done in}} the worst {{possible}} taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done everything in my power to stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> today—brutally trampling upon {{the heart and soul of}} innocence.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} four organizations {{at the airport}} that offer fixed based operator services for general aviation users. One name familiar to the area <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> also resides in Kalamazoo. Duncan Aviation, which {{is located on the}} west side of the airfield, offers a large variety of services as it is the only full-service fixed based operator on the field. Duncan handles the traditional FBO services such as fueling. Maintenance, hangaring, aircraft movement, and many other ground services while also providing weather equipment and crew rest areas for pilots. They also offer passenger service such as rental and courtesy cars, restrooms vending, and a lobby area. The Duncan facility is the terminal for entrance to the general aviation side of the airport. Kalamazoo Aircraft is another major fixed based operator at the airport that offers maintenance services to smaller general aviation aircraft; they offer inspections, maintenance, repairs, and alterations. The third FBO on the field is the Kalamazoo Pilots Association which operates a self-service fueling pump in the hangar area. The last fixed based operator is Aviation Assets which conducts a flight training school on the north side of the airport.|$|E
