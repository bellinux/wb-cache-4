Comparative results for flank milled samples are also given together with associated micrographs detailing workpiece subsurface integrity and fracture initiation. Despite a marginally higher S-N response for the milled specimens compared to the <b>wire</b> <b>machined</b> samples when subject to a finishing regime, linear regression statistical analysis suggested {{no significant difference in}} performance at the 5 % level based on slope responses. Micrographs showing sample crack initiation sites and fatigue crack growth paths suggest a 40 - 50 μm altered zone in fracture surfaces for milled specimens with fatigue striations defining the crack path. For WEDM surfaces, crack initiation was in some cases due to defects below the machined surface, with secondary cracks probably due to local stresses...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTitanium and its alloys {{have found}} very wide {{application}} in aerospace {{due to their}} excellent characteristics although their processing is still a challenge. Electrochemical machining {{is an important issue}} in the fabrication of titanium and titanium alloys. <b>Wire</b> electrochemical <b>machining</b> (WECM) is mainly used for workpiece cutting under the condition of different thickness plates. It has a great advantage over <b>wire</b> electro-discharge <b>machining,</b> which is the absence of heat-affected zone around the cutting area. Moreover, the wire electrode in WECM could be used repetitively because it is not worn out. Thus, much {{attention has been paid to}} WECM. The effective way of removing electrolysis products is of importance to WECM. In this paper, the axial electrolyte flushing is presented to WECM for removing electrolysis products and renewing electrolyte. The Taguchi experiment is conducted to optimize the machining parameters, such as <b>wire</b> feedrate, <b>machining</b> voltage, electrolyte concentration, etc. Experimental results show that WECM with axial electrolyte flushing is a promising issue in the fabrication of titanium alloy (TC 1). The feasibility of multi-wire electrochemical machining is also demonstrated to improve the machining productivity of WECM...|$|R
