The first reactor design utilised a 2 mm x 20 mm channel which held a catalyst support structure made from wire mesh or metal foam which also created microchannel type flow spaces. The second reactor design consisted of various numbers of 0. 3 - 3 mm wide wire-cut microchannels in a thin stainless steel shim plate. Catalysts formed in the first reactor design using <b>washcoating</b> or solution combustion synthesis methods were found to agglomerate forming large particles which presented no detectable activity for the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Forming the catalysts for this reactor ex-situ using electrochemical deposition was successful in producing fine microstructures of catalyst which were initially active for the reaction.
