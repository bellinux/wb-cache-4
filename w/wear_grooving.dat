40|$|The micro-wear {{behavior}} of commercial pure Ti was investigated {{before and after}} processing by high pressure torsion (HPT) to provide comparisons over a range of grain sizes. The HPT-processed Ti had an average grain size of ? 130 nm while the as-received and HPT plus annealed samples had grain sizes of ? 8. 6 m and ? 607 nm, respectively. The results show all Ti samples have a similar dynamic coef?cient of friction but different wear mechanisms. Wear of the coarse grained (CG) Ti showed extensive plastic deformation and wedge formation which produced large wear debris whereas wear of the ultra-?ne grained (UFG) Ti was dominated by abrasive wear mechanisms and produced small wear debris. In addition, the UFG Ti showed a more homogenous <b>wear</b> <b>grooving</b> and a lower wear rate than CG Ti which suggests that UFG Ti is more suitable for wear applications. <br/...|$|E
30|$|Intermediate casings in the build {{sections}} {{are subject}} to severe wear in extended-reach drilling. This paper presents a new method for predicting the depth of a <b>wear</b> <b>groove</b> on the intermediate casing. According to energy principle and dynamic accumulation of casing wear by tool joints, a model is established to calculate the wear area on the inner wall of the casing. The relationship functions between the <b>wear</b> <b>groove</b> depth and area are obtained based on the geometry relationship between the drillstring and the wear section and {{the assumption that the}} casing <b>wear</b> <b>groove</b> is crescent-shaped. The change of casing <b>wear</b> <b>groove</b> depth versus drilling footage under different-sized drillstrings is also discussed. A mechanical model is proposed for predicting casing wear location, which is based on the well trajectory and drillstring movement. The casing <b>wear</b> <b>groove</b> depth of a planned well is predicted with inversion of the casing wear factor from the drilled well and necessarily revised to improve the prediction accuracy for differences between the drilled well and the planned well. The method for predicting casing wear in extended-reach drilling is verified through actual case study. The effect of drillstring size on casing wear should be taken into account in casing wear prediction.|$|R

Novel {{metallic}} matrix composite materials for wear resistant coatings {{based on the}} Fe-Cr-C-NbC system were developed using a laser assisted rapid-alloy-prototyping technique based on variable powder feed rate laser cladding.

This paper proposes an efficient design of an array of micro grooves useful for the deposition of alternate hard and soft nanocoatings which will help to characterize and analyze wear zones of WC inserts. The proposed design of the grooves on tool inserts helps to deposit various nanocoatings which act as a lubricating medium and helps the tool to reduce friction and <b>wear.</b> <b>Grooves</b> were designed based on the chip flow path.

This in turn reduces the wastage of Nanomaterial deposited on the tool and also makes optimum rake face utilization.

40|$|Abstract: The {{mechanism}} for structural damage during incipient slip on joints within the Melechov Granite, Czech Republic, changes with the misalignment of the joint's mesotopography, largely aplumose surface morphology. Prior to slip, the joint surfaces are well mated so that contact area is organized on a microscopic s ale. During {{the first phase}} of slip, diffusion-mass transfer isthe active deformation mechanism between the sliding surfaces of the joints, as indicated by the exten-sive growth of crystal-fibre lineations characteristic of slickenside surfaces. After slip of the order of 1 cm or more, the mesotopography becomes mismatched and the contact area is reorganized to form indentation pits aligned on the ridges of hackle plumes. Indentation pits, that are testimony to a brittle process, are generated by the excavation ofHertzian ring cracks that propagate under contact loading of a brittle substrate. The depth of the indentation pits increases with contact width, sug-gesting that indentation creep is active. Following indentation along Hertzian ring cracks the slip mechanism transforms to a frictional abrasion. The distribution of indentation track lengths is con-sistent with laboratory <b>wear</b> <b>grooves</b> generated during earthquake-like stick-slip sliding. The ellip-tical shape of the indentation pits indicates a gradual decrease in contact area, a process that is consistent with a slip-weakening mechanism during a stick-slip cycle...|$|R
