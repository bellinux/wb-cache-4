5|$|An {{early success}} {{story in the}} 1950s was the saving of the nene (or Hawaiian goose) from extinction. Birds <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> site and {{breeding}} at Slimbridge was successful. Initial releases into the wild in Hawaii were a failure however, because the nene's natural habitat was not protected from the predators that had been introduced to the islands by man. Once that problem was alleviated, successful reintroduction became possible.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the great}} spotted kiwi {{was known to}} science, several stories {{circulated}} {{about the existence of}} a large kiwi called the Maori roaroa. In 1871, two specimens <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Canterbury Museum, where they were identified as a new species and were named after the museum's curator, Dr. Haast.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century the granite rocks of the Mont Blanc massif were an {{important}} source of stone for constructing buildings; one hundred Italian stonemasons <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chamonix valley by Charles Albert of Sardinia for reconstructing the towns of Sallanches and Cluses, both of which had at that time just been destroyed by fires.|$|E

5|$|During the negotiations, the {{relatives}} {{of several of the}} West Side Boys <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gang's camp to ask them to release the British soldiers. The gang responded that they had nothing against the soldiers, but that holding them had brought attention to their demands—which now included immunity from prosecution, safe passage to the UK to take up university courses, and guaranteed acceptance to the re-formed Sierra Leone Army.|$|E
5|$|In 1250, {{relics of}} St. James <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church and its {{dedication}} was changed. It was usually known in contemporary documents as S.

5|$|Radiocarbon dating of {{the human}} remains {{suggested}} that some <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> site between either 3980–3800 calibrated BCE (95% probability) or 3960–3880 cal BCE (68% probability). It further suggested that after an interval of either 60–350 years (95% probability) or 140–290 years (68% probability), additional depositions of human remains were made inside the tomb. This second phase probably began in 3730–3540 cal BCE (95% probability) or 3670–3560 cal BCE (68% probability).|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} a {{distinct}} royal jewel collection is vague, {{though it is}} believed the jewels have their origin somewhere in the 16thcentury. Many of the pieces are from overseas and <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom {{as a result of}} civil war, coups and revolutions, or acquired as gifts to the monarch. Most of the jewellery dates from the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E

5|$|Agreements between Norwegian and Russian {{authorities}} {{were made on}} 31 August, where Norway resumed full responsibility for the recovery and investigation, but Russian help was accepted. To allow the Russian workers access from the morning of 1 September, the crew was allowed to fly in and establish a base camp, but no work was to be done until Norwegian supervisors arrived in the morning. However, two people were observed at the wreck at about 20:00 CEST, who <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Governor's offices for questioning. As they were both members of the Russian team, {{it was decided that}} the base would be disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Charles II was crowned at Scone Palace on 1 January 1651, {{at which}} the Honours of Scotland (the regalia of crown, sword and sceptre) were used. However, with Cromwell's troops in Lothian, the honours could not be {{returned}} to Edinburgh. The Earl Marischal, as Marischal of Scotland, had formal responsibility for the honours, and in June the Privy Council duly decided to place them at Dunnottar. They <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> castle by Katherine Drummond, hidden in sacks of wool. Sir George Ogilvie (or Ogilvy) of Barras was appointed lieutenant-governor of the castle, and given responsibility for its defence.|$|E

5|$|Duc had {{years of}} {{experience}} in France, which had given him a good feel of how the French might be thinking and what their relations with Francophile members of the ARVN might resemble. He used this to concoct some plausible sounding and incriminating documents for Mậu. They purported to show that three prominent members of the junta: Generals Minh, Kim and Don had been bought by French agents and were on the brink of declaring South Vietnam's neutrality and signing a peace deal to end the war with the North. Some of the documents were leaked to elements of the American presence in Saigon and <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of some senior American officials.|$|E
5|$|Edington's {{parents were}} Roger and Amice of Edington near Westbury, Wiltshire. Though {{it has been}} claimed that he was educated at Oxford, {{there seems to be}} no support for this. His first patron, however, was the Oxford {{chancellor}} Gilbert Middleton, who was also a royal counsellor. When Middleton died in 1331, Edington entered the service of Middleton's friend, Adam Orleton, Bishop of Winchester. Through Orleton, Edington's abilities <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of King Edward III, and in 1341 the King named him keeper of the wardrobe. The position was an important one; the wardrobe functioned as the treasury while the King was on campaign, and Edward strongly resisted any attempts to limit this royal prerogative.|$|E
5|$|Folk {{music in}} the US is varied across the country's {{numerous}} ethnic groups. The Native American tribes each play their own varieties of folk music, most of it spiritual in nature. African American music includes blues and gospel, descendants of West African music brought to the Americas by slaves and mixed with Western European music. During the colonial era, English, French and Spanish styles and instruments <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Americas. By the early 20th century, the United States had become a major center for folk music from around the world, including polka, Ukrainian and Polish fiddling, Ashkenazi, klezmer, and several kinds of Latin music.|$|E

5|$|In 1933 {{the first}} Welsh Corgis <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States by American breeder Mrs Lewis Roesler, for her Merriedip Kennels in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts. She had {{previously}} been well known for breeding Old English Sheepdogs. Roesler purchased a Pembroke bitch, Little Madam, at London's Paddington Station for £12. Wanting a mate for the dog, she visited several Corgi kennels and bought a dog called Captain William Lewis. The American Kennel Club (AKC) first registered Welsh Corgis in 1934, as a single breed, and Little Madam was the first registered animal of the breed. The first litter was registered later that year, by Mr E.M. Tidd in Oakland, California, from a bitch named Toots which he had purchased in Canada.|$|E
5|$|The British cavalry {{became aware}} of the ponies in 1804, during the Peninsular War, and used them as pack animals during the conflict; most did not return to Ireland. The famine of 1845–1852 furthered their decline, as farmers who {{previously}} utilised them died or emigrated. In addition, Spanish donkeys <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island to replace the ponies, and when peat declined as a fuel source, pack animals were no longer needed. In the 1850s, farms began to be consolidated, and more machinery and large draft horses were employed, further reducing the number of ponies needed. Consequently, the ponies were left to run feral, mostly ignored and sometimes shot at by locals.|$|E
5|$|The bodies <b>were</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{local high}} school {{gymnasium}} to await autopsy and identification by an FBI fingerprinting team. The Brunswick County coroner ordered autopsies of the passengers and crew to determine the specific {{cause of death for}} each. One of the victims was Vice Admiral Edward Orrick McDonnell, U.S. Navy (retired), a recipient of the Medal of Honor and a veteran of both World Wars. Other victims included {{a vice president of the}} Continental Bank of Cuba, a pharmacist, a student at the University of Miami, and an insurance adjuster. Three of the victims had been standby passengers and only made the flight due to others cancelling their reservations.|$|E
