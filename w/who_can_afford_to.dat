25|$|In general, {{men have}} most of the {{decision-making}} power in Ghanaian society. In labor and delivery, husbands and heads of the households also make most of the decisions {{in collaboration with the}} birth attendant, and sometimes a soothsayer. During labor, the husband will usually make the decision about where to deliver because a woman in labor is considered unable to think clearly due to the pain, although the head of the household will have the final say. In some cases, women, especially those <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> go to a hospital, will make their own decision about where to give birth without waiting for the approval of their husband or household heads.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} quotas was largely {{reported}} to have resulted {{in an increase in}} the percentage of Bumiputra entering public universities. The perceived bias towards Bumiputras has meant that non-Bumiputra <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> do so choose to enter private colleges or to go overseas to further their education. There is a significant proportion of non-Bumiputra who do not enter into contention for admission to public universities. It is also alleged that during the marking of examination scripts in the Government exams, that Malay/Bumiputra students are given additional points even before the students sit for the exams. As a result, despite the removal of the Quota system, this alleged unfair advantage gives more places to undeserving students of Malay origin.|$|E

25|$|In Argentina {{there are}} {{public and private}} medical schools, however the {{prestige}} of the public institutions is undeniable and the private institutions do not normally appear in international rankings. A person <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> attend a private university, quite expensive for the average Argentinian, will choose that option over public education because of the smaller groups of students in each class and {{because of the lack of}} strictness in course evaluation. By law entrance into public institutions is open and tuition-free to all who have a high school diploma, and universities are expressly forbidden from restricting access with difficult entrance exams. Point in case, in 2016 La Universidad Nacional de la Plata was obligated by the governing bodies to stop forcing its students to write an entrance exam. As a result, that university experienced a major increase in the size of its student population. When it comes to educational quality, la Universidad de Buenos Aires, a public university, is widely recognised as the top medical school in the country.|$|E
25|$|Organ {{donation}} is {{fast becoming}} an important bioethical issue from a social perspective as well. While most first-world nations have a legal system of oversight for organ transplantation, {{the fact remains that}} demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a black market trend often referred to as transplant tourism. The issues are weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> buy organs are exploiting those who are desperate enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor. On the other hand, are those who contend that the desperate should be allowed to sell their organs and that preventing them from doing so is merely contributing to their status as impoverished. Further, those in favor of the trade hold that exploitation is morally preferable to death, and in so far as the choice lies between abstract notions of justice {{on the one hand and}} a dying person whose life could be saved on the other hand, the organ trade should be legalized. Conversely, surveys conducted among living donors postoperatively and in a period of five years following the procedure have shown extreme regret in a majority of the donors, who said that given the chance to repeat the procedure, they would not. Additionally, many study participants reported a decided worsening of economic condition following the procedure. These studies looked only at people who sold a kidney in countries where organ sales are already legal.|$|E

2500|$|A pillar which {{translates}} from Arabic as “pilgrimage," [...] meaning the pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

Many Ismaili sects do not ascribe to mainstream Islamic beliefs regarding the Hajj, considering it instead to metaphorically mean visiting the Imam himself, that being the greatest and most spiritual of all pilgrimages. However, since the Druze do not follow shariah, they do not believe in a literal pilgrimage to the Kaaba in Mecca as other Muslims do, while the Mustaali (Bohras) as well as the Nizaris still hold on to the literal meaning as well, performing hajj to the Ka'aba and also visiting the Imam (or in a secluded time like today, the Dai, who is the representative or vicegerent of the Imam) to be Hajj-e Haqiqi.|$|E
