25|$|Gray's {{defenders}} {{would later}} argue that Gray simply practiced a management style {{that was different}} from that of Hoover. Gray's program of field office visits was something that Hoover had not done since his early years as director, and some felt Gray's visits did much to raise the morale of the agents working in those field offices. Furthermore, Gray's leadership style seemed to mirror what he had learned in the US Navy, in which the executive officer concentrates on the basic operation of the ship, while the captain concentrates on its position and heading. Felt believed Gray's methods were an unnecessary distraction and showed a lack of leadership. He <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> {{was not the only one}} of the FBI leaders who disapproved of Gray's methods, particularly among those who had served under Hoover.|$|E
25|$|Given {{his very}} weak heart, Poirot conceives {{that he must}} end the string of murders by killing Norton. Poirot invites Norton for hot chocolate: at their meeting, he tells Norton what he {{suspects}} and his plan to execute him. Norton, arrogant and self-assured, insists on swapping cups: anticipating this move, Poirot had drugged both cups, knowing {{that he had a}} higher tolerance for a dose that would incapacitate Norton. Poirot moves the sleeping Norton back to his room using the wheelchair: Poirot could walk, one reason he needed a new valet who was unaware of that for this last case. Then, being the same height as Norton, he disguises himself as Norton by removing his wig and false moustache, ruffling up his grey hair, then donning Norton's dressing-gown and walking with a limp. Having Hastings establish that Norton was alive after he left Poirot's room, Poirot shoots Norton, leaves the pistol on the table and locks the room with a duplicate key. Poirot then writes his story, and ceases to take his amyl nitrite heart medicine. He cannot say it was right to commit murder, but on balance he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> prevented yet more instigated by Norton. His last wish for Hastings is typical for Poirot, the matchmaker: he suggests that Hastings should pursue Elizabeth Cole.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his success}} with Cooper, Brabham <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> could do better. He {{considered}} buying Cooper {{in partnership with}} Roy Salvadori and then in late 1959 he asked his friend Ron Tauranac {{to come to the}} UK and work with him, producing upgrade kits for Sunbeam Rapier and Triumph Herald road cars at his car dealership, Jack Brabham Motors, but with the long-term aim of designing racing cars. Brabham continued to drive for Cooper, but on the long flight back from the 1960 season-opening Argentine Grand Prix, he had a heart-to-heart with John Cooper. John's father Charlie and the designer Owen Maddock had been reluctant to update their car, but although a Cooper had won in Argentina, other cars had been faster before they broke down. Brabham helped design the more advanced Cooper T53, including advice from Tauranac. Brabham spun the new car out of the next championship race, the Monaco Grand Prix, but then embarked on a series of five straight victories. He won from the front at the Dutch, French, and Belgian Grands Prix, where title rival Moss was badly injured in a practice accident that put him out for two months. Two other drivers were killed during the race. At the British Grand Prix, Brabham was closing on Graham Hill's BRM before Hill spun off, leaving Brabham the victory. He then came back from eighth place to second at the Portuguese Grand Prix after sliding off on tramlines and won after race leader John Surtees crashed. Brabham's points total was put out of reach when the British teams withdrew from the Italian GP on safety grounds. Mike Lawrence writes that Brabham's expertise in setting up the cars was a significant factor in Cooper's 1960 drivers' and constructors' titles.|$|E

To augment his salary of $400 (today $) a year from Beth Jacob, Rosenberg also worked as an agent for a cigar company. While visiting a customer at a bar, he was alleged to have eaten the pork while partaking {{of some of the}} free lunch provided there. Rosenberg initially said that while he had drunk a great deal, he had not eaten anything at all, and subsequently stated that he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> had not eaten pork, because the bar-keep had sworn in affidavit that there was none in the lunch provided that day.

500|$|With no {{knowledge}} of the fashion industry, Morgan decided to make a film on the topic after being shocked by the news of the collapse of Rana Plaza. After spending several days getting information, and discovering the industry's human rights violations and [...] "staggering environmental impacts", he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> had to make the film. He had also previously had an appreciation for the genre, saying he was [...] "actually fascinated by those [...] films that follow one person". Like Morgan a non-connoisseur of fashion, executive producer and eco activist Lucy Siegle said that she does not like such films as they are usually limited to exploring the aesthetic aspects of the industry. It is The True Cost differential in her opinion; it [...] "goes there and then someit unravels the grim, gritty, global supply chain of fast fashion". Nevertheless, the film purposely does not give viewers a clear answer on how to solve the problems as there are [...] "no straightforward answers". Morgan commented, [...] "I'm probably most proud that we avoided easy answers and instead chose to trust people to both feel and think deeply about the issues raised." ...|$|E

500|$|That same year, he {{fell out}} of a tree and broke his right hand. The injury forced him to play left-handed until his hand healed, making him {{effectively}} ambidextrous. In retrospect, he described this accident as [...] "a fortunate event" [...] and cited it {{as a factor in}} making him more versatile on the court. During a Press League game, the high school basketball coach saw him play. He was impressed by the budding star's two-handed ability and invited Cousy to come to practice the following day to try out for the junior varsity team. He did well enough to become a permanent member of the JV squad. He continued to practice day and night, and by his junior year <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> was going to be promoted to the varsity; but failing his citizenship course made him ineligible for the first semester. He joined the varsity squad midway through the season, however, scoring 28 points in his first game. He had no intention of attending college, but after he started {{to make a name for}} himself on the basketball court he started to focus on improving in both academics and basketball skills to make it easier for him to get into college.|$|E
500|$|At {{the meeting}} of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine for all she had done. He called her not only the mother of the king but the mother of the state. Henry did not tell Catherine of his plan for a {{solution}} to his problems. On 23 December 1588, he asked the Duke of Guise to call on him at the Ch√¢teau de Blois. As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died {{at the foot of the}} king's bed. At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons. Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, [...] "Please forgive me. Monsieur de Guise is dead. He will not be spoken of again. I have had him killed. I have done to him what he was going to do to me." [...] Catherine's immediate reaction is not known; but on Christmas Day, she told a friar, [...] "Oh, wretched man! What has he done?... Pray for him... I see him rushing towards his ruin." [...] She visited her old friend Cardinal de Bourbon on 1 January 1589 to tell him she <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> would soon be freed.

It was his 21st ranking final and 16th ranking title, which meant he was now third on the list ahead of Williams and Higgins. The victory earned him ¬£60,000 and meant he had won all the ranking events on the calendar at least once. After the match O'Sullivan said he could still improve: [...] "I have set myself high standards and I don't think I was firing on any cylinders."

2500|$|His first {{sport was}} {{football}} {{and he got}} as far as playing for his [...] or area. Friends encouraged him into cycling and he rode his first official race in 1976, which he won. Fignon's parents did not want him to race, and he raced without them knowing. He won four more races in his first year, but only one in his second year. In this third year, he won 18 out of 36 races. Fignon's parents allowed him to race, but still thought that he should study. Fignon entered the University of Villetaneuse, studying Structural and Materials Science. Fignon was not interested in his studies, and was an indifferent student. [...] His chief desire was to pursue cycling. He told his parents that he was leaving the university and would join the army {{at the end of the}} year to do his military service.

2500|$|In early March 1943 the {{provision}} of electric power for the lighting in the internees' compounds was halted. This was a serious blow as the radio was run off the power supply. Batteries were unavailable and so the only solution, again the idea of Russell, was to construct a generator. His idea again met with some initial scepticism: [...] "Now I know he has gone mad", wrote Pringle. Pringle‚Äôs colleagues were more enthusiastic. Beckett <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> could build the generator and British RAOC personnel were certain they could supply the necessary components, though {{they thought it would}} take three months to make the tools needed. To disguise the noise of the work the enterprise was described as a [...] "watch repairing factory" [...] to the Japanese, who offered the use of various tools and other equipment. In March 1943, after the execution of some prisoners at the Sandakan POW camp for operating a radio, the Japanese stepped up their searches at Batu Lintang. Many items essential for the construction of the generator such as magnets, wire, and scrap iron were not easily available, but the involvement of [...] "Freddie", one of the prisoners who was a self-confessed thief (and most likely the same man who sorted the power supply: records are unclear) meant that material and equipment was soon obtained.|$|E
2500|$|The writing effort changed {{direction}} when Franklin {{fell ill}} and {{was removed from}} the production. Zimbalist offered the project to William Wyler, who had been one of 30 assistant directors on the 1925 film, in early 1957. Wyler initially rejected it, considering the quality of the script [...] to be [...] "very primitive, elementary" [...] and no better than hack work. It lacked good characterization, the dramatic structure was poor, and the leads were uninteresting (just [...] "villains and heroes"). Zimbalist showed Wyler some preliminary storyboards for the chariot race, and Wyler began to express an interest in the picture. Zimbalist told Wyler, [...] "Forget the chariot race. That's just second-unit stuff", stating that the real challenge would be to give the picture [...] "body, depth, intimacy", which Wyler was renowned for. Zimbalist also told Wyler that MGM would spend up to $10 million on the film, and Wyler, impressed with the large budget, agreed to review the script a second time. The more Wyler thought about the story, the more he became intrigued with its possibilities. However, {{according to a report in}} The New York Times, Wyler refused to take the job until he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> had a good leading man. MGM permitted Wyler to start casting, and in April 1957, mainstream media outlets reported that Wyler was giving screen tests to Italian leading men, such as Cesare Danova.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, reactor-plant {{operating}} procedures precluded a rapid reactor restart following a scram, {{or even the}} ability to use steam remaining in the secondary system to [...] "drive" [...] the submarine to the surface. After a scram, standard procedure was to isolate the main steam system, cutting off the flow of steam to the turbines providing propulsion and electricity. This was done to prevent an over-rapid cool-down of the reactor. Threshers Reactor Control Officer, Lieutenant Raymond McCoole, was not at his station in the maneuvering room, or indeed on the boat, during the fatal dive. McCoole was at home caring for his wife who had been injured in a household accident‚Äîhe had been all but ordered ashore by a sympathetic Commander Harvey. McCoole's trainee, Jim Henry, fresh from nuclear power school, probably followed standard {{operating procedures}} and gave the order to isolate the steam system after the scram, even though Thresher was at or slightly below its maximum depth. Once closed, the large steam system isolation valves could not be reopened quickly. Reflecting on the situation in later life, McCoole <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> would have delayed shutting the valves, thus allowing the boat to [...] "answer bells" [...] and drive itself to the surface, despite the flooding in the engineering spaces. Admiral Rickover later changed the procedure, creating the [...] "Fast Recovery Startup" [...] procedure. The Fast Recovery Startup allows an immediate reactor restart and for steam to be withdrawn from the secondary system in limited quantities for several minutes following a scram.|$|E
