5|$|The game {{is divided}} into eight caverns, which must be {{explored}} whilst avoiding death from enemy attacks, cave-ins, and fatal falls. The player-character, Digger T.

Monsters such as moles, mosquitoes, and dragons seek to kill the player-character. Digger's only defence is his shovel, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to attack enemies as well as mining stone. The player starts the game with three lives.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Trader is a turn-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} played from a two-dimensional perspective. The player controls a ship and seeks out three artifacts {{to defeat the}} game's final boss, a sea creature called the Ancient Guardian. The player explores the map to gather items, including tea, spices, and fruit, {{all of which can}} be found in wrecks. These can be exchanged for gold, <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> to buy upgrades for the ship. The commodities are stored in the cargo hold, the capacity of which can be upgraded with gold.|$|E

To transport passengers to shore the tenders pull up to one of four loading stations, each of which has a large hull door that hydraulically opens outwards to form a boarding platform, complete with railings and decking.|$|E
