A major aim of welfare reform was to ensure that low earners would always be better off in employment. [...] "After years of piecemeal reform the current welfare system is complex and unfair," [...] said Duncan Smith, citing examples of people under the existing system that would see very little incremental income from increasing their working hours due to withdrawal of other benefits. Outlining the scheme in more detail in November 2010, Duncan Smith promised [...] "targeted <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> for those who need {{to get used to the}} habits of work" [...] and sanctions, including the possible removal of benefits for up to three years for those who refused to work. He said welfare reform would benefit all those who [...] "play by the rules" [...] and ensure [...] "work always pays more" [...] by easing the rate at which benefits are withdrawn as income rises.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{evaluate}} a method for measuring <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> and skill requirements of 160 occupations in eight countries, used in EurOccupations, an EU-FP 6 project. Additionally, it aims to explore how the internet can be used for measuring <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> and skill requirements. Design/methodology/approach - For the 160 occupations, <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> were described in approximately ten tasks. Occupational experts and jobholders were invited to rate these tasks and to indicate the skill requirements, using a multilingual web-survey. Experts were recruited through the networks of the project partners and jobholders through frequently visited websites in the eight countries. The effectiveness of the drafting of tasks descriptions, the recruitment of raters, and the measurement of skill requirements is evaluated. Findings - The project showed that tasks descriptions for a wide range of occupations and countries can be drafted relatively easy, using desk research. Conducting a web-survey with a routing for 160 occupations and eight countries is viable. Recruiting experts used more resources than recruiting jobholders using the internet. Measuring skill requirements would need much more resources due to major variations within and across countries. Research limitations/implications - The article addresses a number of areas that are potentially worthy of further empirical investigations for a Europe-wide library of occupational titles, <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> and skill requirements. Practical implications - The paper outlines the potential of a future method for a European library of <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> and skill requirements for occupational titles, thereby facilitating European industrial training efforts. Social implications - Insight in the <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> and skill requirements of occupations will facilitate labour mobility and related training across EU member states. Originality/value - This paper explores the potential for a Europe-wide empirical underpinning of <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> and skill requirements, using a web-survey and the internet...|$|R

5000|$|Action {{regulation}} theory (or Activity regulation theory) was jointly {{developed by}} Winfried Hacker. in the 1980s. The Theory {{serves as a}} basis for modelling working conditions. As a process model it {{has its roots in the}} Soviet psychological activity theory [...] on the one side and on the other side it is based on the T.O.T.E. Model (Test-Operation-Test-Exit) from Miller, Galanter and Pribram.The pursued approach of the Action-Regulation-Theory is the integration of cognitive, behaviourism and social science orientated conceptions. This integration then is used to make explanatory and modelling statements about work conditions. Hacker talks in this context about the holistic <b>work</b> <b>activity,</b> which is an essential criteria for personality development. Through the above described should the partialization of <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> and the Taylorism be overcome. As a cybernetic approach the ground idea of an action/ activity is the regulation.Between the visible <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> and the non visible cognitive processes is a gap, which the Action-Regulation-Theory promise to close. Through a hierarchical-sequential structured model, action steps are supposed to be accurately captured and analysed.|$|E

Students’ perspectives with regards to their involvement in oral group activities were identified. Besides, the potential implications of group <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> on the students’ individual performance in speaking assessment were also determined. To achieve these objectives, 33 Form 2 students of SMK Damai Jaya were involved. The data were obtained through the analysis of students’ questionnaire, interviews with three language teachers as well as the observations in class during group <b>work</b> <b>activities.</b> The findings show students’ positive attitude towards group <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> in class. This contributes to a significant increase in students’ participation in their groups. The general results obtained also indicate some improvements in students’ speaking when they are assessed individually. Hence, group <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> could have significant pedagogical implications and could be a practical technique if they are carefully planned to teach speaking skills among the students...|$|R

Unless we have {{a clear understanding of}} what factors of <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> and styles depend on what factors of {{work environment}}s and vice versa, we {{would not be able to}} modify or add components of work environments “effectively. ” This paper first presents our framework to measure work factors of <b>work</b> <b>activities,</b> styles and an environment, and then discusses results of our case study of applying the framework to actual work practice at NTT Data Corporation. Our framework consists of three representational models: the KPM (Knowledge Production Model) for representing <b>work</b> <b>activities,</b> the MS-GI (Mobile-Settled, Group-Individual) model for characterizing work styles, and the SOU (System-Office-Usage) model for representing a work environment. We have conducted a survey on 274 workers at an organizational unit of NTT Data Corporation by applying the three models. The result shows that the framework is successfully applied to understand the relationships among the three work factors at least partially if not completely. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the framework can be used to evolve work environments by taking into account <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> and styles.

The aim {{of the study was to}} identify the current clinical <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> performed by occupational therapists and social workers and whether there was a discrepancy between the actual and preferred <b>work</b> <b>activities.</b> The study also aimed to identify whether any discrepancy between their actual and preferred clinical <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> was associated with higher levels of stress. A cross-sectional survey of 304 (response rate 76. 6 %) occupational therapists and social workers in Australian mental health services was conducted. A <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> scale developed specifically for this study and the Mental Health Professionals Stress Scale were used to measure actual and preferred <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> and stress respectively. Both groups experienced a discrepancy between their actual and preferred <b>work</b> <b>activities,</b> with the occupational therapists and the social workers mostly wanting to undertake a diverse range of activities to a significantly greater extent than they currently were. As predicted, stress was associated with the discrepancy between the kind of work that the participants wanted to do and the kind of work that their job actually entailed. Health workers require assistance to adapt to their new work roles and to achieve a balance between generic and discipline-specific competencies. This has implications for education and professional training...|$|R
