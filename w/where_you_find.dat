25|$|Goals {{are related}} in a {{hierarchical}} format <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> some goals {{are dependent on}} other sub goals {{for them to be}} complete which means all the sub goals must be achieved for the main goal to be achieved. There is other goals where only one of the goals need to be fulfilled for the main goal to be achieved. In goal modelling, there is use of deontic operator which falls in between the context and achieved state. Goals apply to tasks, milestones, resource roles and resources as well and can be considered as action rule for at task. EEML rules were also possible to although the goal modelling requires much more consultation in finding the connections between rules on the different levels. Goal-oriented analysis focuses on the description and evaluation of alternatives and their relationship to the organisational objectives.|$|E
25|$|From the carpark {{at the end}} of Glenesk Road, {{directions}} {{are clearly}} signposted. A well formed loop track, used by around 30,000 people a year (2005), follows the Glen Esk Stream with minor undulations (on the south side) up to a lookout <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> a huge Macrocarpa bench seat to rest on and admire the view. The bench seat was made by offenders doing community work (2005). The track then descends down wooden steps {{to the base of the}} falls (40 minutes from the carpark). The track then crosses the stream next to the lower swimming hole and returns down the north side. However, instead of going down again, a walker can climb a reasonably steep track (the Connect Track) which begins about 100m from the base of the falls on the northern side of the stream. It takes about 15 minutes to get to the top of the falls. There is a good swimming hole at the top although the water is cool. From this high vantage point there are great views down the valley.|$|E

500|$|That same year, deHavilland {{made two}} more period films, {{beginning}} with The Great Garrick, a fictional romantic comedy about the 18th-century English actor's encounter with jealous {{players from the}} Comédie-Française who plot to embarrass {{him on his way}} to Paris. Wise to their prank, Garrick plays along with the ruse, determined to get the last laugh, even on a lovely young aristocrat, deHavilland's Germaine Dupont, whom he mistakenly believes {{to be one of the}} players. With her refined demeanor and diction, deHavilland delivers a performance that is [...] "lighthearted and thoroughly believable", according to Judith Kass. Variety praised the film, calling it [...] "a production of superlative workmanship". Despite the positive reviews, the film did not do as well at the box office. Her final film that year was Michael Curtiz's romantic drama Gold Is <b>Where</b> <b>You</b> <b>Find</b> It, a film about the late 19th-century conflict in the Sacramento Valley between gold miners and their hydraulic equipment and farmers whose land is being flooded. DeHavilland played the daughter of a farmer, Serena Ferris, who falls in love with the mining engineer responsible for the flooding. The film was released in February 1938, and was her first appearance in three-strip Technicolor.|$|E
