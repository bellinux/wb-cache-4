5|$|For some people, aspirin {{does not}} have as strong an effect on {{platelets}} as for others, an effect known as aspirin-resistance or insensitivity. One study has suggested <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be resistant than men, and a different, aggregate study of 2,930 people found 28% were resistant.|$|E
5|$|<b>Women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> develop {{hypothyroidism}} than men. In population-based studies, {{women were}} seven {{times more likely}} than men to have TSH levels above 10 mU/l. 2–4% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical hypothyroidism is more common in the elderly, and in Caucasians. There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, the most common of which is hypothyroidism, in individuals with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E

5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion that <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also {{the notion that the}} net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E

50|$|A {{gender gap}} had existed in Europe before the 1990s where <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to support {{conservative}} political parties. During the 1990s this gender gap had disappeared. It still exists in Eastern European countries.|$|R
25|$|The German Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency stated {{on their}} website that the {{establishment}} of women's parking spaces does not violate the General Equal Treatment Act (Allgemeines Gleichbehandlungsgesetz), because <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than men to be victims of sexual abuse.|$|R
50|$|In May 2007, {{researchers}} with the Centers for Disease Control reported on rates of self-reported violence among intimate partners {{using data from}} a 2001 study. In the study, almost one-quarter of participants reported some violence in their relationships. Half of these involved one-sided ("non-reciprocal") attacks and half involved both assaults and counter assaults ("reciprocal violence"). Women reported committing one-sided attacks {{more than twice as}} often as men (70% versus 29%). In all cases of intimate partner violence, <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> injured than men, but 25% of men in relationships with two-sided violence reported injury compared to 20% of women reporting injury in relationships with one-sided violence. <b>Women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> injured in non-reciprocal violence.|$|R
25|$|In modern times, <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> blame themselves, perhaps {{deciding}} that their diet, childbearing history, {{decision not to}} breastfeed, or level of exercise is the cause.|$|E
25|$|About 70 {{percent of}} ECT {{patients}} are women. This {{may be due}} to the fact that <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be diagnosed with depression.

25|$|Several {{studies have}} found that black women in the U.S. are more likely to die from breast cancer even though white <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be {{diagnosed}} with the disease. Even after diagnosis, black women are less likely to get treatment compared to white women. Scholars have advanced several theories for the disparities, including inadequate access to screening, reduced availability of the most advanced surgical and medical techniques, or some biological characteristic of the disease in the African American population. Some studies suggest that the racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes may reflect cultural biases more than biological disease differences. However, the lack of diversity in clinical trials for breast cancer treatment may contribute to these disparities, with recent research indicating that black <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have estrogen receptor negative breast cancers, which are not responsive to hormone treatments that are effective for most white women. Research is currently ongoing to define the contribution of both biological and cultural factors.|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examines}} {{gender differences in}} victim and crime characteristics {{in an effort to}} determine the extent towhich sexual assault is a similar experience formen and forwomen. Data from a routine structured interview was obtained from medical charts of 842 women and 128 men seen at an urban hospital-based rape treatment center. Demographic characteristics were similar, although males <b>were</b> <b>more</b> like to identify as gay or bisexual, and <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> of minority ethnicity. Men <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to report acute psychiatric symptoms, a history of psychiatric disorder, and a history of psychiatric hospitalization. <b>Women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to experience vaginal or anal penetration, to sustain injuries, and to make a police report.

50|$|<b>Women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have: (a) a {{publicly}} viewable Facebook account, (b) more photo albums, (c) more photos, (d) {{a photo of}} themselves as their profile picture, (e) positive references to alcohol, partying, or drugs, and (f) more positive references to or about the institution or institution-related activities. In general, <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to disclose information about themselves in their Facebook profile, with the primary exception of sharing their telephone number. Similarly, female respondents to Strano's study <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to keep their profile photo recent and choose a photo that made them appear attractive, happy, and fun-loving. Citing several examples, Strano opined that {{there may also be}} a difference in how men and women Facebook users display and interpret profile photos depicting relationships.|$|R
5000|$|In a UK study, 37% {{of junior}} doctors {{reported}} being bullied {{in the previous}} year and 84% had experienced at least one bullying behaviour.

25|$|Obesity {{has been}} linked to an {{increased}} risk of developing breast cancer by many scientific studies. There is evidence to suggest that excess body fat at the time of breast cancer diagnosis is associated with higher rates of cancer recurrence and death. Furthermore, studies have shown that obese <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have large tumors, greater lymph node involvement, and poorer breast cancer prognosis with 30% higher risk of mortality.|$|E
25|$|While doing {{research}} on sexual tendencies {{of women who have}} sex with women, one study, from the Journal of Bisexuality, concluded that bisexual <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> engage in various high risk behaviors and were at a higher risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. These behaviors have been attributed to the unlikeliness of bisexuals to discuss their sexuality and proper protection with health professionals for fear of judgement or discrimination, leaving them uneducated.|$|E
25|$|PTSD is {{believed}} to be caused by the experience {{of a wide range of}} traumatic events and, in particular if the trauma is extreme, can occur in persons with no predisposing conditions.

40|$|This {{research}} had two aims. Firstly, to examine availability of emotional support in chat rooms, and secondly, to investigate openness and dishonesty in chat rooms. Three {{hundred and twenty}} respondents (160 women and 160 men) filled out the ‘Chat Room Survey’. It was {{found that people who}} spend more time in chat rooms <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> open about themselves, receive emotional support, and give emotional support. <b>Women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than men to give emotional support.

5000|$|Problems {{resulting}} from mass incarceration extend beyond {{economic and political}} aspects to reach community lives as well. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, 46% of black female inmates were likely to {{have grown up in}} a home with only their mothers. A study by Bresler and Lewis shows how incarcerated African American <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have <b>been</b> raised in a single female headed household while incarcerated white <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> raised in a two parent household.

25|$|In the US, the {{incidence}} rate in women over 50 is approximately 33 per 100,000. The rate {{of ovarian cancer}} between 1993 and 2008 decreased in women of the 40–49 age cohort and in the 50–64 age cohort. Ovarian cancer is most commonly diagnosed after menopause, {{between the ages of}} 60 and 64. Ninety percent of ovarian cancer occurs in women over the age of 45 and 80% in women over 50.

25|$|Cultural factors, such as {{discrimination}} {{of various}} kinds, can negatively affect productivity {{such as age}} discrimination, stereotyping, discrimination against people with physical disability, gender discrimination, racial discrimination, and caste discrimination. Women are the group suffering from {{the highest rate of}} poverty after children; 14.5% of women and 22% of children are poor in the United States. In addition, the fact that <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be caregivers, regardless of income level, to either the generations before or after them, exacerbates the burdens of their poverty.|$|E

25|$|Critics of {{this model}} argue that it ignores {{research}} linking domestic violence to substance abuse and psychological problems. Some modern research into the patterns in DV has found that <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be physically abusive towards their partner in relationships in which only one partner is violent, which draws the effectiveness of using concepts like male privilege to treat domestic violence into question. Some modern research into predictors of injury from domestic violence suggests that the strongest predictor of injury by domestic violence is participation in reciprocal domestic violence.|$|E
25|$|Research has {{indicated}} that <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be left hemisphere dominant, and {{men are more likely}} to be right hemisphere dominant. Because of this, women recover faster from left hemisphere damage, and men are more likely to recover faster from right hemisphere damage. Men who have suffered a right hemisphere stroke also have significantly better rehabilitation outcomes than men who suffer a left hemisphere stroke. Recovery of functional abilities is often greater in male stroke survivors than females, especially in the area of activities of daily living.|$|E

40|$|Background Studies {{suggest that}} <b>women</b> may <b>be</b> {{at greater risk}} for {{developing}} chronic pain and pain-related disability. Methods Because musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are the most frequently endorsed painful conditions among veterans, we sought to characterize gender differences in sociodemographic and clinical correlates among veterans upon entry into Veterans Health Administration's Musculoskeletal Disorders Cohort (n = 4, 128, 008). Results <b>Women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> younger, Black, unmarried, and veterans of recent conflicts. In analyses adjusted for gender differences in sociodemographics, <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have diagnoses of fibromyalgia, temporomandibular disorders, and neck pain. Almost one in five women (19. 4 %) had more than one MSD diagnosis, compared with 15. 7 % of men; this higher risk of MSD multimorbidity remained in adjusted analyses. Adjusting for sociodemographics, <b>women</b> with MSD <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have migraine headache and depressive, anxiety, and bipolar disorders.
