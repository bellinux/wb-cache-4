However, in response to increased competition and falling market share, it looked for <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> costs. In its early years Classic Hits broadcast live local programmes in every region from Monday to Saturday, taking Auckland network programmes at night and on Sundays. In 1998 it reduced local programming to four hours a day in all regions except Christchurch, and introduced new network shows for mornings and afternoons.

Sherman, [...] "...Our cuttle fish [...] of the navy {{although}} he may conceal his tracks for a while in the obscure atmosphere which surrounds him, will eventually be brought to bay...." [...] Robeson later testified in front of a House Naval Committee on January 16, 1879, about giving contracts to private companies. Robeson was asked about the use of old material to build ironclads and whether he had the authority to dispose of the Puritan, an outdated ironclad. Although Robeson served ably during the Virginius Affair and did authorize the construction of five new Navy ships, his financial integrity remained in question and was suspect during the Grant administration. To be fair, Congress gave Robeson limited funding to build ships and as Secretary was constantly finding <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> budgets.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 February 1967, Scorpion entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for needed {{refueling}} overhaul. However, {{instead of}} a much-needed complete overhaul, she received only emergency repairs to get quickly back on duty. The preferred SUBSAFE program required increased submarine overhaul times, from 9 months in length to 36 months. Intensive vetting of submarine component quality, SUBSAFE, was required, coupled with various improvements and intensified structural inspections– particularly, hull-welding inspections using ultrasonic testing– and reduced availability of critical parts like seawater piping. Cold War pressures prompted US Submarine Force Atlantic (SUBLANT) officers to seek <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> corners. The last overhaul cost one-seventh of those performed on other nuclear submarines at the same time. This {{was the result of}} concerns about the [...] "high percentage of time offline" [...] for nuclear attack submarines, estimated at about 40% of total available duty time.|$|E
