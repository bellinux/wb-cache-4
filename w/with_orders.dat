50|$|Clearly, a Wieferich {{prime to}} base a <b>with</b> <b>order</b> n {{is also a}} Wieferich prime to base a <b>with</b> <b>order</b> m for all 2 ≤ m ≤ n, and Wieferich prime to base a <b>with</b> <b>order</b> 2 is equivent to Wieferich prime to base a, so we can only {{consider}} the n ≥ 3 case. However, there are no known Wieferich prime to base 2 <b>with</b> <b>order</b> 3. The first base with known Wieferich prime <b>with</b> <b>order</b> 3 is 9, where 2 is a Wieferich prime to base 9 <b>with</b> <b>order</b> 3.

5|$|After the {{occupation}} of Veracruz, many military personnel received the Medal of Honor, an unusually high number that somewhat diminished {{the prestige of the}} award. The army presented one, nine went to marines and 46 were bestowed upon naval personnel. During World War I, Butler, then a major, attempted to return his medal, explaining he had done nothing to deserve it. The medal was returned <b>with</b> <b>orders</b> to keep it and to wear it as well.|$|E
5|$|All {{families}} {{had their own}} gardens in which they grew vegetables that lasted through the winter. Some raised cows, pigs and chickens; others had horses for carrying firewood. There was little refrigeration, and perishables were difficult to keep. Before the mercantile came to Elcor, residents went to the J. P. Ahlin store in McKinley, or to the Saari, Campbell and Kraker Mercantile in Gilbert. Deliveries were made daily, <b>with</b> <b>orders</b> taken for the following day. People bought on credit and paid monthly, on paydays.|$|E

5|$|County {{officials}} did not {{take care of the}} problem, so West sent Hobbs, hoping the presence of a woman would prevent any outbreak of violence. She was dispatched <b>with</b> <b>orders</b> to restore order and to implement martial law if necessary. While Hobbs was traveling to Eastern Oregon, both she and Governor West were coy with reporters about the presence of the militia, suggesting that Hobbs might be acting alone.|$|E
5|$|During 1944, {{the balance}} of naval power in the Pacific decisively turned against Japan, and by early 1945, its fleet was much {{depleted}} and badly hobbled by critical fuel shortages in the home islands. In {{a desperate attempt to}} slow the Allied advance, Yamato was dispatched on a one-way mission to Okinawa in April 1945, <b>with</b> <b>orders</b> to beach herself and fight until destroyed protecting the island. The task force was spotted south of Kyushu by US submarines and aircraft, and on 7 April 1945 she was sunk by American carrier-based bombers and torpedo bombers with the loss of most of her crew.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} clear hostility of the Russian Emperor Nicholas I, Wallachian revolutionaries sought instead a {{rapprochement}} with the Ottoman leadership. Efforts {{were made to}} clarify that the movement did not seek to reject Ottoman suzerainty: for this purpose, Ion Ghica was sent to Istanbul as early as May 29, 1848; his mission was initially successful, but later events led Sultan Abdülmecid I to reconsider his position, especially after being faced with Russian protests. Süleyman Pașa, Abdülmecid's brother-in-law, was dispatched to Bucharest <b>with</b> <b>orders</b> {{to report on the}} situation and take appropriate measures.|$|E
30|$|In addition, {{this paper}} mainly {{focuses on the}} case that the {{fractional}} order is 0 <α< 2, since there exists an equivalent relation of fractional-order systems <b>with</b> <b>order</b> 0 <α≤ 1 and <b>with</b> <b>order</b> 1 ≤β< 2; see [15].|$|R

Next, we establish a tight lower bound 1 +ω(G) －n on the minus maximum-clique transversal number of an arbitrary graph G <b>with</b> <b>order</b> n and clique number ω(G).

5|$|In 1790, Manuel Quimper of the Spanish Navy {{set sail}} from Nootka, a {{temporary}} settlement on Vancouver Island, <b>with</b> <b>orders</b> {{to explore the}} newly discovered Strait of Juan de Fuca. Accompanying Quimper was first-pilot Gonzalo Lopez de Haro, who drew detailed charts during the six-week expedition. Although Quimper's journal of the voyage does not refer to the mountain, one of Haro's manuscript charts includes a sketch of Mount Baker. The Spanish named the snowy volcano , as it reminded them of the white-clad monks of the Carmelite Monastery.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944, the Luftwaffe Operation Bodenplatte {{with the}} aim of {{crippling}} Allied tactical air forces based in the Low Countries, and thus reviving the bogged-down progress of the Wehrmacht during the Battle of the Bulge. The operation was launched on New Year's Day, 1945. JG 1 participated in this action <b>with</b> <b>orders</b> to destroy as many enemy aircraft on the ground as possible. Although a large number of allied aircraft were destroyed, the Luftwaffe lost a large number of pilots that were irreplaceable.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, Roddenberry received a telegram <b>with</b> <b>orders</b> to attend Kelly Air Force Base, enlisting on December 18, 1941. Following the completion of boot camp, {{he was sent to}} Corsicana, Texas for pilot training by civilian instructors. He completed sixty hours of flight time there, including thirty-two solo hours. In March 1942, he moved to Goodfellow Field (now Goodfellow Air Force Base) in San Angelo, Texas for basic flight training where he flew a Vultee BT-13 Valiant. Roddenberry graduated on August 5, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant.|$|E

Some new sufficient {{conditions on the}} local (globally) asymptotic stability for a class of fractional <b>order</b> nonlinear systems <b>with</b> <b>order</b> 0 <α< 2 are proposed by using properties of Mittag-Leffler function and the Gronwall inequality.

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we define {{a class of}} nested logic {{programs}}, nested logic programs <b>with</b> <b>ordered</b> disjunction (LP ODs +), which allows to specify qualitative preferences by means of nested preference expressions. For doing this we extend the syntax of logic programs <b>with</b> <b>ordered</b> disjunction (LPODs) to capture more general expressions. We define the LP ODs + semantics in a simple way and we extend most {{of the results of}} logic programs <b>with</b> <b>ordered</b> disjunction showing how our approach effectively is a proper generalisation of LPODs. ...|$|R

5|$|Making slow going amidst {{considerable}} resistance, the Australians nevertheless reached KB Mission {{late in the}} day. A {{force of}} Japanese remained there, and the Australians attacked with bayonets fixed. In the fighting that followed 60 Japanese were killed or wounded. The Australians were then able to firmly establish themselves at the mission. Meanwhile, the two companies from the 9th Battalion took up positions at Kilarbo and between the Gama River and Homo Creek <b>with</b> <b>orders</b> to establish blocking positions to allow the 2/12th to continue its advance the following morning.|$|E

At {{the time of the first}} alarm, Sydney Harbour was closed to external traffic, but Muirhead-Gould ordered ferries and other internal traffic to continue, as he believed that having multiple ships travelling around at speed would help force any submarines to remain submerged.|$|E
