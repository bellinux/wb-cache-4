5|$|A highly active predator, {{the river}} otter has adapted to hunting in water, and eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The {{vulnerability}} and seasonal availability of prey animals mainly governs its food habits and prey choices. This availability {{is influenced by}} the following factors: detectability and mobility of the prey, habitat availability for the various prey species, environmental factors, such as <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> and temperature, and seasonal changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{the water}} regime due to the {{construction}} of the Ithai barrage across the Manipur River have caused changes in the vegetation composition of the phumdis. A study was instituted, from October 2005 to July 2006, to record the vegetation composition and productivity of phumdis in areas of ranging thickness, <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> and soil pH, accumulating data in both summer and winter. The study recorded 83 plant species of 21 families (Poaceae and Cyperaceae formed the dominant families); 81 species were recorded in summer and 48 in winter.|$|E

30|$|The maximum EDEN depth {{during the}} green-up window (MAXf 2 g) divided the data {{so that the}} {{variability}} in <b>water</b> <b>depths</b> over six years starting {{in the year of}} the fire (σ) became another decision point for further partitioning (Figure 3 B). Mean DTP for fires with higher <b>water</b> <b>depths</b> during the green-up window (> 26.5 cm) was (5.0 ± 1.8) years. Mean DTP for fires with lower <b>water</b> <b>depths</b> and higher <b>water</b> variability (> 27.8 cm) was (4.7 ± 1.2) years, whereas fires with lower water variability had a mean DTP of (3.0 ± 1.0) years.|$|R

5|$|In {{ecosystems}} such as mangrove swamps, trees {{play a role}} {{in developing}} the habitat, since the roots of the mangrove trees reduce the speed of flow of tidal currents and trap water-borne sediment, reducing the <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> and creating suitable conditions for further mangrove colonisation. Thus mangrove swamps tend to extend seawards in suitable locations. Mangrove swamps also provide an effective buffer against the more damaging effects of cyclones and tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} ecological characteristic of abyssal ecosystems is energy limitation. Abyssal seafloor communities {{are considered to be}} food limited because benthic production depends on the input of detrital organic material produced in the euphotic zone, thousands of meters above. Most of the organic flux arrives as an attenuated rain of small particles (typically, only 0.5–2% of net primary production in the euphotic zone), which decreases inversely with <b>water</b> <b>depth.</b> The small particle flux can be augmented by the fall of larger carcasses and downslope transport of organic material near continental margins.|$|E
5|$|A {{fathometer}} was {{not required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked one, even though fathometers were {{available at the time}} of her sinking. Instead, a hand line was the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the <b>water</b> <b>depth.</b> The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E

5|$|Maritime trade {{along the}} coast of East Africa was {{facilitated}} by trade winds in the Indian Ocean, as well as relatively short distances between land masses. Gedi and other large, contemporary mainland sites often had poor anchorages compared to later sites {{along the coast}}, considering the exposure of their shorelines, availability of sheltered harbors, and <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> upon approach. However, despite reduced access to good anchorage, Gedi and other large mainland sites were able to maintain a high degree of economic success. Their success in trade may have been influenced by the early establishment of trade routes and available commercial support from their hinterlands.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Rona {{was back}} in Paris {{studying}} with Joliot-Curie, who had discovered artificial radioactivity. Soon after, Curie died and Rona became ill, but {{she was able to}} return to Vienna late the following year to share what had been learned with a group of researchers made up of Pettersson, Elizabeth Kara-Michailova, and Ernst Føyn, who was serving as an assistant to Ellen Gleditsch at that time. Their studies centered on research of the effect caused by bombarding radionuclides with neutrons. In 1935 Rona consolidated some of these relationships, working on Stora Bornö, then visiting Gleditsch in Oslo, then traveling to Copenhagen to see Hevesy, and later to Kålhuvudet, Sweden to meet with Karlik and Pettersson. One of the projects the group had been working on for several years was to determine if there was any correlation between <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> and radium content, and their seawater research evaluated the concentration of elements in seawater collected from different locations.|$|E
5|$|Sewage outfalls {{into the}} lake are {{proposed}} to be completely stopped by the interception and diversion of feeder lines.

Conservation measures proposed for adoption to clean the lake are by way of desilting and deweeding, water treatment at inlet of feeders into the lake, construction of check dams, conservation of ghats, afforestation of denuded hills in the catchment, soil moisture conservation measures, stabilization of sand dunes by planting vegetation of suitable species of plants and restriction of cultivation {{in the bed of}} feeder channels. In addition, the institutional measures considered for effecting improvement of the lake are mass awareness programmes with the population's participation as well as the control of fish proliferation {{to reduce the risk of}} death of fishes during periods of inadequate <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> in the lake.|$|E

5|$|The {{body of a}} teleost is denser than water, so fish must {{compensate}} for the difference or they will sink. Many teleosts have a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases {{to allow them to}} stay at the current <b>water</b> <b>depth,</b> or ascend or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. In the more primitive groups like some minnows, the swim bladder is open to the esophagus and doubles as a lung. It is often absent in fast-swimming fishes such as the tuna and mackerel. In fish where the swim bladder is closed, the gas content is controlled through the rete mirabilis, a network of blood vessels serving as a countercurrent gas exchanger between the swim bladder and the blood. The Chondrostei such as sturgeons also have a swim bladder, but this appears to have evolved separately: other Actinopterygii such as the bowfin and the bichir do not have one, so swim bladders appear to have arisen twice, and the teleost swim bladder is not homologous with the chondrostean one.|$|E
5|$|On November 19, 2008, {{the police}} {{investigation}} was completed using 13,600 pages, which took 16 months {{of research to}} be produced, during which 336 people were heard. For federal prosecutors, {{the former director of}} ANAC Denise Abreu and then flight safety officer of the company, Marco Aurelio dos Santos de Miranda, should be convicted of attempt on air transport security in willful mode. In March 2006, Denise Abreu took over the management of air services of the newly established National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC). The investigation of the accident with the Airbus TAM, which killed 199 people in Congonhas, revealed that in February 2007, the São Paulo federal judge Cecilia Marcondes, who saw action restricting the landing planes in Congonhas on rainy days, received Denise Abreu one of ANAC document like a standard, but it was only a technical study. According to the complaint, the study presented as standard guarantee, in theory, security in landing operations at Congonhas airport in São Paulo. The study indicated that takeoffs and landings were forbidden in Congonhas case the track was with a <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> greater than 3mm. After the accident with the plane of TAM in July 2007 it revealed that the study was not a standard and thus there was no obligation to follow it. According to the testimony of federal judge Cecilia Marcondes to the Federal Public Ministry, the document was fundamental to the Federal Court to release the runway for takeoffs and landings of all equipment.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{several studies}} have shown that archaea exist not only in {{mesophilic}} and thermophilic environments but are also present, sometimes in high numbers, at low temperatures as well. For example, archaea are common in cold oceanic environments such as polar seas. Even more significant are the large numbers of archaea found throughout the world's oceans in non-extreme habitats among the plankton community (as part of the picoplankton). Although these archaea can be present in extremely high numbers (up to 40% of the microbial biomass), almost none of these species have been isolated and studied in pure culture. Consequently, our understanding of the role of archaea in ocean ecology is rudimentary, so their full influence on global biogeochemical cycles remains largely unexplored. Some marine Crenarchaeota are capable of nitrification, suggesting these organisms may affect the oceanic nitrogen cycle, although these oceanic Crenarchaeota may also use other sources of energy. Vast numbers of archaea are also found in the sediments that cover the sea floor, with these organisms making up the majority of living cells at depths over 1 meter below the ocean bottom. It has been demonstrated that in all oceanic surface sediments (from 1000- to 10,000-m <b>water</b> <b>depth),</b> the impact of viral infection is higher on archaea than on bacteria and virus-induced lysis of archaea accounts for up to one-third of the total microbial biomass killed, resulting in the release of ~0.3 to 0.5 gigatons of carbon per year globally.|$|E
