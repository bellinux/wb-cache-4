5|$|<b>We</b> <b>really</b> {{wanted to}} do {{something}} that just shows who I am. We weren't trying to make a better version of myself. It was really more about fun and being spontaneous. All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive and I wanted the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E

25|$|Tim Cain, the producer, lead {{programmer}} {{and one of}} {{the main}} designers of the 1997 computer game Fallout, said: This book was how individual will handle thinking that he is the last survivor on Earth.

It was just really inspiring to be around someone that just hated everything that much. It was just great.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} {{discusses}} {{negative aspects of}} religion and society, and {{is seen as a}} [...] "companion piece" [...] to Enter Shikari’s A Flash Flood of Colour. Daybreaker lyrics were written by Carter and Tom Searle, who focused on political and [...] "bigger picture" [...] themes. Carter described [...] "Devil's Island" [...] as [...] "one of the hardest songs to write" [...] because of the prominence of its theme of rioting. Searle, who focused on its lyrics, said, [...] "With money firmly ingrained into our global society <b>we</b> <b>really</b> need to look to alternative solutions when problems like the riots occur because violence is never the solution". Carter said [...] "Black Blood", which was included on the re-release, is about the oil industry, society's strong dependence on oil and the way [...] "short term profit is the only thing these people think about, instead of the longevity of what <b>we</b> <b>really</b> could do and how we could stabilize what's really {{going on in the world}} right now".|$|E
