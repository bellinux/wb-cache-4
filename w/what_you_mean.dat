25|$|One likely {{reason for}} the {{relatively}} few Japanese words for 'fool' is vagueness. In both English and Japanese, the words for 'fool' have meanings that vary along scales of friendly-hostile, or joking-serious. In English, {{at one end of}} a scale are words like silly goose and at the other end are words like stupid asshole. And in Japanese, at one end are words like kamaboko baka 蒲鉾馬鹿 'silly chump' and at the other end are words like baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 'damn fool'. The difference is in the degree of lexical diversification along the scales of meaning. English seems to have more 'fool' words with more specificity – Japanese seems to have fewer 'fool' words with more vagueness. There are decided pragmatic and communicative advantages to such lexical vagueness. If you call me a stupid son-of-a-bitch, I know exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> But if you call me a baka-yarō, I cannot be so sure of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> The expression baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 {{is one of the most}} insulting terms in the Japanese lexicon, but it is vague and can range in meaning from an affectionate 'silly-willy' to an abusive 'jerk-off fool'. Baka-yarō is so widely used that it has become semantically weak and vague. Such vagueness can serve to conceal hostility and thus to maintain social harmony.|$|E

Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where x squared + px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.|$|E
500|$|... "I Will Be" [...] is a {{piano and}} guitar led song, which lasts for a {{duration}} of 3 minutes, 58 seconds. The song was composed {{in the key}} of G major using common time and a slow groove at 72beats per minute. Lewis's vocal range spans two octaves, from the low note of B3 to the high note of B5, on the song. The song opens with the lyrics [...] "There's nothing I could say to you, nothing I could ever do to make you see <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to me." [...] Chad Grischow for IGN described the song's piano led instrumental to be [...] "overblown", but noted that Lewis has enough [...] "vocal strength to prevent her from being overshadowed by the drowningly lush sound." [...] Eric R. Danton wrote on his review of Spirit for the Hartford Courant daily that [...] "I Will Be" [...] begins with a [...] "spare piano introduction" [...] that [...] "blossoms into an arrangement buoyed by strings and then drums and guitar". Danton described Lewis's vocals as [...] "delicate" [...] and that [...] "take flight on the chorus".|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of Glee second season, Lauren forms a {{relationship}} with local bad boy and football star Noah Puckerman. As the season progresses, Lauren and Puck's relationship continues to grow stronger. Their relationship begins to form in the ninth episode of the second season titled [...] "Special Education". After Puck attempts to recruit new members for the William McKinley High School glee club, members of the football team lock him in a port-a-potty. After being discovered by Lauren, he convinces her to join New Directions, despite her belief that show choir is stupid. Ashley Fink said of their relationship: [...] "I think Ryan Murphy has a master plan and we're all kind of along for the ride. I know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> but I wouldn't count us out just yet on that front. We all have to laugh at ourselves but it's going somewhere. Ultimately, {{it comes down to}} whether audiences will buy a relationship between Puck and Lauren. I think there's a really hilarious chemistry between Puck and Lauren. I think he's a badass, she's a badass. I don't know, I think they're funny together. There's something about {{the two of them together}} that I like, so I hope it's not outside the realm of possibility." ...|$|E
500|$|Idina Menzel, a Broadway veteran, {{was cast}} as Elsa. Menzel had {{formerly}} auditioned for Tangled, {{but did not}} get the part. However, Tangleds casting director, Jamie Sparer Roberts, preserved a recording of Menzel's performance on her iPhone, and on the basis of that, asked her to audition along with Bell for Frozen. Before they were officially cast, Menzel and Bell deeply impressed the directors and producers at an early table read; after reading the entire script out loud, they sang [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings" [...] together as a duet, since no music had been composed yet. Bell had suggested that idea when she visited Menzel at her California home to prepare together for the table read. The songwriters were also present for the table read; Anderson-Lopez said [...] "Lasseter was in heaven" [...] upon hearing Menzel and Bell sing in harmony, and from that moment forward, he insisted, [...] "Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel {{have to be in the}} movie!" [...] Lee said, [...] "They sung [...] it like sisters and <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to me nd there wasn't a dry eye in the house after they sang." [...] Between December 2012 and June 2013, the casting of additional roles was announced, including Jonathan Groff as Kristoff, Alan Tudyk as the Duke of Weselton, Santino Fontana as Prince Hans, and Josh Gad as Olaf.|$|E

He frequently referred to how Criss Angel's show Mind Freak had [...] "the perfect title, everyone knows <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> and you can advertise", which they could not. On an episode of the public radio program Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!, Penn referred to the show as Bushlit.|$|E

2500|$|On 22 May, Regenvanu was {{publicly}} criticised and ridiculed in Parliament by Internal Affairs Minister Patrick Crowby and Minister for Lands Harry Iauko, {{who read}} out an e-mail Regenvanu had been circulating, {{in which the}} young MP broadly accused his fellows of widespread corruption. He had also stated in the e-mail that Speaker of Parliament Maxime Carlot Korman would be [...] "buried" [...] if he attempted {{to stand in the}} 2012 general election. Carlot Korman addressed Regenvanu in these terms: [...] "I, along with your father are veteran politicians. I want you to explain to me <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> when you say you are going to bury me." [...] Regenvanu was compelled by the Speaker to offer an apology.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 November, Hannam, Hewett and {{the head}} of Eastbourne CID, Detective Inspector Pugh, searched Adams' house with a warrant issued (in Pugh's name) under the Dangerous Drugs Act 1951. When told they were looking for, [...] "Morphine, Heroin, Pethidine and the like", Adams was surprised: [...] "Oh, that group. You will find none here. I haven't any. I very seldom ever use them", he said. When Hannam asked for Adams' Dangerous Drugs Register – the record of those ordered and used – Adams responded: [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> I keep no register." [...] He had not kept one since 1949. When shown a list of {{dangerous}} drugs he had prescribed Morrell, and asked who administered them, Adams said, [...] "I did nearly all. Perhaps the nurses gave some but mostly me" [...] – contradicting what the nurses' notebooks would show during his trial. Hannam then observed, [...] "Doctor, you prescribed for her 75 – 1/6 grains heroin tablets the day before she died." [...] Adams replied, [...] "Poor soul, she was in terrible agony. It was all used. I used them myself [...] Do you think it is too much?" ...|$|E
