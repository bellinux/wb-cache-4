Meshed spur gear <b>windage</b> <b>power</b> loss test results are presented at ambient oil inlet temperatures both with and without shrouding. The rate of <b>windage</b> <b>power</b> loss is observed to increase above 10, 000 ft. min., gear surface speed, similar to results presented in the literature. Shrouding is observed to become more effective above 15, 000 ft. min., decreasing power loss by 10 at 25, 000 ft. min. The need for gearbox oil drain slots limits the effectiveness of shrouding on reducing <b>windage</b> <b>power</b> loss. Also, <b>windage</b> <b>power</b> loss is observed to decrease with increasing gearbox temperatures and to increase with oil flow. <b>Windage</b> <b>power</b> losses for the unshrouded meshed spur gears are 7 x more than losses determined from unshrouded single spur gear tests.

Its block was bored out to 4.04 in but 3.31 in stroke left unchanged, resulting in the 340 cu in (5.6 L). Anticipating higher loads resulting from racing operation, the engineers fitted a forged shot peened steel crankshaft instead of the cast nodular iron unit used in the 318. This also included shot peened and forged pushrods, connecting rods and pistons. A 4-barrel carburetor was mated to a high-rise, dual plane intake manifold feeding high-flow cylinder heads that are still considered among the best of that era. Its big ports used 2.02 in intake and 1.60 in exhaust valves. An aggressive cam was fitted {{to take advantage of}} the much better breathing top end. 1968 4-Speed cars got an even hotter cam, but it was discontinued for 1969, where both automatic and manual cars shared the same cam. The engine was equipped with hydraulic lifters and two bolt main bearing caps, leading some to initially underestimate the 340's potential. The '68-'71 340's compression ratio was 10.5:1, placing it near the limit of what was possible on pump gasoline during that era. The 340 also used additional heavy-duty parts, such as a double-row roller timing chain and sump-mounted <b>windage</b> tray. <b>Power</b> output was officially stated as [...] Gross for the 4 barrel.|$|R
40|$|Stirling {{cycle and}} Pulse Tube cryocoolers can be {{described}} by ideal thermodynamic cycles with discrete losses, however experiments show a systematic underestimate of power consumed. Existing correlations {{have been unable to}} explain the magnitude of this additional 'compression loss', but it can account for up to 50 % of the power delivered to the gas. It appears that even a modest decrease could significantly improve the efficiency of future machines. One problem inherent in studying this effect is the complex geometry of cryocoolers. Experiments have therefore been performed on an existing 'Oxford type' moving coil compressor with the simplest compression space geometry, a flat cylinder head. Measurements were made of the intrinsic motor losses (including <b>windage),</b> and the <b>power</b> delivered to the gas.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a numerical modelling strategy for simulating the flow around a shrouded spiral bevel gear. The strategy is then applied to a series of parametric variations of key shroud parameters. The shroud and gear in question are generic, although based upon those employed in the internal gear box of a Rolls-Royce aeroengine. The need to shroud the gear {{comes from the fact that}} a spiral bevel gear, when rotated, acts like a fan. Work is done by the gear to move the surrounding fluid, usually air with oil particles suspended in it, which creates a parasitic loss, referred to as the <b>windage</b> <b>power</b> loss. The work within this thesis is part of a larger project which has investigated how <b>windage</b> <b>power</b> loss can be affected by geometric features of gears and shrouds. This is important as for large diameter (> 200 mm) bevel gears running at high speeds (> 10, 000 RPM) the <b>windage</b> <b>power</b> loss forms a substantial part of the total power loss. The modelling strategy has been developed in this work by studying 4 different fluid flow settings: Taylor-Couette flow, Conical Taylor-Couette flow, an unshrouded spiral bevel gear, and a shrouded spiral bevel gear. Work on Taylor-Couette flow provided a basic setting in which to trial various numerical techniques and gain familiarity with the commercial CFD program which would be used throughout this thesis (FLUENT), along with the meshing program GAMBIT. It gave an understanding of the flow, which was then used to simulate the flow in a modification of Taylor-Couette flow where the cylinders are replaced with cones, called Conical Taylor-Couette flow. Comparisons were made between 4 popular turbulence models, allowing a decision to be made on the `best' turbulence model to use in the modelling of a shrouded gear, and to start to develop the strategy. This strategy was then applied to the more complex geometry of an unshrouded gear, simulating experimental data which had been created on an in-house rig. To confirm the applicability of the strategy to modelling shrouded spiral bevel gears, it was applied to two shrouds for which experimental data was available. It showed that numerical modelling can capture the relative performance of the shrouds well. The work then continued by considering a series of parametric variations, whereby 3 key shroud parameters are each varied in 3 manners, producing 27 variations. Each of these parameters can affect the <b>windage</b> <b>power</b> loss: an assessment of how much each parameter affects <b>windage</b> <b>power</b> loss has been given. A description of the flow field in `good' and `bad' cases has been given, and through approximating the flow by using the compressible form of Bernoulli's equation, reasons for a `bad' shroud being `bad' have been presented...|$|E

40|$|Gearbox {{efficiency}} is reduced at high rotational speeds due to windage drag and viscous effects on rotating, meshed gear components. A goal of NASA aeronautics rotorcraft research {{is aimed at}} propulsion technologies that improve efficiency while minimizing vehicle weight. Specifically, reducing power losses to rotorcraft gearboxes would allow gains {{in areas such as}} vehicle payload, range, mission type, and fuel consumption. To that end, a gear windage rig has been commissioned at NASA Glenn Research Center to measure windage drag on gears and to test methodologies to mitigate <b>windage</b> <b>power</b> losses. One method used in rotorcraft gearbox design attempts to reduce gear <b>windage</b> <b>power</b> loss by utilizing close clearance walls to enclose the gears in both the axial and radial directions. The close clearance shrouds result in reduced drag on the gear teeth and reduced power loss. For meshed spur gears, the shrouding takes the form of metal side plates and circumferential metal sectors. Variably positioned axial and radial shrouds are incorporated in the NASA rig to study the effect of shroud clearance on gearbox power loss. A number of researchers have given experimental and analytical results for single spur gears, with and without shrouding. Shrouded meshed spur gear test results are sparse in the literature. Windage tests were run at NASA Glenn using meshed spur gears at four shroud configurations: unshrouded, shrouded (max. axial, max. radial), and two intermediate shrouding conditions.

40|$|In this paper, {{a set of}} {{correlations}} for the <b>windage</b> <b>power</b> losses in a 4 kW axial flux permanent magnet synchronous machine (AFPMSM) is presented. In order to have an efficient machine, {{it is necessary to}} optimize the total electromagnetic and mechanical losses. Therefore, fast equations are needed to estimate the <b>windage</b> <b>power</b> losses of the machine. The geometry consists of an open rotor–stator with sixteen magnets at the periphery of the rotor with an annular opening in the entire disk. Air can flow in a channel being formed between the magnets and in a small gap region between the magnets and the stator surface. To construct the correlations, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations through the frozen rotor (FR) method are performed at the practical ranges of the geometrical parameters, namely the gap size distance, the rotational speed of the rotor, the magnet thickness and the magnet angle. Thereafter, two categories of formulations are defined to make the windage losses dimensionless based on whether the losses are mainly due to the viscous forces or the pressure forces. At the end, the correlations can be achieved via curve fittings from the numerical data. The results reveal that the pressure forces are responsible for the windage losses for the side surfaces in the air-channel, whereas for the surfaces facing the stator surface in the gap, the viscous forces mainly contribute to the windage losses. Additionally, the results of the parametric study demonstrate that the overall windage losses in the machine escalate with an increase in either the rotational Reynolds number or the magnet thickness ratio. By contrast, the windage losses decrease once the magnet angle ratio enlarges. Moreover, it can be concluded that the proposed correlations are very useful tools in the design and optimizations of this type of electrical machine...|$|E

40|$|In many aeroengines the {{accessory}} power offtake is achieved using a {{spiral bevel gear}} set running {{off one of the}} main shafts. The crown and bevel gears are housed in an internal gearbox and there is significant heat generation within this chamber, some of which is attributed to <b>windage</b> <b>power</b> loss (WPL) generated by the gear. Over the past few years the University of Nottingham Technology Centre (UTC) in Gas Turbine Transmissions has been researching spiral bevel gear <b>windage</b> <b>power</b> loss both computationally and experimentally using a purpose-built test rig at the UTC. In this study the test rig has been adapted such that chamber pressures up to 8 bar can be generated. Test data has been obtained that shows the effect on WPL of chamber pressure, advancing understanding of the relationship between data obtained at ambient and pressurised conditions. Three configurations have been studied: unshrouded gear, gear with 360 shroud and shrouded, crown and pinion meshing pair. Further, the effect of oil mist within the chamber on WPL has been studied. An oil mist generation system was developed for introducing a fine mist into the chamber and results are presented for varying mist flowrates. A mist measurement system was developed to sample mist mass fraction within the chamber and the data obtained is used to calculate an effective (oil/gas mixture) chamber density. Increasing chamber pressure increases Reynolds number, moving the system behavior further along the Moment coefficient-Reynolds number correlation. The Cm-Re correlation is similar in form to that for a shrouded cone, showing transitional behavior around Re= 2 x 106. Beyond transition Cm decreases with increasing Re. Introducing an oil spray has two effects: reduction in chamber temperature and increase in effective density of chamber fluid. Both effects can be accounted for by calculating Re and Cm based on mixture properties but it seems highly likely that the properties of the fluid under the shroud differ from those of the fluid in the external chamber. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWhen {{considering}} high-speed gear transmission, {{the power}} loss {{due to the}} fluid drag torque generated by the gear rotation in air/oil mist may dominate the other losses.

However the influence of helix angle is not clearly understood since most of the previous studies considered spur gears.

The purpose of this paper is to build a numerical model using CFD method which is capable to estimate WPL generated by helical gears whose characteristics differ from their helix angle values.

40|$|Within {{a gearbox}} the {{majority}} of transmission losses {{can be attributed to}} bearing losses, meshing losses, or losses due to windage/churning. In this paper the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code Fluent 6. 2. 16 is applied in a two-dimensional study of <b>windage</b> <b>power</b> loss (WPL) from a single spur gear rotating in air. By comparing CFD data to published experimental data appropriate grid density and modelling parameters are identified. The model is used to investigate how peripheral shrouding affects WPL and whether WPL can be reduced through minor modifications to tooth tip geometry. Non-dimensional shroud spacings (ratio of gap to gear PCD) of between 0. 005 and 0. 05 were investigated at shaft speeds between 5000 and 20 000 r/min. Although CFD data compared reasonably well to experimental data, trends were not reproduced and an optimum shroud could not be identified. A full three-dimensional study is recommended. Modifying the tooth tip by adding a small chamfer on the leading edge reduced WPL by 6 per cent. A small fillet increased total WPL by a similar amount suggesting that WPL may increase as a gear wears. This preliminary study suggests further work in this area would be beneficial...|$|E
40|$|In many aero-engines, {{the power}} to drive {{accessories}} is transmitted through high speed bevel gears in a chamber {{in the center of}} the engine. The <b>windage</b> <b>power</b> loss (WPL) associated with these gears makes a significant contribution to the overall heat generation within the chamber. Shrouding the gears provides an effective method of reducing this WPL and managing the flow of lubricating oil. Experimental and computational programs at the University of Nottingham Technology Centre in Gas Turbine Transmission Systems are providing an improved understanding of shroud performance and design. This paper presents the results from a pair of shrouded meshing gears run at representative speeds and oil flow in a rig with speed and torque measurement. A previously published study of a single bevel gear operating in air (Johnson, 2007, “Experimental Investigation Into <b>Windage</b> <b>Power</b> Loss From a Shrouded Spiral Bevel Gear” ASME Paper No. GT 2007 - 27885) found a reduction in torque of up to 70 % from shrouding. In this work, the addition of oil and the pinion gear did not lead to high torque due to the buildup of oil under the shrouds, but the reduction in torque due to fitting the shrouds is significantly less than was found for the same gear in air alone. In order to isolate the various parameters, further testing with a single gear was carried out. A fully (360 deg) shrouded gear shows a big improvement over an unshrouded gear when running in air alone, but much of this benefit disappears as soon as a very small amount of oil is introduced under the shroud. This implies that the oil is recirculating under the shroud. Increasing the oil flow beyond this initial level increases the torque by the amount required to accelerate the oil mass flow up to the peripheral speed of the gear. Providing a full width slot in the shroud downstream of the oil jet allows the oil to escape without any recirculation and restores much of the benefit of the shroud. Further insight into the oil behavior is obtained from torque measurements and observations through a transparent shroud and with various slot configurations. Video observation shows evidence of a vortex flow under the shroud that carries some of the oil toward the inner diameter of the gear. The three main windage contributors, air alone, recirculation of oil under the shroud, and acceleration of the feed oil, are quantified and methods for achieving the optimum design are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Effi ciency is {{becoming}} more and more a main concern in the design of power transmissions and the demand for high effi ciency gearboxes is continuously increasing. Also the more and more restric-tive euro standards for the reduction of pollutant emissions from light vehicles impose to improve the effi ciency of the engines but also of the gear transmissions. For this reason the resources dedicated to this goal are continuously increasing. The fi rst step to improve effi ciency is to have appropriate models to compare different design solutions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes a}} numerical modelling strategy for characterising the windage of a {{spiral bevel gear}} rotating within a static shroud. The techniques employed {{include the use of}} a parametric solid model, and flow field modelling using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. A number of hypothetical physical alterations are made to a control system consisting of a gear and a shroud, based on those found in a Rolls-Royce aero engine. Windage is a parasitic power loss that occurs when a gear does work on air and oil within a gas turbine internal gearbox. It leads to degradation of the oil, which wears turbo-machinery and bearing components, shortening their lives. <b>Windage</b> <b>power</b> losses also impact upon the fuel consumption of an engine, reducing its environmental credentials. The requirement of the oil is to cool and lubricate the meshing location of a pair of gears and for it to then be removed from the vicinity of the gear - preventing its re-ingestion and recirculation. The best solution to these issues of reducing windage and managing the oil is to shroud the gear effectively. Additional cooling of oil can mitigate the damage of too much heat generation, but this adds weight and expense to an engine. A parametric model of a shrouded spiral bevel gear is created, which allows for changes to be made to single or multiple dimensions of the gear and shroud. A control volume CFD approach is used, with a single tooth of a gear modelled to reduce computational time. Four gear size variables are tested: inner diameter, outer diameter, cone angle and module (number of teeth). Findings for air-only show that windage can be reduced by: increasing the cone angle; increasing the number of teeth; or decreasing the outer diameter. The effect of changing the inner diameter on windage was found to be complex due to the interaction of gear and shroud upon the system results, but far less significant than the outer diameter, as windage was seen to scale by this variable to the power of 4. 3. Changes to the design of the shroud are made, with a comparison of five inlet and five outlet designs. It is found that a sudden restriction at the inlet to the shroud is the most effective way of reducing single phase windage, with additional shroud features that make the flow path more tortuous also helping. The outlet of the shroud is shown to increase windage as it is opened up and permitted to be less restrictive. A series of investigations using a Lagrangian discrete particle model (DPM) to simulate the presence of oil droplets within the system are also presented. It is shown that the destination of oil within the domain is predominantly dictated by the source location of the oil, with little sensitivity to initial velocity or size. Film modelling {{on the surface of the}} shroud, using the DPM-based film model, allows the motion of a thin layer of oil to be studied. In conjunction with the five shroud outlet designs, it is shown that a less restrictive, more open shroud outlet design will help prevent re-ingestion of oil that is present within the shrouded area of the gear...|$|E
