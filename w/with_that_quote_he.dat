5000|$|Wylly's {{political}} acting {{of defending}} minority rights and his very existence as an openly gay congress member {{and human rights}} activist have transformed him in a public enemy of conservative political forces in Brazil. In {{a country with a}} wide rate of homophobic crimes as Brazil, he began to receive death threats that became more recurrent since his political enemies started a slanderous campaign against him by posting and sharing in social media like Facebook images <b>with</b> <b>quotes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> have supposedly said about being an openly pedophile defender, for example. Among other quotes attributed to him, the one that he had affirmed that the Bible was [...] "a joke" [...] Christians and Bible followers were “clowns” was highly spread. In spite of those quotes had never been existed, people in social networks still share them, strengthening the ongoing hate campaign against Wyllys. To clean up his image damaged by that orchestrated campaign, he created a section on his official webpage where he refutes all the quotes attributed to him. Although his political image in the public sphere had been degraded by the slanderous campaign, he ran for congress once again in 2014 and kept his chair in the parliament with more than 100,000 votes, being the seventh most voted representative of Rio de Janeiro.|$|R
50|$|As an English {{teacher and}} {{lecturer}} at Albert Mission College, Krishna has led a mundane and monotonous lifestyle {{comparable to that}} of a cow. He too plays an important role of protecting the Indian cullture. Soon his life took a turn when his wife, Susila, and their child, Leela, come to live with him. With their welfare on his hands, Krishna learns to be a proper husband and learns how to accept the responsibility of taking care of his family. He felt that his life had comparatively improved, as he understood that there's more meaning to life than to just teaching in the college. However, on the day when they went in search of a new house, Susila contracts typhoid after visiting a dirty lavatory, keeping her in bed for weeks. Throughout the entire course of her illness, Krishna constantly tries to keep an optimistic view about Susila's illness, keeping his hopes up by thinking that her illness would soon be cured. However, Susila eventually succumbs and passes away. Krishna, destroyed by her loss, has suicidal thoughts but gives them up {{for the sake of his}} daughter, Leela. He leads his life as a lost and miserable person after her death, but after he receives a letter from a stranger who indicates that Susila has been in contact <b>with</b> him and <b>that</b> she wants to communicate with Krishna, he becomes more collected and cheerful. This leads to Krishna’s journey in search of enlightenment, with the stranger acting as a medium to Susila in the spiritual world. Leela, on the other hand, goes to a preschool where Krishna gets to meet the headmaster, a profound man who cared for the students in his school and teaches them moral values through his own methods. The Headmaster puts his students as his top priority but he doesn’t care for his own family and children, eventually leaving them on the day predicted by an astrologer as to be when he was going to die, which did not come true. Krishna gets to learn through the headmaster on the journey to enlightenment; eventually learning to communicate to Susila on his own, thus concluding the entire story itself, <b>with</b> the <b>quote</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> felt 'a moment of rare immutable joy'.|$|R
