Multitimbered configurations are wood cribs that are constructed with two or more timbers per layer. Nine different crib configurations were evaluated. Configuration parameters under study included the aspect ratio (height-to-width relationship) {{and the percentage of}} solid rr:aterial used in crib construction. Test results and generalized wood crib behavior are discussed and recommendations are made concerning crib constructions to maximize strength and stability. Crib performance is enhanced by reducing buckling effects by decreasing the aspect ratio and geometry considerations that increase the moment of inertia. A cost benefit analysis of multitimbered wood crib configurations is made. Generally, increasing the percentage of solid provides more resistance at less unit construction cost. A comparison of laboratory results and underground observations of several <b>wood</b> <b>pack</b> wall supports suggest in situ load capacity is less than that measured in laboratory testing. Reasons for the apparent decrease of in situ load-bearing capability include load rate effects, stiffness of reaction surfaces, and varying boundary conditions that alter the load transfer mechanics of the crib structure...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a quantitative methodology {{for evaluating the}} probability of invasive pest species establishing persistent populations. The estimation of pest establishment relies on data and information describing the biology and ecology of the pest and its interactions with potential host species and the regional environment. This information is developed using a model construct borrowed from theoretical population ecology. The methodology for esti-mating the probability of pest establishment {{is part of an}} overall framework that explores the implications of reductions in pest invasions on subsequent establishment. The risk reduction framework integrates the engineering aspects of different technologies for reducing pest en-try, the biology and ecology of pest species, the suitability of potentially susceptible hosts, and the quality of available habitats. The methodology for estimating the risk of establishment is presented using an example pest, the Asian longhorned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis), which has been introduced into the United States via solid <b>wood</b> <b>packing</b> materials (SWPM) used in international commerce. Uncertainties inherent to the estimation of model parameters that determine the risk of establishment are defined, quantified, and propagated through the population model. Advantages and limitations of the proposed methodology are discussed along with recommendations to make the approach more useful in the management of risks posed by the establishment of pest populations.

Using a 485 -bp-long fragment of the mitochondrial barcode gene (COI), we studied the genetic diversity and structure of ALB populations in both native and invaded ranges, with a specific focus on Europe. Three main haplotypes were found across the native and invaded distribution of ALB. The native area in Asia was the most diverse with 23 haplotypes, but a low genetic structure was observed. Our results revealed up to nine distinct haplotypes that was diverged by no more than six mutational steps in European populations collected from 2001 to 2016. Nevertheless, the genetic structure was characterized by one widespread dominant haplotype in Europe. The overall complex genetic structure observed in Europe suggested a convoluted invasion scenario. Indeed, invasion history may include several introduction events as well as secondary dispersal.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Trametes versicolor and Bjerkandera sp BOL 13 were {{compared}} for decolorization of azo dyes supplied individually or as a mixture. The dye decolorization was also evaluated during continuous treatment under non-sterile conditions using a lignocellulosic growth substrate. RESULTS: Bjerkandera sp BOL 13 showed the highest dye decolorization potential. This fungus {{was also found}} to support high decolorization of Remazol Red RR at an initial pH of 4 - 6 and when using straw as co-substrate. The fungus was evaluated for Remazol Red RR decolorization in a continuously fed packed-bed bioreactor operated under non-sterile conditions with 3 days of hydraulic retention time. When glucose was supplied as growth-substrate, decolorization efficiencies of 65 - 90 % were maintained for 12 days in a bioreactor packed with wooden material. The decolorization efficiency was lower when glucose was not fed to the fungus or when a plastic material was used as packing. Higher manganese peroxidase and laccase activities were also recorded when the <b>wood</b> <b>packing</b> was used. Contamination caused a drop in decolorization efficiency after 17 - 19 days operation. CONCLUSIONS: The potential of Bjerkandera sp BOL 13 for decolorization of azo dyes under non-sterile conditions using lignocellulosic growth substrates was demonstrated. Research is needed to reduce contamination under non-sterile conditions. (c) 2012 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|E

40|$|Nonindigenous {{species have}} caused {{significant}} impacts to North American forests despite {{past and present}} international phytosanitary efforts. Though broadly acknowledged, the risks of pest invasions are difficult to quantify as they involve interactions between many factors that operate {{across a range of}} spatial and temporal scales: the transmission of invading organisms via various pathways, their spread and establishment in new environments. Our study presents a stochastic simulation approach to quantify these risks and associated uncertainties through time in a unified fashion. We outline this approach with an example of a forest pest recently detected in North America, Sirex noctilio Fabricius. We simulate new potential entries of S. noctilio as a stochastic process, based on recent volumes of marine shipments of commodities from countries where S. noctilio is established, as well as the broad dynamics of foreign marine imports. The results are then linked with a spatial model that simulates the spread of S. noctilio within the geographical distribution of its hosts (pines) while incorporating existing knowledge about its behavior in North American landscapes. Through replications, this approach yields a spatial representation of S. noctilio risks and uncertainties in a single integrated product. The approach should also be appealing to decisionmakers, since it accounts for projected flows of commodities that may serve as conduits for pest entry. Our 30 -year forecasts indicate high establishment probability in Ontario, Quebec, and the northeastern United States, but further southward expansion of S. noctilio is uncertain, ultimately depending on the impact of recent international treatment standards for <b>wood</b> <b>packing</b> materials.

40|$|The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (MP) {{seeks to}} {{eliminate}} emissions {{to the atmosphere}} of all ozone-depleting gases. This includes emissions of methyl bromide fumigant. Phaseout of production and consumption of methyl bromide, quarantine and pre-shipment (QPS) uses excepted, is now well advanced. This includes phaseout of non-exempt uses on postharvest durable commodities and structures. Annual non-QPS use on structures and postharvest durable foodstuffs is now less than 300 tonnes a year globally. There are potential alternatives for almost all remaining non-QPS uses on post-harvest durables. Their actual adoption is constrained by regulatory/registration issues {{in a number of}} countries where there is a great need for rapid treatment to meet transport and harvesting schedules. A few recalcitrant and specialised uses remain without recognised alternatives, notably for disinfestation of some high moisture dates immediately postharvest. QPS uses continue to be exempted from control under the agreed MP control measures for methyl bromide. Production of methyl bromide for QPS uses is now the largest new production on an ozone-depleting substance for an emissive use unregulated under the Montreal Protocol. Regulation of emissions from QPS treatments is under continuing discussion, with a decision whether or not to bring emissions from QPS under some form of MP control possible in late 2010.

40|$|Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB), Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) (Coleoptera; Cerambycidae), is an {{invasive}} beetle that {{attacks and}} kills living and stressed host trees. Throughout the USA, ALB poses a serious {{economic and environmental}} threat to city, urban, rural and forested areas. ALB {{has an impact on}} the people and industries that depend on these natural resources and the environment in which they live. The woodborer attacks 13 genera of hardwood tree species in the USA. Preferred hosts include Acer spp. (maple, boxelder), Betula spp. (birch), Ulmus spp. (elm), Salix spp. (willow), and Aesculus spp. (horsechestnut, buckeye). In 2009, the United States Forest Service (USFS) estimated that throughout the USA about 169 million acres of forested habitat with maple species is vulnerable to attack from ALB. The estimated maximum potential national urban impact of ALB is a loss of 34. 9 % of total canopy cover, 30. 3 % tree mortality (1. 2 billion trees) and value loss of $ 669 billion USD (Nowak et al. 2001). Given the range of affected species, other potential adverse impacts include the forest products industry (lumber and furniture), nursery stock industry, maple syrup production, and fall-foliage tourism. Loss of trees also decreases property values, causes aesthetic damage, and lessens the environmental benefits of trees. Potential environmental impacts would be wide-ranging and not restricted to the loss of host trees. Negative impacts to soil and water quality will occur, as well as impacts to fish and wildlife, including threatened and endangered species that depend on host trees. The loss of ecological function related to host-tree loss would also impact natural resource management activities and add an additional stressor to forests that are already impacted due to other manmade and natural factors. The beetle potentially can alter the ecological diversity of the natural forests in North America. ([URL] technology/invasives_anoplophoraglabripennis_riskmaps. shtml) In 2010, USDA APHIS began a multiyear cooperative agreement with Pennsylvania State University and the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies to determine the potential ecological and economic impacts of ALB invasions in the northeast USA Forests, providing no eradication or management actions occur. Results show that 45 % of the adult trees in eastern USA forests are at risk for ALB infestation (current USA ALB host list), including maples (sugar and red maples), birches, poplar, and elms. Red maple and sugar maple are the two most abundant tree species in the eastern USA (all states from Minnesota south to Louisiana and eastward). Sugar maple is an ecologically important species in late successional and old growth forests. Red maple occurs across a range of environments from ridge tops to swamps. Both species are distributed throughout the eastern USA. Virtually all individuals of preferred host trees are expected to die within 10 – 20 years following ALB invasion of a stand. Loss of preferred tree species triggers replacement by non-preferred tree species. However, in many regions of the USA, species that are expected to replace the species at risk from ALB are themselves threatened by other introduced pests and/or pathogens, such as Beech Bark Disease and Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (Adelges tsugae (Annand)). The net effect is the significant reduction of the merchantable volume of timber in eastern forests over at least the next 50 years. Based {{on the assumption that the}} outbreak occurs everywhere at the same time, the apex of the outbreak is estimated at year 25 when over 71 billion board-feet are anticipated to be killed by ALB throughout the study region. Over 100 years, about 850 billion feet are expected to be killed by ALB in the region. Reduction in timber volume is mirrored in reductions in carbon storage and represents a significant reduction in the strength of the sink for CO 2 in eastern forests. (Canham, Jacobson, 2012, personal communication). On several occasions during the 1980 s and 1990 s, ALB was intercepted at ports of entry in solid <b>wood</b> <b>packing</b> materials (SWPM) as part of international commerce. The first established population of ALB was discovered in New York City (1996) and then in Chicago (1998). Subsequently, ALB has been found in New Jersey near New York City (2002), Middlesex/Union Counties New Jersey (2004), Worcester, Massachusetts (2008), and Boston, MA (2010), and recently in Bethel, OH (2011). On March 9, 1999, the US Secretary of Agriculture officially declared the discovery of ALB an emergency, paving the way to obtain funding to address the SWPM pathway and contain and control the outbreaks, and eradicate the ALB wherever it may be found in the USA. Potential losses from an unchecked outbreak are high. However, eradication is possible given the biology of ALB, current extent of infestation, and available treatment options. Compared with other forest insect pests, such as Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), ALB has a low reproduction rate and does not naturally disperse long distances. Current infestation areas in the USA are also comparatively small, and effective control techniques are available. However, they are costly and involve destruction of infested trees and chemical treatment of exposed host trees. Eradication efforts have been successful in Illinois and New Jersey and certain areas of New York. Similar results are expected within several years in other areas of New York where USDA APHIS eradication efforts are underway. Successful eradication depends on many factors including strong stakeholder support and sufficient resources to carry out effective eradication efforts. Here we report on the ALB cooperative eradication national program with a focus on the key elements in the successful eradication programthat centered in Chicago, Illinois during 1998 to 2008.

40|$|Nitrogen {{removal from}} {{wastewater}} {{is accomplished by}} nitrification and denitrification processes. Successful denitrification requires carbon, therefore, if placed after biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and nitrification process, a carbon source has to be re-introduced into the water. To avoid adding a carbon source, denitrification is usually placed before BOD and nitrification processes. This process however involves recycling the nitrified effluent. In this study wood chips were used as internal carbon source which enabled placement of denitrification after BOD and nitrification process without effluent recycling. To investigate the efficiency of a <b>wood</b> <b>packed</b> aerobic-anaerobic baffled reactor on carbon and nutrients removal from domestic wastewater, a three compartment baffled reactor was presented. Each of the three compartments was packed with 329 g wood chips 1 x 1 cm acting as an internal carbon source for denitrification.

The operating temperature, hydraulic retention time (HRT), dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH were 24 ± 2 ℃, 24 h, less than 4 mg/L and 7 ± 1 respectively. The removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH 4 +-N) and total nitrogen (TN) attained was 99, 87 and 83 % respectively. TN removal rate was limited by nitrification as 97 % of ammonia converted into nitrate and nitrite was denitrified. These results show that application of wood chips in wastewater treatment processes is an efficient internal carbon source...|$|R
