2500|$|In late 1992, when {{living in}} Los Angeles, Kelly {{recorded}} ten tracks {{for his next}} album, Wanted Man, at three studios: Stagg St, Clearlake and O'Henry. Kelly returned to Australia in 1993 and had a book collection of lyrics published, aptly titled Lyrics. In Melbourne he recorded three more tracks at the Metropolis Studio. The album was produced by Kelly, Randy Jacobs (member of [...] Was (Not Was)) and David Bridie (produced My Friend the Chocolate Cake's 1991 self-titled album). Jacobs and Kelly co-wrote [...] "Ball and Chain". The first track, [...] "Summer Rain", deals with a man's yearning for his girlfriend, Kelly thought the sentiment would translate well but found a curious Belgian interviewer asked, [...] "But <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>anybody</b> long for rain in summer? ... We get enough rain in winter. We don't want the summer rain. We want the sunshine". The lead single, [...] "Songs from the Sixteenth Floor" [...] was written by Kelly with John Clifforth of Deckchairs Overboard. The next single, [...] "Love Never Runs on Time" [...] was written by Kelly. The lyrics describe a truck driver struggling to meet his commitments to work and family. [...] Kelly uses the same protagonist from [...] "To Her Door" [...] on 1987's Under the Sun and then again in 1996's [...] "How to Make Gravy" [...] from the extended play How to Make Gravy. In the first song, the man moves from being newly married to having children and problems with a drug addiction and undergoing rehab to returning to the family home. By the time of [...] "How to Make Gravy", the man is in prison for assault and is writing {{a letter to his}} brother for Christmas. In 2002 Debbie Kruger of Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA) interviewed Kelly and found, [...] "Kelly’s attraction to the theatrical, however unconscious, has meant occasionally a song’s character will pop up again, sometimes unintentionally". Kelly conceded the three songs were linked, [...] "'I’ve got a feeling it’s the same guy. He keeps coming back'. Maybe he’ll be in a happier place next time? 'Yeah, he’s a bit of a fuck-up, that guy', Kelly laughs".|$|E

Perhaps because filming this material {{could not possibly have}} been a happy experience for anyone—not if it's taken seriously. Roger Ebert The film opened with a limited release on 6 August 1982 and entered at No. 28 of the US box office charts despite only playing in one theatre on its first weekend, grossing over $68,000, a rare feat even by today's standards. The film then spent just over a month below the top 20 while still in the top 30. The film later expanded to over 600 theatres on 10 September, achieving No. 3 at the box office charts, below E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and An Officer and a Gentleman. The film eventually earned $22 million before closing in early 1983.|$|E

Writing in his column he described Jedward as 'vain', and criticised ITV for cancelling shows like The Bill, whilst producing a 'long, weird and increasingly scary show'. Kevin O'Sullivan, also of The Daily Mirror, was also critical of the show.

[...] Subsequently, Jen Gunter, an obstetrician-gynecologist and blogger - identified research that Carson himself had performed and published using tissue from fetuses aborted in the 9th and 17th weeks of gestation. Carson defended his past use of tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research in part, by stating, [...] "to not use the tissue that is in a tissue bank, regardless of where it comes from, would be foolish. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>anybody</b> not do that?" [...] Carson also told the Washington Post: [...] "If you're killing babies and taking the tissue, that's a very different thing than taking a dead specimen and keeping a record of it." ...|$|E

Because pages are gener-ated dynamically, {{one might expect}} that pages without a Last-Modified header are fine, and that an If-Modified-Since header in the client’s request can be ignored.

If the number of hits on your server is not significant and is never going to be, then it is safe to skip this chapter.

Since he won the award before 1950, he was not required to offer it to the Academy first. Russell defended his decision, saying, [...] "I don't know <b>why</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> be critical. My wife's health {{is much more important}} than sentimental reasons.

40|$|The public {{believes}} {{that science is}} all about developing technology. What {{does this mean for}} science? Irecently had an interesting conversation with an executive engineer from a spaceflight company. Our conversation began with satellites and rockets but soon came around to the Higgs boson discovery at CERN. With a concerned expression, he bluntly told me he did not understand <b>why</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> spend billions of dollars just to see a tiny particle that exists only for an instant. I was taken aback. Here was a man who had spent his whole life as an engineer—surely he should appreciate the value of scientific discovery, especially something as fundamental as the explanation for mass. Apparently, he did not. That attitude seems increasingly common today. Traditionally, the goal of science has been elucidating nature and discovering its laws. However, the public now seems to view science's primary goal as developing technology and creating products.

40|$|Many {{countries}} nowadays {{have made}} strict rules (and rightly so) for collectors, partly {{for the protection}} of the flora and fauna and to thwart unscrupulous exterminators of butterflies and orchids, partly, we suspect, also as a check on industrial espionage. Obviously, administrators behind their desks have no inkling of what dedicated botanists (and zoologists) are doing in the forest. Especially when the scientists come from the so-called ’rich’ countries the civil servants ask themselves <b>why</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>would</b> like to exchange a nice chair in an air-conditioned office with a lot of paper work for a most uncomfortable, hard log under a leaky fly in an insect-infested, humid, scary forest. Since they themselves certainly are not going to take a look there for themselves, they suspect other motives, and until they find out what these are, scientists are under suspicion and should be kept on a leash. Sometimes the requirements border on the ridiculous, as a few instances that have come to attention show: Unicates must be left with the host institute and can only be had on loan.
