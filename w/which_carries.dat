Kiarostami fastened cameras to the dashboard of a car, and then allowed his actors to act. There was no film crew in the car, and no director. There is no camera movement, {{other than the}} movement of the car <b>which</b> <b>carries</b> the camera. There is minimal cutting and editing.|$|E

5|$|Indonesian {{law does}} not require that arrested people be {{immediately}} charged with an offence, and by 22 April 2005 no charges had yet been laid. Police indicated that the five arrested at the airport would be charged with drug trafficking, <b>which</b> <b>carries</b> the death penalty, while those arrested in the hotel would be charged with the lesser offence of drug possession, <b>which</b> <b>carries</b> a maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment. It was suggested that Andrew Chan recruited the other eight to act as drug mules – couriers who would not arouse suspicion while carrying heroin to Australia – and offered them A$10,000 to A$15,000 each {{to carry out this}} task, and given A$5000 spending cash.|$|E

5|$|PA 222 {{heads into}} {{downtown}} Allentown, where it splits into a one-way pair at 12th Street. Northbound PA 222 turns south onto 12th Street and east onto Walnut Street while southbound PA 222 runs west along Linden Street to 12th Street, following 12th Street south to Hamilton Street. Walnut Street is two lanes and two-way until 10th Street, where it becomes one-way with two northbound lanes heading east, while Linden Street {{is one way}} southbound with two lanes heading west. The one-way paring continues east past homes and businesses in the downtown area. Southbound PA 222 passes {{to the north of}} the PPL Center sports arena, where the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the American Hockey League and the Lehigh Valley Steelhawks of the National Arena League play, between 8th and 7th streets.

40|$|Both "large-U" and "small-U" orbitals {{are used}} to study the {{electronic}} structure of the high-T_c cuprates. A striped structure with three types of carriers are induced, polaron-like "stripons" <b>which</b> <b>carry</b> charge, "quasielectrons" <b>which</b> <b>carry</b> both charge and spin, and "svivons" <b>which</b> <b>carry</b> spin and lattice distortion. Anomalous physical properties of the cuprates are derived, and specifically the systematic behavior of the resistivity, Hall constant, and thermoelectric power. Transitions between pair states of quasielectrons and stripons drive high-temperature superconductivity. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

The analysis of the Polish equivalents of Indonesian idioms covers stable set phrases <b>which</b> <b>carry</b> the same image, idioms <b>which</b> <b>carry</b> an analogous image, and idioms with identical meaning <b>which</b> <b>carry</b> a different image.

5|$|Still {{travelling}} {{alongside a}} power transmission corridor, Highway407 crosses a complex rail wye which {{provides access to}} the CN freight yards to the north. After interchanging with Keele Street (York Regional Road6), the route gently curves northward, passing under the CN Newmarket Subdivision, <b>which</b> <b>carries</b> the GO Transit Barrie Line and crossing the Don River. It curves back eastward as it interchanges with Dufferin Street (York Regional Road53), travelling adjacent and south of Highway7. After interchanges with Bathurst Street (York Regional Road38) and Yonge Street (York Regional Road1), the Vaughan–Markham boundary, Highway407 crosses the CN Bala Subdivision, <b>which</b> <b>carries</b> the GO Transit Richmond Hill Line. After an interchange with Bayview Avenue (York Regional Road34), the highway swerves south.

In the approach to Brighton, Grand River Avenue passes through rural southeast Michigan lake country. In Brighton, Grand River Avenue crossed the western end of the I-96 freeway. US16 merged onto the freeway, and I-96/US16 met the northern end of the US23 freeway. I-96/US16 continued east into Oakland County through Wixom and Novi.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, {{broadcast}} {{rights to}} the Masters are held by Bell Media, with coverage divided between TSN (cable), <b>which</b> <b>carries</b> live simulcasts and primetime encores of CBS and ESPN coverage for all four rounds, CTV (broadcast), which simulcasts CBS's coverage of the weekend rounds, and RDS, <b>which</b> <b>carries</b> French-language coverage. Prior to 2013, Canadian broadcast rights were held by a marketing company, Graham Sanborn Media, which in turn bought time on the Global Television Network, TSN, and RDS (except for 2012 when French-language coverage aired on TVA and TVA Sports) to air the broadcasts, also selling all of the advertising for the Canadian broadcasts. This was an unusual arrangement in Canadian sports broadcasting, as in most cases broadcasters acquire their rights directly from the event organizers or through partnerships with international rightsholders, such as ESPN International (ESPN owns a minority stake in TSN). In 2013, Global and TSN began selling advertising directly, and jointly produced their own preview and highlights shows for Canadian audiences (while still carrying ESPN/CBS coverage for the tournament itself).|$|E

5|$|In Tulsa, the Creek Turnpike has an {{interchange}} at Memorial Drive, <b>which</b> <b>carries</b> US-64 {{south of}} the toll road. At this interchange, Creek Turnpike traffic merges with northbound US-64 onto a free road, forming the Mingo Valley Expressway.

As the Mingo Valley Expressway (carrying US-64/US-169) turns north, the Creek Turnpike exits to continue southeast. The highway leaves Tulsa, entering Broken Arrow, where it crosses over Haikey Creek. The turnpike passes through the second toll plaza, then turns back east.|$|E

Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (43combinations). These encode the twenty standard amino acids, giving most amino acids more than one possible codon.
