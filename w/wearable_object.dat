40|$|This thesis investigates and articulates {{an ethical}} Maori {{framework}} for New Zealand contemporary jewellery practice {{that represents a}} distinctive method of making, and thinking, unique to Te Waipounamu/Aotearoa New Zealand. Contemporary jewellery is an international applied art genre that self-consciously investigates the <b>wearable</b> <b>object</b> and the body as a site of reference, including related social contexts, such as ideas of preciousness, memento and heirloom. Currently a comprehensive analysis of contemporary jewellery practice embedded in whakapapa from Te Waipounamu/Aotearoa does not exist, and this thesis explores the implications of thinking about contemporary jewellery practice from a Kai Tahu, and Maori perspective through a taoka methodology. The metaphor of pepeha allows contemporary jewellery to be located within a Maori social context and a uniquely Maori system of knowing, by contextualising taoka/contemporary jewellery alongside oral narrative as statements of collective identity anchored in Te Ao Kai Tahu (a Kai Tahu worldview).

40|$|Wearable Metal Origami” is a {{research}} leading to a collection of <b>wearable</b> <b>objects,</b> made from metallised folding textile. The research engages with current concerns in industrialised society, where new materials and innovative products are in demand. The material I have developed is influenced by historical and contemporary jewellery and clothing {{as well as by}} deployable structures; folding patterns are based on folding patterns in nature and on the knowledge of origami mathematicians; production processes include traditional printing and jewellery techniques. Bridging all these disciplines, the outcome is a novel material {{that could be used in}} various design fields but is particularly relevant to jewellery for its striking visual character, its flexible movement which easily adjusts to the human body, and the possibility to use precious metals. I based my research in the department of Goldsmithing, Silversmithing, Metalwork and Jewellery because this department had helped me develop the initial material during my MA course, so I knew it could provide me with the necessary equipment and support in designing wearable pieces. My project was finally conducted within a departmental team research project (Deployable Adaptive Structures) in which my colleagues investigated the broader application of metallised or otherwise tessellated folded textile in such fields as interior architecture, sunscreens and water sculptures, and ways of actuating the material either virtually or by mechanical means. ““Wearable Metal Origami”?” is based on MA project work, where I had used one folding pattern and found one production method. I strongly believed that this material would be ideal for the creation of jewellery and larger <b>wearable</b> <b>objects</b> if I could expand the range of flexibly moving patterns, improve the production process of the material and develop appropriate design processes. My research set out to fulfil these requirements and prove the value of the material in the context of metalwork and jewellery and the applied arts. To expand the range of folding patterns I collected and analysed existing tessellating origami patterns. With this knowledge I created my own variations. All patterns were evaluated on their suitability for “Wearable Metal Origami” and a basic classification was made, based on their folding properties. A small selection of patterns was then tested to get an understanding of the influence of plate thickness, hinge width and hinge flexibility by making card-textile and plywood-textile models. I developed and tested new processes for the production of the metallised folding textile. These included preparatory processes (before electroforming), electroforming and various ways of treating the material after electroforming. Each process was evaluated on its practicality. To develop appropriate design processes for <b>wearable</b> <b>objects</b> of Metallised Folding Textile I ran four case studies, each with its own design brief. I set the briefs in such a way that they addressed different parts of the body and different qualities of the material, such as changing shape and flexibility. For each application an origami pattern was chosen and adjusted through a process of trial and error until it had the correct proportions and movement...|$|R

50|$|PixMob {{technology}} uses infrared {{to light}} up RGB LEDs that are embedded in different objects such as balls or wristbands. These <b>wearable</b> <b>objects</b> are given to an audience, transforming each individual into a pixel during the show. To light up each pixel (i.e. each LED), commands are sent from computers to transmitters that emit invisible light (infrared). The infrared signal is picked up by infrared receivers in each object and goes through a tiny 8-bit microprocessor {{to light up}} the LEDs. The type of transmitter involved differs depending of the version of the technology chosen. Wash fixtures or lekos, typically seen in the live entertainment industry, are usually used. For the PixMob video technology, VT transmitters beam video instructions onto the audience, almost like a matrix creating a virtual map. With this technology, the infrared receiver decodes the signal differently depending on each pixel/person’s location. This enables the creation of animated video effects and transforms the audience into a display screen. Despite the low-resolution result due to a low number of pixels, quite detailed video effects can be achieved on a large canvas, using bright colors and bold movements.|$|R

40|$|This practice-led {{research}} project investigates visual representations of female sexual identity within Western popular culture. It draws {{on a broad}} range of sources including historical research of feminism and feminist theory, art and design, clothing and fetish, social media, film and television, advertising and the music industry. It examines and responds to persistent cultural stereotypes regarding female desire, focussing on the role of materials that accompany and embellish sexual narratives. The project seeks to expand the ways that normative signifiers of sexuality can be interpreted. This is examined and tested in a series of artworks that consider the relationships between sexualised bodies and materials. The creative outcomes include sculpture, photography, performance and <b>wearable</b> <b>objects.</b> Through heuristic and embodied making processes, the project reveals the ways in which materials can be appropriated to expand representations of female sexual and sexualised subjectivity. The signifying potential of these materials was enhanced and modulated through the use of humour, framing and paradox within the creative outcomes.

40|$|In this {{research}} project, we present {{an alternative approach}} to recognize various walking-based activities based on the technology of capacitive sensing. While accelerometry-based walking detections suffer from reduced accuracy at low speeds, the technology of capacitive sensing uses physical distance parameters, which makes it invariant to the duration of step performance. Determining accurate levels of walking activity is a crucial factor for people who perform walking with tiny step lengths such as elderlies or patients with pathologic conditions. In contrast to other gait analysis solutions, CapWalk is mobile and less affected by external influences such as bad lighting conditions, while it is also invariant to external acceleration artifacts. Our approach enables a reliable recognition of very slow walking speeds, in which accelerometer-based implementations can fail or provide high deviations. In CapWalk we present three different capacitive sensing prototypes (Leg Band, Chest Band, Insole) in the setup of loading mode to demonstrate recognition of sneaking, normal walking, fast walking, jogging, and walking while carrying weight. Our designs are wearable and could easily be integrated into <b>wearable</b> <b>objects,</b> such as shoes, pants or jackets.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} assumed {{affordance}} of haptic technology in a wearable context. This work position itself within the {{internet of things}} where <b>wearable</b> and connected <b>objects</b> have established themselves as a sub-domain in the area. Some argued that haptic technologies provide certain benefits when creating interfaces for wearable technologies. However, their seams to be a lack of studies investigating the natural responses to haptic technology from a user perspective. To investigate the assumed benefits of haptic technology, we have developed a prototype of a wearable haptic system. This system consists of two jacket were each jacket contains 16 touch sensitive sensor and haptic actuators. All interactions with the sensor of one jacket are mirrored with a haptic feedback in the other jacket. The purpose of this system is to investigate the initial responses and accord of haptic technology by users. The reason for doing this is to develop guidelines for further investigation into haptic technology as a means for creating <b>wearable</b> <b>objects</b> with a non-screen based interfaces. The study concludes there to be some merit to the use of rhythm for creating haptic interaction patterns as well as haptic technology affording a simple and natural dialog in human computer interaction. Further, we also conclude that there is some merit to haptic affording faster learning curves in novel non-screen based interaction and are suitable for providing clear feedback. This study also shows limitations for haptic technology. Haptics seem less proficient for interfaces existing in a system as well as handling errors. This study also proved problematic because of the lack in clearly defined methods for investigating novel non-screen based interfaces. In chapter two of this thesis we first present a theoretical overview of wearable’s generally and how haptic technology position itself within wearable technology. In chapter three, we move on by introducing our methods of research. Based on our theory we then frame the technological outline of the project and practical implementation. We follow this by presenting the results in chapter five from our user testing conducted with the prototype.

40|$|Special {{thanks to}} the {{participants}} providing the data collectionBy combining embedded passive sensing technologies from both smartphone and smartwatch, {{it is possible to}} obtain a high quality detection of sedentary activities (sitting, reclining posture [...] .), movements (walking [...] .) and periods of more intense body movements (running [...] .). Our research encompasses the definition of an energy-saving function for the total energy expenditure (TEE) estimation using accelerometry data. This topic is clearly at the crossroad of both computer science and medical research. The present contribution proposes an intelligent wearable system, which combines the use of two complementary devices: smartphone and smartwatch to collect accelerometry data. Together they can precisely discriminate real-world human sedentary and active behaviors and their duration and estimate energy expenditure in real time and in free-living conditions. The results of the study are expected to help subjects to handle their daily-living physical activity notably for being compliant with the physical activity international guidelines (150 min of moderate intensity activity/week). It is also expected that the physical activity feedbacks using these popular devices can prove the effectiveness of such <b>wearable</b> <b>objects</b> to promote individually-adapted healthy behavioral changes. The performance of the proposed function was evaluated by comparing the energy expenditure given by the smartphone and smartwatch with that produced by Armband. The mean error of TEE between the proposed function and Armband was less than 4 % for an average 6 h period of daily-living activities. The main theoretical contribution is the definition of a new predictive mathematical function of energy expenditure, which competes with the non-public function used in dedicated costly devices such as Armband.

One of {{the aims of the}} project was to utilise the collections and expertise available across three Middlesbrough museums: mima, The Dorman Museum and the Captain Cook Birthplace Museum. Together with local Middlesbrough residents, we used the museum collections as a means to explore issues around commissioning contemporary craft. Essentially we were commissioned by the museum, to produce commissions for local residents, with the resulting objects being made twice: one piece was for the resident to keep, and one was to be housed within mima’s contemporary jewellery collection. There were a number of stages to our project, which we called Pas de deux. First we delivered participatory workshops at mima, where local residents were asked to draw, describe and model an object from memory. We then made castings from these sketches using cuttlefish moulds and pewter. After the workshops Lin and I selected two people to work with, and these became our local commissioners. The third piece was made for all of the workshop participants rather than for an individual. We interviewed our commissioners about a range of subjects, including their own lives and likes, and used the extensive jewellery collection at mima as the basis for discussions around contemporary <b>wearable</b> <b>objects.</b> Our commissioners also investigated The Dorman and Cook Museums, and highlighted objects within the collections that intrigued or engaged them.
