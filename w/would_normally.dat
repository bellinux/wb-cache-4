5|$|Blake v Barnard {{established}} {{a rule that}} conditional threats could not amount to an assault. However, the court's reliance on Tuberville v Savage was tenuous at best. Such threats <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> be considered assault.|$|E
5|$|Elves are {{naturally}} immortal, and remain unwearied with age. In {{addition to their}} immortality, Elves can recover from wounds which <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> kill a mortal Man. However, Elves can be slain, or die of grief and weariness.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Schumacher and Williams driver David Coulthard were disqualified {{for fuel}} irregularities, after a switch to Renault engines and Elf oils. On appeal, both drivers had their results and points reinstated, but both teams lost the points the results <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> have earned in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E

5|$|In this {{flat and}} marshy area, the {{branches}} and roots of mangrove trees form dams where deposits of oyster shells naturally accumulate along with mud and plant detritus. These tangles help retain soil, {{a process which}} expands the island where the power of tidal race <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> have the opposite effect.|$|E
5|$|On 5 December 1854, citing ill-health, Cardigan {{set off for}} England. In these circumstances, {{the word}} of an officer {{regarding}} his fitness to serve <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> be accepted, but Raglan permitted his departure only after a medical board had confirmed his claimed disability.|$|E
5|$|On May 20, 2012, Perl 5.16 was released. Notable new {{features}} include {{the ability to}} specify a given version of Perl that one wishes to emulate, allowing users to upgrade their version of Perl, but still run old scripts that <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> be incompatible. Perl 5.16 also updates the core to support Unicode 6.1.|$|E

5|$|Several {{animal species}} have been {{introduced}} to Everglades waterways. Many tropical fish are released, the most detrimental being the blue tilapia (Oreochromis aureus), which builds large nests in shallow waters. Tilapia also consume vegetation which <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> be used by young native fishes for cover and protection.|$|E
5|$|The HEADING mode of the {{autopilot}} <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> be engaged sometime after takeoff {{to comply with}} vectors from ATC, and then after receiving appropriate ATC clearance, to guide the plane to intercept the desired INS course line.|$|E
5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. The crew <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> start decompression {{as soon as possible}} after launching.|$|E

5|$|After Foliot's failed {{candidacy}} as bishop, in February 1216 John {{appointed him}} to the benefice of Colwall in Herefordshire, the king having {{the ability to make}} the appointment because Giles de Braose, the Bishop of Hereford, who <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> have made the appointment, had recently died. Also from this time comes Foliot's patronage of Robert Grosseteste, the theologian and future Bishop of Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the film, Arroway is {{put into}} a {{position}} that she had traditionally viewed with skepticism and contempt: that of believing something with complete certainty, despite being unable to prove it in the face of not only widespread incredulity and skepticism (which she admits that as a scientist she <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> share) but also evidence apparently to the contrary.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{worsening}} kidney damage <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> {{prompt a}} kidney biopsy. Treatment may be indicated {{on the basis}} of the appearance of the biopsy sample; various treatments may be used, ranging from oral steroids to a combination of intravenous methylprednisolone (steroid), cyclophosphamide and dipyridamole followed by prednisone. Other regimens include steroids/azathioprine, and steroids/cyclophosphamide (with or without heparin and warfarin). Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is occasionally used.|$|E

5|$|Fingerspelling {{is a form}} of borrowing, a {{linguistic}} process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another. In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native ASL equivalent. There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either very short English words or abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. O-N from English 'on', and A-P-T from English 'apartment'. Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> be signed otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Bean {{often seems}} unaware of basic {{aspects of the}} way the world works, and the {{programme}} usually features his attempts at what <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> be considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, interior decorating, or going to church. The humour largely comes from his original (and often absurd) solutions to problems and his total disregard for others when solving them, his pettiness, and occasional malevolence.|$|E
5|$|Persistent {{attempts}} by the Israeli government to identify another Palestinian leader to represent the Palestinian people failed. Arafat was enjoying the support of groups that, given his own history, <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> have been quite wary of dealing with or supporting him. Marwan Barghouti (a leader of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades) emerged as a possible replacement during the Second Intifada, but Israel had him arrested for allegedly {{being involved in the}} killing of twenty-six civilians, and he was sentenced to five life terms.|$|E

50|$|A pre-unit {{motorcycle}} <b>would</b> not <b>normally</b> {{be able to}} use {{the engine}} as part of the frame as a stressed member, since the engine/primary-chaincase/gearbox assembly would not be sufficiently rigid.|$|R
5|$|The {{main belt}} armour <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> taper {{to a lesser}} {{thickness}} {{along the side of}} the hull towards bow and stern; it might also taper up from the central citadel towards the superstructure. The deck was typically lightly armoured with 2 to 4inches of steel. This lighter armour was to prevent high-explosive shells from wrecking the superstructure of the ship.|$|E
5|$|The oil {{terminal}} supplied 30% of Heathrow Airport's fuel, {{and because}} of the fire, the airport had to start rationing fuel. Some long-haul flights to Australia, the Far East, and South Africa had to make an intermediate stop at Stansted Airport or other European airports to refuel, while short-haul operators were asked to fuel their aircraft for the round trip before flying to Heathrow. Some aircraft were only allowed 40% of the fuel they <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> take on board. Fuel shortages continued for months after the explosion.|$|E
5|$|The unusually low {{metallicity}} of Vega {{makes it}} a weak Lambda Boötis-type star. However, {{the reason for the}} existence of such chemically peculiar, spectral class A0-F0 stars remains unclear. One possibility is that the chemical peculiarity {{may be the result of}} diffusion or mass loss, although stellar models show that this <b>would</b> <b>normally</b> only occur near the end of a star's hydrogen-burning lifespan. Another possibility is that the star formed from an interstellar medium of gas and dust that was unusually metal-poor.|$|E
50|$|In the 19th century, {{financier}} Russell Sage used put-call parity {{to create}} synthetic loans, which had {{higher interest rates}} than the usury laws of the time <b>would</b> have <b>normally</b> allowed.|$|R
