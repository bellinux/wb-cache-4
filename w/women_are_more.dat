5|$|<b>Women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> {{prone to}} UTIs than men because, in females, the urethra is much shorter {{and closer to}} the anus. As a woman's {{estrogen}} levels decrease with menopause, her risk of urinary tract infections increases due to the loss of protective vaginal flora. Additionally, vaginal atrophy that can sometimes occur after menopause is associated with recurrent urinary tract infections.|$|E

5|$|<b>Women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> {{likely to}} develop {{hypothyroidism}} than men. In population-based studies, women were seven {{times more likely than}} men to have TSH levels above 10 mU/l. 2–4% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism each year. The risk is higher in those with antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to affect approximately 2% of children; in adults, subclinical hypothyroidism is more common in the elderly, and in Caucasians. There is a much higher rate of thyroid disorders, the most common of which is hypothyroidism, in individuals with Down syndrome and Turner syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to several}} {{successful}} {{television and radio}} campaigns by the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations in Malawi, levels of awareness regarding HIV/AIDS are high among the general population. However, many men have adopted fatalistic attitudes {{in response to the}} epidemic, convincing themselves that death from AIDS is inevitable; on the other hand, some have implemented preventative techniques such as partner selection to try to reduce their risk of infection. Although many women have developed strategies to protect themselves from HIV, <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to be HIV-positive than men in Malawi. The epidemic has affected sexual relationships between partners, who must cooperate to protect themselves from the disease. In addition, many teachers exclude HIV/AIDS from their curricula because they are uncomfortable discussing the topic or because they do not feel knowledgeable about the issue, and, therefore, many children are not exposed to information about HIV/AIDS at school. Finally, the epidemic has produced significant numbers of orphans in Malawi, leaving children vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local health facilities or during conversations with friends or family members, {{people are more likely}} to address the risk of HIV contraction with their spouses. In addition, <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely than men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that their spouses are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E

5|$|The {{primary risk}} factor for COPD {{globally}} is tobacco smoking. Of those who smoke about 20% will get COPD, and {{of those who are}} lifelong smokers about half will get COPD. In the United States and United Kingdom, of those with COPD, 80–95% are either current smokers or previously smoked. The likelihood of developing COPD increases with the total smoke exposure. Additionally, <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> susceptible to the harmful effects of smoke than men. In non-smokers, secondhand smoke is the cause of about 20% of cases. Other types of smoke, such as, marijuana, cigar, and water pipe smoke, also confer a risk. Water pipe smoke appears to be as harmful as smoking cigarettes. Problems from marijuana smoke may only be with heavy use. Women who smoke during pregnancy may increase the risk of COPD in their child. For the same amount of cigarette smoking, women have a higher risk of COPD than men.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholism, {{also known}} as alcohol use {{disorder}} (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when {{two or more of}} the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{societal}} pressures that combine {{to create the}} double burden, including some economic thinking of domestic work, thoughts about net household gain, and the perceived notion that <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to ask for maternity leave than men. Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation. They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive, and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers. There is also {{the notion that the}} net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor. This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs, creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled. In addition, women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men, meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job, which has negative effects on female employment.|$|E

Demographic characteristics were similar, although males <b>were</b> <b>more</b> like to identify as gay or bisexual, and <b>women</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> likely to <b>be</b> of minority ethnicity.

50|$|The first approach, “individual determinants”, {{stems from}} the {{psychological}} perspective of rape.

25|$|Shrout’s study {{concluded}} that women who experienced negative appraisals, like self-blame and causal attribution, led to emotional distress and increased health-compromising behavior (Shrout, 2017). Studies show that men typically only experience distress from a physical or sexual affair, while <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> bothered by emotional or relational affairs. However, <b>women</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> affected than men. This is due perception (Shrout, 2017). Women perceive relationships {{as more of a}} priority and are usually more emotionally attached (Palermo, 2015). Following a study of coping differences between genders, Binghamton University and University College London researchers say it’s evolutionary and we can blame our ancestors for this.|$|E
