Subsequently, in October 2003, the central {{government}} decided that state-owned enterprises had {{to be separated from}} Ministries and/or provincial governments and had to be commercialized. Competitive bidding for contracts, private sector participation and commercial financing are important element in the transition to a market economy. In the 1990s, the first BOT contracts were signed for wastewater treatment plants. More than 200 wastewater treatment plants were built with some form of private sector participation in their financing and/or management, usually using the BOT formula. Early BOTs saw governments implementing the process without the benefit of financial, legal, and technical advisers, finding to their chagrin that the process becomes more complex in the absence of expert knowledge. Learning from the experience of past BOTs in the sector, local governments sought expert advice on bidding and public tender. In about 2000 for the first time, a BOT water project (Chengdu No. 6 <b>Water</b> <b>Supply</b> <b>Plant)</b> was awarded on the basis of transparent international competitive bidding, with support from the ADB. In 2004, a landmark international competitive bid for the entire water supply and sanitation system of Shenzhen was won by a joint venture including the French firm Veolia.|$|E

This study proposes a stochastic model of the probable maximum simultaneous water demands of domestic washrooms at some usage patterns for which the appliances in the same washroom would not operate simultaneously. The model parameters were determined from surveys of usage patterns in 597 domestic washrooms of typical high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong. The {{results showed that the}} probable maximum simultaneous demands due to a number of domestic washrooms in a typical high-rise residential building were only about 50 - 60 % of those estimates with an assumption of all appliances in simultaneous operation.

40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of probable maximum simultaneous demand {{are essential for}} sizing the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>plants</b> and piping systems of high-rise residential buildings cost-effectively and eco-efficiently. This paper surveyed the water usage patterns through face-to-face interviews and simple on site measurements from some typical high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong and investigated the probable maximum demands of domestic appliances in terms of fixture units determined at an allowable failure rate of 1 % of the peak hourly demands. The fixture units of a WC, a washbasin, a shower, a kitchen sink and a 5 L washing machine were quantified and compared with the current design values.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the probable maximum simultaneous demands of <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> facilities at {{an acceptable level}} of reliability for some high-rise residential buildings in crowded cities. In particular, the probable maximum simultaneous water demands of domestic washrooms are derived for some usage patterns that the appliances in the same washroom would not operate simultaneously. The model parameters including usage patterns and operating flow rates of some domestic appliances were surveyed from 597 domestic washrooms of 14 typical high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong. The results revealed that, with the surveyed data and original design data as references, the probable maximum simultaneous demands were only about 50 % of those estimated for assuming all appliances in simultaneous operation. The results would be useful in updating the calculation of <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>plants</b> and piping systems for high-rise residential buildings at a balance of cost and system reliability.

Study indicates that Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis is being increasingly applied in the design of centrifugal pumps. With the aid of the CFD approach, the complex internal flows in water pump impellers, can be well predicted, to speed up the pump design procedure. This paper exposes the various research work carried out in this direction especially in the content of parametric study and optimization of centrifugal pump impeller using CFD tool and DoE technique.
