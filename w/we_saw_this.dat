5|$|That day we saw horror, but we {{also saw}} quiet acts of courage. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> courage in a teacher named Liviu Librescu. With the gunman set to enter his class, this brave {{professor}} blocked the door with his body while his students fled to safety. On the Day of Remembrance, this Holocaust survivor gave his own life so that others may live. And this morning we honor his memory and we take strength from his example.|$|E
25|$|When we {{point out}} the need of {{opposing}} Trotskyism we discover a very strange phenomenon, that voices are raised in its defense {{in the ranks of}} certain organizations and among certain circles in certain parties. These voices belong to people who themselves are intoxicated with this counter-revolutionary ideology. The Trotskyists have long been transformed into the agents of Fascism, into the agents of the German Gestapo. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> on the ground during the May putsch in Catalonia; <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> clearly in the disturbances that occurred in various other places. And everybody will realize this when the trial opens against the P.O.U.M. leaders who were caught spying. And we realize that the hand of Fascism is behind every attempt to demoralize our home front, to undermine the authority of the Republic. Therefore it is essential that we wipe out Trotskyism with a firm hand, for Trotskyism is no longer a political option for the working class but an instrument of the counter-revolution.|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} [...] "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs" [...] aired, {{members of the}} Kardashian family responded {{positively}} to their portrayal and on-screen deaths. On her blog, Kim Kardashian wrote that the family found the episode very funny and were honored to be featured in the episode. She wrote, [...] "We were all dying when <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> clip from South Park that aired last night... literally, LOL. They killed us all!!!" [...] She also wrote, [...] "I managed to survive the longest... of course!" [...] Kourtney Kardashian joked on her Twitter page, [...] "How rude! Southpark!!", Khloé Kardashian wrote {{she did not know}} about her appearance on the show until she suddenly received numerous messages on her Twitter page. Khloé also said she found the scene funny, and laughed at how unattractively she and her sisters were portrayed, although she said the Bruce Jenner cartoon looked very realistic. She wrote, [...] "Even though we all weren't portrayed as the most attractive South Park characters, I was still so flattered since I love that show haha." ...|$|E

500|$|Several gaming and {{technology}} sites reported an [...] "overheating bug" [...] with StarCraft II {{that in some}} cases resulted in permanent damage to video cards. The source of the problem {{is the fact that the}} frame rate is not locked on menu screens. This causes the graphics card to continuously render the image, resulting in excessive heat. Blizzard has acknowledged the problem, and posted a temporary workaround. [...] They also recommended ensuring computer systems are well ventilated and contacting the videocard manufacturer for hardware-related issues. In response to the reports, Blizzard's Public Relations Manager, Bob Colayco said: [...] "There is no code in our software that will cause video cards to overheat. When <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> issue first reported, we conducted thorough additional testing and determined that for those players experiencing this problem, the cause is most likely hardware-related." [...] CrunchGear has also suggested that the problem is not with StarCraft II, but rather due to poorly maintained hardware and inadequate cooling. They do however agree that the overheating only occurs on non-framerate locked screens and provide the fix that Blizzard has offered to users. [...] Other articles recommend that users regularly clean the dust out of their computer to improve the cooling efficiency of their systems. Blizzard posted a message on their forums regarding the issue that has since been removed. The message was: [...] "Screens that are light on detail may make your system overheat if cooling is overall insufficient. This is because the game has nothing to do so it is primarily just working on drawing the screen very quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} positively by reviewers {{of the trade}} publications. A very positive review by Walton of The Moving Picture News states, [...] " [...] tale of deep, sterling, human interest. The whole plot is so simple, so refreshingly lucid and pure. We cannot criticize this film {{any more than a}} man could analyze mother love. There is a tenderness - and pathos - that is as a nimbus to the whole. The acting of the blind girl, natural, and exquisite, and of her little sister is sweetly innocent. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> film twice, on the day of release, in different theatres, and in each case large audiences were touched - and also highly amused by the little girl in the carriage. A sweeter, purer, human-interest tale has not been put on the curtain. The prayer scene deserves to be limned by a master hands that lesson to our children's children. Had we space we could tell the comments of men and women on this production. One thing may be said and that is, all saw and realized the pathos, the beauty and the triumph of the work. Had the film been acted in a theatre we feel certain the audience, with ourselves, with one acclaim would have declared these two orphan girls as manifestations, in the hour of need, of the highest and best emotions of the race!" [...] The Moving Picture Worlds reviewer was also positive and concluded that, [...] "Such films are helpful because they make nearly despairing men sometimes hopeful, and as long as hope lasts there is opportunity for achievement." [...] Even the reviewer of The New York Dramatic Mirror offered praise for Marie Eline's acting ability in particular, but found no fault with the production itself. Bowers notes that the Mirror was not without its detractors and was accused of being a tool of the Edison Trust companies, but reviews for Thanhouser films were amongst the most perceptive.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} half, Wakefield kicked a 27-yard field goal. [...] Two forward passes help Vanderbilt reach the spot. Later, McKibbon threw a pass which gained 18 yards, and then threw {{another one of}} 10 yards, to Reese, who ran in the score. [...] "It was the best coached team <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> year," [...] said the Minnesota newspapermen.

5000|$|We {{will never}} forget them, nor the last time <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> them, <b>this</b> morning, as they {{prepared}} for their journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of Earth' to 'touch the face of God.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{numbers of}} this kind of {{creature}} that are in those parts are inconceivable, as may be gathered from the prodigious quantity of teeth which, as I said, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>this</b> vast desert; and indeed <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> a hundred of them to one of any other kind.|$|R

2500|$|In 2013, Jesse Katz, {{a former}} Los Angeles Times reporter, {{said of the}} LA Times coverage: [...] "As an L.A. Times reporter, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> series in the San Jose Mercury News and kind of wonder how legit it was and kind of put it under a microscope, {{and we did it}} in a way that most of us who were {{involved}} in it, I think, would look back on that and say it was overkill. We had this huge team of people at the L.A. Times and kind of piled on to one lone muckraker up in Northern California." [...] And [...] "we really didn't do anything to advance his work or illuminate much to the story, and it was a really kind of tawdry exercise. ... And it ruined that reporter's career." ...|$|E

25|$|Naive {{set theory}} interprets Boolean {{operations}} as acting on subsets {{of a given}} set X. As <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> earlier <b>this</b> behavior exactly parallels the coordinate-wise combinations of bit vectors, with the union of two sets corresponding to the disjunction of two bit vectors and so on.|$|R
50|$|Restrictive: <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> two puppies <b>this</b> morning: {{one that}} was born {{yesterday}} and {{one that was}} born last week. The one that (or which*) was born yesterday is tiny.|$|R
6000|$|When <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this,</b> we hesitated. Could we ask a man {{who owned}} books, and could {{probably}} read, to play second fiddle {{to a woman who}} could not speak the English language, and who for years, perhaps, had devoted the energies of her soul to the sale of pepper-pods? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The same <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> afternoon," [...] whispered Shirley. [...] "They {{have been}} halting somewhere till now.

Did I not say we should see unusual things ere long?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was fully}} noon before we saw another sail.

6000|$|Now on {{no known}} Ruthven seal, as <b>we</b> <b>saw,</b> does <b>this</b> figure appear, {{not even on}} a seal of Gowrie himself, used in 1597. Thus it is perhaps not too daring to suppose that Gowrie, when in Italy in 1597, added this emblematic figure to his ancestral bearings. What does the figure symbolise? ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{once more}} she saluted and went, leaving us wondering, for <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>this</b> woman was not {{altogether}} as other Kaffirs are, {{and it came}} into our minds that {{in the time of}} need she would be as is a sharp spear in the hand of one who is beset with foes.|$|R
30|$|This may be {{illustrated}} by subgraph 11, {{which has been}} shown to be overrepresented in many biological neural networks (Sporns 2010). This subgraph contains a hub structure as well as two chain structures. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>this</b> work that this subgraph was involved in more significant transformations than any other subgraph and thus was more influential over functional reconstruction.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{always wanted}} to tatch a whale, {{and this is a}} baby one, I fink.

60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> in the army, 'twas {{time to look}} about.

6000|$|Instantly we saw {{the body}} of men that had been {{appointed}} to this service move forward toward {{a point where the}} concentrated fire of our guns had crumbled the upper half of a broad stretch of wall to ruins; <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> force descend into the ditch and begin to plant the scaling-ladders. We were soon with them. The Lieutenant-General thought the assault premature. But Joan said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'At the photographer's, at {{the time}} he was at Hiltonbury,' said Phoebe. 'I went to him with one of my sisters, and we were amused by finding many of the likenesses of our servants.

25|$|Public Opinion {{about the}} Vietnam War {{continually}} went {{down as the}} war dragged on.

5000|$|The {{number of}} {{representations}} of an integer n by a form f is finite if f is definite and infinite if f is indefinite. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> instances of <b>this</b> in the examples above: [...] is positive definite and [...] is indefinite.|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> bear walk along, poke around, {{dig into}} the ground, go behind trees, come out again, and finally stand up on his hind feet and {{apparently}} reach for berries or something on a bush.

6000|$|... "Aye, he knew {{as soon as}} <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>this</b> grave mound. But Steinar {{was telling}} me that some ghost haunts it, and I begged him to stay awhile, since there is nothing I desire so much as to see a ghost, who believe little in such things. So he stayed, though he says he fears the dead more than the living. Freydisa, {{they tell me that}} you are very wise. Cannot you show me this ghost?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Audree Wilson {{continues}} {{that she}} and her husband, Murry Wilson, [...] "barely got in the door, and they said, 'We've got something to play for you.'

30|$|Overall, Scenario 1 {{performed}} with the highest amount of accuracy (3.72  mm, 0.33 %, and 1.89  mm) and then Scenario 6 (5.69  mm, 0.49 %, and 2.73  mm) and Scenario 5 (5.69  mm, 0.49 %, and 2.74  mm). The prevailing patterns that <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> throughout <b>this</b> model were Scenario 2 performed best on the left side, Scenario 3 performed best on the right side, Scenario 5 and 6 had nearly identical results, and on average Scenario 1 performed had the best results.|$|R
6000|$|Though {{lying there}} alone, the poor creetur was as well {{taken care of}} as could be hoped, and would have been quite {{unconscious}} of any one's sitting by him then.
