Webs containing five different blends were prepared by either light needlepunching, or light needlepunching followed by hydroentangling. We acquired detailed basis weight uniformity measurements {{to learn about}} processing {{and the influence of}} fiber blend composition on web uniformity. Basis weight uniformity was evaluated without regard to <b>web</b> <b>direction</b> ("Total" uniformity), along the machine direction (MD uniformity) and across the cross direction (CD uniformity) at numerous size resolutions. We observed that blending manufactured fibers (either Tencel or olefin/polyester) with bleached cotton and comber noils substantially improved basis weight uniformity of both types of nonwovens.

40|$|Industries {{nowadays}} demand {{lightweight and}} space-saving solutions such as sandwich panels that offer high strength-to-weight ratios. In general, sandwich panels consist of homogeneous core material that carries a shear force and face plates that carry a bending moment. The web-core sandwich panel has an inhomogeneous core as {{it consists of}} unidirectional web plates that are periodically distributed and connected to the face plates by laser stake-welded T-joints. The joint has two crack-like notches {{on each side of}} the weld. When the panel bends, the out-of-plane shear deformation opposite to the <b>web</b> <b>direction</b> causes local bending of the joined plates in the vicinity of the weld. This leads to tension at one notch tip and compression at the other. The fatigue crack initiates at the tensile tip and propagates through the weld under cyclic loading until the plates are separated and the sandwich effect is lost. The thesis investigates the fatigue resistance of laser stake-welded T-joints in the web-core panels under out-of-plane loading, i. e. lateral loading. The bending of the joined plates in panels can cause contact between the surfaces of the compressive notch. It is determined that the contact causes an increase of the stiffness of the T-joint in the case of significant face plate deflection since it results in a large rotation of the joint. The increase in the stiffness of the joint needs to be considered in the assessment of the global response of the panel, which defines the displacements that are imposed as the loads in the local strength assessment of the joint. If panel contains a low-stiffness filling material inside the voids, the contribution of the material increases the shear stiffness of the panel and reduces the deformation of the joint. Thus, under the same external loading, the filling prolongs the fatigue life of the panel. The evaluation of the J-integral at the tips of the notches, modelled using statistically mean notch depth values, gave agreement on the fatigue strengths between all the series that were investigated at five million load cycles. The agreement is obtained regardless of plate thicknesses, the type of loading or whether the filling material is present. Good agreement with other steel joints is also demonstrated at five million load cycles. However, the slope of the fatigue resistance curve varies, depending mainly on the load type, i. e. tension or bending. The research determined that the slope depends on the distribution of the maximum principal stress in the vicinity of the notch tip. When the stress is characterized by a dimensionless gradient, evaluated in the stress direction, the slope-gradient relation appears linear. The gradient shows sensitivity towards the loading type and the plate thickness effect...|$|E

Curs: 2013 / 2014 In this Master thesis I {{will explain}} how {{companies}} can {{stay on the}} Internet {{and how they can}} offer their services and products on the internet using several tools and software system which are accessible to all and even, most of them are completely free. For this purpose, I will focus on the growing that this company Tecnica & Color can get through internet. I realised my internships for the Master Degree in English Language for international Trade in Tecnica & Color is located in Artana (Castellón). The market of this business is divided between domestic and international market and both of them have the same importance. This company was founded in 2010, so it is a young company that at the beginning it was located in Quart de Poblet (Valencia) but in 2012. The company moved its offices and warehouse to Artana. I was in the export department and I was in contact with all customers all over the world. When customers email us, I realized that in firm of their emails they always included their names, their position, contact and also their URL of their website. Despite the fact that we did not write our URL on the mail, it is printed in all documents that we sent to the customers. But if the customers click on this URL, the corporative <b>web</b> <b>direction</b> was not available. The message was work in progress. There is only one way in which people or future customers can know something about our company. It is when a customer had informed other people about the company because nobody can find this company on the internet. Without the presence of the internet, firm can find new customers through to the international fairs, the salesman or the various contacts that headquarter has had during last years. It could be a good option, maybe it is enough for some companies but I believe that if a company has a good website where it shows its products and its activity, it will have more impact on the chemical products field. For these reasons, I would propose a better use of the internet by developing a good marketing plan. Being the international market so important for a company, they can increase their presence on the internet and it will be developed with a marketing online plan. For this thesis, I will explain the different parts of the marketing online and thanks to the different information available in numerous projects, articles or books about this topic. This thesis has the following main point. Firstly, I will explain the correct meaning of marketing online and the parts that it is composed of. Moreover, I will show its importance in comparison with other kind of marketing strategy. Secondly, the different aspects and elements that companies can use in order to develop this marketing online, such as the creation of a company webpage, the importance of the social networks in order to find new people who know something about the company, then how companies can catch the attention of these new people through the creation of newsletter. All this information will be applied {{in the creation of a}} webpage and a newsletter system where I will put all knowledge about the marketing online and I will try to put all elements in order to be useful for the company that I have mentioned previously. This is my main purpose in this thesis, applying the theoretical knowledge in the creation of an online structure composed by a webpage, the presence of the company in the social network and the creation of newsletter in order to publish its products to the target market. 3.

40|$|Abstract: Enabled by the Internet-Web compound, co‑creation {{of value}} by {{consumers}} {{has emerged as}} a major force in the marketplace. In sponsored co‑creation, which takes place at the behest of producers, the activities of consumers drive or support the producers’ business models.

Thus, individuals and communities have become a significant, and growing, productive force in e‑commerce. To recognize co‑creation, so broadly understood, as a fundamental area of e‑commerce research, it is necessary to attain an integrated research perspective on this greatly varied, yet cohering, domain.

40|$|Groundwater/surface-water {{interaction}} is receiv¬ing increasing focus in Africa {{due to its}} importance to ecologic systems and sustainability. In South Africa's 1998 National Water Act (NWA), water-use licenses, including groundwater, are granted only after defining the Reserve, {{the amount of water}} needed to supply basic human needs and preserve some ecological integrity. Accurate quantification of groundwater con¬tributions to ecosystems for successful implementation of the NWA proves challenging; many of South Africa's aquifers are in heterogeneous and anisotropic fractured-rock settings. This paper reviews the current conceptualizations and investigative approaches regard¬ing groundwater/surface-water interactions in the con¬text of South African policies. Some selected pitfall experiences are emphasized. The most common approach in South Africa is estimation of average annual fluxes at the scale of fourth-order catchments (~ 500 km 2) with base flow separation techniques and then subtracting the groundwater discharge rate from the recharge rate. This approach might be a good start, but it ignores spatial and temporal variability, potentially missing local impacts associated with production-well placement.

The internal components of a semantic web are light weight and may be of less quality standards than the externally visible modules. In fact the internal components are generated from external (ontological) component. That is the reason agile development approaches such as feature driven development are suitable for applications internal component development. As yet there is no particular procedure that describes the role of ontology in the processes. Therefore we propose an ontology based feature driven development for semantic web application that can be used form application model development to feature design and implementation. Features are precisely defined in the OWL-based domain model. Transition from OWL based domain model to feature list is directly defined in transformation rules. On the other hand the ontology based overall model can be easily validated through automated tools. Advantages of ontology-based feature Driven development are also discussed.
