25|$|In general, the doses used {{recreational}}ly {{are between}} 0.5g and 3g. When {{used as a}} recreational drug, GHB may be found as the sodium or potassium salt, which is a <b>white</b> <b>crystalline</b> <b>powder,</b> or as GHB salt dissolved in water to form a clear solution. The sodium salt of GHB has a salty taste. Other salt forms such as calcium GHB and magnesium GHB have also been reported, but the sodium salt {{is by far the}} most common.|$|E
25|$|Under {{standard}} conditions, {{potassium bromide}} is a <b>white</b> <b>crystalline</b> <b>powder.</b> It is freely soluble in water; {{it is not}} soluble in acetonitrile. In a dilute aqueous solution, potassium bromide tastes sweet, at higher concentrations it tastes bitter, and tastes salty when the concentration is even higher. These effects are mainly due to {{the properties of the}} potassium ion—sodium bromide tastes salty at any concentration. In high concentration, potassium bromide strongly irritates the gastric mucous membrane, causing nausea and sometimes vomiting (a typical effect of all soluble potassium salts).|$|E
25|$|Acetone {{peroxide}} is {{an organic}} peroxide and a primary high explosive. It {{is produced by}} the oxidation of acetone to yield a mixture of linear monomer and cyclic dimer, trimer, and tetramer forms. The trimer is known as triacetone triperoxide (TATP) or tri-cyclic acetone peroxide (TCAP). Acetone peroxide {{takes the form of}} a <b>white</b> <b>crystalline</b> <b>powder</b> with a distinctive bleach-like odor and can explode if subjected to heat, friction, or shock. As a non-nitrogenous explosive, TATP has historically been more difficult to detect, and it has been used as an explosive in several terrorist attacks since 2001.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{reported}} {{that one of the}} 7 July suspects, Jamal (Germaine) Lindsay, had bought £900 worth of perfumes immediately before the bombings, possibly to disguise the acrid smell of the decomposing explosives.

2500|$|Aspartame was {{discovered}} in 1965 by James M. Schlatter at the G.D. Searle company. He was working on an anti-ulcer drug and accidentally spilled some aspartame on his hand. When he licked his finger, he noticed {{that it had a}} sweet taste. Torunn Atteraas Garin oversaw the development of aspartame as an artificial sweetener. It is an odorless, <b>white</b> <b>crystalline</b> <b>powder</b> that is derived from the two amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine. It is about 200 times as sweet as sugar and {{can be used as a}} tabletop sweetener or in frozen desserts, gelatins, beverages, and chewing gum. [...] When cooked or stored at high temperatures, aspartame breaks down into its constituent amino acids. [...] This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener. It is more stable in somewhat acidic conditions, such as in soft drinks. [...] Though it does not have a bitter aftertaste like saccharin, it may not taste exactly like sugar. When eaten, aspartame is metabolized into its original amino acids. [...] Because it is so intensely sweet, relatively little of it is needed to sweeten a food product, and is thus useful for reducing the number of calories in a product.|$|E
