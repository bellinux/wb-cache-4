50|$|Some systems, {{such as the}} PDP-10, use <b>word</b> <b>addressing</b> but {{facilitate}} {{access to}} individual bytes using special instructions which can access memory using a byte pointer, which contains both a <b>word</b> <b>address</b> and the index of a specific byte within the word.|$|R
5000|$|Two-bit {{character}} offset, seven-bit {{counter and}} 15-bit modifier (<b>word</b> <b>address).</b> The BCHX (branch on character indexing) instruction decremented {{the counter and}} incremented the character offset, incrementing the <b>word</b> <b>address</b> if the character offset overflowed, branching if the count had not reached zero.|$|R

30|$|Since many {{possible}} methods had been provided, confusion could arise due to individual systems, applications and manufacturers adopting the method which they favoured most {{for their own}} purposes. The RFC proposes to avoid this situation by permitting only one shortened IPv 6 <b>address</b> <b>format.</b> <b>Addresses</b> represented {{in any other way}} are not legitimate and therefore not permitted.|$|R
