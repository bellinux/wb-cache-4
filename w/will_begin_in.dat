5|$|First {{designated}} in 1972, Highway427 follows {{what was}} originally a two lane roadway known as Highway27, {{as well as}} a short freeway north of Highway401 known as the Airport Expressway. Both routes were upgraded throughout the 1950s and 1960s, eventually becoming intertwined into the present configuration in 1972. The freeway was extended north from Pearson Airport to Highway7 over the following twenty years. A short arterial extension was later built, though this section is designated as York Regional Road99 (Zenway Boulevard). Plans have been announced to extend Highway427 north to Major Mackenzie Drive; construction <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> <b>in</b> 2017 and is expected to be completed by 2020.|$|E

5|$|In 1922 Gaudí was commissioned, by the Franciscan Padre Angélico Aranda, to {{construct}} a church dedicated to the Assumption in the Chilean city of Rancagua. Gaudí apologised {{and said that he}} was occupied exclusively with the Sagrada Família, but sent some sketches of the Assumption chapel which he had designed for the apse of the Sagrada Família, which more or less coincided with what Padre Aranda had asked for. Unfortunately this project was not carried out, though there are currently plans by the Chilean architect Christian Matzner to take up the project. The President of Chile, Michelle Bachelet, has announced that building <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> <b>in</b> 2015, with an expected completion in 2017 and at a cost of $7million. Once completed it will become the first of Gaudí's works to be constructed in the Americas.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around a fictional conflict between the powers of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The player has the choice of choosing to control either NATO or Warsaw Pact forces {{at the beginning of}} the game. The player will begin the game on either side of Europe depending on which side was chosen; if NATO was picked, the player will start at western European countries (France, West Germany, Denmark) whereas if the player sides with the Warsaw Pact, the game <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> <b>in</b> eastern Europe. The map is hexagon-shaped and allows the player to move their units in six directions. Each side has a variety of units; infantry move at a slower pace than mechanised infantry however armoured units are able to withstand more damage than regular units. The game displays two maps on screen; the larger, central map displays the current situation whereas a smaller map to the corner of the screen displays a mini-map of Europe, which runs north from Denmark to southern France.|$|E
5|$|As of August 1, 2012, Fox was {{pursuing}} a sequel with Scott, Rapace, and Fassbender involved, and {{was talking to}} new writers in case Lindelof did not return. The film would be scheduled for a release no earlier than 2014. In December 2012, Lindelof {{had decided not to}} work on a sequel, citing other commitments. In June 2013, Jack Paglen was in negotiations to write the sequel. In October 2013, Scott confirmed that the script was complete, but in March 2014, Michael Green was hired to rewrite Paglen's script. In August 2015, it was announced that production for the film would begin in January 2016 with Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace reprising their roles, and Scott directing. While at the Toronto International Film Festival to promote his film The Martian, Scott stated that production on the film <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> <b>in</b> February 2016. In September 2015, Scott said that the title of the sequel will be Alien: Paradise Lost, an allusion to John Milton's epic poem which may also suggest a deeper connection with the Alien franchise. In an interview with Empire, Scott said that the title change did not affect the film's story and the film will have a connection to the character of Ellen Ripley.|$|E
