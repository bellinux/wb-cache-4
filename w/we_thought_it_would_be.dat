500|$|Hed PE {{signed with}} Jive Records, {{releasing}} their self-titled debut album in 1997. In {{his review of}} the album, Allmusic's Steve Huey wrote [...] "There are some slow and/or unfocused moments [...] but overall, its aggression will probably play well with late-'90s metal and punk fans." [...] Due to the label's contractual terms and the disappointing sales of the album, the band found themselves unable to repay the cash advances given to them by Jive. Gomes {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "We had these romantic visions of the music industry, and <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> cool to be a punk band on a rap label. So we fulfilled that dream, but it was also probably {{the worst thing that could}} have happened. [...] We've had offers from Sony and others that we can't take because we owe Jive so much money." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Vig, the {{inspiration}} for the song was a newspaper article about a woman who had gone back to get revenge on an abusive husband, [...] "so <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> cool to get a bit of retribution in there." [...] Vig also said he noted violence could also come from psychological stand point by seeing the story of a sado-masochistic couple who could not keep away from each other. Lyrically, Manson claimed [...] "'Vow' is about having feelings [...] You have to face your feelings of revenge and work out why you feel that way. It's about that conundrum when you're really angry but in reality you're in a pitiful state. Angry, twisted, but deep down, vulnerable." [...] During promotion for the song, Garbage joked to journalists that [...] "Vow" [...] was about John and Lorena Bobbitt.|$|E
500|$|Writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, who had {{previously}} co-written and starred in The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville, took inspiration for Inside No. 9 from [...] "David and Maureen", episode 4 of the first series of Psychoville, which was in turn inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. [...] "David and Maureen" [...] took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots. At the same time, the concept of Inside No. 9 was a [...] "reaction" [...] to Psychoville, with Shearsmith saying that [...] "we'd been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week. That's appealing, because as a viewer you might not like this story, but you've got a different one next week." [...] As an anthology series with horror themes, Inside No. 9 also pays homage to Tales of the Unexpected, The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents.|$|E
500|$|In 1967 {{during a}} meeting with Alejo Carpentier, Julio Cortázar, and Miguel Otero Silva, the Mexican author Carlos Fuentes {{launched}} a project consisting {{of a series of}} biographies depicting Latin American dictators, which was to be called Los Padres de la Patria (The Fathers of the Fatherland). After reading Edmund Wilson's portraits of the American Civil War in Patriotic Gore, Fuentes recounts, [...] "Sitting in a pub in Hampstead, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{a good idea to have}} a comparable book on Latin America. An imaginary portrait gallery immediately stepped forward, demanding incarnation: the Latin American dictators." [...] Vargas Llosa was to write about Manuel A. Odría, Jorge Edwards about José Manuel Balmaceda, José Donoso about Mariano Melgarejo, and Julio Cortázar about Eva Perón. As M. Mar Langa Pizarro observes, the project was never completed, but it helped inspire a series of novels written by important authors during the Latin American literary boom, such as Alejo Carpentier, Augusto Roa Bastos, Gabriel García Márquez, and Mario Vargas Llosa.|$|E

500|$|Pemberton and Shearsmith took {{inspiration}} for Inside No. 9 from [...] "David and Maureen", episode 4 {{of the first}} series of Psychoville, which was in turn inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's Rope. This episode took place entirely in a single room, and was filmed in only two shots. The writers were keen to explore other stories in this bottle episode or TV play format, and Inside No. 9 allowed them to do this. At the same time, the concept of Inside No. 9 was a [...] "reaction" [...] to Psychoville, with Shearsmith saying {{that the two of}} them had [...] "been so involved with labyrinthine over-arcing, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> nice to do six different stories with a complete new house of people each week. That's appealing, because as a viewer you might not like this story, but you've got a different one next week." [...] Elsewhere, Shearsmith explained that the pair returned to writing macabre stories as they [...] "always feel slightly unfulfilled if [...] write something that's purely comedic, [...] it just feels too frivolous and light". The first story that the pair wrote specifically for Inside No. 9 was about a birthday party. BBC producers felt that this story would work as the opening episode of a sitcom, but, given the script's events, Pemberton and Shearsmith were not happy to develop the idea into its own programme. The script was consequently shelved and revisited during the planning process for the second series, becoming [...] "Nana's Party", the fifth episode of the series and eleventh overall. During the filming Inside No. 9, Shearsmith professed excitement to be working on the programme, saying that [...] "eing in the middle of filming a third series of Psychoville would be utterly depressing". Pemberton and Shearsmith aimed for a simpler experience with Inside No. 9 than they had experienced with Psychoville, describing [...] "Sardines", Inside No. 9s first episode, by saying that it was [...] "just about some good actors in a wardrobe with a good story." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} asked United Artists for financing, but {{the studio}} would only put up $1 million. Later, the UK arm of United Artists provided an extra $100,000 {{to create the}} climax where Dr. No's base explodes. As {{a result of the}} low budget, only one sound editor was hired (normally there are two, for sound effects and dialogue), and many pieces of scenery were made in cheaper ways, with M's office featuring cardboard paintings and a door covered in a leather-like plastic, the room where Dent meets Dr. No costing only £745 to build, and the aquarium in Dr. No's base being magnified stock footage of goldfish. Furthermore, when art director Syd Cain found out his name was not in the credits, Broccoli gave him a golden pen to compensate, saying {{that he did not want}} to spend money making the credits again. Production designer Ken Adam later told UK daily newspaper The Guardian in 2005: [...] "The budget for Dr No was under $1m for the whole picture. My budget was £14,500. I filled three stages at Pinewood full of sets while they were filming in Jamaica. It wasn't a real aquarium in Dr No's apartment. It was a disaster to tell you the truth because we had so little money. We decided to use a rear projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I didn't see any reason why Dr No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fun for him to have some stolen art so we used Goya's Portrait of the Duke of Wellington, which was still missing at the time. I got hold of a slide from the National Gallery - this was on the Friday, shooting began on the Monday - and I painted a Goya over the weekend. It was pretty good so they used it for publicity purposes but, just like the real one, it got stolen while it was on display." ...|$|E
2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fun, but <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but {{it was only a matter}} of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E

2500|$|With their {{previous}} contract with Warner Bros. Records having expired in 2011, the band re-signed to Warner Bros. for the United States and to Bella Union in Europe in early 2012. The first release under these new deals was The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends, initially released as a limited edition vinyl-only package for Record Store Day on April 21. The album features collaborations with {{artists such as}} Kesha, Nick Cave, and Erykah Badu. In an interview with American Songwriter, Coyne stated that [...] "Since we were releasing music every month, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a little bit boring for us each month to say 'Well here's four more Flaming Lips songs.' We just thought 'Well we'll get some of our friends, and we'll do collaborations and see what happens.'" [...] The album later received a wider release on CD and digitally on June 26 in the US and July 30 in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, the {{producers}} let the {{users of the}} Internet vote over what direction The Simpsons should take.

The episode ends with Homer and Marge Simpson giving the viewers {{a link to the}} official The Simpsons website, TheSimpsons.com, and encouraging them to go on the website and vote over the summer of 2011 on whether Ned and Edna should stay together. Showrunner Al Jean {{said in an interview that}} the writers decided it would not be interesting for them to do another episode where a relationship ended, and they thought it would be interesting [...] "to see what people think, [...] the Internet certainly has a lot of opinion on the show, might as well have them have their say." [...] When asked why the writers thought Ned and Edna were the right characters for a cliffhanger like this, Jean said that [...] "In life, unusual things happen. People couple together in ways you would not expect, and he's single and she's single. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> funny, the fact that they both have these connections to the Simpsons but they never really met or if they have met it was minimal." [...] The result of the poll was revealed in the season 23 premiere [...] "The Falcon and the D'ohman". According to Jean, the poll was [...] "very strong in one direction". He assured in an interview before the result was presented that the poll was authentic and the writers would not undo the viewers' decision, and added that [...] "What our fans have joined together, let no writer tear asunder." ...|$|E
