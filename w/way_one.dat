5|$|In a 2011 study, {{researchers}} {{tested to}} see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed gratification by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay gratification depended {{on the amount of}} money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward. The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the <b>way</b> <b>one</b> describes the potential reward. As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse. People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain.|$|E

Two of Metro's RapidRide lines, the D Line to Ballard and the E Line on Aurora Avenue North to Shoreline, terminate in Pioneer Square. The area is also served by several east–west bus routes that travel towards First Hill, the Central District, and Leschi. Pioneer Square station {{is the main}} entry to Colman Dock and Pier 50, connecting to Washington State Ferries service to Bainbridge Island and Bremerton; Kitsap Fast Ferries service to Bremerton; and King County Water Taxi service to West Seattle and Vashon Island. Future streetcar services will serve a stop at 1st Avenue and Yesler <b>Way,</b> <b>one</b> block from the station's Prefontaine Park entrance, beginning in 2020.|$|E
5|$|The set of all {{solutions}} to a 2-satisfiability instance has {{the structure of}} a median graph, in which an edge corresponds to the operation of flipping the values of a set of variables that are all constrained to be equal or unequal to each other. In particular, by following edges in this <b>way</b> <b>one</b> can get from any solution to any other solution. Conversely, any median graph can be represented as the set of {{solutions to}} a 2-satisfiability instance in this way. The median of any three solutions is formed by setting each variable to the value it holds in the majority of the three solutions. This median always forms another solution to the instance.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} {{opinions on the}} significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy is akin to the tenets of holistic medicine, suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, holistic approach to medicine, and emphasizes the role of the primary care physician within the health care system. Others point out that {{there is nothing in the}} principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental <b>way.</b> <b>One</b> study, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.|$|E

5|$|In Paynes Prairie, {{there was}} no {{significant}} difference in rate of infection between males and females, but only 4% of juveniles were infected, compared to 52% of adults. Most species of Capillaria occur in multiple hosts, but A.forresteri has been found only in the marsh rice rat, even though several other small mammals (the round-tailed muskrat, Neofiber alleni; cotton mouse, Peromyscus gossypinus; hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus; and marsh rabbit, Sylvilagus palustris) occur in Paynes Prairie. The rice rat eats more animal food than any of those, and perhaps A.forresteri has an intermediate host that is not eaten by the other species. A.forresteri is markedly more prevalent in the wet season (spring) than the dry season (autumn), perhaps because rainfall patterns influence the habits of the rice rat in some <b>way.</b> <b>One</b> possibility is that the intermediate host is an earthworm or other oligochaete worm that moves to the surface when it rains.|$|E
5|$|To {{transform}} a probabilistically checkable proof system {{of this type}} into a clique problem, one forms a graph with a vertex for each possible accepting run of the proof checker. That is, a vertex is defined {{by one of the}} possible random choices of sets of positions to examine, and by bit values for those positions that would cause the checker to accept the proof. Two vertices are adjacent, in this graph, if the corresponding two accepting runs see the same bit values at every position they both examine. Each (valid or invalid) proof string corresponds to a clique, the set of accepting runs that see that proof string, and all maximal cliques arise in this <b>way.</b> <b>One</b> of these cliques is large if and only if it corresponds to a proof string that many proof checkers accept. If the original satisfiability instance is satisfiable, it will have a valid proof string, one that is accepted by all runs of the checker, and this string will correspond to a large clique in the graph. However, if the original instance is not satisfiable, then all proof strings are invalid, each proof string has {{only a small number of}} checker runs that mistakenly accept it, and all cliques are small. Therefore, if one could distinguish in polynomial time between graphs that have large cliques and graphs in which all cliques are small, or if one could accurately approximate the clique problem, then applying this approximation to the graphs generated from satisfiability instances would allow satisfiable instances to be distinguished from unsatisfiable instances. However, this is not possible unless P=NP.|$|E
