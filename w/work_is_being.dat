5|$|Amphibians and {{reptiles}} {{were strongly}} {{affected by the}} Carboniferous rainforest collapse (CRC), an extinction event that occurred ~307 million years ago. The Carboniferous period has long been associated with thick, steamy swamps and humid rainforests. Since plants form the base of almost all of Earth's ecosystems, any changes in plant distribution have always affected animal life to some degree. The sudden collapse of the vital rainforest ecosystem profoundly affected the diversity and abundance of the major tetrapod groups that relied on it. The CRC, which {{was a part of}} one of the top two most devastating plant extinctions in Earth's history, was a self-reinforcing and very rapid change of environment wherein the worldwide climate became much drier and cooler overall (although much new <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> done to better understand the fine-grained historical climate changes in the Carboniferous-Permian transition and how they arose).|$|E

25|$|Commercial {{fuel cells}} operate on {{reformed}} natural gas, hydrogen or methanol. Ethanol {{is an attractive}} alternative due to its wide availability, low cost, high purity and low toxicity. There are {{a wide range of}} fuel cell concepts that have been trialled including direct-ethanol fuel cells, auto-thermal reforming systems and thermally integrated systems. The majority of <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> conducted at a research level although {{there are a number of}} organizations at the beginning of commercialization of ethanol fuel cells.|$|E
25|$|Most {{governmental}} EPAs, {{including the}} United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandate that facilities that generate dust, minimize or mitigate {{the production of}} dust in their operation. The most frequent dust control violations occur at new residential housing developments in urban areas. United States Federal law requires that construction sites obtain permits to conduct earth moving, clearing of areas, to include plans to control dust emissions when the <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> carried out. Control measures include such simple practices as spraying construction and demolition sites with water, and preventing the tracking of dust onto adjacent roads.|$|E
25|$|Translations of sung texts—whether of {{the above}} type meant to be sung or of {{a more or less}} literal type meant to be read—are also used as aids to audiences, singers and conductors, when a <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> sung in a {{language}} not known to them. The most familiar types are translations presented as subtitles or surtitles projected during opera performances, those inserted into concert programs, and those that accompany commercial audio CDs of vocal music. In addition, professional and amateur singers often sing works in languages they do not know (or do not know well), and translations are then used to enable them to understand the meaning of the words they are singing.|$|E

25|$|The {{future of}} the theatre organ is always fluid, but several {{organizations}} are active in preserving and promoting these grand, old instruments. Among these are the American Theatre Organ Society and numerous independent theatre organ clubs who exist to refurbish and reinstall theatre organs to their former glory. Similar <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> done in the UK by the Cinema Organ Society and the Theatre Organ Club; in Australia the various divisions of TOSA have saved many theatre organs once in cinemas and theatres. Many of these rebuilt instruments have been installed in restaurants and auditoriums, {{as well as in}} a few theatres and churches, allowing the public to gain access to them.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 {{the line}} voltage {{was raised to}} 600 V in {{anticipation}} of the arrival of the new rolling stock. 6 November 2011 marked the last day of running for the traditional tram fleet. The tramway reopened on 4 April 2012 with Flexity 2 cars providing day to day services. Some of the traditional fleet has been retained and some of them have been restored, with unmodified trams being part of the 'Heritage Fleet' and modified, widened trams as part of the main fleet. The new depot at Starr Gate houses the Flexity 2 fleet. The Rigby Road depot, near Manchester Square, is where the traditional trams are kept. Much <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> put in {{to make sure that the}} traditional trams have a safe future.|$|E
25|$|The {{bulk of the}} Algerian Navy {{is still}} based on Cold War designs, {{although}} <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>being</b> done to both acquire new platforms as well as modernize existing equipment. The surface fleet {{is equipped with a}} mixture of smaller ships well suited to coastal and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) patrol work. The fleet is led by three Koni class frigates which have been updated with more modern systems. These are due to be augmented in the coming years by a pair of MEKO A-200 frigates which will represent the most modern equipment of the navy when they enter service, also, Algeria signed a contract with China Shipbuilding Trading Company for the construction of three light frigates about 2,800 tons full load. A mixture of six corvettes and off-shore patrol vessels complement the frigates, while a large number of smaller boats cover the role of coastal patrol. Algeria had maintained a relatively large fleet of Osa class fast attack craft {{by the end of the}} Cold War, but it is questionable whether any of these remain in operational use.|$|E
