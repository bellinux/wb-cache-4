40|$|Responsive <b>Web</b> <b>Design</b> Workflow is a {{literature}} review about Responsive <b>Web</b> <b>Design,</b> a <b>web</b> standards based modern <b>web</b> <b>design</b> paradigm. The goals {{of this research}} were to define what responsive <b>web</b> <b>design</b> is, determine its importance in building modern websites and describe a workflow for responsive <b>web</b> <b>design</b> projects. Responsive <b>web</b> <b>design</b> is a paradigm to create adaptive websites, which respond to {{the properties of the}} media that is used to render them. The three key elements of responsive <b>web</b> <b>design</b> are fluid layout, flexible media and media queries. As the numbers of mobile device users are constantly increasing, responsive <b>web</b> <b>design</b> has become an important method to improve mobile device user experience and accessibility in browsing the web. The workflow to build responsive websites consists of eight cumulative and iterative steps, which are discovery, planning, content design, sketching, prototyping, visual design, testing and discussion. As each <b>web</b> <b>design</b> project is unique and has different content, audience and goals, it is difficult to create a perfect workflow model. The responsive <b>web</b> <b>design</b> workflow described in this thesis is a recommendation and a collection of best practices for building responsive websites...|$|R

The user experience quality was measured by looking at the number of clicks and scrolls as well as information quality that has been experienced by user. The results of the ANOVA test proved that responsive <b>web</b> <b>design</b> was able to maintain the user experience quality of website on home functionality, content readability, and enjoyment using website but not on the information architecture. In addition, responsive <b>web</b> <b>design</b> was also proven {{to reduce the amount of}} scrolling when reading content.

40|$|Manuscript Draft[[abstract]]Web design {{guidelines}} are adopted by many usability evaluation methods {{as one of}} the criteria for success, while usability is proven to significantly impact Website performance. Since <b>Web</b> <b>design</b> guidelines cover a broad range of system and interface design solutions,knowledge of them can be considered as a prominent indicator of <b>Web</b> <b>design</b> skills for information systems (IS) professionals. This study empirically assessed how much IS professionals know and apply <b>Web</b> <b>design</b> guidelines via a survey to 500 randomly selected companies from Taiwan’s Fortune 2000 corporations. As expected, the knowledge-application gaps of IS professionals were statistically significant in all <b>Web</b> <b>design</b> guideline categories. Meanwhile, certain guideline categories were proven to be more difficult to acquire or apply than others. Finally, degree, gender, experience, training hours, and courses taken were also proven to be determining factors for <b>Web</b> <b>design</b> guideline skills. Implications for developing <b>Web</b> <b>design</b> guideline skills are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Web</b> <b>design</b> {{elements}} are significantly important for web designers to understand target users {{in terms of}} effective communication design {{and to develop a}} successful web site. However, <b>web</b> <b>design</b> elements generally known are broad and various that are hardly conceived and classified, so many practitioners and design researchers approach to <b>web</b> <b>design</b> elements based on graphic and visual design that mainly focus on print media design. This paper discusses about <b>web</b> <b>design</b> elements in terms of online user experience, as web media certainly differs from print media.
