40|$|Crohnâ��s {{disease is}} a chronic, {{relapsing}} inflammatory bowel disease; it affects the mucosa and deeper layers of the digestive wall. Two Crohnâ��s disease patients <b>who</b> <b>carried</b> the JW 1 variant and two patients <b>who</b> <b>carried</b> the SNP 5 variant were investigated for other co-inherited polymorphisms that could influence Crohnâ��s disease development. Based on the sequencing results, a homozygous 5 ê��-UTR- 59 G to A variant in exon 1 (SNP 6) was observed in a patient <b>who</b> <b>carried</b> SNP 5, while a heterozygous SNP 6 variant was detected in the other patient <b>who</b> <b>carried</b> SNP 5. No other associated mutations or polymorphisms were detected in the two patients <b>who</b> <b>carried</b> the JW 1 variant of the CARD 15 /NOD 2 gene...|$|R

5|$|The Nifo oti, or Samoan fire knife dance, {{is also a}} kind {{of weapon}} dance. The kailao is a {{standing}} male war dance of Tonga. The kailao is performed by men (less commonly women also perform it with the men as a mixed dance), <b>who</b> <b>carry</b> clubs or fighting sticks. The performers dance in a fierce manner to emulate combat, all {{to the accompaniment of}} a slit drum or a tin box. Additional idiophonic percussion is provided by strung rattles worn on the anklets of the dancers, and the clashing together of the wooden implements of war, which today are either sticks or mock weapons. The dance is unusual for Tonga in that it lacks recited poetry as accompaniment, which fact is taken to mean that it was imported to Tonga from elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The Park Authority {{receives}} 80% of {{its funding}} {{as a direct}} grant from the government. The Park Authority Committee consists of members from parish and county councils, and six appointed by the Secretary of State. The work is carried out by 80 staff including rangers, volunteers {{and a team of}} estate workers <b>who</b> <b>carry</b> out a wide range of tasks including maintaining the many miles of rights of way, hedge laying, fencing, swaling, walling, invasive weed control and habitat management on National Park Authority land. There are ongoing debates between the authority and farmers over the biological monitoring of SSSIs, showing the need for a controlled regime of grazing and burning; farmers claim that these regimes are not practical or effective in the long term.|$|E
5|$|The main {{characters}} each come {{from one of}} four Clans: ThunderClan, RiverClan, ShadowClan, and WindClan. All Clan cats share a belief in StarClan, a group of spirits usually represented by the stars, who are their ancestors and provide them with guidance. The Clans also follow identical hierarchy structures: Clans each have one leader, a deputy who is second-in-command, and a medicine cat who heals Clanmates in addition to communicating with StarClan. The bulk of each Clan consists of warriors, <b>who</b> <b>carry</b> out hunting for food, patrol borders, and fight battles when they occur. Apprentices are younger cats who are in training to become warriors, or more rarely, medicine cats.|$|E
5000|$|The Dionysia was {{originally}} a rural festival in Eleutherae, Attica ( [...] - Διονύσια τὰ κατ' ἀγρούς), probably celebrating {{the cultivation of}} vines. It was probably a very ancient festival, perhaps not originally associated with Dionysus. This [...] "rural Dionysia" [...] was held during the winter, {{in the month of}} Poseideon (the month straddling the winter solstice, i.e., Dec.-Jan.). The central event was the pompe (πομπή), the procession, in which phalloi (φαλλοί) were carried by phallophoroi (φαλλοφόροι). Also participating in the pompe were kanephoroi (κανηφόροι - young girls carrying baskets), obeliaphoroi (ὀβελιαφόροι- <b>who</b> <b>carried</b> long loaves of bread), skaphephoroi (σκαφηφόροι - <b>who</b> <b>carried</b> other offerings), hydriaphoroi (ὑδριαφόροι - <b>who</b> <b>carried</b> jars of water), and askophoroi (ἀσκοφόροι - <b>who</b> <b>carried</b> jars of wine).|$|R

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of the Vietnamese support the CPP, and those <b>who</b> <b>carry</b> Cambodian citizenship would vote for the party. Vietnamese support for the CPP has mostly driven by strong anti-Vietnamese sentiments from other political parties. Although many members within the rank and file of the CPP share anti-Vietnamese sentiments with other political parties, the CPP maintained an openly neutral stance towards the Vietnamese community. According to Ehrentraut, the CPP's neutral stance was a balance between not providing open support for the Vietnamese community, which would have the potential effect of losing electoral votes to other political parties, {{while at the same time}} maintaining close ties with the Vietnamese government which the CPP had historical ties dating back to 1979. Vietnamese who hold Cambodian citizenship have also expressed fear over physical insecurity during election periods, which is most apparent during the 1993 and 2013 elections when Vietnamese civilians faced physical intimidation from the Khmer Rouge and CNRP supporters respectively and have abstained from participating in elections.|$|E

50|$|The optimum {{operating}} crew of an MG 42 for sustained fire operation was six men: the gun commander, the No.1 <b>who</b> <b>carried</b> and fired the gun, the No.2 <b>who</b> <b>carried</b> the tripod, and Nos. 3, 4, and 5 <b>who</b> <b>carried</b> ammunition, spare barrels, entrenching tools, and other items. For additional protection the commander, No.1 and No.2 were armed with pistols, while {{the remaining three}} carried rifles. This large team was often reduced to just three: the gunner, the loader (also barrel carrier), and the spotter. The gunner of the weapon was preferably a junior non-commissioned officer (or Unteroffizier).|$|R
