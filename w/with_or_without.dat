30|$|The feeding habitat was {{categorized}} {{according to}} Pöysä (1983), by {{taking into account}} the water depth and {{the presence or absence of}} vegetation. Water depth was measured every 3  months using a marked rope. Additionally, the depth at the shoreline and beyond was monitored monthly to follow changes in water level. Eleven habitat types were defined: the central part of open deep water of > 30  cm deep <b>with</b> (DWV) <b>or</b> <b>without</b> (DW) emerging vegetation; the edge part of open waters, i.e., middle water, of depths > 10  cm and < 30  cm <b>with</b> (MWV) <b>or</b> <b>without</b> (MW) emerging vegetation; shoreline, i.e., shallow waters, of depths < 10  cm <b>with</b> (SWV) <b>or</b> <b>without</b> (SW) emerging vegetation; mud <b>with</b> (MUV) <b>or</b> <b>without</b> (MU) emerging vegetation; dry areas <b>with</b> (DRVN) <b>or</b> <b>without</b> (DR) vegetation next to the shoreline; and dry areas with vegetation (DRVA) inside the lake. Each point count sample contained all of these habitat types within the radius of data observation.|$|R

In this classification 324 families are recognized as valid, 214 of which are known exclusively from fossils and 110 of which occur in the recent past, <b>with</b> <b>or</b> <b>without</b> a fossil record.
