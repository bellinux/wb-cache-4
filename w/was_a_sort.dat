5|$|Gamma, {{the team}} leader and main {{combatant}} of Zombiepowder.s cast, is a 22-year-old powder hunter who desires the zombie powder {{for the sake}} of immortality, and has already obtained one Ring of the Dead at his introduction in the first chapter. Due to numerous past violent crimes, Gamma {{is one of the most}} wanted criminals in the Zombiepowder. universe, with a bounty to match. This high bounty was one of the first things determined about Gamma's character by Tite Kubo, dating back to a pre-draft rendition of the character who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of samurai. Gamma's personal history is never expounded upon, but it is implied by Balmunk that he was once a mercenary, but reformed and became a powder hunter following the death of a woman.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} Edo period, {{a master of}} haikai, Karai Senryū made an anthology. His style became known as senryū, after his pseudonym. Senryū is a style of satirical poetry whose motifs are taken from daily life in 5-7-5 syllables. Anthologies of senryū in the Edo period collect many 'maeku' or senryū made by {{ordinary}} amateur senryū poets adding {{in front of the}} latter 7-7 part written by a master. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of poetry contest and the well written senryū by amateurs were awarded by the master and other participants.|$|E
25|$|Also that year, Claudius {{had founded}} a Roman colony {{and called the}} colony Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensis or Agrippinensium, today known as Cologne, after Agrippina who was born there. This colony was the only Roman colony to be named after a Roman woman. In 51, she was given a carpentum which she used. A carpentum <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of {{ceremonial}} carriage usually reserved for priests, such as the Vestal Virgins, and sacred statues. That same year she appointed Sextus Afranius Burrus {{as the head of}} the Praetorian Guard, replacing the previous head of the Praetorian Guard, Rufrius Crispinus.|$|E

25|$|Nobility's marriages became restricted: generally, only a noblewoman was {{eligible}} for valid marriage of a nobleman {{in order to}} transmit the noble status to children. Because before 17th-century mass ennoblements, the number of nobles was actually only in hundreds, daughters of lower nobility became more often brides for wealthy Swedish noble families and even for magnate families. This was one of reasons why many Swedish family of high nobility got also one or more Finnish foremothers (a phenomenon very rare in medieval centuries when already geography <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of obstacle). Finnish nobles very often moved {{to other parts of}} the realm, to have an office in military or in government.|$|E
25|$|Founded by {{clarinet}}ist Juan de Dios Alfonso, {{who moved}} to Havana, where he played clarinet in Feliciano Ramos's band La Unión in 1856, and directed La Almendares in 1859. It is not quite clear when he formed La Flor de Cuba, which {{became one of the}} most popular in the middle of the 19th century. They played contradanzas, and other dances of the time. The orchestra was a típica, with cornet, trombone, ophicleide, two clarinets, two violins, double bass, kettle drum, and güíro. The ophicleide (ophicleide) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of bass bugle with keys, invented in 1817; the t-bone would be a valve trombone.|$|E
25|$|After Hawn's Academy Award win, {{her film}} career took off. She starred {{in a string}} of above average and {{successful}} comedies starting with There's a Girl in My Soup (1970), $ (1971), and Butterflies Are Free (1972). She continued proving herself in the dramatic league with the 1974 satirical dramas The Girl from Petrovka and The Sugarland Express, and Shampoo in 1975. She also hosted two television specials: Pure Goldie in 1971 and The Goldie Hawn Special in 1978. The latter <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of comeback for Hawn, who had been out of the spotlight for two years since the 1976 release of The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox, while she was focusing on her marriage and the birth of her son.|$|E

25|$|As Genie {{learned more}} {{language}} she gradually included more grammatical complexity in her speech during everyday interactions, {{and began to}} apply her language to more everyday situations. In late 1973 she startled linguists when she gave a monologue consisting {{of a series of}} short utterances to a small group of familiar adults, which was much longer than any of her previously recorded speech; while she only used grammar she had fully mastered she seemed to be using different words to try to express herself, which Curtiss thought <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of free association, making it the closest she came to attempting any language experimentation. Genie subsequently spoke at this length on a few more occasions, always in the same manner and on similar topics. She also began to use language to describe fictional events, describing some of fantasies in language as early as January 1973 and attempting on at least two occasions in 1974 and 1975 to lie.|$|E
25|$|The {{author of}} the De medicamentis is most likely the Marcellus who was {{appointed}} magister officiorum by Theodosius I. The heading of the prefatory epistle identifies him as a vir inlustris, translatable as “a distinguished man,” but a more formal designation of rank that indicates he had held imperial office. Marcellus’s 16th-century editor Janus Cornarius gives the unhelpful phrase ex magno officio (something like “from high office”); coupled with two references in the Theodosian Code to a Marcellus as magister officiorum, Cornarius’s phrase has been taken as a mistaken expansion of the standard abbreviation mag. off. The magister officiorum <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of Minister of the Interior and the identification is consistent with what is known of the author’s life and with {{the politics of the}} time. His stated connection to the Ausonii makes it likely that he was among the several aristocratic Gauls who benefitted politically when the emperor Gratian appointed his Bordelaise tutor Ausonius to high office and from Theodosius’s extended residence in the western empire during the latter years of his reign.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of a Vril-Society was alleged in 1960 by Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels. In their book The Morning of the Magicians, they claimed that the Vril-Society was a secret community of occultists in pre-Nazi Berlin that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of inner circle of the Thule Society. They also {{thought that it was}} in close contact with the English group known as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. The Vril information takes up about a tenth of the volume, the remainder of which details other esoteric speculations, but the authors fail to clearly explain whether this section is fact or fiction. Historians have shown that there has been no actual historical foundation for the claims of Pauwels and Bergier, and that the article of Willy Ley has only been a vague inspiration for their own ideas. Nevertheless, Pauwels and Bergier have influenced a whole new literary genre dealing with the alleged occult influences on National Socialism which have often been related to the fictional Vril Society.|$|E

500|$|Aflaq opposed Marx's {{view that}} dialectical materialism {{was the only}} truth, but {{believed}} that the [...] "importance of material economic conditions in life" [...] {{was one of the}} greatest discoveries in modern history. Even so, Aflaq was critical of both capitalism and communism, and did not want either of the two power blocs to collapse during the Cold War – believing that the Cold War <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of check and balance on their power.|$|E
500|$|Hachisuka {{believed}} the carnivorous habits described by Tafforet to be unlikely for a starling, and thought {{the lack of}} a crest suggested that it was not closely related to Fregilupus. He was reminded of corvids because of the black-and-white plumage, and assumed the bird seen by Tafforet <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of chough. In 1937, he named it Testudophaga bicolor, and coined the common name [...] "bi-coloured chough". Hachisuka's assumptions are disregarded today, and modern ornithologists find Tafforet's bird to be identical to the one described from subfossil remains.|$|E
500|$|The city of Rome had a {{place called}} the Campus Martius ("Field of Mars"), which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of drill ground for Roman soldiers. Later, the Campus became Rome's track and field playground. In the campus, the youth {{assembled}} to play and exercise, which included jumping, wrestling, boxing and racing. [...] Equestrian sports, throwing, and swimming were also preferred physical activities. [...] In the countryside, pastimes included fishing and hunting. [...] Board games played in Rome included dice (Tesserae or Tali), Roman Chess (Latrunculi), Roman Checkers (Calculi), Tic-tac-toe (Terni Lapilli), and Ludus duodecim scriptorum and Tabula, predecessors of backgammon. Other activities included chariot races, and musical and theatrical performances.|$|E

[...] Poe once wrote to a friend, [...] "I see no one among the living as beautiful as my little wife." [...] She, in turn, by many contemporary accounts, nearly idolized her husband. She often sat close to him while he wrote, kept his pens in order, and folded and addressed his manuscripts. She showed her love for Poe in an acrostic poem she composed when she was 23, dated February 14, 1846: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{previous}} poet laureate, Gerald Stern, {{said that}} he advocated for Baraka's selection because he [...] "thought {{it was important for}} the black community to get recognition." [...] Slate.com political reporter David Weigel said that McGreevey's selection of Baraka [...] "was a no-brainer—he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of icon, and a major figure within a constituency McGreevey counted on". At a ceremony in August 2002, Baraka warned McGreevey that the decision to appoint him as poet laureate might be a mistake because of his controversial views, saying [...] "You're gonna catch hell for this". After Baraka's death in January 2014, McGreevey said, [...] "I named him poet laureate because I appreciated his art, his intelligence and his creative energy. I’ve always had great personal affect(ion) for him and recognized him as a gifted creative force." ...|$|E
500|$|The Japanese experts {{did better}} at the New York Athletic Club on March 8, 1905: [...] "Their best throw <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of flying cartwheel," [...] said {{an article in the}} New York Times, {{describing}} Maeda's match with John Naething, a 200lb wrestler. [...] "Because of the difference in methods the two men rolled about the mat like schoolboys in a rough-and-tumble fight. After fifteen minutes of wrestling, Maeda secured the first fall. Ultimately, however, Naething was awarded the match by pin fall." [...] On March 21, 1905, Tomita and Maeda gave a [...] "jiu-do" [...] demonstration at Columbia University attended by about 200people. Following introductions, Tomita demonstrated falls and throws, then Maeda threw the university's wrestling instructor. According to the student newspaper, [...] "Another interesting feature was the exhibition of some of the obsolete jiu jitsu tricks for defense with a fan against an opponent armed with the curved Japanese sword."

500|$|Frazer (2004) {{notes that}} while Adams shared many {{perspectives}} with deists, [...] "Adams clearly {{was not a}} deist. Deism rejected any and all supernatural activity and intervention by God; consequently, deists {{did not believe in}} miracles or God's providence....Adams, however, did believe in miracles, providence, and, to a certain extent, the Bible as revelation." [...] Frazer further argues that Adams' [...] "theistic rationalism, like that of the other Founders, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of middle ground between Protestantism and deism." [...] By contrast, David L. Holmes has argued that Adams, beginning as a Congregationalist, ended his days as a Christian Unitarian, accepting central tenets of the Unitarian creed, but also accepting Jesus as the redeemer of humanity and the biblical account of his miracles as true. Like many of his Protestant contemporaries, Adams criticized the claims to universal authority made by the Catholic Church. In 1796, Adams denounced political opponent Thomas Paine's deistic criticisms of Christianity in The Age of Reason, saying, [...] "The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{not long}} after the rediscovery of Sappho that her {{sexuality}} once again became the focus of critical attention. [...] In the early seventeenth century, John Donne wrote [...] "Sapho to Philaenis", returning to the idea of Sappho as a hypersexual lover of women. [...] The modern debate on Sappho's sexuality began in the 19th century, with Welcker publishing, in 1816, an article defending Sappho from charges of prostitution and lesbianism, arguing that she was chaste – a position which would later be taken up by Wilamowitz {{at the end of the}} 19th and Henry Thornton Wharton at the beginning of the 20th centuries. [...] Despite attempts to defend her good name, in the nineteenth century Sappho was co-opted by the Decadent Movement as a lesbian [...] "daughter of de Sade", by Charles Baudelaire in France and later Algernon Charles Swinburne in England. [...] By the late 19th century, lesbian writers such as Michael Field and Amy Levy became interested in Sappho for her sexuality, and by the turn of the twentieth century she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sort</b> of [...] "patron saint of lesbians".|$|E

Paste magazine writer Bonnie Stiernberg called Pete Campbell [...] "one of the most complex, underrated characters on TV today" [...] and called the dripping sink [...] "more like a fucking geyser in reality, and if he doesn’t do something to plug it up soon, he’s going to drown." [...] Jordan Bartel of the Chicago Tribune called the episode [...] "a classic" [...] and saw a possible Emmy nomination for Vincent Kartheiser, but felt the kitchen sink symbolism and ending voiceover was a little heavyhanded. Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post praised Lane's character and Slattery's direction during the fight sequence, singling out Don, Bert, and Roger's reactions as [...] "absolute comedy gold". She also compared the Pete character to former U.S. President Richard Nixon because: [...] "there's a sense with Pete that there's always a chip {{on his shoulder and}} he'll eternally feel misunderstood and undervalued. He'll always inspire a mixture of pity and exasperation, because he's smart and insightful, but he can be a piece of work." ...|$|E
