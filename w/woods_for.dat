5|$|Parts of Greece were {{occupied}} by the Allied Entente forces, but Constantine I refused to modify his policy and faced increasingly open opposition from the Entente and the Venizelists. In July 1916, an arson attack ravaged Tatoi Palace and the royal family barely escaped the flames; Alexander was not injured but his mother narrowly saved Princess Katherine by carrying her through the <b>woods</b> <b>for</b> more than two kilometers. Among the palace personnel and firefighters who arrived {{to deal with the}} blaze, sixteen people were killed.|$|E
5|$|As the British {{came within}} range, the American riflemen opened fire. The American riflemen took {{cover in the}} woods, ravines and even in bends in the road, and each time the British would line up in a battle line, the riflemen would fall back and fire from cover. After Hand was forced to abandon the American {{position}} along Five Mile Run, he took up a new position, a heavily wooded area on the south bank of Shabakunk Creek. Hand deployed his men in the trees where they were so well protected from view that the British could not see them as they crossed the bridge over the stream. The riflemen fired at them from point-blank range. The intense fire confused the British into thinking that the entire American army was up against them and they formed into battle lines, bringing up their cannon. The British searched the <b>woods</b> <b>for</b> {{a half an hour}} looking for the Americans, but Hand had already withdrawn to a new position.|$|E

Throughout the South, losses of slaves were high, with many due to escapes. Slaves also escaped throughout New England and the mid-Atlantic, joining the British who had occupied New York.|$|E
25|$|Traditional manmade {{threats to}} macaques have been slash-and-burn agriculture, use of forest <b>woods</b> <b>for</b> {{construction}} and fuel, and hunting. These threats have declined due {{to social and}} economic changes in Japan since World War II, but other threats have emerged. The replacement of natural forest with lumber plantations {{is the most serious}} threat. As human prosperity has grown, macaques have lost their fear of humans and have increased their presence in both rural and urban areas, with one macaque recorded living in central Tokyo for several months.|$|E
25|$|Although the No. 21 Crimson Tide {{were two}} {{touchdown}} favorites over Northern Illinois, they were upset 19–16 {{in what was}} the first all-time win over a SEC team for the Huskies. Late in the first quarter, Alabama scored a touchdown on a 28-yard Brodie Croyle pass to Zach Fletcher. However, the extra point was blocked by Jason Frank and returned by Kevin <b>Woods</b> <b>for</b> a defensive two-point conversion and a 6–2 Crimson Tide lead.

25|$|Without {{adequate}} roads, {{the regions}} of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hard <b>woods</b> <b>for</b> export. This region retained a semi-feudal character, with little commercial agriculture, the hacienda as the dominant social unit, {{and the majority of}} the population living at a subsistence level. In the Cibao Valley, the nation's richest farmland, peasants supplemented their subsistence crops by growing tobacco for export, mainly to Germany. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on itinerant traders to transport their crops to Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi.|$|E
25|$|Control by the Teagues {{began in}} 1931 when Col. Henry N. Teague bought the Cog. He died in 1951, and Arthur S. Teague became general manager, then gained {{ownership}} in 1961. (Arthur Teague was the colonel's protégé but no relation.) After {{he died in}} 1967, the ownership passed to his wife Ellen Crawford Teague who ran the Cog as the world's first woman president of a railway. In 1983, Mrs. Teague sold the railway {{to a group of}} New Hampshire businessmen. Since 1986, the Cog Railway has been controlled and owned by Wayne Presby and Joel Bedor of Littleton, New Hampshire. The Bedor and Presby families also owned the Mount Washington Hotel and Resort in Bretton <b>Woods</b> <b>for</b> the period 1991-2006. In 1995, the railway appointed Charles Kenison the General Manager. These individuals were responsible for a complete revitalization of the railroad, with the assistance of Al LaPrade, a mechanical engineer whose career began at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. The Cog has been in continuous operation since 1869, with service interruptions only during the World Wars.|$|E
25|$|Goodman and Warner {{replaced}} Cox and Kerr. Gloucestershire won the toss and batted. The tourists had a {{good start}} taking 3 quick wickets but Stanley Brown scored a useful 60 and was out at 90/4. Charlie Townsend then joined Harry Wrathall and the pair added 209 for the fifth wicket, Gloucestershire then being 299/5. Gilbert Jessop then joined Townsend. Jessop reach his 50 in 20 minutes, 83 in 30, 102 in 43 and was out for 157 scored in an hour. He added 201 with Townsend in the hour taking the total to 500/6. His innings contain 29 4s. At this time a 6 was awarded only for hits out of the ground, so {{an unknown number of}} these 4s could have been modern-day 6s. Jessop hit Float <b>Woods</b> <b>for</b> five fours and a three in one over. Gloucestershire reached 518/7 at the close. Woods had strained himself in the previous match and could not bowl comfortably. In addition Tommie Burton damaged his foot at lunchtime and didn't bowl {{for the rest of the}} day.|$|E

In Georgia, he {{defeated}} Tim <b>Woods</b> <b>for</b> the NWA Georgia Heavyweight title, on May 10, 1968, and repeated his win in a match against Doug Gilbert (not {{to be confused with the}} Doug Gilbert who was not yet born) to retake the title. In Missouri, Wisniski competed for the Missouri Heavyweight Championship in a tournament to determine the inaugural champion. He defeated Baron von Raschke before withdrawing from the tournament due to focus his efforts on the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. After Harley Race won the tournament and the title belt, Valentine defeated him to win the championship on January 19, 1973. He dropped the belt to Terry Funk the following month. Because Funk used a chair as a weapon in front of the referee, fans demanded a rematch. Valentine was unable to compete due to heart problems, however, so Gene Kiniski took his place and won the belt from Funk. In October 1972, Wisniski defeated Jacques Rougeau for the International Heavyweight Championship, but was stripped of the title in January 1973, after he no-showed the rematch.|$|E
25|$|That night Saul is {{summoned to}} clean the dinner tables by SS-commandant Moll (Uwe Lauer). Biedermann walks in and is ordered to write {{up a list of}} seventy names. This leads Biedermann to believe that his unit will soon be gassed. Biedermann {{discloses}} the information to Abraham, who instructs Saul to head to the women's camp, where he will pick up a smuggled package of gunpowder from a prisoner named Ella. When Saul finds himself face to face with Ella, he clearly knows her. She calls him by name, clasps his hand, but he withdraws. After collecting the package, Saul deliberately falls into a line of newly arrived Hungarian Jews, who are being led into the <b>woods</b> <b>for</b> execution. Saul again looks for a rabbi among the arrivals. A Frenchman named Braun (Todd Charmont) approaches him and convinces Saul that he is a rabbi. Saul disguises Braun {{as a member of the}} Sonderkommando and sneaks him into the camp. When Saul arrives at the camp he is confronted by Abraham and realizes that during the turmoil in the woods he has lost the package. On further questioning, he says that the dead boy is his illegitimate son, an assertion Abraham says is not true.|$|E
25|$|Nearly half of Esiason's {{passing yards}} on the day came from two {{completions}} on their opening possession, a 30-yarder to Cris Collinsworth along the right sideline and a 23-yard leaping catch on {{the middle of the}} field by Eddie Brown, as the team consumed 5:49 with an 11-play, 85-yard drive and scored on Wilson's 3-yard touchdown run. Following an exchange of punts, Bengals cornerback Eric Thomas intercepted a long pass from Dave Krieg on the Bengals 25-yard line. Tight end Rodney Holman subsequently caught two passes for 20 yards and Brooks ripped off a 26-yard run as the team drove to a 14–0 lead on Wilson's second 3-yard touchdown run just over four minutes into the second quarter. Seattle was forced to a three-and-out on their possession, and Ira Hillary returned Ruben Rodriguez's 42-yard punt three yards to the Bengals 44-yard line. On the next play, Woods took a handoff and raced down the right sideline for a 30-yard carry to the Seattle 26. Then Brooks ran the ball in the opposite direction, rushing 17 yards to the 9. Wilson got the ball next, slicing through the middle for an 8-yard gain. The Seahawks defense managed to stuff <b>Woods</b> <b>for</b> no gain on the next play, but on third down, he scored a 1-yard touchdown run to give the Bengals a 21–0 lead with 7:40 left in the half.|$|E

25|$|When the Blonds' time in Los Angeles ended {{near the}} end of 1975, they {{returned}} to the Tri State promotion and immediately targeted the United States Tag Team championship. On March 18, 1976, the duo defeated Greg Valentine and Gorgeous George, Jr. Due to disputes over pay and billing the Blonds’ time in Tri State was short lived, they quickly dropped the tag team title to Buck Robley and Bob Slaughter only eleven days after they won them. The Blonds next appeared in CWF once more, winning the Florida Tag Team titles from Steve Keirn and Bob Backlund not long after arriving in the territory. Just like with Tri State, their stay in Florida was short, as they dropped the titles to Mike Graham and Ken Lucas only a few months later and left. After a short stay in Florida, the duo began working for Jim Crockett’s Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW). On January 17, 1977, Roberts and Brown defeated the team of Dino Bravo and Tim <b>Woods</b> <b>for</b> the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship and held on to it for three months until Bravo and new partner Tiger Conway Jr. beat them for the gold. During the summer of 1977, the Hollywood Blonds moved from Mid-Atlantic to Memphis and the NWA Mid-America promotion (later Continental Wrestling Association, CWA). In Memphis, the Blonds shot up the tag team ranks right off the bat defeating Bob Ellis and Jim Garvin for the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship on July 25. The Blonds lost the titkes to Norvell Austin and Pat Barrett on August 15. After holding the titles two more times, the team lost them for good to Austin and Barrett on September 25, 1977.|$|E
