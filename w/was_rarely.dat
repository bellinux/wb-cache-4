5|$|After this feud ended, Moore <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> utilised. On August 8, 2008, WWE {{announced}} that Moore {{had been released}} from his WWE contract.|$|E
50|$|The {{events of}} {{traditional}} narratives <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> set within realistic chronological frameworks. Time spans measured in years or decades <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> specified. Characters often are conceived and grow to maturity within miraculously short periods.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom {{contractual}} provisions for liquidated damages and other responses to breaches <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> enforced. Payments <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> deducted for poor performance against the contract. Government monitors {{have tended to}} be co-opted or ineffectual.|$|R
50|$|In most European countries, strikebreakers <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> used. Consequently, they <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> if ever {{mentioned}} in most European national labor laws. As mentioned above, it {{is left to}} the European Union member states to determine their own policies.|$|R
5|$|The affair {{appeared}} {{to take a}} toll on Patton's marriage; his wife Judi {{was reported to be}} living in separate quarters in the governor's mansion and <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> seen in public with him.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, the Duke and Duchess {{shuttled}} between Europe and the United States {{living a}} life of leisure as society celebrities. After the Duke's death in 1972, the Duchess lived in seclusion and <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> seen in public. Her private life {{has been a source}} of much speculation, and she remains a controversial figure in British history.|$|E
5|$|In the Holy Roman and Byzantine empires, {{imperial}} purple was a colour {{reserved for}} emperors, kings and bishops, and purple parchment <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> used for writing. This document {{is regarded as}} one of the most luxurious and beautiful examples of the use of purple parchment. In 2005, the document was proposed for inclusion in the Memory of the World Register, but was not included.|$|E
25|$|Because {{infection}} <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> symptomatic, treatment <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> required. There {{have been}} no published trials so treatment remains empirical. Agents {{that have been used}} include albendazole, metronidazole and cotrimoxazole for myositis. Corticosteroids have also been used for symptomatic relief.|$|R
50|$|They <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> cultivated.|$|R
50|$|Such reactions, {{which are}} most useful for alkyl iodides and bromides, <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> {{employed}} because {{the degree of}} alkylation is difficult to control. Selectivity can be improved via the Delépine reaction, although this <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> employed on an industrial scale.|$|R
5|$|The line {{closed to}} {{passengers}} on 15 July 1933. The section from Haxey Junction to Epworth was closed on 1 February 1956, {{by which time}} most of the traffic was peat, supplemented by seasonal sugar-beet. The branch to Hatfield Moors <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> used from 1962, when small diesel locomotives had replaced steam traction, and was closed on 30 September 1963. The rest of the system closed on 5 April 1965.|$|E
5|$|An illness {{during the}} winter of 1913–14 took its toll on Kilner {{at the start of the}} 1914 season. He passed 1,000 runs for the second time but due to his {{uncertain}} form, his aggregate of runs and his average both fell. He scored 1,329 runs (average 30.90), placing him fourth in the Yorkshire batting averages. His bowling <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> used and he took just one wicket. Kilner scored his second first-class century against Gloucestershire late in the season; he made 169 in nearly three and a half hours, hitting 28 fours. Yorkshire fell to fourth in the championship.|$|E
5|$|Arnold was the {{preferred}} choice in goal {{at the start}} of the 1983–84 season, before Southall was recalled on 1 October against Notts County. Everton had a poor start to the league campaign, but excelled in cup competitions, reaching the final of both the League Cup and the FA Cup. Southall's first appearance at Wembley was in the League Cup final against Liverpool, and he kept a clean sheet in a goalless draw. The replay was held at Maine Road, and Liverpool won the tie 1–0 with a Graeme Souness goal. He <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> called into action in the 1984 FA Cup Final, and kept a clean sheet as Everton claimed the trophy with a 2–0 victory over Watford.|$|E

40|$|Parasitic {{infection}} of the appendix <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> seen, but {{should be considered in}} patients with symptoms of chronic appendicitis. It <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> associated with histological inflammation of the appendix, therefore radiographic imaging, performed during initial workup, remains unremarkable most of the time...|$|R
5|$|As {{a medieval}} Christian author William could hardly avoid hostility towards the kingdom's Muslim neighbours, {{but as an}} educated man who lived among Muslims in the east, he <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> polemical or {{completely}} dismissive of Islam. He did not think Muslims were pagans, but rather that they belonged to a heretical sect of Christianity and followed the teachings of a false prophet. He often praised the Muslim leaders of his own day, even if he lamented their power over the Christian kingdom; thus Muslim rulers such as Mu'in ad-Din Unur, Nur ad-Din, Shirkuh, and even Jerusalem's ultimate conqueror Saladin are presented as honourable and pious men, characteristics that William did not bestow on many of his own Christian contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the case}} of its {{predecessor}} Landsat 1, the satellite's payload included two remote sensing instruments, the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) and the Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS). The specifications for these instruments were identical to those of the instruments carried on Landsat 1. The data acquired by the MSS was considered more scientifically useful than the data returned from the RBV, which <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> used and considered only for engineering evaluation purposes.|$|E
5|$|Ayers Rock {{were formed}} in the Australian pop-music scene of the early 1970s, which {{included}} artists {{in a number of}} genres: mainstream pop (Zoot and Liv Maessen), blues rock (Chain), heavy rock (Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs), and boogie (Carson). Bands such as Blackfeather and Madder Lake combined mainstream and progressive rock. Most pop and rock listeners had never heard jazz fusion; when Ayers Rock incorporated the music into their sets, it <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> performed by fellow Australian artists.|$|E

5|$|Bavaro {{struggled}} with a degenerative knee condition throughout the 1990 season and <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> able to practice. The Giants cut him in July 1991 {{because of the}} injury. After some initial dispute, the Giants signed him to a one-year US$310,000 contract and placed him on the physically unable to perform list. He spent the season as a tight end coach at Saint Dominic Savio High School in East Boston, Massachusetts. He took the position after the team's coach took a chance and wrote Bavaro a letter to {{ask him if he}} would consider coaching.|$|E
5|$|Building {{materials}} vary greatly. Brick <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> used at {{the time}} Round Hill was developing (although a few houses in Belton Road were built of it); bungaroosh was often used for walls instead. Characteristic of Brighton but almost unknown elsewhere, this consisted of random assortments of materials such as low-quality brick, cobbles, flints, pebbles, rubble, wood and sand, set in hydraulic lime and shuttered. Bungaroosh was often faced with render or stucco to make it weatherproof. Some flint buildings survive on Prince's Crescent. When built, most windows in the conservation area's houses were sashes, and roofs were of Welsh slate.|$|E
5|$|Cher {{was born}} Cherilyn Sarkisian (Armenian: Սարգիսյան) in El Centro, California on May 20, 1946. Her father, John Sarkisian, was an Armenian-American truck driver with drug and {{gambling}} problems, and her mother, Georgia Holt (born Jackie Jean Crouch), was an occasional model and bit-part actress who claimed Irish, English, German, and Cherokee ancestry.: Sarkisian's nationality and personal problems, Crouch's profession;: Sarkisian's nationality, Crouch's ancestry. Cher's father <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> home {{when she was}} an infant, and her parents divorced when Cher was ten months old. Her mother later married actor John Southall, by whom she had another daughter, Cher's half-sister.|$|E

50|$|Unlike Scrub Island, {{a larger}} {{island off the}} Eastern Tip and which has two {{excellent}} beaches, Anguillita <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> even seen, since the western tip is virtually inaccessible by foot. As such it <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> visited by tourists, though it is accessible by sea kayak.|$|R
5|$|Despite most {{games in}} the series taking place in {{different}} continuities, they do share certain elements. One of its defining traits is it being set in a contemporary urban environment, specifically modern-day Tokyo. Post-apocalyptic elements are a recurring feature in settings and narratives. This choice was originally made to set the game apart from other fantasy-based gaming franchises of the time, as modern day Tokyo <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> seen in games as opposed to versions {{of it from the}} past. The Persona series takes place exclusively within this setting, spanning a single continuity and mostly focusing on the exploits of a group of young people.|$|E
5|$|Fearing the Dutch {{would attempt}} to re-establish their {{authority}} over Indonesia, the new Republican Government and its leaders moved quickly to strengthen the fledgling administration. Within Indonesia, the newly formed government, although enthusiastic, was fragile and focused in Java (where focused at all). It <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> and loosely {{in contact with the}} outer islands, which had more Japanese troops (particularly in Japanese naval areas), less sympathetic Japanese commanders, and fewer Republican leaders and activists. In November 1945, a parliamentary form of government was established and Sjahrir was appointed Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Homosexuality {{addressed}} by television started much later than films. Local talk {{shows in the}} late 1950s first addressed homosexuality by inviting panels of experts (usually not gay themselves) to discuss the problems of gay men in society. Lesbianism <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> included. The first time a lesbian was portrayed on network television was the NBC drama The Eleventh Hour in the early 1960s, in a teleplay about an actress who feels she is persecuted by her female director, and in distress, calls a psychiatrist who explains she is a latent lesbian who has deep-rooted guilt about her feelings for women. When she realizes this, however, {{she is able to}} pursue healthy heterosexual relationships.|$|E
50|$|Various methods {{exist to}} promote {{disaster}} preparedness, but they <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> well documented and their efficacy <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> tested. Hands on training, drills and face-to-face interaction have proven more successful at changing behaviour. Digital methods {{have also been}} used, including for examples educational videogames.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{customer}} demand <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> perfectly stable, businesses must {{forecast demand}} to properly position inventory and other resources. Forecasts {{are based on}} statistics, and they <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> perfectly accurate. Because forecast errors are given, companies often carry an inventory buffer called [...] "safety stock".|$|R
5000|$|Open texture: Law <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> {{applied in}} an exact way to {{specific}} facts, and exact outcomes <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> a certainty. Statutes {{may be interpreted}} according to different linguistic interpretations, reliance on precedent cases or other contextual factors including a particular judge's conception of fairness.|$|R
