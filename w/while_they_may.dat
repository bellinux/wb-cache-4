5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there is a fantastic {{occurrence}} constitute a change in point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events from the perspective of the slaves highlights their otherness, because <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E
5|$|The {{components}} in an electric circuit {{can take many}} forms, which can include elements such as resistors, capacitors, switches, transformers and electronics. Electronic circuits contain active components, usually semiconductors, and typically exhibit non-linear behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric components {{are those that are}} termed passive and linear: <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli.|$|E
5|$|The work {{is rich in}} {{symbolism}} and iconographic elements, to an extent far more pronounced than that in The Madonna Standing. An iris grows {{to the side of}} the aedicula, representing the Virgin's sorrow at the Passion, and on the other side a columbine, recalling the Sorrows of the Virgin. This symbolic use of flowers is again a van Eyckian motif. <b>While</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> appear incongruous with the architectural setting, this was probably the effect that van der Weyden was seeking.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} iterations, no search {{algorithm}} that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst case performance than binary search. This {{is because the}} comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as each level is filled completely with nodes if there are enough. Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, {{increasing the number of}} iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> work faster on some target values, the average performance over all elements is affected. This problem is solved by binary search, as dividing the array in half ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.|$|E
25|$|These {{competitions}} usually {{involve the}} turn-taking and shine/all-skate formats {{described in the}} Jack and Jill section, though {{in a range of}} combinations. <b>While</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> also be invitation-only, they are frequently open to all competitors, from all experience levels.|$|E
25|$|The protesters {{have formed}} two {{distinct}} camps: pro-European sympathizers {{and those who}} support pro-Russian parties. But <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be separated by aspirations and ideologies, both sides have similar aims: {{the resignation of the}} government, the conviction of corrupt oligarchs and early elections.|$|E

25|$|Indian {{martial arts}} {{refers to the}} {{fighting}} systems of the Indian subcontinent. A variety of terms are used for the English phrases “Indian martial arts”, usually deriving from Sanskrit or Dravidian sources. <b>While</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> seem to imply specific disciplines (e.g. archery, armed combat), by Classical times they were used generically for all fighting systems.|$|E
25|$|After Auschwitz the Christian churches {{no longer}} wish {{to convert the}} Jews. <b>While</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not be sure of the {{theological}} grounds that dispense them from this mission, the churches have become aware that asking the Jews to become Christians is a spiritual way of blotting them out of existence and thus only reinforces {{the effects of the}} Holocaust.|$|E
25|$|These guilds usually {{represent}} {{a group of}} individuals that share the same interests and goals. <b>While</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be organized around in-game economic production, they generally do not control production. Guilds in online games can {{range in size from}} a small group of a few players to massive guilds that have players from around the world.|$|E

25|$|However, one can {{determine}} if two manifolds are different {{if there is}} some intrinsic characteristic that differentiates them. Such criteria are commonly referred to as invariants, because, <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be defined in terms of some presentation (such as the genus in terms of a triangulation), they are the same relative to all possible descriptions of a particular manifold: they are invariant under different descriptions.|$|E
25|$|Others have objected {{that the}} {{language}} of the speeches is too Lukan in style to reflect anyone else's words. Moreover, George Shillington writes that the author of Acts most likely created the speeches accordingly and they bear his literary and theological marks. Conversely, Howard Marshall writes that the speeches were not entirely the inventions of the author and <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> not be accurate word-for-word, the author nevertheless records the general idea of them.|$|E
25|$|Since {{no records}} are kept or {{required}} to be kept of how many disruptions occur beyond those filed in court, which are confidential, {{there is no way}} to be sure how many are occurring. Anecdotal evidence, however, has suggested that <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have decreased as a whole through 1997 (when the Adoption and Safe Families Act was passed), for adoptions of Eastern-European born children they may well have increased, and thus the rate may have stabilized.|$|E

25|$|There are games which {{feature a}} heavy degree of {{shooting}} {{but do not}} fall into this subgenre. Mega Man, Metroid, Vectorman, Jazz Jackrabbit, Earthworm Jim and Turrican are all platformers with a heavy focus on action and shooting, but unlike Contra or Metal Slug, platform jumping elements, as well as exploration and back-tracking, still figure prominently. Run and guns are generally very pure, and <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have vehicular sequences or other changes in style, they stay focused on shooting throughout.|$|E
25|$|<b>While</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> {{not have}} {{recognized}} the collusion of the C and N, Page and Rogers did know that the larger railroads would surely attempt to block any effort to extend the Deepwater a great distance to reach any other major trunk lines, many of which such as the New York Central, Pennsylvania and Baltimore and Ohio Railroad were also under common control of sorts (although {{it is not known}} if Page and Rogers realized or even suspected this). However, to their advantage, the Deepwater Railway charter already granted by West Virginia came to a location within a fairly short distance of the Virginia state line.|$|E
25|$|Lichenology {{began at}} the Soldiers Delight NEA in 1976, when Allen C. Skorepa, Arnold Norden , and Donald Windler were awarded {{a grant from the}} Power Plant Siting Program of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to survey the lichens of Maryland. They {{surveyed}} the lichens from many areas throughout the state; one of which was Soldiers Delight. In 1977, they published their results and reported one location for each species of lichen that they identified. Thus, <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> have collected a particular species from numerous places they documented only one. So while they found numerous species of lichens at Soldiers Delight, only a few got recorded in their publication.|$|E

5000|$|People in {{this class}} tend to be {{classified}} as LW skiers. The International Paralympic Committee defined that class as [...] "Competitors with severe disabilities in both lower limbs ... The typical disability profile of the class is double above-knee amputation." [...] <b>While</b> skiing, <b>they</b> <b>may</b> use a prosthesis. In the Biathlon, skiers {{in this class}} can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|R
25|$|Penicillins may {{decrease}} {{the elimination of}} methotrexate, so {{increase the risk of}} toxicity. <b>While</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be used together, increased monitoring is recommended. The aminoglycosides, neomycin and paromomycin, have been found to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of methotrexate. Probenecid inhibits methotrexate excretion, which increases the risk of methotrexate toxicity. Likewise, retinoids and trimethoprim have been known to interact with methotrexate to produce additive hepatotoxicity and haematotoxicity, respectively. Other immunosuppressants like ciclosporin may potentiate methotrexate's haematologic effects, hence potentially leading to toxicity. NSAIDs have also been found to fatally interact with methotrexate in numerous case reports. Nitrous oxide potentiating the haematological toxicity of methotrexate has also been documented. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and the anticonvulsant valproate have been found to increase the plasma concentrations of methotrexate, as have nephrotoxic agents such as cisplatin, the GI drug colestyramine, and dantrolene.|$|E
500|$|<b>While</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> {{have been}} thought to cause disease with magical weapons, elves are more clearly {{associated}} in Old English {{with a kind}} of magic denoted by Old English sīden and sīdsa, cognate with Old Norse seiðr, and also paralleled in the Old Irish Serglige Con Culainn. [...] By the fourteenth century they were also associated with the arcane practice of alchemy.|$|E
500|$|The archaeologists Stuart and Cecily Piggott {{believed}} that the circles of Dorset were probably of Bronze Age origin, a view endorsed by Burl, who noted that their distribution did not match that of any known Neolithic sites. It is possible {{that they were not}} all constructed around the same date, and the Piggotts suggested that <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>may</b> well be Early Bronze Age in date, {{it is also possible that}} [...] "their use and possibly their construction may last into the Middle and even into the Late Bronze Age".|$|E

5000|$|Senbei {{are usually}} cooked by being baked or grilled, {{traditionally}} over charcoal. <b>While</b> being prepared <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be brushed with a flavoring sauce, often one made of {{soy sauce and}} mirin. <b>They</b> <b>may</b> then be wrapped {{with a layer of}} nori. Alternatively <b>they</b> <b>may</b> be flavored with salt or [...] "salad" [...] flavoring, among others.|$|R
50|$|In the wild, {{they are}} shy animals and flee from humans, <b>while</b> in captivity <b>they</b> <b>may</b> become trusting. In Trinidad, they are renowned for being very fast runners, {{able to keep}} hunting dogs {{occupied}} with chasing them for hours.|$|R
