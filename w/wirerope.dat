60|$|An immensely complex {{plan had}} {{suddenly}} flashed into Findlayson's mind. He saw the ropes running from boat to boat in straight lines and angles--each rope {{a line of}} white fire. But there was one rope which was the master rope. He could see that rope. If he could pull it once, it was absolutely and mathematically certain that the disordered fleet would reassemble itself in the backwater behind the guard-tower. But why, he wondered, was Peroo clinging so desperately to his waist as he hastened down the bank? It was necessary to put the Lascar aside, gently and slowly, because {{it was necessary to}} save the boats, and, further, to demonstrate the extreme ease of the problem that looked so difficult. And then--but it was of no conceivable importance--a <b>wirerope</b> raced through his hand, burning it, the high bank disappeared, and with it all the slowly dispersing factors of the problem. He was sitting in the rainy darkness--sitting in a boat that spun like a top, and Peroo was standing over him.|$|E
50|$|All the {{buildings}} in block 3 {{are currently in}} disuse and have experienced significant decay. The block {{has been the subject}} of many redevelopment efforts and is currently slated for redevelopment as lofts, offices, commercial space, and a piazza for events. Funds have been raised to convert building 101 to the <b>Wirerope</b> lofts, with construction slated to begin in 2015. It is expected that the renovation of the rest of the complex, including the construction of new buildings and a parking garage, will follow.|$|E
50|$|Cunningham {{enlisted in}} the Pennsylvania National Guard in 1913 and served on the Mexican border as an artilleryman. In 1916, he was an {{assistant}} coach under Doggie Trenchard at the University of North Carolina. In the Fall of 1917, he was commissioned as a first lieutenant at Camp Hancock in Augusta, Georgia, and served in the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps. On March 30, 1918, he was seriously hurt in an aircraft accident at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, suffering a dislocated hip and fractured arm. By February 1919, he had returned to civilian life and {{was working at the}} Williamsport <b>Wirerope</b> Works in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.|$|E
40|$|Recently, the Special Committee for Earthquake Resistant Reactor hasdiscussed on the {{earthquake}} hazard and aseismic {{design of a}} British type NuclearPower Station {{to be built in}} Japan. The aseismic design proposed at the Committeeby author is reported in this paper. As the structural parts of the reactor insidethe biological shielding structure-graphite pile, diagrid and pressure vessel etc. -where the post-operation repair work is not feasible, should be designed safelyagainst every possible damage due to the large displacement and acceleration of{{the earthquake}}, it is most desirable that these parts are not accelerated and de-formed by the destructive earthquake. Then the reactor is to be designed to have the low pass filter vibrating systemwith the nonlinear elasticity. That is to say, in details, the diagrid of the reactoris connected with the biological shielding concrete wall by the flexible steel <b>wireropes</b> and is placed on the concrete basement by the supporting columns that havehinged joints at each end. These wire ropes and columns are respectively designedas to safely resist the horizontal and vertical components of the seismic accelera-tion. Especially in Chapter 4, the low pass filter system of the reactor is analyzedand several numerical examples of it are calculated...|$|R
40|$|With current {{construction}} technology of offshore wind turbines, {{there is a}} need for a major marine spread to install the foundation, tower and turbine. There is a clear benefit that offshore installation can be integrated into one operation. The large-scale composite bucket foundation is a basis for the one-step integrated transportation and installation technique with a special vessel. The proposed transportation and installation technique will minimize offshore spread and maximize the proportion of work carried out onshore with consequent benefits in terms of cost, quality and safety. The composite bucket foundation with self-floating property would be towing into a semicircle groove of the vessel and connected with <b>wireropes</b> of the fixed crane. Afterwards, tower and turbine are attached onto the foundation at shore and the whole unit of foundation, tower and turbine is loaded out from the quayside, transported to site and set down on the seabed. During transportation, half of the unit weight is taken by the hoisting system of the vessel and other weight is supported by air cushions inside the composite bucket foundation. A detailed case is studied to determine the motions of the vessel with two units to confirm the viability and feasibility of such a method of the integrated transportation. The transportation and installation methodology are developed to reduce the time spent on offshore works in order to fit the installation work within the time windows with great economic benefits...|$|R
50|$|Work was {{undertaken}} to rehabilitate the bridge starting in 2000 by Cianbro and Piasecki Steel Construction Corp. with cable work by Williamsport <b>Wirerope</b> Works Inc, {{by focusing on}} strengthening the cables. The two cables were done separately, one a time. Piasecki Steel Construction Corp., Castleton, N.Y., rehabilitated the north cable in 2002. At this point the bridge was discovered to be beyond permanent repair {{and would have to}} be abandoned and replaced by a new structure to be built adjacent to the aging bridge. Work then shifted to temporary strengthening. For the south cable, MDOT in August 2003 hired Pittsfield, Maine-based Cianbro Corp. under a $4-million emergency contract.|$|E
40|$|The micromanipulator’s force {{feedback}} {{is one of}} the key research contents of minimally invasive surgical robotic system. Because the micromanipulator is a kind of compact construction which is suitable for valve installation with small space in surgery, especially for the influence of disinfection method, there are major difficulties and limitations to integrate compact sensors in the end of micromanipulator. This article focuses on the 3 -degree-of-freedom micromanipulator’s clamping force sensing, and these three joints are actuated by <b>wirerope</b> driving. A clamping force sensing method is proposed based on static tension of <b>wirerope</b> driving, and a static model between the clamping force and wirerope’s static tension is established considering the influence of real friction resistance in the mechanical system. Finally, an equivalent experimental test platform for 3 -degree-of-freedom micromanipulator’s clamping force sensing is set up, and then a series of experiments of the clamping force are studied. The frictional resistances of <b>wirerope</b> between the guide plate and guide pulley mechanism are tested, and a calibration and correction method of the experimental clamping force is proposed. The final experiment results show that the total average accuracy of experimental clamping force is about 78. 3 %, and it can be the basic measurement force to realize micromanipulator’s clamping {{force feedback}} of a minimally invasive surgical robot...|$|E
40|$|Until now, {{most of the}} {{hydraulic}} hand tools for underwater application still use mineral oil as the system fluid medium. Due to the incompatibility with marine environment, these systems have highlighted a series of disadvantages. Therefore using seawater hydraulic tools has become a tendency in ocean engineering. In this paper, the design on a novel seawater hydraulic <b>wirerope</b> cutter for divers was introduced in detail based on its original prototype. A test rig with computer data acquisition system using Matlab/xPC was developed for testing the tool 2 ̆ 7 s performances. A group of wireropes with different diameters were used as specimen and they were cut off smoothly by the new developed tool in all the tests. The maximum pressures and necessary cutting forces for cutting off <b>wirerope</b> specimen were obtained by experiments. The {{results show that the}} cutting forces have linear relationship with the cross-sectional areas of the wireropes. It 2 ̆ 7 s verified by experiments that the tool is successfully designed and it has been applied in underwater application...|$|E
