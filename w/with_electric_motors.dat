25|$|According to The Times Leader, {{most of the}} 330,000 annual {{visitors}} to Ricketts Glen State Park visit Lake Jean. In 2014, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission temporarily lifted fishing restrictions in Lake Jean {{in preparation for the}} lake's draining. Ice fishing is permitted on the lake in the wintertime. There are also two boat launches on the lake. Both motorboats <b>with</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> and non-powered boats are permitted. There are picnic facilities along Lake Jean.|$|E
25|$|Swimming, boating, and sunbathing are {{permitted}} on the lake.

25|$|The Il-18B was {{powered by}} four Ivchenko AI-20A Series 1 turboprops, each {{providing}} a takeoff power of 2,985kW (4,000 shp) and sustained power of 2,090kW (2,800 shp) at cruise altitude. Early Il-18A production had initially been fitted with Kuznetsov NK-4 engines, {{but they were}} soon exchanged for AI-20s. Later Il-18B production featured AI-20A Series 2 engines, with the same power ratings, but with technical improvements, thus older machines were updated with the Series 2 powerplants. The AI-20s drove four-bladed variable pitch reversible props with a diameter of 4.5 meters (14 feet 9 inches), featuring prominent propeller spinners, and hydraulic actuation for prop pitch. The engines were mounted above the wing and featured integrated fire extinguishers. The engines were started <b>with</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motors,</b> the power for the motors being provided by a ground cart.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{original}} LF-A concept, development time was lengthened by {{the switch from}} an aluminum frame to a carbon fibre tub, the result of engineering efforts aimed at improving the LF-A's power-to-weight ratio. The LF-A was reported to draw engineering resources from Toyota's Formula One team. In January 2007, a restyled LF-A concept car premiered alongside the first production F marque vehicle, the IS F sports sedan. The second LF-A concept featured a more aerodynamic exterior, a near-production interior, and F marque emblems. Later that year, Lexus GB director Steve Settle indicated plans for a V10 and hybrid version of the LF-A. The hybrid version, combining a petrol engine <b>with</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motors,</b> would likely feature a V8 powertrain similar to that designed for the Lexus LS 600h L. LF-A test mules continued to be spotted at the Nürburgring, including early models with a large, fixed rear wing. In December 2007, Auto Express reported that the LF-A had set an unofficial 7:24 lap record at the Nürburgring.|$|E
25|$|Development of the third-generation RX {{began in}} 2004. Chief {{engineer}} Takayuki Katsuda headed development, with design being conducted from 2005. In late 2006 design work by Masanari Sakae was chosen, {{with the final}} designs that were presented as 1:1 scale models being green-lighted for production {{in the first half}} of 2007. On 9 October 2007 design patents were filed at the Japanese Patent Office (7 April 2008 in the U.S.) for both a conceptual variant and two production variants (RX and RX 450h). The first North American pre-production prototypes were sent to Cambridge, Canada in early 2008 for testing prior to the first RX 350 rolling off the production line on 28 November 2008. A hybrid concept vehicle, the LF-Xh, previewed the third-generation RX's design direction at international auto shows a year prior to the production model's debut. The LF-Xh, which stands for Lexus Future-Crossover(X) hybrid, was first shown at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. The LF-Xh featured a V6 engine <b>with</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motors,</b> LED headlights and taillights, and a concept interior.|$|E

25|$|Richmond emerged {{a decade}} after the {{smoldering}} rubble of the Civil War to resume its position as an economic powerhouse, with iron front buildings and massive brick factories. Canal traffic peaked in the 1860s and slowly gave way to railroads, allowing Richmond to become a major railroad crossroads, eventually including the site of the world's first triple railroad crossing. Tobacco warehousing and processing continued to play a role, boosted by the world's first cigarette-rolling machine, invented by James Albert Bonsack of Roanoke in 1880/81. Contributing to Richmond's resurgence was the first successful electrically powered trolley system in the United States, the Richmond Union Passenger Railway. Designed by electric power pioneer Frank J. Sprague, the trolley system opened its first line in 1888, and electric streetcar lines rapidly spread to other cities across the country. Sprague's system used an overhead wire and trolley pole to collect current, <b>with</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> on the car's trucks. In Richmond, the transition from streetcars to buses began in May 1947 and was completed on November 25, 1949.|$|E
500|$|Most of The Italian Job {{was shot}} on location, at sites Pfister scouted over 12 weeks during pre-production, but some scenes were filmed on sets. The Venice {{building}} where the film's opening heist sequence takes place, the van {{from which the}} thieves survey Steve Frazelli's mansion, a hotel room, and the LACMTA Red Line subway tunnel were sets constructed at Downey Studios in California. For the scene in which an armored truck falls through Hollywood Boulevard and into the subway tunnel below, Pfister set up seven cameras to capture the vehicle's ~ descent. Three hundred cars were used to simulate the traffic jam {{at the intersection of}} Hollywood and Highland, which was controlled by the production crew for a week. Three of the 32 custom-built Mini Coopers used during principal photography were fitted <b>with</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> since combustion engines were not allowed in the subway tunnels, where some scenes were shot. Other Mini Coopers were modified to allow for camera placement on and inside the vehicles. The director remarked that [...] " [...] part of the cast." ...|$|E
500|$|The Derfflinger-class {{ships were}} armed with eight 30.5cm (12in) SK L/50 guns in four twin gun turrets, two {{forward of the}} main {{superstructure}} in a superfiring pair and two {{to the rear of}} the ship, in a similar arrangement. The guns were housed in Drh.L C/1912 mounts on the first two ships, and in Drh.L C/1913 mounts on Hindenburg. The turrets were trained <b>with</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motors,</b> while the guns were elevated hydraulically, up to 13.5degrees. The guns fired 405.5-kilogram (894lb) armor-piercing shells at a muzzle velocity of 855meters per second (2,805ft/s). At 13.5degrees, the shells could hit targets out to [...] The turrets were modified in 1916 to increase the elevation maximum to 16degrees. This correspondingly increased the range to [...] The ships carried 720 shells, or 90 per gun; each gun was supplied with 65 armor-piercing (AP) shells and 25 semi-AP shells for use against targets with less armor protection. The 30.5cm gun had a rate of fire of between 2–3 shells per minute, and was expected to fire 200 shells before replacement was necessary. The guns were also capable of firing 405.9kg (894.8lb) high explosive shells. The shells were loaded with two RP C/12 propellant charges: a main charge in a brass cartridge that weighed 91kg (201lb) and a fore charge in a silk bag that weighed 34.5kg (76lb). The propellant magazines were located underneath the shell rooms for the two forward turrets as well as the rear superfiring turret; the arrangement was reversed for the rearmost turret.|$|E

[...] With such a traffic density, the expense of electrification could be easily recouped.
