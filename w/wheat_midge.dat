The first phase comprised a temperature accumulation of 250 degree-days (DD) above 3 °C, starting from 1 January. Once this initial condition is satisfied, the second phase starts, and it lasts until the occurrence of a double signal consisting of a rise in the mean daily temperature up to 13 °C, followed by rainfall.

In each experiment, the fungicides were compared with a positive (insecticide) and a negative control (water). Four fungicides were assessed in the laboratory, each with five doses based on basis of a tenfold dilution starting at the field-recommended dose.

40|$|The orange <b>wheat</b> blossom <b>midge,</b> Sitodiplosis mosellana (Géhin), can {{significantly}} reduce wheat yield. Growing resistant wheat cultivars {{is an effective}} way of managing this pest. The assessment of cultivar resistance in field trials is difficult because of unequal pressure of S. mosellana caused by differences in cultivar heading dates relative to the flight period of S. mosellana adult females and huge variations of egg laying conditions from 1 day to another. To overcome these hurdles and to expose all cultivars homogeneously to the pest, an assessment method of cultivar resistance was developed under semi-field conditions. In 2015, the resistance of 64 winter wheat cultivars to S. mosellana was assessed. Few or no larvae developed in the ears of resistant cultivars, but in susceptible cultivars, large numbers of larvae developed. Seventeen cultivars proved to be resistant, whereas 47 were susceptible. The identification of new resistant cultivars offers more opportunities to manage S. mosellana.

40|$|Zu den Ährenschädlingen am Winterweizen zählen die Gelbe Weizengallmücke (C. tritici (Kirby)) und die Orangerote Weizengallmücke (S. mosellana (Géhin)) (Holland & al., 1996). In Abhängigkeit vom Befallsstadium der Weizenähre und der Biologie der Erreger sind folgende Schadsymptome bekannt: Verminderung der Kornzahl pro Ähre (C. tritici) bzw. geschrumpfte oder missgebildete Körner (S. mosellana) (Mölck, 2006). Der Saatgutwert wird beeinträchtigt und die Backqualität beeinflusst (Miller & Halton, 1961). Hinsichtlich Prognose und Überwachung des Auftretens von Weizengallmücken gab es bisher keine praxistauglichen methodischen Ansätze im Bundesland Sachsen-Anhalt. Hinzu kommt, dass der derzeit verstärkt praktizierte pfluglose Anbau von Weizen nach Weizen ein höheres Befallsrisiko erwarten lässt. Mit der Identifikation von Sexualpheromonen, die als hoch attraktiv für Männchen von S. mosellana gelten (Gries & al., 2000), eröffnen sich nun neue Prognosemöglichkeiten. Die effektive Nutzung von Pheromonfallen zum Monitoring von Gallmücken könnte somit ein erster Baustein zur Erarbeitung praxistauglicher Richtwerte darstellen. In einer zweijährigen Testphase wurde in Zusammenarbeit mit der Landesanstalt für Landwirtschaft, Forsten und Gartenbau geprüft, ob die Pheromonfallen eine Gradationswahrscheinlichkeit der Problemschädlinge, insbesondere in Risikofruchtfolgen signalisieren können. Die Ergebnisse sowie Daten zu weiteren Überwachungsansätzen werden präsentiert. Lemon <b>wheat</b> blossom <b>midges</b> (Contarinia tritici) and Orange <b>wheat</b> blossom <b>midges</b> (Sitodiplosis mosellana) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) {{belong to}} the most {{prominent}} insect pests in winter wheat (Holland & al., 1996). However, no practical method exists to predict or monitor {{the impact of these}} insect pests. There is also a lack of recent research on the issue particulary for Central Germany (older studies include: Lübke & Wetzel, 1984, Volkmar & 1989). Consequently, this study attempts to provide new data on the occurrence, monitoring and crop damage of <b>wheat</b> blossom <b>midges.</b> It also focuses on the impact of changing agricultural conditions such as wheat-to-wheat crop rotation, reduced soil tillage or different crop variants. A systematic survey of midge occurrence and crop damage in a wheat-to-wheat crop rotation was carried out at a research field (variants: Elvis, Altos in 2005) and conventional winter wheat fields in 2006 (variant Tommi). S. mosellana were monitored by means of pheromone traps. In 2006, white traps were tested as an alternative method to collect data on S. mosellana and C. tritici. Flight activity of adult midges was monitored on 13 different dates (Tab. 1). Crop damage was evaluated on 8 dates (Tab. 2). A total of 50 spikes per variant and date were randomly selected for microscopical examination. The analysis included parameters such as number of larvae per infested seed, number of corn thrips (larvae and adults) per spike or number of infested seeds per spike. In 2005, the activity of adult S. mosellana reached its peak in the phenological growth stage of full flowering (BBCH 65 - 69). The activity density was higher in the Elvis variant with 260 midges per trap (monitoring until mid-flowering) as compared to the Altos variant with 89 midges per trap (monitoring until the end of flowering period). In 2006, the activity of adult S. mosellana reached its peak in BBCH 51 (beginning of heading) with 246 midges per trap (Tommi variant). In 2005 the highest abundance of larvae per ear was established for BBCH 75 with an average of 2. 1 (Altos) and 1. 6 (Elvis). In 2006 these numbers were significantly higher. In the Tommi variant, an average of 14. 3 larvae per ear was reached during BBCH 70 - 73. The ratio of midge-damaged kernels was evaluated in 2005 on BBCH 80 - 85 with 6. 3 % (Altos) and 4. 4 % (Elvis), while in 2006 a ratio of 23. 5 % was reached in the Tommi variant. The results suggest that the intensity of crop damage depends on the correlation of two factors. The closer the activity peak of midges correlate with the sensitive wheat growth stage of heading (BBCH 50 - 59), the higher the crop damage. This is highlighted by the results of 2006 in the Tommi variant. In other cases, S. mosellana reached its activity peak much later (in 2005 during BBCH 65 - 69, resp. in 2006 on BBCH 73 - 75) and the ensuing crop damage was significantly smaller. In conclusion, the results of this survey in Central Germany stress the influence of changing agricultural conditions and regional cultivation concepts. They also recommend further studies that cover several years in open habitats...|$|R

Sm 1 was previously mapped to wheat chromosome arm 2 BS relative to simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and the dominant, sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker WM 1. The objectives of this research were to saturate the Sm 1 region with markers, develop improved markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS), and examine the synteny between wheat, Brachypodium distachyon, and rice (Oryza sativa) in the Sm 1 region. The present study mapped Sm 1 in four populations relative to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), SSRs, Diversity Array Technology (DArT) markers, single strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCPs), and the SCAR WM 1. Numerous high quality SNP assays were designed that mapped near Sm 1. BLAST delineated the syntenic intervals in B. distachyon and rice using gene-based SNPs as query sequences. The Sm 1 region in wheat was inverted relative to B. distachyon and rice, which suggests a chromosomal rearrangement within the Triticeae lineage.

Research presented in this thesis primarily focuses on identifying midgut-expressed genes in the insect during its interaction with wheat. The first part of the thesis concentrates on the aspect of digestion and includes data on two midgut-specific serine proteases and a putative peritrophin gene.

40|$|Abstract Background In most protein-coding genes, greater {{sequence}} {{variation is}} observed in noncoding regions (introns and untranslated regions) than in coding regions due to selective constraints. During characterization of genes and transcripts encoding small secreted salivary gland proteins (SSSGPs) from the Hessian fly, we found {{exactly the opposite}} pattern of conservation in several families of genes: the non-coding regions were highly conserved, but the coding regions were highly variable. Results Seven genes from the SSSGP- 1 family are clustered as one inverted and six tandem repeats within a 15 kb region of the genome. Except for SSSGP- 1 A 2, a gene that encodes a protein identical to that encoded by SSSGP- 1 A 1, the other six genes consist of a highly diversified, mature protein-coding region as well as highly conserved regions including the promoter, 5 '- and 3 '-UTRs, a signal peptide coding region, and an intron. This unusual pattern of highly diversified coding regions coupled with highly conserved regions {{in the rest of}} the gene was also observed in several other groups of SSSGP-encoding genes or cDNAs. The unusual conservation pattern was also found in some of the SSSGP cDNAs from the Asian rice gall midge, but not from the orange <b>wheat</b> blossom <b>midge.</b> Strong positive selection was one of the forces driving for diversification whereas concerted homogenization was likely a mechanism for sequence conservation. Conclusion Rapid diversification in mature SSSGPs suggests that the genes are under selection pressure for functional adaptation. The conservation in the noncoding regions of these genes including introns also suggested potential mechanisms for sequence homogenization that are not yet fully understood. This report should be useful for future studies on genetic mechanisms involved in evolution and functional adaptation of parasite genes. </p...|$|R
40|$|The orange wheat blossom midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana (Géhin) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), is a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) pest {{that can}} cause {{significant}} yield losses. Several hymenopterous parasitoids are known to attack S. mosellana. For the effective biological control of this pest by its parasitoids, the hostparasitoid synchrony is particularly important. The synchronization between the emergence of S. mosellana and its parasitoids was studied under controlled conditions with soils sampled from two locations. For both sites, three parasitoid species were identified: Macroglenes penetrans (Kirby) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), Euxestonotus error (Fitch) (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) and Platygaster tuberosula (Kieffer) (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae). The hypothesis that parasitoid emergence is triggered by the same rainfall that induces host emergence was tested by simulating three rainfall events, a week apart. The parasitoid M. penetrans emerged later than S. mosellana {{with a mean of}} 57 ± 7 DD (degree-days above 7 °C) for insects collected from Juprelle and 68 ± 10 DD for those from Veurne (i. e., 4 - 5 days after its host).

40|$|The <b>wheat</b> <b>midge,</b> Sitodiplosis mosellana, is an {{important}} pest in Northern China. We tested {{the hypothesis that the}} population structure of this species arises during a range expansion over the past 30 years. This study used microsatellite and mitochondrial loci to conduct population genetic analysis of S. mosellana across its distribution range in China. We found strong genetic structure among the 16 studied populations, including two genetically distinct groups (the eastern and western groups), broadly consistent with the geography and habitat fragmentation. These results underline the importance of natural barriers in impeding dispersal and gene flow of S. mosellana populations. Low to moderate genetic diversity among the populations and moderate genetic differentiation (F ST =  0. 117) between the two groups were also found. The populations in the western group had lower genetic diversity, higher genetic differentiation and lower gene flow (F ST =  0. 116, Nm =  1. 89) than those in the eastern group (F ST =  0. 049, Nm =  4. 91). Genetic distance between populations was positively and significantly correlated with geographic distance (r =  0. 56, P< 0. 001). The population history of this species provided no evidence for population expansion or bottlenecks in any of these populations. Our data suggest that the distribution of genetic diversity, genetic differentiation and population structure of S. mosellana have resulted from a historical event, reflecting its adaptation to diverse habitats and forming two different gene pools. These results may be the outcome of a combination of restricted gene flow due to geographical and environmental factors, population history, random processes of genetic drift and individual dispersal patterns.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many insects enter a {{developmental}} arrest (diapause) {{that allows them}} to survive harsh seasonal conditions. Despite the well-established ecological significance of diapause, the molecular basis of this crucial adaptation remains largely unresolved. Sitodiplosis mosellana (Gehin), the orange <b>wheat</b> blossom <b>midge</b> (OWBM), causes serious damage to wheat throughout the northern hemisphere, and sporadic outbreaks occur in the world. Traits related to diapause appear to be important factors contributing to their rapid spread and outbreak. To better understand the diapause mechanisms of OWBM, we sequenced the transcriptome and determined the gene expression profile of this species. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we performed de novo transcriptome analysis using short-read sequencing technology (Illumina) and gene expression analysis with a tag-based digital gene expression (DGE) system. The sequencing results generated 89, 117 contigs, and 45, 713 unigenes. These unigenes were annotated by Blastx alignment against the NCBI non-redundant (nr), Clusters of orthologous groups (COG), gene orthology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. 20, 802 unigenes (45. 5 % of the total) matched with protein in the NCBI nr database. Two digital gene expression (DGE) libraries were constructed to determine differences in gene expression profiles during diapause and non-diapause developmental stages. Genes related to diapause were analyzed in detail and in addition, nine diapause-related genes were analyzed by real time PCR. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The OWBM transcriptome greatly improves our genetic understanding and provides a platform for functional genomics research of this species. The DGE profiling data provides comprehensive information at the transcriptional level that facilitates our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of various physiological aspects including development and diapause stages in OWBM. From this study it is evident that various genes coding metabolic enzymes are crucial for diapause and metamorphosis...|$|R

To date, only a single characterized midge resistance gene, Sm 1, has been identified. Sm 1 confers antibiosis {{resistance to}} the OWBM. It has been genetically localized to chromosome 2 BS of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Sm 1 has been introgressed into locally adapted germplasm.

The results from each environment were used for quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis at Kernen (SK) in 2009 and 2010, and at Indian Head (SK) in 2009. On average, the presence of Sm 1 was associated with higher grain yield and yellow pigment content, but lower kernel weight, reduced grain protein content, and weaker gluten properties. However, it was possible to identify RIL lines carrying Sm 1 that expressed higher kernel weight, grain protein content, and stronger gluten. A genetic linkage map spanning 58 cM on chromosome 2 B near Sm 1 was constructed. QTL mapping suggested that the total length of the Sm 1 introgression into durum wheat was approximately 11 cM. Nearly all traits measured showed QTLs associated with Sm 1. For grain protein content, a QTL proximal to Sm 1 was identified, suggesting that Sm 1 per se may not be contributing to the reduced grain protein observed in the Sm 1 carriers of the RIL mapping population. The results presented here suggest that on average, Sm 1 is associated with higher grain yield and some reduced end-use quality factors, but that {{it may be possible to}} combine Sm 1 with high grain yield and end-use quality equivalent to current check cultivars...|$|R
