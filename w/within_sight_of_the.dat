5|$|On 2 February 1971 North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces {{launched}} their dry season offensive (Campaign 74B) {{to recapture the}} Plain of Jars. PAVN forces {{taking part in the}} operation included the 316th Division, the 165th Regiment of the 312th Division, the 866th Infantry Regiment, and three sapper battalions (the 13th, 27th, and 41st). Communist forces rolled west and southwest, securing territory in anticipation of a possible cease-fire. By February they had occupied the entire Plain of Jars, Long Tieng had been surrounded, and, {{for the first time since}} 1962, Pathet Lao forces were camped <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal capital of Luang Prabang.|$|E

He led the chase through tangled underbrush until, breaking into prairie, his force {{caught sight of the}} raiding party. The Kickapoo crossed the Pecatonica River <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pursuing militia, and entered into an overgrown swamp. The militia followed across the swollen river and dismounted when they reached the swamp.|$|E

5|$|Alcibiades {{served as}} a {{military}} adviser to Sparta and helped the Spartans secure several crucial successes. He advised them to build a permanent fort at Decelea, just over ten miles (16km) from Athens and <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. By doing this, the Spartans cut the Athenians off entirely {{from their homes and}} crops and the silver mines of Sunium. This was part of Alcibiades's plan to renew the war with Athens in Attica. The move was devastating to Athens and forced the citizens to live within the long walls of the city year round, making them entirely dependent on their seaborne trade for food. Seeing Athens thus beleaguered on a second front, members of the Delian League began to contemplate revolt. In the wake of Athens's disastrous defeat in Sicily, Alcibiades sailed to Ionia with a Spartan fleet and succeeded in persuading several critical cities to revolt.|$|E
5|$|Desiring {{to return}} to the U.S. but still fearing capture, Breckinridge moved his family back to Niagara in June 1868. <b>Within</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. border, he steadfastly refused to seek a pardon, {{although}} 70 members of the Kentucky General Assembly had requested one on his behalf from President Andrew Johnson on February 10, 1866. On January 8, 1868, the Louisville City Council instructed the state's congressional delegation to seek assurance that Breckinridge would not be prosecuted on his return. James Beck, Breckinridge's old law partner, was then in Congress and wrote to him on December 11, 1868, that it appeared likely that Johnson would issue a general pardon for all former Confederates; he advised Breckinridge {{to return to}} the U.S. prior to the pardon being issued because he feared it might only apply to those in the country.|$|E
5|$|However, Red Army {{resistance}} {{had slowed}} the Wehrmacht. When, on 10 October the Germans arrived <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mozhaisk line west of Moscow, they encountered another defensive barrier manned by new Soviet forces. That same day, Georgy Zhukov, {{who had been}} recalled from the Leningrad Front on 6 October, took charge of Moscow's defense and the combined Western and Reserve Fronts, with Colonel General Ivan Konev as his deputy. On 12 October, he ordered the concentration of all available forces on a strengthened Mozhaisk line, a move supported by Vasilevsky. The Luftwaffe still controlled the sky wherever it appeared, and Stuka and bomber groups flew 537 sorties, destroying some 440 vehicles and 150 artillery pieces.|$|E

5|$|In the south, the Second Panzer Army {{initially}} advanced towards Tula {{with relative}} ease because the Mozhaisk defense line {{did not extend}} that far south and no significant concentrations of Soviet troops blocked their advance. However bad weather, fuel problems, and damaged roads and bridges eventually slowed the German army, and Guderian did not reach the outskirts of Tula until 26 October. The German plan initially called for the rapid capture of Tula, followed by a pincer move around Moscow. The first attack, however, was repelled by the 50th Army and civilian volunteers on 29 October, after a fight <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. On 31 October, the German Army high command ordered a halt to all offensive operations until increasingly severe logistical problems were resolved and the rasputitsa subsided.|$|E
5|$|Mason {{had long}} battled against Alexandria merchants who he felt unfairly {{dominated}} the county court, {{if only because}} they could more easily get to the courthouse. In 1789, he drafted legislation to move the courthouse {{to the center of}} the county, though it did not pass in his lifetime. In 1798, the legislature passed an authorizing act, and the courthouse opened in 1801. Most of those at Gunston Hall, both family and slaves, fell ill during the summer of 1792, experiencing chills and fever; when those subsided, Mason caught a chest cold. When Jefferson visited Gunston Hall on October 1, 1792, he found Mason, long a martyr to gout, needing a crutch to walk, though still sound in mind and memory. Additional ailments, possibly pneumonia, set in. Less than a week after Jefferson's visit, on October 7, George Mason died at Gunston Hall, and was subsequently buried on the estate, <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house he had built and of the Potomac River.|$|E
5|$|Near the Ellipse, and <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White House, {{the hearse}} halted and Reagan's body was {{transferred}} to a horse-drawn caisson for the procession down Constitution Avenue to Capitol Hill. Nancy Reagan stepped out of her limousine to witness the body's transfer; she was met with a warm greeting, including applause. The cortege began the 45-minute journey just after 6:00pm EST, with the Reagan family following in limousines. Military units escorted the caisson as it {{made its way to}} the sounds of muffled drums. Behind the caisson was a riderless horse named Sergeant York, carrying Reagan's riding boots reversed in the stirrups. The caisson paused at 4th Street and Constitution Avenue, where 21 Air Force F-15's from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, flew over in missing man formation.|$|E

5|$|Reconstructing a {{timetable}} for {{the day of the}} battle is tentative due to ambiguous statements in Ammianus (which may have been caused by manuscript copying-errors). It appears that Julian's army set forth at dawn, and apparently arrived <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barbarian entrenchments (vallum) outside Strasbourg at around midday, after a march of 21 Roman miles. (A contradictory statement in Julian's speech implies that the army was still far off its destination and faced a night march to reach it. But this is incompatible with all the other available data and should thus probably be disregarded). The starting-point was probably Saverne, since this is the last stated location of Julian's army, and it lay a consistent distance from Strasbourg on the Roman highway.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 18 October 1806 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} Napoleonic Wars, fought between the British Royal Navy frigate HMS Caroline and a Dutch squadron {{at the entrance to}} Batavia harbour on Java in the Dutch East Indies. During the battle the Dutch frigate Maria Riggersbergen was left unsupported by the remainder of the squadron and, isolated, was forced to surrender. Captain Peter Rainier, the British commander, was subsequently free to remove his prize from <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch port when the remainder of the Dutch squadron refused to engage Caroline and their crews deliberately grounded the ships to avoid capture. He also returned many prisoners taken previously in a captured brig.|$|E
5|$|The polyptych was {{commissioned}} to provide both comfort and {{warning to the}} dying. It was intended to remind them of their faith, and direct their last thoughts towards the divine. This is evident in its positioning in the chapel, within view of the patients' beds. Rolin specified that 30 beds be placed <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> altarpiece for those too ill to walk, where it was visible to them through a pierced screen. There were usually only two patients per bed, luxurious {{at a time when}} six to fifteen in a large bed was more common. Medical care was expensive and primitive in the 15th century; the spiritual care of patients was as important as the treatment of physical ailments.|$|E

5|$|The {{secondary}} {{engagement of}} the battle was contested initially <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other combatants, Persanne firing the first shots at the pursuing Unite at 12:30. The smaller size of these vessels made them faster and more manoeuvrable than their larger counterparts, {{and as a result}} it was not until 16:00 that Unite caught the smaller ship. During the pursuit, the ships had exchanged long-range shots from their stern and bow guns which caused six casualties aboard Unite but none on Persanne. From external appearances, Persanne seemed to be a frigate of similar size to the fifth rate Unite, but in fact the French ship was only lightly armed, carrying 26 small guns to her opponent's 36. As a result, {{when it became clear that}} his ship could not outrun Unite, Captain Satie surrendered after firing a token broadside rather than be destroyed by the more powerful ship.|$|E
5|$|When Hillyar's {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} Port Louis, Captain Schomberg immediately assumed command {{and led the}} squadron out again on 14 May, following the French eastwards. Heading straight for Tamatave, the only resupply point between Bourbon and the Cape of Good Hope, Schomberg rapidly gained on the French and when dawn broke on 20 May the French were <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> harbour. During the day, both commanders were frustrated by light winds and periods of calm in which none of the ships were able to move. Roquebert completed resupplying his ships at 12:00 and {{pulled away from the}} harbour in battle line, Clorinde followed by Renommée and Néréide while the British, although initially intending to form a line with Astraea at its head, gradually broke into a loose formation created by the vagaries of the wind.|$|E
5|$|When the Southern Pawnees {{arrived in}} Nebraska, the Skidis were not {{pleased to see}} them on lands that they {{regarded}} as their own. Nevertheless, they were willing to accept them as neighbors, so long as they kept to {{the south side of the}} Platte. However, the Chaui leaders demanded that they be recognized as the heads of the entire Pawnee people, above the Skidi chiefs. They defied the Skidis by sending a large hunting party to Prairie Creek, on the north side of the Platte <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Skidi villages on the Loup. The Skidis responded by attacking the Chaui hunters and driving them back across the Platte. The Chauis and Pitahawiratas resolved on war, and summoned the Kitkehahki fighters to join them against the Skidis; the Kitkehahkis, unwilling to leave their people unprotected against Skidi raids, left the Republican and moved to the Platte near the other bands.|$|E

5|$|Departing Toulon on 19 May, Bonaparte's fleet {{passed along}} the coast of Provence to Genoa, where 72 {{additional}} transport ships were collected. Sailing south, the fleet reached Corsica on 23 May and collected a fleet of 22 transports from Ajaccio on 28 May. The convoy remained <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern coastline until 30 May, crossing the Strait of Bonifacio and following the coastline of Sardinia in anticipation of combining with fleets of transports sailing from Civitavecchia. On 3 June, a message reached Bonaparte reporting the presence of Nelson's squadron at San Pietro and the French general sent a French squadron to investigate, although by that time Nelson had sailed and the harbour was empty. Abandoning the wait for the Civitavecchia force, which had still not arrived, Bonaparte gave orders for his fleet to turn southeast, passing Mazara on Sicily and the island of Pantelleria on 7 June. There a report from a captured British merchant brig warned Bonaparte that Nelson was only a short distance behind his force with a powerful Royal Navy fleet and, concerned for his transports, Bonaparte gave urgent orders for the French fleet to steer for Malta, arriving off Valletta at 05:30 on 9 June, shortly after uniting with the 56 ships of the Civitavecchia convoy, which had missed the rendezvous and continued to Malta alone.|$|E
5|$|In February 1800, a {{significant}} convoy under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Perrée sent from Toulon made a determined effort to resupply the garrison. The blockade squadron under Rear-Admiral Lord Nelson intercepted the convoy <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> starving troops on Malta. Perrée {{was killed and}} his flagship captured in the ensuing, but brief Battle of the Malta Convoy (1800). The following month, the ship of the line Guillaume Tell set sail from Valletta to Toulon, laden with soldiers, but this too was intercepted and in a hard-fought battle was forced to surrender to a larger British squadron. These defeats rendered the French position on Valletta untenable, and its surrender inevitable. Although Vaubois held out for another five months, he eventually surrendered on 4 September, by which time the garrison mortality from malnourishment and typhus had reached 100 men a day. Malta was retained by Britain, {{and control of the}} island was a factor in the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803. Ultimately it remained under British government for 164 years, gaining independence in 1964.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the Arab siege led to a {{profound}} change {{in the nature of}} warfare between Byzantium and the Caliphate. The Muslim goal of conquest of Constantinople was effectively abandoned, and the frontier between the two empires stabilized along the line of the Taurus and Antitaurus Mountains, over which both sides continued to launch regular raids and counter-raids. In this incessant border warfare, frontier towns and fortresses changed hands frequently, but the general outline of the border remained unaltered for over two centuries, until the Byzantine conquests of the 10th century. The eastern fleets of the Caliphate entered a century-long decline; only the Ifriqiyan fleets maintained regular raids on Byzantine Sicily, until they too subsided after 752. Indeed, {{with the exception of the}} advance of the Abbasid army under Harun al-Rashid up to Chrysopolis in 782, no other Arab army would ever come <b>within</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine capital again. Consequently, on the Muslim side the raids themselves eventually acquired an almost ritual character, and were valued mostly as a demonstration of the continuing jihad and sponsored by the Caliph as a symbol of his role as the leader of the Muslim community.|$|E
