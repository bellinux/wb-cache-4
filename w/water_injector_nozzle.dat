40|$|A eficiência de coleta e os gastos de implantação e operação são os principais fatores considerados na utilização de equipamentos para a separação de {{material}} particulado no gás. O ciclone é comumente empregado industrialmente por apresentar baixos custos, entretanto o seu uso é restrito devido à baixa eficiência na coleta de partículas menores que 5 &# 956;m. O incremento do ciclone convencional com bicos injetores de água proporcionou uma melhoria na sua eficiência de coleta. Neste trabalho foi investigado experimentalmente o desempenho de um ciclone úmido na remoção de rocha fosfática com diâmetro mediano de 4, 66 &# 956;m. Foram instalados 8 bicos injetores de água do tipo leque. As concentrações de particulado na entrada e na saída do equipamento foram obtidas através da amostragem isocinética. Variou-se a relação da vazão de líquido/gás (L/G) de 0, 65 a 2, 20 L/m 3 para 3 diferentes configurações de bicos. A temperatura na saída diminuiu em relação à entrada em função do aumento da razão L/G. Já a umidade relativa do gás aumentou conforme o aumento da razão L/G. O ciclone operando a seco apresentou eficiência média de 76, 7 % e a melhor eficiência média a úmido foi de 85, 3 %. Foi determinada a eficiência de coleta fracionária apenas para a condição operacional que resultou na melhor eficiência global. A adaptação do ciclone Stairmand com bicos injetores de água resultou em uma melhoria de 8, 6 % na eficiência global de coleta. The {{collection efficiency}} {{and costs of}} implementation and operation are the main factors considered {{in the use of}} equipment for the separation of particulate matter in the gas. The cyclone is commonly employed industrially by low costs, however its use is limited due to the low efficiency in collecting particles smaller than 5 &# 956;m. The increase of conventional cyclone with nozzles water led to an improvement in its collection efficiency. This work experimentally investigated the performance of a wet cyclone in the removal of phosphate rock with median diameter of 4. 66 &# 956;m. The cyclone was adapted with 8 <b>water</b> <b>injectors</b> <b>nozzles</b> of range type. The concentrations of particles in the entrance and exit of equipment were obtained by isokinetic sampling. The ratio of the flow of liquid / gas (L/G) was varied from 0. 65 to 2. 20 L/m 3 to 3 different nozzle configurations. The outlet temperature decreased compared to entry with increase of the ratio L/G. Have the relative humidity of the gas increased with increasing L/G. The cyclone dry operating had an average efficiency of 76. 7 % and the best average efficiency the wet was 85. 3 %. The fractional collection efficiency was determined only for the operating condition that resulted in the best overall efficiency.

This has included the implementation of high pressure common rail fuel systems employing high precision injectors with complex injection strategies, higher hydraulic efficiency <b>injector</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{and in some cases}} < 100 µm nozzle hole diameters. With the trend towards lower diameter diesel <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle</b> holes and reduced cleaning through cavitation with higher hydraulic efficiency nozzles, it is increasingly important to focus on understanding the mechanism of diesel <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle</b> deposit formation and growth.

40|$|Effective fuel {{injector}} operation and efficient combustion {{are two of}} the most critical aspects when Diesel engine performance, efficiency and reliability are considered. Indeed, it is widely acknowledged that fuel injection equipment faults lead to increased fuel consumption, reduced power, greater levels of exhaust emissions and even unexpected engine failure. Previous investigations have identified {{fuel injector}} related acoustic emission activity as being caused by mechanisms such as fuel line pressure build-up; fuel flow through <b>injector</b> <b>nozzles,</b> <b>injector</b> needle opening and closing impacts and premixed combustion related pulses.

A flat wall vertical to the injector axis is located 30 Â mm away from the <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle</b> tip to generate impinging spray flame. Three injection pressures of 100, 200 and 300 Â MPa and two <b>injector</b> <b>nozzles</b> with diameters of 0. 16 and 0. 08 Â mm were used. With the conventional <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle</b> (0. 16 Â mm), ultra-high injection pressure generates appreciably lower soot formation. With the micro-hole nozzle (0. 08 Â mm), impinging spray flame shows much smaller size and lower soot formation at the injection pressure of 100 Â MPa. The soot formation is too weak to be detected with the micro-hole nozzle at injection pressures of 200 and 300 Â MPa. With eliminating the impact of injection rate on soot level, both ultra-high injection pressure and micro-hole nozzle have an obvious effect on soot reduction. Soot formation characteristics of impinging spray flame were compared with those of free spray flame using both the conventional and micro-hole nozzles. With the conventional nozzle, flat wall impingement deteriorates soot formation significantly. While soot formation characteristics of free spray flame with the micro-hole nozzle are not altered obviously by flat wall. Liquid length of the 0. 16 mm nozzle is longer than the impingement distance and liquid length of the 0. 08 Â mm nozzle is shorter than the impingement distance.

Under running condition, deposit precursors are washed {{away by the}} ensuing injection. However, during the cool down process after engine shut down, fuel, detergent chemistry, and fluid transport (evaporation) compete to determine the magnitude of deposit. This project involves numerical modeling and simulation of these processes. by Chintoo Sudhiesh Kumar. Thesis (S. M.)

An {{essential}} component of the <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle</b> geometry is {{to see the results}} spray atomization and mixture formation of the fuel-air combustion to improve performance, and reduce pollution from a burner. Studies involving the injectors in the combustion burner are still in a small proportion, particularly in the premix injector type. Thus, this study involves the efforts to determine the appropriate diameter of the premix injector where the injector sprays characteristics is produced by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Multiphase of the volume of fluid (VOF) cavitations flow in the nozzle is determined through steady simulation while Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid approach is used for performing mixing of Jatropha oil and air. Further simulation is conducted using a spray with a discrete phase injection at the outflow hole <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The investigation involves the modification of nozzle geometry on three different sizes of 0. 8 mm, 1. 0 mm and 1. 5 mm with the analysis focused on nozzle flow characteristics of the injector. The results indicate that a small changes in injector gives high impact to the spray and combustion of a burner. This shows the importance of nozzle dimensions which influences the nozzle flow and affects the spray characteristics, hence influence the combustion and emission of the burner system...|$|R

This research aims to study the effect of <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle</b> geometry on mixture and internal combustion efficiency in four stroke automotive engine which operates using hydrogen fuel. The research will concentrate on two aspects, namely the inflow and outflow profile of the <b>injector</b> <b>nozzle.</b> For each flow profile, the effect of geometrical design of the nozzle on the parameter such as flow velocity, fuel penetration distance, average mass fuel consumption and diffusion will be studied in detail. In this study, numerical simulation analysis was done by using the computing fluid dynamics (CFD) software, Star-CCM+. Models comprise of multiple orifice nozzle geometry with single angle orifice and double angle orifice was developed with CAD software. A suitable design for a better mixing nozzle would then be determined. Nozzle which possesses {{a high number of}} orifice and a smaller diameter will result in a higher flow velocity in the cavity nozzle channel. Geometry of nozzle with different angle of orifice was found to be the most suitable due to the low flow penetration distance and fuel consumption as well as combustion enhancement by the diffusion rate...|$|R
