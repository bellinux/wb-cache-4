5|$|But when he contested {{the first}} World Championship match in 1886 against Johannes Zukertort, it became evident that Steinitz was playing on another level. Although Zukertort <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> Steinitz's equal in {{spectacular}} attacking play, Steinitz often outmaneuvered him fairly simply {{by the use}} of positional principles.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{speculation}} that the assassination of Spanish prime minister Antonio Cánovas del Castillo by Italian anarchist Michele Angiolillo in 1897 <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> supported or influenced by Betances, and possibly even planned by him (although there is no physical link that can be established that might link Betances to the event itself).|$|E

During his stay in Transylvania, Nicholas Alexanderwho was the son of Basarab, the ruling prince of Wallachiaswore loyalty to Louis on his father's behalf in Brassó (now Brașov in Romania); thus the suzerainty of the Hungarian monarchs over Wallachia <b>was,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> outwardly, restored.|$|E
5|$|Although {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} a biped, {{it has been suggested}} since the mid-1970s that Spinosaurus <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> an occasional quadruped. This has been bolstered by the discovery of Baryonyx, a relative with robust arms. Because of the mass of the hypothesized fatty dorsal humps of Spinosaurus, Bailey (1997) was open to the possibility of a quadrupedal posture, leading to new restorations of it as such. The hypothesis that Spinosaurus had a typical quadrupedal gait has fallen out of favor, though spinosaurids may have crouched in a quadrupedal posture.|$|E

5|$|Beauchamp left Bowling Green {{to live at}} his father's {{plantation}} in Simpson County, Kentucky, {{where he}} convalesced from an illness. He learned that Cooke had become a recluse nearby at her mother's plantation after her public disgrace. Having heard from a mutual friend about her beauty and accomplishments, he decided to meet Cooke. At first, she rejected all attention, but gradually received Beauchamp under his guise of borrowing books from her library. The two eventually became friends, and, in 1821, began courting. Beauchamp was eighteen years old; Cooke <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> thirty-four.|$|E

Beauchamp was eighteen; Cooke <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> thirty-four. As the courtship progressed, Cooke told Beauchamp that, before they could be married, he would have to kill Solomon Sharp. Beauchamp agreed to her request, expressing his own desire to dispatch Sharp.|$|E

Goldman later speculated that her father's furious temper <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> partly a result of sexual frustration.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} the jet stream <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> {{partly responsible for}} the widespread drought conditions during the 1930s Dust Bowl in the Midwest United States. Normally, the jet stream flows east over the Gulf of Mexico and turns northward pulling up moisture and dumping rain onto the Great Plains. During the Dust Bowl, the jet stream weakened and changed course traveling farther south than normal. This starved the Great Plains and other areas of the Midwest of rainfall, causing extraordinary drought conditions.|$|E
