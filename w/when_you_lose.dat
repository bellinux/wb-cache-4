500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] {{are about a}} gender-swapping thought experiment, through which Beyoncé {{analyses}} the ideologies of a tense relationship. As she sings about things she would do {{if she were a}} boy, Beyoncé highlights the vulnerability of a woman and ponders how things would be different if men had women's sense of empathy. During {{the first part of the}} ballad, Beyoncé alternates between the role of her flawed partner and that of the better man she would be. In the first verse, she envisions herself impersonating her unfeeling love interest as she sings about consuming beer with other men, chasing after girls, and treating her lover cruelly, before adding that she would never be confronted for it. Beyoncé then sings the chorus, in which she gives her vision of life as a better man, [...] "I think I could understand / How it feels to love a girl / I swear I'd be a better man", because she knows [...] "how it hurts <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> the one you wanted / 'cause he's taken you for granted and everything you had got destroyed".|$|E

[...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be. The whole idea is that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E

During a phone call to Kitase, it was suggested that {{at some point in the}} game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura stated in a 2005 Electronic Gaming Monthly interview: [...] "Cloud's the main character, so you can't really kill him. And Barrett... well, that's maybe too obvious." [...] While designing Final Fantasy VII, Nomura was frustrated with the [...] "perennial cliché where the protagonist loves someone very much and so has to sacrifice himself and die in a dramatic fashion to express that love." [...] He found this trope appeared in both films and video games from North America and Japan, and asked [...] "Is it right to set such an example to people?" [...] Kitase concluded: [...] "In the real world things are very different. You just need to look around you. Nobody wants to die that way. People die of disease and accident. Death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or bad. It leaves, not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> someone you loved very much you feel this big empty space and think, 'If I had known this was coming I would have done things differently.' These are the feelings I wanted to arouse in the players with Aerith's death relatively early in the game. Feelings of reality and not Hollywood." ...|$|E
