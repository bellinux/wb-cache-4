5|$|At first, the laborers {{walked the}} seven {{kilometers}} from Auschwitz I {{to the plant}} each day, but as this meant they had to rise at 03:00, many arrived exhausted and unable to work. The camp at Monowitz (also called Monowitz-Buna or Auschwitz III) was constructed and began housing inmates on 30 October 1942, the first concentration camp to be financed and built by private industry. In January 1943 the ArbeitsausbildungLager (labor education camp) was moved from the parent camp to Monowitz. These prisoners were also forced {{to work on the}} building site. The SS charged IG Farben three Reichsmarks per hour for unskilled workers, four for skilled workers. Although the camp administrators expected the prisoners to work at 75 percent of the capacity of a free worker, the inmates were only able to perform 20 to 50 percent as well. Site managers constantly threatened inmates with transportation to Birkenau for death in the gas chambers as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> increase productivity. Deaths and transfers to the gas chambers at Birkenau reduced the prisoner population of Monowitz by nearly a fifth each month; numbers were made up with new arrivals. Life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged about three months. Though the factory had been expected to begin production in 1943, shortages of labor and raw materials meant start-up had to be postponed repeatedly. The plant was almost ready to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Podemos' {{referendum}} among {{party members}} aroused interest {{as it was}} seen as critical for any PSOE-led government to be formed before the 2 May deadline. Party leaders expected to use the vote as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> pressure the PSOE into {{coming to terms with}} them, but the unexpectedly high turnout in the 14–16 April period attracted media attention as it exceeded the one obtained in the 27 February PSOE referendum and even Podemos' turnout records in similar internal votes. The vote resulted in Podemos' membership massively rejecting the PSOE–C's pact and supporting a PSOE–Podemos–Compromís–IU alliance, as proposed by Podemos' leadership.|$|E

25|$|When {{the crisis}} loomed, one <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> avert {{it was to}} simply start {{reducing}} the interest paid on discretionary and demand deposits. But {{such a move would}} have hurt the Medici name, and so it was undertaken too late. The bank's heavy leverage of their deposits meant that setbacks could be quite sudden. The fact that it {{seems to have been a}} common practice for Florentine banks to operate with as little as 5% of their deposits held in reserve lends further support to the idea that collapses could happen abruptly when bad loans were discovered. In addition to all of that, Lorenzo the Magnificent was not at all concerned about the bank. Instead, he chose to concentrate his time and his family's resources on patronizing artists and pursuing his own poetic and political interests.|$|E
25|$|In South America, Argentina was {{the first}} country to produce it, with Marisol Otero as Belle, Juan Rodó as Beast, Diego Jaraz as Gaston, Gustavo Monje as LeFou, Pablo Lizaso as Lumière, Mónica Nuñez as Mrs. Potts, Omar Pini as Cogsworth, Alejandra Radano as Babette and Rodolfo Valss as Maurice. It ran from November 26, 1998, at the Teatro Ópera in Buenos Aires until August 15, 1999, before opening again in 2010. Brazil was the second country to host the musical. Disney had plans {{to bring it to}} the country in 1999, after the success in Argentina, but nobody really knew if it would work. Three years later, in 2002, Beauty and the Beast finally opened in Brazil at Teatro Abril, one of the biggest theaters in the country. It was a huge hit, for more than one and a half years, it was {{presented}} with Kiara Sasso playing Belle and Saulo Vasconcelos playing the Beast. In 2009, a new Belle and a new Beast were cast, Lissah Martins and Ricardo Vieira, as the musical came back to Brazil, Kiara Sasso was playing Maria in The Sound of Music. Beauty and the Beast remained for six months at Teatro Abril. Even though the play was brought back as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> recoup some of the money lost in Brazil's version of Miss Saigon, this second incarnation of Beauty and the Beast failed to create any critical buzz, or to be a box office success.|$|E

Chuck goes on his <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> regain Bass Industries from his father who stole it from him while Blair tries to find herself and her individuality by taking over her mother’s company at her mother's request. Serena pursues a relationship with someone older and who happens to have a 17-year-old daughter, Sage who {{will do anything to}} try to split them up. Nate focuses on trying to get the Spectator to become successful and dates Sage. Meanwhile, Dan focuses on completing his second book with Georgina’s help. In the end after a surprising turn of events Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) and Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) get married. In the final moments the series speeds forward five years later where Chuck and Blair are revealed to have had a child and Nate Archibald appears successful and is rumored to be running for Mayor of New York. The show ends with the wedding of Serena van der Woodsen and Dan Humphrey. It's a small ceremony, in what looks like Blair and Chuck's home together, where Lily is with Serena and Eric's father, William, and Rufus seems to be happy with another woman (musician Lisa Loeb, who guest-starred in the first season) along with Dorota, Nate, Jack Bass and Georgina (who are now together), Jenny and Eric. A brief shot of The Spectator reveals that Lola Rhodes and Olivia Burke are now starring in a film about Ivy Dickens, based on her best-selling autobiography.|$|E

2500|$|The Japanese {{went out}} of their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> ensure that Manchukuo was the {{embodiment}} of modernity in all of its aspects as Manchukuo was intended to prove to the world what the Asian peoples could accomplish if they worked together. Manchukuo's legal system was based upon the Organic Law of 1932, which featured a 12 article Human Rights Protection Law and a supposedly independent judiciary to enforce the law. The official ideology of Manchukuo was the wangdao ("Kingly Way") devised by a former mandarin under the Qing turned Prime Minister of Manchukuo Zheng Xiaoxu calling for an ordered Confucian society that would promote justice and harmony that was billed at the time as {{the beginning of a new}} era in world history. The purpose of the law in Manchukuo was not the protection of the rights of the individual as the wangdao ideology was expressly hostile towards individualism, which was seen as a decadent Western concept inimical to Asia, but rather the interests of the state by ensuring that subjects fulfilled their duties to the emperor. The wangdao favored the collective over the individual, as the wangdao called for all people to put the needs of society ahead of their own needs. Zheng together with the Japanese legal scholar Ishiwara Kanji in a joint statement attacked the Western legal tradition for promoting individualism, which they claimed led to selfishness, greed and materialism, and argued that the wangdao with its disregard for the individual was a morally superior system. The seemingly idealistic Human Rights Protection Law counterbalanced the [...] "rights" [...] of the subjects with their [...] "responsibilities" [...] to the state with a greater emphasis on the latter, just as was the case in Japan. The wangdao promoted Confucian morality and spirituality, which was seen as coming down from the Emperor Puyi, and as such the legal system existed to serve the needs of the state headed by Emperor Puyi, who could change the laws as he saw fit. In this regard it is noteworthy that Legislative Yuan had only the power of assisting the Emperor with making laws, being endowed with far less powers than even the Imperial Diet in Japan had, which had the power to reject or approve laws. It was often suggested at the time that the Legislative Yuan of Manchukuo was a model for the Imperial Diet in Japan, an idea the Showā Emperor was sympathetic to, but never took up. The Showa Emperor in the end preferred the Meiji constitution passed by his grandfather in 1889 as it gave the Emperor of Japan ultimate power while at the same time the fiction of the Imperial Diet together with a Prime Minister and his cabinet governing Japan gave the Emperor a scapegoat when things went wrong.|$|E
