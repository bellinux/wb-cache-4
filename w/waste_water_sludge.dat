The apparent viscosity was related to absolute temperature by an equation in the form = A. e b/T. While the constant A varies with both solid content and strain rate, the activation energy at constant strain rate is independent of solid volume fraction.

40|$|The {{homogeniser}} is {{a machine}} that is mostly used to change the appearance and rheological properties of a fluid {{by means of a}} high pressure radial gap. It can be implemented to kill off harmful bacteria and organisms as well as reduce the size of individual components or particles to increase the shelf live of many products. The homogeniser can be used to release useful organic materials from within cells or microbes. The homogeniser can be found in small scale production and large scale production. The small scale production homogeniser allows smaller gap sizes but is restricted to lower flow rates in relation to the larger scale homogeniser. The primary aim of this thesis is to determine optimum geometries for the small-scale high-pressure homogeniser in the disruption of anaerobic microbes from <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> <b>sludge</b> to release organic material to produce methane with maize crop. It is believed that breaking apart microbial walls of microbes in the sludge can release organic material that can further increase methane production and also reduce digester volume. In this case, the <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> <b>sludge</b> with microbes was implemented with a mixture of dry maize silage to produce methane by means of anaerobic conditions. The homogeniser is used to break up tough microbes in secondary <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> <b>sludge</b> to reduce digester volume and anaerobic methane production waiting times. Geometries of the homogeniser and prototypes were generated using Gambit 2. 3. Pressure, velocity and flow fields were estimated and analysed using Fluent 6. 3. The model was estimated by means of a stationary microbe model. Shear forces on microbes were analysed for various positions along the streamline of flow and compared. The homogeniser setup with the highest peak shear forces was used as an optimum homogeniser setup. The initial homogeniser model was replicated from the original experimental homogeniser in the lab. Model simulations were validated from empirical formulae from other works. The optimised design made use of a 27. 8 ˚ inlet chamfer with the valve gap chamfer diverging at 2. 5 ˚ each side (valve seat and valve head) downstream of the valve beginning.

Zajema opis odpadne vode, virov in njenih lastnosti ter predstavlja postopek čiščenja z aktivnim blatom, proces flokulacije in uporabo različnih polielektrolitov pri procesu dehidracije blata. V preliminarnih poskusih, ki smo jih izvedli na ČN Ptuj, smo s spreminjanjem pretoka na centrifugi preverili, kako omenjena sprememba vpliva na vsebnost suhe snovi v odpadnem aktivnem blatu. Izvedli smo tudi primerjavo med JAR-testom in ročnim mešanjem pri doziranju polielektrolitov. Namen magistrske naloge je bil preveriti vpliv dodatka različnih polielektrolitov, s katerimi smo želeli zvišati vsebnost suhe snovi v odpadnem blatu. ČN Ptuj uporablja polielektrolit Acefloc 80902 +. S preverjanjem učinkovitih polielektrolitov smo preverili, ali lahko povečamo vsebnost suhe snovi v odpadnem aktivnem blatu z uporabo različnih polielektrolitov. Pri tem smo uporabili različne polielektrolite, ki smo jih dobili s strani različnih proizvajalcev. Preizkusili smo tekoče in prašnate polielektrolite, ki smo jih dozirali odpadnemu aktivnemu blatu v različnih količinah. Določili smo optimalne koncentracije polielektrolitov, ki bi bili primerni za dosego čim večjega deleža suhe snovi v dehidriranem blatu. Po filtraciji blata (supernatanta) smo določili naslednje parametre: TOC, pH, prevodnost, alkaliteto in motnost. Na podlagi analiz smo ugotovili, kateri izmed polielektrolitov daje najbolj zadovoljive rezultate. Za najučinkovitejše polielektrolite smo naredili ekonomsko analizo in predlagali, kateri polielektrolit bi bilo smiselno uvesti na ČN Ptuj. This master’s thesis {{dealt with}} the {{problematic}} of waste water treatment by using the conventional cleaning process with activated sludge. Furthermore, waste waters, its sources and characteristics are described, {{as well as the}} cleaning process with activated sludge, the process of flocculation and the application of different polyelectrolytes in the process of sludge dehydration. Through variations of the flowrate at the separator within the preliminary tests at the waste water treatment plant in Ptuj, we have examined how these changes influenced the dry matter content in the waste activated sludge. In addition, a comparison between the JAR-test and the manual mixing regarding the dosing of polyelectrolytes was carried out. The purpose of this master’s thesis was to establish the impact of different polyelectrolytes additions to increase the dry matter content in the <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> <b>sludge.</b> The waste water treatment plant in Ptuj uses the Acefloc 80902 + polyelectrolyte. By examining the effective polyelectrolytes, it was determined, if {{it would be possible to}} increase the dry matter content in the <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> <b>sludge</b> with the application of different polyelectrolytes. As a result, those various polyelectrolytes, supplied by different producers, were applied. Moreover, polyelectrolytes in liquid and powder form were fed into the waste activated sludge in varying amounts. Optimum concentrations of polyelectrolytes suitable to achieve the highest possible dry matter content in the <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> <b>sludge</b> were determined. After sludge (supernatant) filtration, parameters were set as follows: TOC, pH, conductivity, alkalinity and turbidity.

The studied composts were character-ized by basic pH, mostly over pH 9, and an EC value ranging from 1. 6 to 3. 6 mS/cm. Organic matter (OM) and C/N ratio of composts ranged from 20 % to 46 % and 10 % to 21 % respectively. The biological stability of composts was evaluated by measuring cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin and Weende cellulose contents {{as well as by}} calculating Biological Stability Index (BSI). The BSI ranged from 0. 13 to 1. 31. Phytotoxicity of composts was studied by determining cress seed germination in mixtures of relative compost and peat.

40|$|The {{importance}} of syntrophic relationships among microorganisms participating in biogas formation has been emphasized, and the regulatory role of in situ hydrogen production has been recognized. It {{was assumed that}} the availability of hydrogen may be a limiting factor for hydrogenotrophic methanogens.

The process was tested in a 5 -m(3) thermophilic biogas digester using pig manure slurry as a substrate. Biogas formation increased at least 160 - 170 % upon addition of the hydrogen-producing bacteria as compared to the biogas production of the spontaneously formed microbial consortium. Using the hydrogenase-minus control strain provided evidence that the observed enhancement was due to interspecies hydrogen transfer.

40|$|Disposal of urban, {{agricultural}} and industrial organic residues implies an increasing problem {{because of all}} the economic and environmental repercussions involved. One of the most adequate ways of managing this problem is the agricultural use of these wastes as organic amendments. Three organic residues (AC, olive mill <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> <b>sludge</b> compost; MWC, municipal solid waste compost; and PS, paper mill sludge) were used in a 3 -year field experiment involving orange production. The effect of their application on crop production and on soil quality was investigated. Soil samples (0 - 20 cm depth) collected 11 months after the last soil amendment were analysed for: pH and EC, Kjeldahl-N, available-P, available-K, total organic carbon, humic substances, dehydrogenase, phosphatase, β-glucosidase, urease and benzoyl-argininamide hydrolysing protease (BAA-protease) activities. Generally, the application of the MWC and PS increased orange yield when compared to control. Moreover, total organic carbon and humic substances significantly increased in soils treated with all the organic amendments. Organic fertilisation increased the Kjeldahl-N and available-P contents of the soil. The application of the organic residues also caused significant increases in dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, urease and BAA-protease activities of the soil. Significant positive correlations (p < 0. 01) between these enzymatic activities and total organic carbon were found for all treatments. Significant positive correlation between dehydrogenase, urease, β-glucosidase, and BAA-protease and orange yield was also found. However, a clear inhibition of phosphatase activity was observed in soils treated with PS. The results indicate that the repeated application to the soil of moderate amounts of organic amendments has positive effects on the chemical and biochemical properties of the soil, {{as well as on the}} orange yield.

40|$|Water {{treatment}} {{companies and}} other actors in Sweden are concerned over the potential {{contamination of the}} <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> <b>sludge</b> due to silver emissions originating from antibacterial applications, such as clothes treated with silver {{in order to reduce}} odour. Silver is a compound which is known for its toxicity to several organisms. Hence, increased silver concentration in sludge may therefore prevent the sludge from being used as fertilizer on agricultural land, hence preventing the recycling of nutrients. Therefore, an environmental risk assessment of silver in clothes was conducted for the case of the waste water treatment plant Ryaverket in Gothenburg. Emissions of silver from washing as function of consumption of silver-containing clothes was estimated, the fate of silver in waste water treatment plants and soil was studied, and finally a review was made regarding silver toxicity to soil organisms. The potential concentration of silver in sludge and soil was estimated and benchmarked against different guideline values. The risk assessment reveals a very large variation in silver concentration in clothes, ranging from 0. 003 mg/kg up to 1400 mg/kg. This wide range of about six orders of magnitude of course affects the potential concentration of silver in sludge and soil. If silver concentrations close to 1400 mg/kg are to be used in clothes, the current silver concentration in the sludge from Ryaverket could easily become doubled, and if that sludge was to be applied on soil, the silver may accumulate and cause long-term damage to soil ecosystems. However, if silver concentrations close to 0. 003 mg/kg are to be used in clothes, it would not constitute a risk to sludge or soil considering the low amounts of silver. Also, the future consumption of silver-containing clothes may vary and will {{have a significant effect on}} the results. The recommendation based on this study is either to limit silver concentration in clothes or the consumption of silver-containing clothes if environmental impacts are to be avoided...|$|E

Other metals such as cerium and copper was also included. The study {{is part of the}} national environmental monitoring program run by the Swedish EPA. The major goals of the study were: q To provide new data on the environmental levels of platinum groups elements and silver in urban and background areas in Sweden through analysis of sediments, surface water, stormwater, <b>waste</b> <b>water,</b> <b>sludge</b> and fish. q To assess whether levels are higher in urban areas compared to rural areas. q To assess whether there are indications of time trends. q To assess human exposure. The study consists of a national programme (60 samples) and three regional programs (14 samples). Major matrices were sediments and urine. There were no pronounced indications that background lakes were affected by anthropogenic emissions of Pt, Pd or Rh. For silver, sediment concentrations indicate a possible increase in background lakes over the last decade or two. Data is however too limited to state this as a general phenomenon. To elicudate possible emission sources analyses were performed on stormwater, urban runoff pond sediments, sewage sludge and waste water effluents. Platinum, Rh and Pd were enriched in stormwaters and runoff pond sediments, in agreement with road traffic as a major emission source of these metals. Data also consistently show that muncipal waste waters were enriched in Pt relative to the composition of stormwaters. The medical use of Pt is a suggested explanation. In ten recipients affected by urban emissions or road traffic, sediment levels of Pd, Pt, Rh and Ag were generally higher than background levels. The platinum group elements (PGE) profile in these sediments were compared to the profiles for waste water effluent and stormwaters, respectively. Although several of these recipients were recipients to municipal waste water treatment plants, most sediments show profiles similar to stormwater. This indicates that vehicle catalysts still is the major source of Pt, Pd and Rh to these recipients. Surface water and fish were also analysed from a few of these urban recipients. Palladium concentrations were detected in urban surface waters, but neither Pt, Rh nor Ag were detected. Fish (perch) from these sites did not display concentrations of Pd, Pt or Rh above the analytical reporting limit. Silver in these fish samples occurred in similar or lower concentrations than in the background lakes. To assess time trends, fish from background lakes sampled in 1985, 2000 and 2014 were analysed. Furthermore sediment from both background lakes and urban lakes were analysed at several depths, corresponding to at least the last 2 - 3 decades. Overall there were no indications of pronounced time trends. None of the PGEs were detected in human urine from 20 individuals, except for two observations of platinum. Silver was detected in ca 50 % of the urine samples and levels were similar to a 15 year old study. The overall assessment of the data in this study is that neither Pt, Pd, Rh nor Ag give rise to a concern for ecotoxicological effects. It should though be considered that although some ecotoxicological data exist, effect criteria for the PGEs have not been established and the monitoring data presented are limited...|$|E
40|$|Annually, {{large amounts}} wasted {{activated}} sludge {{are produced by}} municipal waste water treatment plants (WWTP’s). In the Netherlands annually ± 353 thousand tons of sludge is produced (Henze, et al. 2008). Due to strict regulations regarding the disposal of heavy metals on agricultural lands and corresponding risks of diseases spreading, it {{is not allowed to}} use wastewater sludge as fertilizer for agricultural purposes (Cimochowicz-Rybicka, 2013). Therefore sludge has to be incinerated for which the costs could rise up to 500 € per ton of wet sludge (Henze, et al. 2008). In order to reduce sludge volumes and therefore reduce sludge disposal costs, sludge has to be pre-treated. In the Netherlands, the most common sludge pre-treatment technique is thermal pressure hydrolysis (TH). TH is a costly process since large amounts of energy are consumed by heating the sludge (Schepers and Elzen, 2013). In addition, the TH system requires a lot of maintenance and is hardly scalable which in the future may cause problems regarding the growing world population, with the corresponding growing sludge production levels (Schepers and Elzen, 2013). In {{order to be able to}} handle the expected future sludge amounts new techniques have to be developed based on the improvement of sludge reduction, pathogen removal and increase of potential sludge benefits. In this study a newly developed sludge treatment technique is examined. The technique is developed by the company Whirlwind International and is based, on “active hydrodynamic cavitation” (Bakker, 2012). Literature describes ‘active hydrodynamic cavitation’ as a situation in which passive hydrodynamic cavitation is accompanied by external forces (Bakker, 2012). In this research ‘hydrodynamic cavitation’ was generated by using a constriction (venturi pipe) which caused a sudden pressure drop within a stream flow. A vibrating ball was placed within the constriction to create the ‘active hydrodynamic cavitation’ event. In this research it was chosen to use secondary sludge from WWTP Houtrust during the ‘active hydrodynamic cavitation’ treatments since literature shows that an active hydrodynamic cavitation especially has a positive effect on the conversion of secondary sludge during the digestion phase (Rens, et al. 2005) and has less effect on primary sludge (Nickel, 2002). The cavitation treated sludge was assessed on three parameters: 1. improvement of the methane production levels, 2. improvement of the dewatering efficiency and 3. improvement of the total suspended solids (TSS) reduction levels. Based on the results it can be concluded that an active hydrodynamic cavitation treatment can result in the improvement of the methane production levels up to ~ 20 %, improvement of the TSS reduction levels by 0 - 3 % and the improvement/decline of the dewatering efficiency by ± 3 %. Profitability results shows that profits related to extra methane production levels are of significant less importance than the profits that can be achieved by the improvement of TSS reduction levels and dewatering efficiencies. However due to the large data ranges in TSS reduction levels and dewatering efficiencies both profits and losses can be generated which on average can rise up to ± € 350, 000 per year which accounts for ± 17 % difference on the total yearly sludge treatment costs. Based on the current study it is not likely that profits can be generated since these calculations are mostly based on assumptions. Overall can be concluded that the effect of an active hydrodynamic cavitation treatment on the improvement of the profitability of <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> <b>sludge</b> is still doubtful since results show broad data ranges and several assumptions were made for the calculations. Further research is needed to obtain a dataset without these data ranges and should especially be focused on the improvement of dewatering efficiencies...|$|E

Two areas, a cultivated area with Salix viminalis (0. 1 ha) and a stand of hybrid aspen, Populus triploides (0. 1 ha), were irrigated from June to September. The purpose of the project was to determine the capacity of the vegetation filter to accumulate nitrogen and minimise the amount of leachate water formed. Then a valuable wetland next to the landfill could be protected from eutrophication. The movement of water in volume over time was determined both by instrumental mesurement (Flygel) and by the land area and the specific runoff. In April in the area down to the wetland the movement of water over time was 18 l/s and 15 l/s respectively. In June-August 1. 4 l/s and 1. 2 l/s respectively and for the year 5 l/s and 4 l/s respectively. The loading of nitrogen on the wetland was in June-August 30 kg per month and for the year 110 kg per month. The amount of leachate water irrigated during the period was 529 mm, the real evapotranspiration amounted to 406 mm (576 mm) and the precipitation was only 160 mm (240 mm). The growth of the salix plants during the period of irrigation was very high. The maximum growth speed was 30 cm per week and the highest plants reached 325 - 375 cm {{at the end of the}} period. The stem growth at breast height for the irrigated trees in mean was 4. 9 mm in diameter and 3 times higher than the non irrigated trees. The difference in growth between the two groups of was proved significant by statistical analysis. The main explanations for the difference in stem growth is the amount of water reachable for the plants and the high content of nutrients (mostly nitrogen) in the water. Big trees grew better than small ones, which could be anticipated, and the growth was favoured in parcels with organic material mixed with moraine. Nitrogen content in stem wood dry matter after the irrigation period in the treated trees was 0. 41 % of DM and in the untreated trees 0. 34 % of DM. The total amount of nitrogen uptake was 69. 1 kg/ha and 18. 6 kg/ha respectively. The increase of nitrogen content in the topsoil due to nitrification in both treated and untreated plots suggest that recycling of inorganic nitrogen was good. Although not measured, it could be assumed that a big part, up to 60 kg/halyear, of the nitrogen has probably left the soil as nitrogenous gas due to denitrification. Nitrogen not taken up by plants or denitrificated has been recycled back into the leachate water. On a long-term basis, the salix plantation needs to increase 7 times to reduce the leachate water from the landfill at Rävsta. The result of this project indicate good possibilities of establishment and potentials for growth of energy forests on Rävstatippen. By an optimised composition of the topsoil, efficient weed treatment and optimised irrigation the vegetation filter is weIl developed. That results in good possibilities for nitrogen trapping from the leachate water and to reduce the amount of the leachate water...|$|E
40|$|This report {{discusses}} potential future {{systems for}} waste-to-energy {{production in the}} Baltic Sea Region, and especially for the project REMOWE partner regions, the County of Västmanland in Sweden, Northern Savo in Finland, Lower Silesia in Poland, western part of Lithuania and Estonia. The waste-to-energy systems planned for in the partner regions are combustion of municipal solid waste (MSW) and solid recovered fuels from household and industry as well as anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and agriculture waste. The potential future waste-to-energy systems in the partner regions include increased utilization of available waste resources. Examples of resources possible to use are straw {{that could be used}} for ethanol production and biowaste from households and manure {{that could be used for}} biogas production. If the utilization in all partner regions would reach the same level as already exists in the County of Västmanland it would correspond to an increased energy supply of 3 TWh/year which corresponds to about 2. 5 % of the total energy use in the partner regions year 2008. An important aspect of future anaerobic processes for biogas production is the possibility to use the residue. West Lithuanian biogas production residue is planned to be dewatered up to 90 % of dry matter to make future utilization options possible. Pre-processing is necessary to be able to use the residue from digestion of solid waste as fertilizer. The pre-processing should include crushing, removal of metals, wood and plastics, and pulping. Without pre-processing it is possible to combust the residues with energy utilisation. Results from an investigation of the residues from biogas production tests using substrates from the project partner regions show a remaining energy potential of the digestate corresponding to 17 to 50 % of the biogas energy. A combination of digestate combustion and fertilizer use could be a possibility. Hydrothermal carbonization, HTC, is a process that could be of interest to use for treating digestate in order both to utilize the energy left after biogas production but also for sanitation of the digestate. In this process heat is released and coal is produced. This process could also be of interest for waste-to-energy conversion of waste which is usually not usable for other biological process like e. g. biogas production, for example sharp leaved rush, straw or leaves from gardening etc. Initial tests on pulp and paper waste show promising results. Among the possible processes for increasing the output of biogas from anaerobic digestion using ultrasound technology for thickening of surplus <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> <b>sludge</b> can be mentioned. It allows increasing the biogas production up to 30 % and reducing the amount of organic substances in the digested sewage sludge by up to 25 %. Another area of possible improvement is the mixing in the digester. The mixing is important for distribution of microorganisms and nutrition, inoculation of fresh feed, homogenizing of the material and for the removal of end products of the metabolism. Studies of the digester for biowaste in the County of Västmanland indicate that about 30 % of digester volume can have dead and stagnant zones. 2 Waste-to-energy utilisation could also be possible to realise by further development and introduction of new processes and concepts. An option for solving the problem of old sewage sludge could be to use it in a gasifier to convert it to energy rich gases. Microbiological conversion of waste can be further developed to produce several different products, such as heat, power, fuels and chemicals, the development of so-called biorefineries. Also the biorefinery‘s water management can be renewed in order to remove toxic substances, minimize environmental impacts and produce pure, clean water. Finnoflag Oy has developed a technology that converts waste materials into e. g. fuels, chemicals, plastic and rubber via low-energy routes. The Finnoflag technology is based on the PMEU (Portable Microbe Enrichment Unit) which is a new innovative instrument for use in the microbe detection process and that is designed to create an optimal growth environment for microbes. For fibrous and well-structured biowaste dry digestion could be a good option for biogas production. Several different configurations have been tested in Germany. The garage digestion method has the advantage that an extensive pre- treatment of substrate is not necessary and no pumps or stirrers, which can be destroyed by disturbing materials, are involved. However, the efficiency of garage digesters is low compared to other digestion methods due to lack of effective substrate turbation. More research work is needed to improve the efficiency. Tests of five existing dry digestion processes show that the Tower-digester is the most suitable dry digestion method for household waste. Among the reviewed plants the Dranco-tower digester showed the best efficiency in reference to biogas potential. The plant design is robust enough to handle substrates like household waste with fractions of disturbing materials. The mixing in the reactor is based on the force of gravity and the used pumps are powerful and very resistant. Pyrolysis is a process of interest for converting wood based waste into energy products such as gas, bio-oil and/or solid fuel/carbon. This has been identified as a process suitable for a new business model with a franchise based model, offering an earning opportunity for small size entrepreneurs. Possible improvement of existing and new waste-to-energy systems also includes increasing the overall efficiency of the utilization of waste resources by integration of several processes. A study on integrating pellets production from the residues from straw-based ethanol production with an existing combined heat and power plant shows that the total production cost can be reduced by the integration. Possible development of waste-to-energy systems for the partner regions could be the following:  Estonian - biogas production using the organic waste, use of the digestate as fertilizer on demand or combustion for power and heat production, recycling plants for paper, plastics and other recyclable wastes and combustion for power and heat production after recycling  North Savo, Finland- the same options as for Estonia is of interest. Added to this is the potential for power and heat production from large amount of wood waste. Also the possibility for pellet production from wood waste could be of interest.  Western Lithuania- the same system as mentioned for Finland is also of interest for western Lithuania. 3 　  Lower Silesia, Poland- also for Lower Silesia high amounts of organic wastes is suitable to use for biogas production in anaerobic digestion. Recovered derived fuel (RDF) is already used as fuel for power and heat production. There are also some attempts to involve combustion of residual mixed waste in 1 - 2 of the most densely populated areas.  County of Västmanland, Sweden- Here a system for separate collection of the biowaste from households, digestion of the fraction together with ley crop silage from regional farmers to produce biogas and use of the digestate from the digestion process as fertilizer at farmland already exists and a new power and heat plant using recovered derived fuels is under construction. Further waste- to-energy plants for production of bioethanol from straw and biogas from agricultural waste could be possible. The potential future waste-to-energy systems are not only dependent on available technologies for waste-to-energy conversion but also on the development within the waste and energy areas including also economic and political aspects. There is a growing interest for waste prevention in waste management within the EU, and growing concern about food losses and food waste at global and national levels. During past decades the waste amounts have steadily increased with economic growth but due to waste prevention actions a decoupling of the waste amount and economic growth is foreseen. This has to be considered in development of future waste-to-energy systems. Further, policies and goals concerning fossil fuel free transportation systems and low carbon energy systems is of importance. Analysis of combined previous proposed scenarios for energy demand and use development and waste amount development for waste-to-energy in Sweden 2010 to 2050 shows that the contribution of waste-to-energy to the total energy supply in 2050 varies from 6 to 47 % depending on the scenarios combined. The lowest contribution occur for scenarios with low waste amounts combined with energy scenarios with low changes in energy demand while the highest contribution occurs for scenarios with high amount of waste combined with energy scenarios with large decrease in energy demand.

The effect of activation conditions on H 2 S gas adsorption efficiency of drinking <b>water</b> <b>sludge</b> was experimented. In this study, raw drinking <b>water</b> <b>sludge</b> was divided into 3 groups. In the first group, drinking <b>water</b> <b>sludge</b> was only oven dried at 105 °C. For the other 2 groups, drinking <b>water</b> <b>sludge</b> was soaked in 2. 5 M NaOH solution. After soaking, the sludge was divided into 2 groups (group 2 and 3). The second group was washed with distilled water until pH 7; while the third group was not. Biogas from a swine farm was used with an initial H 2 S gas concentration in the range of 2, 000 - 4, 000 ppm. The material analysis showed that more surface area and total volume of sludge can be obtained after activated with NaOH. From the adsorption experiments, {{it was found that the}} highest adsorption capacity (qe) of 87. 94 mg H 2 S/g adsorptive material can be achieved by using sludge from the third group.

40|$|Heavy {{metals in}} <b>waste</b> <b>waters</b> and <b>sludge</b> may cause {{significant}} environmental problems, {{and it is}} known that conventional recovery technologies cannot always achieve satisfactory treatment. For example, they are inappropiate to completely recover the chromium in the case of <b>waste</b> <b>waters</b> from the tanning process. Chromium can be recovered (by precipitation) from effluents that contain high concentrations of this metal. However, effluents from the later stages in present day tanning process often have a low concentration of chromium that cannot be recovered and is found in the sludge of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The aim of our research is to recover and reuse the chromiun (III) from post-tanning effluents by means of a biotechnological sequestering method using acidophilic fungi. In this study, we tested acidophilic fungi capable to grow in the presence of chromiun in <b>waste</b> <b>waters</b> from various stages of a real post-tanning process. When the post-tanning process was carried out on a pilot plant scale in which conventional rechroming and neutralisation stages were undertaken and the use of additional chemicals was avoided, chromium (III) sequestration values of above 95 % were obtained. As these results are so promising, further studies will focus on searching for more resistant fungal strains and determining which of the chemicals used in the post-tanning process can be avoided or replaced by alternatives.
