500|$|The band {{spoke on}} their Facebook page {{and said they}} started {{recording}} new material on October 20. On January 16, 2012, they revealed track names for the new EP on Facebook. Initially, rumors spread {{about the possibility of}} Down releasing four EPs, instead of an album. However, when asked about it in an interview with Scuzz TV, Anselmo said that [...] "It would be too pretentious, <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> think as far ahead as that, and just go with what we feel at the time." [...] In the summer of 2013, Kirk Windstein quit the band and was replaced by Bobby Landgraf. Down IV– Part II was released on May 13, 2014.|$|E
500|$|Project 86's {{music is}} {{characterized}} by heavy rock and Schwab's [...] "loud, eerie, and atmospheric" [...] vocal style. Their sound has been likened to rock groups Helmet, Rage Against the Machine, and Tool. The moniker [...] "intense" [...] has frequently {{been used as a}} description. Rick Anderson of Allmusic called the music [...] "dense and crunchy", while Albuquerque Journal writer Ron Gonzales declared it a [...] "blisteringly heavy sound." [...] Commenting on their musical style, Schwab said, [...] "Our goal as a band has been to never make the same record twice. The only rule is that there are no rules. If there is a rule, it's that <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> over-think things, that the music that comes out is honest and real, spontaneous and from our heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Elliott Gould and Christina Pickles reprised {{their roles}} as Jack and Judy Geller. The set for the Geller house was used {{previously}} in [...] "The One Where Joey Moves Out", for Jack's birthday party and in the season seven episode [...] "The One Where Rosita Dies", when Ross and Monica visit their parent's garage. The flashback in Thanksgiving 1987 was Monica and Chandler's first meeting along with Rachel and Chandler. Bright commented that the show tries not to contradict itself; [...] "once we establish something, <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> undo it." [...] In [...] "The Pilot" [...] it appears Rachel meets Chandler for the first time. She also meets him in a later flashback episode, [...] "The One Where The Stripper Cries". To excuse the continuity error, Bright adds they do not remember each other meeting because they look different.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{will think}} of us when you be his wife, Tess, and of how we told 'ee that we loved him, and how <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hate you, and did not hate you, and could not hate you, because you were his choice, and we never hoped to be chose by him." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{think too}} hard about his behavior. It was not {{rational}} {{much of the}} time, but to even consider such a thing was a discreditable thought and you couldn't allow yourself to have a discreditable thought. One of the questions in a security check was, [...] "Have you ever had any unkind thoughts about LRH?" [...] and you could get into very serious trouble if you had. So you <b>tried</b> hard <b>not</b> <b>to.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Of course {{everything}} {{depends on}} the repertoire which is quite large – more than two thousand works. Depending on the concert we choose a special repertoire. We have a rule that <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> break. In any country we sing 2–3 songs in the native language {{of the people who}} live there. As a rule it helps to find a rapport with, and the appreciation of, the audience. And for us it is some kind of musical gift, to honour the host country and its people. For instance in Canada when we sang the National Anthem of Russia people stood up to show respect to our country, and when we finished we sang their country's anthem Oh, Canada!.|$|E

5000|$|Critical in the {{planning}} {{was the idea of}} plausible deniability, that it should be impossible to prove a direct connection between the assassinations and Israel. In addition, the operations were more generally intended to terrorize Palestinian militants. According to David Kimche, former deputy head of Mossad, [...] "The aim was not so much revenge but mainly to make them Palestinian terrorists frightened. We wanted to make them look over their shoulders and feel that we are upon them. And therefore <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> do things by just shooting a guy in the street - that's easy...fairly." ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{shilling}} apiece seemed handsome {{for those}} [...] "strongs mans," [...] but afterward there were watches of the nights when the spirit grieved that the shilling {{had not been}} made two apiece or even half a crown, and I wish now that the first reader of mine who toboggans down Madeira would {{make up the difference}} for me in his tip to those poor fellows. I do not mind if he adds a few pennies for the children who ran before our toboggan and tossed camellias into it, and then followed in the hopes of a reward, which <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> disappoint.|$|R

6000|$|... “One {{can imagine}} it,” she laughed. “Well, {{you have to}} face the gale and fog, while <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be beaten by Jefferson and to meet our bills. I don’t know which is the harder.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I said that," [...] he {{answered}} slowly; [...] "I was feelin' a bit low. You can't help it sometimes; it's the thing comin' on you, {{and no way}} out of it--that's what gets over you. <b>We</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> think about it, as a rule." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to Muriel Huisman, Project Architect for the Rijksmuseum's renovation, [...] "Cruz y Ortiz {{always like}} {{to look for a}} synergy between old and new, and <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> explain things with our architecture.” With the Rijks, “there’s no cut between old and new; we’ve tried to merge it. We did this by looking for {{materials}} that were true to the original building, resulting in a kind of silent architecture." ...|$|E
5000|$|Brassland {{published}} this mission statement on its website: [...] "Music is our current focus. We like music that transcends genre. At {{the same time}} <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make transcending genre a cliché by applying labels to what we do: funk-metal, progressive punk, Afro-Cuban jazz, underground hip-hop, intelligent dance music, whateva! We like musicians who play well and possess the elusive tonic of personality. Most of all we just like music." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ellis {{has also}} noted the {{influence}} of the band's collective Christian faith: [...] "I do think that because I’m a Christian and we’re all Christians, regardless of whether <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make our music Christian...it just bleeds through because it’s who we are. I feel like it’s going to happen regardless of what I try to set out to do because God’s in me. I think it is in there, but you just have to look for it." ...|$|E
30|$|Sixth, we {{attempted}} to use simple and natural language, repeated nouns instead of using pronouns to avoid vague referents, and used specific rather than general terms. On the contrary, we avoided elements that could be ambiguous, negative constructions, questions that ask two questions in one, as well as metaphors. Additionally, <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> word the question {{in a way that}} it suggested that the behaviour was rather common. We also abstained from including reasons that explained the behaviour, as we consider, for instance, that the question “Watch speakers’ gestures and general body language to help me figure out the meaning of what they are saying” (Cohen, Oxford, and Chi, 2002) is too explicit and, as a consequence, it may influence students’ responses due to the tendency pointed out by Bakan (1954) to supply socially acceptable data.|$|R

5000|$|Michael Messenger states: [...] "Twelveheads Press {{is not a}} {{conventional}} publishing house in the usual sense, but three friends who publish subjects that interest us. Our knowledge ensures that the books are authentic and accurate. Whilst <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> lose money on books {{because we do not}} rely on Twelveheads Press for our living we can afford to reject manuscripts that are not to the standards we want and expect. It is only the support of the reading public that has kept us in business for over 30 years." ...|$|E
5000|$|Where the band's {{recorded}} {{sound is}} layered with many melodies, their live sound {{is a more}} intense experience with a more visceral wall of noise, something the band wanted to do all along. Graham stated, [...] "We like having {{the contrast between the}} record and playing live. There are a lot more instruments on the record. There's only four of us in the band, so we have to keep it as simple as possible. I don't know about you, but I don't like going to see a band that sounds just like their album. That's what <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked about}} their sound in an {{interview}} with UK music blog There Goes the Fear in Leeds in October 2010, singer Jonathan Higgs replied, [...] "We think of it as rock primarily. <b>We</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> make it sound like a lot of things you’ve heard before, not on purpose, but it tends to come out a bit like that. We’re not really interested in copying certain genres or anything, so I guess you’d say it’s unpredictable and sort of surprising." [...] Higgs has counted Nirvana, Radiohead, the Beatles, Destiny's Child, and R. Kelly as some of the band's very eclectic stock of influences.|$|E
5000|$|At first, <b>we</b> were <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> mess around, {{but then}} the Georgians exerted so much cruelty against Armenians {{that we had to}} back the Abkhazians. They would invade the houses and rob and torture the people. In Labra, they seated a married couple on chairs with holes on the seats and burned them. They were raping the women. It was {{impossible}} to stay neutral.|$|R
5000|$|Its real {{message is}} not that we should like or respect Jews; only that <b>we</b> should <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hate them.

Bill! It's all right! They’re not that bad!’ ...|$|R
5000|$|Several {{members of}} the band have, {{for as long as}} a decade, worked for {{organizations}} that meet the basic living requirements of the chronically poor, drug addicted and mentally ill in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside neighborhood, such as Insite.

50|$|At {{the time}} when Geoff hit Staples no one was skating low-cut, thin vulc shoes. No one had felt their board in nearly half a decade. Shoes {{at the time were}} so disgusting and bulky <b>we</b> <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> think about them. But when Geoff shot that ad, doing the gnarliest trick on the biggest hubba, showing people it wasn't about {{creating}} a bulletproof space shoe for the year 3000 that would last for six months but rather the priority is and always should be about board-feel everyone took a long, hard look at their feet and wondered, 'What the f@#k are we wearing?' History was rewritten that day, by this man.|$|E
