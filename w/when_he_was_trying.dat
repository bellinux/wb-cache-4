5|$|This led Pausch {{to conduct}} a virtual reality class at Carnegie Mellon, to teach others {{and to help them}} realize their {{childhood}} dreams. In the course, 50 students from the university were separated into random teams of four and were each assigned a project relating to building a virtual world. Each group had two weeks to work on the project, and then presented the project to the group. The teams were then randomized again and a new project began. The project then evolved into something that people came to watch, and helped his students realize their potential. Finally, Pausch gave a few words of advice on how others could achieve their childhood dreams, and who his role models were <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to do so.|$|E
5|$|Following Connor {{receiving}} Delia's corneas, Chloe {{began to}} become more attached to him. Unbeknownst to Chelsea and Kevin, Chloe's attachment becomes unhealthy, especially when Kevin finds that Chloe included photographs of Connor in Delia's baby scrapbook. While Billy goes to grief counseling, Chloe refuses and says she is handling her grief from Delia's death by herself. When it is revealed that Chelsea's husband Adam in fact struck Delia with his car that night and is later presumed dead, Chloe becomes increasingly angry with Chelsea and {{goes so far as}} blaming her for Delia's death. Afterward, Chloe breaks down at a fundraiser event for a foundation in Delia's name and goes into Chelsea's home (who had initially planned on moving to Paris with Adam and Connor), takes Connor and Chelsea's passport and poses as her at the airport, where she intends on flying to Paris with Connor and starting a new life. Chelsea and Kevin meet Chloe and Connor in Paris, where she comes to terms with what she's done. Back in Genoa City, Chloe is arrested for kidnapping and is given the choice of psychiatric inpatient or outpatient treatment. Wanting outpatient treatment, she has to be placed under a conservatorship, and not wanting it to be under Esther, Kevin proposes to her and they abruptly marry again. Not considering their reunion to be genuine, Chloe refuses to consummate her marriage with Kevin, hurting him. Despite Chelsea and Chloe making up, she is offended when Chelsea registers a restraining order against her, keeping her away from Connor. They later appear to make up, but Chloe still harbors anger for her and tears up one of the dresses Chelsea designed for a Jabot fashion shoot. Despite receiving treatment, Chloe decides that she wants another child to replace Delia, however not fathered by Kevin but by Billy. She asks Billy for his sperm so she can be inseminated and become pregnant, but he immediately refuses and alerts Chelsea, Kevin and her other loved ones. While they plan an intervention, Chloe goes to the sperm bank at the hospital and is able to steal a specimen of sperm that Billy donated <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to get pregnant with his wife, Victoria. She is blindsided by what her loved ones propose, which is getting treatment from a psychiatric facility. Kevin also accepted that he can't give Chloe the help she needs and Chloe accepts that she needs help. She chooses a facility in California, the night before leaving, she and Kevin make love one last time. She leaves town soon after, having had heartfelt goodbyes with her friends and family. However, she reveals that she still has Billy's sperm in her bag before leaving town. Soon after, Kevin sends her flowers, but she refuses them, and asks that Kevin not visit her, devastating him.|$|E

25|$|The Dirac {{matrices}} {{were first}} written down by Paul Dirac <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> {{to write a}} relativistic first-order wave equation for the electron, and give an explicit isomorphism from the Clifford algebra to the algebra of complex matrices.

25|$|Soon Berger passed Moreno for {{fifth and}} this became fourth when Prost spun, {{dropping}} two places. Moreno then retired with gearbox troubles. At the front, {{the gap between}} Mansell and Senna was around 4–5 seconds with Alesi third, a long way back. However, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to lap Suzuki, he hit Suzuki, taking both out. After the stops, Mansell stayed 10 seconds ahead of Senna with Berger a long way back but 20 seconds ahead of Prost.|$|E

25|$|His rotator-cuff injury {{diagnosed}} in March 1997 kept {{him away from}} cricket till November 1997. Until that time, {{he was a real}} express bowler. This injury was very serious (caused due to overload of bowling) and Srinath at that time had 92 Test wickets from 27 Tests- only 46 in his first 18 Tests, but 46 in his last 9 games. It was wondered if Srinath would ever be able to bowl again, let alone be ranked among the fastest bowlers in the world. After he announced his retirement in Nov 2003, Srinath revealed that he feared his career was over <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to recover from the rotator-cuff injury.

25|$|As {{common to}} monasteries of the time, the complex is fronted {{by a very}} large atrium. This atrium is {{surrounded}} by a stone wall topped with merlons. The main entrance to the atrium from the street has merlons, as well as the chapels found on each of the wall’s four corners. From the main entrance to the church, there is a volcanic stone walkway, divided by an atrium cross, which has a heart, a chalice and a depiction of the Host in low relief. The atrium cross is not the original. The original was broken by a child in 1961 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to climb onto its base. The cross fell onto the child killing him. Along the atrium walls on the inside, {{there are a number of}} empty niches that remain, which probably held images related to the Stations of the Cross. Access to the chapels in the corners, called capillas posas, is in the atrium. These chapels’ primary function was the house the Host during processions on Corpus Christi.|$|E
25|$|The Browns {{won their}} second {{game of the}} season, a shutout victory over the Baltimore Colts in Cleveland. An {{interception}} by Warren Lahr set up Cleveland's first score, a short touchdown run by Edgar Jones. A 70-yard drive on five plays {{at the beginning of}} the third quarter was capped by a touchdown throw from Graham to end Dante Lavelli to give the Browns a 14–0 lead. The team's third and final touchdown came later in the third quarter on an 81-yard drive. The shutout was the Browns' first since 1947 and extended a long unbeaten streak, but Cleveland suffered a rash of injuries. Groza remained out with a leg injury, while defensive end George Young sustained a serious cheekbone injury <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to tackle Baltimore quarterback Y. A. Tittle at the end of the second quarter. His cheekbone was broken and caved in, and he was taken to a Cleveland hospital for plastic surgery. Marion Motley suffered a rib injury, Edgar Jones hurt his thigh, and Bill Boedeker had a knee injury, although all three were expected to play in the following week's game against the New York Yankees. Despite that the Colts game was the Browns' home opener, only 21,621 were in attendance, the smallest home crowd in the club's four-year history.|$|E

25|$|Senna won {{the start}} and built up a small lead over Prost. Senna {{suffered}} an electrical problem when leading the race and his engine started to misfire. He signalled Prost through to a lead he would not lose on lap 34. Williams ended up being the only team to finish with both cars as the dirty track and unforgiving concrete walls ended six races, with the heat and dust cutting out many more. One driver, Alessandro Nannini, suffered from a severely sore neck after a crash in the morning warm-up and retired from fourth place on lap 10. Mansell and Berger suffered with the Ferrari V12s cutting out from identical alternator failures and both eventually retired. Patrese's second gave him third place in the championship, while Prost took the lead. Ecstatic Phoenix native Eddie Cheever celebrated his and his team's first podium of the season at his own home grand prix. The Brabhams, on the other hand, continued their lacklustre return, both drivers retiring with worn-out brakes. Dallara's Alex Caffi {{was the victim of}} a bizarre crash. Holding down 5th place, he was put into the wall on lap 52 by his own team mate Andrea de Cesaris <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to lap him. The notorious de Cesaris later claimed he did not even know Caffi was there trying to lap him.|$|E
500|$|During 1999, the McCain-Feingold Act {{once again}} {{came up for}} consideration, this time with soft money {{prohibition}} features in but the issue ads provision out. [...] McConnell challenged McCain to name specific senators who had been corrupted by existing campaign finance practices, but McCain refused. [...] In the end, the same failure to gain cloture befell the legislation again. [...] During that year, McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Feingold for their work in trying to enact this campaign finance reform; McCain was cited for opposing his own party on the bill at a time <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to win the party's presidential nomination. [...] Indeed, by April 1999 aspects of McCain's 2000 presidential campaign were underway, and his stance regarding the Kosovo War and other issues would take place in that context.|$|E
500|$|He left CAI {{at the age}} of 18 {{and began}} a degree in French at the University of Ulster, (formally Ulster Polytechnic) in Jordanstown. He stayed at {{university}} for a year before dropping out. In a 1999 interview, Nesbitt said, [...] "I had the necessary in my head, but I just couldn't be bothered. Being 18 is the worst age to expect people to learn things. There are other things to be bothered with, like girls and football." [...] He made the decision to quit <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to write an overdue essay on existentialism in Les Mains Sales at 4am one day. His father suggested that he should move to England if he wanted to continue acting, so Nesbitt enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama (CSSD), part of University of London. Nesbitt felt lost and misrepresented when he first arrived in London, on account of his Northern Irish background; [...] "When I first came to drama school I was a Paddy the minute I walked in. And I remember going to drama school and them all saying to me, 'Aww, yeah, Brits out', and I was like 'It's a wee bit more complicated than that, you know.'"

Dobby later told Harry of the Room in detail and admitted to frequently bringing Winky to the room to cure her bouts of Butterbeer-induced drunkenness, finding it full of antidotes and a [...] "nice elf-sized bed." [...] Filch was said to find cleaning supplies here when he had run out; when Fred and George needed a place to hide, it would appear as a broom cupboard. Trelawney also makes a habit of using it to hide her empty sherry bottles after she is sacked in Order of the Phoenix. It would seem that when one wishes to hide something it produces the same room for everyone: the Room of Hidden Things, which is full of many centuries worth of abandoned objects, such as broken furniture, books, and in one case a dead quintaped (for more information see Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them), which were presumably forgotten by their owners.|$|E
2500|$|That same month, Harrison Ford {{fractured}} his leg while filming at Pinewood after {{a hydraulic}} {{door on the}} Millennium Falcon set fell on him and {{was taken to a}} hospital. According to Abrams, Ford's ankle [...] "went to a 90-degree angle". Production was suspended for two weeks to accommodate Ford's injury. Ford's son Ben stated that the ankle would likely need a plate and screws and that filming could be altered slightly, with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered. A month later, Jake Steinfeld, Ford's personal trainer, said that Ford was recovering rapidly. Abrams also suffered a fractured vertebra in his back <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> to help lift the door after Ford's accident.
