50|$|A faucet aerator (or tap aerator) {{is often}} {{found at the}} tip of modern indoor <b>water</b> <b>faucets.</b> Aerators can be simply screwed onto the faucet head, {{creating}} a no-splashing stream and often delivering a mixture of water and air.|$|R

50|$|If, for example, someone flushes {{a toilet}} while the shower is in use, the fixture {{suddenly}} draws {{a significant amount}} of cold water from the common supply line, causing a pressure drop. In the absence of a compensating mechanism, the relatively higher pressure in the hot water supply line will cause the shower temperature to rise just as suddenly, possibly reaching an uncomfortable or even dangerous level. Conversely, if someone opens a hot <b>water</b> <b>faucet</b> elsewhere, the relatively higher pressure in the cold water supply line will cause the shower temperature to drop suddenly.|$|E

To ensure the financing, the decree suspended for three years all payments from the revenue generated by the Fernando II acqueduct, imposed an annual fee of 45 pesos for each <b>water</b> <b>faucet</b> and authorized the governorship to raise another 500,000 pesos through taxes, if necessary.|$|E

50|$|Day-use hours vary {{depending}} upon {{the time of year}} but generally range from 8 a.m. to sunset. Twenty-three campsites are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Ramadas, fire rings, restrooms and <b>water</b> <b>faucets</b> are provided for campers. Water and electrical hook-ups are not available. Picnic tables are located throughout the valley floor. Fires are restricted to the fire rings provided in the campground.|$|R
50|$|On {{romantic and}} family picnics, a picnic basket and a blanket (to sit or recline on) are usually brought along. Outdoor games {{or some other}} form of {{entertainment}} are common at large picnics. In established public parks, a picnic area generally includes picnic tables and possibly other items related to eating outdoors, such as built-in grills, <b>water</b> <b>faucets,</b> garbage containers, and restrooms.|$|R
50|$|Condiments {{and tools}} are usually found near the seats, for example pickled ginger, chopsticks, soy sauce, and small dishes for the soy sauce. Wasabi may be {{either at the}} seat or on the {{conveyor}} belt. Self-served tea and ice water is usually complimentary, with cups stacked on a shelf above the conveyor belt and teabags or green tea powder in a storage container on the table. There is also a hot <b>water</b> <b>faucet</b> at the tables to make tea. On the shelves are usually wet paper towels and plastic boxes to store sushi for take-out customers.|$|E
50|$|Home lawn {{sprinklers}} {{vary widely}} in their size, cost, and complexity. They include impact sprinklers, oscillating sprinklers, drip sprinklers, and underground sprinkler systems. Small sprinklers {{are available at}} home and garden stores or hardware stores for small costs. These are often attached to an outdoor <b>water</b> <b>faucet</b> and are placed only temporarily. Other systems may be professionally installed permanently {{in the ground and}} are attached permanently to a home's plumbing system. An ingenious domestic sprinkler made by Nomad called a 'set-and-forget tractor sprinkler' was used in Australia in the 1950s. Water pressure ensured that the sprinkler slowly moved across a lawn.|$|E

50|$|Brennan {{was born}} in 1994 in Albany, New York, with osteogenesis imperfecta, {{commonly}} known as brittle bone disease, which stunted his growth and requires him to use a wheelchair. He estimates he had broken bones 120 times in his first 19 years, which caused great pain. His short arms prevent him from picking items off the floor or out of cupboards; Brennan uses mechanical reacher arms to reach into cabinets or to turn on <b>water</b> <b>faucets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Breer made {{additional}} parts {{needed for}} the steam engine. One piece was a Bunsen-type burner fueled by gasoline to heat the boiler for the steam. This required about 3,000 small holes to be drilled into the inner chamber of the air tubes. Since there was no drill that could do this, Breer improvised a high-speed Pelton type drill press that operated on water pressure from their outdoor <b>water</b> <b>faucet.</b> With his innovation, the holes were drilled in a short time. Breer assembled his car in 1901, with some help in upholstery, trimming and painting the car supplied by hired carriage workers. The maiden voyage of Breer’s steam car {{was made in the}} fall of 1901.|$|E
5000|$|Operation {{with low}} supply {{pressure}}: Tankless systems are reliant {{on the water}} pressure that is delivered to the property. In other words, if a tankless system is used to deliver water to a shower or <b>water</b> <b>faucet,</b> the pressure {{is the same as}} the pressure delivered to the property and cannot be increased, whereas in tanked systems the tanks can be positioned above the water outlets (in the loft/attic space for example) so the force of gravity can assist in delivering the water, and pumps can be added into the system to increase pressure. Power showers, for example, cannot be used with tankless systems because the tankless systems cannot deliver the hot water at a fast enough flow rate required by the pump.|$|E
50|$|Alexander is {{essentially}} composed of one wide building sectioned off by wings. The Fine Arts wing {{consists of the}} theater, a band room, and a chorus room. The 100 wing hosts English and foreign language classrooms. The 200 wing hosts math and history classrooms. The 300 wing consists of science classrooms. Each classroom on the 300 wing has laboratory stations (<b>water</b> <b>faucet</b> and gas spout). The 400 wing (formerly known as the Freshman Academy) was added in the 2000s due to the rising number of incoming freshmen. The 400 wing is now a mixture of academic classrooms. The business wing hosts six large computer labs with classes ranging from Broadcast and Video Production to Web Page Design. The back wing hosts an art room equipped with a darkroom, {{as well as a}} nursing room, and a kitchen which enables the school to offer food classes.|$|E

50|$|Ball {{built the}} Florida National Bank {{building}} at 214 North Hogan Street in Jacksonville in 1961. The structure was constructed using materials which would appreciate in value, such as marble floors and granite exteriors, but excluded items that Ball considered frills. There were no executive washrooms and no hot <b>water</b> <b>faucets</b> {{in the entire}} eleven story edifice. The corporate offices of the group were housed in the upper floors and the bank's principal location {{was on the ground}} floor. Ed Ball also kept his personal office there for managing the du Pont Trust. After Ball's death, the structure was renamed the Edward Ball Building.|$|R
