Acheroraptor was recovered {{as a member of}} the clade containing Eudromaeosauria and Microraptorinae, confirming its referral to the Dromaeosauridae, and possibly to Eudromaeosauria. Within that clade, however, most taxa were recovered in a large polytomy, due to the limited codings available for Acheroraptor.|$|E
50|$|Carstensen, Gottman, and Levenson (1995) {{found that}} “Negative {{emotional}} behavior, such as expressed anger, sadness, contempt, and other negative emotions, {{appears to be}} the best discriminator between satisfied and dissatisfied marriages”. Carstensen, Gottman, and Levenson (1995) also discovered that “In terms of speaker behaviors, wives <b>were</b> <b>coded</b> <b>as</b> showing more total emotion, negative emotion, anger, joy, contempt, whining, and sadness.” This supports the stereotype that women express more emotion than men both in general and in relationships. It also supports the idea that men are less expressive than women and tend to be more defensive minded in conversations.|$|E
50|$|While the {{majority}} of the wagons were built as HAAs, the final batch (built in 1982 as 368000-368459) <b>were</b> <b>coded</b> <b>as</b> HDA to indicate their ability to operate at up to 60 mph when empty instead of the standard 45 mph. This was achieved through modifications to the design of the brakes. Another variation, which did not initially result in a change of TOPS code, was the fitting of top canopies to increase the load volume. Many of the early wagons had these but then lost them and for some years canopied hoppers were only common in Scotland.|$|E

This type of engines <b>were</b> <b>coded</b> <b>as</b> 3K (1.2 L) and 4K (1.3 L) Toyota engines and {{came with a}} four- or five-speed manual transmission, {{as well as a}} two- or three-speed automatic option. The 88 PS (SAE) 1588 cc overhead valve 12T engine was also available from 1978 on; this could also be ordered with a three-speed automatic with overdrive. There was also a 1.4-litre engine available, offering 86 PS (SAE).|$|E

5000|$|Croats {{were first}} {{noticeable}} in Australia during the gold rushes of the 1850s {{in the province}} of Victoria. At this time, Croats <b>were</b> <b>coded</b> <b>as</b> [...] "Austrians" [...] because most of Croatia {{was a part of the}} Habsburg Empire. By Australian federation in 1901, there were many Croats—mainly from Dalmatia—in Australia, counted with Czechs, Hungarians, Serbs, Slovaks and others as [...] "Austro-Hungarians". The establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes from Austria-Hungary after the First World War—renamed to Yugoslavia shortly afterwards—continued to make it difficult to separate out Croats from other ethnicities in Australia. Croats were not recorded separately until the 1996 Census. The Australian Department of Immigration believes many Croats holding old (and now long out of date) Yugoslav passports still record themselves as Yugoslavs in Australian censuses, over a decade after the disintegration of Yugoslavia.|$|E

50|$|While very useful, or even {{essential}} to overcome DOS's limitations, TSR programs {{had a reputation}} as troublemakers. Many of the programs effectively hijacked the operating system in varying documented or undocumented ways, often causing systems to crash on their activation or deactivation when used with particular application programs or other TSRs. As explained above, some viruses <b>were</b> <b>coded</b> <b>as</b> TSRs, and were deliberately troublesome. Additionally, all program code in DOS systems, even those with large amounts of physical RAM, had to be loaded into the first 640 KB of RAM (the conventional memory). TSRs were no exception, and took chunks from that 640 KB that were thus unavailable to application programs. This meant that writing a TSR was a challenge of achieving the smallest possible size for it, and checking it for compatibility with a lot of software products from different vendors—often a very frustrating task.|$|E
5000|$|Objections to {{sensibility}} {{emerged on}} other fronts. For one, some conservative thinkers believed in a priori concepts, that is, knowledge that exists independent of experience, such as innate knowledge {{believed to be}} imparted by God. Theorists of the a priori distrusted sensibility because of its over-reliance on experience for knowledge. Also, in the last decades of the eighteenth century, anti-sensibility thinkers often associated the emotional volatility of sensibility with the exuberant violence of the French Revolution, {{and in response to}} fears of revolution coming to Britain, sensible figures <b>were</b> <b>coded</b> <b>as</b> anti-patriotic or even politically subversive. Maria Edgeworth's Leonora, for example, depicts the [...] "sensible" [...] Olivia as a villainess who contrives her passions or at least bends them to suit her selfish wants; the text also makes a point to say that Olivia has lived in France and thus adopted [...] "French" [...] manners. Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility provides a more familiar example of this reaction against the excesses of feeling, especially those associated with women readers, and many critics have seen the novel as a critique of the [...] "cult" [...] of sentimentalism prevalent in the late eighteenth century.|$|E
30|$|Participants’ verbal {{descriptions}} were segmented into propositions (i.e., {{the unit}} of meaning in a sentence).

For example, “…on each side there are two valves…” was coded as one structure information unit. Propositions containing action verbs, either by or on a part, <b>were</b> <b>coded</b> <b>as</b> action. Additionally, propositions with “has-a” or “is-a” <b>were</b> <b>coded</b> <b>as</b> action if the argument was about action, for example, “…that’s one half cycle rotation…” was coded as action but “…there is the compression phase…” was coded as structure. Although compression is an action, phase is of structure.|$|E
