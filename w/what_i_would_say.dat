While Dinklage has come to accept his condition, he {{sometimes}} found it challenging when growing up. In 2003, he {{said that when he}} was younger he was often angry and bitter about his condition, but as he got older, he realized that he [...] "just ha {{to have a sense of}} humor", to know [...] "that it's not your problem. It's theirs." [...] When asked in 2012 whether he saw himself as [...] "a spokesman for the rights of little people", Dinklage responded: [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> Everyone's different. Every person my size has a different life, a different history. Different ways of dealing with it. Just because I'm seemingly okay with it, I can't preach how to be okay with it." [...] Dinklage has been viewed as a role model for people sharing his condition.|$|E
500|$|In April 2011 {{before the}} release of Thor (2011), Marvel Studios {{president}} Kevin Feige stated that following The Avengers (2012), [...] "Thor will go off into a new adventure." [...] Kenneth Branagh, director of Thor, responded to his comments, saying, [...] "It is kind of news to me. Here's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to that: It's that I'm thrilled they're that confident. I shall wait for the audience to tell us whether {{there should be a}} second one, and then if that's a nice conversation to be had [...] all of us, that'd be thrilling. But I've got too much Irish superstitious blood in me to assume that Thor 2 will happen. But if Marvel says so, then I guess it must be true". Feige later explained that Marvel Studios would gauge how well Thor did at the box office before announcing sequels, but stated, [...] "Don Payne is working on story ideas for a part two. We've got various options with Ken [...] to discuss coming back, but right now {{the focus is on the}} first one. Don is, slowly but surely, thinking about where to take the character next should we be so lucky".|$|E
2500|$|Rowling has said, [...] "I've taken horrible liberties with {{folklore}} and mythology, but I'm quite unashamed about that, because British {{folklore and}} British mythology {{is a totally}} bastard mythology. You know, we've been invaded by people, we've appropriated their gods, we've taken their mythical creatures, and we've soldered them all together to make, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> {{is one of the}} richest folklores in the world, because it's so varied. So I feel no compunction about borrowing from that freely, but adding a few things of my own." ...|$|E
60|$|That, then, is the {{substance}} of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> fain <b>say</b> convincingly, if it might be, to my girl friends; at all events with certainty {{in my own mind}} that I was thus far a safe guide to them.|$|R
60|$|Wise. <b>What!</b> Why <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> hope no Good man, no man of good conscience, no {{man that}} either feareth God, regardeth the credit of Religion, {{the peace of}} Gods people, or the {{salvation}} of his own soul, will do thus.|$|R

And that is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> to everybody.’ Ineffable loftiness on Mr. Sapsea’s part accompanies these words, as leaving the sentence to be understood: ‘You will not easily believe that your society can be a satisfaction to a man like myself; nevertheless, it is.’ ...|$|R

60|$|It was {{necessary}} my father prompt me before I found my tongue {{to repeat the}} message, and I fancied the marquis himself must have understood somewhat of that which was in my mind, for he took me by the hand kindly, asking <b>what</b> it was <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to him, and but for {{the difference in the}} faces I might have said it was little Frenchie with whom I was speaking.|$|R

60|$|Every word this {{creature}} {{said was a}} cordial to me, and put new life and new spirit into my heart; my blood began to circulate immediately, and I was quite another body; I ate my victuals again, and grew better presently after it. She said {{a great deal more}} to the same purpose, and then, having pressed me to be free with her, and promised in the solemnest manner to be secret, she stopped a little, as if waiting to see what impression it made on me, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Miss Mohun {{wanted the}} whole troop {{to come up}} to Beechcroft to drink tea, and her {{relations}} consented; but the hearts of the Prescotts were a great deal too full for them not to wish to be alone together; and after Magdalen had given her hand to Lord Rotherwood with a fervent, [...] "You know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> my lord--beyond all words," [...] they turned homewards; but Mr. Flight ran after them to say in a low voice, [...] "Can we meet to-morrow at eight for a service of thanksgiving?"

60|$|And now {{to return}} to Shakespear. Though Mr Harris {{followed}} Tyler in identifying Mary Fitton as the Dark Lady, and the Earl of Pembroke as the addressee of the other sonnets {{and the man who}} made love successfully to Shakespear's mistress, he very characteristically refuses to follow Tyler on one point, though {{for the life of me}} I cannot remember whether it was one of the surmises which Tyler published, or only one which he submitted to me to see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> about it, just as he used to submit difficult lines from the sonnets.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt) It is {{somewhat}} surprising for Timothy Lull {{to be invited}} to address a liturgical conference of any sort.
