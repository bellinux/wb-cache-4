5|$|A CRA poll {{conducted}} throughout May 2013 continued to show declining support for Dunderdale, her government, and the PC Party. Only 21 per cent {{of those surveyed}} felt Dunderdale was {{the best choice for}} premier, behind both Michael and Ball. Dissatisfaction with her government increased to 65 per cent, compared to 33 per cent <b>who</b> <b>indicated</b> they were dissatisfied a year earlier. Support for the Progressive Conservatives also fell to just 27 per cent. This was below both the NDP and Liberals who were statistically tied for first, at 37 per cent and 36 per cent respectively. The poll also showed that 35 per cent of respondents were undecided or did not plan to vote, a significant increase from 14 per cent in November 2011. Towards the end of 2013, satisfaction for the Dunderdale administration saw a significant increase, though support for her and the PC Party saw little change from the poll in May. According to a November CRA poll, satisfaction with the Dunderdale government was up 10 points from May to 42 per cent, while dissatisfaction was at 52 per cent. A quarter of decided voters thought Dundedale was the best choice for premier, this was above Michael but 14 points below Ball. Due to a large drop in NDP support, down to 19 percent, the PC Party moved back into second place with 29 per cent of decided voters indicating that they would vote for the party in an election. The Liberal Party opened up a wide lead with 52 per cent of decided voters saying they would vote for the party in an election.|$|E
5|$|Back in Mopán, Amésqueta had {{received}} additional supplies {{and decided to}} catch up with his advance party. He left Mopán on 10 March 1696 with friar Agustín Cano and about 10 soldiers. He arrived at Chakal a week later but there was still no word from Díaz or AjK'ixaw. On 20 March Amésqueta left Chakal with 36 men and four days' supplies to find Díaz's party, whom he assumed would be nearby. After two days travelling in intense heat they met up with some Verapaz porters that Díaz had left behind. They followed Díaz's trail to the shore of Lake Petén Itzá near to the Itza capital. As they scouted along the south shore they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes, and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. There were plentiful signs that Díaz's party had passed that way, and Amésqueta assumed that they had crossed to Nojpetén. He wrote a letter to Díaz, which was passed to an Itza onlooker <b>who</b> <b>indicated</b> he would deliver it. Various Itzas now approached the party, including a nobleman who exchanged gifts with Amésqueta. During various attempts at communication to verify Díaz's whereabouts the Itza became agitated and responded angrily, although no-one in the Spanish party could understand the Itza language. The Itzas indicated that the Spanish should proceed to the lakeshore along a narrow path and embark in the small canoes that were stationed nearby. One of Amésqueta's officers recognised an Indian among the Itzas as a Mopan who had served as a soldier in Díaz's first expedition and thought that the Mopan was trying to tell him not to trust the Itzas.|$|E

25|$|The natural arsenic {{pollution}} {{occurs because}} aquifer sediments contain organic matter that generates anaerobic {{conditions in the}} aquifer. These conditions result in the microbial dissolution of iron oxides in the sediment and, thus, {{the release of the}} arsenic, normally strongly bound to iron oxides, into the water. As a consequence, arsenic-rich groundwater is often iron-rich, although secondary processes often obscure the association of dissolved arsenic and dissolved iron.. Arsenic is found in groundwater most commonly as the reduced species arsenite and the oxidized species arsenate, being the acute toxicity of arsenite somewhat greater than that of arsenate. Investigations by <b>WHO</b> <b>indicated</b> that 20% of 25,000 boreholes tested in Bangladesh had arsenic concentrations exceeding 50 μg/l.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, the World Health Organization (<b>WHO)</b> <b>indicated</b> {{that the}} {{residents}} of the area who were evacuated were exposed to low amounts of radiation and that radiation-induced health impacts are likely to be low. In particular, the 2013 WHO report predicts that for evacuated infant girls, their 0.75% pre-accident lifetime risk of developing thyroid cancer is calculated to be increased to 1.25% by being exposed to radioiodine, with the increase being slightly less for males. The risks from a number of additional radiation-induced cancers are also expected to be elevated due to exposure caused by the other low boiling point fission products that were released by the safety failures. The single greatest increase is for thyroid cancer, but in total, an overall 1% higher lifetime risk of developing cancers of all types, is predicted for infant females, with the risk slightly lower for males, making both some of the most radiation-sensitive groups. Along with those within the womb, which the WHO predicted, depending on their gender, to have the same elevations in risk as the infant groups.|$|E

25|$|By {{the latter}} 1970s, the Poona ashram {{was too small}} to contain the rapid growth and Rajneesh asked that somewhere larger be found. Sannyasins from around India started looking for properties: those found {{included}} one in the province of Kutch in Gujarat and two more in India's mountainous north. The plans were never implemented as mounting tensions between the ashram and the Janata Party government of Morarji Desai resulted in an impasse. Land-use approval was denied and, more importantly, the government stopped issuing visas to foreign visitors <b>who</b> <b>indicated</b> the ashram as their main destination. In addition, Desai's government cancelled the tax-exempt status of the ashram with retrospective effect, resulting in a claim estimated at $5 million. Conflicts with various Indian religious leaders aggravated the situation—by 1980 the ashram had become so controversial that Indira Gandhi, despite a previous association between Rajneesh and the Indian Congress Party dating back to the sixties, was unwilling to intercede for it after her return to power. In May 1980, during one of Rajneesh's discourses, an attempt on his life was made by Vilas Tupe, a young Hindu fundamentalist. Tupe claims that he undertook the attack, because he believed Rajneesh to be an agent of the CIA.|$|E
25|$|Nkrumah's retitling {{as prime}} {{minister}} had not given him additional power, and he sought constitutional reform {{that would lead to}} independence. In 1952, he consulted with the visiting Colonial Secretary, Oliver Lyttelton, <b>who</b> <b>indicated</b> that Britain would look favourably on further advancement, so long as the chiefs and other stakeholders had the opportunity to express their views. Initially skeptical of Nkrumah's socialist policies, Britain's MI5 had compiled large amounts of intelligence on Nkrumah through several sources, including tapping phones and mail interception under the codename of SWIFT. Beginning in October 1952, Nkrumah sought opinions from councils and from political parties on reform, and consulted widely across the country, including with opposition groups. The result the following year was a White Paper on a new constitution, seen as a final step before independence. Published in June 1953, the constitutional proposals were accepted both by the assembly and by the British, and came into force in April of the following year. The new document provided for an assembly of 104 members, all directly elected, with an all-African cabinet responsible for the internal governing of the colony. In the election on 15 June 1954, the CPP won 71, with the regional Northern People's Party forming the official opposition.|$|E
25|$|According {{to initial}} claims {{made by the}} railway, the {{engineer}} that left the train unattended went to the explosion zone and uncoupled the last 9 undamaged tank cars that {{were still on the}} tracks {{at the end of the}} derailment. After uncoupling the tank cars, he used a rail car mover to pull them away from the derailment site. This version of events has been disputed by Lac-Mégantic's fire chief, <b>who</b> <b>indicated</b> that a volunteer firefighter had used a rail car mover borrowed from a local factory to remove these cars from danger. It was later revealed that two employees of Tafisa (Serge Morin, Sylvain Grégoire), a firefighter (Benoît Héon), the MMA engineer (Tom Harding) and a member of the family-owned excavation company Lafontaine and Son (Pascal Lafontaine) had worked to move 9 tank cars away from the fire. Tafisa, a local particleboard industry that moves much of its product by rail, has a rail car mover which has the capability to deactivate the brakes on the cars it tows. Morin, aided by his colleague Grégoire, used the rail car mover to move the first 5 tank cars away from the fire. When they could not find a level crossing to move the rail car mover back to the disaster site, they used a loader to remove another 4 tank cars, 2 at a time. Because the loader lacked equipment to deactivate railcar brakes, Harding told the men to use the loader to break the air lines on cars to release the air brakes on each of these four cars. Lafontaine's workers hauled gravel to the site, created firebreaks and blocked manholes as burning oil spread into the town's storm sewer system.|$|E
