Catalan workers made a simple sauce (salsa) <b>with</b> <b>cilantro,</b> oil, vinegar and salt, called Pebre for its main ingredient the ají. Probably due to the lack of ingredients like pine nuts and roasted almonds this could be a variation of the Romesco sauce, a Catalan bell pepper sauce.|$|E

50|$|The {{finished}} {{preparation is}} dry: individual chunks of vegetables are {{coated with a}} thin layer of spice and oil but retain their shape: the contents of the dish must therefore be stirred relatively infrequently during the cooking. Crisp vegetables such as bean pods must ideally retain a little of their crunchy texture. To ensure that no individual component is overcooked, the vegetables may need to be cooked in stages: the root vegetables and eggplant are half-cooked before adding the quick-cooking bean pods and ripe plantain. The finished dish is garnished <b>with</b> chopped <b>cilantro</b> leaf and lemon or lime juice before serving.|$|R
