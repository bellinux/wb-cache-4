The club was formed because of the Super League war, which was the rivalry between the traditional Australian Rugby League competition and the new media driven Super League competition. The team competed in the inaugural and only Super League season in 1997, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> year's World Club Challenge.|$|E

5|$|Active {{military}} service was a long-held dream for Pierce, who had admired his father's and brothers' service in his youth, particularly {{his older brother}} Benjamin's, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of John McNeil Jr., husband of Pierce's older half-sister Elizabeth. As a legislator, he was a passionate advocate for volunteer militias. As a militia officer himself, he had experience mustering and drilling bodies of troops. When Congress declared war against Mexico in May 1846, Pierce immediately volunteered to join, although no New England regiment yet existed. His hope {{to fight in the}} Mexican-American War was one reason he refused an offer to become Polk's Attorney General. General Zachary Taylor's advance slowed in northern Mexico, and General Winfield Scott proposed capturing the port of Vera Cruz and driving overland to Mexico City. Congress passed a bill authorizing the creation of ten regiments, and Pierce was appointed colonel and commander of the 9th Infantry Regiment in February 1847, with Truman B. Ransom as lieutenant colonel and second-in-command.|$|E

He ended Alley's military career, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of every other senior officer, and named Alley commissioner of the National Oil Wells (SNADAH), a role with very little responsibility.

5|$|During Edward's reign, Stigand was an {{influential}} advisor at court {{and used his}} position to increase his own wealth as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> {{of his friends and}} family. Contemporary valuations of the lands he controlled at the death of King Edward, as listed in Domesday Book, come to an annual income of about 2500 pounds. There is little evidence, however, that he enriched either Canterbury or Winchester. He also appointed his followers to sees within his diocese in 1058, having Siward named Bishop of Rochester and Æthelric installed as Bishop of Selsey. Between his holding of two sees and the appointment of his men to other sees in the southeast of England, Stigand was an important figure in defending the coastline against invasion.|$|E

Limantour, who broadly agreed with Estañol, had the support of the Mexican financiers, who feared the downgrading of Mexican international credit and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of the large landowners who were willing to come to terms with Madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings.|$|E

When the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812 ended, Ignatios {{was forced to}} resign and leave Bucharest and its main sponsor, the Philological Society, ceased to exist. In an announcement published as an appendix to the issues of 1813 (dated April 1, 1813), Alexandros Vasileiou, a supporter of Korais and influential personality within the Greek community of Vienna, states this fact, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> the periodical had too few subscribers. He therefore called on all readers to canvass for new subscribers; moreover he called upon all scholars to send in their contributions.|$|E

This provoked the reaction of various provincial governors as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of powerful interest groups in Baghdad itself, such as the caliphal bodyguards. Against them, Ibn Ra'iq employed Bajkam and his Turkish supporters. With their aid, he managed to neutralize the Hujari and Saji guard units, after which, in February 937, Bajkam was rewarded with the posts of sahib al-shurta (chief of police) and governor of the eastern provinces.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the fall of Gush Etzion, news of Degania's {{successful}} stand (as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of Kfar Darom) provided a morale boost for other Israeli villages.

The success of the Napoleonchik field cannons prompted the Israeli high command to re-use two of them in attempts to capture Latrun. The flight from Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan, on the other hand, stirred controversy in the young state, fueled by news of the Kfar Etzion massacre just days before, and the Palmach issued a newsletter accusing them of abandoning national assets, among other things. These accusations were subsequently repeated in media and in a play by Yigal Mossensohn, and a campaign was started by the villagers to clear their name.|$|E

5|$|On 1 April 1899, the German {{government}} took formal control, establishing a protectorate. A treaty with Spain, signed on 30 July, ensured German control over several other island {{groups in the}} Pacific, and these {{were added to the}} protectorate of German New Guinea. The economic life of German New Guinea's small population of European and Asian settlers, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of its Melanesian population, relied heavily on the export of copra and the import of goods and services. It remained a modest outpost, and by August 1914 only 1,273 Europeans lived in the colony, while there was also a small but significant number of Japanese, Chinese and Malays.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday 30 September, {{the body}} of prostitute Elizabeth Stride was {{discovered}} at about 1am in Dutfield's Yard, inside the gateway of 40 Berner Street (since renamed Henriques Street), Whitechapel. She was lying {{in a pool of}} blood with her throat cut from left to right. She had been killed just minutes before, and her body was otherwise unmutilated. It is possible that the murderer was disturbed before he could commit any mutilation of the body by someone entering the yard, perhaps Louis Diemschutz, who discovered the body. However, some commentators on the case conclude that Stride's murder was unconnected to the others on the basis that the body was unmutilated, that it was the only murder to occur south of Whitechapel Road, and that the blade used might have been shorter and of a different design. Most experts, however, consider the similarities in the case distinctive enough to connect Stride's murder with at least two of the earlier ones, as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of Catherine Eddowes on the same night.|$|E
