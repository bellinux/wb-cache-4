60|$|He <b>walked</b> <b>me</b> {{up to my}} room {{slowly and}} gravely--I am certain he had a delight in that formal parade of {{executing}} justice--and when we got there, suddenly twisted my head under his arm.|$|E

6000|$|She {{looked all}} round {{the room in}} a glaring manner, and then said, leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, [...] "Come, come, come! <b>Walk</b> <b>me,</b> <b>walk</b> me!" ...|$|R

[...] "The young ladies <b>walked</b> <b>me</b> {{down to the}} rocks in the usual way after dinner, and then I came back and talked paint with Mr. Lapham till midnight. We didn't settle {{anything}} till this morning {{coming up on the}} boat." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{took me by}} the arm, and <b>walked</b> <b>me</b> {{away with}} him along the road by which he had come. I dare say I had {{deserved}} his reproof--but I {{was not going to}} help him to set traps for Rosanna Spearman, for all that. Thief or no thief, legal or not legal, I don't care--I pitied her.|$|E
6000|$|... "He rose. I took it he {{was coming}} round the counter to get the book out. Instead, he came {{straight}} up to me. He was a biggish sort of man.

60|$|If I had had any {{breath to}} answer with, I dare say I {{should have made}} no answer; having no breath, I {{certainly}} made none. Miss Griffin and the strange man took me between them, and <b>walked</b> <b>me</b> back to the palace {{in a sort of}} state; but not at all (as I couldn't help feeling, with astonishment) in culprit state.|$|E
6000|$|I felt caught, and {{a little}} embarrassed; but I laughed, {{and said it was}} a habit of mine when I {{was in a state of}} expenctancy. But he didn't seem quite satisfied; and from that time on he began to show uneasiness. Four times he <b>walked</b> <b>me</b> up the road to a point whence we could see a long distance; and there he would stand, shading his eyes with his hand, and looking. Several times he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{that was}} when he set me to make a pudden, for because our cook was hurted. I done my uttermost, but she all fetched adrift like in the bag, an' the more I biled the bits of her, the less she favoured any fashion o' pudden. Moon he chawed and chammed his piece, and Frankie chawed and chammed his'n, and--no words to it--he took me by the ear an' <b>walked</b> <b>me</b> out over the bow-end, an' him an' Moon hove the pudden at me on the {{bowsprit}} gub by gub, something cruel hard!' Simon rubbed his hairy cheek.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Luna {{looked at}} him with a {{suspended}} needle. [...] "Well! have you forgotten that too? You told me yourself you thought it so pretty, that time in Boston, when you <b>walked</b> <b>me</b> up the hill." [...] Ransom declared that he remembered that walk, but didn't remember everything he had said to her; and she suggested, very satirically, that perhaps he would like to marry Verena himself--he seemed so interested in her. Ransom shook his head sadly, and said he was afraid he was {{not in a position to}} marry; whereupon Mrs. Luna asked him what he meant--did he mean (after a moment's hesitation) that he was too poor? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I left 'em singing hymns and I {{went down}} to old Conrad Gerhard. He wasn't at all {{surprised}} when I told him I was young Gert Schwankfelder that was. He knew Toby. His wife she <b>walked</b> <b>me</b> into the back-yard without a word, and she washed me and she cut my hair {{to the edge of}} a basin, and she put me to bed, and oh! how I slept--how I slept in that little room behind the oven looking on the flower garden! I didn't know Toby went to the Embuscade that night and bought me off Dr Karaguen for twelve dollars and a dozen bottles of Seneca Oil. Karaguen wanted a new lace to his coat, and he reckoned I hadn't long to live; so he put me down as [...] "discharged sick." ...|$|E
60|$|The Countess <b>walked</b> <b>me</b> gently {{round the}} fish-pond. I {{expected}} to be made the depositary of some extraordinary confidence, and I was astonished to find that Madame Fosco's communication for my private ear {{was nothing more than}} a polite assurance of her sympathy for me, after what had happened in the library. Her husband had told her of all that had passed, and of the insolent manner in which Sir Percival had spoken to me. This information had so shocked and distressed her, on my account and on Laura's, that she had made up her mind, if anything of the sort happened again, to mark her sense of Sir Percival's outrageous conduct by leaving the house. The Count had approved of her idea, and she now hoped that I approved of it too.|$|E

There was a little chocolate-brown fat man in a dress suit, with his face shining with joy as he swelled himself and skipped about the floor. Danged if Denver hadn't made General Rompiro head waiter of the Hotel Brunswick!" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} be the police-officer who had said so; for it was he who replied, Yes! It was he, too, who finally took me by the arm, and <b>walked</b> <b>me</b> before him through the streets, into a {{whitewashed}} room in a bare building, where I had a chair to sit in, a table to sit at, an iron bedstead and good mattress to lie upon, and a rug and blanket to cover me. Where I had enough to eat too, and was shown how to clean the tin porringer in which it was conveyed to me, until it was as good as a looking-glass. Here, likewise, I was put in a bath, and had new clothes brought to me; and my old rags were burnt, and I was camphored and vinegared and disinfected in a variety of ways.|$|E
60|$|We {{went into}} all the schools of the college, and made {{ourselves}} fully aware {{that the amount of}} learning imparted was far above our comprehension. It always occurs to me, in looking through the new schools of the present day, that I ought to be thankful to persons who know so much for condescending to speak to me at all in plain English. I said a word to the gentleman who was with me about horses, seeing a lot of lads going to their riding lesson. But he was down upon me, and crushed me instantly beneath the weight of my own ignorance. He <b>walked</b> <b>me</b> up to the image of a horse, which he took to pieces, bit by bit, taking off skin, muscle, flesh, nerves, and bones, till the animal was a heap of atoms, and assured me that the anatomy of the horse throughout was one of the necessary studies of the place. We afterward went to see the riding. The horses themselves were poor enough. This was accounted for by the fact that such of them as had been found fit for military service had been taken {{for the use of the}} army.|$|E
6000|$|... 16.--We {{have had}} a {{successful}} day. The drive each way was a treat in itself, and the moon rising over the sea on our way home was a sight never to be forgotten. Hollybridge is charming in itself. Those grounds with their sea-board are unique, and I never saw such Spanish chestnuts in England. Then the gardens and the turf! One must have lived as long in foreign parts as we have to appreciate the perfect finish and well-tended look of such places. Your dear old chief does not quite agree. He says he wants space, and is oppressed {{with the sense of}} hedges and fences, except when he looks to the sea, and even there the rocks look polished off, and treated by landscape gardeners! He <b>walked</b> <b>me</b> about to see the show places, and look at the pictures, saying he had been so well lionised that he wanted some one to discharge his information upon. It was great fun to hear him criticising the impossibilities of a battle-piece-- Blenheim, I think--the anachronisms of the firearms and uniforms, and the want of discipline around Marlborough, who would never have won a battle at that rate. You know how his hawk's eye takes note of everything. He looked at Metelill and said, [...] "Uncommonly pretty girl that, and knows it," [...] but when I asked what he thought of Isabel's looks, he said, [...] "Pretty, yes; but are you sure she is quite aboveboard? There's something I don't like about her eyes." [...] I wish he had not said so. I know {{there is a kind of}} unfriendly feeling towards her among some of the girls, especially the Druces and Charley. I have heard Charley openly call her a humbug, but I have thought much of this was dislike to the softer manners, and perhaps jealousy of my notice, and the expression that the old lord noticed is often the consequence of living in an uncongenial home.|$|E
