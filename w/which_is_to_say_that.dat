5|$|With ample {{current density}} and ionization, this forms a {{luminous}} electric arc (a continuous electric discharge similar to lightning) between the electrodes. Electrical resistance along the continuous electric arc creates heat, which dissociates more gas molecules and ionizes the resulting atoms (where degree of ionization {{is determined by}} temperature), and as per the sequence: solid-liquid-gas-plasma, the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma. A thermal plasma is in thermal equilibrium, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and electrons. This is so because when thermal plasmas are generated, electrical energy is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by elastic collision (without energy loss) to the heavy particles.|$|E

25|$|Criminal Law is {{the body}} of law that relates to crime. It proscribes conduct {{perceived}} as threatening, harmful, or otherwise endangering to the property, health, safety, and moral welfare of people. Most criminal law is established by statute, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the laws are enacted by a legislature. It includes the punishment of people who violate these laws. Criminal law varies according to jurisdiction, and differs from civil law, where emphasis is more on dispute resolution and victim compensation than on punishment.|$|E
25|$|In the {{controversial}} matter of interpreting prophecy {{such as that}} in the Book of Daniel, Calvin proposed a preterist view, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{he believed that the}} prophecies in the book of Daniel apply only to the history between prophet Daniel (530 BC) and Jesus' first coming (30 AD). In this view he was out of line with the early church and the Reformers who came before him, who maintained more fully to historical-continuous view. Calvin is also in distinction to many of his later successors who look a future fulfillment.|$|E
25|$|Apollinaire took Picasso to {{the opening}} of the {{exhibition}} in 1911 to see the cubist works in Room 7 and 8. At about the time of this exhibition, Gleizes, through the intermediary of Apollinaire, meets Picasso and sees the work of Picasso and Braque for the first time. He gives his reaction in an essay published in another shortlived Abbaye dominated literary magazine, La Revue Indépendante. He considers that Picasso and Braque, despite the great value of their work, are engaged in an 'Impressionism of Form', <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they give an appearance of formal construction which does not rest on any clearly comprehensible principle.|$|E

25|$|If the point, A {{had been}} chosen {{to the right of}} the {{azeotrope}} rather than to the left, the distillate at point C would be farther to the right than A, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the distillate would be richer in X and poorer in Y than the original mixture. So in this case too, the distillate moves away from the azeotrope and the residue moves toward it. This is characteristic of negative azeotropes. No amount of distillation, however, can make either the distillate or the residue arrive on the opposite side of the azeotrope from the original mixture. This is characteristic of all azeotropes.|$|E
25|$|The Calvinist atonement {{is called}} {{definite}} by some {{because they believe}} it certainly secures the salvation of those for whom Christ died, and it is called {{limited in its extent}} because it effects salvation for the elect only. Calvinists do not believe the power of the atonement is limited in any way, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> no sin is too great to be expiated by Christ's sacrifice, in their view. Among English Calvinistic (Particular) Baptists, the doctrine was usually known as particular redemption, giving its adherents the name Particular Baptists. This term emphasizes the intention of God to save particular persons through the atonement, as opposed to mankind in general as General Baptists believe.|$|E
500|$|That change, from probabilities to {{probability}} amplitudes, {{complicates the}} mathematics without changing the basic approach. But {{that change is}} still not quite enough because it fails {{to take into account}} the fact that both photons and electrons can be polarized, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> their orientations in space and time have to be taken into account. Therefore, P(A to B) actually consists of 16 complex numbers, or probability amplitude arrows.

500|$|... 343 Guilty Spark (or Guilty Spark) (voiced by Tim Dadabo) is a robot {{character}} who {{appears in the}} original Halo trilogy. 343 Guilty Spark is an artificial intelligence designed to serve Forerunners. His identity module was sourced from a human named Chakas, who was composed by the Didact, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he was digitized {{at the expense of}} his biological form. Guilty Spark was fragmented into several independently operating fragments, one of which was uploaded in the familiar, floating, blue-eyed, geometric orb, first encountered in Halo: Combat Evolved, and assigned to Installation 04 (codenamed Alpha Halo) under the title of Monitor. Although an identity module is required for an artificial intelligence to operate, it may occasionally lead to complications arising from free will – for example, the containment of a Flood outbreak should always assume the highest priority for a Monitor; however, in a moment of weakness he disregarded his assigned prioritization, in favour of preserving the structural integrity of the replacement Installation.|$|E

All of <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> 'Sweet Dreams' is just like every amazingly crazy Beyoncé video from the past three years, which — to extend the point — also means that it's pretty great." [...] Olivia Smith of Daily News noted that in the video, Knowles references Jane Fonda in the movie Barbarella (1968), Tin Woodman and Pamela Anderson through the different costumes she wears. Smith further compared the video with the one for [...] "Single Ladies", writing that Knowles reprises some of the moves as she [...] "can only swivel those hips in so many ways". Brandon Soderberg of Slant Magazine described {{the introductory part of}} the video as a David Lynch-like mixture of eroticism and symbolism. He {{wrote that the}} video was [...] "one part Victoria's Secret commercial, another part dream logic anti-narrative, and a CGI-assisted freakout all around". Soderberg commended the video for being [...] "an excess of body and action, not filmic techniques", adding that the dancing in the video [...] "blow our minds anew".|$|E
