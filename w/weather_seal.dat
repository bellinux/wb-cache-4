50|$|The {{most common}} use, however, is {{probably}} in vehicles. It {{is used in}} door seals, window seals, trunk seals, and sometimes hood seals. Frequently, these seals {{are the source of}} noise due to movement of the door against the car body and the resulting friction between the EPDM rubber and the mating surface (painted sheet metal or glass). This can be alleviated using specialty coatings that are applied at the time of manufacture of the <b>weather</b> <b>seal.</b> Such coatings can also greatly increase the chemical resistance of EPDM rubber. Some vehicle manufacturers also recommend a light application of silicone dielectric grease to weatherstripping to reduce noise. Other uses in vehicles include cooling system circuit hoses where water pumps, thermostats, EGR valves, EGR coolers, heaters, oil coolers, radiators, and degas bottles are connected with EPDM hoses, as well as charge air tubing on turbocharged engines to connect the cold side of the charge air cooler (intercooler) to the intake manifold.|$|E

50|$|The Pentax K-500 is an {{entry-level}} sibling of the Pentax K-50, sharing {{almost all}} of its features. The main {{differences between the two}} cameras are the K-500's lack of colored body options (only black), electronic level, <b>weather</b> <b>sealing,</b> and focus point visualisation through the optical viewfinder. As a consequence of the lack of <b>weather</b> <b>sealing,</b> this camera is bundled with the non-weather-sealed DA L 18-55mm kit lens, and most variants of the camera come with an AA battery holder included as opposed to the D-Li109 rechargeable Li-ion battery included with the K-50. However, the camera is still compatible with the aforementioned Li-ion battery.|$|R
50|$|The HD PENTAX-D FA 150-450mm F4.5-5.6 ED DC AW is a super-telezoom lens for Pentax K-mount. Optically, it {{features}} extra low dispersion (ED) elements {{as well as}} HD, SP (Super Protect) and Bright Aero coatings. It is <b>weather</b> <b>sealed</b> and supports quick shift.|$|R
50|$|Compact {{digital cameras}} are fitted with fixed lenses, {{which makes it}} harder for dust to get into the image area. Similar film cameras are often only {{light-tight}} and not environmentally sealed. Some modern DSLRs, like the Olympus E-3, incorporate extensive dust and <b>weather</b> <b>seals</b> to avoid this problem.|$|R
50|$|The {{model was}} aimed {{at a lower price}} point in the market than the {{preceding}} OM-D E-M5 and OM-D E-M1 models. Some features of the previous models were not included, such as <b>weather</b> <b>sealing</b> and the E-M10 had only a 3-way image stabiliser instead of the other models' 5-way stabiliser.|$|R
50|$|In June 2013 Pentax {{announced}} the successors to the K-30, the K-50 and K-500. Both are mid-level DSLRs, the K-500 being a stripped-down {{version of the}} K-50, having no <b>weather</b> <b>seals</b> and less-advanced electronics. Pentax K-500 uses 4 AA batteries (rechargeable Lithium battery is optional), while Pentax K-50 uses rechargeable Lithium battery.|$|R
50|$|Other {{additions}} on the Canon 40D include interchangeable focusing screens, an AF-ON button, the EOS Integrated Cleaning System for sensor dust reduction, rubber strips {{around the}} battery and CF doors for improved <b>weather</b> <b>sealing</b> and three new optional accessories: an IS {{version of the}} 18-55mm kit lens; a new backward-compatible, live view mode, and a weather-sealed battery grip.|$|R
50|$|Canon has {{rated the}} shutter {{durability}} of the Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III and Canon EOS-1D Mark III at 300,000 cycles, {{significantly more than}} other EOS cameras. The 1Ds Mark III also has a new EOS Integrated Cleaning System that removes dust automatically. The camera is <b>weather</b> <b>sealed</b> against moisture. The camera beeps if the door is opened while images are being written.|$|R
50|$|The EF 200-400mm 4L IS USM Extender 1.4× is a EF mount super {{telephoto}} {{zoom lens}} produced by Canon. It {{is part of}} the professional L-series and functions with the Canon EOS line of cameras. The EF 200-400mm lens features an ultrasonic motor, image stabilization and <b>weather</b> <b>sealing.</b> It is the first and only EF lens with a built-in extender.|$|R
50|$|The smc Pentax-DA* 55mm f/1.4 SDM lens is a {{professional}} prime lens for the Pentax K-mount. It is designed for portrait use with a 35mm equivalent focal length of 82.5mm. The lens features <b>weather</b> <b>sealing,</b> an SDM ultrasonic motor for quiet autofocus, and has 9 rounded diaphragm blades for smoother bokeh. Autofocus speed is similar to an equivalent screwdrive lens.|$|R
40|$|A <b>weather</b> <b>sealing</b> band used in {{building}} construction, especially on pitched roofs as an under-tile roofing felt, is novel in comprising a polyamide sheet. Its mean vapour diffusion resistance is expressed as an air layer equivalent diffusion thickness of 0. 1 - 0. 5 m. Preferably the actual sheet thickness is 20 - 250 mu m, especially 50 - 150 mu m. The polyamide is PA 6 or PA 6. 6. It is thermally stabilised {{and may be}} mixed with a copolymer. UV stabilisation is included, together with fibre reinforcement. USE -Used as a nylon <b>weather</b> <b>sealing</b> band for external use, especially as an under-tile roofing felt on pitched roofs. ADVANTAGE - The band has improved water (vapour) resistance {{under a variety of}} climatic conditions. It can be produced by an extrusion process. Incorporation of a copolymer inhibits tear propagation. The UV inhibitor can be simply carbon black. Glass or plastic fibres are usefully incorporated for reinforcement...|$|R
50|$|The EF 100 mm 2.8L Macro IS USM lens is {{the second}} macro lens in the Canon L series. It {{incorporates}} IS, improved build quality, <b>weather</b> <b>sealing,</b> and a new lens configuration resulting in improved MTF plots. This is the first lens on the market to incorporate Canon's new Hybrid Image Stabilization Technology. Hybrid IS effectively compensates for both angular and shift camera shake during close-up shooting.|$|R
50|$|The K-m is {{considered}} a compact and entry-level model. It is significantly lighter than other Pentax DSLRs, lacks the <b>weather</b> <b>sealing</b> of the contemporaneous K200D and K20D models, and {{is intended to be}} sold with lightweight DA-L-series lenses. It does offer some improvements over the K200D, however, notably a maximum sensitivity increased from ISO 1600 to ISO 3200 and a slightly faster burst mode.|$|R
5000|$|While not a {{fault of}} the {{software}} itself, a building is often not constructed as drawn on the plans and some items (<b>weather</b> <b>sealing,</b> insulation values, window coverings, paint colours, etc.) are often different from what was originally simulated. In other unintentional cases, items are installed but are installed incorrectly {{in a way that}} compromises their thermal performance (such as foil-based insulation without an air gap).|$|R
50|$|The Nikon F90x (known in the United States as the N90s) was a {{slightly}} upgraded {{version of the}} F90. Differences included faster and more accurate autofocus and shutter speed adjustments in thirds of a stop versus the full-stop increments of the F90. Frame rate was also increased, along with several other minor upgrades. <b>Weather</b> <b>sealing</b> was also improved. In addition, it eliminated the beeping function of the F90.|$|R
5000|$|The f/4 non-IS version, {{the least}} {{expensive}} L-series lens Canon makes, is popular among weight-sensitive landscape photographers and hobbyists who want L lens quality without spending thousands of dollars. The f/2.8 versions are popular among event photographers and photojournalists where the lower light capabilities are required; some portrait photographers also prefer this lens for the improved background blur produced by the f/2.8 aperture. The non-IS f/2.8 version was released in 1995 and replaced the EF 80-200mm f/2.8L lens. The IS version lenses use circular eight-bladed diaphragms which maintain a nearly circular aperture when stopped down by up to two stops. The f/2.8 and f/4.0 image-stabilized versions also feature <b>weather</b> <b>sealing</b> (resistance to dust and water) when mated to a weather-sealed camera to such as the Canon EOS 1D-series bodies. <b>Weather</b> <b>sealed</b> Canon products are not completely sealed from the environment, they are merely more resistant than non-sealed versions. These lenses are compatible with the Canon Extender EF teleconverters. Due to its internal zooming mechanism, there is never any [...] "lens creep" [...] when pointing this lens at the ground.|$|R
50|$|The DA* lenses are {{designed}} for use with Pentax digital SLR cameras. DA* lenses have higher quality optics and feature {{a higher level of}} <b>weather</b> <b>sealing</b> (AW) than most DA lenses (WR). The DA* lenses are more expensive and generally feature improved light transmission and larger aperture openings for better low light performance. Some DA* lenses also feature both body driven screw drive focusing and the Pentax SDM (Supersonic Drive Motor) lens based focus mechanism.|$|R
50|$|One {{feature the}} EOS-1N (and previous/subsequent '1' models) lacks, which lower {{models in the}} range have, is {{built-in}} flash, intentionally omitted to provide an overall very rigid camera body able to withstand severe treatment by professionals. <b>Weather</b> <b>sealing</b> was incorporated after feedback from working professionals. Other notable omissions are the eye-controlled focus feature of the EOS 5 and the bar code reader of the EOS 10, neither of which are professional-level cameras.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} EOS-1 {{was launched}} in 1989. It was the company's first professional-level EOS camera and was aimed at the same photographers who had used Canon's highly respected, manual focus professional FD mount SLRs, such as the Canon New F-1 and the Canon T90. On a physical level the EOS-1 resembled the T90, which had been designed for Canon by Luigi Colani. The EOS-1 had a single centrally-mounted autofocus point, plus basic <b>weather</b> <b>sealing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The F4 was {{the first}} Nikon F-series lacking a manual film-advance lever, though it offered both {{motor-driven}} and manual film rewinding. Like previous F-series cameras, the F4 featured {{a high degree of}} customization to specific tasks, with various remote controls, film backs, and viewfinders available. While it was a complex camera with over 1700 parts, the F4's high-quality mechanical and electronic components, as well as <b>weather</b> <b>sealing</b> and tough construction, made for a reliable and long-lived professional SLR.|$|R
50|$|The M.Zuiko Digital ED 40-150mm f/2.8 PRO is a Micro Four Thirds System lens by Olympus Corporation, {{sold as a}} {{standalone}} item. It is {{the first}} superzoom lens in the Olympus PRO range, which are constant-aperture, weather-sealed, metal-bodied lenses intended to accompany the higher end <b>weather</b> <b>sealed</b> OMD bodies such as the EM-1. It features an integrated lens function button (function selectable through the camera menu system), an integrated tripod mount, and an integrated removable lens hood.|$|R
5000|$|On January 23, 2008, Pentax {{announced}} the K20D and K200D, which replaced the K10D and K100D series respectively. [...] The K20D featured a Samsung 14.6 megapixel CMOS APS-C sized sensor, a special 21 frame/s burst mode, live preview on the LCD display, {{and an increased}} sensitivity range extending to ISO 3200. The K200D adopted the 10 megapixel sensor and <b>weather</b> <b>sealing</b> of the K10D, among other improvements, while retaining the smaller body size of the K100D Super.|$|R
5000|$|Starting in the 2000s, {{a number}} of {{companies}} introduced products to address these issues. In these systems, the junction box was sealed and two wires were permanently attached to it using strain reliefs. The cables ended with push-fit connectors that met the definition of a [...] "convenience receptacle", meaning they could be (legally) connected together by anyone. Two connectors became somewhat common during this period, the Radox connector and MC3 connector, both of which essentially looked like <b>weather</b> <b>sealed</b> phono jacks.|$|R

50|$|The EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM lens {{is often}} {{compared}} to the other L series zoom of comparable range, the 24-70mm f/2.8L USM, losing one full stop but gaining image stabilization (IS) in return, stabilizing camera shake up to three stops. It also has rubber gaskets for moisture and dust protection, although <b>weather</b> <b>sealing</b> is only effective if the photographer uses a weather-resistant camera body. Some early production models of the EF 24-105mm f/4L IS USM lens had a flare problem (reportedly the first 10,000 batch) and Canon offered to repair them for free.|$|R
50|$|It is {{actually}} a range of two slightly different lenses based on a common design: the Sports and Contemporary. Both lenses feature similar specifications, {{but there are some}} notable differences. The Sports model has better <b>weather</b> <b>sealing,</b> more lens elements, a larger size and weight and slightly better optical performance at towards the 600 mm end of its zoom range. The Contemporary model, on the other hand, is built to a cheaper price point but features similar performance. Its performance suffers a little more than the Sport model between 300-600 mm.|$|R
5000|$|Top range Canon EF lenses are {{designated}} [...] "L-series", or [...] "Luxury" [...] lenses. L series lenses {{are compatible with}} {{the full range of}} EF or EF-S mounts and as they are aimed at the high-end user, most also include environmental or <b>weather</b> <b>sealing</b> and a constant maximum aperture. All L lenses are supplied complete with a hood and pouch, which are not included with non-L lenses. Distinctive visual cues include a red ring around the lens and an off-white colour on longer-focal-length models. The latter also helps to reflect light and reduce heat absorption.|$|R
