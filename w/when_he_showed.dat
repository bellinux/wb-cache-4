After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> up in Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength needed to kill Itachi. When Tsunade finds out, she sends a group of ninja, including Naruto, to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to persuade or force him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not give up on Sasuke: Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare himself for {{the next time he}} encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes Tsunade's apprentice.|$|E

His next call was traced to a phone booth near a restaurant where he was working and he was arrested the following day <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> up for work.|$|E
25|$|While at university, Gauss {{independently}} rediscovered {{several important}} theorems. His breakthrough occurred in 1796 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> that a regular polygon {{can be constructed}} by compass and straightedge {{if the number of}} its sides is the product of distinct Fermat primes and a power of 2. This was a major discovery in an important field of mathematics; construction problems had occupied mathematicians {{since the days of the}} Ancient Greeks, and the discovery ultimately led Gauss to choose mathematics instead of philology as a career.|$|E

25|$|The first {{substantial}} experimental {{challenges to}} caloric theory arose in Rumford's 1798 work, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> that boring cast iron cannons produced great amounts of heat which he ascribed to friction, {{and his work}} {{was among the first}} to undermine the caloric theory. The development of the steam engine also focused attention on calorimetry and the amount of heat produced from different types of coal. The first quantitative research on the heat changes during chemical reactions was initiated by Lavoisier using an ice calorimeter following research by Joseph Black on the latent heat of water.|$|E
25|$|The Higgs {{particle}} is {{a massive}} scalar elementary particle theorized by Peter Higgs in 1964 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> Goldstone's 1962 theorem (generic continuous symmetry which is spontaneously broken) provides a third polarisation of a massive vector field. Hence, Goldstone's original scalar doublet, the massive spin-zero particle, was proposed as the Higgs boson. (see 1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers) and is a key building block in the Standard Model. It has no intrinsic spin, {{and for that reason}} is classified as a boson (like the gauge bosons, which have integer spin).|$|E
25|$|In {{the ensuing}} altercation, one officer, Phillip Cardillo, {{was shot at}} close range with his own gun. Another officer's gun was missing, never to be recovered. Police {{reinforcements}} arrived, as did the news media, and word spread throughout the neighborhood {{that the police had}} committed some outrage in the mosque that they were trying to cover up. An angry and restless crowd had gathered as the police secured the inside of the mosque and tried to figure out what had happened. Two men were arrested and the other worshippers were in custody. Seedman was planning to interrogate them <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> up.|$|E

One on Brother Rays uncle, another on Johnny Rodz. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> the {{footage of the}} LAX beatdown on Rodz, he was confronted by Brother Ray. Before a fight could breakout, the LAX {{attempted}} to attack Brother Ray. When it seemed Ray had the upper hand, however, Kevin Nash distracted him, allowing Shelley to hit him with a low blow. At Destination X 2007 Shelley helped LAX win the match by hitting Brother Devon with a video camera and giving him a Frog Splash through a table.|$|E
25|$|Speck had frequented Frank's Place, and {{the empty}} hog house {{was one of several}} he had helped build in the {{preceding}} month, so Monmouth police briefly questioned him about Pierce's death <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> up to collect his final carpentry paycheck on April 15 and asked him to stay in town for further questioning. When police showed up at the Christy Hotel on April 19 to continue questioning Speck, they found he had left the hotel a few hours earlier, carrying his suitcases and saying he was just going to the laundromat. He had instead left town. A search of his room turned up a radio and costume jewelry Mrs. Virgil Harris had reported missing from her house, as well as items reported missing in two other local burglaries in the past month.|$|E
25|$|Seminoles {{were still}} {{scattered}} {{throughout most of}} Florida. One band that {{had been reduced to}} starvation surrendered in northern Florida near the Apalachicola River in 1842. Further east, however, bands led by Halpatter Tustenuggee, Halleck Tustenuggee and Chitto Harjo raided Mandarin and other settlements along the lower (i.e., northern) St. Johns River. On April 19, 1842, a column of 200 soldiers led by First Lieutenant George A. McCall found a group of Seminole warriors in the Pelchikaha Swamp, about thirty miles south of Fort King. There was a brief fire-fight and then the Seminoles disappeared into a hammock. Halleck Tustenuggee was held prisoner <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> up at Fort King for a talk. Part of his band was caught when they visited the fort, and Lieutenant McCall captured the rest of Halleck's band in their camp.|$|E

25|$|Two years later, on a {{scorching}} {{hot summer}} night, Carnehan creeps into the narrator's office. He is a broken man, a crippled beggar clad in rags {{and he tells}} an amazing story. Dravot and Carnehan succeeded in becoming kings: traversing treacherous mountains, finding the Kafirs, mustering an army, taking over villages, and dreaming of building a unified nation and even an empire. The Kafirs (pagans, not Muslims) were impressed by the rifles and Dravot's lack of fear of their idols, and acclaimed him as a god, the reincarnation or descendant of Alexander the Great. They show a whiter complexion than others of the area ("so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands with old friends") implying their ancient lineage to Alexander himself. The Kafirs practised a form of Masonic ritual, and Dravot's reputation was further cemented <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> knowledge of Masonic secrets that only the oldest priest remembered.|$|E
25|$|Aristobulus's feeble health {{gradually}} {{lead his}} remaining reign {{under the control}} of a clique, at the head of which stood Queen Alexandra Salome, his wife. Through his machinations reign, he was led to suspect his favorite brother, Antigonus—whom he had entrusted with a share in the government, and whom he treated almost as a coregent—of designs against him. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> signs of disease, the queen conspired to murder Antigonus. She deceived the king with suggestions that Antigonus was attempting to overthrow him by force. Salome then convinced Antigonus that his king wished to see his new armor, while telling Aristobulus that his brother was coming to kill him. Antigonus was killed by Aristobulus's guards before he could get close to his brother. Days later, Aristobulus died from pain and internal bleeding from an unknown disease, which Jews perceived his death as a sign of God's disgruntlement. The queen released the younger brothers from prison, placing Alexander Jannaeus on the throne.|$|E
25|$|Lee was {{an early}} {{influence}} on physician and human rights activist H. Jack Geiger. They met in 1940 when Geiger, a 14-year-old middle-class Jewish runaway, was backstage at a Broadway production of Native Son. Lee agreed to take Geiger in <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> up at his door in Harlem asking {{for a place to}} stay. With the consent of his parents, Geiger stayed with Lee for over a year. Lee took on the role of surrogate father and introduced Geiger to Langston Hughes, Billy Strayhorn, Richard Wright, and Adam Clayton Powell. Geiger eventually became a journalist, then a doctor who co-founded the first community health center in the United States, Columbia Point Health Center in Dorchester, Massachusetts. He became a founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility and Physicians for Human Rights, and established community health centers in Mississippi and South Africa. Geiger says he would never have moved so deeply in these worlds so quickly if not for his experiences with Canada Lee.|$|E

25|$|Savage {{made his}} return to {{professional}} wrestling at Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's (TNA) Victory Road by confronting Jeff Jarrett. Savage would make his Impact! debut on November 19, where he confronted the Kings of Wrestling. Savage would make one final Impact! appearance on November 26, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> {{up at the end}} of the show leading the force against the King of Wrestling. On December 5 at Turning Point, he teamed up with Jeff Hardy and A.J. Styles to defeat the Kings of Wrestling (Jarrett, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall), in his last in-ring match. The main event of Final Resolution in January 2005 was scheduled to be Jarrett and Savage for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The plan was for Savage to win the championship and then drop it back to Jarrett at the next pay-per-view. On February 18, 2005, however, Savage left TNA due to health concerns and retired from professional wrestling.|$|E
25|$|Henzell also shot some footage {{for what}} was planned as his next film, No Place Like Home, in Harder's aftermath, but he went broke before he could finish the film. Fed up by this, {{and the lack of}} finance for further production, he {{went on to become a}} writer, {{publishing}} his first novel, Power Game, in 1982. Both were meant to complete a planned trilogy of films centring on Ivanhoe Martin. The footage for No Place Like Home was lost. Years later, he came across editing tapes in a lab in New York. Just to have a sense of completion, he worked on the project. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> it to a few friends, their response was enthusiastic. He eventually was able to retrieve the original footage. No Place Like Home was screened for the public at the 31st annual Toronto International Film Festival in September 2006 at the Cumberland Theatre; it was sold out. Film leads Carl Bradshaw (The Harder They Come, Smile Orange, Countryman) and Susan O'Meara attended and answered audience questions with Henzell after the screening. The film was scheduled to be screened at the Flashpoint Film Festival at the beginning of December 2006 in Negril.|$|E

500|$|His {{final game}} for Wales was on 8 March 1913 against Ireland, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> [...] "brilliance and judgment" [...] (according to Townsend Collins) helping to create two tries towards a Welsh 16–13 victory. Geen was {{selected}} to play centre for the first match of the 1914 Home Nations against England at Twickenham but was forced to withdraw due to injury. He was replaced, once again, by Willie Watts, and probably missed out on four more caps for Wales.|$|E
500|$|Heisenberg {{first came}} to Copenhagen in 1924, then {{returned}} to Göttingen in June 1925, shortly thereafter developing the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> his results to Max Born in Göttingen, Born realised that they could best be expressed using matrices. This work {{attracted the attention of}} the British physicist Paul Dirac, who came to Copenhagen for six months in September 1926. Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger also visited in 1926. His attempt at explaining quantum physics in classical terms using wave mechanics impressed Bohr, who believed it contributed [...] "so much to mathematical clarity and simplicity that it represents a gigantic advance over all previous forms of quantum mechanics".|$|E
500|$|Lead {{singer and}} guitarist Mikey Heppner, {{who listened to}} {{progressive}} rock in his youth, wrote things that he initially withheld from the band, because he felt that his bandmates would not understand him - he described his work as being [...] "way too proggy". Despite his initial doubt, they loved his work <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> it to them. Thereafter, Heppner began describing the forthcoming record in progressive rock terms during interviews. He told the Whistler Question that it [...] "is a little more musically complex; deeper into the sort of metal side where we started out from", but that [...] "It still sounds like us". He also told Jam! that the new songs were [...] "leaning toward progressive (rock) territory".|$|E
