By later that day, a hurricane watch was issued {{for the rest of the}} eastern United States to Eastport, Maine. By two hours before Gloria's landfall on Long Island, a hurricane warning was in effect for the same area, after warnings were gradually extended further north. Officials anticipated higher winds and storm surge than what occurred, due to the hurricane weakening as it approached landfall.|$|E

The fight took place on April 8, 2006, at the Thomas and Mack Center in Las Vegas.|$|E
5|$|After her {{sentencing}} Green {{continued to}} maintain that her recall of {{the night of the}} fire was limited. In the summer of 1996, she wrote to her daughter claiming that she had taken more than the recommended doses of her medications that night. Similar letters to Michael Farrar varied from claims that she had no recollection of the night to firmly stating that she was innocent of the arson. She theorized that Margaret Hacker had set fire to the family's house, and reiterated her claim from the show-cause hearing that Tim had been the one to poison his father. Green wrote to author Ann Rule in 1996 asserting that, due to alcohol abuse, she had not had the mental capacity to start a fire. In a later interview with Rule, she blamed her cloudy thinking during the court hearings on her Prozac prescription, and stated that once she <b>was</b> <b>off</b> the drug, her mind became much clearer.|$|E

5|$|After {{undergoing}} substantial repairs, Temeraire {{was employed}} blockading the French fleets and supporting British operations off the Spanish coasts. She {{went out to}} the Baltic in 1809, defending convoys against Danish gunboat attacks, and by 1810 <b>was</b> <b>off</b> the Spanish coast again, helping to defend Cadiz against a French army. Her last action was against the French off Toulon, when she came under fire from shore batteries. The ship returned to Britain in 1813 for repairs, but was laid up. She was converted to a prison ship and moored in the River Tamar until 1819. Further service brought her to Sheerness as a receiving ship, then a victualling depot, and finally a guard ship. The Admiralty ordered her to be sold in 1838, and she was towed up the Thames to be broken up.|$|E
5|$|Further success {{followed}} in early 1777 with {{the capture of}} the 18-gun American privateer General Montgomery. News had reached England that this vessel <b>was</b> <b>off</b> the island of Madeira in March, having sailed from the Port of Philadelphia in February with a crew of 100 men. Levant was sent in pursuit, with her crew sighting the General Montgomery at midday on 8 March. Captain Murray ordered Levant to fly false colours, hoisting a Dutch flag to avoid alerting the privateer's crew. General Montgomery had also disguised herself by flying a British flag. For several hours the Americans allowed Levant to draw near, finally turning to flee when Murray fired a warning shot. A seven-hour chase ensued, extending into the night with the two ships often within musket shot but unable to bring their broadside cannons to bear. At around 1:00am the wind strengthened and Levant was able to overhaul her prey, forcing the out-gunned Americans to surrender. Nine of General Montgomerys crew enlisted aboard Levant, with the remainder being conveyed to Portsmouth where they remained imprisoned in poor conditions {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Bird was quickest with a lap of {{one minute and}} 8.792 seconds, ahead of Rosenqvist in second and di Grassi third. Buemi was fourth-fastest; Robin Frijns was fifth and Piquet sixth. Turvey was seventh-fastest, Vergne eighth, Prost ninth and Maro Engel completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Turvey impacted the chicane's barrier with Adam Carroll and Bird spinning their cars in the fifth turn. Loïc Duval's left-front tyre lost a wheel nut, causing it to become detached and the session was red flagged. As {{a result of the}} red flag to retrieve Duval's tire and the two stoppages seen in the first practice session, the second 45-minute practice period was extended by five minutes. Shortly after the session restarted, Engel stopped at the turn one exit with car problems but a second red flag was not required because he <b>was</b> <b>off</b> the track. Di Grassi pushed hard and went into the turn four wall, damaging his car's front-right corner and rear-end, and yellow flags were waved to warn drivers about the incident.|$|E
