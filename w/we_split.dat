500|$|Davies' {{next project}} after Doctor Who, codenamed More Gay Men, was a spiritual {{successor}} to Queer as Folk {{and would have}} focused on middle-aged gay men in the Manchester gay scene. The show's genesis dates back from 2001, when his friend Carl Austin asked him [...] "why are gay men so glad when <b>we</b> <b>split</b> up?". The show was due to enter into production in 2006, but was indefinitely postponed due {{to the success of}} Doctor Who. Davies continued to develop ideas for the show, and explained a pivotal scene in the premiere to Cook in 2007: ...|$|E

[...] They got {{matching}} tattoos of each other's initials; in Wood's case, a [...] "J" [...] on her left ankle. After a year together, the relationship ended in 2006. Wood later commented that, [...] "We had matching tattoos because we knew our love would last forever. Trouble is, it didn't, things happened, <b>we</b> <b>split.</b> But I don't regret the tattoo. It {{reminds me of a}} great, great period in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz three days after another script idea fell through. [...] Spotnitz noted that [...] "Darin Morgan had left the show but was going to {{contribute}} an episode. And we realized at the eleventh hour that it wasn't going to happen, and we were stuck with nothing. John, Vince and I broke that story in maybe two days. <b>We</b> <b>split</b> up the acts, wrote it in probably another two days, and gave the crew something to prep before Christmas break. That was the worst ever." [...] Carter ended up rewriting the script over the holiday. The initial cut ended up being too long, resulting in a scene introducing Scully's older brother Bill Scully, played by Pat Skipper, being removed. The character, still played by Skipper, would eventually make his first appearance in the fourth-season finale [...] "Gethsemane". The scene which would have established the character was intended to echo a similar scene in the second season episode [...] "One Breath", which featured Don S. Davis as Scully's father. Both scenes featured the actors standing over a supine Scully, wearing white United States Navy dress uniforms. Also deleted from the episode was a kiss between Mulder and Scully, {{which would have been}} the first in the series' run. This was an ad-lib on Anderson and Duchovny's part, and was removed from the episode as it was something Chris Carter felt he wanted to make use of in the series' film adaptation. Such a kiss was eventually deferred to season six's [...] "Triangle".|$|E

500|$|Florey owned no {{camera at}} the time, and {{his efforts to}} obtain one were {{unsuccessful}} until he met Vorkapić. Florey said of their discussion: [...] "I say to Slav, 'Slav, I have an idea but not much money. You have a camera and are a clever painter. Let's make the picture in collaboration and <b>we</b> <b>split</b> the benefit.'" [...] Vorkapić himself claimed to have said: [...] "Florey, you get me 100 dollars and I'll make you a picture in my own kitchen." [...] Vorkapić allowed Florey to borrow a small box camera that he had purchased with the proceeds {{from the sale of}} one of his oil paintings. It was a DeVry camera with one lens, a type that Florey said was sold as a [...] "toy". Florey also had trouble obtaining film, as he found it cost-prohibitive to purchase negative and positive film from film laboratories. However, Florey knew that [...] "film ends", scraps of leftover unexposed film stock, were often discarded after shooting on big budget Hollywood films, so he attempted to persuade filmmakers to give them to him. Camera work had just been completed on The Gaucho, a film starring Douglas Fairbanks, {{and he was able to}} obtain more than 1,000 feet of film from the production in 10- and 20-foot strips. Florey then spliced the film ends together by hand, a process he found time-consuming and frustrating, but one that resulted in the equivalent of a full reel of negative film. Fairbanks, who had previously hired Florey to handle his European public relations, provided financial assistance for the production of A Hollywood Extra. He also gave Florey access to his editing rooms and helped provide him with film ends.|$|E

2500|$|According to Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias, Sub-Zero was {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} character named simply Ninja, a mysterious member of [...] "the Lin Kuei, a legendary clan of Chinese ninja." [...] He wrote that inspiration came from the controversial book The Chinese Ninja Connection by Li Hsing, which [...] "posits historical evidence {{for the existence of}} the Lin Kuei and their influence on the Japanese ninja. I was aware of there being some controversy about the author’s claims. So when <b>we</b> <b>split</b> the character in two for palette swaps, I thought it would be fitting that one was of Chinese origin and the other Japanese to kind of embody the argument." [...] Sub-Zero was then named Tundra, but the name was changed after a member of the design team saw the film The Running Man, in which the first assassin fought by Arnold Schwarzenegger's character used the name, albeit not hyphenated. Midway programmer Josh Tsui portrayed the unmasked younger Sub-Zero in the character's Mortal Kombat II ending.|$|E

2500|$|A crisis arose when Christensen {{was going}} through a palette of emotions, but he could not share them with the other band members as they neither shared Christensen's enthusiasm, nor could {{appreciate}} the unique symbolism of recording in these legendary studios as much as Christensen did. This caused Christensen to turn to his long-time girlfriend Pernille Rosendahl {{in and out of the}} studio, while becoming increasingly estranged from the band. Nielsen and Friis even went as far as labeling the couple as [...] "John and Yoko", referring to the supposed detrimental influence of Yoko Ono on John Lennon, which is said to have contributed to the break-up of the Beatles. This period also showed the first signs of the band members heading in different musical directions, about which Christensen explained in 2000: [...] "I needed change while the others wanted to continue in the same style, and that was actually the most important reason <b>we</b> <b>split</b> up." [...] This is especially evident from the song [...] "Rise and Fall"; although songs were usually a collaborative effort by the band, Christensen requested Nielsen and Friis to allow him to be in full control over this song, and as a result it is distinctly different from all other songs on the album.|$|E
