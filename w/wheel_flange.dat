2500|$|As {{opposed to}} a vehicle riding along a flat circle, {{inclined}} edges add an additional force that keeps the vehicle in its path and prevents a car from being [...] "dragged into" [...] or [...] "pushed out of" [...] the circle (or a railroad wheel from moving sideways so as to nearly rub on the <b>wheel</b> <b>flange).</b> [...] This force is the horizontal component of the vehicle's normal force. In the absence of friction, the normal force {{is the only one}} acting on the vehicle {{in the direction of the}} center of the circle. Therefore, as per Newton's second law, we can set the horizontal component of the normal force equal to mass multiplied by centripetal acceleration: ...|$|E
2500|$|For most {{standardized}} {{model railway}} scales, the nominal scale reduction ratio is not applied systematically {{to all the}} components of a scale model railway, and normally the standards give scale specific design guidelines for all the scales they cover. Reliability of operations requires that certain parts be made oversize. A typical example is the wheel flanges, which must be proportionally higher in smaller scales to ensure that lighter and smaller models do not derail easily as they would if universal flange proportions were used in all the scales. For instance, a Z scale <b>wheel</b> <b>flange</b> as defined in the NEM standard should be about 9% of the scale nominal standard gauge (...) , whereas the same standard gives only 5% for [...] standard gauge I scale.|$|E
2500|$|Fishplates {{are usually}} [...] long, used in pairs {{either side of}} the rail ends and bolted {{together}} (usually four, but sometimes six bolts per joint). The bolts may be oppositely-oriented so that {{in the event of a}} derailment and a <b>wheel</b> <b>flange</b> striking the joint, only some of the bolts will be sheared, reducing the likelihood of the rails misaligning with each other and exacerbating the seriousness of the derailment. This technique is not applied universally, European practice being to have all the bolt heads on the same side of the rail. Small gaps which function as expansion joints are deliberately left between the rail ends to allow for expansion of the rails in hot weather. European practice was to have the rail joints on both rails adjacent to each other, while North American practice is to stagger them.|$|E
50|$|On running round a bend, {{the first}} axle is pushed {{sideways}} by {{the curve of}} the rails and so moves the second axle parallel to it in the opposite direction, until the <b>wheel</b> <b>flanges</b> of both axles align with the rails. This distributes the guide forces between the two axles which reduces wear and tear on the <b>wheel</b> <b>flanges.</b> By enabling this transverse movement of the wheelsets, locomotives with rigid frames do not have to use the thinner <b>wheel</b> <b>flanges</b> etc. normally needed to facilitate smooth running through points, bends and tightly curved sections of track. The 'guide length' of the locomotive is formed by the distance between the two fixed Beugniot lever pivot points.|$|R

2500|$|To {{illustrate}} that a wheelset trajectory follows a curved path, one may place a nail or screw {{on a flat}} table top {{and give it a}} push. [...] It will roll in a curved circle because the nail or screw is like a wheelset with extremely different diameter wheels. [...] The head is analogous to a large diameter wheel and the pointed end is like a small diameter wheel. [...] While the nail or screw will turn around in a full circle (and more) the railroad wheelset behaves differently because as soon at it starts to turn in a curve, the effective diameters change {{in such a way as}} to decrease the curvature of the path. [...] Note that [...] "radius" [...] and [...] "curvature" [...] refer to the curvature of the trajectory of the wheelset and not the curvature of the railway since this is perfectly straight track. [...] As the wheelset rolls on, the curvature decreases until the wheels reach the point where their effective diameters are equal and the path is no longer curving. [...] But the trajectory has a slope at this point (it is a straight line which crosses diagonally over the centerline of the track) so that it overshoots the centerline of the track and the effective diameters reverse (the formerly smaller diameter wheel becomes the larger diameter and conversely). [...] This results in the wheelset moving in a curve in the opposite direction. [...] Again it overshoots the centerline and this phenomenon continues indefinitely with the wheelset oscillating from side to side. [...] Note that the <b>wheel</b> <b>flange</b> never makes contact with the rail. [...] In this model, the rails are assumed to always contact the wheel tread along the same line on the rail head which assumes that the rails are knife-edge and only make contact with the wheel tread along a line (of zero width).|$|E

50|$|The driving axles {{were fixed}} rigidly into the {{locomotive}} frame. To improve curve running the <b>wheel</b> <b>flanges</b> {{of the driving}} wheels were reduced. The carrying axles were designed as Adams axles and had leaf return springs.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} centre pick-up, the Trix Express system also {{retained}} the larger <b>wheel</b> <b>flanges,</b> customary in the 1930s, right till the recent end, making derailments rather uncommon, {{but at the}} same time making their rolling stock incompatible with more modern two-rail NEM systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} with heavy diesels {{was not without}} problems. At the end of 2005, operations had to be suspended {{for a few weeks}} because of damage to the tracks and to the wheel sets. This is possibly the result of using 80-ton and 2060 kW locomotives on the tight curves of this steep section.

50|$|These ten-coupled {{locomotives}} had carrying axles {{housed in}} a Bissel bogie. The fixed third axle acted as the driving axle and had thinner <b>wheel</b> <b>flanges</b> to begin with. After 1945 its flanges were removed entirely to improve curve running still further. The wheelbase was 3,000 mm initially; this was later increased to 4,000 mm.|$|R
50|$|The {{driving and}} coupled wheels were {{fixed to the}} frame. Whether the middle axle had a reduced <b>wheel</b> <b>flange</b> is not known. The drive went to the second axle.|$|E
50|$|The Nadal formula {{assumes the}} wheel remains {{perpendicular}} to the rail - {{it does not take}} into account hunting oscillation of the wheelset, or the movement of the <b>wheel</b> <b>flange</b> contact point against the rail.|$|E
50|$|If {{weld repair}} of side-worn {{switches}} is undertaken, {{it is possible}} for poor workmanship to produce a ramp in the profile in the facing direction, that deflects an approaching <b>wheel</b> <b>flange</b> on to the rail head.|$|E
50|$|As {{the frog}} is used, the {{flangeway}} will abrade against the <b>wheel</b> <b>flanges</b> and deepen. In this case, new wheels (those with shorter flanges) will make contact between tread and frog, creating a combination tread- and flange-bearing loading on the frog. Meanwhile, worn wheels (those with taller flanges) {{will continue to}} impart a fully flange-bearing loading onto the frog.|$|R
50|$|The Nadal formula, {{also called}} Nadal's formula, is an {{equation}} in railway design that relates the downward force exerted by a train's wheels upon the rail, with the lateral {{force of the}} <b>wheel's</b> <b>flange</b> against {{the face of the}} rail. This relationship is significant in railway design, as a wheel-climb derailment may occur if the lateral and vertical forces are not properly considered.|$|R

50|$|If a rail {{has been}} subject to extreme sidewear, or a <b>wheel</b> <b>flange</b> has been worn to an {{improper}} angle, {{it is possible for}} the L/V ratio to exceed the value that the flange angle can resist.|$|E
50|$|A recent {{development}} on North American freight railroads is the flange-bearing frog, {{in which the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>flange</b> supports {{the weight of the}} vehicle as opposed to the tread. This design reduces impact loading and extends the life of the frog.|$|E
50|$|Once the <b>wheel</b> <b>flange</b> has {{completely}} {{climbed onto the}} rail head, there is no lateral restraint, and the wheelset is likely to follow the yaw angle, resulting in the wheel dropping outside the rail. An L/V ratio greater than 0.6 {{is considered to be}} hazardous.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} their {{relatively}} simple design Klien-Lindner axles were not widely used. Derailments were common when they were used as leading axles. The axles often caused uneven, jerky running {{as a result of}} the resistance forces that arise from this type of Cardan joint, and they were expensive to maintain, something which was not offset by the reduced wear and tear on <b>wheel</b> <b>flanges</b> and rails.|$|R
50|$|Looks {{for hunting}} {{oscillation}} of the trucks or wheelset; a lateral {{movement in the}} gauge of the track, like drifting {{back and forth in}} a lane of traffic. This action can increase above a certain speed to the point the <b>wheel</b> <b>flanges</b> impact the rails, potentially causing damage to both. There is also force absorbed by this action that will affect the energy consumption of train operations.|$|R
50|$|Regular rail {{can cross}} its own track because {{the gaps in}} the rails for <b>wheel</b> <b>flanges</b> are narrow, {{permitting}} the bladed design. Round pipe roller coaster rails and box beam monorail rails usually have wheels riding at angles other than on top. These additional other angle wheels are a larger loading gauge, requiring big gaps in the rail (structure gauge) where rails cross or meet.|$|R
