50|$|According to {{more recent}} scholarship, the Hobe family is first {{mentioned}} with the knight Johannes Hobe on 20 May 1278. In 1376 the squire Henningk Hobe was <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deed.</b> With Dietrich (Tiedeke) Hobe the Black (died 1379), lord at Wasdow, the family line begins for certain. Barthold Hobe and Lütke Hoben signed the Union of Mecklenburg Knights in 1523 for the family. Friedrich von Hobe was a Geheimer Rat and chamber president to Gustav Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.|$|E
50|$|The first {{bearer of}} the name, Harte Manus miles de Mondorf, appears {{mentioned}} in February 1214 before Acre in the Kingdom of Jerusalem as a <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deed</b> of {{gift from the}} Wicard of Karlsperg, who transferred one of his Carinthian estates to the St. Johannis hospital in Jerusalem. Besides this Manndorff other members of long-established Carinthian nobility, namely Silberberg, Gurniz and Perneck—who were on a pilgrimage in the Holy land with the Wicard of Karlsperg--, were also witnesses to the deed. The exact origin of this first Manndorff and his ancestors remains unclear.|$|E

50|$|Thomas ap John Dylwyn {{appears as}} <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 1490 <b>deed</b> in Brecon, {{although}} no more {{is known of}} him. Other descendants of Ieuan Deulwyn remained in Carmarthenshire, as evidenced by a 1609 survey of freeholders in the Welshry of Kidwelly.|$|R
50|$|He appears for {{the first}} time in 1297 as one of the <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deed</b> of {{transfer}} of various fiefs by Isabella of Villehardouin, Princess of Achaea, to her sister Margaret. By 1302, he served as captain of the region of Skorta and warden of the Barony of Kalamata for Matilda of Hainaut, who was absent as she had been wed to Guy II de la Roche, Duke of Athens. In 1302/3 he played a leading role in the suppression of the rebellion of the Greeks of the Skorta area, who were aided by the Byzantines of Mystras. After the Byzantines were repulsed, Nicholas installed himself with a strong garrison at Vervena to safeguard Frankish control.|$|R
50|$|In 1280 Brother Philip, {{believed}} to be Philip Fitzurse a descendent of Reginald Fitzurse one of the knights who murdered St Thomas, is a <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deed</b> with several local landowners which include Willelmus de Fissacre. In the church there survives an ancient stone coffin lid, presumed {{to be part of}} his tomb. It is fortunate that Jeremiah Milles in his Parochial Collections of 1755 visited the church, made a drawing and recorded the inscription and lettering of the words on the stone, while it was still possible to read the inscription round the edge of the stone, now scarcely visible. You who pray here for the soul of Philip shall have thirty days pardon as a reward.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} written {{reference to}} Seascale {{is in the}} period 1154-1181, when an Aldwin de Seascale was <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deed</b> made at Wetheral priory. Another early reference is in 1200 in a charter of Roger de Beauchamp to the priory of St. Bees. It states that land he gave to that monastery was near Leseschalis or Seascale, on the western coast. About this time Alan de Coupland and William de Wabyrththwaite granted land to Walter de Sewnyhous in the nearby manor of Bolton, which remained in that family's possession for over 500 years. The present community of Hallsenna is derived from this name, being called Hall Sevenhouse, and later, Hall Senhouse.Seascale {{was part of the}} ancient parish of Gosforth, which was divided into the manors of Gosforth, Boonwood, Bolton High, Bolton Low and Seascale, who jointly elected a churchwarden for Gosforth church.|$|E
5000|$|Sir Ralph Bluett (son), Lord of Ragland. He was <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>deed</b> {{during the}} reign of King Henry III (1216-1272). He is said in the {{traditional}} pedigrees to have married a certain Hawys de Monthermer, sister of [...] "Gilbert (sic) de Monthermer, Earl of Hereford (sic) and Gloucester". No such earl appears to have existed. The Earls of Hertford and Gloucester {{during the reign}} of King Henry III were as follows: Gilbert de Clare, 4th Earl of Hertford, 5th Earl of Gloucester (1180-1230), Richard de Clare, 5th Earl of Hertford, 6th Earl of Gloucester (1222-1262) and Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford, 7th Earl of Gloucester (1243-1295). The Monthermer earldom was later, in the person of Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer (d. 1325), who acquired the earldoms through marriage to Joan of Acre, the widow of the 7th Earl. The armorials of Bluett however show three eagles displayed, similar to the single eagle displayed of Monthermer, quartered by the Earls of Salisbury.|$|E
50|$|He {{was first}} {{recorded}} as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> title <b>deed</b> inscribed on <b>a</b> kudurru after his (presumably) older brothers, Ninurta-kudurrῑ-uṣur, {{who was to}} become his immediate predecessor on the throne, and Rīmūt-ilī, the temple administrator. The Eclectic Chronicle refers laconically to “the Nth year of Mār-bῑti-aḫḫē-idinna” but the context is lost. The Synchronistic King List records him as the third {{in a series of}} kings of Babylon who were contemporary with the Assyrian king, Tukultī-apil-Ešarra II (ca. 967-935 BC), the son of Ashur-resh-ishi II and this is quite plausible based on the chronology.|$|R

5000|$|His {{predecessor}} was Simbar-šipak, c. 1025 to 1008 BC, and the Dynastic Chronicle {{records that}} he “was slain with the sword,” before describing Ea-mukin-zēri as “the usurper (LUGAL IM.GI).” Another person named Ea-mukin-zēri appears as <b>a</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> land <b>deed</b> dated <b>to</b> Simbar-šipak’s twelfth year, but is probably someone else as it records {{that he was}} the son of Belani and was the priest of Eridu. The Synchronistic King List [...] makes him a contemporary of Šamši-Adad IV of Assyria but possibly for stylistic purposes as he was likely to have been one of the many Babylonian Kings who were contemporary with the later Assyrian King Aššur-rabi II’s lengthy reign.|$|R
