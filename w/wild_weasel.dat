5|$|As {{production}} of F-105s had ended, the type was replaced in the Vietnam War by other aircraft, primarily the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. In October 1970, the 355th Tactical Fighter Wing, based at Takhli RTAFB, Thailand, the last F-105D unit in Southeast Asia, began {{to return to}} the U.S. The F-105G <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> versions soldiered on {{until the end of the}} war. They were gradually replaced by F-4G <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> IVs.|$|E
5|$|USAF Captain Leo K. Thorsness {{was awarded}} the Medal of Honor and Capt Harold Johnson the Air Force Cross for an F-105F <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> mission on 19 April 1967, flying F-105F, serial number 63-8301. Thorsness and Johnson {{protected}} an attempted rescue of another <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> crew that had been shot down, in the process destroying two MiG-17s. After running out of ammunition, Thorsness and Johnson continued to act as decoys to draw the MiGs away from the rescue aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August 1990, 24 F-4G <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> Vs and six RF-4Cs were {{deployed}} to Shaikh Isa AB, Bahrain, for Operation Desert Storm. The F-4G {{was the only}} aircraft in the USAF inventory equipped for the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role, and was needed to protect coalition aircraft from Iraq's extensive air defense system. The RF-4C was the only aircraft equipped with the ultra-long-range KS-127 LOROP (long-range oblique photography) camera, and was used {{for a variety of}} reconnaissance missions. In spite of flying almost daily missions, only one RF-4C was lost in a fatal accident before the start of hostilities. One F-4G was lost when enemy fire damaged the fuel tanks and the aircraft ran out of fuel near a friendly airbase. The last USAF Phantoms, F-4G <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> Vs from 561st Fighter Squadron, were retired on 26 March 1996. The last operational flight of the F-4G <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> was from the 190th Fighter Squadron, Idaho Air National Guard, in April 1996. The last operational USAF/ANG F-4 to land was flown by Maj Mike Webb and Maj Gary Leeder of the Idaho ANG.|$|E
50|$|An Air Force Iron Hand {{mission was}} similar. A {{group of four}} fighter/bombers flew in ahead of the strike package to {{suppress}} SAMs. One or more would be two-seat F-100F or F-105F <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasels</b> with SAM detection and analysis electronics. Initially, the fighter/bombers had to attack SAM sites with gravity bombs. When F-105F <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasels</b> arrived, they brought the Shrike Anti-Radiation missile for limited stand-off capability. Later, F-105G <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasels</b> could also be armed with the Standard ARM.|$|R

5|$|In 1965, the USAF began {{operating}} two-seat North American F-100F Super Sabres specially {{equipped for}} Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses mission in Vietnam. Nicknamed the <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel,</b> these aircraft achieved {{a number of}} victories against North Vietnamese surface-to-air missile radars. The second crew member was a Navigator trained as an Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO) to decipher sensor information and guide the pilot towards the targets. However, the F-100F was an interim solution, since its limited payload often required multiple aircraft to conduct a successful strike; it also lacked the speed and endurance to effectively protect the F-105.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{a number}} of programs, such as the IAI Harpy or the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, {{integrated}} anti-radiation sensors into a drone or missile air frames coupled with command and control and loitering capabilities. This allowed the attacking force to place relatively cheap munitions in place over suspected SAM sites, and to attack promptly the moment the SAM battery is visible. This integrated {{the use of a}} drone as a baiting decoy with the attack role into one small and relatively cheap platform in comparison to the alternative <b>wild</b> <b>weasel</b> jet fighter.|$|E
5|$|The Phantoms {{began to}} be {{returned}} to the USAF in 1972. No.6 Squadron ceased operating the aircraft on 4October 1972. Six F-4Es departed for the United States on 25October that year, followed by a further five in early November. The first six F-111s arrived at Amberley on 1June 1973, and six Phantoms left for the United States five days later. The final RAAF Phantom flight was made on 20June, and four of the aircraft departed the next day. The last two Phantoms left Amberley on 21June. All but two of the former RAAF Phantoms were subsequently converted to specialist <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The Wild Weasels {{also carried}} {{electronic}} countermeasures (ECM) equipment to protect themselves. They directed flak suppression strikes and carried AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missiles (another Navy development), which homed {{in on the}} radar systems of the SAMs. The SA-2 had greater range than the Shrike, but if the Shrike was launched and the radar operator stayed on the air, the American missile would home in on the signal and destroy the radar source. A sophisticated cat and mouse game then ensued between North Vietnamese radar operators and the <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> pilots.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} EF-105F <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> III (the EF designation was popularly used but unofficial) supplemented its {{sensors and}} electronic jamming equipment with AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missiles and conventional bombs, giving it an offensive capability {{lacking in the}} F-100F. The first of these aircraft flew on 15 January 1966 and they began arriving in Southeast Asia in May, flying their first mission on 6 June 1966, with five assigned to the 13th TFS at Korat RTAFB and six more to the 354th TFS at Takhli RTAFB.|$|E
5|$|The F-4 Phantom II {{remained}} in {{use by the}} U.S. in the reconnaissance and <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) roles in the 1991 Gulf War, finally leaving service in 1996. It was also the only aircraft used by both U.S. flight demonstration teams: the USAF Thunderbirds (F-4E) and the US Navy Blue Angels (F-4J). The F-4 was also operated by {{the armed forces of}} 11 other nations. Israeli Phantoms saw extensive combat in several Arab–Israeli conflicts, while Iran used its large fleet of Phantoms acquired before the fall of the Shah in the Iran–Iraq War. Phantoms remain in frontline service with four countries. Phantom production ran from 1958 to 1981, with a total of 5,195 built, making it the most produced American supersonic military aircraft.|$|E
50|$|This {{nickname}} {{refers to}} a mission which {{was carried out by}} a number of different aircraft types over the years. The first at Takhli were F-100 Super Sabres, which like all <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasels</b> had the unique job of baiting surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites to fire at them. Then {{all they had to do}} was evade the missile and lead an attack on the radar facility that guided the SAMs. Sometimes they, or the strike aircraft with them, would fire a radar-seeking AGM-45 Shrike missile which followed the SAM site's radar beam right back down to the transmitting antenna. When these relatively early-technology missiles missed, as often happened, or when the aircraft ran out of missiles, <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasels</b> would attack SAM sites with bombs or their M-61A1 20mm Vulcan cannon.|$|R
50|$|The 23d Tactical Fighter Squadron {{moved to}} Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, and in January 1972 {{became part of}} the 52d Tactical Fighter Wing. The 23d {{converted}} to F-4E and F-4G <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasels</b> in 1982 and began flying defense suppression missions. In July 1987, the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon replaced the F-4E.|$|R
500|$|On 11 August 1967, F-105Ds from 335th Tactical Fighter Squadron {{with support}} from F-105 <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasels</b> from 338th Tactical Fighter Squadron made {{the first of many}} {{successful}} attacks on the Paul Doumer bridge over the Red River. Flying low-altitude missions and conducting dive bombings forced the F-105s into range of North Vietnamese anti-aircraft guns, sometimes coming under heavy fire.|$|R
5|$|The {{response}} to {{the first generation of}} fixed installation surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) such as SA-2 and SA-3 was the development of the anti-radiation missile such as AGM-45 Shrike and other means to attack fixed SAM installations, as well as developing SEAD doctrines. The Soviet counter-response was the use of mobile SAMs such as SA-6 with intermittent use of radar. Thus, the SAM battery was only visible for a small period of time, during which it was also a significant threat to high-value <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> fighters. In 1982 Operation Mole Cricket 19 various means including UAVs and air-launched Samson decoys were used over suspected SAM areas to saturate enemy SAMs and to bait them to activate their radar systems, which were then attacked by anti-radiation missiles.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} the first <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> SEAD (air defense suppression) {{aircraft}} whose specially trained crews were tasked with locating and destroying enemy air defenses. Four F-100F <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> Is were fitted with an APR-25 vector radar homing and warning (RHAW) receiver, IR-133 panoramic receivers with greater detection range, and KA-60 panoramic cameras. The APR-25 could detect early-warning radars and emissions from SA-2 Guideline tracking and guidance systems. These aircraft deployed to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, in November 1965, began flying combat missions with the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing in December. They were joined by three more aircraft in February 1966. All <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> F-100Fs were eventually modified to fire the AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missile.|$|E
25|$|F-15G <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> was a {{proposed}} two-seat version {{to replace the}} F-4G <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> in the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) role. The F-15G was studied in 1986. A proposed modification to F-15Cs for the SEAD role was studied in 1994–95, but F-16Cs were modified to perform this role instead. F-15Es are capable of carrying ARMs such as the AGM-88 HARM and performing the SEAD role.|$|E
50|$|In mid-1968 it {{was decided}} to make the 388th an F-4 wing, and also to equip the 388th with the new F-4E and the F-105s would be {{transferred}} to Takhli and all of the Thuds in the fighter-bomber mission would be consolidated there. The <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasels</b> would remain at Korat along with the F-4s in their specialized mission.|$|R
5000|$|On 11 August 1967, F-105Ds from 335th Tactical Fighter Squadron {{with support}} from F-105 <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasels</b> from 338th Tactical Fighter Squadron made {{the first of many}} {{successful}} attacks on the Paul Doumer bridge over the Red River. Flying low-altitude missions and conducting dive bombings forced the F-105s into range of North Vietnamese anti-aircraft guns, sometimes coming under heavy fire.|$|R
5000|$|On June 2, 1972, General John Vogt, {{commander}} of the 7th Air Force, consulted with Army MACV commander General Frederick C. Weyand. Vogt canceled the entire strike mission set for Hanoi that day. He dedicated all the available resources, over 150 aircraft, to rescuing Locher. The direct task force of 119 aircraft included two HH-53C rescue helicopters, bombers, {{and an array of}} F-4 escorts, EB-66s, A-1Hs, F-105G <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasels,</b> and KC-135 tankers. Vogt said, ...|$|R
25|$|The North Vietnamese began {{launching}} {{surface-to-air missiles}} against U.S. aircraft in 1965. The Air Force {{had little or}} no defense against these missiles and assigned the USAF Tactical Air Warfare Center the critical mission of developing effective surface-to-air missile (SAM) countermeasures to protect aircrews over the skies of Vietnam. In response to this new threat, USAFTAWC originated and fielded the <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> program. Simultaneously, the center was testing radar homing and warning equipment and self-protection electronic countermeasures jamming pods. Four F-100F Super Sabres, modified as <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> I groundfire suppression aircraft, deployed from Eglin to Southeast Asia on 21 November 1965, assigned to the operational control of the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing.|$|E
500|$|During the war, the single-seat F-105D was {{the primary}} {{aircraft}} delivering the heavy bomb loads against the various military targets. Meanwhile, the two-seat F-105F and F-105G <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> variants became the first dedicated Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) platforms, fighting against the Soviet-built S-75 Dvina (NATO reporting name: SA-2 Guideline) surface-to-air missiles. Two <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> pilots were awarded the Medal of Honor for attacking North Vietnamese surface-to-air missile sites, with one shooting down two MiG-17s the same day. The dangerous missions often required them to be the [...] "first in, last out", suppressing enemy air defenses while strike aircraft accomplished their missions and then left the area.|$|E
500|$|From {{the initial}} {{deployment}} of the F-4C to Southeast Asia, USAF Phantoms performed both air superiority and ground attack roles, supporting not only ground troops in South Vietnam but also conducting bombing sorties in Laos and North Vietnam. As the F-105 force underwent severe attrition between 1965 and 1968, the bombing role of the F-4 proportionately increased until after November 1970 (when the last F-105D was withdrawn from combat) it became the primary USAF tactical ordnance delivery system. In October 1972 the first squadron of EF-4C <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> aircraft deployed to Thailand on temporary duty. The [...] "E" [...] prefix was later dropped and the aircraft was simply known as the F-4C <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel.</b>|$|E
50|$|In August 1990, the <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasels</b> {{deployed}} to Sheikh Isa Air Base in Bahrain and during Operation Desert Storm flew over 2,400 sorties logging more than 8,000 combat hours. Inactivated at George AFB after the war, and reactivated at Nellis Air Force Base on 1 February 1993, the 561st soon {{deployed to}} Incirlik Air Base {{in support of}} Operation Provide Comfort and returned to Southwest Asia at Dhahran Air Force Base in Saudi Arabia, supporting Operation Southern Watch and Operation Vigilant Warrior.|$|R
25|$|On 16 April 1961, six Super Sabres were {{deployed}} from Clark Air Base in the Philippines to Don Muang Airfield in Thailand for air defense purposes; the first F-100s to enter combat in Southeast Asia. From that date until their redeployment in 1971, the F-100s were the longest serving U.S. jet fighter-bomber {{to fight in}} the Vietnam War. Serving as MiG combat air patrol escorts for F-105 Thunderchiefs, Misty FACs, and <b>wild</b> <b>weasels</b> over North Vietnam, and then relegated to close air support and ground attacks within South Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|In August 1990, Iraqi {{military}} forces attacked and occupied {{the nation of}} Kuwait, precipitating the Gulf War. As a result the 525 TFS deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, in December 1990. When the squadron arrived at Incirlik it joined American General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons from Spain, General Dynamics F-111 Aardvarks from England, <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasels</b> from Germany, Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers from Texas, and Boeing E-3 Sentry and other electronic combat support aircraft from around the world. These units, deployed to Incirlik Air Base, formed the 7440th Combat Wing (Provisional) - the U.S. Air Force's first composite wing.|$|R
500|$|The rear cockpits {{of several}} two-seat F-105Fs were {{modified}} under project Commando Nail with an R-14A radar and a radar scope that offered high resolution. These aircraft {{were used for}} all-weather and night low-level strikes against especially dangerous targets by a unit from the 13th Tactical Fighter Squadron (1966–1975) dubbed [...] "Ryan's Raiders" [...] starting in April 1967. Some of these aircraft were later converted to the <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> III standard.|$|E
500|$|USAF Captain Merlyn H. Dethlefsen {{was awarded}} the Medal of Honor and Capt Kevin [...] "Mike" [...] Gilroy the Air Force Cross for an F-105F <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> mission on 10 March 1967, flying F-105F, serial number 63-8352. After their {{aircraft}} was damaged by ground fire, Dethlefsen and Gilroy elected {{to stay in the}} skies above the steel works at Thai Nguyen until the SAM site was found and destroyed.|$|E
500|$|To {{survive in}} this ever more lethal air defense zone, the U.S. had to adopt newer, more {{specialized}} tactics. Large-scale strikes, known as force packages in the Air Force and multi-carrier [...] "Alpha strikes" [...] by the Navy, were assigned numerous support aircraft {{to protect the}} fighter-bombers. First into the target areas were specialized Iron Hand flak suppression missions. These consisted of F-105 <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel</b> hunter/killer teams configured with sophisticated electronic equipment to detect and locate the emissions associated with SAM guidance and control radars.|$|E
50|$|The term is {{normally}} applied to ground attack missions, where the strike package for attacking the primary target will include bombers, fighters to defend them from enemy aircraft, <b>wild</b> <b>weasels</b> {{to defend against}} ground-based anti-aircraft weapons, reconnaissance aircraft for pre-raid and post-raid reconnaissance and tanker aircraft to extend the mission radius. AWACS and stand-off jamming aircraft may support the strike package without entering the most dangerous airspace.In some cases all of these roles {{can be carried out}} by a single aircraft with different payloads, but it is more common to use a variety of different aircraft, launched from different locations and times.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} many mammals such as:porcupines, foxes, <b>weasels,</b> <b>wild</b> rabbits, hedgehogs.|$|R
50|$|The {{members of}} the Phoenix Guard were Cobra agents in disguise, but for Cobra Commander's {{elaborate}} ruse to succeed, {{each member of the}} team needed doctored military records and manufactured personal histories. <b>Wild</b> <b>Weasel's</b> fabricated identity was Halo, real name Kenneth P. Leggitt, born in Chicago, Illinois. Halo's specialties were airborne infantry, aeronautical engineering and fixed wing pilot. He received basic training, advanced infantry training and completed Airborne School all at Fort Benning. He also completed the Special Forces Qualification course and the Military Free Fall Parachutist course at Fort Bragg. General Rey considered him extremely introverted, but also someone who enjoyed his job immensely.|$|R
