5|$|At {{the time}} when the poem Lietuva, Tėvyne mūsų was written, Lithuania was part of the Russian Empire. Kudirka, a medical student at the University of Warsaw, was writing as a {{columnist}} for the newspaper Varpas (The Bell). In his Varpas columns, Kudirka urged Lithuanians to take pride in their heritage, discussed the problems the Russian Government was causing the Lithuanian population, and denounced those who wished to work for the Tsarist autocracy. In the course of writing for Varpas, he wrote down his thoughts on what Lithuania <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> it should be, resulting in the fifty-word poem Lietuva, Tėvynė mūsų ("Lithuania, Our Homeland").|$|E

25|$|Philip Sidney {{was central}} to Scott's {{conception}} of what poetry <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> it could achieve, and in the Model he cites Astrophel and Stella, the Arcadia and, of course, An Apology for Poetry. Gavin Alexander writes that The model of poesy {{is in many ways}} a commentary on The defence of poesy, adopting its basic theory, filling in its gaps, interrogating and weighing its sources, glossing and elaborating its difficulties. But it is also a very different sort of work, a much more ambitious and comprehensive exercise inspired by the Defence but not bounded or constrained by it' (p. liii).|$|E

25|$|The {{problems}} against anti-trafficking raids {{are related}} to the problem of the trafficking concept itself, as raids' purpose of fighting sex trafficking may be conflated with fighting prostitution. The Trafficking Victims Protection Re-authorization Act of 2005 (TVPRA) gives state and local law enforcement funding to prosecute customers of commercial sex, therefore some law enforcement agencies make no distinction between prostitution and sex trafficking. One study interviewed women who have experienced law enforcement operations as sex workers and found that during these raids meant to combat human trafficking, none of the women were ever identified as trafficking victims, and only one woman was asked whether she was coerced into sex work. The conflation of trafficking with prostitution, then, does not serve to adequately identify trafficking and help the victims. Raids are also problematic in that the women involved were most likely unclear about who was conducting the raid, what the purpose of the raid <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> the outcomes of the raid would be.|$|E
25|$|The {{legacy of}} Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara (June 14, 1928 – October 9, 1967) is {{constantly}} evolving {{in the collective}} imagination. As a ubiquitous symbol of counterculture worldwide, Guevara {{is one of the}} most recognizable and influential revolutionary figures of the twentieth century. However, during his life, and even more since his death, Che has elicited controversy and wildly divergent opinions as to who he <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> he represented. Mostly revered and occasionally reviled, he is passionately characterized along the entire continuum as everything from a heroic defender of the poor, to a cold-hearted executioner. Admired, sanctified, romanticized and derided, his crystallized status as either a brilliant intellectual or a violent ideologue is usually dependent on where one falls along the left and right of the political spectrum. The debate around his legacy is further complicated by the fact that Guevara exists simultaneously as several different entities, both literal man and global emblem, leading to disputes between what people contend he did and what he now represents.|$|E

25|$|From {{the end of}} the 19th {{century and}} through most of the 20th century, this part of Mexico City {{suffered}} a severe decline. This house was adapted to rent space to lower-class tenants and by end of the 1950s had become tenements, {{in spite of the fact}} that it had been declared a national monument in 1931. In 1960, the Mexico City government acquired the building from the descendents of the Counts of Santiago de Calimaya in 1960. The City decided to convert this building into a museum. It hired architect Pedro Ramirez Vazques to remodel it, converting the old rooms into exhibition halls. In 1964, the Museum of the City of Mexico was inaugurated, focusing on what Mexico City <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> Mexico City hoped to be. However, by 1992, the Museum was in disarray. The museum closed and there were plans to convert it into lodging for guests of the city, but this never came to pass. In 1997, the Museum was reorganized and reopened dedicated to exhibitions about Mexico City's past, present and future, working in cooperation with the Museo Nacional de Antropología, the Museo de Arte Moderno the Museo de Virreinato and the Galería de Historia.|$|E

[...] Additionally, each volume [...] "ends with abrupt suspense". [...] It also creates a strong and emotional link between the two autobiographies.

500|$|The episode sees Kelsey Grammer {{return as}} Sideshow Bob for his fourth appearance. Clips from {{previous}} episodes featuring Bob {{were used to}} remind viewers who he <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> he had done.

One of the prisoners in Bob's campaign advert is a caricature of producer Richard Sakai. The [...] "Les Wynan" [...] joke was pitched by Mike Reiss.

McQuarrie was introduced to the project while directing Cruise in Jack Reacher. [...] While reading the earlier script McQuarrie [...] "understood very clearly what the premise of the story <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> they were looking for in terms of characters". Even if the previous scripts were darker, Cruise stressed the importance of the story's humor to McQuarrie. The actor compared Cage's violent demises to Wile E.

I kept telling myself, 'I'm going to be fine,' even when I wasn't—especially when I didn't even believe it. The song is about carrying on, even though you feel like you can't. It's about feeling OK when everything is not."

500|$|Usher told Sylelist in November 2011 that he {{is working}} on a new genre of music, which he {{depicted}} as [...] "revolutionary pop".

In a later interview, Usher clarified that his latter quote was misinterpreted, in {{that it is not a}} specific type of sound, but rather what he found as inspiration behind where he <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> he was working on [...] "was revolutionary". The album incorporates pop styles, which Usher described as being [...] "relevant" [...] to its time and [...] "what [...] listening to". Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times summed up the production of the album, writing that it [...] "draws on a world of styles permeating pop culture in 2012", by implementing the genres electronic dance, dubstep, pop and hip-hop to create a hybrid pop. AllMusic's Andy Kellman described revolutionary pop as [...] "contemporary pop-oriented R, or european dance-pop, or some combination of the two", and that the album is [...] "weighted more heavily toward dance-pop" [...] compared to his previous efforts.|$|E

Because the money they had with them had been spent on clothes (NEMS was supposed to send them more), they arranged for credit over two nights in a nightclub. Evans: [...] "We took advantage of our credit standing, as money had still not arrived from England. News about Paul's [...] visit to the club the previous night had spread, and the place was jammed. Now Paul, being a generous sort of person, had built up quite a bar bill, when {{the manager of the}} club arrived demanding that we pay immediately.
