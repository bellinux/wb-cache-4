500|$|Following the match, Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier {{claimed he}} had a premonition that goalkeeper Dudek would be {{the hero of the}} final: [...] "I told Jerzy three days ago 'I can feel you will be the hero. You were too unlucky when we played them, today he was man of the match. But {{football}} can be like that. Sometimes you can be at the bottom and then be a hero again. I just had a feeling. I'm a great believer that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right attitude everything else follows. He had a good run after the World Cup but then he made some mistakes and we had to support him. The squad get on very well. There was no finger-pointing after that game. He has saved us before in games and we had to keep faith in him." [...] Houllier also praised Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson: [...] "I wished him the best in the Champions League because he represents the best in English football, he congratulated every Liverpool player after the final whistle and that shows that he is not just a great manager but a great man." ...|$|E

When questioned about the editorial decision to make Batwoman a gay character in an interview with Wizard Entertainment, DC Comics Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Dan DiDio stated [...] "It was from conversations we’ve had for expanding the DC Universe, for looking at levels of diversity. We wanted to have a cast that is much more reflective of today’s society and even today’s fanbase. One of the reasons we made her gay is that, again <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> Batman Family—a series of characters that aren’t super-powered and inhabit the same circle and the same city—you really want to have a point of difference. It was really important to me to make sure every character felt unique." ...|$|E

Well, she still sings a good To Love You More, but she has obviously come to her own with fuller tones, nice, sexy low notes." ...|$|E

Perry explained the use of a candy theme rather than a beach theme for the video, saying, [...] "It's definitely something to watch <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> munchies. ... It's all edible. We named it 'Candyfornia' instead of 'California', so it's a different world," [...] she said.

[...] "I had to drop clues all the way through because as you know in the seventh book <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> revelation scene where everything shifts and you realise...what Snape's motivation was.

[...] Rowling further said in an interview that she wanted Snape to find redemption and forgiveness: [...] "Snape is a complicated man...he was a flawed human being, like all of us.
