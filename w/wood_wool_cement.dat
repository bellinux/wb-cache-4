40|$|Requests {{of energy}} {{reduction}} and efficiency {{has contributed to}} improve environmental aspects in construction. It has also —mainly for the insulat-ing materials used—raised a new issue: the environmental sustainability of building materials and products. Assessment of the environmental impact produced by any human activity is, in general, very complex and nowadays very debated. It involves a local and global scale, the biosphere — in which humans {{are not the only}} protagonists — and all valuation methods must be considered. The build-ing sector in particular consumes a significant amount of resources, both when producing components and in construction. Construction uses large amount of energy for heating, releases as much pollutant emissions and form massive volumes of mixed waste after demolition. The use of wood in construction meets the main objectives for achieving sustainable development. This is possible through ecological forest man-agement combined with the low environmental impact of products made from wood. Wood is the only renewable resource in building materials. It possesses the capacity to be repaired, reused, efficiently recycled and recovered as fuel {{at the end of its}} life cycle. The contribution of this study is to quantitatively calculate and qualita-tively exam the environmental impacts —positive and negative— produced by the use of wood based components in structures. The focus is specifically insulating <b>wood</b> <b>wool</b> <b>cement</b> boards. The environmental sustainability assessment was combined with a technological analysis in order to verify the thermal performance of the insulation boards and the suitability of structural wood harvested from the Alps forests. The environmental assessment was performed through a life cycle analy-sis and developed according to ISO 14040 standard series, with an environmental product declaration oriented approach. The impact analy-sis was done in the specific software SimaPro 7. 3, including the uncertainty analyses. For the classification and characterization two dif-ferent life cycle impact assessment methods were used. The inventory analysis required a detailed data collection, in this case performed on the production process of a <b>wood</b> <b>wool</b> <b>cement</b> board. The results show that short wood chain supply and different energy pro-duction scenarios lead to a better environmental performance. This study allowed a quantification of the benefits of a short supply chain and eco-design by identifying opportunities for improvement of the <b>wood</b> <b>wool</b> <b>cement</b> board production process and the choice of insulating mate-rials to be included in the building design...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work {{various aspects of}} the energetic, thermal and {{acoustic}} properties of porous materials with <b>wood</b> <b>wool</b> mineralized Portland <b>cement</b> have been analyzed, in cooperation with the company Celenit Srl, a manufacturer of panels for building insulation. These products are also recognized interesting and desirable for their environmental sustainability through specific certifications. Remind that sustainability means "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs", as formulated in 1987 by the United Nations Assembly Gro H. Brundtland. It is for these reasons that in periods of strong research in renewable energy and environmental crisis such as the current one is important to ensure the sustainability of materials, elements, components, and building processes. During the Ph. D. school some software for the evaluation of the thermal performance of the products were subjected to analysis and validation. As input data were chosen experimental values obtained in the laboratories of the Department of Industrial Engineering (DII). Sound absorption, sound reduction and impact noise tests were done in laboratory for what concern the acoustic part. These analyses have {{led to the development of}} dynamic databases for data collection and usage. The dynamic databases, processed in Excel, are collecting all the data of the acoustic tests performed in the lab at the University of Padua. In particular they have been processed two separate databases: one collecting data of airborne sound insulation and one collecting data of test acoustic absorption of materials. ...|$|R

40|$|The present article aims to {{characterize}} and, by using impedance models, predict the sound absorption of <b>wood</b> <b>wool</b> <b>cement</b> boards (WWCB). The main {{challenge lies in}} the inhomogeneity of the WWCB; the samples taken from different commercial boards do not only greatly differ in density, but also in wood-to-binder ratio. Different models, able to predict the acoustic impedance of rigid-frame porous materials, have been analysed and their suitability for the WWCB has been evaluated. It is concluded that the Johnson-Champoux-Allard (JCA) model {{was found to be}} most appropriate to fit the normal incidence sound absorption values as measured in the impedance tube. From the five input parameters for this impedance model, the flow resistivity has been measured. The open porosity, tortuosity and viscous and thermal characteristic lengths, have been determined by making use of an inverse calculation method, a curve fitting approach, based on the measured acoustic absorption coefficients in the impedance tube. The tested WWCBs are made of three different strand widths (1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 mm) and of different thicknesses, densities and wood cement ratios. By making use of the found relations between the bulk density and the input parameters, it is concluded {{that it is possible to}} predict the normal incidence sound absorption of the WWCB by only making use of the bulk density and thickness as input parameters...|$|E
