5|$|The sheep {{industry}} in Spain was {{an instance of}} migratory flock management, with large homogenous flocks ranging over the entire country. The management model used in England was quite different but had a similar importance to economy of the country. Up until the early 20th century, owling (the smuggling of sheep or wool out of the country) was a punishable offense, {{and to this day}} the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords sits on a cushion known as the <b>Woolsack.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Committee's {{first and}} second reports were considered, the Lords passed the bill 221 to 81 on 26 October 1999. During the session, Earl of Burford, son of the Duke of St Albans, {{launched}} a protest at the constitutional implications of the bill from the <b>Woolsack,</b> and was ejected from the chamber. Once the Lords settled the differences between their {{version of the bill}} and the Commons version thereof, the Bill received Royal Assent on 11 November 1999 and became an Act of parliament. The Act then came into force the same day.|$|E
5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Fox-North Coalition, Mansfield agreed to act as Speaker of the House of Lords, taking up his post in February 1783. The main item of debate during the Coalition Ministry was the East India Bill, which provoked bitter arguments in both the House of Lords and House of Commons. In an attempt to speed up the process of passing the bill, Mansfield left his position as Speaker to debate directly on 15 December; when this failed to help he returned to the <b>Woolsack</b> the next day. The failure of the bill caused the government to be immediately dismissed, and Mansfield left his position on 23 December 1783.|$|E

They captured another strongpoint, the [...] "Essex Work", when the defenders panicked.

I was over at the Double-Elm when he came rolling back one evening about sundown. And {{up there in the}} wagon, sure enough, was a piano or a organ--we couldn't tell which--all wrapped up in <b>woolsacks,</b> with a wagon-sheet tied over it in case of rain. And out skips Marilla, hollering, 'Oh, oh!' with her eyes shining and her hair a-flying. 'Dad--dad,' she sings out, 'have you brought it--have you brought it?'--and it right there before her eyes, as women will do.|$|R
25|$|At {{the south}} end of the Chamber are the ornate gold Canopy and Throne; {{although}} the Sovereign may theoretically occupy the Throne during any sitting, he or she attends only the State Opening of Parliament. Other members of the Royal Family who attend the State Opening use Chairs of State next to the Throne, and peers' sons are always entitled to sit on the steps of the Throne. In front of the Throne is the <b>Woolsack,</b> an armless red cushion stuffed with wool, representing the historical importance of the wool trade, and used by the officer presiding over the House (the Lord Speaker since 2006, but historically the Lord Chancellor or a deputy). The House's mace, which represents royal authority, is placed on the back of the <b>Woolsack.</b> In front of the <b>Woolsack</b> is the Judges' <b>Woolsack,</b> a larger red cushion that used to be occupied during the State Opening by the Law Lords (who were members of the House of Lords), and prospectively by the Supreme Court Justices and other Judges (whether or not members), to represent the Judicial Branch of Government. The Table of the House, at which the clerks sit, is in front.|$|E
25|$|The House of Lords was {{presided over}} by the Lord Chancellor, who sat on the <b>woolsack,</b> a large seat stuffed with wool {{from each of the}} three lands of England, Ireland and Scotland. In the Commons, {{business}} was {{presided over by}} the Speaker who, {{in the absence of a}} government chosen from and answerable to the Commons, was the dominant political figure in the parliament. Speaker Conolly remains today one of the most widely known figures produced by the Irish parliament.|$|E
25|$|Lord Eldon was {{continued}} in office as chancellor under Pitt; {{but the new}} administration was of short duration, for on 23 January 1806 Pitt died, worn out with the anxieties of office, and his ministry was succeeded by a coalition, under Lord Grenville. The death of Fox, who became foreign secretary {{and leader of the}} House of Commons, soon, however, broke up the Grenville administration; and in the spring of 1807 Lord Eldon once more, under the Duke of Portland's administration, returned to the <b>woolsack,</b> which, from that time, he continued to occupy for about twenty years, swaying the cabinet.|$|E

There wa'n't much of a load--just some <b>woolsacks</b> and {{blankets}} and nails and canned peaches and a few things we was out of. I look for Ranse to roll in to-day sure.

50|$|The {{official}} Redmond family pedigree (registered in the Ulster Office, Dublin Castle 1763) {{alleges that}} Alexander Redmond {{had to defend}} the Hall one or even two more times against soldiers of Oliver Cromwell {{in the autumn of}} 1649 during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. There is a tradition that the defenders used sacks of wool to block up breaches in the walls created by enemy cannon. These <b>woolsacks</b> and a representation of the Hall {{can be seen in the}} coat of arms issued to one of their members in 1763. It is alleged that Alexander Redmond received favourable terms from Cromwell and died in the Hall in 1650 or 1651 after which his surviving family were evicted, allowed only to retain a third of their original estates in County Wexford.|$|R
60|$|From dinners up to <b>woolsacks</b> {{and divine}} mitres, here in England, much may be {{gathered}} by talk; without talk, {{of the human}} sort nothing. Is Society become wholly a bag of wind, then, ballasted by guineas? Are our interests in it as a sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal?--In Army or Navy, when unhappily we have war on hand, there is, almost against our will, some kind of demand for certain of the silent talents. But in peace, that too passes into mere demand of the ostentations, of the pipeclays and the blank cartridges; and,--except that Naval men are occasionally, on long voyages, forced to hold their tongue, and converse with the dumb elements, and illimitable oceans, that moan and rave there without you and within you, {{which is a great}} advantage to the Naval man,--our poor United Services have to make conversational windbags and ostentational paper-lanterns of themselves, or do worse, even as the others.|$|R
25|$|Of the {{contents}} of the building, some have survived in different locations. The ceremonial mace of the House of Commons remained in the family of the last Speaker of the House of Commons, John Foster, MP. The Bank of Ireland bought the Mace at a sale in Christie's in London in 1937. The Chair of the Speaker of the House of Commons is now in the possession of the Royal Dublin Society, while a bench from the Commons is in the Royal Irish Academy. The original two tapestries have remained in the House of Lords. The chandelier of the House of Commons now hangs in the Examination Hall of Trinity College, Dublin. The <b>Woolsack,</b> on which the Lord Chancellor of Ireland sat when chairing sessions of the House of Lords, is now back in location in the chamber on display. Copies of debates of the old Irish Parliament are now kept in Ireland's modern-day parliament house, Leinster House, on nearby Kildare Street, so keeping a direct link between the old bicameral Parliament of the Kingdom of Ireland and the modern-day bicameral parliament, the Oireachtas, of the modern Republic of Ireland.|$|E
500|$|When {{granting}} assent by commission, {{the sovereign}} authorises {{three or more}} (normally five) lords who are Privy Counsellors to declare assent {{in his or her}} name. The Lords Commissioners, as the monarch's representatives are known, wear scarlet parliamentary robes and sit on a bench between the throne and the <b>Woolsack.</b> The Lords Reading Clerk reads the commission aloud; the senior commissioner then states, [...] "My Lords, in obedience to Her Majesty's Commands, and by virtue of the Commission which has been now read, We do declare and notify to you, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in Parliament assembled, that Her Majesty has given Her Royal Assent to the several Acts in the Commission mentioned." ...|$|E
500|$|Beginning life {{as weapons}} {{carried by the}} king's sergeants-at-arms, or bodyguards, maces evolved into {{ceremonial}} objects carried by the king's officers. Today, {{they are used to}} represent the monarch's authority. The House of Commons can only operate when the royal mace– dating from the reign of CharlesII– is present at the table. Two other maces are used by the House of Lords; one is placed on the <b>Woolsack</b> before the house meets and is absent from the chamber when the monarch is there in person. Originally, there were 16 silver-gilt maces, but only 13 survive, 10 of which are on display at the Tower of London. Two of these are carried in the royal procession at State Openings of Parliament and coronations. Each mace is about [...] long and weighs an average of [...]|$|E
50|$|A {{contemporary}} {{illustration of}} the 1523 State Opening shows a remarkable visual similarity between State Openings of the 16th and 21st centuries. In both cases, the monarch sits on a throne before the Cloth of Estate, crowned and wearing a crimson robe of state; the Cap of Maintenance and Sword of State are borne by peers standing before the monarch {{on the left and}} right respectively; the Lord Great Chamberlain stands alongside, bearing his white wand of office. Members of the Royal retinue are arrayed behind the King (top right). In {{the main body of the}} Chamber, the Bishops are seated on benches to the King's right wearing their parliamentary robes, and the Lords Temporal are seated on the other benches (among them the Duke of Norfolk, carrying his baton as Earl Marshal of England). The judges (red-robed and coifed) are on the <b>woolsacks</b> in the centre, and behind them are the clerks (with quills and inkpots). At the bottom of the picture members of the House of Commons can be seen at the Bar to the House, with the Speaker in the centre, wearing his black and gold robe of state.|$|R

2500|$|Much of {{the public}} {{ceremonial}} mirrored that of the British Houses of Parliament. Sessions were formally opened by a Speech from the Throne by the Lord Lieutenant, who [...] "used to sit, surrounded by more splendour than His Majesty on the throne of England". The Sovereign's official representative, when {{he sat on the}} Throne, sat beneath a canopy of crimson velvet. As in the English and British parliaments, the House of Lords was presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who sat on the <b>Woolsack,</b> a large seat stuffed with wool from each of the three kingdoms, England, Ireland and Scotland. Wool was seen as a symbol of economic success and wealth. At the State Opening of Parliament, Members of Parliament were summoned from the nearby House of Commons chamber by White Rod, as opposed to Black Rod in Westminster, both of Gaelic Origin), a royal official who would [...] "command the members on behalf of His Excellency to attend him in the chamber of peers".|$|E
2500|$|As was {{frequently}} noted at the time, and Hazlitt reminds his readers, Lord Eldon delights in investigating the mazes of the law, and will prolong a case {{as necessary to}} decide fairly between participants in a legal matter; and the decision, however protracted the delay, might well be a fair one. But when the matter {{is one in which}} deciding against the continuance of royal or noble privilege would risk disapproval of the king or lord, however long Eldon's delay, the ruling is invariably in favor of established prerogative. In this, Hazlitt notes, Eldon has been consistent, [...] "a thorough-bred Tory ... an out-and-outer". Hazlitt supports his contention by following it with a list of issue after issue in which, by backing royal and aristocratic privilege, Eldon has decided in favor of maintaining abuses of individual rights. The Lord Chancellor does this not out of malice; his persistent failure to sympathise with the suffering of the common man is due to his blindness to it. This in turn is enabled by the persistent underlying support of royal favor, along with other motives: [...] "The King's hand is velvet to the touch—the <b>Woolsack</b> is a seat of honour and profit!" [...] Nor has he any particular understanding of the plight of the common man through [...] "strong feeling [...] principle." [...] And in this (Hazlitt here continues his psychological explanation) he follows a common human tendency: [...] "Where remote and speculative objects do not excite a predominant interest and passion, gross and immediate ones are sure to carry the day, even in ingenuous and well-disposed minds." ...|$|E

I came in late, [...] and did not go immediately {{into the body of}} the house, but stood just [...] behind the <b>Woolsack.</b> Eldon turned round, and, catching my eye, [...] immediately said to a peer (who had come to him for a few minutes on [...] the <b>Woolsack,</b> as is the custom of his friends), 'Damn them! they'll [...] have it now, by God!--the vote that is just come in will give it [...] them.'"] ...|$|E

"The {{noble and}} learned lord on the <b>woolsack,</b> {{in the debate}} which opened the {{business}} of this day, asserted that your Lordships were incompetent to make any alteration in a money bill or a bill of supply, I should be {{glad to see the}} matter fairly and fully discussed, and the subject brought forward and argued upon precedent, as well as all its collateral relations. I should be pleased to see the question fairly committed, were it for no other reason but to hear the sleek, smooth contractors from the other House come to this bar and declare, that they, and they only, could frame a money bill, and they, and they only, could dispose of the property of the peers of Great Britain. Perhaps some arguments more plausible than those I heard this day from the <b>woolsack,</b> to show that the Commons have an uncontrollable, unqualified right to bind your Lordships' property, may be urged by them. At present, I beg leave to differ from the noble and learned lord; for, until the claim, after a solemn discussion of this House, is openly and directly relinquished, I shall continue to be of opinion that your Lordships have a right to after, amend, or reject a money bill." ...|$|E

60|$|At Bobsborough {{he met his}} constituents, {{and made}} them the normal autumn speech. The men of Bobsborough were well pleased {{and gave him a}} vote of confidence. As none but those of his own party {{attended}} the meeting, it was not wonderful that the vote was unanimous. His father, mother, and sister all heard his speech, and there was a strong family feeling that Frank was born to set the Greystocks once more upon their legs. When a man can say what he likes with the certainty that every word will be reported, and can speak to those around him as one manifestly their superior, he always looms large. When the Conservatives should return to their proper place at the head of affairs, there could be no doubt that Frank Greystock would be made Solicitor-General. There were not wanting even ardent admirers who conceived that, with such claims and such talents as his, the ordinary steps in political promotion would not be needed, and that he would become Attorney-General at once. All men began to say all good things to the dean, and to Mrs. Greystock it seemed that the <b>woolsack,</b> or at least the Queen's Bench with a peerage, was hardly an uncertainty. But then,--there must be no marriage with a penniless governess. If he would only marry his cousin one might say that the <b>woolsack</b> was won.|$|E
