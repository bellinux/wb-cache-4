We were the better team in all departments and we know that if <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> right then we will be there or thereabouts." [...] Hysén, the man of the match, said of his centre-back partner Hansen: [...] "It is so easy playing alongside Alan. He tells you where to go and what position to take up." [...] He saw similarities with Liverpool and playing for a national team: [...] "The standards are so amazingly high. I just want to win things with them." ...|$|E
500|$|At San Diego Comic-Con International 2011, head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb {{announced}} the series Mockingbird was in development at ABC Family. The series, which {{was described as}} [...] "Alias meets Felicity", would feature Bobbi Morse as a freshman science major at [...] "a prestigious university in the Silicon Valley... er life changes when she is recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. and is forced to become a student by day and a super spy by night." [...] By March 2012, Mockingbird was still in development, with Loeb saying, [...] "as with anything that you’re doing, particularly when you’re starting up a brand new entity , things take time {{and we want to}} make sure <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> right." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout December 2014, Banks {{released}} {{a series of}} videos in which she broke down tracks from Broke with Expensive Taste and revealed how each song came to be, dubbed the '16 Days of Azealia'. During the breakdown video for [...] "Chasing Time", Banks revealed that the song was conceived after the aforementioned occasion of her handing a completed version of the album in to her labels. In response to their request that Banks created something more current, she produced [...] "Chasing Time". This was further confirmed {{in an interview with}} Pitchfork Medias Jeremy Gordon, in which Banks said [...] "it got to a point where they were like, 'Azealia, <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>it,</b> you’re cool, but we've spent $2 million on this record, can you just give us one ?' So then I did 'Chasing Time', and I was just like, 'You know, this isn't gonna work out.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Mega-City One and {{its high}} rise towers {{were created in}} Cape Town Film Studios. Finding a {{suitable}} set for the expansive Peach Trees atrium proved difficult, and the producers {{did not want to}} build an expensive set. While observing scouting photos of Cape Town, the filmmakers noticed a large three-walled external space that looked like an interior when filmed at night. A key sequence involving Ma-Ma and her gang firing rotary cannons across the atrium in their attempt to kill Judge Dredd required ten days of filming and eight different sets inside and outside the studio which were blended together with visual effects. Visual effects supervisor Jon Thum was unable to accompany a helicopter flight to obtain planned aerial shots of Johannesburg due to last-minute flight permissions; the resulting shots were non-specific and Thum had to pick out ones that could tell the story. Mantle had to develop new rigs to obtain close-up shots. Describing the aesthetic he aimed to achieve, he said: [...] "I hope it will be more painterly. If <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> right, it will be a cross between Blade Runner and Clockwork Orange." [...] Garland was a constant presence on the shoot; Urban turned to Garland for direction instead of Travis.|$|E
500|$|Bullen {{wanted the}} episode {{to be an}} {{ordinary}} episode of Cold Feet that {{just happened to be}} set in Australia. The original script included stereotypical references to Australian culture, such as [...] "prawns on the barbie", but these were cut to avoid turning the episode into a travelogue. Bullen told the Sun Herald, [...] "I really wanted to go beyond 'no worries' and 'she'll be right mate'. We've asked most of the local actors to improvise with their own sayings, to make sure <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> right." [...] In 2003, Bullen recalled this episode's script as the most difficult he had ever written. The collapse of Karen and David's marriage was a controversial issue among the writer and producers; two characters had already divorced and Harries wanted to avoid all three of the main relationships failing. After enjoying the quality of the Australian guest stars, Bullen joked to the Sun Herald that he would write a spin-off series featuring Gary Sweet. Eventually, no spin-off series were created. This episode was produced as the final episode of Cold Feet; Mike Bullen did not believe he could continue writing another series and cast members were eager to take other roles. During production in Australia, Bullen's interest in the series was renewed, and he decided he would like to write a final run of episodes.|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{said this}} episode {{highlighted}} how the show excelts as portraying small town {{life in a}} comedic way without ridiculing small towns. Fowler said the Twilight jokes felt a bit stale, but he praised Aziz Ansari's performances and moments highlighting the supporting characters, like jokes {{at the expense of}} character Jerry Gergich and Ben's developing respect for Pawnee. Zap2it writer Rick Porter said the series, and [...] "Time Capsule" [...] in particular, accurately captures the details and flavors of the local governments and the public in small towns, even if they exaggerate them. Porter praised the pairing of Chris and Andy and said the two conflicting character personalities worked well together. HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall said he did not feel Will Forte's character was well integrated {{with the rest of the}} cast and that he dragged down the first episode of the series. However, Sepinwall said once Forte removed himself from Leslie's office, the episode had a [...] "terrific second half", and that the public hearing in particular displayed the strengths of the show. Joel Keller of TV Squad had the opposite view of Alan Sepinwall and felt Forte's character was the most interesting part of the episode, whereas the second half felt [...] "dragged down" [...] and less funny. Keller wrote, [...] "It just lasted a scene too long; <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>it,</b> the people in Pawnee are loopy." [...] Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said Parks and Recreation is [...] "at its best when its illustrating small-town life in America" [...] and that the public hearing meetings did so brilliantly. Sundermann praised Rob Lowe's performance and said the new additions of the Chris and Ben characters was [...] "exactly what the show needed to push itself to another level of silliness".|$|E

2500|$|In October 2010, it was rumoured that Guillermo del Toro was {{approached}} {{to direct the}} film, which del Toro later denied. In January 2011, Gareth Edwards was announced as the director for the film. In an interview publicizing the DVD release of Monsters, Edwards discussed the new film: [...] "this will definitely {{have a very different}} feel than the 1998 film and our biggest concern is making sure <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> right for the fans because we know their concerns. It must be brilliant in every category because I'm a fan as well." [...] Edwards further stated, [...] "Without addressing anything specific, everyone knows {{how important it is to}} get it right." ...|$|E

The Deputy Headmaster of Everitt's school told the press that cohesion was generally good at the school. Jalal Uddin, a Bengali activist, spoke of his fears that revenge attacks could continue perpetually. Bengalis told family members to stay indoors, and the police increased their presence in order to combat the gangs. A white gang member said that he would not accept support from the British National Party because [...] "the BNP comes down here, gets everyone whipped up and then when the trouble starts <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> and they run away".|$|E

2500|$|The 1st Marine Division, {{then under}} the command of Major General James Mattis, was one of the two major U.S. land forces that participated in the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq as the land component of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force. In December 2002, MajGen Mattis was quoted as saying, [...] "The President, the National Command Authority and the American people need speed. The sooner <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> over with the better. Our overriding principle will be speed, speed, speed." [...] Initially, the division fought through the Rumaila oil fields, feinted an attack towards Basrah then moved north on Iraq Highway 1 to An Nasariyah – a moderate-sized, Shi'ite dominated city with important strategic significance as a major road junction and proximity to nearby Talil Airfield. The division then fought its way to Baghdad and pushed further to secure Tikrit by forming Task Force Tripoli after the fall of Baghdad. The division covered 808 kilometers in 17 days of sustained combat, the deepest penetrating ground operation in Marine Corps history. After the invasion the division settled in to conduct security and stabilization operations in Baghdad, Tikrit, and then in south-central Iraq from May to October 2003. For actions during the war as part of I MEF the division was awarded its 9th Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 December 2004, Strathfield council's mayor, Alfred Tsang {{stepped down}} over {{allegations}} of corruption. Pictures {{had been published}} in The Australian of him accepting a wad of $100 bills from a developer, Michael Saklawi. However, {{it was not clear}} why the money was given to him, though it was alleged that he was talking to Mr Saklawi about the redevelopment of an [...] council-owned carpark. Tsang had previously released a statement that [...] "Councils need to take leadership roles in this area, we simply cannot continue to support unsustainable development, {{for the sake of our}} children, grandchildren and the future environment, we need to make changes now." [...] According to The Australian Tsang was heard to have said that [...] "Basically, <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> for nothing,..... I am making Strathfield a better place ... I am doing it for the area." [...] Strathfield council soon afterwards released a press statement that it [...] "will not and does not" [...] tolerate misconduct. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is currently investigating whether claims developers were given inside information about land rezoning proposals put to Strathfield Council have any substance and the pictures taken by The Australian were handed to them for further investigation.|$|E
