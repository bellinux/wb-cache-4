40|$|Abstract — Non-coherent {{detection}} gives {{straight forward}} receiver construction modeling then coherent detector considering {{the fact that}} it doesn't oblige carrier phase tracking or synchronization. Likewise since non-coherent demodulators/detectors meets expectations uniquely in contrast to coherent it encourages the use of multilevel non-coherent block coding which gives a greater error correcting limit at higher coding efficiency. The detailed analysis on Non-coherent system demonstrates that the coding efficiency can be further enhanced by expanding the base non-coherent distance between the modulation consolations. This outcome the improvement of new modulation strategy derived from MPSK and named as TAPSK (Twisted Amplitude Phase Shift Keying). This result the development of new modulation technique derived from MPSK and named as TAPSK (Twisted Amplitude Phase Shift Keying). The TAPSK which is a modified version of PSK where the amplitude is switched back and forth on successive constellations may provide higher coding efficiency then traditional techniques for similar error correcting capacity <b>when</b> <b>configured</b> properly <b>for</b> specific block size and back and forth amplitude (radius ratio). This paper presents the Impact Analysis and Comparison of Code Block Size and Radius Ratio on TAPSK Modulation for development of efficient digital communication technique under AWGN and Rayleigh Channels. Finally the simulation results are compared with traditional modulation techniques for BER and Modulation Efficiencies which shows that the TAPSK can achieve much better BER performance with a little compromise with coding efficiency...|$|R

This software can simulate all major aspects of {{a spacecraft}} power subsystem. It is parametrically driven to reduce or eliminate the need for a programmer. Added flexibility is provided through user-designed state models and table-driven parameters. MMPAT is designed to be used by a variety of users, such as power subsystem engineers for sizing power subsystem components; mission planners for adjusting mission scenarios using power profiles generated by the model; system engineers for performing system- level trade studies using the results of the model during the early design phases of a spacecraft; and operations personnel for high-fidelity modeling of the essential power aspect of the planning picture...|$|R
