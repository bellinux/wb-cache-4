5|$|Unlike a teacher-student relationship, in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> memorizes and {{repeats the}} {{material}} back in tests, chavrusa-style learning puts each {{student in the}} position of analyzing the text, organizing his thoughts into logical arguments, explaining his reasoning to his partner, hearing out his partner's reasoning, and questioning and sharpening each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights into the meaning of the text.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the Beirut law school's {{curriculum}} before the 5th century. The Scholia Sinaitica and the Scholia to the Basilica provide glimpses of the school's teaching method, comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze juridic texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as Ulpian. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.|$|E

25|$|In Kenya, {{medical school}} is a faculty of a university. Medical {{education}} lasts for 5 years after <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> graduates with an undergraduate (MBChB) degree.

25|$|Another {{chapter in}} the school's history started with the Velvet Revolution and the fall of {{communism}} (1989), in <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> movement played a major role. The faculty gained democratic self-government, an academic senate was established (today the senate has 35 members, of which 23 are faculty employees and 12 are students), and compulsory classes in Marxist ideology were abolished. Based on a decision by the Academic Senate in 1991, the faculty was renamed the Jessenius Faculty of Medicine in honor of Renaissance physician and humanist Jan Jessenius (1566–1621), the chancellor of the Charles University in Prague, whose ancestors had their roots in the district of Martin.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} {{engages in}} the behavior to escape aversive tasks or demands. For example, {{when a child is}} told to take a bath he begins to cry, and his mother tells him he no longer has to take a bath. Another example includes a teacher telling a student to complete a series of math problems, to <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> flips the desk and is sent to the principal's office. Being sent to the principals office reinforced the behavior of flipping the desk because it allowed the child to escape the aversive activity of completing math problems. Common forms of aversive demands/activities include, but are not limited to, difficult tasks, changes in routines, unpredictability, novel tasks, etc.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{graduate}} students usually rotate through the laboratories of several faculty researchers, after <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> commits to joining a particular laboratory {{for the remainder}} of his or her education. The remaining time is spent conducting original research {{under the direction of the}} principal investigator to complete and publish a dissertation. Unlike undergraduate and professional schools, there is no set time period for graduate education. Students graduate once a thesis project of significant scope to justify the writing of their dissertation has been completed, a point that is determined by the student's principal investigator as well as his or her faculty advisory committee. The average time to graduation can vary between institutions, but most programs average around 5–6 years.|$|E

25|$|Except in winter, {{the uniform}} for {{students}} from grades six to twelve {{consists of a}} short-sleeved white shirt with white trousers. For students from grades three to five, the uniform is a short-sleeved white shirt with navy blue half pants. The uniform differs a bit during the winter season. In winter, students wear a navy blue sweater with a necktie, in addition to shirt and pants. For footwear, students wear black Oxford shoes with white socks. In addition, a name tag and college badge are included {{as part of the}} uniform. There is a tiny color badge on the sleeve which indicates the house to <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> is attached to. Sport uniforms include white T-shirts with navy blue half pants and appropriate footwear. Resident students have distinctive uniforms as well.|$|E
25|$|I have had, in {{the last}} four years, the advantage, if it be an advantage, of many strange and varied experiences, from <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> of realities might draw profit and instruction. But nothing was so thrilling as this: to wait and {{struggle}} among these clanging, rending iron boxes, with the repeated explosions of the shells and the artillery, the noise of the projectiles striking the cars, the hiss as they passed in the air, the grunting and puffing of the engine—poor, tortured thing, hammered by at least a dozen shells, any one of which, by penetrating the boiler, might have made an end of all—the expectation of destruction as a matter of course, the realisation of powerlessness, and the alternations of hope and despair—all this for seventy minutes by the clock with only four inches of twisted iron work to make the difference between danger, captivity, and shame on the one hand—safety, freedom, and triumph on the other.|$|E
25|$|The student {{movement}} began to coalesce after the government's assault on Vocational School #5, which {{marked the first}} major infringement on student autonomy. The movement began to gain support from students outside the capital and from other segments of society, which continued to build until that October. Students formed brigadas (brigades), groups of six or more students who distributed leaflets about the issues in the streets, markets, and most often on public buses. These parochial organizations, the smallest units of the CNH, decided the scope and issues <b>which</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> movement would take up. These included both rural and urban concerns. The brigadistas would board buses {{to speak to the}} passengers about the government's corruption and repression, while others distributed leaflets and collected donations. Eventually, the passengers and bus drivers began to sympathize with the students’ demands for democracy and justice, and the students collected increasing amounts of money. But the aggressive militancy among the students began to disillusion some bus drivers about the students’ motives, and they suspected the youths of seeking power for its own sake.|$|E
