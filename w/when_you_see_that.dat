5|$|We {{thought it}} fit to commend these things most fully to your care {{that you may}} {{know that we have}} given to those Christians free and {{unrestricted}} opportunity of religious worship. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> this has been granted to them by us, your Worship will know that we have also conceded to other religions the right of open and free observance of their worship {{for the sake of the}} peace of our times, that each one may have the free opportunity to worship as he pleases; this regulation is made that we may not seem to detract from any dignity or any religion.|$|E
6000|$|The {{silence was}} broken by Mervyn. 'There! I shall go to bed. Phoebe, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> poor child, tell her not {{to be afraid of}} me, for the scrape was of my making, so don't be sharp with her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{fear for}} that, lad," [...] the {{commodore}} {{said with a}} kindly smile. [...] "Give your man breakfast now, so {{that he may be}} in condition to march, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> we are ready to set off, bring him to me. I will see to it that he has a care-taker who won't wink at an escape." ...|$|E
60|$|Tell Piggot, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> him, <b>that</b> {{we shall}} all be much pleased {{if he will}} come at his own {{convenience}} while you are here, and stay a few days with us.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Silence, sir!' {{returned}} his father, 'what {{do you mean}} by talking, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> people <b>that</b> are {{more than two or three}} times your age, sitting still and silent and not dreaming of saying a word?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Until you {{saw that}} love had taken the place of ambition!" [...] Tears had been {{gathering}} in her eyes whilst he was speaking. Now amazement eliminated her emotion. [...] "But <b>when</b> did <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that?</b> When?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And, doctor, {{when you}} see a glass at his mouth, dash it down; thrust it down, though you thrust out the teeth with it. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> Thorne, tell him of his father--tell him what his father might have been but for that; tell him how his father died like a beast, because he could not keep himself from drink." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Stop a moment; be careful, my lord,' {{put in the}} horse, 'and be {{sure you}} do what I tell you. Dig your spurs in my body up to the rowel, draw your sword, and keep {{yourself}} ready, for we shall have to leap over both bridge and dragon. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> we are right above the dragon cut off his biggest head, wipe the blood off the sword, {{and put it back}} clean in the sheath before we touch earth again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, surely, it was obvious. I {{was then}} much {{surprised}} and interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots {{which she was}} wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, {{and the other a}} plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and fifth. Now, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} {{something}} to do before night, I think. Tell your father, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> him, <b>that</b> I will not trouble him here much longer. But tell him, also, that I have no thanks to give him for his hospitality." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps so; but no lighter heart shall; and, {{to prevent}} it being made heavier by your remonstrances, I will bid you adieu, Mr. Ratcliffe, till dinner-time, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>see</b> <b>that</b> my apprehensions have not spoiled my appetite." ...|$|R
60|$|Oh, look, they've put her face, all by itself, on the screen. My! what a big face she's got <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> it like <b>that.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{have done}} well," [...] the man said. [...] "They {{have made a}} beginning. My name, monsieur, is Cathelineau; my business, so far, has been that of a hawker. I am well known {{in this part of}} the country. Maybe, sir, you will hear my name again, for {{henceforth}} I am an insurgent. We have borne this tyranny of the butchers in Paris too long, and the time has come when we must either free ourselves of it, or die. You belong to another class, but methinks that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> we are in earnest, you will join." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you," [...] he said, [...] "with the dog, follow hard {{upon the}} traces of Bruce. When you reach the top signal to us the {{direction}} in which he has gone. Follow ever on his track without stopping; he must at last take to the low country again. Some of my men shall remain here, others a mile further on, and so on round the whole foot of the hills. Do you, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that,</b> thinking he has distanced you, which he may well do being more lightly armed and flying for his life, he makes for the low country again, send men in different directions to give me warning. The baying of the dog will act as a signal to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|If {{you marry}} me you will be much happier with me than with your brother. But you must first go into the sitting-room and look in the cupboard. There you will find three bottles. In one of them there is a healing {{ointment}} which you must put on my chin to heal the wound; then if I drink {{the contents of the}} second bottle it will make me well, and the third bottle will make me stronger than I ever was before. Then, when your brother comes back from the wood with his beasts you must go to him and say, [...] "Brother, you are very strong. If I were to fasten your thumbs behind your back with a stout silk cord, could you wrench yourself free?" [...] And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> he cannot do it, call me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now watch, Charley, sharp," [...] said Rollo; [...] "and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> {{the street}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{think is the}} one where we came into the Corso, tell me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancied you {{understood}} my opinions, and I haven't changed them," [...] said Geoffrey. [...] "I {{asked you}} to meet me here to-day to consider whether the ore already in sight would be worth reduction, and you say, 'No.' You can advise your friends, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> them, <b>that</b> I'm not inclined {{to assist them in}} a deliberate fraud upon the public." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Malcolm {{would not}} mind a straw whether they kept a watch on him or not," [...] Ronald said. [...] "Will <b>you</b> tell him, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> him next, <b>that</b> I got his message?" ...|$|R
60|$|Has {{there ever}} been a child like Eva? Yes, there have been; but their names are always on grave-stones, and their sweet smiles, their heavenly eyes, their {{singular}} words and ways, are among the buried treasures of yearning hearts. In how many families do you hear the legend that all the goodness and graces of the living are nothing to the peculiar charms of one who is not. It is as if heaven had an especial band of angels, whose office it was to sojourn for a season here, and endear to them the wayward human heart, that they might bear it upward with them in their homeward flight. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> deep, spiritual light in the eye,--when the little soul reveals itself in words sweeter and wiser than the ordinary words of children,--hope not to retain that child; for the seal of heaven is on it, and the light of immortality looks out from its eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'See, I {{will lay}} myself {{down in this}} coffin, and will then tell you why I laughed, for as soon as I have told you I shall surely die.' So he lay down in the coffin, and while he took a last look around him, his old dog came out from the farm and sat down by him, and whined. When the master saw this, he called to his wife: 'Bring {{a piece of bread}} to give to the dog.' The wife brought some bread and threw it to the dog, but he would not look at it. Then the farm cock came and pecked at the bread; but the dog said to it: 'Wretched glutton, you can eat like that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> your master is dying?' The cock answered: 'Let him die, if he is so stupid. I have a hundred wives, which I call {{together}} when I find a grain of corn, and as soon as they are there I swallow it myself; should one of them dare to be angry, I would give her a lesson with my beak. He has only one wife, and he cannot keep her in order.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will be excellent," [...] Beric agreed, [...] "and {{you would}} doubtless {{be able to}} make a long defence against them on the causeway. But you must not depend upon their keeping upon that. They will wade through the swamp waist deep, and, if it be deeper still, will cut down bushes and make faggots and move forward on these. So, though you may check them on the causeway, they will certainly, by one means or other, make their way up to your intrenchment, and you must {{therefore}} strengthen this in every way. I should build up a great bank behind it, so that if they break through or fire the defences you can defend the bank. There is one thing that must be done without delay; we must build more boats. There must be here many men from the eastern coast, where they have much larger and stronger craft than these coracles. I should put a strong party to work upon them. Then, in case of an attack, you could, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> longer resistance would be vain, take to the boats and join me; or, when the Romans approach, send them off to fetch my party from the island. Besides, we shall want to move bodies of men rapidly so as to attack and harass the enemy when they are not expecting us.|$|E
6000|$|... "This, alas, was no gamble!" [...] he said. [...] "He was betting upon certainties, but he won. Will {{you tell}} him from me, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> him, <b>that</b> {{although}} I have not the money in my pocket at the moment, I shall pay my debts. Tell him that we are as careful {{to do that in}} France as we are to keep our word!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not cowardly, Wilson, for I {{know you}} would willingly stay if you could be of the {{slightest}} use; but, as, on the contrary, you would only add to the danger, it must be as I have arranged. Goodby, lad; don't stay; {{it has to be}} done. God bless you! Goodby, Murad. Tell your father <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> him <b>that</b> I know no shadow of broken faith rests on him." ...|$|R
50|$|How {{to get to}} Ulimang is to {{go north}} on the compact road and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> a sign <b>that</b> says Ngebuked, go down that road and turn right.Keep on driving {{straight}} along the road until <b>you</b> <b>see</b> a sign <b>that</b> says Ngaraard Evangelical Church. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> it, <b>you</b> are in Ulimang.|$|R
60|$|Is it true, thought Pendennis, {{lying on}} his bed and gazing at a bright moon without, that lighted up a corner of his dressing-table, and the frame of a little sketch of Fairoaks drawn by Laura, and hung over his drawers--is it true that I am going to earn my bread at last, and with my pen? that I shall {{impoverish}} the dear mother no longer; and that I may gain a name and reputation in the world, perhaps? These are welcome if they come, thought the young visionary, laughing and blushing to himself, though alone and in the night, as he thought how dearly he would relish honour and fame {{if they could be}} his. If fortune favours me, I laud her; if she frowns, I resign her. I pray Heaven I may be honest if I fail, or if I succeed. I pray Heaven I may tell the truth as far as I know it: that I mayn't swerve from it through flattery, or interest, or personal enmity, or party prejudice. Dearest old mother, what a pride will you have, if I can do anything worthy of our name I and you, Laura, you won't scorn me as the worthless idler and spendthrift, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> I--when I have achieved a--psha! what an Alnaschar I am because I have made five pounds by my poems, and am engaged to write half a dozen articles for a newspaper. He went on with these musings, more happy and hopeful, and in a humbler frame of mind, than he had felt to be for many a day. He thought over the errors and idleness, the passions, extravagances, disappointments, of his wayward youth: he got up from the bed: threw open the window, and looked out into the night: and then, by some impulse, which we hope was a good one, he went up and kissed the picture of Fairoaks, and flinging himself down on his knees by the bed, remained for some time in that posture of hope and submission. When he rose, it was with streaming eyes. He had found himself repeating, mechanically, some little words which he had been accustomed to repeat as a child at his mother's side, after the saying of which she would softly take him to his bed and close the curtains round him, hushing him with a benediction.|$|E
5000|$|Situation Awareness Theory [...] {{holds that}} visual {{information}} helps pairs assess {{the current state}} of the task and plan future actions. [...] An example would be when a friend is solving a problem that you know the solution to, you could intervene and provide hints or instructions <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> your friend is stuck and needs help. Similarly, the grounding theory maintains that visual information can support the conversations through evidence of common ground or mutual understanding. Using the same example, you could provide clearer instruction to the problem <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> your friend is stuck. Therefore, an extension to both theories would mean that when groups have timely visual information, they would be able to monitor the situation and clarify instructions more efficiently.|$|E
5000|$|Campbell {{remarked that}} the core message of the opera is [...] "'War is not {{sustainable}} {{when you come to}} know your enemy as a person.' <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the person you might be shooting has a child or a wife or has this life at home and they’re just not the enemy, then it becomes very difficult if not impossible to sustain war." ...|$|E
6000|$|Festing laughed. [...] "I don't {{know that}} I've {{thought much about}} these matters, but I am an individualist. You get up against useless rules, empty formalities, and much general stupidity in {{organized}} effort, and good work is often wasted. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> things <b>that</b> demand to be done, you want to begin right there and get at the job. If <b>you</b> wait to <b>see</b> if it's yours or somebody else's, you're apt not to start at all." ...|$|R
50|$|Some legends have it <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> someone <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{may never}} meet again, these flowers, also called red spider lilies or corpse flowers, would bloom along the path. Perhaps {{because of these}} sorrowful legends, Japanese people often used these flowers in funerals. The popular Japanese name Higanbana (Higan bana) for Lycoris radiata {{literally}} means higan (the other or that shore of Sanzu River) flower, decorate and enjoyable, flower of afterlife in gokuraku jyōdo (gokuraku jyōdo).|$|R
6000|$|Ethel {{rested her}} head on her shoulder. [...] "Aunt Flora! Aunt Flora! If any words could tell what Margaret has been ever since we were left. Oh, don't make me talk or think of {{ourselves}} without her. It is wrong to wish. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> her, <b>that</b> dear face of hers will make you happy in the present. Then," [...] added Ethel, not able to leave off with such a subject, [...] "you have our Norman to see." ...|$|R
50|$|For {{end-users}} {{the use of}} MPLS is {{not visible}} directly, but can be assumed when doing a traceroute: only nodes that do full ip routing are shown as hops in the path, thus not the MPLS nodes used in between, therefore <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> a packet hops between two very distant nodes and hardly any other 'hop' is seen in that providers network (or AS) {{it is very likely}} that network uses MPLS.|$|E

5000|$|In April 2007, Featherstone was {{required}} to return large quantities of parliamentary stationery after her House of Commons office ordered £22,000 worth in the previous month {{in an attempt to}} beat new rules on stationery allowances. Featherstone blamed a staff member for the incident, declaring that she [...] "knew nothing". In a leaked email, parliamentary official Cliff Harris reportedly stated [...] "it's quite alarming <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Lynne Featherstone spent over £22,000 in one month, the equivalent to three years' of the new-capped rate". Featherstone subsequently said she would be putting in place [...] "better office procedures".|$|E
6000|$|The {{next time}} I saw my partner, I said, 'Now, come out, be honest, {{and tell me}} the truth. Where did <b>you</b> go <b>when</b> <b>you</b> went to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> battle?' He says, 'I {{went down in the}} hold.' ...|$|R
