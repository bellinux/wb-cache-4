50|$|There {{are three}} basic {{technology}} requirements for a wrapped cable system - a {{fibre optic cable}} with suitable performance for installation on an overhead power-line; a device for carrying out the wrapping operation (<b>wrapping</b> <b>equipment)</b> and the appropriate hardware to stabilise and complete the installation.|$|E

50|$|Key to the {{eventual}} {{success of the}} machine was the hiring of Jay Miner, a chip designer who managed to squeeze an entire wire <b>wrap</b> of <b>equipment</b> making up the TIA into a single chip. Once that was completed and debugged, the system was ready for shipping.|$|R

They arrived on December 14 the day after the citys fall, spent New Years there, and continued shooting until January 4.|$|R
50|$|Despite being founded only {{relatively}} recently, the club's history stretches {{back over}} a combined 200-year period. Lincoln Roses Hockey Club began {{life as a}} part of the Sports Club of Rose Brothers (Gainsborough) Limited, a manufacturer of sweet <b>wrapping</b> <b>equipment.</b> Gainsborough Rose Hockey Club, as they were known at the time following an amalgamation with Gainsborough Ladies Hockey Club, started to take on organised hockey with the formation of the Lincolnshire Hockey League. Later, with the advent of artificial turf becoming the de facto playing surface in the sport, facilities were sought in Lincoln and in time a formal link with Lincoln University saw the club renamed Lincoln Roses Hockey Club.|$|E
50|$|A novel {{wrapping}} {{technology was}} developed by Russian company Teralink during the early 2000s. The wrapping machine is self-balancing with the fibre-optic cable payload held {{on a pair of}} drums arranged one {{on either side of the}} host conductor and therefore on either side of the axis of the machine. The cable pays off one drum for 100-150m then the other drum and so on, alternately switching between drums. The drums are never more than 2 kg out of balance and the machine does not require an external counterbalance system. This keeps the machine smaller than other designs of <b>wrapping</b> <b>equipment</b> and the payload constitutes a higher proportion of the all-up weight. Two constructors are able to place by hand the machine with full drum of cable on the wire.|$|E
40|$|An {{independent}} {{chemical compatibility}} review of various wrapping and absorbent/padding materials {{was conducted to}} evaluate resistance to chemicals and constituents present in liquid waste from the Hanford underground tanks. These materials {{will be used to}} <b>wrap</b> long-length contaminated <b>equipment</b> when such equipment is removed from the tanks and prepared for transportation and subsequent disposal or storage. The materials studied were Cooley L 18 KU, Herculite, and Elephant Mat. The study concludes that these materials are appropriate for use in this application...|$|R
50|$|Tether locks are {{can only}} be {{securely}} fastened if the equipment has some sort of closed loop (for example on the bindings of snowboards). The tether at one end must <b>wrap</b> around the <b>equipment</b> and the lock at the other must then thread through the tether. The lock can then be used to clip on to any fixed object. They are usually fastened with a code or with a key once again requiring that the user remove their gloves to operate.|$|R
5000|$|According to Burt Bluestein of the Directors Guild of America, [...] "It {{all began}} when Abby was a 1st AD and {{people on the}} crew would ask him how many shots were left to do before lunch. Abby would answer, 'We'll do this and one more.' At {{the end of the}} day, when they asked what was to be done before the wrap, Abby would say, 'This and one more, then we're out of here.'" [...] Abby Singer himself {{explains}} the reason behind calling out the second to last shot; [...] "In television, we would make maybe five or six moves during the day â€” going from one set to another, or from one stage to another. Or we'd move from the back lot to a stage. I would say, 'Fellas, we'll do this shot and one more and then we're moving.' This would give the crew a chance to begin <b>wrapping</b> up their <b>equipment</b> or to call transportation for gurneys, so they'd be ready to get out quickly... I did it really to save time for the director. If we did it during the day, I could save 10 to 15 minutes each time we had to move. I could give the director another hour a day of shooting." ...|$|R
