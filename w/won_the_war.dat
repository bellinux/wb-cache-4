5|$|Approximately 27,000 Boer {{women and}} {{children}} died in British concentration camps, resulting in a long-lasting legacy of bitterness towards the British and claims of genocide of Afrikaners. The British <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> but anti-British sentiment contributed {{to the rise of}} Afrikaner nationalism and the pro-Afrikaner National Party was the ruling party of South Africa from 1948 until 1994, the apartheid era.|$|E
5|$|In 1878, the Bannock {{people and}} {{northern}} Shoshone tribes {{participated in the}} Bannock War, a war against white settlers in the region over the destruction of camas root — {{a major source of}} food for the natives — by white settlers' hogs. The Bannock and the Northern Paiute suffered from violence during the conflict, and once the white settlers had <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> the natives were allotted into various reservations. The Northern Paiute were sent to the Yakama Indian Reservation, and in later years have been dispersed throughout several reservations in the western United States.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{travelled}} {{thousands of}} miles to arrive in India. They studied Indian geography and mastered local languages {{to deal with the}} Indians. At the time, they were technologically advanced, with superior equipment in several critical areas to that available locally. Chhabra hypothesizes that even if the British technical superiority were discounted, they would have <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> because of the discipline and organization in their ranks. After the First Anglo-Maratha war, Warren Hastings declared in 1783 that the peace established with the Marathas was on such a firm ground that it {{was not going to be}} shaken for years to come.|$|E

5|$|The current Romanian Land Forces {{were formed}} in 1859, {{immediately}} after the unification of Wallachia with Moldavia, and were commanded by Alexandru Ioan Cuza, Domnitor of Romania until his abdication in 1866. In 1877, {{at the request of}} Nikolai Konstantinovich, Grand Duke of Russia the Romanian army fused with the Russian forces, and led by King Carol I, fought in what was to become the Romanian War of Independence. They participated in the Siege of Plevna and several other battles. The Romanians <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> but suffered about 27,000 casualties. Until World War I, the Romanian army didn't face any other serious actions.|$|E
5|$|Another {{much earlier}} Puranic {{character}} associated with Kerala is Mahabali, an Asura and a prototypical just king, who ruled the earth from Kerala. He <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> against the Devas, driving them into exile. The Devas pleaded before Lord Vishnu, {{who took his}} fifth incarnation as Vamana and pushed Mahabali down to Patala (the netherworld) to placate the Devas. There is a belief that, once a year during the Onam festival, Mahabali returns to Kerala. The Matsya Purana, among {{the oldest of the}} 18 Puranas, uses the Malaya Mountains of Kerala (and Tamil Nadu) as the setting for the story of Matsya, the first incarnation of Vishnu, and Manu, the first man and the king of the region.|$|E
5|$|John's French defeats {{weakened}} {{his position}} in England. The rebellion of his English vassals resulted in the Magna Carta, which limited royal power and established common law. This would {{form the basis of}} every constitutional battle of the 13th and 14th centuries. The barons and the crown failed to abide by the Magna Carta, leading to the First Barons' War when rebel barons provoked an invasion by Prince Louis. Many historians use John's death and William Marshall's appointment as protector of nine-year-old Henry III to mark the end of the Angevin period {{and the beginning of the}} Plantagenet dynasty. Marshall <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> with victories at Lincoln and Dover in 1217, leading to the Treaty of Lambeth in which Louis renounced his claims. In victory, the Marshal Protectorate reissued the Magna Carta as the basis of future government.|$|E

5|$|On 16 August, {{the ships}} were {{formally}} {{integrated into the}} Ottoman Navy while their crews were given new uniforms and formally reenlisted. The British had thought this action was meant to counterbalance their seizure of the Ottoman battleships, {{but this was not}} strictly the case. The Ottomans feared the Entente, particularly Russia, would attempt to partition the empire if they <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> whereas Germany and Austria-Hungary would not. Once the British became aware of this, they feared that the Ottomans were more likely to enter the conflict in Germany's favour. Following Russia's failures in its operations against Germany in late August, Russian incursion in Ottoman territory seemed unlikely. Meanwhile, the Ottoman officials reached neutrality agreements with the governments of Greece and Romania while Bulgaria displayed pro-German tenancies, alleviating their fears of a Balkan threat. Enver then began to move his defensive policy towards an aggressive one.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 18thcentury {{and into}} the early 19thcentury, the Northern Paiute had {{numerous}} conflicts with tribes who lived to the northwest. The Wasco-Wishram and other Chinook tribes often encroached on the high desert landscape of the Northern Paiute territory. After one such incident in 1811, the Northern Paiute migrated north to the Columbia River and attacked Wasco canoes. Around this time, the Northern Paiute numbered approximately 7,500. The Snake War, a war between the natives and white settlers in {{the region in the}} 1860s, killed roughly two thirds {{of the population of the}} Northern Paiute. The whites <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> and then set aside the Malheur Reservation for the Northern Paiute and other Oregon Native American tribes.|$|E

When the North finally <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in 1975, Lê Duẩn and his associates were overly optimistic about the future. The Second Five-Year Plan (1976–1980) was a failure and left the Vietnamese economy in crisis. Vietnam was then headed by a gerontocracy (in which the rulers are much older than the average adult). Vietnam became internationally isolated during Lê Duẩn's rule. In 1979 the country had invaded Kampuchea and ousted Pol Pot, fought a war with China and became dependent on Soviet economic aid. Lê Duẩn died in July 1986 and was succeeded by Trường Chinh.|$|E
5|$|Upon the Beatles' {{return to}} England, rumours began to {{circulate}} {{that they had}} decided to break up. Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band, but was persuaded to stay on the assurance {{that there would be no}} more tours. The group took a three-month break, during which they focused on individual interests. Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to study the sitar under the instruction of Ravi Shankar and develop his interest in Hindu philosophy. Having been the last of the Beatles to concede that their live performances had become futile, Paul McCartney collaborated with Beatles producer George Martin on the soundtrack for the film The Family Way. Lennon acted in the film How I <b>Won</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> and attended art showings, such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono. Ringo Starr used the break to spend time with his wife Maureen and son Zak.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{fourteen}} years after Blazkowicz's admission, the Nazis {{order that the}} asylum is to be shut down, killing all the patients and executing Anya's family when they resist. Blazkowicz awakens from his vegetative state as {{he is about to}} be executed, killing the extermination squad and escaping the asylum with Anya. Blazkowicz and Anya drive to her grandparents' farm, where they inform him that the Nazis <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> by forcing the United States to surrender in 1948, and that the members of the ensuing Resistance were captured. Blazkowicz interrogates a captured officer from the asylum (he was hidden in the trunk of a car), learning that the top members of the Resistance are imprisoned in Berlin before brutally executing him with a chainsaw. Anya's grandparents smuggle her and Blazkowicz through a checkpoint in Stettin before they travel to Berlin. During the train ride, Blazkowicz and Anya enter into a romantic relationship. When they arrive, Anya helps Blazkowicz break into the prison, where he rescues the person he spared {{fourteen years}} prior (Fergus or Wyatt) and finds that the Resistance movement is a revived Kreisau Circle led by Caroline Becker (Bonita Friedericy), who was left paralyzed due to her injuries at Isenstadt.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the episode}} was filmed on the Daedalus set. Due to that, visual effects were {{required}} {{to fill in the}} external shots. The episode was reportedly {{one of the most expensive}} VFX budgets in the series, and is the most expensive for the season. The star map behind the captain's chair of the Daedalus is usually lit green. However, the episode's writer and supervising producer, Alan McCullough, deliberately turned the map 90 degrees and changed the color from green to orange, so as to make the ship different from the normal Daedalus. McCullough also stated that the episode is a one-off, but did not rule out a return beyond the fifth season. He also said that he originally planned the team to visit a reality where the Ancients <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> against the Wraith, but this idea was dropped as it would detract from the main storyline. The episode was Jason Momoa's first appearance with his customised wig. After he had his hair cut by the time the fourth season was completed, for the first three episodes he had it sewn back on. However, when SCI FI wouldn't allow his hairstyle to be changed, they switched to the wig after Momoa complained about the pain of having his hair sewn on again.|$|E
5|$|When Allen {{and his men}} landed above St. John and scouted the situation, {{they learned}} that a column of 200 or more regulars was approaching. Rather than attempt an ambush on those troops, which {{significantly}} outnumbered his tired company, Allen withdrew {{to the other side}} of the river, where the men collapsed with exhaustion and slept without sentries through the night. They were awakened when British sentries discovered them and began firing grapeshot at them from across the river. The Boys, in a panic, piled into their bateaux and rowed with all speed upriver. When the expedition returned to Ticonderoga two days later, some of the men were greatly disappointed that they had nothing to show for the effort and risks they took. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Crown Point proved to be crucial in the Revolutionary War because it secured protection from the British to the North and provided vital cannon for the colonial army; some even speculate that if the attempts to capture the two forts had been unsuccessful, the colonists might not have <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Kaga ikki, {{also known}} as The Peasants' Kingdom, was a theocratic feudal confederacy that emerged in Kaga Province (present-day {{southern}} Ishikawa Prefecture), Japan, during the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The Kaga ikki was a faction of the Ikkō-ikki, mobs of peasant farmers, monks, priests, and ji-samurai (lesser nobles) that espoused belief in Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism. Though nominally {{under the authority of}} the Hongan-ji head abbot, the Monshu, the Ikkō-ikki proved difficult to control. During the Ōnin War, the ikki in Kaga, with the approval of the Monshu Rennyo, helped restore Togashi Masachika to the position of shugo (military governor). However, by 1474 the ikki fell into conflict with Masachika, and in late 1487, they launched the Kaga Rebellion. Masachika was overthrown, and Togashi Yasutaka, his uncle, took his place as shugo. Under Yasatuka's son, Taneyasu, the Kaga ikki asserted more and more influence over the provincial government. In 1531 a civil war erupted as two factions within the Kaga ikki vied for control. Renjun, a son of Rennyo, <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> abolished the position of shugo, exiled Taneyasu, and established a much tighter Hongan-ji hegemony over the province. In 1546, the Kanazawa Midō was established as a governing body in Oyama Gobo, which would eventually grow into the present-day city of Kanazawa. The Midō oversaw very loosely organized committees of select warlords and priests, who in turn ruled over the local lords and village leaders. The Kaga ikki controlled Kaga until they were overrun by the forces of Oda Nobunaga in a series of campaigns lasting from 1573 to 1582.|$|E
