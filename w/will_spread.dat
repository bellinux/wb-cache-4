5|$|The formula also {{predicts that}} when the contact angle is 0°, the liquid <b>will</b> <b>spread</b> out into a micro-thin layer over the surface. Such a surface {{is said to be}} fully {{wettable}} by the liquid.|$|E
5|$|A {{contact angle}} less than 90° (low contact angle) usually {{indicates}} that wetting {{of the surface}} is very favorable, and the fluid <b>will</b> <b>spread</b> over a large area of the surface. Contact angles greater than 90° (high contact angle) generally means that wetting of the surface is unfavorable, so the fluid will minimize contact with the surface and form a compact liquid droplet.|$|E

5|$|Pouring mercury onto a {{horizontal}} flat sheet of glass {{results in a}} puddle that has a perceptible thickness. The puddle <b>will</b> <b>spread</b> out only {{to the point where}} it is a little under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again this is due to the action of mercury's strong surface tension. The liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible, but the surface tension, at the same time, is acting to reduce the total surface area. The result of the compromise is a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.|$|E
5|$|Throughout a {{great and}} open area, not only {{will there be a}} greater chance of {{favourable}} variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that <b>will</b> <b>spread</b> most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more important role in the changing history of the organic world.|$|E
5|$|After Spike recovers {{and has a}} final {{talk with}} Rashid, he and Elektra are {{captured}} by Cherious Medical, who want to suppress all knowledge of the nanomachines' existence. The two escape from Cherious Medical, grabbing the newly produced vaccine on the way. In turn, Faye escapes after Vincent goes to trigger {{an attack on the}} city that will eventually kill everyone on Mars. After the group reunites, it is determined that Vincent <b>will</b> <b>spread</b> the nanomachines by exploding the giant jack-o'-lantern balloons used in the Halloween parade: Jet has a troop of old aircraft spread the antibodies over the city while Faye heads for the weather control center and causes it to rain on the city, aiding the spread of the vaccine. Spike and Elektra separately head to confront Vincent. Spike arrives first and the two battle to a standstill, then the nanomachines are released and Spike is temporarily weakened by them. As Vincent prepares to kill him, Elektra arrives and shoots Vincent. Having wanted to die since Titan, Vincent does not defend himself and thanks Elektra for their time together before dying.|$|E

5|$|Many {{factors are}} thought to be {{responsible}} for the dramatic decline of this species in Australia, including habitat fragmentation, erosion and sedimentation of soil, insecticides and fertilisers contaminating water systems, the introduction of predatory fish, and alteration of drainage regimes. Population declines are closely related to the introduction of the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), a species native to North America that was introduced to control mosquito larvae. Laboratory studies have demonstrated the eggs and tadpoles of the green and golden bell frog are extremely susceptible to predation by this fish, and in 77 of the 93 sites in New South Wales where the green and golden bell frog was known to have disappeared before 1990, eastern mosquitofish were found to be present. The frogs have been known to inhabit waters containing the fish, but breeding is rarely successful there, pointing to the fish's voracious eating of eggs and tadpoles. The fish are not yet present in eastern Victoria, where green and golden bell frog numbers have remained solid, but the fish likely <b>will</b> <b>spread</b> to rivers there, possibly inflicting heavy losses on the frogs.|$|E

25|$|The Rayleigh {{criterion}} {{dictates that}} any radio wave, microwave or laser beam <b>will</b> <b>spread</b> and become weaker and diffuse over distance; {{the larger the}} transmitter antenna or laser aperture compared to the wavelength of radiation, the tighter the beam and the less it <b>will</b> <b>spread</b> {{as a function of}} distance (and vice versa). Smaller antennae also suffer from excessive losses due to side lobes. However, the concept of laser aperture considerably differs from an antenna. Typically, a laser aperture much larger than the wavelength induces multi-moded radiation and mostly collimators are used before emitted radiation couples into a fiber or into space.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{stage of}} melanoma starts when melanocytes begin out-of-control growth. Melanocytes are {{found between the}} outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) and the next layer (the dermis). This early stage of the disease is called the radial growth phase, when the tumor is less than 1mm thick. Because the cancer cells have not yet reached the blood vessels deeper in the skin, it is very unlikely that this early-stage melanoma <b>will</b> <b>spread</b> {{to other parts of}} the body. If the melanoma is detected at this stage, then it can usually be completely removed with surgery.|$|E

25|$|The chloroplasts {{of plant}} and algal cells can orient {{themselves}} to best suit the available light. In low-light conditions, they <b>will</b> <b>spread</b> out in a sheet—maximizing the surface area to absorb light. Under intense light, they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cell's cell wall or turning sideways so that light strikes them edge-on. This reduces exposure and protects them from photooxidative damage. This ability to distribute chloroplasts {{so that they can}} take shelter behind each other or spread out may be the reason why land plants evolved to have many small chloroplasts instead of a few big ones.|$|E
