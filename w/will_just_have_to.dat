According to documents produced in December 1940, the annexed territory would consist of nine French departments, and the Germanization action would require the settlement of a million Germans from [...] "peasant families". Himmler decided that South Tyrolean emigrants (see South Tyrol Option Agreement) would be used as settlers, and the towns of the region would receive South Tyrolean place-names such as Bozen, Brixen, Meran, and so on. By 1942 Hitler had, however, decided that the South Tyroleans would be instead used to settle the Crimea, and Himmler regretfully noted [...] "For Burgundy, we <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> find another [...] ethnic group." ...|$|E
500|$|First Contact {{garnered}} positive reviews on release. Ryan Gilbey of The Independent {{considered the}} film wise {{to dispense with}} the cast of The Original Series: [...] "For the first time, a Star Trek movie actually looks like something more ambitious than an extended TV show," [...] he wrote. Conversely, critic Bob Thompson felt that First Contact was more {{in the spirit of}} the 1960s television series than any previous installment. The Globe and Mail Elizabeth Renzeti said that First Contact succeeded in improving on the [...] "stilted" [...] previous entry in the series, and that it featured a renewed interest in storytelling. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "First Contact does everything you'd want a Star Trek film to do, and it does it with cheerfulness and style." [...] Adrian Martin of The Age noted that the film was geared towards pleasing fans: [...] "Strangers to this fanciful world first delineated by Gene Roddenberry <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> struggle to comprehend as best they can," [...] he wrote, but [...] "cult-followers will be in heaven". The New York Times Janet Maslin said that the [...] "film's convoluted plot will boggle all but hard-core devotees" [...] of the series, while Variety Joe Leydon wrote that the film did not require intimate knowledge of the series and that fans and non-fans alike would enjoy the film. While Renzetti considered the lack of old characters from the previous seven movies a welcome change, Maslin said that without the original stars, [...] "The series now lacks [...] much of its earlier determination. It has morphed into something less innocent and more derivative than it used to be, something the noncultist is never less likely to enjoy." [...] For one thing, this film's convoluted plot will boggle all but hard-core devotees. }} Conversely, Roger Ebert called First Contact one of the best Star Trek films, and James Berardinelli found the film the most entertaining Star Trek feature in a decade; [...] "It has single-handedly revived the Star Trek movie series, at least from a creative point of view," [...] he wrote.|$|E

2500|$|On December 23, 2007, Bryant {{became the}} {{youngest}} player (29 years, 122 days) to reach 20,000 points, {{in a game against}} the New York Knicks, in Madison Square Garden.

Despite an injury to his shooting hand's small finger, described as [...] "a complete tear of the radial collateral ligament, an avulsion fracture, and a volar plate injury at the MCP joint" [...] that occurred in a game on February 5, 2008, Bryant played all 82 games of the regular season instead of opting for surgery. Regarding his injury, he stated, [...] "I would prefer to delay any surgical procedure until after our Lakers season, and this summer's Olympic Games. But, this is an injury that [...] and the Lakers' medical staff <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> continue to monitor on a day-to-day basis."

2500|$|Her loss in The Voice of the Philippines did {{not stop}} her career as Morissette went on with TV guestings, mall tours, and other {{activities}} together with her fellow Voice of the Philippines finalists. Despite her departure from the competition, comparisons between her and Sarah Geronimo, her mentor, continued to hound her. This was not helped {{by the fact that}} the two have a striking resemblance to each other, an observation which Sarah herself acknowledged during the blind audition, and was noticed as early as her 2010 audition for Talentadong Pinoy. Moreover, even at the outset two judges in the audition noted similarities in the vocal style of the two singers, which was unsurprising given that Amon has always acknowledged Geronimo as a major influence on her, to the point of calling Sarah as her [...] "idol". [...] In an interview, Amon clarified that in the beginning she felt hurt from the comparisons, but at present she considers it an honor. She further elaborated that she <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do [...] "something different" [...] and find the means to break away from the shadow of her former mentor, and thus establish her own identity.|$|E

[...] Giving the song a perfect five out of five stars review, a Popjustice writer called the song [...] "jaunty." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Chart Blog said called the song [...] "deliriously happy, {{to the point of}} being simple-minded, and conjures up instant images of warmth and sunshiney freedom in everyone that hears it." [...] McAlpine also pointed out her label's wise decision to release it right at the ending of summer, with fans pining for more of the vacation season and waiting until Christmas. FemaleFirst said [...] "the track is set to cause a long-lasting heat wave when it hits radio in July" [...] and [...] "will also be blazing club floors across the country once again."

40|$|A {{completely}} {{autonomous vehicle}} {{is one in}} which a computer performs all the tasks that the human driver normally would. This would mean, to go to a specific destination, a driver <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> key in the desired destination and the system will be enabled automatically by the computer. From there, the car would take over and drive to destination with no human input. The car would be able to sense its environment and change maneuver and speed when necessary. A system for road marking detection has been set up {{during the course of this}} master's thesis project. In the development of the software, images acquired from a front looking video camera mounted inside the vehicle were used. The problem of using computer vision to develop lane detection system for autonomous vehicle is road marking characteristic. Since the strongest characteristic of a road marking image are the edges, the road marking detection step is based on edge detection. For the detection of the straight edge lines, a Radon based method was chosen. Due to peak spreading in Radon space, the difficulty of detecting the correct peak in Radon space was encountered. A Radon peak detection algorithm was developed based on two values, Rand O. These values make the system robust to the different types of road marking such as continuous road marking, discontinuous road marking and road with shadow. The performance of the road marking detection algorithm was investigated over several different short image sequences. The different sequences included normal countly road driving, a number of different road marking configurations, such as continuous, intermittent and combinations of and images with shadows. The system performs well during the experiments within the difference road condition state above. The work done in this thesis can be used as a starting point in the development of for example a lane departure warning system. The potential of such a system is further increased by merging information retrieved from images with information from the vehicle such as vehicle speed, steering angle and acceleration...|$|R

[...] Several unique provisions were included which terminated the owner’s contract in the event that the master neglected to feed, clothe, shelter, or otherwise abused the slave, or attempted to take them from the Territory against their will. Black slaves, but not Indian slaves, were freed if the master had sexual intercourse with them. Some schooling was also required for slaves, with blacks requiring less schooling than Indians. Despite the unique provisions in Utah, many black slaves received the same treatment as in the South.
