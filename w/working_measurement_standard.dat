40|$|Analytical {{precision}} for Pb isotope measurement by thermal and {{plasma source}} mass spectrometry has improved by {{an order of}} magnitude in the last 20 years. Much of this improvement relates to a shift away from the external method of correcting instrumental mass fractionation – where samples are assumed to fractionate to the same extent as an average value of a <b>working</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>standard.</b> Implementation of a variety of techniques, including thallium spiking, sample–standard bracketing and double/triple spiking has provided more robust methods of fractionation correction. Isotope laboratories use {{one or more of these}} procedures, but an assessment of the measurement precision and relative merits of each system is needed to determine which is the most appropriate for the purpose. This study reviews each of these methods and provides a comparison based on an extensive analytical record covering 18 years, and using a variety of mass spectrometers. As two or three of the methods have been applied to most measurements, direct and robust comparisons can be made between correction protocols. In particular the effects of sample purity and variable sample matrices on measurement precision and accuracy have been examined. Data acquired from the measurement of rock, soil and metal are used to provide a statistical comparison of the analytical uncertainty of each technique, guiding the choice of the most appropriate method. Isotope standard data acquired over this period is also compared with other high-precision laboratories to generate a set of concordant working ratios for the NIST SRM 981 Pb standard: 206 Pb/ 204 Pb = 16. 9412; 207 Pb/ 204 Pb = 15. 4988; 208 Pb/ 204 Pb = 36. 7233...|$|E

40|$|<b>Measurement</b> <b>standards</b> {{are like}} {{institutional}} facts – they enable the travel of information across different domains: geographical, social, institutional or contextual. Uncovering the reasons underlying {{how and why}} <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> are adopted can provide insights into how ‘well’ such facts travel. Using the example of measurements in the London coal trade c 1830, I explore how <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> travel across different domains and why groups switch from one standard to another. In this specific example, I investigate how standardized measurements replaced the customary practice of heaped measures and, and argue that <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> replaced the system of public measurements as a mechanism to ensure transparency in transactions. I further argue that <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> were embedded in an institutional ‘package’ of artefacts, regulations and customary practices making this a process of negotiated change. Institutional facts are bounded by other institutional structures. In this case of <b>measurement</b> <b>standards,</b> facts appear to have travelled well when a change was made to the entire institutional context {{and not just the}} measurement artefact...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} ensure a {{reliable}} calibration of surface topography measuring instruments the use of practical calibration strategies is required. This requirement can be fulfilled when <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> with a defined surface structure in accordance to the later obsessed application are used. Different examples for the design and manufacturing of accordant <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> have been investigated by the authors. Within this publication a generic reverse engineering approach {{for the design of}} geometrical <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> is deducted from these results. The physical effects that occur because of the manufacturing with an ultraprecision turning machine and the sampling of the <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> are mathematically inversed and considered. The practical abilities of the approach are illustrated exemplarily. These theoretical considerations for the design can be verified experimentally by the manufacturing of the samples with an ultra-precision turning process. In doing so, the high precision of the new design approach can be validated. The examinations confirm the universality of the reverse engineering approach for the design of <b>measurement</b> <b>standards...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} provide an {{alternative}} for the vertical axis calibration of stylus instruments which is usually performed based on step height <b>standards,</b> a new <b>measurement</b> <b>standard</b> geometry for the calibration of the linearity and research on its manufacturing is needed. For the manufacturing of these geometric <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> there is, according {{to the type of}} the <b>measurement</b> <b>standard,</b> a broad range of manufacturing processes that can be applied.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Division of Acoustics and Vibration (DIAVI) of INMETRO establishes, validates and {{maintains}} the Brazilian national <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> {{used for the}} realization of the units of physical quantities related to the field of acoustics and vibration. The basic vibration quantity realized by DIAVI is translational acceleration, from which the other motion quantities, i. e., velocity and displacement can be derived. Acoustical physical quantities include sound pressure and sound power. The national <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> comprise both absolute (primary) and comparison (secondary) calibration set-ups, which are used to cover the wide range of calibration and testing services demanded by the Brazilian society, trade, industry and science. This paper outlines the current status of these <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> and presents the measurement capabilities of INMETRO in the field of acoustics and vibration...|$|R

The analysis of associated uncertainty has been undertaken through a series of case studies. Some decision rules have been proposed to guide the use of software <b>measurement</b> <b>standards.</b> Those developed software <b>measurement</b> <b>standards</b> provided a novel route to demonstrate the metrological traceability for most surface profile parameters which has not been tried before. It is expected that this route could be implemented for demonstrate all surface parameters in further development.
