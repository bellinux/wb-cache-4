50|$|Many historians or {{scholars}} {{state that}} tambos are generally placed a day's walk from each other. However, as Hyslop points out, {{there are many}} factors, both individual and external, that can affect how much one can walk in a day, which makes this description problematic. In practice, the distances between tambos vary wildly, ranging from fewer than 10km to nearly 45km. Many different factors affected the placement of these tambos. In general, the Inca <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> build them near water and favorable terrain, while they <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> avoid unfavorable terrain (such as marshes or steep slopes). In some cases, the Inca <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> build away from local population centers (for reasons unknown), but other times <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> build near local labor sources. Furthermore, tambos placement may {{have been influenced by}} the average speed of llama caravans, which would move more slowly than an individual. Another important traveler that would move more slowly than a typical individual would be the Sapa Inka. Since the Sapa Inka would travel with a grand procession, travel would be slower than if he were traveling alone, which would require closer tambo placement.|$|R
