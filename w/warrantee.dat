40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} consumers' expectations of furniture labels during the pre-purchase information search, {{in order to}} propose furniture labels that {{would serve as a}} more relevant source of external information during the consumer decision-making process. A mixed-method approach using a two-phase exploratory design was followed. The qualitative phase consisted of semi-structured interviews with experienced sales assistants, while the quantitative phase entailed a questionnaire filled out by consumers during furniture shopping. These results were used to design potential furniture labels during a final phase. Qualitative findings indicated participants' opinions regarding the appearance of and information on specific types of furniture. General information requested to be on furniture labels included price, care instructions, guarantees, <b>warrantees,</b> style and dimensions. Quantitative results showed that the majority of respondents deemed the price, materials used, cleaning instructions, guarantees and <b>warrantees</b> as important information that should appear on furniture labels. This coincided with their pre-purchase search criteria. There was no practically significant difference between consumers' expectations of the information and appearance of different types of furniture labels. Consumers therefore expect all labels to be similar in appearance and to contain general information, apart from product-specific information that would be necessary on different types of furniture, for example leather furniture. Appearance characteristics of furniture labels, such as colour, size and layout, were summarized and potential furniture labels were recommended accordingly. These labels can be used by product developers, marketers and the furniture industry to assist consumers during their pre-purchase information search. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Consumer Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Labels {{serve as}} a source of {{external}} information during the consumer decision–making process, and frequently contribute to consumers’ prior knowledge of different products as well as their search activities prior to purchase of furniture. Labelling {{of a wide range of}} products, such as food and clothing has been investigated with regard to the effectiveness of the label, to convey information and draw consumers’ attention to the product, and the usage of the labels by consumers. However, no literature suggests the existence of labels with regard to furniture items, or consumers’ expectations about furniture labels. It is believed that labels on furniture items could assist consumers during the pre–purchase information search of the decision–making process. The current study investigated consumers’ expectations of furniture labels, during the pre–purchase information search of the consumer decision–making process, in order to propose furniture labels. The objectives of the study were to determine what questions regarding product information consumers frequently ask store assistants prior to furniture purchasing; to determine consumers’ expectations regarding furniture labels in terms of the product information on the label, the appearance of the label and the placement of the label on furniture items; and finally to suggest a preliminary furniture label according to consumers’ expectations. A mixed–method research approach was followed, using a two–phase exploratory design. Qualitative findings indicated that consumers enquire about the type of materials used for the manufacturing of furniture items, finishes used on items, quality, guarantees, <b>warrantees,</b> design, performance, maintenance, care instructions and colours of items. Similarly, quantitative results showed that the majority of respondents deemed the price, materials used, cleaning instructions, guarantee and <b>warrantees</b> important to be displayed on the furniture label. Appearance characteristics were summarised and preliminary furniture labels were suggested accordingly. These labels can be used by product developers, marketers, and the furniture industry to assist consumers during their pre–purchase information search of the consumer decision–making process.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} applications of pultruded fiber-reinforced plastics used as primary load-bearing structural components by Composite Technology, Inc. (CTI). The pultruded RP profiled sections were designed specially for composite materials to compete with and replace conventional materials. These sections were made competitive by tailoring the geometry, advantageously placing fibers, and controlling the load path to overcome stiffness and engineering limitations, erection costs, and life-cycle costs. As with conventional structural materials such as steel and prestressed concrete, RP has definite predictable and measurable performance characteristics. Extensive laboratory, university, and field testing for long-term effects of deflection, bending, shear, buckling, and temperature has enabled CTI to simulate and evaluate the performance, projected through the <b>warranteed</b> period of twenty-five years. As {{a result of the}} test program, these RP structural components maximize the perfor-mance potential of both RP and the pultrusion process for civil engineering structural ap-plications. They are currently used as structural frames, beams, columns, girts, purlins, and lintels in industrial buildings, electromagnetic interference laboratory enclosures, pre-engineered buildings, and cooling towers...|$|R
5000|$|Ringing Rocks County Park is a Bucks County park in Upper Black Eddy, Pennsylvania at [...] [...] Originally, {{the land}} was {{acquired}} by the Penn family from the Lenape (Delaware Nation) through the infamous 1737 Walking Purchase. It is not clear who made the original land warrant for the area now covered by the Ringing Rocks County Park. On the 1850 property map of Bucks County, the owner appears to be Tunis Lippincott; however, there is no <b>warrantee</b> listing under that name. The earliest published description of the Bridgeton boulder field is found in Davis 1876. The seven-acre boulder field was purchased in 1895 by Abel B. Haring, president of the Union National Bank in Frenchtown, NJ. Apparently Haring wished to protect the ringing rocks from development, and even refused an offer from a manufacturer of Belgian blocks {{for the right to}} quarry the stones. (Humphreys 1905, Sigafoos 1935). On August 22, 1918, the land which contains the Bridgeton boulder field was donated by Haring to the Bucks County Historical Society. The grant included 7 acres 8.08 perches of land. A right-of-way was granted by John O. McEntee for access to the park (Fackenthal 1919). Later {{the land was}} transferred to Bucks County and operated as a county park. Additional land acquisitions have increased the size of the park to 128 acres.|$|E

Wilkinson & Co. was organized following Broderip's death in 1807. According to the family history recorded by Wilkinson's son Henry Broadhurst Wilkinson, the firm had arranged to have tall cabinet upright pianos manufactured for them by Astor and [...] "Leukenfeld" [...] by license under William Southwell's patent. Southwell, who {{was said to have}} made the first cabinet upright in 1790, described that it was [...] "so constructed as to prevent the possibility of its being so frequently out of tune", and without [...] "any opening or perforation between the sound-board and the pin block", although his 1807 patent only claimed a new arrangement of its dampers. The Monthly Magazine reported in May, 1808 that Wilkinson & Co. offered to the public [...] "a New Patent, Cabinet Piano-forte", and described that its form was [...] "as curious as convenient," [...] occupying no more room than the smallest bookcase, while its tone was both brilliant and delicate, its touch [...] "peculiarly facile and pleasant" [...] and claimed the strength and simplicity of its construction would tend [...] "to ensure its keeping in tune longer than most other instruments." [...] The Quarterly Musical Register described in early 1812 that by then these instruments were manufactured by other firms as well, and commented [...] "whether they will be adopted as preferable to the square piano forte, time must shew." [...] Wornum's son Alfred later claimed that these instruments were unsuccessful for a time and Broadhurst Wilkinson related that the firm had been obliged to furnish replacements under <b>warrantee</b> when the instruments sold by them were found not to [...] "stand well." [...] By mid-1809, however, the firm advertised that owing to [...] "the great increase of their manufactory of pianos" [...] they had determined to close down their other musical enterprises, and had reduced their entire stock of music to half price and offered favorable terms on all instruments out on hire.|$|E

40|$|Charles Dickens’s {{critique}} of the defects of the British judiciary system in Bleak House (1852 - 53) derives from his own experiences as a law clerk trying to own copyright for his earlier works. According to Althusser, the state creates secure and protected lives for the individuals and <b>warrantees</b> their consent, using what he calls ideological state apparatuses. For him, {{the power of the}} state is maintained more subtly in capitalistic systems. Bleak House not only explicates how ideological state apparatuses devour and in fact falsify the rights of the individuals within the framework of the suit called Jarndyce and Jarndyce but also fictionalises many examples about the interpellation of the individuals by these social institutions in the Victorian Age. These apparatuses in fact interpellate individuals as fixed subjects, which means that they form the individual’s very reality and therefore appear as true or obvious. Two-narratored structure of the novel lays bare the ideological conflict though, thus it becomes evident that Dickens delibaretely blends in harmony the ideological inscriptions suggested by the first and the third person narrators of the work. The artfulness of Dickens is a means to display how ideologies change and shape people’s perceptions of reality. Jarndyce and Jarndyce, the suit which last...|$|R

An increasing environmental awareness {{and the demand for}} improving economic and construction efficiencies, through measures such as construction <b>warrantees</b> and goals to reduce air pollution under the Kyoto Protocol, have increased the efforts to implement sustainable materials in roadways. The objective of this research is to develop a systematic approach toward selecting optimum combinations of sustainable materials for the construction of asphalt pavements. The selected materials, warm mix asphalt (WMA), recycled asphalt shingles (RAS), and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) were incorporated in this study. The results of this research are intended to serve as guidelines in the selection of the mixed sustainable materials for asphalt pavements. The approach developed from this project draws upon previous research efforts integrating graphical modeling with optimizing the amount of sustainable materials based on the performance. With regard to moisture susceptibility and rutting potential test results, as well as the MIM analysis based on a 95 % confidence interval, the rutting performance and moisture susceptibility of asphalt mixtures are not significantly different regardless of the percentages of RAS, RAP, or WMA. The optimum mixture choices could be made by the plant emission rankings with consideration of the optimal WMA types, percentages of RAS/RAP, and WMA production temperatures. The WMA mixtures prepared with 75 % RAP and Advera® WMA have produced the lowest CO 2 emissions among the investigated mixture types...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if it was feasible to collect information regarding energy use and hot water delivery from tankless gas water heaters using the sensors and controls built into the water heaters. This could then be used to determine the water heater efficiency ? the ratio of energy out (hot water delivered) to energy in (energy in the gas) in actual residential installations. The goal was to be as unobtrusive as possible, and to avoid invalidating warranties or exposing researchers to liability issues. If feasible this approach would reduce the costs of instrumentation. This paper describes the limited field and laboratory investigations to determine if using the sensors and controls built into tankless water heaters is feasible for field monitoring. It was more complicated to use the existing gas flow, water and temperature sensors than was anticipated. To get the signals from the existing sensors and controls is difficult and may involve making changes that would invalidate manufacturer <b>warrantees.</b> The procedures and methods for using signals from the existing gas valves, water flow meters and temperature sensors will vary by model. To be able to monitor different models and brands would require detailed information about each model and brand. Based on these findings, we believe that for field monitoring projects it would be easier, quicker and safer to connect external meters to measure the same parameters rather than using the sensors and controls built into tankless water heaters...|$|R

The first three program tasks were devoted to: (1) gathering background information on competitors and their methods of manufacturing; (2) establishing experimental and evaluation procedures for the program; (3) identifying potential desiccants, supports and binders to be tested; (4) preparing matrix combinations on a laboratory scale; (5) testing component combinations for equilibrium moisture uptakes at different relative humidities (isotherms) and dynamic moisture adsorption rates; (6) using media adsorption properties to models to predict exchanger performance; (7) estimating ease of manufacture and finished wheel costs; and (8) calculating raw material, wheel and cassette costs based on the best media formulations. Since the rotary enthalpy exchangers have high rotational speeds, uptake rate is at least as important as equilibrium moisture uptake. Therefore, a procedure and apparatus were developed to determine adsorption rate so that the Lewis number (the ratio of mass transfer resistance to heat transfer resistance) could be calculated. The calculated values for different media materials could then be used for performance model predictions. Based on the results achieved, three systems have been selected as enthalpy exchange media candidates for the next phase of work.
