ACP and other Southern {{countries}} command a fifth of this market, where you never cut corners, nor quality. Is it curtains for coffee, cotton, tea and cocoa? Horticultural exports of vegetables and flowers from some African countries have soared since the early 1990 s, whilst traditional agriculture has stood still. The export of flowers from several countries in eastern and southern Africa to the European and North American markets has grown spectacularly in recent years. Between 1990 and 1995, sales of Zimbabwean roses on the British market increased tenfold. More modestly, sales of Kenyan carnations rose by a mere 117 %. Behind this surge lies the fact that Dutch and German companies have set themselves up in the countries concerned, investing heavily to control the horticultural sector. Local farmers have organised themselves into cooperatives to form holdings of 50 hectares and more and have thrown themselves headlong into flower production, sometimes {{with the support of}} associations, such as the Zambian Export Growers Association. Traditionally the international wholesale flower market was centred on the auction halls of the Netherlands, with their clock-like dials of descending prices. Today production and marketing have been restructured. In Zambia, for example, a central purchasing agency known as Agriflora buys direct from producers and shortcuts the auction halls by selling direct to the supermarkets of Europe and North America. And the international horticultural market is not just confined to flowers : other fresh product lines are being developed for the markets of the North, such as asparagus, courgettes (zucchini) and parsley. The overall chain of production and marketing in fruits and vegetables is long, and the central buying houses {{play a key role in}} it. The production of green beans from southern and eastern Africa is absorbed by the United Kingdom, and that of central and western Africa by the French market. Need for perfection and professional standards The efforts made to capture the key Dutch markets has led to lower shop prices, but they have affected quality, since professional checks are no longer carried out. One specialist with experience in Kenya underlines that the flowers have to look perfect to command the market price. This means that everything has to work smoothly, like clockwork, all along the cold chain that takes the chilled flowers from the site of production, through the airport, to the wholesaler. Just one small error in programming, just the slightest delay, and the produce will arrive in poor condition, or delayed, in Europe. The consequences will be serious for the producer. Competition is growing too. The total volume of ACP produce on the European market may be growing, but their market share is shrinking. The lack of professional standards on the part of some producers is to blame, as are the cumbersome formalities which increase delays at the harbours and airports. The quality of ACP produce has stayed stable, though, over the last twenty years. Kenya is now the <b>world</b> <b>s</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>largest</b> producer of cut flowers after the Netherlands, Colombia and Israel, but it is these countries which continue to improve the quality of their produce. Other countries, such as Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe have seen their horticultural exports increase over recent years, but they still have to face up to the tremendous challenge of professional standards. Among their competitors are Thailand, the Canary Islands and Singapore. It is a worrying wave Faced with this wave of fashionable produce, what does the future hold in store for the traditional food and cash crops of cocoa, coffee, cotton and so on? One farmer member of the Union of Agricultural and Horticultural Cooperatives of Burkina Faso (UCOBAM), quoted by Mamadou Aly Ba of the Geneva-based IUED, expressed his concern at this trend: 'We started by growing cotton, but after three years we were forced to switch over to green beans. That s where things started to go wrong for us, because we do not know how to market them, and the UCOBAM is not familiar with the crop. ' This problem was addressed at a seminar organised by CTA in October 1995 in Dublin, and at two other meetings held by CTA in Madrid in 1998 and 1999 on the marketing and distribution of perishable agricultural food and fish products. Attention was focussed on problems of organisation in the sector, the role of intermediaries, the role of the State as well as infrastructural issues. Participants at those meetings called for streamlining the distribution and marketing chain, increasing the influence of producers and improving cooperation between various stakeholders. Will these steps be taken? Surely some positive action has to be taken if we are to avoid the all-too-obvious possible results of an expanding market for horticultural and flower produce: lower prices for the consumer in the North and falling income for the producers of the South.

This paper reviews the literature on management in the wine industry and reports findings from a pilot study of managerial competencies based on interviews with the owners of small wineries. Preliminary results suggest that winery owners enjoy the production aspect of making wine, but have limited business and management skiffs.

40|$|A {{reliable}} and safe water supply {{is fundamental to}} all human existence. The Egyptians, Babylonians, Greeks and Romans built aqueducts two thousand years ago, to ensure such a supply. Over the ensuing millennium, such aqueducts continued to bring water from far springs and rivers to communities as far apart as Cairo in Egypt and the Aztec communities at Michoacan and Queretaro in Mexico. In medieval times, engineers at Bruges constructed an underground water supply tunnel with a terminal bucket-to-cistern and chain-wheel-lift {{by the end of}} the thirteenth century. Archaeological evidence of many of these constructions remain today as symbols not only of the origins of pragmatic public health, but as witnesses of municipal foresight and engineering skill. A singular engineering feat - to provide a town with unlimited; clean, odourless and tasteless water - was the construction in 1591 of the Plymouth or Drake 2 ̆ 7 s Leat.

But the ability to maximize this potential is far from certain and depends on avariety of social and economic underpinnings, including key issues associated withhuman resource capacity and gender equality that will determine how well Indonesiais placed to meet the challenges involved. This contribution first reviews the historyof demographic and social transformations, including the dramatic shift from anti- topro-natalist policies that have occurred in Indonesia since independence. Set againsta deterministic trend of an age-sex specific population projection, we seek to providean assessment of these past trends in demographic and social dynamics in relationshipto the current state of preparedness, with a focus on social and gender-related issues. Finally, we will outline several of the key challenges, particularly in the context of thecurrent socio-economic and political climate that will ultimately determine whetherIndonesia will move into a future real demographic dividend or only observe the worldthrough a window of opportunity...|$|R

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{construct of}} control {{has been defined}} as necessary (Etzioni, 1965), ubiquitous (Vickers, 1967), and on-going (E. Langer, 1983). Empirical measures, however, have not adequately given meaning to this potent construct, especially within complex organizations such as schools. Four stages of theory-development and empirical testing of school building managerial control using principals and teachers working within the nation 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>largest</b> district are presented in this dissertation as follows: (1) a review and synthesis of social science theories of control across the literatures of organizational theory, political science, sociology, psychology, and philosophy; (2) a systematic analysis of school managerial activities performed at the building level within the context of curricular and instructional tasks; (3) the development of a survey questionnaire to measure school building managerial control; and (4) initial tests of construct validity including inter-item reliability statistics, principal components analyses, and multivariate tests of significance. The social science synthesis provided support of four managerial control processes: standards, information, assessment, and incentives. The systematic analysis of school managerial activities led to further categorization between structural frequency of behaviors and discretionary qualities of behaviors across each of the control processes and the curricular and instructional tasks. Teacher survey responses (N= 486) reported a significant difference between these two dimensions of control, structural frequency and discretionary qualities, for standards, information, and assessments, but not for incentives. The descriptive model of school managerial control suggests that (1) teachers perceive structural and discretionary managerial behaviors under information and incentives more clearly than activities representing standards or assessments, (2) standards are primarily structural while assessments are primarily qualitative, (3) teacher satisfaction is most closely related to the equitable distribution of incentives, (4) each of the structural managerial behaviors has a qualitative effect on teachers, and that (5) certain qualities of managerial behaviors are perceived by teachers as distinctly discretionary, apart from school structure. The variables of teacher tenure and school effectiveness reported significant effects on school managerial control processes, while instructional levels (elementary, junior, and senior) and individual school differences were not found to be significant for the construct of school managerial control...|$|R
