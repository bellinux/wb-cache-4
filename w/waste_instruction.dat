40|$|The authors {{provide a}} common {{platform}} for modeling different schemes {{for reducing the}} branch-delay penalty in pipelined processors as well as evaluating the associated increased instruction bandwidth. Their objective is twofold: to develop a model for different approaches to the branch problem and to help select an optimal strategy after taking into account additional i-traffic generated by branch strategies. The model presented provides a flexible tool for comparing different branch strategies {{in terms of the}} reduction it offers in average branch delay and also in terms of the associated cost of <b>wasted</b> <b>instruction</b> fetches. This additional criterion {{turns out to be a}} valuable consideration in choosing between two strategies that perform almost equally. More importantly, it provides a better insight into the expected overall system performance. Simple compiler-support-based low-implementation-cost strategies can be very effective under certain conditions. An active branch prediction scheme based on loop buffers can be as competitive as a branch-target-buffer based strategy...|$|R

Although it is said that processing factories strictly follow the current <b>waste</b> disposal <b>instructions</b> and regulations of the Vietnamese government, there is a failure to monitor suppliers’ waste-disposal processes {{because of a lack of}} awareness of farmers and collectors. It is not even possible to control the use of fertilisers and pesticides if the farmers do not participate in any certified coffee programs and do not follow their instructions. However, they believe that if farmers and local collectors join a sustainable coffee program, their waste-disposal processes, and use of fertilisers and pest control are controlled and managed properly due to the introduction of related actors to train and educate farmers on the benefits of sustainable and safe farming practices.|$|R
40|$|Achieving high {{performance}} on modern CPUs requires efficient utilization of SIMD units. Doing so requires that algorithms {{are able to}} take full advantage of the SIMD width offered and to not <b>waste</b> SIMD <b>instructions</b> on low utilization cases. Ray tracers exploit SIMD extensions through packet tracing. This re-casts the ray tracing algorithm into a SIMD framework, but high SIMD efficiency is only achieved for moderately complex scenes, and highly coherent packets. In this paper, we present a stream programming oriented traversal algorithm that processes streams of rays in SIMD fashion; the algorithm is motivated by breadth-first ray traversal and implicitly re-orders streams of rays on the fly by removing deactivated rays after each traversal step using a stream compaction step. This improves SIMD efficiency in the presence of complex scenes and diverging packets, and is, in particular, designed for potential wider-than-four SIMD architectures with scatter/gather support...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Conditional branch {{prediction}} {{remains one of}} the most important enabling technologies for high-performance microprocessors. A small improvement in accuracy can result in a large improvement in performance as well as a significant reduction in energy <b>wasted</b> on wrong-path <b>instructions.</b> Neuralbased branch predictors have been among the most accurate in the literature. The recently proposed scaled neural analog predictor, or SNAP, builds on piecewise-linear {{branch prediction}} and relies on a mixed analog/digital implementation to mitigate latency as well as power requirements over previous neural predictors. We present an optimized version of the SNAP predictor, hybridized with two simple two-level adaptive predictors. The resulting optimized predictor, OH-SNAP, delivers very high accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art predictors...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of students entering college lack the academic skills necessary to perform well at the college level, forcing professors and academic institutions to lower standards. Students approach higher education as a commodity, and as consumers they assert their desire for easier course work by giving poor evaluations to instructors whose courses they find too demanding or difficult. Eliminating student evaluations is one necessary change that will help reverse declining standards in higher education and increase performance; providing effective venues for supplemental instruction is another. Teaching basic writing skills in freshman composition courses would <b>waste</b> valuable <b>instruction</b> time that must be spent on higher-order concerns, such as critical thinking, abstract reasoning, essay development, and research skills. Online writing labs offer lower-order instruction in grammar, punctuation, syntax, and style for students at any level, as do the learning programs that accompany composition textbooks and handbooks, yet these resources are under-utilized by students who need the most help. Usability studies would reveal site-specific reasons students avoid or abandon them. This paper includes an initial view of two online writing resources {{from the perspective of}} usability: what works about the design and functionality, and what most likely does not...|$|R

The classification of phosphogypsum as dangerous waste may be only maintained {{under the condition that}} phosphates with the highest content of radio nuclides are used in the production of H 3 PO 4 by the so called "wet procedure" (Morocco, Florida), which, due to the great quantity of present radio nuclides, causes considerable environmental pollution by radon. The classification of phosphogypsum as a separate category of radioactive waste may be conditionally accepted, because phosphogypsum is not a radioactive <b>waste.</b> All the <b>instructions</b> about the collection, documentation and storage of phosphogypsum so far on disposal sites, and possible transport, also due to non-existing legal recommendations must comply with the classification of phosphogypsum as dangerous waste...|$|R

40|$|Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) is a {{technique}} to execute multiple threads in parallel in a single processor pipeline. An SMT processor has shared instruction queues and functional units and these resources are utilized efficiently without being <b>wasted.</b> Because the <b>instruction</b> queues and functional units are shared by multiple threads, {{it is very important}} to decide which threads to fetch instructions from every cycle. This paper investigates 2 -level fetch policies and other techniques with a view to improve both throughput and fairness. To measure the potential of the 2 -level fetch policies, simulations are conducted on 4 different benchmark combinations with two SMT configurations, and simulation results are compared with those of ICOUNT and LC-BPCOUNT, two existing fetch policies. Our detailed experimental evaluation confirms that the 2 -level fetch policies outperform both ICOUNT and LC-BPCOUNT in terms of throughput, as well as fairness. As a way to improve fairness, we also investigate the idea of partially partitioning the instruction queues among the threads. In particular, we vary the partition size to see how both throughput and fairness are impacted. From this experiment, we found that more fairness can be obtained at the cost of throughput. We expect the techniques presented in this paper to play a major role in future SMT designs...|$|R

Thirty four teachers and 89 children participated. Correlation and hierarchical multiple regression were computed to assess the strength of the relationships between the predictor and criterion variables. Research question 1 asked how teacher’s learner-centered use of time in the early childhood classroom, (EECCS), was related to Head Start classroom interactions and child engagement, (CLASS and inCLASS). Results indicated that EECCS was not a statistically significant predictor of CLASS scores or inCLASS scores. Research question 2 asked how teacher beliefs, (TBS), were related to Head Start classroom teacher-child interactions (CLASS), and Head Start classroom teacher-child, peer-peer, and child-material interactions, (inCLASS). No statistically significant results were found. Research question 3 asked how the early childhood classroom schedule moderated the relationship between developmentally appropriate teacher beliefs and Head Start Classroom interactions. No statistically significant results were found. Supplementary analyses were performed with activity settings and yielded several significant findings. Statistically significant changes were found for all instruments from fall to spring. Teacher beliefs and the classroom schedule were statistically significantly correlated.

30|$|The {{objective}} of green {{supply chain management}} is to eliminate or minimize waste (energy, hazardous greenhouse gas/chemical emissions, and solid <b>waste).</b> Under customer <b>instructions</b> agreed upon by the European Union and Japan, environmental problems have become a major concern of manufacturers. Green supply chain management helps organizations to develop strategies which lead {{to a higher level}} of profitability by reducing environmental risks and increasing environmental efficiency (Abbasi et al. 2016). Due to high contribution of steel industry to contamination of the environment, green supply chain implementation is particularly essential in this industry. Clemens (2001) declares that the steel industry is the biggest manufacturing source of environmental contamination in the US Therefore, application of green supply chain model results in lower contamination and costs related to environmental aspects of supply chain management. Moreover, a lack of implementation of green supply chain models in developing countries with large steel industry was studied by Zhu and Sarkis (2004) and Kumar and Shekhar (2015). Zhu and Sarkis (2004) revealed that just 4.8 % of steel companies in China are applying green supply chain management. Kumar and Shekhar (2015) provided an assessment of the degree of implementation of green supply chain management in the state of Chhattisgarh steel manufacturers in India. According to their observation, a few steel manufacturers in that region applied green supply chain management. Providing a green supply chain model for steel industries in developing countries assists them to become more environmentally friendly and achieve a higher level of efficiency. Vahdani et al. (2012) provided an integrated facility location in closed-loop supply chain network for steel facilities using queuing theory and fuzzy multi-objective programming.|$|R
