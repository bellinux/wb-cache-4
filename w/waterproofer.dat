50|$|Work {{began in}} 2010, when the {{downstream}} {{face of the}} main dam was cleaned and loose concrete, efflorescence and other surface deposits were removed. The concrete face was then protected from further deterioration by using a cementitious repair mortar and siloxane <b>waterproofer.</b> The remedial works on the upstream face included the installation of a PVC geocomposite membrane, geonet drainage layer and associated drainage system to the upstream face of the main dam and the auxiliary overflow. The geomembrane is sealed on the concrete face along the foundation line and on the parapet wall 300 mm above the crest level to cover the joint between the upstream face and the parapet wall. The geomembrane covers a total surface area of 1,100m2.|$|E

The tongue of each T-beam was 3 in thick, and the height of the T-beam 19 in. A 2 in thick layer of concrete was laid atop the T-beams, forming the floor of the pool. Five layers of roofing felt were laid atop the concrete floor, followed by a 6 in layer of perlite. A grid of concrete beams, each 6 by 13 in and over 30 ft long, was laid in the perlite to support the layers above. Inverted U-shaped drainage tiles were inserted between the beams to help remove any water which leaked from above. A 0.006 in thick sheet of polyethylene formed a moisture barrier above the perlite, and 6 in thick layer of concrete laid atop the moisture barrier. The bottom of the pool consisted of another five layers of roofing felt, on top of which were laid a 1.5 in thick layer of gravel.

40|$|This {{document}} {{represents a}} collaborative effort of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA), the Asphalt Roofing Manufacturers' Association (ARMA), the Asphalt Institute (AI), and the United Union of Roofers, <b>Waterproofers,</b> and Allied Workers (UURWAW) to reduce worker exposures to asphalt fumes during the application of hot asphalt to roofs. This guide is for roofers and contractors who work with hot asphalt on roofs. The guide lists steps for reducing exposure to asphalt fumes. Roofers exposed to asphalt fumes may experience the following health effects: headache; eye, nose, throat, and skin irritation; nausea; fatigue; and, drowsiness. These effects appear to be mild and transient. According to some studies, roofers also have {{an increased risk of}} lung cancer. But researchers are not sure whether this risk is caused by exposure to asphalt fumes or to other hazards such as smoking, coal tar, or asbestos. In light of this possible health risk and the irritation effects associated with hot asphalt work, it makes sense to take steps to control exposures while government, industry, labor, and independent researchers continue to study these health concerns. NIOSH is working together with industry and labor representatives to find methods that will significantly reduce asphalt fume exposures for roofers and contractors. Efforts are under way to identify new engineering controls and to test their effectiveness in reducing fume exposures at the kettle. To date, {{studies have shown that the}} use of fume-suppressing roofing asphalts can reduce fume exposure at the kettle. As these studies are completed, appropriate recommendations will be developed and disseminated. " [...] NIOSHTIC- 2 "September 2003. ...|$|R
