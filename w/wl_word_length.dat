40|$|The <b>word</b> <b>length</b> {{effect is}} {{the finding that}} short items are remembered better than long items on {{immediate}} serial recall tests. The time-based <b>word</b> <b>length</b> effect refers to this finding when the lists comprise items that vary only in pronunciation time. Three experiments compared recall of three different sets of disyllabic words that differed systematically only in spoken duration. One set showed a <b>word</b> <b>length</b> effect, one set showed no effect of <b>word</b> <b>length,</b> and the third showed a reverse <b>word</b> <b>length</b> effect, with long words recalled better than short. A new fourth set of words was created, and it also failed to yield a time-based <b>word</b> <b>length</b> effect.

In fact, the study of <b>word</b> <b>length</b> {{can be traced back to}} a hundred year long tradition (as to a historical and methodological survey of these studies, cf. Grzybek 2004). Knowing this historical background, it is evident that <b>word</b> <b>length,</b> as it is studied today, is no isolated characteristic. 2 The basic question of the present study is to what degree <b>word</b> <b>length</b> may contribute to the discrimination of authors and genres. An answer to this question will not only shed light on specic factors inuencing word length; it will also provide an argument if <b>word</b> <b>length</b> is an appropriate variable to describe an author's individual style, or the stylistic traits of specic genres. The discussion of these questions has a history of its own: as opposed to the eld of quantitative typology of texts (cf. Alekseev 1988, Pieper 1979), approaches in the realm of stylometry (cf. Martynenko 1988) assume that the individual style of texts and/or authors can be quantitatively described. Part of this research has concentrated on the question of authorship attribution, particularly applying quantitative methods to decide doubtful cases of au-thorship (cf. Marusenko 1990).

40|$|Abstract]: The <b>word</b> <b>length</b> {{effect has}} been a central feature of theorising about {{immediate}} memory. The notion that short-term memory traces rapidly decay unless refreshed by rehearsal is based primarily upon the finding that serial recall for short words is better than that for long words. The decay account of the <b>word</b> <b>length</b> effect has come under pressure in recent times. The current research tests alternative explanations of the <b>word</b> <b>length</b> effect, ones that suggest firstly, that <b>word</b> <b>length</b> effects should be found in long-term memory tasks. Secondly, one alternative predicts that the standard short-word advantage should only be observed in tasks in which participants use serial order memory. In tasks where only item memory is used, the approach predicts a long word advantage. Consistent with this notion, standard <b>word</b> <b>length</b> effects were found in long-term serial recall and free recall tasks, but a long word advantage was found in item recognition and cued recall tasks...|$|R

To my knowledge, no Eskimo‐Aleut data have been the object of quantitative linguistic investigation so far.

So far, <b>word</b> <b>length</b> distribution in texts {{of a wide variety of}} languages and genres has been demonstrated to follow distributions of the compound Poisson family of discrete probability distributions. In view of the morphological idiosyncrasies of the Eskimo language in general, which are responsible for an unusually high mean <b>word</b> <b>length</b> of about 4. 5 to 5. 2 syllables per word in the texts, it is interesting to see whether Eskimo texts show a significantly different behaviour with respect to <b>word</b> <b>length.</b> The results demonstrate that the Eskimo data employed in this study can be fitted well by the Hyperpoisson distribution. Two further discrete probability distributions will be deduced from certain morphology‐based assumptions about Eskimo.
