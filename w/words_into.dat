5|$|Hancock's General Order Number 40 {{was quickly}} {{condemned}} by Republicans in Washington, especially by the Radicals, while President Johnson wholeheartedly approved. Heedless {{of the situation}} in Washington, Hancock soon put his <b>words</b> <b>into</b> action, refusing local Republican politicians' requests to use his power to overturn elections and court verdicts, while also letting it be known that open insurrection would be suppressed. Hancock's popularity within the Democratic party grew {{to the extent that he}} was considered a potential presidential nominee for that party in the 1868 election. Although Hancock collected a significant number of delegates at the 1868 convention, his presidential possibilities went unfulfilled. Even so, he was henceforth identified as a rare breed in politics: one who believed in the Democratic Party's principles of states' rights and limited government, but whose anti-secessionist sentiment was unimpeachable.|$|E

25|$|The lexicon is a {{catalogue}} of words and terms that are stored in a speaker's mind. The lexicon consists of words and bound morphemes, which are parts of words that can't stand alone, like affixes. In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered {{to be part of}} the lexicon. Dictionaries represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included. Lexicography, closely linked with the domain of semantics, is the science of mapping the <b>words</b> <b>into</b> an encyclopedia or a dictionary. The creation and addition of new <b>words</b> (<b>into</b> the lexicon) is called coining or neologization, and the new words are called neologisms.|$|E

The {{division of}} a <b>word</b> <b>into</b> groups of letters which, when assigned their numerical {{positions in the}} alphabet, provide group totals which, together, have a generic numerical structure, can therefore {{be referred to as}} numerical charades...|$|R
25|$|While his poetic {{forms and}} themes share an {{affinity}} with the Romantic tradition, Cummings' work universally shows a particular idiosyncrasy of syntax, or way of arranging individual <b>words</b> <b>into</b> larger phrases and sentences. Many {{of his most}} striking poems do not involve any typographical or punctuation innovations at all, but purely syntactic ones.|$|E
25|$|Isolated Chinese words {{also began}} to enter Korean from the 1st century BC, but the main influx {{occurred}} in the 7th and 8th centuries after the unification of the peninsula by Silla. The flow of Chinese <b>words</b> <b>into</b> Korean became overwhelming after the establishment of civil service examinations in 958.|$|E
25|$|As in his {{commentary}} on the Tanakh, Rashi frequently illustrates {{the meaning of the}} text using analogies to the professions, crafts, and sports of his day. He also translates difficult Hebrew or Aramaic <b>words</b> <b>into</b> the spoken French language of his day, giving latter-day scholars a window into the vocabulary and pronunciation of Old French.|$|E

25|$|Magical language, {{according}} to C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards's (1923) categories of speech, {{is distinct from}} scientific language because it is emotive and it converts <b>words</b> <b>into</b> symbols for emotions. On the other hand, in scientific language, words are tied to specific meanings and refer to an objective external reality. Magical language is therefore particularly adept at constructing metaphors that establish symbols and link magical rituals to the world.|$|E
25|$|The {{assimilation}} of new English <b>words</b> <b>into</b> Polish sped {{up in the}} 20th century and gradually English replaced Czech, German, French, Italian and other languages as {{the primary source of}} new imports into the Polish language. At {{the turn of the century}} there were roughly 250 English words in use, by 1961 the number of English lexemes in Polish rose to over 700, breaking 1000 lexemes in the 1980s and at least 1600 in 1994.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the hiragana syllabary, which is used for Japanese words not covered by kanji and for grammatical inflections, the katakana syllabary usage is quite similar to italics in English; specifically, it is used for transcription of foreign language <b>words</b> <b>into</b> Japanese and the writing of loan words (collectively gairaigo); for emphasis; to represent onomatopoeia; for technical and scientific terms; and for names of plants, animals, minerals, and often Japanese companies.|$|E

25|$|When Testimony was {{published}} in the West in 1979, Shostakovich's overall anti-Stalinist tone and specific comments about the anti-totalitarian content hidden in the Fifth, Seventh and Eleventh Symphonies were held suspect initially. They were in some ways a complete about-face from the comments the West had received over the years, many times in the composer's words. Questions also arose over Solomon Volkov's role—to what degree he was a compiler of previously written material, a transcriber of the composer's actual words from interviews, or an author essentially putting <b>words</b> <b>into</b> the composer's mouth.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} of Samuel's translation is its accuracy and faithfulness to the original. Some critics {{have been concerned}} that he introduced a number of Arabic <b>words</b> <b>into</b> Hebrew, and, by analogy with the Arabic, he gives to certain Hebrew words meanings different from the accepted ones. But generally the scope and success of his work are not questioned. Especially admirable is the skill with which he reproduces in Hebrew the abstract ideas of Maimonides, as Hebrew is essentially a language of a people expressing concrete ideas.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} Old Portuguese {{period was}} marked by the {{publication}} of the Cancioneiro Geral by Garcia de Resende, in 1516. The early times of Modern Portuguese, which spans the period from the 16th century to the present day, were characterized by {{an increase in the number}} of learned words borrowed from Classical Latin and Classical Greek because of the Renaissance, which greatly enriched the lexicon. Most literate Portuguese speakers were also literate in Latin; and thus they easily adopted Latin <b>words</b> <b>into</b> their writing—and eventually speech—in Portuguese.|$|E

25|$|A {{comparison}} of the lexical content can find more subtle differences between the languages. For example, Occitan has 128 synonyms related to cultivated land, 62 for wetlands, and 75 for sunshine (Géo). The language went through an eclipse during the Industrial Revolution, as the vocabulary of the countryside became less important. At the same time, it was disparaged as a patois. Nevertheless, Occitan has also incorporated new <b>words</b> <b>into</b> its lexicon to describe the modern world. The Occitan word for web is oèb, for example.|$|E
25|$|Some modern {{historians have}} {{considered}} Josephus’s ostensible citations of Menander from a literary-analysis standpoint. The important question {{that they were}} addressing was whether Josephus’s quotations were just that, or were another example of his putting his own ideas and <b>words</b> <b>into</b> someone else’s mouth (pen). Josephus was frequently bold to do just this, notably in cases such as when a general, addressing his troops, provided an opportunity for Josephus to display his own eloquence. However, three lines of evidence indicate {{that this was not}} the case with the texts purporting to come from Menander. The first line of evidence is literary.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} of the Khoisan's original presence in South Africa is the distribution of their languages today. Khoisan language groups often have extreme differences in structure and vocabulary despite close proximity, which demonstrates {{a long period of}} settlement and co-evolution of languages in the same region. In contrast, the languages of Bantu-origin peoples in the region such as the Zulu and Xhosa are all very similar to one another. This indicates a much more recent common ancestry for the first Bantu group that spread and settled across the region. Among their descendants, the Xhosa and Zulu adopted unique Khoisan click consonants and loan <b>words</b> <b>into</b> their respective languages.|$|E

25|$|Sino-Xenic or Sinoxenic pronunciations are regular {{systems for}} reading Chinese in Japan, Korea and Vietnam, {{originating}} in medieval {{times and the}} source of large-scale borrowings of Chinese <b>words</b> <b>into</b> the Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese languages, none of which are genetically related to Chinese. The resulting Sino-Japanese, Sino-Korean and Sino-Vietnamese vocabularies now make up {{a large part of the}} lexicons of these languages. The pronunciation systems are used alongside modern varieties of Chinese in historical Chinese phonology, particularly the reconstruction of the sounds of Middle Chinese. Some other languages, such as Hmong–Mien and Tai-Kadai languages, also contain large numbers of Chinese loanwords but without the systematic correspondences that characterize Sino-Xenic vocabularies.|$|E
25|$|With {{the rise}} in Anglophone media and global spread of British and American {{cultures}} in the 20th and 21st centuries, many English terms have entered popular usage in other tongues. Technology-related English words like internet and computer are particularly common across the globe, as there are no pre-existing words for them. English words are sometimes imported verbatim, and sometimes adapted to the importing language in a process similar to anglicisation. In languages with non-Latin alphabets, these borrowed words can be written in the Latin alphabet anyway, resulting in a text {{made up of a}} mixture of scripts; other times they are transliterated. Transliteration of English and other foreign <b>words</b> <b>into</b> Japanese generally uses the katakana script.|$|E
25|$|Liberman et al. {{found that}} no 4-year-olds and only 17% of 5-year-olds {{were able to}} tap out the number of phonemes (individual sounds) in a word. 70% of 6-year-olds {{were able to do}} so. This might mean that {{children}} are aware of syllables as units of speech early on, while they don’t show awareness of individual phonemes until school age. Another explanation is that individual sounds do not easily translate into beats, which makes clapping individual phonemes a much more difficult task than clapping syllables. One reason why phoneme awareness gets much better once children start school is because learning to read provides a visual aid as how to break up <b>words</b> <b>into</b> their smaller constituents.|$|E
