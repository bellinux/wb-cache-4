50|$|Subsequent to {{founding}} Celebration, Disney followed {{its plans}} to divest most of its control of the town. Several Disney business units continue to occupy the town's office buildings, and two utility companies, Smart City Telecom and Reedy Creek Energy Services, both operated from Walt Disney World, provide services to the town.

50|$|Near the {{crossing}} of Reedy Creek, US 192 enters the Reedy Creek Improvement District (Walt Disney World), although the highway remains under state ownership, unlike other {{roads in the}} RCID. Both {{sides of the road}} are owned by Disney and kept empty, so US 192 has a short freeway section through Disney World. An interchange provides access to <b>World</b> <b>Drive,</b> the main north - south road in Disney World, and then US 192 crosses Interstate 4 (State Road 400), the end of Disney property. The north side again is filled with tourist attractions, while the south side is at first part of Celebration, Disney's planned community.|$|E
5000|$|At mile 57, I-4 enters Osceola County {{and soon}} {{thereafter}} intersects the Orlando area's beltways: the incomplete Western Expressway (SR 429) {{on the western}} side and the Central Florida GreeneWay (SR 417) which rounds the eastern side before returning to I-4 in Sanford. Additionally, an exit to <b>World</b> <b>Drive</b> (signed as just [...] "Disney World") runs north as a limited-access highway into the Walt Disney World Resort and an electric pylon in the shape of Mickey Mouse can be seen on the southwest corner of the intersection. The single GreeneWay/World Drive exit (Exit 62) also marks an abrupt change from rural to suburban/urban landscape. The highway passes beside Celebration and Kissimmee on the east side and Walt Disney World Resort (not visible) on the west side.|$|E

50|$|Initially, {{the track}} location, which was {{adjacent}} to the Magic Kingdom parking lot, was seen to be convenient. However, {{after a couple of}} years, traffic control on race days became overwhelming. Because race spectators would arrive {{at the same time and}} place as regular Magic Kingdom theme park guests, overflow parking was required. In 1996-1997, Disney officials reacted by parking all race spectators in the Magic Kingdom parking lot, and diverting all Magic Kingdom guests to the Epcot parking lot. Race spectators would walk to the nearby Speedway, while all guests to the Magic Kingdom were required to take the monorail or a bus from Epcot to the Transportation and Ticket Center. There, they would transfer to a monorail on the Magic Kingdom loop, a somewhat circuitous trip which resulted in numerous guest complaints. In 1997, the IRL race was shortened by a sudden rainstorm, causing fans to hurry to their cars and resulting in severe traffic gridlock on <b>World</b> <b>Drive</b> and surrounding roads which lasted for several hours.|$|E
50|$|A Galactic Spectacular {{features}} multiple {{special effects}} including fireworks, projection mapping, fire effects, lasers, searchlights, and fog and smoke effects. The main aerial pyrotechnic shells are launched off-center {{from behind the}} Chinese Theater; appearing {{to the right of}} the theater as opposed to directly behind it. This differs from previous fireworks shows, as the current aerial shells are launched from across <b>World</b> <b>Drive,</b> instead of within the park's boundary as previously done. Low-level pyrotechnics are launched from the rooftops of the Great Movie Ride, Hyperion Theatre, ABC Commissary, Walt Disney: One Man's Dream, Voyage of the Little Mermaid, and Disney Junior - Live on Stage! buildings. Two flamethrowers situated adjacent to the theater's cupola release jets of isopar fire effects during the show. Fog machines hidden between the theater's spires create clouds of fog and smoke. Stage lighting surrounding the hub and concealed rope lights attached to the hub's trees provide additional lighting effects throughout the show. Imagery from all seven Star Wars saga films are projected onto the Chinese Theater facade of the Great Movie Ride. In addition to the Chinese Theater's surface, two blank projection facades flanking either side of the theater serve as additional areas of projection space.|$|E

50|$|The road {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with an entrance {{road to the}} Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge in Lake Buena Vista. For its westernmost 0.4 mi, it has many characteristics of an at-grade boulevard; however, east of the entrance to Disney's Animal Kingdom, it becomes a grade-separated expressway. Heading east, the parkway passes through several sections of the Disney World Complex before intersecting with <b>World</b> <b>Drive</b> and crossing into Osceola County. The parkway exits Walt Disney World, just before an interchange with Interstate 4. Although Osceola Parkway was built across Interstate 4 into Walt Disney World, an interchange with that freeway (Exit 65) did not open until 2001. The ramps with the exit to nearby SR 536 are interspersed such that traffic going on to I-4 from SR 536 cannot directly exit onto Osceola Parkway, and vice versa. The road then has an interchange with the Southern Connector, where the Parkway becomes a limited access toll road (although not a full expressway). The parkway passes through residential areas, passing through an interchange with Poinciana Blvd., featuring ramp tolls of $0.75 for eastbound exiting traffic and westbound entering traffic. East of the interchange, Osceola Parkway crosses the one mainline toll plaza just east of Shingle Creek, with a $1.75 toll as of April 2009.|$|E
5000|$|Lake Buena Vista Airport {{was built}} in 1971 {{to serve as a}} private STOL {{airfield}} for Walt Disney World guests and employees, with scheduled passenger service to Orlando Jetport at McCoy (now Orlando International Airport, MCO) and Tampa International Airport (TPA) provided by Shawnee Airlines, using de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft. This Shawnee Airlines service is mentioned in the [...] "Air Commuter Service" [...] section of the Sept. 9, 1972 Eastern Air Lines system timetable as a connecting service to and from Eastern flights at Orlando and Tampa. The airport was never large, with only enough space to accommodate four aircraft at a time; no hangar space was ever built. This STOL airfield was intended as a proof-of-concept for a planned, but was ultimately rejected in favor of a vision for a larger, full-service airport within Walt Disney World itself. All passenger service was discontinued by the 1980s, largely due to extensions of the Walt Disney World Monorail System on either side. As of 2009, flight operations are prohibited by a no-fly zone in place since 2003; however, the runway is fully intact and may be visible to motorists traveling along <b>World</b> <b>Drive</b> toward the Transportation and Ticket Center, as well as by passengers on the monorail.|$|E
