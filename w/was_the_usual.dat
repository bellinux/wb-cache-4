5|$|Historically, in-water {{recompression}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> {{method of}} treating decompression sickness in remote areas. Procedures were often informal {{and based on}} operator experience, and used air as the breathing gas as it {{was all that was}} available. The divers generally used standard diving gear, which was relatively safe for this procedure, as the diver was at low risk of drowning if he lost consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Of the ratings, 122 were Royal Marines.

5|$|After the First World War, another {{programme}} of {{improvements to}} the locks was carried out, extending the locks to , which enabled trains of 19 compartments to operate regularly. Experiments with trains as long as 38 tubs were carried out, but the difficulty of splitting the train {{to pass through the}} locks meant that 19 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> maximum. The compartments continued until the late 1960s to carry around half a million tons of coal, long after most British canals had ceased to be used for commercial traffic, but the gradual demise of the coal industry led to compartment traffic ceasing in 1986.|$|E

Groves came fourth in his class, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

5|$|The {{holding up}} {{of one hand}} with middle and index fingers crossed <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> gesture found in New Zealand in 1999–2001. The T-shape was also used when saying {{time-out}}. The time-out gesture is made with two hands - one hand held horizontally, palm down, the other hand vertically with the fingertips touching {{the bottom of the}} horizontal hand. In the US, although the more modern time-out has largely supplanted traditional terms, often accompanied by the time-out gesture, the crossed fingers gesture remains common.|$|E

5|$|Semaphore signals {{were used}} on the very first railway lines, but only a bare minimum were {{provided}} as the time interval system being relied upon instead. The first interlocking of signals to protect trains was provided in 1874, as before this time conflicting moves could be made. The design of the signals also progressed, with the disc type siding signals first introduced in 1885, and the lower quadrant somersault type main line signals adopted in 1887, {{both of which are}} still in use today. Green was not adopted as the All Right colour until 1898, with white being used before this time. Red <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> colour of all signal arms, until yellow was chosen as the colour for distant signals in 1926, with full adoption made in 1930. Colour light signals first appeared in 1918, and by 1924 they were the standard for new installations.|$|E

Rather than waiting until spring, as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>usual</b> practice, construction began and continued through that winter.|$|E
25|$|Technology {{was one of}} the {{important}} facets of Mongolian warfare. For instance, siege machines were an important part of Genghis Khan's warfare, especially in attacking fortified cities.

Instead the Mongol horde would travel with skilled engineers who would build siege engines from materials on site.|$|E

In the letter, Salcedo stated that the treasury only had 35,000 pesos. The Spanish in the archipelago were tired of the many rebellions in North Luzon, and the soldiers have not received any pay.|$|E
