30|$|The {{incidence}} of de-escalation of antifungal treatment {{in our study}} {{is in line with}} that reported recently by Bailly et al. (22 %) [26]. In another recent retrospective study performed in 262 critically ill patients receiving empirical or targeted antifungal treatment, the {{incidence of}} de-escalation was lower at 10 % [29]. Azoulay et al. performed a large multicenter cross-sectional one-day study to determine the incidence of ICU patients <b>without</b> <b>documented</b> antifungal infection who receive antifungals. Antifungal treatment was used in 154 (7.5 %) of study patients, including 100 (65 %) patients <b>without</b> <b>documented</b> fungal infection. These results suggest that de-escalation of antifungal treatment could probably be performed in a larger proportion of critically ill patients.|$|R
