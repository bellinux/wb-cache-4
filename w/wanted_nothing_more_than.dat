5|$|Edgardo {{was visited}} {{by his father}} several times under the {{supervision}} of the rector of the Catechumens, Enrico Sarra, from mid-August to mid-September 1858. The wildly divergent accounts of what happened during these encounters grew into two rival narratives of the entire case. Momolo's version of events, favoured by the Jewish community and other backers, was that a family had been destroyed by the government's religious fanaticism, that helpless Edgardo had spent the journey to Rome crying for his parents, and that the boy <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> to return home. The narrative favoured by the Church and its supporters, and propagated in the Catholic press throughout Europe, was one of divinely ordained, soul-stirring redemption, and a child endowed with spiritual strength far beyond his years—the neophyte Edgardo had faced a life of error followed by eternal damnation but now stood to share in Christian salvation, and was distraught that his parents would not convert with him.|$|E
25|$|Organized league cricket in the State {{began in}} Madras in 1932.The Indian Cricket Federation staged {{what is now}} {{acknowledged}} as the first cricket league in India when it conducted a competition for the clubs of Madras in 1932.The ICF and Madras Cricket Club often assumed adversarial positions and even conducted important matches independently on the same days, creating confusion and chaos among the armatures who <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a day’s entertainment. In time, however, good sense prevailed and the two rival bodies joined hands to form the Madras Cricket Association. (The romance of Tamil Nadu cricket-V.Ramanarayanan 2006).|$|E

2500|$|Cortés had to {{put down}} {{internal}} struggles among the Spanish troops as well. [...] The remaining Spanish soldiers were somewhat divided; many <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> to go home, {{or at the very}} least to return to Vera Cruz and wait for reinforcements. [...] Cortés hurriedly quashed this faction, determined to finish what he had started. [...] Not only had he staked everything he had or could borrow on this enterprise, he had completely compromised himself by defying his superior Velázquez. He knew that in defeat he would be considered a traitor to Spain, but that in success he would be its hero. So he argued, cajoled, bullied and coerced his troops, and they began preparing for the siege of Mexico. In this Cortés showed skill at exploiting the divisions within and between the Aztec states while hiding those of his own troops.|$|E

60|$|A playful mood {{would often}} follow the testy humor. The plunge of a three-pound fish, the slap-dash {{of a dozen}} smaller ones would startle you into nervous casting. But again {{you might as well}} spare your efforts, which only served to acquaint the trout with the best frauds in your fly book. They would rush at Hackle or Coachman or Silver Doctor, swirl under it, jump over it, but never take it in. They played with {{floating}} leaves; their wonderful eyes caught the shadow of a passing mosquito across the silver mirror of their roof, and their broad tails flung them up to intercept it; but they <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> play or exercise, and they would not touch your flies.|$|E

60|$|Since in this topsy-turvy world often {{things work}} by contraries, oddly enough no harm came to Godfrey from these fierce excitements. Indeed he slept {{better than he}} had done since he found his mind again, and awoke, still weak of course, but without any {{temperature}} or pains in his head. Now it was that there began the most blissful period of all his life. Isobel, when she had recovered her balance, made him understand {{that he was a}} patient, and that exciting talk or acts must be avoided. He on his part fell in with her wishes, and indeed was well content to do so. For a while he <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just to lie there and watch her moving {{in and out of his}} room, with his food or flowers, or whatever it might be, for a burst of bad weather prevented him from going out of doors. Then, as he strengthened she began to talk to him (which Mrs. Parsons did long before that event), telling him all that for years he had longed to know; no, not all, but some things. Among other matters she described to him the details of her father's end, which occurred in a very characteristic fashion.|$|E
60|$|This was, indeed, just as I {{would have}} it, for I <b>wanted</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> to have {{something}} offered, which I might give them back again; for I ever thought, and have found it by experience, {{to be the best}} way; and men were always secured in their duty by a generous kindness, better than by absolute dominion and severity: indeed, my opinion was justified in all the measures I took with these men; for as I found they were sufficiently humbled, and that I had brought them low enough, I let them know that it was not their punishment but their amendment I desired; that I scorned to make a prey of them, and take that forfeiture they had offered, by putting the wages due to them for their labour in my pocket. I then sent them word I was very glad to hear that they were sensible how much they had been imposed upon; that, as it was not my design to offer anything to them which they or any honest men ought to refuse, so it was not my desire to make any advantages of their follies but what might tend to bring them back to their duty; that, as I had no prospect that was inconsistent with their safety and interest, so I scorned to make an advantage of their submission; that as to their wages, though they had forfeited them by their mutiny, yet God forbid I should convert them to my own profit; and since forgiving their offence was in my power, the crime being in one particular an offence against me, they should never be able to say I made a gain of their submission, and, like the Pope, should sell them my pardon; that, upon their solemnly engaging to me never to offer the least disturbance of any kind in the ship for the future, but to do their duty faithfully and cheerfully, I would forget all that was passed; only this I expected, that two of them, who were particularly guilty of threatening the life of Captain Merlotte, should be punished as they deserved.|$|E
