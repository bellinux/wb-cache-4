Page, Jr. as a high-wing, twin-engine, cargo transport aircraft, utilizing plywood construction with a tricycle undercarriage. Though the British de Havilland Mosquito had successfully employed a ply construction using a balsa <b>wood</b> <b>core</b> and birch hardwood exterior, Curtiss-Wright engineers, using research provided by Forest Products Laboratory, rejected this approach, insisting instead on a ply construction of dense mahogany, which greatly increased the plane's weight. At Curtiss' request, Army Materiel Command laid in large supplies of mahogany, {{and a number of}} furniture manufacturers, including the Baldwin Piano Company, were subcontracted to build components for the aircraft, which would be assembled at Curtiss-Wright's new defense plant in Louisville, Kentucky.|$|E

40|$|The lack of {{consistent}} success of biological control of soilborne plant pathogen's {{may be due}} to the introduction of the organism into a foreign environment. We hypothesized that <b>wood</b> chip-polyacrylamide (PAM) <b>cores</b> surrounding host plant roots could alter the soil environment to favour growth of introduced biocontrol microorganisms, thereby reducing Verticillium dahliae infection of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) in a greenhouse. A 7 cm diameter x 15 cm deep hole (core) was drilled in the center of a 20 x 30 cm deep pot (1. 9 kg) containing soil infested with V. dahliae inoculum. Cores were then filled with wood chip-PAM-biocontrol organism mixtures.
