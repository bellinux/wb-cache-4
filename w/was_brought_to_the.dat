5|$|Cocker Spaniels were {{originally}} bred as hunting {{dogs in the}} United Kingdom, with the term cocker deriving from their use to hunt the Eurasian woodcock. When the breed <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States, it was bred to a different standard, which enabled it to specialize in hunting the American woodcock. Further physical changes were bred into the cocker in the United States during {{the early part of}} the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Henry's reign {{also saw}} {{the rise of the}} Guise brothers, Charles, who became a cardinal, and Henry's boyhood friend Francis, who became Duke of Guise. Their sister Mary of Guise had married James V of Scotland in 1538 and was the mother of Mary, Queen of Scots. At the age of five and a half, Mary <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> French court, where she was promised to the Dauphin, Francis.

5|$|In 2015 {{the legacy}} of the crew <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{forefront}} again when Ryan Goslings new movie 'Lost River' included Bill Aken's (aka Zane Ashton) 1961 hit record of 'He Was A Mean Dragon' as part of the film score. The record featured the early gathering of 'First Call' musician's including Ray Pohlman, Al Casey, Earl Palmer, etc. backing up their youngest member of the group. Glen Campbell volunteered to be the voice of 'The Dragon' {{on the end of the}} record and the interplay between Glen and Bill was hilarious.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{subsidence}} {{coupled with}} structural and political {{changes to the}} mining industry began the decline in Astley's industrial activities during the mid-20th century; its cotton mill closed in 1955, and the last coal <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface in 1970. However, Astley has grown {{as part of a}} commuter belt, supported by its proximity to Manchester city centre and inter-city transport links.

5|$|The {{history and}} {{economic}} growth of Minneapolis are tied to water, the city's defining physical characteristic, which <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> region during {{the last ice age}} ten thousand years ago. Ice blocks deposited in valleys by retreating glaciers created the lakes of Minneapolis. Fed by a receding glacier and Lake Agassiz, torrents of water from a glacial river cut the Mississippi riverbed and created the river's only waterfall, Saint Anthony Falls, important to the early settlers of Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|When Bågenholm {{was pulled}} out of the water, her pupils were dilated, her blood was not circulating, and she was not breathing. Falkenberg and Næsheim, both doctors, began giving her {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (CPR). The rescue helicopter soon arrived and Bågenholm <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tromsø University Hospital in an hour. The helicopter emergency team continued to give her CPR during the flight, and she was ventilated with oxygen. She was also treated with a defibrillator, but to no effect.|$|E
5|$|As Sukarno did {{not want}} Soegijapranata buried in the Netherlands, his body was flown to Indonesia after last rites were {{performed}} by Cardinal Bernardus Johannes Alfrink. Soegijapranata was declared a National Hero of Indonesia on 26July 1963, through Presidential Decree No. 152/1963, while his body was still in transit. Soegijapranata's body arrived at Kemayoran Airport in Jakarta on 28July and <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jakarta Cathedral for further rites, including a speech by Sukarno, presided by Bishop of Jakarta Adrianus Djajasepoetra. The following day Soegijapranata's body was flown to Semarang, accompanied by several Church and government luminaries. He was buried at Giri Tunggal Heroes' Cemetery in a military funeral on 30July, after several further rites. Darmojuwono was appointed as the new archbishop in December 1963; he was consecrated on 6April 1964 by Archbishop Ottavio De Liva.|$|E

5|$|At 1200, Mott <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{position}} of L Company commander Captain George F. Sharra. Mott ordered Sharra to take command and organize a retreat. Sharra ordered his three platoons to withdraw. A battalion of North Korean soldiers began {{moving down the}} pass towards the American positions. Men of I Company were forced to withdraw through rice paddies south of the pass, being strafed by mortar and machine gun fire in the process. They also had to cross a -wide stream in the retreat, and some drowned in the process. Most of the Americans were forced to discard weapons, equipment and clothing in the retreat. Many of the men of L Company, {{as well as some}} of the wounded, were able to evacuate by truck.|$|E
5|$|Classical music <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States {{with some}} of the first colonists. European {{classical}} music is rooted in the traditions of European art, ecclesiastical and concert music. The central norms of this tradition developed between 1550 and 1825, centering on {{what is known as the}} common practice period. Many American classical composers attempted to work entirely within European models until late in the 19th century. When Antonín Dvořák, a prominent Czech composer, visited the United States from 1892 to 1895, he iterated the idea that American classical music needed its own models instead of imitating European composers; he helped to inspire subsequent composers to make a distinctly American style of classical music. By the beginning of the 20th century, many American composers were incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from jazz and blues to Native American music.|$|E
5|$|Co-Freemasonry <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English-{{speaking}} {{world by}} the socialist and theosophist Annie Besant. Passing through the usual three degrees of craft masonry in 1902, she founded the Lodge of Human Duty No. 6 in London that same year. French-speaking lodges started {{to appear in the}} United States in 1903, but it was again Besant who opened the first English speaking lodge, in 1908. The French lodges took their lead from the Grand Orient de France in not requiring any religious belief in their members. Besant, with the blessing of Paris, followed the lead of the United Grand Lodge of England in requiring initiates to believe in a supreme being. Craft degrees in English speaking lodges took on a less continental, and more mystical flavour, with Besant importing the Dharma, or Besant Leadbeater ritual to both Britain and the United States.|$|E

The specimen is missing its head and tail, although {{the rest of the}} skeleton is mostly intact. Although it was once exhibited at the Maxberg Museum in Solnhofen, it is currently missing. It belonged to Eduard Opitsch, who loaned it to the museum until 1974. After his death in 1991, it {{was discovered}} that the specimen was missing and may have been stolen or sold.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Francisco Layna Serrano {{of nearby}} Ruguilla {{had for years}} tried to save the monastery but had failed to {{interest}} {{the government in the}} expensive preservation proposal. Realizing that this was his last chance to document the place as its stones were being removed, he wrote a monograph of its history and included a site plan of the layout of buildings, written from memory. As a result of his efforts, on June 3, 1931, Santa María de Óvila was listed as a National Monument of Spain, or Bien de Interés Cultural (Cultural Property). Layna Serrano published his monograph in 1932. In 1933, the monastery's historic cartulary <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> University of Madrid and published; the original was archived at the University of Oviedo.|$|E
5|$|During the 14th and 15th centuries, a {{large number}} of these works were {{imported}} into northern Europe, and were widely copied by the first generation of Netherlandish artists, among others. The iconography of both the late Byzantine – typified by the unknown artist responsible for the Cambrai Madonna – and 14th-century successors such as Giotto favoured presenting the Madonna on a monumental scale. Undoubtedly van Eyck absorbed these influences, though when and through which works is disputed. It is believed that he had first-hand exposure to them during his visit to Italy, which occurred either in 1426 or 1428, before the Cambrai icon <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> North. Van Eyck's two Madonna panels carried forward the habit of reproduction and were themselves frequently copied by commercial workshops throughout the 15th century.|$|E

5|$|Harvey Milk's {{political}} career centered on making government responsive to individuals, gay liberation, {{and the importance}} of neighborhoods to the city. At the onset of each campaign, an issue was added to Milk's public political philosophy. His 1973 campaign focused on the first point, that as a small business owner in San Francisco—a city dominated by large corporations that had been courted by municipal government—his interests were being overlooked because he was not represented by a large financial institution. Although he did not hide {{the fact that he was}} gay, it did not become an issue until his race for the California State Assembly in 1976. It <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fore in the supervisor race against Rick Stokes, as it was an extension of his ideas of individual freedom.|$|E
5|$|Hotham and Osborn {{discussed}} {{the situation and}} determined to destroy the wreck to deny it to the French. To this end, three cutters were gathered and a boarding party under Lieutenant Edward Grey sent in to attack Preneuse at 20:00. This party came under fire from the batteries but was able to successfully access the battered French frigate at 21:00, finding that only the officers {{and a handful of}} sailors remained, the others having been given the opportunity to escape to the shore in boats rather than become prisoners of war. Among the captives was Lhermitte, who was permitted to bring his personal baggage with him before he <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British squadron as a prisoner. Grey then set the wrecked ship alight before returning to Adamant, having executed his orders without losing a single man.|$|E
5|$|Ian McCormick diagnoses the {{pamphlet}} as representing a gradual change in European {{discourse on the}} character of the sodomite: previous publications had discussed sexual deviance (conceived in contemporary terms) as a general evil; with Satan's Harvest Home a new attention <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> individual character of persons who committed sodomy. He argues that 'before the seventeenth century, sodomy was not even precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves, heretics, sorcerers, and the like. Increasingly, however, it came to be linked with pride, excess of diet, idleness, and contempt of the poor.' The pamphlet's equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period.|$|E
