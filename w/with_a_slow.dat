5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} episode, Wirt and Greg wake up in a hospital, with Greg telling a story but being cut off before we can hear what it's about. As the scene ends, Greg's frog begins to glow, due to having eaten a magic bell in The Unknown, {{suggesting}} that there was at least some physical aspect to the story. The series ends <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> montage of how Wirt and Greg affected the inhabitants of the Unknown.|$|E
5|$|The final {{assault on}} Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops {{attacked}} the south gate {{while the other}} contingents attacked the northern wall. Initially the Provençals at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall fared better, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> but steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched {{at both ends of}} the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured. In the ensuing panic, the defenders abandoned the walls of the city at both ends, allowing the Crusaders to finally enter.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} melody in {{this movement}} (E) {{is taken from}} an old Hussar song, for which Prokofiev provided an optional baritone part. The melody first appears in a slow and somewhat dissonant statement, after which the pace quickens: sleigh bells, rapid pizzicato strings, and piano combine {{to give the impression}} of a fast winter's journey by means of the troika, a traditional Russian three-horse sled. The ride is accompanied at regular intervals by the song theme, which brings the movement to its close <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> repetition of its final phrase.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} single was re-recorded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> tempo {{for inclusion}} on Jebediah's debut album, Slightly Odway.|$|R
25|$|Respiratory muscles. Initially {{this results}} in rapid, shallow {{breathing}} <b>with</b> <b>an</b> inability to cough. In advanced stages it is associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> exaggerated breathing pattern.|$|R
5|$|Kurt Harland {{composed}} most of {{the music}} for Soul Reaver; Jim Hedges handled the remaining audio. Harland remarked that, under Amy Hennig's direction, he programmed music to change based on the current gameplay situation—for example, combat or swimming. This variation was accomplished through a custom Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) driver, which altered music based on signals from the game engine. Each vampire tribe had corresponding music; one tribe of vampires was associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow,</b> thumping theme to {{convey a sense of}} working machinery. To further fit the music to the environment, the sound team consulted level designers regarding layout and appearance. Music from both Soul Reaver and Soul Reaver 2 was released on a promotional soundtrack in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis, {{often called}} polio or {{infantile}} paralysis, is an infectious disease {{caused by the}} poliovirus. In about 0.5 percent of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move. This can occur over {{a few hours to}} a few days. The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2 to 5 percent of children and 15 to 30 percent of adults die. Another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to 5 percent have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs. These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms. Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection.|$|E
5|$|These are {{species of}} craggy mountainous habitats, {{although}} all three will also frequent human habitation. The African rock martin {{and the south}} Asian dusky crag martin are resident, but the Eurasian crag martin is a partial migrant; birds breeding in southern Europe are largely resident, but some northern breeders and most Asian birds are migratory, wintering in north Africa or India. They do not normally form large breeding colonies, but are more gregarious outside the breeding season. These martins build neat mud nests under cliff overhangs or in crevices in their mountain homes, and have readily adapted to the artificial cliffs provided by buildings and motorway bridges. Up to five eggs, white with dark blotches at the wider end, may be laid, and a second clutch is common. Ptyonoprogne martins feed mainly on insects caught in flight, and patrol cliffs near the breeding site <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> hunting flight as they seek their prey. They may be hunted by falcons and infected with mites and fleas, but their large ranges and populations mean {{that none of the}} crag martins are considered to be threatened, and all are classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
50|$|DJ Too Tuff {{currently}} {{owns and}} operates DangerZone Music Group, a Philadelphia based independent record label <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slew</b> of artists and upcoming releases.|$|R
5000|$|The song's music shares some {{similarities}} with Elton John's rhythm {{structure for}} [...] "I'm Still Standing", although <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> beat and lower pitch.|$|R
5000|$|Humulin N (human NPH insulin {{injection}} origin) is <b>an</b> intermediate-acting insulin <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> {{onset of}} action and a longer duration of activity than Humulin R.|$|R
25|$|Augmentation is {{the process}} of facilitating further labour. Oxytocin has been used to {{increase}} the rate of vaginal delivery in those <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> progress of labour.|$|E
25|$|The 'Princes' {{themselves}} were {{not known for}} their manoeuvrability; heavy and blocky, when forced to keep pace <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> convoy {{and in order to}} maintain steerage, the ships often ran with the leeward shaft at twice the speed of the other. Despite these extreme conditions, there were surprisingly few mishaps.|$|E
25|$|The vocal quartet Los Zafiros {{was another}} {{successful}} {{group from the}} beginning of the sixties. Founded in 1961, it was influenced by the Doo-Wop style of The Platters, The Diamonds and other American groups, and counted on a repertoire consisting of ballads, calypsos and bossanovas, as well as songs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> rock ad bolero rhythms.|$|E
2500|$|One such revelation {{was made}} to Gunatitanand Swami’s mother, Sakarba. Swaminarayan arrived at Mulji’s house along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slew</b> of {{prominent}} devotees including Vashrambhai, Dosabhai and Ratnabhai.|$|R

50|$|The song {{originally}} {{appeared on}} the 1996 independent album MMMBop <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> tempo, but was reworked as an upbeat pop track by hit producers The Dust Brothers.|$|R
25|$|Flies at {{tree-top}} level, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow,</b> drifting, unpredictable flight akin {{to that of}} {{the tree}} nymph (Idea lynceus). The butterflies transparent greyish underside makes it difficult to distinguish in the shadows. During rain, it sits on leaves with the forewings drooped over the hindwings, concealing its bright upper colouration. The butterfly has a habit of hill-topping and visits flowers of diverse species.|$|E
25|$|The Artois Hound {{is a rare}} {{breed of}} dog, and a {{descendant}} of the Bloodhound. A scent hound 22-23inches high at the withers, weighing anything between 55 and 65 pounds, it is a well constructed dog <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> graceful gait. It has a large, strong head, a medium-length back and a pointed tail that tends to be long and sickle-shaped. Their ears are set at eye level; they have large prominent eyes and quite thick lips.|$|E
25|$|It is an intermediate-acting {{benzodiazepine}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> {{onset of}} action, {{so it is}} usually prescribed to individuals who have trouble staying asleep, rather than falling asleep. It is commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders with associated tension, irritability, and agitation. It is also prescribed for drug and alcohol withdrawal, and for anxiety associated with depression. Physicians may use oxazepam outside its approved indications to treat social phobia, post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia, premenstrual syndrome, and other conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Billboard {{described}} the song as [...] "summery and sexual, catchy and laid-back." [...] The song {{is composed of}} smooth tropical vibes and synth-based melody <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slowed</b> tempo.|$|R
50|$|If {{two or more}} runners {{finish the}} race with {{the same number of}} laps {{completed}} the competitor <b>with</b> <b>a</b> faster last lap wins over the competitor <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> last lap.|$|R
30|$|Medium-scale {{concentric}} waves <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> {{propagation velocity}} (138 – 423 m/s) and less dissipation propagated in a radial direction following the large-scale waves after 06 : 15 UT.|$|R
25|$|Although A-weighting <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> rms detector, as {{commonly}} used in sound level meters is frequently used when measuring noise in audio circuits, a different weighting curve, ITU-R 468 weighting uses a psophometric weighting curve and a quasi-peak detector. This method, formerly known as CCIR weighting, is preferred by the telecommunications industry, broadcasters, and some equipment manufacturers as it reflects more accurately the audibility of pops and short bursts of random noise as opposed to pure tones. Psophometric weighting is used in telephony and telecommunications where narrow-band circuits are common.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{activity}} {{appears to}} be related to the age and rotation rate of main-sequence stars. Young stars with a rapid rate of rotation exhibit strong activity. By contrast middle-aged, Sun-like stars <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> rate of rotation show low levels of activity that varies in cycles. Some older stars display almost no activity, which may mean they have entered a lull that is comparable to the Sun's Maunder minimum. Measurements of the time variation in stellar activity can be useful for determining the differential rotation rates of a star.|$|E
25|$|When news broke of {{the death}} of Space Ghost Coast to Coast voice actor and {{animator}} C. Martin Croker, who died on September 18, 2016, the network paid tribute to him by playing the first Coast to Coast episode in his memory that night. They also played a bump in his memory that talked about his work for Adult Swim, and then his name, year of birth, and year of death, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> fade in and fade out, like bumps for other deaths. This bump was 30 seconds, while most regular bumps are half of that time.|$|E
5000|$|The American folk {{group the}} Sandpipers did {{a cover of}} the song in 1966 in Spanish <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> tempo that peaked at #30 on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|R

5000|$|... 4 and 8 Foot Tube-Slides - {{these were}} both slides that ran downhill. The four foot slide was <b>a</b> {{narrower}} slide <b>with</b> <b>a</b> faster current, the eight foot slide was <b>a</b> wider slide <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> current.|$|R
25|$|Active {{systems are}} {{designed}} for three-dimensional noise cancellation. To implement an active system, low-noise fluxgate magnetometers are mounted {{at the center of}} each surface and oriented orthogonally to it. This negatively feeds a DC amplifier through a low-pass network <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> falloff to minimize positive feedback and oscillation. Built into the system are shaking and degaussing wires. Shaking wires increase the magnetic permeability, while the permanent degaussing wires are applied to all surfaces of the inner main layer to degauss the surfaces. Moreover, noise cancellation algorithms can reduce both low-frequency and high-frequency noise. Modern systems have a noise floor of around 2–3fT/Hz0.5 above 1Hz.|$|E
25|$|An extra {{half-hour of}} play was allowed, {{as a result}} was nearing, but Warne and Clarke defied the English. Warne was lucky {{on more than one}} occasion, playing streaky shots that could easily have got him out, but he did smash Giles for 12 in one over. He was not out {{overnight}} – however, Steve Harmison, bowling his third spell of the day, brought the third day's proceedings to an end <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> delivery that was not read correctly by Clarke, who missed the ball completely to be bowled. England now only needed two wickets on the fourth day – Australia, however, needed 107 runs for the victory.|$|E
25|$|Billy Murdoch won the toss for Australia {{and chose}} to bat first. The {{decision}} proved a poor one though, as Australia were easily skittled {{out for a}} meagre 63 in 80 overs, taking just over 2 hours. The captain himself tried to offer resistance <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> defensive 13, and experienced wicket-keeper/batsman Jack Blackham top-scored with 17, but the only other batsman to reach double-figures was Tom Garrett with 10. Inspired bowling from opening bowler Ted Peate who took 4 for 31, and Dick Barlow who produced a devastating 5 for 19, ripped the Australian batting order apart on a greenish wicket that gave more assistance that it first seemed.|$|E
5000|$|DNA {{oxidation}} and caloric restriction: Caloric restriction reduces 8-OH-dG DNA {{damage in}} organs of ageing rats and mice. Thus, reduction of oxidative DNA damage is associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> rate of ageing and increased lifespan.|$|R
50|$|A {{version of}} the song <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> tempo is heard in the 1998 film Dark City, sung by Anita Kelsey. In the Director's Cut {{version of the}} film the song is sung by Jennifer Connelly.|$|R
