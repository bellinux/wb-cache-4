Czerkas' Cryptovolans <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> as Microraptor, and his Scansoriopteryx <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> as Epidendrosaurus. Czerkas described Omnivoropteryx, noting {{that it was}} similar to Sapeornis. Later specimens of Sapeornis with skulls demonstrated that the two were probably synonymous.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{travelled}} from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, {{accompanied by}} a large group including family members and followers. During the trip, he <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> with respect in the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, he <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> as a government guest. Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited {{him to come to}} Constantinople, is unclear. The reason may have been political because Bahá'u'lláh was viewed as a person of influence. After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for Adrianople. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It may have been due to pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with Bahá'u'lláh's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the great}} success of the Troilus, the love story was popular as a free {{standing}} tale to be retold by English-language writers throughout the 15th and 16th centuries and into the 17th century.

5|$|Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt {{reduction}} of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal. Rebound symptoms are {{the return of the}} symptoms for which the patient <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> but worse than before. Withdrawal symptoms are the new symptoms that occur when the benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of physical dependence.|$|E

50|$|Density {{functional}} theory {{seeks to}} solve for an approximate {{form of the}} electronic density of a system. In general, atoms are split into ionic cores and valence electrons.

Thus, for example, a Lithium atom <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> as two bodies - Li+ and e- - while oxygen <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> as three bodies, namely O2+ and 2e−.|$|R
