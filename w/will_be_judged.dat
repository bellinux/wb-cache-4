As he is dragged through the crowd, Ned notices Arya on the statue, and alerts the Night's Watch recruiter Yoren to her location. With Sansa, Cersei, Joffrey and the Small Council looking over him, Ned confesses to treason and swears fealty to Joffrey in front of the crowd. Satisfied, Sansa and Cersei ask Joffrey to spare Ned as Joffrey promised, but Joffrey breaks his promise and orders Ned to be executed. As Sansa watches in horror, Cersei, Varys and the Small Council attempt to intervene, and Arya tries to rescue Ned, only to be stopped by Yoren, who prevents her from seeing her father's execution.

25|$|Islam {{integrated}} {{the concept}} of Jinn from pre-Islamic animism, but reduced {{the status of the}} former divine Jinn to mortals and created entities, who share the earth along with humans and <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> on judgement Day by the only one God. Accordingly, the society of Jinn resembles that of humans, and are believed to procreate, eat, sleep, die and practise religion. Due to their similarities with humans, several narrations hold, that humans and Jinn may have sexual interactions and some legal book even deal with conditions of a marriage between these different beings. Nevertheless, Islam forbids interaction with Jinn. The Jinn may also cause possession and harm humans, but Jinn attacks are considered as an result of their own intention instead of evil nature, although an individual Jinni maybe evil, but then because of its own decision. The Jinn live either in an intermediary realm, between the divine world and the physical plane, like the Greek Daemon and ancient Rome Genii or roaming earth invisible to humans eye.|$|E

500|$|Catholic {{theology}} sees conscience as {{the last}} practical [...] "judgment of reason which at the appropriate moment enjoins [...] to do good and to avoid evil". The Second Vatican Council (1962-65) describes: [...] "Deep within his conscience man discovers a law which he has not laid upon himself but which he must obey. Its voice, ever calling him to love and {{to do what is}} good and to avoid evil, tells him inwardly at the right movement: do this, shun that. For man has in his heart a law inscribed by God. His dignity lies in observing this law, and by it he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>judged.</b> His conscience is man’s most secret core, and his sanctuary. There he is alone with God whose voice echoes in his depths." [...] Thus, conscience is not like the will, nor a habit like prudence, but [...] "the interior space in which we can listen to and hear the truth, the good, the voice of God. It is the inner place of our relationship with Him, who speaks to our heart and helps us to discern, to understand the path we ought to take, and once the decision is made, to move forward, to remain faithful" [...] In terms of logic, conscience can be viewed as the practical conclusion of a moral syllogism whose major premise is an objective norm and whose minor premise is a particular case or situation to which the norm is applied. Thus, Catholics are taught to carefully educate themselves as to revealed norms and norms derived therefrom, so as to form a correct conscience. [...] Catholics are also to examine their conscience daily and with special care before confession. Catholic teaching holds that, [...] "Man has the right to act according to his conscience and in freedom so as personally to make moral decisions. He must not be forced to act contrary to his conscience. Nor must he be prevented from acting according to his conscience, especially in religious matters". This right of conscience does not allow one to arbitrarily disagree with Church teaching and claim that one is acting in accordance with conscience. [...] A sincere conscience presumes one is diligently seeking moral truth from authentic sources, that is, seeking to conform oneself to that moral truth by listening to the authority established by Christ to teach it. Nevertheless, despite one's best effort, [...] "t can happen that moral conscience remains in ignorance and makes erroneous judgments about acts to be performed or already committed... This ignorance can often be imputed to personal responsibility... In such cases, the person is culpable for the wrong he commits." [...] Some Catholics appeal to conscience in order to justify dissent, not on the level of conscience properly understood, but on the level of the principles and norms which are supposed to inform conscience. [...] For example, some priests make {{on the use of the}} so-called internal forum solution (which is not sanctioned by the Magisterium) to justify actions or lifestyles incompatible with Church teaching, such as Christ's prohibition of remarriage after divorce or sexual activity outside marriage. The Catholic Church has warned that [...] "rejection of the Church's authority and her teaching... can be at the source of errors in judgment in moral conduct".|$|E
