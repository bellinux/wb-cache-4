40|$|This study {{relates to}} the {{application}} of mineral <b>wastes</b> <b>and</b> by-products on cultivated land. Since there is a critical lack of data on mineral <b>wastes</b> <b>and</b> by-products used for application on cultivated land regarding type, amount and composition {{the objectives of the}} study are as follows: identification of <b>wastes</b> <b>and</b> by-products applied on cultivated land, assessment of quantities of the identified wastes/by-products and of the amounts applied on cultivated land, collection of information regarding material properties of such <b>wastes</b> <b>and</b> by-products and establishment of a data base. The study shows that at present at least 3 mil. tons of mineral <b>wastes</b> <b>and</b> by-products are applied on cultivated land. Particularly <b>wastes</b> <b>and</b> by-products are employed which are resulting from sugar processing (calcium carbonate sludge), water supply (dredging spoil), exploration of quarry (fractions of minor quality, mineral powder), chemical industry (ammonium sulphate, various limy residues), treatment of water for industrial use (sludge from decarbonation) and iron and steel production (blast furnace cinder and converter slug). In view of detrimental effects of substances as applied on cultivated land substantial efforts for legal regulations are required. (orig.)

5|$|Sea anemones {{have what}} can be {{described}} as an incomplete gut; the gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach and possesses a single opening to the outside, which operates as both a mouth and anus. <b>Waste</b> <b>and</b> undigested matter is excreted through this opening. The mouth is typically slit-like in shape, and bears a groove at one or both ends. The groove, termed a siphonophore, is ciliated, and helps to move food particles inwards and circulate water through the gastrovascular cavity.|$|E
