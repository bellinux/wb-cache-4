25|$|Former All My Children {{writer and}} {{producer}} Ginger Smith returned {{as the new}} executive producer and creator Agnes Nixon served as consultant. The new episodes were 30 minutes long and aired on Hulu, Hulu Plus, and iTunes. Initially, 220 episodes of the show were ordered.

The show schedule was {{four days a week}} (Monday-Thursday) with a Friday recap show, MORE All My Children, to feature behind the scenes footage as well as interviews with the cast and to be hosted by Leslie Miller. The revival show began on April 29, 2013, and production began on February 25, 2013, in Connecticut, <b>with</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children and One Life to Live taping in five-week rotations for 17 weeks.|$|E

It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{eventual}} hit game Family Feud ran against As The World Turns from July 12, 1976, until April 22, 1977, {{it did not}} become a hit for ABC until its move to the mornings. Only when ABC made its first move to a one-hour soap <b>with</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children did trouble really began for As the World Turns (and Days of our Lives), since ABC kept that serial's starting time at 1:00/noon, meaning that fans of that serial who tuned to NBC or CBS would miss {{the last half of}} that day's storyline (or, contrariwise, would not, if they watched until the mid-program commercial break and then changed channels, pick up the As The World Turns or Days of Our Lives activities from the episode's beginning, since ABC strategically placed its break several minutes after the bottom of the hour). Further, All My Children's emphasis on youth-oriented, sexier story lines provided a sharp contrast to the domestic, almost quaint tone of As the World Turns (and to a lesser degree, the melodramatic, somewhat topical Days). On January 16, 1978, ABC ballooned its decade-old One Life to Live to the 2:00 PM/1:00 PM starting time, compounding the other networks' headaches. These factors helped contribute to the fall of As The World Turns from the top spot in the ratings {{at the end of the}} 1978-79 season. After finishing the previous season tied with Another World for number one in the Nielsens, As the World Turns fell to fourth behind All My Children, General Hospital, and The Young and the Restless.|$|E

He wrote in 1939, [...] "That I love Cumberland <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> heart and soul is another reason for my pleasure in writing these Herries books.

When re-recording songs for Irreemplazable, Beyoncé's vocal coach provided the Spanish lyrics phonetically, and each line was recorded up to four times for the EP. Beyoncé has stated that she intends to take up Spanish lessons in the future. She said of the EP's recording, [...] "This is such an honor {{for me to be}} able to connect <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> fans. I had so much fun singing in Spanish.
