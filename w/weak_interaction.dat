5|$|The <b>weak</b> <b>{{interact}}ion</b> affects all the fermions of the Standard Model, {{as well as}} the Higgs boson; neutrinos interact through {{gravity and}} the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction</b> only, and neutrinos were the original reason for the name weak force. The <b>weak</b> <b>interaction</b> does not produce bound states (nor does it involve binding energy) – something that gravity does on an astronomical scale, that the electromagnetic force does at the atomic level, and that the strong nuclear force does inside nuclei.|$|E
5|$|In {{particle}} physics, the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction</b> (the {{weak force}} or weak nuclear force) is {{the mechanism of}} interaction between sub-atomic particles that causes radioactive decay and thus plays {{an essential role in}} nuclear fission. The theory of the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction</b> is sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics (QFD), in analogy with the terms quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dealing with the strong interaction and quantum electrodynamics (QED) dealing with the electromagnetic force. However, the term QFD is rarely used because the weak force is best understood in terms of electro-weak theory (EWT).|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction</b> {{was once}} {{described}} by Fermi's theory, {{the discovery of}} parity violation and renormalization theory suggested that a new approach was needed. In 1957, Robert Marshak and George Sudarshan and, somewhat later, Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann proposed a V−A (vector minus axial vector or left-handed) Lagrangian for weak interactions. In this theory, the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction</b> acts only on left-handed particles (and right-handed antiparticles). Since the mirror reflection of a left-handed particle is right-handed, this explains the maximal violation of parity. Interestingly, the V−A theory was developed before {{the discovery of the}} Z boson, so it did not include the right-handed fields that enter in the neutral current interaction.|$|E
40|$|We {{summarize}} the present status of testing {{the standard model}} of parity nonconservation in neutral atoms, emphasizing the success in understanding the semileptonic <b>weak</b> <b>interactions.</b> There is good agreement for the nuclear spin independent contributions, especially in cesium. There is some evidence of nuclear spin dependent terms, probably due to hadronic <b>weak</b> <b>interactions.</b> There {{is no evidence of}} leptonic <b>weak</b> <b>interactions.</b> The lessons learned from atomic physics are discussed, together with strategies for parity experiments using highly charged ions...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{studies have}} shown that, in real ecosystems, species-interaction {{strengths}} are generally skewed in their distribution towards <b>weak</b> <b>interactions.</b> Some theoretical work also suggests that <b>weak</b> <b>interactions,</b> especially in omnivorous links, are important for the local stability of a community at equilibrium. However, the majority of theoretical studies use uniform distributions of interaction strengths to generate artificial communities for study. We investigate {{the effects of the}} underlying interaction-strength distribution upon the return time, permanence and feasibility of simple Lotka-Volterra equilibrium communities. We show that a skew towards <b>weak</b> <b>interactions</b> promotes local and global stability only when omnivory is present. It is found that skewed interaction strengths are an emergent property of stable omnivorous communities, and that this skew towards <b>weak</b> <b>interactions</b> creates a dynamic constraint maintaining omnivory. Omnivory is more likely to occur when omnivorous interactions are skewed towards <b>weak</b> <b>interactions.</b> However, a skew towards <b>weak</b> <b>interactions</b> increases the return time to equilibrium, delays the recovery of ecosystems and hence decreases the stability of a community. When no skew is imposed, the set of stable omnivorous communities shows an emergent distribution of skewed interaction strengths. Our results apply to both local and global concepts of stability and are robust to the definition of a feasible community. These results are discussed in the light of empirical data and other theoretical studies, in conjunction with their broader implications for community assembly...|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the large}} masses of the W bosons, {{particle}} transformations or decays (e.g., flavour change) that depend on the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction</b> typically occur much more slowly than transformations or decays that depend only on the strong or electromagnetic forces. For example, a neutral pion decays electromagnetically, and so has a life of only about 10−16seconds. In contrast, a charged pion can only decay through the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction,</b> and so lives about 10−8seconds, or a hundred million times longer than a neutral pion. A particularly extreme example is the weak-force decay of a free neutron, which takes about 15minutes.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{is better}} {{described}} as a non-contact force field having a finite range, albeit very short. In 1968, Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg unified the electromagnetic force and the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction</b> by showing them to be two aspects of a single force, now termed the electro-weak force.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Enrico Fermi {{proposed}} the first {{theory of the}} <b>weak</b> <b>interaction,</b> known as Fermi's interaction. He suggested that beta decay {{could be explained by}} a four-fermion interaction, involving a contact force with no range.|$|E

5|$|Lee and Yang's {{research}} into existing experimental results convinced them that parity was conserved for electromagnetic interactions {{and for the}} strong interaction. For this reason, scientists had expected that {{it would also be}} true for the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction,</b> but it had not been tested, and Lee and Yang's theoretical studies showed that it might not hold true for the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction.</b> Lee and Yang worked out a pencil-and-paper design of an experiment for testing conservation of parity in the laboratory. Lee then turned to Wu for her expertise in choosing and then working out the hardware manufacture, set-up, and laboratory procedures for carrying out this experiment.|$|E
5|$|The laws {{of nature}} were long thought to remain the same under mirror reflection. The results of an {{experiment}} viewed via a mirror {{were expected to be}} identical to the results of a mirror-reflected copy of the experimental apparatus. This so-called law of parity conservation was known to be respected by classical gravitation, electromagnetism and the strong interaction; it was assumed to be a universal law. However, in the mid-1950s Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee suggested that the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction</b> might violate this law. Chien Shiung Wu and collaborators in 1957 discovered that the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction</b> violates parity, earning Yang and Lee the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E

5|$|Having {{electric}} charge, mass, color charge, and flavor, quarks are {{the only}} known elementary particles that engage in all four fundamental interactions of contemporary physics: electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and <b>weak</b> <b>interaction.</b> Gravitation is too weak to be relevant to individual particle interactions except at extremes of energy (Planck energy) and distance scales (Planck distance). However, since no successful quantum theory of gravity exists, gravitation is not described by the Standard Model.|$|E
5|$|Quarks have various {{intrinsic}} properties, including electric charge, mass, color charge, and spin.

40|$|In {{the article}} {{considers}} some remarks {{to the standard}} approach to <b>weak</b> <b>interactions.</b> Higgs mechanism contains contradictions, therefore cannot {{be considered as a}} realistic mechanism for mass generations. The couple constant of the <b>weak</b> <b>interactions</b> cannot be changed in dependence on momenta transfer (it leads to violation of the law of energy-momenta conversation), i. e. it must be constant. It means that there are no charge vacuum polarizations or renormalization of the couple constant of the <b>weak</b> <b>interactions.</b> Then {{it is clear that the}} resonance enhancement of neutrino oscillations in matter cannot exist either for absence of matter polarizations. Masses are not generated and connected states cannot form in these interactions either since $P$-parity is violated. Then also as in the strong and electromagnetic <b>interactions,</b> in the <b>weak</b> <b>interactions</b> we can use the perturbative theory but in this case the propagators must be the propagators of free particles without renormalization.

40|$|The three {{theoretical}} and historical {{components of the}} Standard Model are the exact chiral gauge theory of <b>weak</b> <b>interactions,</b> electroweak unification, and the Higgs mechanism for spontaneous symmetry breaking. I put into historical perspective my 1958 invention of the first gauge theory of <b>weak</b> <b>interactions,</b> predicting <b>weak</b> neutral currents, and show how the fundamental differences between global and gauge symmetries and between partial flavour and exact gauge symmetries, emerged in the strong and <b>weak</b> <b>interactions.</b> Although renormalizability is necessary for theoretical consistency, electroweak unification was not necessary, in principle. An interesting difference appears between the sin 2 θW = 0 limit of the electroweak theory and the original SU(2) W gauge theory of <b>weak</b> <b>interactions.</b> While the electroweak mixing angle might have had any value (including zero), historically the value sin 2 θW ∼ 0. 3 actually observed in weak neutral currents gave circumstantial support for the Standard Model and stimulated the search for W − and Z−mesons. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{less than}} a year, {{extensions}} to the Gell-Mann–Zweig model were proposed. Sheldon Lee Glashow and James Bjorken predicted {{the existence of a}} fourth flavor of quark, which they called charm. The addition was proposed because it allowed for a better description of the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction</b> (the mechanism that allows quarks to decay), equalized the number of known quarks with the number of known leptons, and implied a mass formula that correctly reproduced the masses of the known mesons.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction,</b> fermions can {{exchange}} three distinct types of force carriers known as the W+, W−, and Z bosons. The mass of each of these bosons is far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which is consistent with the short range of the weak force. The force is in fact termed weak because its field strength over a given distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the strong nuclear force or electromagnetic force.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem had}} already been solved by Pontecorvo in 1968. In 1959, a {{powerful}} accelerator (that was never built) was being designed, and he began considering experiments that could be performed with it. He contemplated a project investigating muons. Julian Schwinger had hypothesised that particles experience the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction</b> through exchanging W bosons. The W boson would not be discovered until 1983, but a problem immediately surfaced. Gerald Feinberg pointed out that this implied that some interactions {{that had never been}} observed should occur, but conceded that this was only true if the neutrinos associated with electrons were the same as those associated with muons.|$|E

5|$|With Murray Gell-Mann, Feynman {{developed}} {{a model of}} weak decay, which showed that the current coupling in the process {{is a combination of}} vector and axial currents (an example of weak decay is the decay of a neutron into an electron, a proton, and an antineutrino). Although E. C. George Sudarshan and Robert Marshak developed the theory nearly simultaneously, Feynman's collaboration with Murray Gell-Mann was seen as seminal because the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction</b> was neatly described by the vector and axial currents. It thus combined the 1933 beta decay theory of Enrico Fermi with an explanation of parity violation.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this theory}} allowed a {{compound}} symmetry CP to be conserved. CP combines parity P (switching left to right) with charge conjugation C (switching particles with antiparticles). Physicists were again surprised when in 1964, James Cronin and Val Fitch provided clear evidence in kaon decays that CP symmetry could be broken too, winning them the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1973, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa showed that CP violation in the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction</b> required {{more than two}} generations of particles, effectively predicting {{the existence of a}} then unknown third generation. This discovery earned them half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics. Unlike parity violation, CP violation occurs in {{only a small number of}} instances, but remains widely held as an answer to the difference between the amount of matter and antimatter in the universe; it thus forms one of Andrei Sakharov's three conditions for baryogenesis.|$|E
5|$|In the {{prevailing}} Standard Model of physics, the photon {{is one of}} four gauge bosons in the electroweak interaction; the other three are denoted W+, W− and Z0 and are responsible for the <b>weak</b> <b>interaction.</b> Unlike the photon, these gauge bosons have mass, owing to a mechanism that breaks their SU(2) gauge symmetry. The unification of the photon with W and Z gauge bosons in the electroweak interaction was accomplished by Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg, for which they were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in physics. Physicists continue to hypothesize grand unified theories that connect these four gauge bosons with the eight gluon gauge bosons of quantum chromodynamics; however, key predictions of these theories, such as proton decay, have not been observed experimentally.|$|E

50|$|Because the <b>weak</b> <b>interactions</b> violate parity, {{collider}} {{processes that}} can involve the <b>weak</b> <b>interactions</b> typically exhibit asymmetries in the distributions of the final-state particles.
