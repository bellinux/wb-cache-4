Based on the {{propagation}} law of partially coherent beams, the analytical {{expression of the}} beam <b>width,</b> <b>waist</b> positions and the far-field divergence angle of partially coherent sinh-Gaussian (ShG) beams through an astigmatic lens were derived. The effect of astigmatism and spatial coherence parameter on the beam parameters was mainly analyzed. It is found that the beam width depends on the astigmatic coefficient, spatial coherence parameter, decentered parameter, fresnel number and propagation distance in general. The astigmatism results in {{a difference between the}} beam <b>widths,</b> <b>waist</b> positions and far-field divergence angles in the x and y directions...|$|R

In this work, the optical spectra and near-field distribution of a gold nanocrescent array were investigated both experimentally and theoretically. To find out the LSPR wavelength and the enhancement using different morphologies of sharp tips, the spectra of gold nanocrescent arrays with different <b>waist</b> <b>widths</b> (d) were first measured, which were then confirmed and analyzed using the finite difference time-domain method and the hybridization theory. At last, the LSPR of this array with 100 nm diameter dielectric nanodisks was studied for sensing in subwavelength areas. Our results showed that because of its giant nanoantenna-enhanced electromagnetic field at the two tips, this gold nanocrescent array could be a suitable local senor to sense the variation of a local medium in a subwavelength area.

50|$|Beam {{quality is}} {{important}} in many applications. In fiber-optic communications beams with an M2 close to 1 are required for coupling to single-mode optical fiber. Laser machine shops care {{a lot about the}} M2 parameter of their lasers because the beams will focus to an area that is M4 times larger than that of a Gaussian beam with the same wavelength and D4σ <b>waist</b> <b>width</b> before focusing; in other words, the fluence scales as 1/M4. The general rule of thumb is that M2 increases as the laser power increases. It is difficult to obtain excellent beam quality and high average power (100 W to kWs) due to thermal lensing in the laser gain medium.|$|E
40|$|A new bipedal walking {{model has}} been {{proposed}} and the walking motion of the {{model has been}} analyzed. The model has a <b>waist</b> <b>width</b> and hence provides more realistic information of the human gait than the old model does. The model consists of two masses located at a waist region and rigid links corresponding to the thighs, low legs, and feet, jointed by pins together with torsional springs. Difference from the old model is the following : Two hip joints are separated for a <b>waist</b> <b>width</b> and {{are connected to the}} femoral region of each leg with torsional springs. The old model has no <b>waist</b> <b>width</b> and hence that walking motion is restricted on one vertical plane. On this new model, however, the walking motion is allowed in two vertical planes. Therefore, the waist swings sinusoidally in a holizontal plane during walking. In almost investigations of a human walking, it seems that attention is focused on the method of optimum control of the driving force or torque in order to attain a normal gait. In this investigation, on the other hand, driving force is only a waist swing which is not controlled.

PDD {{is a serious}} problem for the population of Spix’s macaws (Cyanopsitta spixii) at Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation (AWWP), Doha, Qatar. During their annual health checks, radiographs are taken in accordance with the official health programme guidelines for the species. Radiograph image measurements of proventriculus diameter, hourglass <b>waist,</b> liver <b>width</b> and keel height enable calculation of the proventriculus diameter-tokeel height ratio which might be a useful indicator of a birds PDD status. In addition, the change in these values from 2004 to 2007 was evaluated. From the measurements of proventriculus width, we did observe a trend of increased large proventricular diameters in positive birds, lower in birds suspicious for PDD and lowest in birds with no obvious PDD lesions, as diagnosed by crop biopsy. Proventriculus diameter-to-keel height ratio did not differ significantly between positive and non positive birds (classified by crop biopsy), but reflected a similar trend to proventriculus width. Therefore, radiographic proventricular diameter measurements might be a useful initial indicator for carrying out crop biopsies in birds to detect PDD. From January 2007 to September 2007, there was a significant decrease of proventriculus diameter, hourglass <b>waist</b> and liver <b>width</b> that was interpreted as an effect of significant dietary changes instigated in 2005 and further refined in 2007...|$|R

The x-and y-components of the linear momentum density are composed of two lobes with the equivalent area and the opposite sign. Therefore, the overall x- and y-components of the linear momentum in an arbitrary reference plane are equal to zero.

The specific measurement of critical material properties {{has been done to}} develop the manufacturing and design of these components.

Thus, there are three objectives being highlighted in order to solve this problem. The problem to calibrate the strain rate calculation had been created by using MATLAB meanwhile camera. Next, the implementation of image correlation between MATLAB and camera and strain rate of sheet metal was analyze in tensile test. The objectives above was achieved by implementing the vision system to obtained deformation image. Therefore, the strain rate measurements are more accurate by using vision system method. However, the camera calibrator application shows the camera parameter used in this experiment. MATLAB software are new type of implementation to calculate the strain rate when the images were started to deform. In conclusion, vision system is able to provide logical and useful displacement.

40|$|Recently alpine skis {{with a wider}} <b>waist</b> <b>width,</b> which medially {{shifts the}} contact between the ski edge and the snow while turning, have {{appeared}} on the market. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the knee joint kinematics during turning while using skis of different waist widths (65 mm, 88 mm, 110 mm). Six highly skilled skiers performed ten turns on a predefined course (similar to a giant slalom course). The relation of femur and tibia in the sagital, frontal and coronal planes was captured by using an inertial motion capture suit, and Global Navigation Satellite System was used to determine the skiers’ trajectories. With respect of the outer ski the knee joint flexion, internal rotation and abduction significantly decreased with the increase of the ski <b>waist</b> <b>width</b> for the greatest part of the ski turn. The greatest abduction with the narrow ski and the greatest external rotation (lowest internal rotation) with the wide ski are probably the reflection of two different strategies of coping the biomechanical requirements in the ski turn. These changes in knee kinematics were most probably due to an active adaptation of the skier to the changed biomechanical conditions using wider skis. The results indicated that using skis with large waist widths on hard, frozen surfaces could bring the knee joint unfavorably closer to the end of the range of motion in transversal and frontal planes as well as potentially increasing the risk of degenerative knee injuries...|$|E

A lowWHR (i. e. a curvaceous body) is believed to correspond to the optimal fat distribution for high fertility, and so this shape should be highly attractive. In this paper we present evidence that weight scaled for height (the body mass index (BMI)) is the primary determinant of sexual attractiveness rather thanWHR. BMI is also strongly linked to health and reproductive potential. Furthermore, we show how covariation of apparent BMI andWHR in previous studies led to the overesti-mation of the importance of WHR in the perception of female attractiveness. Finally, we show how visual cues, such as the perimeter^area ratio (PAR), can provide an accurate and reliable index of an individual's BMI and could be used by an observer to di¡erentiate between potential partners...|$|R

Data about family background, personal information, anthropometric parameters, hematological and biochemical examination were obtained. Result: Weight, shoulder <b>width,</b> <b>waist</b> circumference, hip circumference, mid upper arm circumference of patients for CABG were similar to those of normal while fat fold at triceps and biceps were significantly higher. However, values obtained from VS patients were significantly lower (P< 0. 5).

A methodology is described which deals with the magnitude of change from one year to the next in the means of each of the dress features. The velocity of the fashion process is found to be not accelerating in women’s formal evening dress but rather is highly variable and episodic. What does exhibit a significant increase through time is the within-year variance of the variables. Sweeping technological, political, and economic trans-formations have taken place in Western civilization in the past 200 years. Few would question that these changes have occurred at an ever faster pace. Fashion in women’s dress is a social process which has demonstrated considerable stylis-tic change in the past two centuries as well. But has this change been speeding up...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether runners displayed {{any of the}} abnormalities characteristic of patients with anorexia nervosa, we conducted a cross sectional study of 31 high mileage, 18 low mileage runners and 18 non-running controls. Subjects completed a personal data questionnaire, the Jackson Personality Inventory (JPI) and the Eating Attitudes Questionnaire (EAT), underwent a body image test and a blood sample was obtained for measurement of reproductive, thyroid and adrenal hormones. High mileage runners scored significantly higher infrequency scores on the JPI than sedentary controls {{but there was no}} evidence of psychopathology. The high mileage runners also significantly overestimated <b>waist</b> <b>width</b> and there were small but statistically significant differences in EAT scores between controls and the runner groups. Ten of 49 runners had EAT scores beyond two standard deviations above the mean of non-running controls. Serum total, free and non-specifically bound testosterone and prolactin levels were significantly lower in high mileage runners than controls. LH, FSH, cortisol and thyroid hormones were not significantly different. There were no significant differences in any hormone between low mileage runners and controls. displayed no clear abnormalities characteristic of patients with anorexia The results suggested that running may have a chronic effect on serum testosterone and prolactin levels in high mileage but not low mileage runners. Although there was no significant evidence of anorexia nervosa on testing the runners with EAT, the overestimation of waist size provided some evidence of a distortion of body image in the high mileage runners. Runners displayed no clear abnormalities characteristic of patients with anorexia nervosa...|$|E
40|$|As one of {{the main}} {{breeding}} selection criteria, external appearance has special economic importance in the hog industry. In this study, an Illumina Porcine SNP 60 BeadChip was used to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 605 pigs of the F 2 generation derived from a Large White × Minzhu intercross. Traits under study were abdominal circumference (AC), body height (BH), body length (BL), cannon bone circumference (CBC), chest depth (CD), chest width (CW), rump circumference (RC), rump width (RW), scapula width (SW), and <b>waist</b> <b>width</b> (WW). A total of 138 SNPs (the most significant being MARC 0033464) on chromosome 7 were found to be associated with BH, BL, CBC, and RC (P-value=  4. 15 E- 6). One SNP on chromosome 1 was found to be associated with CD at genome-wide significance levels. The percentage phenotypic variance of these significant SNPs ranged from 0. 1 - 25. 48 %. Moreover, a conditional analysis revealed that the significant SNPs were derived from a single quantitative trait locus (QTL) and indicated additional chromosome-wide significant association for 25 SNPs on SSC 4 (BL, CBC) and 9 SNPs on SSC 7 (RC). Linkage analysis revealed two complete linkage disequilibrium haplotype blocks that contained seven and four SNPs, respectively. In block 1, the most significant SNP, MARC 0033464, was present. Annotations from pig reference genome suggested six genes (GRM 4, HMGA 1, NUDT 3, RPS 10, SPDEF and PACSIN 1) in block 1 (495 kb), and one gene (SCUBE 3) in block 3 (124 kb). Functional analysis indicated that HMGA 1 and SCUBE 3 genes are the potential genes controlling BH, BL, and RC in pigs, with an application in breeding programs. We screened several candidate intervals and genes based on SNP location and gene function, and predicted their function using bioinformatics analyses...|$|E
