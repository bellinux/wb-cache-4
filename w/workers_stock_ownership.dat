40|$|We {{test the}} {{relation}} between ambiguity aversion and five household portfolio choice puzzles: nonparticipation in equities, low allocations to equity, home-bias, own-company <b>stock</b> <b>ownership,</b> and portfolio under-diversification. In a representative US household survey, we measure ambiguity preferences using custom-designed questions based on Ellsberg urns. As theory predicts, ambiguity aversion is negatively associated with stock market participation, the fraction of financial assets in stocks, and foreign <b>stock</b> <b>ownership,</b> but it is positively related to own-company <b>stock</b> <b>ownership.</b> Conditional on <b>stock</b> <b>ownership,</b> ambiguity aversion is related to portfolio under-diversification, and during the financial crisis, ambiguity-averse respondents {{were more likely to}} sell stocks...|$|R

I exploit these changes in managerial <b>stock</b> <b>ownership</b> to examine the relation between managerial ownership and manager-shareholder incentive alignment. In contrast to prior work that suggests equity incentives induce opportunistic managerial behavior, I find earnings management declines following the adoption of mandatory <b>stock</b> <b>ownership</b> plans relative to a propensity-matched control sample. I also posit and find a reduction in bid-ask spreads following plan adoptions, consistent with manager-shareholder incentive alignment improving market liquidity and decreasing information asymmetry.

40|$|The {{idea that}} profit sharing {{increases}} employment {{has been widely}} tested, but the theoretical basis for the claim is weak and the empirical results are ambiguous. This paper shows that employee <b>stock</b> <b>ownership</b> based on individually-held stakes avoids the problems of traditional profit sharing. Employee <b>stock</b> <b>ownership</b> shifts employment to the efficient level by either raising employment from an initial state of underemployment or decreasing it from an initial state of overemployment. Since the effect on employment is not unidirectional, empirical tests need to differentiate between traditional profit sharing and employee <b>stock</b> <b>ownership</b> and to condition on the initial state of employment. profit sharing; employee ownership; ESOPs; collective bargaining...|$|R

40|$|We {{find that}} higher <b>stock</b> <b>ownership</b> rates {{are linked to}} an upward shift in the Republican share of the House popular vote since the late 1980 s, {{consistent}} with theories that property interests affect voting. To proxy for discontinuous <b>stock</b> <b>ownership</b> rates, we use equity mutual fund costs, which have fallen, are negatively correlated with <b>stock</b> <b>ownership</b> rates and the Republican vote share in the long run, and help explain short-run changes along with midterm elections, economic conditions, and presidential popularity. Findings suggest that the major parties' shares of the House popular vote will fluctuate around 50 % until other factors trigger a political realignment.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between employee <b>stock</b> <b>ownership</b> {{and the cost of}} capital, the main determinant of shareholder value creation computed through economic value added (EVA). By reducing agency conflicts within the firm, we hypothesize that employee share ownership reduces the firm's cost of capital by affecting its two components, i. e. the cost of equity and the cost of debt. We test this hypothesis in France, a leading country in terms of employee ownership, based on a panel of the 120 largest listed companies for the 2000 - 2011 period. We find: (i) no significant relationship between employee <b>stock</b> <b>ownership</b> and the cost of equity; (ii) a negative curvilinear relationship between employee <b>stock</b> <b>ownership</b> and the cost of debt; (ii) a negative curvilinear relationship relationship between employee <b>stock</b> <b>ownership</b> and the weighted average cost of capital. These results suggest debtholders regard ESO as positive as long it is moderate because it shifts risk from them to employees and that this effect is still perceptible in the weighted average cost of capital...|$|R
40|$|Despite of its {{importance}} for the economy, <b>stock</b> <b>ownership</b> by households is poorly under-stood. Recent research has uncovered that expectations of stock market returns by individuals strongly correlate with <b>stock</b> <b>ownership.</b> This paper reports new 8 ̆ 5 ndings from a survey which contains novel data on stock-market return expectations, individual information sets and <b>stock</b> <b>ownership,</b> for a representative sample by age and wealth (Mode de vie des Français, TNS 2007). Individual information sets measure in probabilistic terms the beliefs that individuals hold about equity returns over the 8 ̆ 5 ve {{years prior to the}} time of the survey (March 2007). We nd that (i) expected returns and information sets are very heterogeneous, hump-shaped in age, higher for males and increasing in wealth; (ii) <b>stock</b> <b>ownership</b> increases with the subjective con-ditional expectation of a positive return; and (iii) that information is costly acquired, sourced from social interactions, professionals, specialised media access, or own past experience, and is consistent with rational inattention amongst optimists and income constrained respondents...|$|R
