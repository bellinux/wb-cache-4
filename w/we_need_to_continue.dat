30|$|Though {{the family}} {{engagement}} literature frequently {{refers to the}} importance of a relationship-based approach, it does not describe the ideal ethical and political parameters of the interpersonal exchange. I develop care dialogues as a framework, grounded in the non-ideal circumstances of everyday practices, and propose them for everyday use in early childhood and care settings. This manuscript constitutes an initial attempt to frame the concept and consider how they might be used. Next steps should address specific practice and policy opportunities to operationalize and integrate them. Opportunities that are less affected by political vacillations—such as QRIS standards—would be preferred over those that rely on compatible ideology of state or federal administration. One might claim that the fields’ current emphasis on relational practices addresses the issues raised in this manuscript. However, referencing the image of a relationship without explicating how it is assembled socially provides insufficient practice and policy guidance. <b>To</b> <b>continue</b> aligning practice and policy with the values of so-called “relational practice”, <b>we</b> will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> clarifying disparate articulations of relating.|$|R

The stories of these women need to serve as an important intervention in conversations about anti-black state violence, rape culture, and the vulnerability of sex workers, ex-offenders, and current and recovering drug addicts to state and state-sanctioned violence.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we set out}} {{to study}} the genetic {{background}} of neuronal function that enables adaptive behaviours that are essential for survival, such as understanding the relations between actions and outcomes and forming accurate representations of the environment. In the experimental protocols we used, exploratory and cue-response behaviour were motivated by sweet rewards, mimicking real-life situations in which we form memories of environments and action-outcome series associated with rewards. We demonstrated that operant learning and extinction consist of multiple stages that are dissociable, heritable and regulated by different chromosomal areas, characterized the performance of common laboratory mouse lines in acquisition and extinction tasks and suggested mouse models for perseverative disorders. We dissected the role of Arc/Arg 3. 1 in neuronal processes that take place during active exploration of environment and subsequent sleep. We found that Arc/Arg 3. 1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited attenuated hippocampal oscillatory activity in the high frequency range and disrupted synchronized firing during track running. Furthermore, we showed that Arc/Arg 3. 1 KO mice had decreased hippocampal sharp wave-ripple activity and that correlated firing activity during sleep was diminished. These alterations may explain why Arc/Arg 3. 1 mice are impaired spatial learning and lack memory consolidation. Together, these findings paint an intriguing picture of the genetic background and neuronal processes involved in complex behaviours that are crucial for survival. In order to further understand and unravel this intricate linkage, <b>we</b> will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> study the triad of genes, neuronal networks and behaviour from all its corners...|$|R
