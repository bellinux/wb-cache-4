5000|$|After {{the main}} {{friction}} zone, some car washes have a dedicated care zone. Prior to entering the care zone, {{the car is}} rinsed with fresh water. This is immediately followed {{by a series of}} extra services. In many car washes, the first of these services is a polish <b>wax.</b> <b>Polish</b> waxes fill in microscopic imperfections in the vehicle's clear coat, thus improving shine. After the polish wax application is typically a retractable mitter or top brush and, in some cases, side brushes or wrap-around brushes. Next is a protectant, which creates a thin protective film over a vehicle's surface. Protectants generally repel water, which assists in drying the car and aiding in the driver's ability to see through their windshield during rain. A low-end wax or clear coat protectant follows the main protectant. A drying agent is typically applied {{at the end of the}} tunnel to assist in removing water from the vehicle's surface prior to forced air drying.

[...] Varndean School for Girls, named after a nearby farm and situated in the Withdean area, opened in 1926. Soon afterwards he designed a boys' school on the same site. Varndean School for Boys was designed in the Neo-Georgian style around two quadrangles; Simpson started work in 1929, and the school opened in 1931. The schools have since merged and are known as Varndean School. Between these two commissions, he designed a building in nearby Portslade which later became the town hall. The Ronuk Hall and Welfare Institute on Victoria Road (1928) served two purposes: it was a social club and multi-purpose hall for workers at the nearby Ronuk <b>wax</b> <b>polish</b> factory, {{and it was a}} memorial to Robert Chignall, a director of the company.

The paper describes a robotic cell for finishing {{operations in}} a custom shoe production plant. Such customization of shoe production should allow production of small batches of shoes of the same type. This requires automatic set up and adaptation of the production line. To meet these requirements, a CAD system for automatic generation, optimization and validation of motion trajectories was integrated into a robotic cell. In automatic trajectory generation some of the major problems are limitations posed by the robot joint limits, robot singularities and environment obstacles.

40|$|Extraction of high-value {{products}} from agro-industrial waste {{is an important}} component {{for the development of a}} sustainable bioeconomy. In this work, natural wax extraction was carried out on different types of sugarcane waste (rind, leaf and bagasse) using supercritical CO 2 (scCO(2)). Substantial quantities of long-chain aldehydes and n-policosanols (nutraceutical compounds) were found in the rind (83 % of total composition). Interestingly, the wax obtained from the leaf residues varied from other types of waxes from sugarcane waste, with low aldehyde and n-policosanol contents (normally found in high quantities) and considerable amounts of high-value triterpenoids (169 +/- 6 mg/g wax), which have well-known medicinal properties. The use of sugarcane leaf residues for the extraction of waxes has not been previously considered, though the amount of these residues increased significantly after the switch to green harvesting. Sugarcane bagasse wax showed the highest ester composition (37 +/- 1. 5 mg/g of wax), which can be useful in a host of applications, ranging from cosmetics to hard <b>wax</b> <b>polishes,</b> lubricants, coatings and plasticisers.

40|$|Piper hispidinervium C. DC (Piperaceae) is {{popularly known}} as long pepper. It grows in {{degraded}} areas of natural fields {{in the state of}} Acre, Brazil. Its leaves are 3 to 4 % essential oil rich in safrole, within the range of 90 to 94 %. In the chemical industry, safrole is an important raw material, mainly due to two of its derivatives: heliotropin, which is widely used as a fragrance and flavoring agent, and piperonyl butoxide (PBO), a vital ingredient of pyrethroid insecticides. Natural pyrethrum in particular would not be an economical insecticide without the synergistic effect of PBO; therefore, its industrial future is linked to the continued availability of PBO. As a fragrance, safrole has many applications in household products such as floor <b>waxes,</b> <b>polishes,</b> soaps, detergents and cleaning agents. In this work, leaves were dried in a fixed-bed dryer using different drying-air temperatures (35, 40, 45, 50, 55 and 60 ºC) and drying times (900, 2700 and 3600 seconds). Essential oil was extracted by cohobation (meaning that the condensed water that comes out of the flask is recycled) from both raw and dried leaves. The essential oil yield and safrole content are susceptible to rapid loss of moisture by Piper hispidinervium C. DC leaves. It was observed that the essential oil yield increased twice after the drying process.
