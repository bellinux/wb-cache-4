The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) provides a unique cognitive-aesthetic domain of learning through drama, public speaking, debate, puppetry and creative Chinese lyrical composition, to strengthen self-expression and nurtures aesthetics appreciation in students, as well as to allow them to learn and embrace cultural diversity.|$|E
5|$|Davos Seaworth confronts Melisandre about Shireen's death. Melisandre {{admits to}} burning Shireen alive, but {{points out that}} she did it for the Lord of Light. Davos rebuts by saying that Stannis was {{defeated}} anyway and that Melisandre's actions were all for naught, forcing her {{to admit that she}} was wrong. Davos requests permission from Jon Snow to execute Melisandre, but she counters that she <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in the coming war against the White Walkers. Jon exiles Melisandre from the North and threatens to execute her if she ever returns. Later, Jon and Sansa Stark discuss who will lead the united Stark forces, with each deferring to the other.|$|E

In fact in this act Nan/Zoe is now played by the actress who played the real Zoe in Act 1. However she still has the same humorous flaws, movements and habits. She has also been programmed to respond to certain trigger words using phrases and actions which Jerome anticipates <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> – but comedy results from the unexpected use of the trigger words in normal conversation.|$|E

25|$|The MBBS course {{starts with}} the basic pre and para-clinical {{subjects}} such as biochemistry, physiology, anatomy, microbiology, pathology and pharmacology. The students simultaneously obtain hands-on training in the wards and out-patient departments, where they interact with real patients for five long years. The curriculum aims to inculcate standard protocols of history taking, examination, differential diagnosis and Complete patient Management. The student is taught to determine what investigations <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> for a patient {{and what are the}} best treatment options. The curriculum also contains a thorough practical knowledge and practice of performing standard clinical procedures. The course also contains a 12-month-long internship, in which an intern is rotated across various specialties. Besides standard clinical care, one also gets a thorough experience of ward management, staff management and thorough counselling skills.|$|E
500|$|Another {{important}} {{property of}} the quark–gluon plasma is that very high energy quarks moving through the plasma are stopped or [...] "quenched" [...] after traveling only a few femtometers. This phenomenon {{is characterized by a}} number [...] called the jet quenching parameter, which relates the energy loss of such a quark to the squared distance traveled through the plasma. Calculations based on the AdS/CFT correspondence have allowed theorists to estimate , and the results agree roughly with the measured value of this parameter, suggesting that the AdS/CFT correspondence <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> for developing a deeper understanding of this phenomenon.|$|E

NMR experiments {{can be made in}} magnetic fields with strengths up to 60 Tesla. [...] Higher magnetic fields can improve the quality of NMR measurement data. Quantum oscillations is another experimental method where high magnetic fields are used to study material properties such as the geometry of the Fermi surface.
