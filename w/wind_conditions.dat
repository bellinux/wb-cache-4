40|$|More than 80 {{percent of}} all {{electrical}} energy customers are electric motors. Therefore one of the prospects of resource-effective technologies in power industry is control of rotating electric equipment <b>condition.</b> <b>Winding</b> defects {{are one of the}} main causes of electric motor failures. Reliable control of <b>winding</b> <b>condition</b> is an urgent task of modern electrical engineering technology. The present article is devoted to the research of pulsed method application of transformer winding control for electric motor <b>winding</b> <b>condition</b> control. The procedure of <b>winding</b> <b>condition</b> control technology is described. The proposed method is based on the known pulsed method. The essential difference between the two methods is that only one probing impulse is used which is a probing impulse and response signal at once. The results of diagnostic procedure research at different winding defects are given. It is established that the place of winding damage corresponds to characteristic impulse changes. The defect of definite types causes specific changes of the probing impulse form. Therefore, different winding defects could be found with high accuracy along winding...|$|R
5|$|The {{cloud cover}} {{is such that}} typical surface light levels are similar to a partly cloudy day on Earth, around 5000–10000 lux. The {{equivalent}} visibility is about three kilometers, but this will likely vary with the <b>wind</b> <b>conditions.</b> Little to no solar energy could conceivably be collected by solar panels on a surface probe.

5|$|For the 2010 Ski Flying World Cup season, {{beginning}} in Oberstdorf, and from thereon used at all ski flying and ski jumping events, a supplementary points system was introduced. This system {{takes into account}} the wind speed and direction during each jump, as well as mid-round start gate adjustments, in order to enable a more fair contest. If a headwind is present, this is deemed an unfair advantage and points are therefore deducted as 'compensation'; if a tailwind is present, this is deemed to be a disadvantage and additional points are awarded instead. The amount of deduction or addition is calculated via coefficient using complex instrumentation which analyses the <b>wind</b> <b>conditions</b> at the time of a jump, and the value of the points themselves are in minimum increments of 0.1.|$|E
5|$|Hammerfest {{was served}} from 1935 by {{scheduled}} seaplanes at a water aerodrome at Rypefjord. Services were interrupted by World War II, but resumed in 1945, lasting until the 1963 opening of Alta Airport. Hammerfest Airport opened on 1 August 1974, along {{with four other}} regional airport in Finnmark and Troms, and was originally served with de Havilland Canada Twin Otters. The de Havilland Canada Dash 7 was introduced in 1983 and a helicopter base was established in 1989. The Dash 8 was introduced in 1995 and the airport was nationalized two years later. A Dash 8 was damaged beyond repair after a hard landing in 2005.

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of different air pollution dispersion models in <b>wind</b> calm <b>conditions.</b> The models have been applied to two case studies: the cities of Modena and Reggio Emilia, both placed in the Po river valley (Northern Italy), an area characterized by prevailing weak <b>winds</b> <b>conditions.</b> The emission sources are the municipal waste incinerator of Modena and the Turbo Gas plant of Reggio Emilia. Total suspended particulate (TSP) concentration levels are estimated by three models: the gaussian Industrial Source Complex (ISC 3) and WinDimula 3. 0 models, and the langrangian particle model SPRAY. The performances of the models have been compared: ISC 3 provides less reliable results, while SPRAY and WinDimula 3. 0 have shown a good capability to describe a domain characterized by <b>wind</b> calm <b>conditions</b> and SPRAY simulation performs significantly better {{in the vicinity of}} the source...|$|R

5|$|Near {{the top of}} the inrun, {{there is}} a 'start gate' – a metal or wooden beam – on which an athlete sits and awaits their signal to jump via a set of traffic lights (green, amber, and red). These lights are {{operated}} directly by Borek Sedlák. An athlete may enter the gate when amber is shown. If red is shown after this point, the <b>wind</b> <b>conditions</b> will have been deemed unfavourable for a safe jump: the athlete must then carefully exit the gate as they had entered it and await another opportunity to jump. Failure to dismount the gate within ten to fifteen seconds of being shown a red light, or jumping without having been given the signal to go, will disqualify the athlete.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} type of Mycenaean vessel based on depictions of {{contemporary}} art was the oared galley with long and narrow hulls. The shape of the hull was constructed in a way to maximize the number of rowers. Thus, a higher speed could have been achieved regardless of <b>wind</b> <b>conditions.</b> Although it carried mast and sail, it was less efficient as a sailing ship. The Mycenaean galley offered certain advantages. Although lighter compared to the oared-sailing ship of the Minoans of Crete, it seated more rowers. Its steering mechanism was a triangular steering oar, a forerunner of the latter steering oar of Archaic era.|$|E

40|$|Wintertime {{sea surface}} heat flux {{variability}} across the Kuroshio Extension (KE) front is analyzed using two surface flux buoys moored {{on the northern}} and the southern sides of the KE front {{as well as the}} observation by Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observation Satellite (AMSR-E). The combined use of the wind speed and the other AMSR-E products (the sea surface temperature and the integrated water vapor) provides the instantaneous latent heat flux at every observation cells. The coincident data used are from periods during two winters in 2007 and 2008, when the two surface buoys had a complete suite of meteorological data. In these two winter periods, we focus on three types of typical weather patterns referred to here as: the northerly <b>wind</b> <b>condition,</b> the monsoon <b>wind</b> <b>condition,</b> and the normal condition. The difference in the surface heat flux between these conditions is attributed to the different air mass transformation. We analyzed the spatial change of the boundary layer parameters and their influence on the surface heat flux between the two buoys. During the northerly <b>wind</b> <b>condition,</b> the satellite measurement captures the rapid increase of the surface water vapor content associated with the SST front because of the nonlinearity of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. It is found that the change is consistent with the large latent heat flux in spite of the weaker wind speed in the southern side of the SST front. 1...|$|R

5|$|The second {{aspect of}} the {{compensation}} system involves the start gate position. If the gate is changed at any point during a round after at least one athlete has jumped, then all subsequent athletes are individually penalised with a points deduction based on how many positions the gate was moved up, or awarded additional points for the gate being lowered. In variable <b>wind</b> <b>conditions</b> requiring either a higher or lower inrun speed than originally anticipated, {{it is not uncommon}} for many gate changes to be made as a round wears on. In the era prior to gate compensation, athletes who had jumped before a gate adjustment had to quickly make their way back up the hill to jump again, which was always logistically difficult to arrange due to time constraints.|$|E
5|$|The ship's Seafires flew 75 sorties on {{the first}} day of {{operations}} and 60 on 10 September, but the Seafire was not well suited to carrier landings in low <b>wind</b> <b>conditions</b> and many were damaged in landing accidents. 44 sorties were flown on 11 September and only 18 on 12 September, even though Unicorns mechanics had managed to repair ten Seafires over the previous night. The fighter shortage grew so acute during the operation that fighters from the carriers Illustrious and , intended to provide distant cover against an attempt by the Italian fleet to interfere with the invasion, staged forward to Unicorn in order to provide air cover over the landings. By 12 September, the situation had improved so that 887 Squadron was able to fly off six Seafires to a temporary airfield ashore.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical {{analyses}} {{show that}} detours that increase flight distance {{by up to}} 20% will often be adaptive on aerodynamic grounds – a bird that loads itself with food to cross a long barrier flies less efficiently. However some species show circuitous migratory routes that reflect historical range expansions and are far from optimal in ecological terms. An example is the migration of continental populations of Swainson's thrush Catharus ustulatus, which fly far east across North America before turning south via Florida to reach northern South America; this route {{is believed to be}} the consequence of a range expansion that occurred about 10,000 years ago. Detours may also be caused by differential <b>wind</b> <b>conditions,</b> predation risk, or other factors.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the wind assessment of high layer for siting the wind turbine on the complex terrain, {{which is based}} on the data measured by the use of Doppler SODAR. Although a rough estimation of the wind assessment using standard meteorological anemometers at low layer are cost effective and easy to be installed, it is necessary to measure the <b>wind</b> <b>condition</b> at hub height for accurate assessment. Comparison between measured data by Doppler SODAR and the data predicted from observation of the <b>wind</b> <b>condition</b> at low layer is performed. Large difference is seen in the measured wind profile and calculated power law plots of the wind. Estimation of generation power of wind turbine due to SODAR measurement agrees well with the actual turbine generation power.

The airport had {{the highest number of}} {{cancellations}} in the country, with 31 of 609 flights canceled in the first eleven months of operation. During some periods, regularity was as low as 50%. The navigational aids were moved in 1989 to increase safety, more runway lights were installed and an anemometer was installed on the mountain, costing NOK1 million. Widerøe introduced self-imposed restrictions on landing at Værøy from 31 October 1988. Aircraft were not allowed to land or take off if the wind came from 090°–240° (though south) if the wind speed exceeded , including gusts. Additional restriction were introduced following an incident on 18 January 1989. These were again modified on 1 November 1989.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{causes the}} {{generation}} of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause {{a low level of}} environmental noise. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain <b>wind</b> <b>conditions.</b> Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation openings, roof openings or cables.|$|E
5|$|The first {{proposals}} for an airport on Værøy were {{launched by the}} government in the late 1960s. A 1968 meteorological report concluded that the island was highly susceptible for strong winds, dominantly from the west, which could cause problems for air traffic. Three locations were considered: Kvalnes, Røssnesvågen og Nordlandet. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute concluded in 1973 that Nordlandet was the most suitable location in terms of weather, but test flights showed otherwise. Nordlandet was the cheapest alternative. Estimates showed that the regularity at an airport would be significantly lower than at the existing heliport. This caused local politicians to wish to keep the existing service, but pressure from Røst caused Værøy politicians to support an airport. After initial protests against Nordlandet as a site, Mayor Asmund Berg accepted the location on 3 May 1984. There had not been conducted sufficient test flights to establish the <b>wind</b> <b>conditions</b> above the airport caused by Teisthammeren, a mountain next to the airport. Widerøe was opposed to the location of the airport.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} market mechanism design for wind energy. We consider a dynamic two-step model with one strategic seller with wind generation and one buyer, who trade energy through a mechanism determined by a designer. The seller has private information about his technology and <b>wind</b> <b>condition,</b> which he learns dynamically over time. We consider (static) forward and real-time mechanisms that take place at time T= 1 and T= 2, respectively. We also propose a dynamic mechanism that provides a coupling between the outcomes of the forward and real-time markets. We show that the dynamic mechanism outperforms the forward and real-time mechanisms for a general objective of the designer. Therefore, we demonstrate the advantage of adopting dynamic market mechanisms over static market mechanisms for wind energy. The dynamic mechanism reveals information about wind generation in advance, and also provides flexibility for incorporation of new information arriving over time. We discuss how our results generalize to environments with many strategic sellers. We also study two variants of the dynamic mechanism that guarantee no penalty risk for the seller, and/or monitor the <b>wind</b> <b>condition.</b> We illustrate our results with a numerical example...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{prospects}} of resource-effective technologies in power industry is control of electric equipment condition. Effectiveness of any electrical energy system strongly depends on stable work of power supply equipment. It, in turn, is defined by timely and reliable control of equipment condition. Power transformers are the key element of an electrical energy system. Winding defects caused by short circuit currents are the reason for an emergency situation. Reliable control of <b>winding</b> <b>condition</b> is an urgent task of modern power engineering technology. This paper deals with the experimental research of pulsed method of transformer winding control. A new approach to the <b>winding</b> <b>condition</b> control technology is described. The proposed method is based on short nanosecond range (compared to typical pulsed technology) probing impulse and front impulse durations. Experimental results of sensitivity growth at the nanosecond probing impulse duration are shown. Experimental equipment and measurements are described. Comparison of experimental results of the proposed pulsed method and FRA is given. It is shown that probing impulse of nanosecond duration allows upgrading sensitivity of diagnostics procedure. The main proposals are confirmed by measurement results obtained in the electric energy system transformer for different types of winding defects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{observed}} near-surface {{circulation in}} the Santa Barbara Channel indicates in particular two patterns: a dominant cyclonic circulation mode and a less frequent upwelling flow mode. To explain the dynamics that may govern these two flow regimes, momentum balance from a hindcast model of currents in the channel, forced by observed hourly winds and hydrographic data, was calculated. The along-channel balance {{was found to}} be between wind, which was eastward (i. e., equatorward), sea level tilt, which was westward (i. e., poleward), and Coriolis, which was westward if the wind was (1) intense west and east of the channel and was eastward if the wind was (2) weaker in the east. <b>Wind</b> <b>condition</b> 1 produced southward cross-channel flow in the midchannel, connected by eastward currents upstream (downstream) along the northern (southern) coast of the channel, while <b>wind</b> <b>condition</b> 2 produced northward cross-channel flow connected by cyclonic recirculation in the west and westward inflow in the east. It is suggested that the former corresponds to the dynamical balance that may occur in the upwelling flow mode, while the latter corresponds to the cyclonic circulation mode. 1...|$|R
