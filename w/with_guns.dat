5|$|Brazil ordered six Jurua-class {{ships from}} Britain in 1938. These ships were {{purchased}} by Britain on {{the outbreak of}} war in 1939 and are described above. The Brazilians decided to produce indigenous destroyers, the , at the Ilha das Cobras shipyard, Rio de Janeiro. The design {{was based on the}} H-class plans supplied by Britain, but <b>with</b> <b>guns</b> and machinery supplied by the United States. Although laid down in 1940, the ships were not completed until 1949–51.|$|E

5|$|By the {{following}} day a deal was brokered between the students and university officials, and on April 20, the takeover ended, with the administration ceding {{to some of the}} Afro-American Society's demands. The students emerged making a black-power salute and <b>with</b> <b>guns</b> in hand (the guns had been brought into Willard Straight Hall after the initial takeover). James A.

5|$|The Wiesbaden {{class was}} the first German light cruiser design to mount 15cm guns, though the Pillau class was {{completed}} <b>with</b> <b>guns</b> of this caliber first. The Wiesbaden-class ships were otherwise {{very similar to the}} preceding Graudenz class; they were slightly larger, but had the same speed and identical armor protection.|$|E

5|$|The {{adoption}} of steam power {{was only one}} of a number of technological advances which revolutionized warship design in the 19th century.

5|$|The {{last big}} {{battle between the}} Colorado-Gila River alliances took place in August 1857, when about 100 Yavapai, Quechan, and Mohave warriors {{attacked}} a settlement of Maricopa near Pima Butte. After overwhelming the Maricopa, the Yavapai left. A group of Pima, supplied <b>with</b> <b>guns</b> and horses from US troops, arrived and routed the remaining Mohave and Quechans.|$|E
5|$|A cryptozoologist named Lincoln Anderson, a {{biologist}} named Wendy Gardner, and a hunter named Cameron Caine visit {{the town and}} have a brief meeting with Overman to discuss capturing the shark. With six of his friends, armed <b>with</b> <b>guns,</b> Mike ventures into the forest to hunt the shark. The shark kills each person except for Mike. Following this, Chapman, Lincoln, Wendy, and Cameron {{make their way into}} the woods, armed with a miniature crossbow, a shotgun, and a motion-sensing camera. They set up the camera on a tree and depart. At the town bar, Professor Hoffman enters, having gone into hiding and now wearing an eyepatch. Later, he and a grieving Mike drink beers.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} {{ammunition}} {{has been developed}} for use by tanks <b>with</b> <b>guns</b> based on Rheinmetall's original L/44 design. This includes a series of kinetic energy penetrators, such as the American M829 series, and high explosive anti-tank warheads. Recent ammunition includes a range of anti-personnel rounds and demolition munitions. The LAHAT, developed in Israel, is a gun-launched missile which has received interest from Germany and other Leopard 2 users, and is designed to defeat both land armour and combat helicopters. The Israelis also introduced a new anti-personnel munition which limits collateral damage by controlling the fragmentation of the projectile.|$|E
5|$|An early-war Army {{anti-aircraft}} company (Flugabwehr-Kompanie) {{was organized}} in three platoons {{with a total}} of eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/4s, twelve <b>with</b> <b>guns</b> and six carrying ammunition. When the four-barrel 2 cm Flakvierling 38 was fielded in 1941 each platoon had four Sd.Kfz. 10/4s towing the guns and another for ammunition. Later these companies were reorganized {{with a total of}} eight Sd.Kfz. 10/4s carrying guns, two towing Flakvierlings and three carrying ammunition. These are just examples of some of the Army organizations which differed depending on the unit and the period. Sd.Kfz. 10/5s were substituted for 10/4s on a one for one basis. Detailed records do not survive for the Luftwaffe light anti-aircraft units, but they appear to have been organized into batteries of nine or twelve guns.|$|E
5|$|Birds are hunted in many {{countries}} around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as mallard, wigeon, shoveler and teal have for centuries been captured by wildfowlers, while pheasants, partridges, grouse, and snipe are among the terrestrial birds that are hunted for sport, generally <b>with</b> <b>guns.</b> In {{other parts of the}} world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where cassowaries, crowned pigeons, hornbills and megapodes are captured for food. Seabirds such as muttonbirds, penguins and auks have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the great auk, extinct. Seabird hunting continues at more moderate levels today, for instance with the traditional Māori harvest of sooty shearwater chicks.|$|E

5|$|In April 2011 {{the band}} {{announced}} that Vivian Campbell {{would be leaving}} Thin Lizzy amicably to rejoin Def Leppard after one final gig on 28 May. He was replaced by Guns N' Roses guitarist Richard Fortus. On 28 August, {{it was announced that}} Damon Johnson of Alice Cooper's band would be replacing Fortus for Thin Lizzy's tour of the US with Judas Priest. Fortus returned to tour <b>with</b> <b>Guns</b> N' Roses {{for the rest of the}} year, and Johnson has since replaced Fortus permanently.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Rose resurfaced <b>with</b> <b>Guns</b> N' Roses at Rock in Rio 3 to {{commence}} the decade-long Chinese Democracy Tour, though {{the majority of}} its scheduled concerts {{over the next two years}} did not take place. A critically panned surprise appearance at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards was followed by an incident in November when a riot erupted at Vancouver's General Motors Place after Rose failed to show up for a scheduled concert. When venue staff announced the cancellation, a riot broke out, resulting in an estimated $100,000 in damages. As the band's line-up continued to evolve, his constant bandmates were guitarist Richard Fortus, bassist Tommy Stinson, and keyboardists Dizzy Reed and Chris Pitman.|$|E
5|$|Kronan {{was one of}} {{the most}} heavily armed {{warships}} in the world in 1672 when she was launched, a three-decker with 110 guns. The ship had three full gundecks <b>with</b> <b>guns</b> from bow to stern. Altogether there were seven separate levels, divided by six decks. Furthest down in the ship, above the keel, was the hold, and immediately above it, but still below the waterline, lay the orlop; both were used primarily for storage. Above the orlop were the three gundecks, two of them covered, while about half of the topmost gundeck was open to the elements in the ship's middle, or waist. The bow had one deck, making up the forecastle, and the stern had two decks, including a poop deck.|$|E

5|$|Laid up at Chatham {{during the}} years of peace, Bellerophon was not {{commissioned}} until July 1790, when the crisis known as the Spanish Armament broke out. As war with Spain threatened, warships lying in ordinary began to be commissioned and fitted for sea. Bellerophons first commander, Captain Thomas Pasley, arrived on 19 July and began the process of preparing her for service. After a month spent fitting out the ship <b>with</b> <b>guns,</b> masts, stores and rigging, and recruiting a crew, Pasley gave the orders for his crew to slip the moorings on 16 August, and Bellerophon made her way down the Medway to the fleet anchorage at the Nore.|$|E
5|$|Matti Juhani Saari (20 May 1986 – 23 September 2008) was {{identified}} as the gunman responsible for the shooting. Saari, a hospitality management student at the school, {{was thrown out of}} the Finnish Army in 2006, after being a member for only a month for opening fire in a woodland exercise, against orders. Saari had been the victim of bullying in secondary school and dropped out of his classes for this reason. A friend of Saari also reported that he had been seeing a psychologist in the months before the shooting, and had been obsessed <b>with</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 14 May 1940, Secretary of State for War Anthony Eden {{announced}} {{the creation of}} the Local Defence Volunteers (LDV)—later to become known as the Home Guard. Far more men volunteered than the government expected {{and by the end of}} June, there were nearly 1.5million volunteers. There were plenty of personnel for the defence of the country, but there were no uniforms (a simple armband had to suffice) and equipment was in critically short supply. At first, the Home Guard was armed <b>with</b> <b>guns</b> in private ownership, a knife or bayonet on a pole, Molotov cocktails and improvised flamethrowers.|$|E
