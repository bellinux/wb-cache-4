40|$|Antibodies to pure lysyl hydroxylase from <b>whole</b> <b>chick</b> embryos were {{prepared}} in rabbits {{and used for}} immunological characterization of this enzyme of collagen biosynthesis. In double immunodiffusion a single precipitation line was seen between the antiserum and crude or pure chick-embryo lysyl hydroxylase. The antiserum effectively inhibited chick-embryo lysyl hydroxylase activity, whether measured with the biologically prepared protocollagen substrate or a synthetic peptide consisting of only 12 amino acids. This suggests that the antigenic determinant was located near the active site of the enzyme molecule. Essentially identical amounts of the antiserum were required for 40 % inhibition of {{the same amount of}} lysyl hydroxylase activity units from different chick-embryo tissues synthesizing various genetically distinct collagen types. In double immunodiffusion a single precipitation line of complete identity was found between the antiserum and the purified enzyme from <b>whole</b> <b>chick</b> embryos and the crude enzymes from chick-embryo tendon, cartilage and kidneys. These results do not support the hypothesis that lysyl hydroxylase has collagen-type-specific or tissue-specific isoenzymes with markedly different specific activities or immunological properties.

Nevertheless, a distinct, although weak, cross-reactivity was found between the chick-embryo enzyme and those from all mammalian tissues tested. The antiserum showed no cross-reactivity against prolyl 3 -hydroxylase, hydroxylysyl galactosyl-transferase or galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase in activity-inhibition assays, whereas a distinct cross-reactivity was found against prolyl 4 -hydroxylase.

Anti-fibronectin antibodies applied to the basal side of the blastoderm led rapidly and reversibly to an increase of tension in the contracted cells.

40|$|AbstractThe {{elaboration}} of distinct cell types during development {{is dependent on}} {{a small number of}} inductive molecules. Among these inducers is Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which, in combination with other factors, patterns the dorsoventral (DV) axis of the nervous system. The response of a cell is dependent in part on its complement of cyclic nucleotides. cAMP antagonizes Shh signaling, and we examined the influence of cGMP on the Shh response. Cells in chick neural plate explants respond to Shh by differentiating into ventral neural-cell types. Exposure of intermediate-zone explants to cGMP analogs enhanced their response to Shh in a dose-dependent manner. The Shh response was also enhanced in dorsal-zone explants exposed to chick natriuretic peptide (chNP), which stimulates cGMP production by membrane-bound guanylate cyclase (mGC). Addition of chNP to intermediate-zone explants did not enhance the Shh response, consistent with a reported lack of mGC in this region of the neural tube. Finally, the presence of a nitric oxide (NO) -sensitive guanylate cyclase (GC) was established by demonstrating cGMP immunoreactivity in neural tissue following NO stimulation of <b>whole</b> <b>chick</b> embryos. Intracellular levels of cGMP and cAMP may thus provide a mechanism through which other factors modulate the Shh response during neural development...|$|E

When cortisol acetate was given as repeated injections {{over a period of}} 4 days, both collagen synthesis and the enzyme activities decreased. The hydroxylase activities decreased even more than the two collagen glycosyltransferase activities, both in isolated cells and in <b>whole</b> <b>chick</b> embryos. The amount of prolyl hydroxylase protein diminished to the same extent as the enzyme activity, indicating that cortisol acetate inhibits enzyme synthesis. The inhibitory effect of cortisol acetate on collagen synthesis and on the enzyme activities was partially reversible in 3 days. Total protein synthesis was completely restored within this time. Only massive doses of cortisol acetate inhibited collagen synthesis in vitro. Additional experiments indicated that cortisol acetate did not decrease the rate of the enzyme reactions when added directly to the enzyme incubation mixtures.

Neural crest cell-free zones lateral to rhombomere 3 (r 3) and r 5 resulted from neural crest cells migrating in either rostral or caudal directions to join other neural crest cells exiting adjacent to r 2, r 4, or r 6. Neural crest cells migrated {{in a wide variety of}} individual cell behaviors, ranging from rapid unidirectional motion to stationary and even backward movement (toward the neural tube). Neural crest cells also migrated collectively, extending filipodia to form chain-like cell arrangements. In the midbrain and r 1 region, many chains stretched from the dorsal midline to just beyond the lateral extent of the neural tube. In the r 7 region, cells linked together and stretched laterally from the neural tube to other neural crest cells migrating into the third branchial arch. The unpredictable cell trajectories, the mixing of neural crest cells between adjoining rhombomeres, and the diversity in cell migration behavior within any particular region imply that no single mechanism guides migration.

40|$|During {{development}} of the lens, epithelial cells at the lens equator begin a differentiation process to become secondary fibre cells. The differentiating cells elongate and migrate towards {{the centre of the}} lens where they envelop the older, central fibre cells. Differentiation into fibre cells is accompanied by the breakdown of all organelles, such as the mitochondria. All organelle degradation is completed and denucleation occurs at the border of the organelle free zone (OFZ) which contains the central, terminally differentiated, fibre cells. The differentiation pathway is not well characterised, though it is believed to have similarities to an attenuated form of apoptosis supported by the identification of apoptosis related genes, such as TNF, in the lens. This study continues the search for and characterisation of apoptosis related genes expressed during lens development, focusing on TNFs and their extended family. Reverse Transcriptase-(RT-) PCR was carried out, identifying a number of TNF and extended family member genes in the chick lens, expression studies established novel, statistically significant differential expression for TRAF 2 and TRAF 3. TRAF 2 protein expression from western blotting, similar to RT-PCR expression was found to decline as the lens developed. TRAF 2 localisation studies showed limited expression in the equatorial region but there was extensive signalling found in the developing iris, a region in the corneal-scleral boundary and some staining was also detected in the ciliary body. TRAF 3 protein and RT-PCR expression were similar, with increasing expression as the lens developed. Western blotting identified two bands and subcellular fractionation confirmed different localisation for the two isoforms. Immunofluorescence identified increasing TRAF 3 staining in the cortical fibre cells, this staining was found to be similar to proteins that were reported to be involved in lens fibre cell remodelling and maintenance, suggesting a possibly similar role for TRAF 3. Following interest in TRAIL as a gene therapy for Posterior Capsule Opacification (PCO) its expression was examined using RT-PCR and Western blotting which showed low, similar levels of expression throughout the stages of lens development studied. Peroxidase staining showed interesting staining in the equatorial epithelial cells and those just beginning to differentiate at the transition zone. Novel nuclear staining was identified at all time points in both epithelial and fibre cells containing nuclei. Characterisation of whole lens culture was undertaken to discover the optimum culture system for the <b>whole</b> <b>chick</b> lens. Of the published research using <b>whole</b> <b>chick</b> lens culture none stated the basic morphology of the developing lens in organ culture, though each lab had their preferred methodology. The characterisation resulted in the preference of E 10 chick lenses being grown with vitreous attached in medium containing glucose. Understanding the morphology of lenses in culture will be invaluable when undertaking the functional studies required to clarify the roles in the lens of the newly identified genes, specifically TRAF 2 and TRAF 3.

40|$|Abstract. Primary chondrocytes from <b>whole</b> <b>chick</b> embryo sterna can be {{maintained}} in suspension culture stabilized with agarose for extended periods of time. In the absence of FBS, the cells remain viable only when seeded at high densities. They do not proliferate at a high rate but they deposit extracellular matrix with fibrils resembling those of authentic embryonic cartilage in their appearance and collagen composition. The cells exhibit many morphological and biochemical characteristics of resting chondrocytes {{and they do not}} produce collagen X, a marker for hypertrophic cartilage undergoing endochondral ossification. T HE phenotype of cartilage cells is subject to extensive modulation in situ as well as in tissue culture (Kosher, 1983). In cartilage, cell differentiation is a multistep process starting from chondrogenic mesenchymal cells and eventually resulting in mature, hypertrophic chondrocytes with high metabolic activity. Usually, that stage is reached only in cartilage undergoing endochondral ossification during development, growth, or repair of bones. In permanent cartilage, e. g., normal articular cartilage close to the joint surface, terminal chondrocyte differentiation does not take place but is interrupted at the stage of resting chondrocytes. These cells display only moderate metabolic activity sufficient for normal tissue turnover. Chondrocyte differentiation is accompanied by a switch of gene activation. Mesenchymal cells produce collagens I and III, whereas chondrocytes synthesize cartilage specific proteoglycans and collagens II, IX, and XI. Hypertrophic chondrocytes also produce collagen X, a biochemical marker for this stage of cell differentiation (Schmid and Conrad, 1982...|$|E
40|$|Brain actin {{extracted}} from an acetone powder of chick brains was purified by {{a cycle of}} polymerization-depolymerization followed by molecular sieve chromatography. The brain actin had a subunit molecular weight of 42, 000 daltons as determined by co-electrophoresis with muscle actin. It underwent salt-dependent g to f transformation to form double helical actin filaments which could be "decorated" by muscle myosin subfragment 1. A critical concentration for polymerization of 1. 3 microM was determined by measuring either the change in viscosity or absorbance at 232 nm. Brain actin was also capable of stimulating the ATPase activity of muscle myosin. Brain myosin was isolated from <b>whole</b> <b>chick</b> brain by a procedure involving high salt extraction, ammonium sulfate fractionation and molecular sieve chromatography. The purified myosin was composed of a 200, 000 -dalton heavy chain and three lower molecular weight light chains. In 0. 6 M KCl the brain myosin had ATPase activity which was inhibited by Mg++, stimulated by Ca++, and maximally activated by EDTA. When dialyzed against 0. 1 M KCl, the brain myosin self-assembled into short bipolar filaments. The bipolar filaments associated {{with each other to}} form long concatamers, and this association was enhanced by high concentrations of Mg++ ion. The brain myosin did not interact with chicken skeletal muscle myosin to form hybrid filaments. Furthermore, antibody recognition studies demonstrated that myosins from chicken brain, skeletal muscle, and smooth muscle were unique...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Using top predators as {{sentinels}} of {{the marine}} environment, Hg contamination was investigated within the large subantarctic seabird community of Kerguelen Islands, a remote area from the poorly known Southern Indian Ocean. Chicks of 21 sympatric seabirds presented {{a wide range of}} Hg concentrations, with the highest contaminated species containing ~ 102 times more feather Hg than the less contaminated species. Hence, Kerguelen seabirds encompass the <b>whole</b> range of <b>chick</b> feather Hg values that were previously collected worldwide in poorly industrialized localities. Using stable isotopes, the effects of foraging habitats (reflected by δ 13 C) and trophic positions (reflected by δ 15 N) on Hg concentrations were investigated. Species-related Hg variations were highly and positively linked to feather δ 15 N values, thus highlighting the occurrence of efficient Hg biomagnification processes within subantarctic marine trophic webs. By contrast, Hg contamination overall correlated poorly with feeding habitats, because of the pooling of species foraging within different isotopic gradients corresponding to distinct seabird habitats (benthic, pelagic, neritic and oceanic). However, when focusing on oceanic seabirds, Hg concentration was related to feathe...|$|R

In ovo imaging allowed us to visualize neural crest cell migration 2 - 3 times longer than in whole embryo explant cultures, providing a more complete picture {{of the dynamics of}} cell migration from emergence at the dorsal midline to entry into the branchial arches. There were aspects of the in ovo neural crest cell migration patterning which were new and different. Surprisingly, there was contact between neural crest cell migration streams bound for different branchial arches. This cell-cell contact occurred in the region lateral to the otic vesicle, where neural crest cells within the distinct streams diverted from their migration pathways into the branchial arches and instead migrated around the otic vesicle to establish a contact between streams. Some individual neural crest cells did appear to cross between the streams, but there was no widespread mixing. Analysis of individual cell trajectories showed that neural crest cells emerge from all rhombomeres (r) and sort into distinct exiting streams adjacent to the even-numbered rhombomeres. Neural crest cell migration behaviors resembled the wide diversity seen in <b>whole</b> embryo <b>chick</b> explants, including chain-like cell arrangements; however, average in ovo cell speeds are as much as 70 % faster. To test to what extent neural crest cells from adjoining rhombomeres mix along migration routes and within the branchial arches, separate groups of premigratory neural crest cells were labeled with DiI or DiD. Results showed that r 6 and r 7 neural crest cells migrated to the same spatial location within the fourth branchial arch. The diversity of migration behaviors suggests that no single mechanism guides in ovo hindbrain neural crest cell migration into the branchial arches. The cell-cell contact between migration streams and the co-localization of neural crest cells from adjoining rhombomeres within a single branchial arch support the notion that the pattern of hindbrain neural crest cell migration emerges dynamically with cell-cell communication playing an important guidance role...|$|R
40|$|HILE {{attempting}} to conduct vi-tamin K bioassays, using <b>chick</b> <b>whole</b> blood prothrombin times to estab-lish a standard curve, some obviously erratic prothrombin times {{were obtained for}} chicks within each respective standard curve test group. Before continuing fur-ther with the chick bioassays, it was neces-sary to learn what factors might possibly be influencing the results. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the effect of holding time and temperature upon prothrombin time of whole-oxalated blood. EXPERIMENTAL Cardiac blood (4. 5 cc.) was withdrawn from each of three birds and transferred to separate test tubes containing 0. 5 cc. of sodium oxalate. A control prothrombin time for each sample was determined immediately using 0. 2 cc. of oxalated blood. The remaining oxalated blood (2 cc.) was equally divided among ten test tubes {{for each of the three}} samples. Five of the tubes were placed in a refrigerated environment and five were kept at room temperature. Prothrombin times were determined 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 hours after cardiac puncture. During the experimental period, the temperature of the room ranged from 24. 4 °C. to 32. 2 °C. with a mean of 27. 9 °C, and the tempera-ture within the refrigerator ranged from 4. 4 °C. to 6. 7 °C. with a mean of 6. 0 °C...|$|R
