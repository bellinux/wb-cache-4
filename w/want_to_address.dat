500|$|New Line Cinema's Toby Emmerich {{approached}} Platinum Dunes producers Michael Bay, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form about remaking Friday the 13th in {{the same}} way they restarted The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise. They agreed and spent over a year obtaining the film rights from Paramount Pictures, New Line and Crystal Lake Entertainmentthe latter run by Friday the 13th creator Sean S. Cunningham. Paramount executives gave Platinum Dunes producers a license to use anything from the original films, including the title. Paramount was given the rights to distribute the film internationally and New Line retained U.S. distribution rights. Fuller and Form said {{they did not want to}} make Friday the 13th Part 11 or 12, but wanted to rework the mythology. They liked elements from the first four filmssuch as plot points and ways particular characters are killedand planned to use these in their remake, which they did with Paramount's approval. Fuller said, [...] "I think there are moments we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>address,</b> like how does the hockey mask happen. It’ll happen differently in our movie than in the third one. Where is Jason from, why do these killings happen, and what is Crystal Lake?" [...] The producers initially expressed an interest in using Tommy Jarvis, a recurring character who first appeared in , but the idea was scrapped.|$|E
500|$|After {{more than}} 15 years of off-and-on development, and {{approximately}} $6 million spent in 18 unused scripts {{from more than}} a dozen screenwriters, New Line finally produced a Freddy and Jason crossover for 2003. One of the biggest hurdles for the film was developing a story that managed to bring the two horror icons together. Potential stories varied widely, from Freddy having molested and drowned Jason as a child, to a cult of Freddy worshipers called the [...] "Fred Heads". In January 2007, Platinum Dunes producers Andrew Form and Brad Fuller outlined their intended goal to bring a Friday the 13th reboot to life. New Line approached Fuller and Form to create a reboot, but because Paramount still owned certain copyrights to the first film, the reboot {{would not be able to}} use anything from the original. Paramount, who wanted to be included in the development of a reboot, approached the producers and gave them license to use anything from the original films, including the title. With Paramount on board, Fuller and Form decided they wanted to use pieces from the early films. Fuller said, [...] "I think there are moments we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>address,</b> like how does the hockey mask happen." [...] Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, writers of Freddy vs. Jason, were brought on to pen the script for the new film, with Marcus Nispel, director of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake of 2003, hired in November 2007 to direct.|$|E
500|$|... "Next" [...] {{was written}} by Jenna Bans and Kevin Murphy and {{directed}} by Larry Shaw. While developing storylines for the second season, series creator Marc Cherry stated, [...] "I want to keep {{finding new ways to}} talk about issues that relate to everyday women," [...] explaining that the show needs to focus on [...] "small, real, everyday issues" [...] {{in order to keep the}} audience interested. Cherry cited the Lynette storyline as an example of this strategy: [...] "Lynette will have a job next season (returning to her advertising roots), so I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> how difficult it is to go to work all day and then come home and be expected to also take care of your house." [...] Huffman recognized that her character's storylines needed a change of pace, but hoped that Lynette's domestic life would still play an integral role this season. [...] "My hope is to not get lost in the corporate world; that it's still a home and family/husband and children story," [...] she explained. [...] "But how many times can you go, 'Kids, clear your plates!'" [...] The episode also introduced Joely Fisher as Lynette's new boss, Nina Fletcher. Fisher describes her character as [...] "nasty," [...] elaborating: [...] "Lynette suddenly has to come up against this tiger lady who never stops reminding Lynette that she's childless by choice. Even though Nina is not a housewife, she is desperate in her own way." [...] Due to the death of his character, Steven Culp did not return to the series for the second season. For the open casket scene in [...] "Next", producers created a life mask of the actor. Savant was promoted to series regular after appearing as a recurring guest star throughout the first season.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contemporary}} society, adolescents {{also face}} some risks as their sexuality begins to transform. While some of these, such as emotional distress (fear of abuse or exploitation) and sexually transmitted infections/diseases (STIs/STDs), including HIV/AIDS, {{are not necessarily}} inherent to adolescence, others such as teenage pregnancy (through non-use or failure of contraceptives) are seen as social problems in most western societies. One in four sexually active teenagers will contract an STI. Adolescents in the United States often chose [...] "anything but intercourse" [...] for sexual activity because they mistakenly believe it {{reduces the risk of}} STIs. Across the country, clinicians report rising diagnoses of herpes and human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause genital warts, and is now thought to affect 15 percent of the teen population. Girls 15 to 19 have higher rates of gonorrhea than any other age group. One-quarter of all new HIV cases occur in those under the age of 21. Multrine also states in her article that according to a March survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, eighty-one percent of parents want schools to discuss the use of condoms and contraception with their children. They also believe students should be able to be tested for STIs. Furthermore, teachers <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> such topics with their students. But, although 9 in 10 sex education instructors across the country believe that students should be taught about contraceptives in school, over one quarter report receiving explicit instructions from school boards and administrators not to do so. According to anthropologist Margaret Mead, the turmoil found in adolescence in Western society has a cultural rather than a physical cause; they reported that societies where young women engaged in free sexual activity had no such adolescent turmoil.|$|E

6000|$|Has Mr. Tulkinghorn {{any idea}} of this himself? It may be so, or it may not, but there is this {{remarkable}} circumstance to be noted in everything associated with my Lady Dedlock {{as one of a}} class--as one of the leaders and representatives of her little world. She supposes herself to be an inscrutable Being, quite out of the reach and ken of ordinary mortals--seeing herself in her glass, where indeed she looks so. Yet every dim little star revolving about her, from her maid to the manager of the Italian Opera, knows her weaknesses, prejudices, follies, haughtinesses, and caprices and lives upon as accurate a calculation and as nice a measure of her moral nature as her dressmaker takes of her physical proportions. Is a new dress, a new custom, a new singer, a new dancer, a new form of jewellery, a new dwarf or giant, a new chapel, a new anything, to be set up? There are deferential people in a dozen callings whom my Lady Dedlock suspects of nothing but prostration before her, who can tell you how to manage {{her as if she were}} a baby, who do nothing but nurse her all their lives, who, humbly affecting to follow with profound subservience, lead her and her whole troop after them; who, in hooking one, hook all and bear them off as Lemuel Gulliver bore away the stately fleet of the majestic Lilliput. [...] "If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>address</b> our people, sir," [...] say Blaze and Sparkle, the jewellers--meaning by our people Lady Dedlock and the rest--"you must remember that you are not dealing with the general public; you must hit our people in their weakest place, and their weakest place is such a place." [...] "To make this article go down, gentlemen," [...] say Sheen and Gloss, the mercers, to their friends the manufacturers, [...] "you must come to us, because we know where to have the fashionable people, and we can make it fashionable." [...] "If you want to get this print upon the tables of my high connexion, sir," [...] says Mr. Sladdery, the librarian, [...] "or if you want to get this dwarf or giant into the houses of my high connexion, sir, or if you want to secure to this entertainment the patronage of my high connexion, sir, you must leave it, if you please, to me, for I have been accustomed to study the leaders of my high connexion, sir, and I may tell you without vanity that I can turn them round my finger"--in which Mr. Sladdery, who is an honest man, does not exaggerate at all.|$|E
