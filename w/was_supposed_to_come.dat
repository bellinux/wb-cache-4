According to Fraser, Kerr {{asked him whether}} he, if {{commissioned}} Prime Minister, could secure supply, would immediately thereafter advise a double-dissolution election, and would refrain from new policies and investigations of the Whitlam Government pending the election. Fraser stated that he agreed. Kerr denied the exchange took place via telephone, though both men agree those questions were asked {{later in the day}} before Kerr commissioned Fraser as Prime Minister.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the three species known from remains, several hypothetical extinct Ara macaws were only based on contemporary accounts, but are considered dubious today. Many of these were named by Walter Rothschild in the early 20th century, who {{had a tendency to}} name species based on little tangible evidence. Among others, the red-headed macaw (Ara erythrocephala) and Jamaican red macaw (Ara gossei) were named for accounts of macaws on Jamaica, the Martinique macaw (Ara martinicus) was from Martinique island, and the Dominican green-and-yellow macaw (Ara atwoodi) <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from Dominica island.|$|E
25|$|With much {{of western}} {{mainland}} Southeast Asia under his control, Bayinnaung now felt {{ready to take}} on Siam. He needed an overwhelming advantage in manpower over Siam because unlike interior Shan states, Siam could not be overwhelmed by the strength of his Portuguese firearms alone. Siam was a prosperous coastal power in its own right, and its forces included Portuguese firearms, ships and mercenaries. On 16 July 1563, he sent an embassy to Siam, demanding one of the four white elephants in possession of the Siamese king as tribute. As expected, King Maha Chakkraphat duly refused. On 1 November 1563, five armies (60,000 men, 2400 horses and 360 elephants) left Pegu to start the campaign. Another army from Lan Na <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down but King Mekuti of Lan Na had revolted.|$|E

50|$|If {{there are}} 8 I/O pins {{controlling}} the array, {{this means that}} there will be 6 parasitic paths through pairs of 2 LEDs, and 12 LEDs may be unintentionally lit, but fortunately this will only happen when the one bad LED <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> on, which may be {{a small fraction of the}} time and will exhibit no deleterious symptoms when the problem LED <b>is</b> not <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lit.

He also noted the development in Liz and Jenna's friendship, learning that they go [...] "way back" [...] as friends and as a comedy team. Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad disagreed, however. She felt that the show had too many storylines and that this episode made it seem as if the show was about the relationship between Liz and Jenna, rather than the storylines introduced in the pilot. She said that having several ongoing storylines is possible, but the show needs some kind of center.|$|E
500|$|With {{this basic}} concept in mind, the creators had 3 months {{to define a}} visual {{identity}} and a setting for their game, prior to development. The game would be set in a post-apocalyptic science fantasy world, featuring ruins and relics of a fallen civilization and mankind struggling for survival, something typical in anime at that time. Futatsugi was particularly influenced {{by one of his}} childhood readings, The Long Afternoon of Earth, a science-fiction novel by Brian Aldiss, in which one side of the earth became perpetually hot, the other perpetually cold. The first presentation video featured a green dragon, in line with traditional European/medieval depictions, however the team quickly decided to change it and make it [...] "more sci-fi". In order for the dragon to be more original, it was made blue and covered in a white, bone-like armor. The dragon <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from the ancient times, so ruins and ancient flying technology also featured this white, shell-like material.|$|E
500|$|... "Leonard Betts" [...] {{was written}} by Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz and {{directed}} by Kim Manners. Scripts written by Gilligan, Shiban, and Spotnitz would later go on to be humorously referred to as creations of a [...] "John Gillnitz"—a portmanteau of the three writers' names. According to Spotnitz, the script for [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] was [...] "not particularly well-loved at the time". Spotnitz later noted, however, that the episode became [...] "one of [...] favorite monster shows". Originally, the episode [...] "Never Again" [...] <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> before the episode. Vince Gilligan explained, [...] " [...] really wanted to grab viewers who had never seen us before , and we knew {{the best way to}} do that would be with a really creepy stand-alone monster story." [...] Thus, the air date of [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] was flipped with [...] "Never Again" [...] in order to ensure that the former episode, which featured the show's two stars in their traditional roles, aired after the Super Bowl. Anderson has said that she would have played the part differently in [...] "Never Again"—which featured Scully acting notably out of character—had she been aware that Scully would get cancer at the time, as Scully only discovers this at the end of [...] "Leonard Betts".|$|E

60|$|On {{the fourth}} floor there was an open door. The room was empty. It was a good {{representative}} Pleasant Street back room.

60|$|But {{there were}} other objects of delight and {{interest}} claiming his instant attention: there were quaint twisted candlesticks {{in the shape of}} snakes, and a teapot fashioned like a china duck, out of whose open beak the tea <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> How dull and shapeless the nursery teapot seemed in comparison! And there was a carved sandal-wood box packed tight with aromatic cotton-wool, and between the layers of cotton-wool were little brass figures, hump-necked bulls, and peacocks and goblins, delightful to see and to handle. Less promising in appearance was a large square book with plain black covers; Nicholas peeped into it, and, behold, it was full of coloured pictures of birds. And such birds! In the garden, and in the lanes when he went for a walk, Nicholas came across a few birds, of which the largest were an occasional magpie or wood-pigeon; here were herons and bustards, kites, toucans, tiger-bitterns, brush turkeys, ibises, golden pheasants, a whole portrait gallery of undreamed-of creatures. And as he was admiring the colouring of the mandarin duck and assigning a life-history to it, the voice of his aunt in shrill vociferation of his name came from the gooseberry garden without. She had grown suspicious at his long disappearance, and had leapt to the conclusion that he had climbed over the wall behind the sheltering screen of the lilac bushes; she was now engaged in energetic and rather hopeless search for him among the artichokes and raspberry canes.|$|E

60|$|The {{discovery}} that Belding alluded to {{was one that}} might very well lead to {{the making of a}} wonderful and agricultural district of Altar Valley. While in college Dick Gale had studied engineering, but he had not set the scientific world afire with his brilliance. Nor after leaving college had he been able to satisfy his father that he could hold a job. Nevertheless, his smattering of engineering skill bore fruit in the last place on earth where anything might have been expected of it--in the desert. Gale had always wondered about the source of Forlorn River. No white man or Mexican, or, so far as known, no Indian, had climbed those mighty broken steps of rock called No Name Mountains, from which Forlorn River <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Gale had discovered a long, narrow, rock-bottomed and rock-walled gulch that could be dammed at the lower end by the dynamiting of leaning cliffs above. An inexhaustible supply of water could be stored there. Furthermore, he had worked out an irrigation plan to bring the water down for mining uses, and to make a paradise out of that part of Altar Valley which lay in the United States. Belding claimed there was gold in the arroyos, gold in the gulches, not in quantities to make a prospector rejoice, but enough to work for. And the soil on the higher levels of Altar Valley needed only water to make it grow anything the year round. Gale, too, had come to have dreams of a future for Forlorn River.|$|E
60|$|In {{the preface}} to the former edition of this Letter a fourth was {{mentioned}} as being in possession of Mr. Burke's friends. It was in fact announced by the author himself, in {{the conclusion of the}} second, which it was then designed to follow. He intended, he said, to proceed next {{on the question of the}} facilities possessed by the French Republic, from the internal state of other nations, and particularly of this, for obtaining her ends,--and as his notions were controverted, to take notice of what, in that way, had been recommended to him. The vehicle which he had chosen for this part of his plan was an answer to a pamphlet which <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from high authority, and was circulated by ministers with great industry, at the time of its appearance, in October, 1795, immediately previous to that session of Parliament when his Majesty for the first time declared that the appearance of any disposition in the enemy to negotiate for general peace should not fail to be met with an earnest desire to give it the fullest and speediest effect. In truth, the answer, which is full of spirit and vivacity, was written the latter end of the same year, but was laid aside when the question assumed a more serious aspect, from the commencement of an actual negotiation, which gave rise to the series of printed letters. Afterwards, he began to rewrite it, with a view of accommodating it to his new purpose. The greater part, however, still remained in its original state; and several heroes of the Revolution, who are there celebrated, having in the interval passed off the public stage, a greater liberty of insertion and alteration than his friends on consideration have thought allowable would be necessary to adapt it to that place in the series for which it was ultimately designed by the author. This piece, therefore, addressed, as the title originally stood, to his noble friend, Earl Fitzwilliam, will be given the first in the supplemental volumes which will be hereafter added to complete this edition of the author's works.|$|E
6000|$|The Vicar {{had another}} matter of moment {{to discuss with}} his wife. Sam Brattle, after having {{remained}} hard at work at the mill for nearly a fortnight,--so hard at work as to induce his father to declare that he'd bet a guinea there wasn't {{a man in the}} three parishes who could come nigh his Sam for a right down day's work;--after all this, Sam had disappeared, had been gone for two days, and was said by the constable to have been seen at night on the Devizes side, from whence <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> the Grinder, and all manner of Grinder's iniquities. Up to this time no further arrest had been made on account of Mr. Trumbull's murder, nor had any trace been found of the Grinder, or of that other man who had been his companion. The leading policeman, who still had charge of the case, expressed himself as sure that the old woman at Pycroft Common knew nothing of her son's whereabouts; but he had always declared, and still continued to declare, that Sam Brattle could tell them the whole story of the murder if he pleased, and there had been a certain amount of watching kept on the young man, much to his own disgust, and to that of his father. Sam had sworn aloud in the village--so much aloud that he had shown his determination to be heard by all men--that he would go to America, and see whether anyone would dare to stop him. He had been told of his bail, and had replied that he would demand to be relieved of his bail;--that his bail was illegal, and that he would have it all tried in a court of law. Mr. Fenwick had heard of this, and had replied that {{as far as he was}} concerned he was not in the least afraid. He believed that the bail was illegal, and he believed also that Sam would stay where he was. But now Sam was gone, and the Bullhampton constable was clearly of opinion that he had gone to join the Grinder. [...] "At any rate, he's off somewhere," [...] said Mr. Fenwick, [...] "and his mother doesn't know where he's gone. Old Brattle, of course, won't say a word." ...|$|E
