5|$|Beacon Park {{stands on}} land which was {{originally}} low lying, poorly drained pasture alongside the Leamonsley Brook. The Museum Gardens and Recreation Grounds were {{the site of}} Bishops Fish Pool (sometimes known as Upper Pool). The pool was created when a causeway was built on Beacon Street in the 14th century separating it from Minster Pool. The <b>waterlogged</b> marshland surrounding Bishops Fish Pool became known as 'The Moggs' from the 15th century and later 'Swan Moggs'.|$|E
5|$|In July 2016 García, who was Real Sociedad's only {{representative}} in the squad, captained Spain to {{a silver medal}} at the UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship, losing 2–1 in the final to hosts France. She had two opportunities to draw Spain level but found herself {{the victim of a}} <b>waterlogged</b> pitch, missing a penalty in the opening half before skying a near-open goal opportunity in injury-time {{as a result of the}} on-field conditions. The match was suspended for over two hours after half-time due to the weather conditions and upon the players' return to the pitch certain sections of the field were entirely <b>waterlogged.</b> García was ridiculed by large sections of the media for the miss but received overwhelming support from her fan-base, prompting her to take to Instagram following the tournament to thank those who stood behind her and the team. The showpiece match was her third appearance in a continental final, having previously ended as runner-up in the tournament's previous edition and as well as in the UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship in 2014. The record is one which she shares with teammates Andrea Sánchez Falcón and Naria Garrote.|$|E
5|$|Nepenthes rajah usually {{grows in}} open, grassy clearings on old land slips and flat ridge tops, {{particularly}} {{in areas of}} seeping ground water, where the soil is loose and permanently moist. Although these sites can receive very high rainfall, excess water drains away quickly, preventing the soil from becoming <b>waterlogged.</b> N. rajah can often be found growing in grassy undergrowth, especially among sedges.|$|E
5|$|The holly-leaved banksia gives {{its name}} to the Banksia ilicifolia {{woodlands}} ('community type 22'), a possibly threatened ecological community found in the Bassendean and Spearwood systems in the central Swan Coastal Plain north of Rockingham. These are low-lying areas which are seasonally <b>waterlogged.</b> The habitat is open woodland and with an open understorey, and such trees as B. ilicifolia, B. attenuata and stout paperbark (Melaleuca preissiana).|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the park was originally <b>waterlogged</b> marshland and a lake covered the area {{of what is now}} the Museum Gardens. The land was drained in the early 19th century and the Museum Gardens were raised with silt dredged from Minster Pool. The large northern area of the park once formed the land and gardens of Beacon House. This land was incorporated into the park when the owner of Beacon House, Colonel Swinfen Broun, donated the land after his death.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrants {{can grow}} well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, {{as long as}} their {{nutrient}} requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not <b>waterlogged</b> ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas {{are grown}} mostly for their edible beans, {{although}} the leaves, green peas and green pea pods {{can also be}} consumed, meaning the cowpea {{can be used as}} a food source before the dried peas are harvested. Like other legumes, cowpea grain is cooked to make it edible, usually by boiling. Cowpeas can be prepared in stews, soups, purees and casseroles, but the most common way to eat them is in curries. They can also be processed into a paste or flour. Chinese long beans can be eaten raw or cooked, but as they easily become <b>waterlogged</b> are usually sautéed, stir-fried, or deep-fried.|$|E
5|$|In February 1953, Lympne {{was again}} <b>waterlogged</b> and Silver City Airways {{operated}} out of Southend and Blackbushe. The company {{stated that they}} were willing to purchase Lympne, but the decision of Folkestone Town Council was still awaited for. By May, Folkestone Town Council had decided not to purchase Lympne and Silver City Airways again expressed an interest in purchasing the airport at a reasonable price. In November, it was announced that Air Kruise had been given permission to operate a scheduled service from Lympne and/or Ramsgate to Birmingham. The service was to be seasonal between April and September, with permission to run the service lasting until 1960. Air Kruise moved its operations to Ramsgate Airport in 1953.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, {{the castle}} remains {{owned by the}} National Trust and is managed by English Heritage. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and the ruins are {{protected}} under UK law as a Grade I listed building. It lies within the Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and {{is part of a}} Site of Special Scientific Interest, with parts of the site comprising a Special Protection Area for the conservation of wild birds. The National Trust has encouraged the land around the outside of the castle to remain <b>waterlogged</b> to enable the conservation of amphibians and bird species, and the inside of the castle is protected from grazing animals to encourage nesting birds.|$|E
5|$|Wagga Wagga is {{upstream}} from the Riverina plain in the mid-catchment {{range of the}} Murrumbidgee River in an alluvial valley confined by low bedrock hills. Much of Wagga Wagga is on heavy clay soils in a large drainage basin with a small catchment discharge point. Groundwater therefore cannot leave easily, leading to Wagga Wagga having a problem with <b>waterlogged</b> soil and soil salination. Urban salination in Wagga Wagga is now {{the subject of a}} large multi-pronged approach to prevent further salination and reclaim salt-affected areas.|$|E
5|$|An earlier canal {{had been}} built in the Middle Ages to supply Glastonbury Abbey and the town with stone and produce. In the early 19th century a new canal was {{proposed}} to improve commerce in Glastonbury and help with drainage of the surrounding area of the Somerset Levels. Several alternative routes were considered and costed before obtaining an Act of Parliament and issuing a prospectus to raise funds for the building of the canal. Construction commenced in the 1820s; however it was more expensive than envisaged and further funds had to be raised. It finally opened in 1833 but was only prosperous for a short period. The shortfall in income and engineering problems with water supply and <b>waterlogged</b> peat causing the clay puddling to fracture meant that it was sold to the Bristol and Exeter Railway. They used the canal to transport materials for the construction of the new Somerset Central Railway which opened in 1854.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Pringle, {{who played}} in the First and Second Tests, none of the six new {{selections}} had played in the series so far, but the match followed the old pattern, as the England batting again failed twice against the hostile West Indies pace attack, only Lamb and Smith in the first innings and Gooch in the second offering much resistance. The side fell to a relatively facile defeat against a West Indies team whose own batsmen failed to dominate; they had no need. Curtly Ambrose secured his first man-of-the-match award for taking seven wickets {{at a cost of}} 98 runs - despite being hampered early on in the match, when a blocked drain resulted in the bowler's run-up area being <b>waterlogged</b> and in some places flooded with overflow rainwater, Ambrose being hapless bowler who was forced to bring the situation {{to the attention of the}} umpires so that play could be suspended and the playing area dried out.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2006–07 season, Gannon and Stockport announced they had drawn up a five-year plan to take the club to the Championship. Results on the field followed this statement of intent, with Gannon leading County to a League record nine consecutive victories without conceding a goal. Gannon lodged a complaint with The Football Association against Bristol Rovers when a fixture was postponed due to a <b>waterlogged</b> pitch, as he felt not enough was done to ready the pitch, and also a complaint with regard to the referee's handling of the situation. Gannon was later incensed with the FA when the same referee was allowed to take charge of the postponed fixture, which Rovers won 2–1. Gannon also branded approaches from Manchester City and Liverpool questionable and unprofessional after the two Premier League clubs swooped for youngsters being trained in Stockport County's development squads.|$|E
5|$|Construction was of crossed wooden poles, {{driven into}} the <b>waterlogged</b> soil to support a walkway that {{consisted}} mainly of planks of oak, laid end-to-end. The track was used {{for a period of}} only around ten years and was then abandoned, probably due to rising water levels. Following its discovery in 1970, most of the track has been left in its original location, with active conservation measures taken, including a water pumping and distribution system to maintain the wood in its damp condition. Some of the track is stored at the British Museum and at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. A reconstruction has been made on which visitors can walk, on the same line as the original in Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve.|$|E
5|$|His goals {{also helped}} Darlington reach {{the second round}} proper (last 32) of the 1919–20 FA Cup. Healey scored twice against Bishop Auckland in the fifth {{qualifying}} round, and repeated the feat in the sixth, as well as creating two for Aaron Travis, as Darlington beat Southern League club Norwich City 5–0. In the first round proper, Darlington faced Sheffield Wednesday of the First Division. A damaged shoulder meant Healey was unfit for the scheduled date, but a <b>waterlogged</b> Feethams pitch gave him an extra few days to recover. The match ended goalless; Healey was unusually indecisive in front of goal, and was standing in an offside position when Travis did put {{the ball in the}} net. Although reported doubtful for the replay, he did appear, pressuring goalkeeper Arnold Birch into conceding a corner from which Darlington took the lead– the goal variously attributed to George Stevens or to Healey himself. He missed the second-round tie at Birmingham because his wife was ill; Darlington lost 4–0.|$|E
5|$|In February 1953, Lympne was <b>waterlogged</b> and {{services}} were temporarily transferred to Southend. In September waterlogging again stopped the air ferry, which {{was transferred to}} RAF West Malling. Six Bristol Freighter Mk.32s were introduced in March 1953, {{at a cost of}} £540,000, which could each carry three cars and a service to Ostend was started with the aircraft. Skyways remained at Lympne until October 1954 when it moved to Lydd (Ferryfield). On 3 October 1954, the last Silver City flight to Le Touquet was operated by Bristol Freighter G-AIFV. Silver City moved to Lydd because the runway at Lympne was not suitable. Although it had campaigned for improvements to the runway and was Lympne's biggest customer the airfields owners, the Ministry of Civil Aviation, refused. Silver City said it would build an airport suitable for its needs at Lydd.|$|E
5|$|It has two {{landscaped}} picnic areas. Facilities {{include a}} tea shop, with {{indoor and outdoor}} seating areas {{with a view of}} the lake, and information centre. There are a souvenir shop and small art gallery and two nature trails. The Grebe Trail is a hard-surfaced, all-weather path suitable for pedestrians, pushchairs and wheelchairs and covers a circuit 0.75miles (1.2km) long, starting and finishing at the wooded picnic area. The Bittern Trail is reached from the Grebe Trail by the footbridge over Hollow Brook. The grassy path is often <b>waterlogged</b> in winter, but there is a boardwalk over a short section. The trail runs along the east shore, visits an open bird hide and returns to the footbridge, making a 1-mile (1.5-kilometre) circuit. Bristol Water imposes conditions on visitors, particularly related to the areas where dogs are allowed.|$|E
5|$|Most terns hunt fish by diving, often {{hovering}} first, and {{the particular}} approach technique used can help to distinguish similar species at a distance. Sea terns often hunt in association with porpoises or predatory fish, such as bluefish, tuna or bonitos, since these large marine animals drive the prey to the surface. Sooty terns feed at night as the fish rise to the surface, and are believed {{to sleep on the}} wing since they become <b>waterlogged</b> easily. Terns of several species will feed on invertebrates, following the plough or hunting on foot on mudflats. The marsh terns normally catch insects in the air or pick them off the surface of fresh water. Other species will sometimes use these techniques if the opportunity arises. An individual tern's foraging efficiency increases with its age.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{returned to}} the area in mid-July, tasked with minor operations intended to keep German {{attention away from the}} sector north of Ypres, which was to be the focus of renewed fighting as Haig continued with his planned offensive. Russell had his brigades man the division's section in rotation; those not in the trenches spent their time training. During this period, the New Zealanders captured the village of La Basseville but subsequently lost it to a German counterattack. At the end of the month, 2nd Wellington Battalion, 1st Brigade, retook the village with Lance-Corporal Leslie Andrew playing {{a key role in the}} action; he was later awarded the VC for his efforts. Over the following few weeks the men of the division worked to consolidate their positions in <b>waterlogged</b> trenches, rain having set in. Casualties were still incurred during this period including Brigadier General Johnston, killed by a sniper on 7 August while inspecting his new command, the Rifle Brigade.|$|E
5|$|The head is {{long and}} strong, with a convex profile and thick, long ears. The neck {{is long and}} the {{shoulders}} are sloping. The chest is broad and deep, the withers prominent, the back long and broad, and the hindquarters strong. The legs are well developed and powerful, with large joints. The Poitevin has large hooves, an advantage in wet environments, as an adaptation to the alternately hard and <b>waterlogged</b> marshes upon which it developed. The lower legs are well feathered, and the mane and tail are long and thick. The Poitevin is gentle, calm and robust. Historically the breed {{has been known for}} its slow movement and disinterest in pulling, although it can produce significant power if necessary. The breed enjoys human contact, and shows intelligence, although it can also be stubborn. Prolonged effort is its weak point, as the Poitevin sometimes lack endurance.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor {{it to the ground}} and gather water and {{nutrients}} to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch {{out of the side of}} this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently <b>waterlogged</b> soil.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of the School's operation, the {{character}} of the area had changed beyond recognition. Historically, Tottenham had consisted of four villages on Ermine Street (later the A10 road), surrounded by marshland and farmland. The construction of the Northern and Eastern Railway in 1840, with stations at Tottenham Hale and Marsh Lane (later Northumberland Park), made commuting from Tottenham to central London feasible for the first time (albeit by a circuitous eight-mile route via Stratford, more than double the distance of the direct road route), as well as providing direct connections to the Port of London. In 1872 the Great Eastern Railway opened a direct line from Enfield to Liverpool Street station, including a station at Bruce Grove, close to Bruce Castle; the railway provided subsidised workmen's fares to allow poor commuters to live in Tottenham and commute to work in central London. As a major rail hub, Tottenham grew into a significant residential and industrial area; {{by the end of the}} 19th century, the only remaining undeveloped areas were the grounds of Bruce Castle itself, and the <b>waterlogged</b> floodplains of the River Lea at Tottenham Marshes and of the River Moselle at Broadwater Farm.|$|E
5|$|Like all Tylopilus species, T.felleus is mycorrhizal. It {{is found}} in {{deciduous}} and coniferous woodland, often under beech and oak in well-drained acid soils, which can be sandy, gravelly or peaty. If encountered on calcareous (chalky) soil, {{it will be in}} moist areas that have become <b>waterlogged</b> and have ample leaf litter. Fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups, and occasionally in small clusters with two or three joined {{at the base of the}} stem. Fruit bodies have also been growing in the cavities of old trees, on old conifer stumps, or on buried rotten wood. The fungus obtains most of its nitrogen requirements from amino acids derived from the breakdown of proteins, although a lesser amount is obtained from the amino sugar glucosamine (a breakdown product of chitin, a major component of fungal cell walls). The mycorrhizal plant partner benefits from the fungus's ability to use these forms of nitrogen, which are often abundant in the forest floor. Fruit bodies appear over summer and autumn, anytime from June to October or even November, in many of the northern temperate zones. Large numbers may appear in some years, and none in others, generally proportional to the amount of rainfall. Variety uliginosus, known from Michigan, grows among lichens and mosses under pines.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{geological}} {{formation in the}} valley is the Supra-Pennant Measures of the Carboniferous period. It is a significant feature towards the north-eastern part of the area and {{is represented by the}} Pensford Syncline coal basin, which formed part of the Somerset coalfield. It is a complex formation containing coal seams and is made up of clay and shales. The landscape is typically undulating and includes outcrops of sandstone. Most of the area around Stanton Drew have neutral to acid red loamy soils with slowly permeable subsoils. Soils to {{the eastern part of the}} area are slowly permeable clayey and fine silty soils. They are found on Carboniferous clay and shales typical of the Supra-Pennant Measures. They are frequently <b>waterlogged</b> where the topography dictates. They tend towards being acid and are brown to grey brown in colour. In the south and south east of the area there are coal measures which are sufficiently near the surface for coal mining to have taken place around Clutton and High Littleton. In the eastern area of the valley as the River Chew flows through Publow, Woollard and Compton Dando before joining the River Avon at Keynsham there are alluvial deposits of clay soils.|$|E
5|$|The {{western end}} of the area (around Nempnett Thrubwell) {{consists}} of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified clay, shale and Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous period, {{is found in the}} adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high iron content. The clay content means that where unimproved they easily become <b>waterlogged</b> when wet, and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods. The main geological outcrops around the lake are Mudstone, largely consisting of red Siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of Sandstone of the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres (250–770ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the Jurassic period found on the higher ground around Maes Knoll. This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their geological interest including Barns Batch Spinney, Hartcliff Rocks Quarry and Dundry Main Road South Quarry.|$|E

25|$|The eighth {{match of}} the series, {{scheduled}} for 26 October 1994, was abandoned {{due to a}} <b>waterlogged</b> pitch. However, the teams {{took part in a}} 15 over exhibition match, in which Pakistan beat Australia by 4 wickets.|$|E
25|$|<b>Waterlogged</b> roots {{can also}} cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts, {{possibly}} due to less sucrose being exported out of the chloroplast (or more accurately, the plant cell). This depletes a plant's free phosphate supply, which indirectly stimulates chloroplast starch synthesis.|$|E
25|$|The 1972 {{excavations}} reached layers {{that had}} remained <b>waterlogged</b> and had preserved items {{that otherwise would}} have been destroyed. These include a twisted skein of Heather, one of a very few known examples of Neolithic rope, and a wooden handle.|$|E
25|$|Nepenthes distillatoria is {{endemic to}} Sri Lanka {{and is the}} only Nepenthes species {{recorded}} from the island. It grows in <b>waterlogged</b> open scrub, along road embankments and other cleared areas, and in forest. N.distillatoria occurs from sea-level to 700 m altitude.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the winter}} of 1965, Epsom College was unusual in holding {{athletics}} in the coldest months of the year, between January and April. This meant that the long jump pit was often frozen. The track surrounded the First XV pitch, and was either frozen or <b>waterlogged.</b>|$|E
