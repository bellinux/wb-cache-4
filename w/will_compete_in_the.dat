25|$|In 2011 he was {{announced}} {{as a member}} of the Italian side that <b>will</b> <b>compete</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2013 World Cup qualifying. After consistent form in a struggling Roosters side, Minichiello received an Origin call-up for Game 2 of the 2011 State of Origin series.

Minichiello's experience in the young Blues backline proved valuable as he scored the match-winner for New South Wales after Five-eight Jamie Soward dazzled the Queensland defence. The Blues won 18–8, largely due to the experienced combination of Minichiello and Ricky Stuart, who was back coaching New South Wales after five years out of the side. In Round 16 of the NRL season, he scored his 105th try against the Newcastle Knights, making him the all-time leading try-scorer for the Roosters, breaking the record of 104 previously held by Bill Mullins (1968–78).|$|E
