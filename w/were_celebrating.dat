5|$|As {{the crowd}} began {{making their way}} home from Ninian Park, the news began to filter slowly out. Some Scottish fans had elected to remain in Cardiff and <b>were</b> <b>celebrating</b> the {{achievement}} of guaranteeing the play-off spot when they saw and heard what had happened. Others had boarded trains or were in cars heading home – many fans didn't hear the news until they eventually got home the following day.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the treaty}} was signed, German {{soldiers}} had already entered {{the port of}} Klaipėda. Adolf Hitler, on board the cruiser Deutschland, personally toured the city and gave a short speech. The armada sailing to Klaipėda included the cruiser Admiral Graf Spee, the light cruisers Nürnberg, Leipzig, and Köln, two destroyer squadrons, three torpedo boat flotillas, and one tender flotilla. At the time the Lithuanian navy had only one warship, the Prezidentas Smetona, a 580-ton converted minesweeper. While the Germans <b>were</b> <b>celebrating</b> {{the return of the}} city, European politicians expressed fears that the Free City of Danzig would be Hitler's next target.|$|E
5|$|Ivanović {{had left}} Vienna in 1840 {{and gone to}} study at the Munich Academy, {{possibly}} owing to Czacki's further generosity. Subsequent statements suggest that Ivanović was inspired to paint The Conquest of Belgrade around this time. Writing in 1873, she recalled how the painting came about: While studying at the Munich Academy, I started to read History of the Serb People. I wanted to paint the brave battle of Mirko on my canvas. With seven of his comrades he succeeded in entering the city at night while the Muslims <b>were</b> <b>celebrating</b> Bajram (Eid al-Fitr) and didn't even think about any danger. Mirko and his comrades killed the guards at the town gate. Their rifle shots were the signal for the others. Ivanović soon travelled to Belgrade, visited the battlesite, conversed {{with some of the}} participants in Belgrade's capture, and examined period clothing and weaponry used in the battle. She created the composition in 1844–45; it was painted in Belgrade.|$|E

5|$|The Persian army {{seems to}} have made slow {{progress}} through Thrace and Macedon. News of the imminent Persian approach eventually reached Greece in August thanks to a Greek spy. At {{this time of year}} the Spartans, de facto military leaders of the alliance, <b>were</b> <b>celebrating</b> the festival of Carneia. During the Carneia, military activity was forbidden by Spartan law; the Spartans had arrived too late at the Battle of Marathon because of this requirement. It was also the time of the Olympic Games, and therefore the Olympic truce, and thus it would have been doubly sacrilegious for the whole Spartan army to march to war. On this occasion, the ephors decided the urgency was sufficiently great to justify an advance expedition to block the pass, under one of its kings, Leonidas I. Leonidas took with him the 300 men of the royal bodyguard, the Hippeis. This expedition was to try to gather as many other Greek soldiers along the way as possible and to await the arrival of the main Spartan army.|$|E

25|$|In 1218, the Alawites of the {{mountains}} near Latakia and Baniyas appealed to al-Makzun {{to assist them in}} their struggles against the Nizari Ismaili Shias, who controlled an extensive network of fortresses in these mountains, and the Kurdish military settlers brought to the region by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin. A massacre of Alawites in the Sahyun fortress while they <b>were</b> <b>celebrating</b> Nowruz prompted al-Makzun to lead a 25,000-strong expedition from Sinjar to relieve the Alawites. This first campaign reportedly ended with a defeat against the Kurdish and Ismaili forces.|$|E
25|$|In 1662, {{after the}} {{restoration}} of the monarchy, in revenge for the support Coventry gave to the Parliamentarians during the Civil War, the city walls were demolished on the orders of King Charles II and now only a few short sections and two city gatehouses remain.

25|$|Although {{in general}} the Romans {{regarded}} marriage as a male-female union {{for the purpose of}} producing children, a few scholars believe that in the early Imperial period some male couples <b>were</b> <b>celebrating</b> traditional marriage rites in the presence of friends. Male-male weddings are reported by sources that mock them; the feelings of the participants are not recorded. Both Martial and Juvenal refer to marriage between males as something that occurs not infrequently, although they disapprove of it. Roman law did not recognize marriage between males, but one of the grounds for disapproval expressed in Juvenal's satire is that celebrating the rites would lead to expectations for such marriages to be registered officially. As the empire was becoming Christianized in the 4th century, legal prohibitions against marriage between males began to appear.|$|E
25|$|The {{series was}} set {{at a time of}} change in the fashion of the {{so-called}} traditional British holiday. During the years after the Second World War, British holiday camps flourished, as people <b>were</b> <b>celebrating</b> with fun and laughter again after years of austerity and wartime hardship. The series was set towards the end of this period, when the original format of holiday camps was coming to an end. Despite the feeling amongst many staff that their brand of fun and entertainment for the whole family was a tradition that would endure, the emerging popularity at the time (late 1950s / early 1960s) for self-catering and holidaying abroad meant the camp was unlikely to survive in its original format. The closing storyline of the series was the camp undergoing drastic changes to modernise with the times, meaning that many of the staff would lose their jobs as their particular talents were no longer required.|$|E
25|$|On 27 November 2013, the occupying {{students}} filmed two professors from Sofia University who <b>were</b> <b>celebrating</b> {{a birthday}} and the conferral of a professorship while drinking alcohol {{on the premises}} of the university (outside working hours). While some commentators were critical of the academics for setting a bad example and possibly violating university policies, others condemned the students for going overboard in their desire to pontificate about morality and for supposedly being motivated by revanchism (because the two professors had publicly opposed the occupation). Ivaylo Dinev, {{one of the leading}} figures behind the first occupation, later regretted the decision to make the clip available to the general public, calling it a strategic and moral mistake, as it shifted the focus of the wider society on a relatively unimportant issue, caused the student protesters to lose some outside support, and created friction within the ranks of the occupying students themselves. He also acknowledged that drinking alcohol (by both students and academics) during special occasions had always been regarded as being compatible with the ethos of the university.|$|E

Through the alliance it formed with the anti-Bolshevik Czechoslovak Legions, it was a Romanian national contribution to the international coalition, but reluctantly so. Once relocated to Irkutsk and Omsk in late 1918, the volunteers expressed their lack of interest in fighting against the Bolsheviks: after rebelling against Colonel Kadlec, their Czech technical adviser, the Corps was placed under Maurice Janin of the French Mission.|$|E
