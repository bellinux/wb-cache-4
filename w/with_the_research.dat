5|$|From 1940 to 1943, Nosaka's {{presence}} in China was kept a secret. Under a Chinese name, Lin Zhe, he directed {{the work of}} the Research Office of the Japanese Problem. His work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Research</b> Office in Yan'an brought Yan'an's intelligence information about Japan up to date. Nosaka collected newspapers and other publications from Japan. To research the enemy, Nosaka and his crew took care to analyze current events in Japan and China, which they did by stocking Japanese newspapers, magazines, journals, and diaries that were purchased or seized on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|General Martin Perez (Dan Hedaya) is the {{commanding}} officer of the USM Auriga, overseeing the ship's legal (and illicit) activities. After Ripley 8 is cloned and her Queen embryo is extracted, Perez is uneasy with her enhanced physical and psychological abilities but allows her to live; Dr. Wren and Dr. Gediman continue their research on her. Perez hires Elgyn to abduct a number of humans in cryostasis as incubators for the cloned Aliens; he gives the Betty crew food and lodging, emphasizing that they cannot interfere <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> on the Auriga. When the Aliens board an escape craft, he sabotages them with a grenade. An Alien bites the back of Perez' head, exposing his brain.|$|E

Unbeknownst to Scully, Gill tampers with her pregnancy medications. Meanwhile, Billy Miles (Zachary Aynsley), satisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> conducted at Zeus Genetics in Germantown, kills the head scientist, Dr. Lev, and burns the laboratory. All of the evidence at Zeus Genetics is destroyed, including the viable hybrid fetus. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) informs John Doggett (Robert Patrick) of the fire at Zeus Genetics, and asks to go along to survey the crime scene. Mulder reveals that Dr. Lev is connected to Scully's former obstetrician, Dr. Parenti. While searching Dr. Parenti's office, the agents find another storage room containing hybrid fetuses. They confront Dr. Parenti, who denies everything.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, {{the journal}} Zoologica {{was founded by}} Osborn and Hornaday {{specifically}} as a place for Beebe to publish his research. The first {{issue of the journal}} contained twenty papers, ten of which were written by Beebe, and two more of which were jointly written by him and Lee Saunders Crandall, the zoo's assistant curator of birds. The following year Beebe received a promotion from the Zoological Society, placing him on equal footing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> scientists at the Museum of Natural History. This promotion explicitly granted him two months off each year, for the purpose of further research expeditions. The first expedition conducted under his new privileges, beginning in February 1908, took him to Trinidad and Venezuela to research birds and insects. During this expedition Beebe captured 40 live birds for the zoo, belonging to 14 different species.|$|E
5|$|While Final Fantasy XIII was in production, the {{development}} of Crystal Tools caused significant problems and delays. The programmers spent much time on taking all demands from staff into account. Based on this feedback, Murata's team tried to adapt the engine {{to the needs of}} several game projects, which proved to be virtually impossible and prevented the engine's specifications from being finalized. Furthermore, as separate groups were working on the individual tools of the engine, there was no comprehensive software documentation to ensure usability and compliance. Unable to wait any longer, the Final Fantasy XIII team {{had no choice but to}} begin creating assets to keep to the game's production schedule. However, the lack of specifications resulted in these assets being incompatible with the engine. In the end, it was decided that Final Fantasy XIII was to be the principal focus of Crystal Tools and the game's team began cooperating <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Research</b> and Development Division more closely to receive the required tools and specifications. While preliminary support of Crystal Tools was developed for the Wii, the console did not fully support all components. In 2008, Murata said that Square Enix might license the engine out to other companies at some point in the future, although the limited documentation and the impracticality of supporting licensees posed great problems in doing so. Two years later, Final Fantasy XIII producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that developing an engine from scratch to go with a new game may have been a mistake and a likely cause for the long period between the title's announcement and release.|$|E
