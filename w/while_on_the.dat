5|$|After calling at Balestrand, Kommandøren {{proceeded}} to Leikanger, where the soldiers on board disembarked. While Kommandøren was docked at Leikanger, {{the village was}} attacked by a German aircraft. The aircraft dropped 11 bombs in three series on the area, before strafing people and cars on the ground. Amongst the targets were the soldiers unloaded by Kommandøren, the troops being on the march to nearby Hermansverk. The attack killed a travelling salesman from Bergen outright, and wounded a 16-year-old local boy and the boy's mother, restaurateur Isak Roksvåg from Kommandøren and the ship's captain, Thorvald Johannessen. <b>While</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way to hospital in Lærdal with Kommandøren, Captain Johannessen died from his wounds.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Muhammad in 632, Muslim {{leadership}} passed to Caliph Abu Bakr following a series of campaigns known as the Ridda Wars. Once Bakr's sovereignty over Arabia had been secured, he initiated a war of conquest in the east by invading Iraq, then a province of the Sassanid Persian Empire; <b>while</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western front, his armies invaded the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|After this, SR75 {{passes through}} the United States Naval Amphibious Base for a few miles before {{entering}} downtown Coronado. The highway becomes Orange Avenue and turns north-northeast as the main street through Coronado. SR75 intersects SR 282 at the one-way couplet of Third and Fourth Streets; SR282 continues west on Third Street and returns to SR75 on Fourth Street, while SR75 continues east on Fourth Street and heads west towards Orange Avenue on Third Street. The one-way couplet is brief, and SR75 becomes a divided highway before crossing the Coronado Bridge. <b>While</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bridge, SR75 crosses into the city of San Diego again.|$|E
5|$|All but {{a handful}} of Supreme Court justices have been married. Frank Murphy, Benjamin Cardozo, and James McReynolds were all lifelong bachelors. In addition, retired justice David Souter and current justice Elena Kagan have never been married. William O. Douglas was the first Justice to divorce <b>while</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Court, and also had the most marriages of any Justice, with four. Justice John Paul Stevens {{divorced}} his first wife in 1979, marrying his second wife later that year. Sonia Sotomayor was the first female justice to be appointed as an unmarried woman, having divorced in 1983, long before her nomination in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Although dragonflies are {{swift and}} agile fliers, some predators are {{fast enough to}} catch them. These include falcons such as the American kestrel, the merlin, and the hobby; nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers and {{swallows}} also take some adults; some species of wasps, too, prey on dragonflies, using them to provision their nests, laying an egg on each captured insect. In the water, various species of ducks and herons eat dragonfly larvae and they are also preyed on by newts, frogs, fish, and water spiders. Amur falcons, which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that coincides with the migration of the globe skimmer dragonfly, Pantala flavescens, may actually be feeding on them <b>while</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wing.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the British visit, the 1905 autumn {{maneuvers}} were shortened considerably, from 6 to 13 September, and consisted only of exercises in the North Sea. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight, and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe. During October, Kaiser Wilhelm II conducted individual training and, in November, joined the rest of the I Squadron for a cruise in the Baltic. In early December, the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December. <b>While</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> return trip to Kiel, the fleet conducted tactical exercises.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on the {{airplane}} to Berlin, flashbacks are interlaced throughout the episode, illustrating the tensions caused by Eli's frequent absence during Ziva's adolescence and the disintegration of Rivka (Weronika Rosati) and Eli David's marriage. Also <b>while</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plane, Ziva explains her rationale for changing their destination: her father had told her to convert all funds to diamonds with a dealer in Berlin should she ever need to go into hiding. She assumes {{that he would have}} given Bodnar, who he viewed as a son, the same advice.|$|E

Despite being placed on the 15-day DL with a strained right hamstring and missing the final six {{weeks of the season}} with a lower back injury, he led the team in stolen bases, with 17. On August 30, <b>while</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> DL with a back injury, he was ticketed for speeding in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. After being stopped, he refused the ticket and sped away. He pleaded not guilty to speeding and fleeing charges on September 12, but was sentenced to a three-day jail term. The ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court of Ohio in December 2004.|$|E
5|$|Capaldi's actions {{received}} favourable {{coverage from}} the Autism Daily Newscast, an official Google News website reporting on current events and news {{of interest to}} those on the autism spectrum, with site journalist Jo Worgan noting that the actor had devoted himself <b>while</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set of Doctor Who to spending time with an autistic girl who was {{a fan of the}} show. The Hollywood Reporter noted that the Time Lord character took time to support the mental well-being of a child in addition to his duties of protecting the universe from harm.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Rewa {{started to}} affect New Caledonia on 5January, before it passed over Grand Terre Island later that day. Rewa dumped over 300mm (12in) of rain on {{parts of the}} archipelago, which made {{all of the major}} rivers {{overflow}} and burst their banks. Several landslides and a death were recorded within New Caledonia, <b>while</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Loyalty Island of Mare, waves from Rewa partially destroyed the harbour wall at Tadine's port.|$|E

5|$|De-icers spray heated {{de-icing}} fluid, often {{propylene glycol}} or ethylene glycol, onto icy surfaces {{such as the}} bodies of aircraft and road surfaces. These prevent ice from forming {{on the body of}} the aircraft <b>while</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the amount of lift they provide while increasing drag. The ice also increases the weight of the aircraft and can affect its balance.|$|E
5|$|During {{the filming}} and {{promotion}} of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo {{went to great lengths}} to avoid showing their faces. <b>While</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview. During this interview they noted that the use of cloth bags in particular had been a spontaneous decision, reflecting their willingness to experiment with their perceived image in the media.|$|E
5|$|Each Province is a two-sided {{interchangeable}} board, on {{one side}} of which is a Harbinger's province <b>while</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other are the sewers. The Provinces can be assembled in any order, which can allow different game experiences when the Provinces are changed. Each Province has its own headstone and is in the Harbinger's colours. Both sides of the Province board have paths used by the players to move around the board. Located along the paths are the six Keystones for that colour Province, and three different game symbols: the black holes, the lighting bolts and the compasses.|$|E
