Referring to Grey's tampering with Shepherd's trial, Pompeo said: [...] "Listen, what Meredith did clearly crossed a line. Derek has a right to be pissed." [...] Following the tampering, Rhimes said she believes that Grey and Shepherd are meant to be together and that it in the end, they will end up with each other. Grey's relationship with Cristina Yang, has been looked upon as [...] "sisterhood", and Yang has repeatedly referred to Grey as [...] "her person". This led to the two being dubbed [...] "the twisted sisters". At the conclusion of season three, the duo went on a [...] "honeymoon" [...] together, and Rhimes called it her favorite detail of the finale. Grey has been characterized, by some, as [...] "whiny". Rhimes offered her insight: ...|$|E

Canadian film-maker Zach Math comments that the American, Tom Mitchell, [...] "is an ordinary guy but he has this quirk where he thinks of his penis as a separate entity from his body— Elmo. He has this dream that he <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the most famous penis in the world."

He says that [...] "I've always thought it'd be really cool for my penis to be the first true penis celebrity" [...] and has made it the star of its own comic book, Elmo: Adventures of a Superhero Penis.|$|E
500|$|Joseph R. Atilano of Inquirer Entertainment praised [...] "Circles" [...] {{as one of}} the catchiest {{songs of}} the album and {{compared}} the track to songs by Rihanna and Nicki Minaj. Kitty Empire of The Observer commented that the [...] "sing-song verse is redolent of Rihanna". Montreal Gazette editor T'cha Dunlevy simply described it as [...] "a raunchy flip of the bird to haters". HitFix writer Melinda Newman called it a [...] "shape-shifting" [...] and compared Aguilera to Gwen Stefani [...] "as she adopts a patois". Annie Zaleschi of The A.V. Club was mixed, naming it a [...] "bitter '90s alt-rock crossed with M.I.A.'s antagonistic attitude; it should be an angry kiss-off. Instead, cringe-inducing lyrics sap its ire". For Michael Gallucci of PopCrush, the song [...] "dips back to the bubblegum pop of Aguilera's debut for the verses, but pumps a ton of distortion into her voice during the refrains. 'Circles' doesn't seem to know what kind of song it <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> so it settles for two not very good ones".|$|E

Woods Bagot won a competition for the architect firm which would design the facility. The proposed site consists of two parcels of land on opposite sides of a highway leading to Baiyun Airport; both sites are shaped like wings. The site will have a bridge and light rail system that operates above the highway to connect the two parcels, which will each have distinct functions. For instance, the east parcel will house internal functions such as the data center facilities, staff dormitories, and the training center. The airline <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aesthetically pleasing from the air since it sits below a runway approach. The site will have a lot of outdoor space, which Woods Bagot designed along with Hargreaves Associates and Sherwood Design Engineers.
