5|$|Petre Vasiliu-Năsturel {{observes that}} from a heraldic point of view, on the French {{as well as the}} revolutionary Wallachian flag, the middle stripe {{represents}} a heraldic metal (argent and or respectively). Other writers believe that the tricolor was not an imitation of the French flag, instead embodying an old Romanian tradition. This theory is supported by a note from the revolutionary foreign minister to Emin Pasha: “the colors of the band that we the leaders wear, as well as all our followers, are not of modern origin. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> our flags since an earlier time. When we received the tricolor insignia and bands we did not follow the spirit of imitation or fashion”.|$|E
5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E

500|$|When it {{was first}} {{released}} in 1941, Ellen Buell of The New York Times called the book [...] "one of the merriest <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> in a long time", praising the understated comedic aspect of the procession down Beacon Street, as well as McCloskey's [...] "fine large pictures" [...] which simultaneously demonstrate [...] "economy of line" [...] and [...] "wealth of detail".|$|E

500|$|In October 2012, Hedren {{said that}} {{although}} she believed the film accurately portrays Hitchcock's negative behaviour towards her, the time constraints of a 90-minute film prevented telling the entire story of her career with him. She told television critic Rob Salem, [...] "It wasn't a constant barrage of harassment. If it had been constantly the way <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{to do it in}} this film, I would have been long gone".|$|E

500|$|Bookmakers {{estimated}} that over £1million {{would be spent}} gambling {{on the outcome of}} the storyline. Ladbrokes experienced its busiest ever 24 hours of gambling on a television series ahead of the episode's transmission, taking £100,000 in bets on 30 different characters, while William Hill took £500,000, surpassing the amount placed on Dallas Who shot J. R.? storyline in 1980. Spokesman Rupert Adams commented: [...] "The BBC were amazing keeping this quiet.

500|$|When, in September 1943, Joseph Goebbels was {{informed}} that the German army had {{to withdraw from the}} Katyn area, he wrote a prediction in his diary. His entry for 29 September 1943 reads: [...] "Unfortunately <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to give up Katyn. The Bolsheviks undoubtedly will soon 'find' that we shot 12,000 Polish officers. That episode is one that is going to cause us quite a little trouble in the future.

500|$|He {{continued}} to socialize and {{keep up with}} his correspondence well into his seventies, and his fame and popularity {{continued to}} soar. [...] "I don't believe that any man, in any country, has ever had a more affectionate admiration for him than that given to you in America", wrote Senator William C. Preston {{in a letter to}} Irving. [...] "I believe that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> but one man who is so much in the popular heart".

500|$|Lawrence Tierney guest {{starred in}} the episode as Don Brodka. Another former show runner, Josh Weinstein, called Tierney's {{appearance}} [...] "the craziest guest star experience we ever had". In addition to yelling at and intimidating employees of the show, Tierney made unreasonable requests, such as abandoning his distinctive voice to do the part in a southern accent and refusing to perform lines {{if he did not}} [...] "get the jokes". Despite this, Oakley and Weinstein thought Tierney did a good job. Weinstein said, [...] "He certainly delivered and he's one of my favorite characters <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> [...]" [...] After Tierney's death, the episode [...] "The Old Man and the Key" [...] was dedicated to him.|$|E
