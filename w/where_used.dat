5|$|GTAW welding torches are {{designed}} for either automatic or manual operation and are equipped with cooling systems using air or water. The automatic and manual torches are similar in construction, but the manual torch has a handle while the automatic torch normally comes with a mounting rack. The angle between the centerline of the handle and the centerline of the tungsten electrode, known as the head angle, can be varied on some manual torches according to the preference of the operator. Air cooling systems are most often used for low-current operations (up to about 200A), while water cooling is required for high-current welding (up to about 600A). The torches are connected with cables to the power supply and with hoses to the shielding gas source and <b>where</b> <b>used,</b> the water supply.|$|E
5|$|The chapel was {{dedicated}} to Our Lady of Sorrows (also called the Madonna di Pietà or Mater Dolorosa). After being deconsecrated in the late 19th century, the room was used for other purposes, and only the limestone frame, <b>where</b> <b>used</b> to be the titular painting which was retrieved during restoration works in 1991, still remains from the chapel's original interior. An ornate fountain {{is located at the}} building's main courtyard, above which is a niche with a statue and above it an elaborate sculpture of the coat-of-arms of Pinto. Similar to the fountain of the first Castellania on site, it was supplied by water from the aqueduct.|$|E

25|$|PTFE {{is used as}} a {{non-stick}} coating for pans and other cookware. It is non-reactive, partly because of the strength of carbon–fluorine bonds, and so it is often used in containers and pipework for reactive and corrosive chemicals. <b>Where</b> <b>used</b> as a lubricant, PTFE reduces friction, wear and energy consumption of machinery. It is commonly used as a graft material in surgical interventions. Also, it is frequently employed as coating on catheters; this interferes with the ability of bacteria and other infectious agents to adhere to catheters and cause hospital-acquired infections.|$|E

25|$|In most of Continental Europe, {{the default}} rule {{is to give}} {{priority}} to the right, but this may be overridden by signs or road markings. There, priority was initially given according to the social rank of each traveler, but early {{in the life of}} the automobile this rule was deemed impractical and replaced with the priorité à droite (priority to the right) rule, which still applies. At a traffic circle where priorité à droite is not overridden, traffic on what would otherwise be a roundabout gives way to traffic entering the circle. Most French roundabouts now have give-way signs for traffic entering the circle, but there remain some notable exceptions that operate on the old rule, such as the Place de l'Étoile around the Arc de Triomphe. Priority to the right <b>where</b> <b>used</b> in continental Europe may be overridden by an ascending hierarchy of markings, signs, signals, and authorized persons.|$|E

2500|$|Numismatics is {{the study}} or {{collection}} of currency, [...] including coins, tokens, paper money, and related objects.

The Kyrgyz people used horses as the principal currency unit and gave small change in lambskins; the lambskins may be suitable for numismatic study, but the horses are not.

2500|$|To {{determine}} which locomotives would be suitable, the directors organised the Rainhill Trials. These were arranged as an open contest {{that would let}} them see all the locomotive candidates in action, with the choice to follow. A prize of £500 was offered to {{the winner of the}} trials. The trials were won by Rocket, built by George and Robert Stephenson. Rocket was the first locomotive to use a multi-tubular boiler, which allowed more effective heat transfer from the exhaust gases to the water. It was also the first to use a blastpipe, <b>where</b> <b>used</b> steam from the cylinders discharges into the smokebox beneath the chimney in order to increase the draught of the fire. With these innovations, Rocket averaged , with a top speed of [...] hauling 13 tons, and was declared the winner of the trials. The Stephensons were accordingly given the contract to produce locomotives for the Liverpool & Manchester Railway.|$|E
