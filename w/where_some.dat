5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, <b>where</b> <b>some</b> (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E

5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} is {{a mutually}} beneficial association between individuals of two species, where one (the cleaner) removes and eats parasites {{and other materials}} {{from the surface of}} the other (the client).

Other cleaning symbioses exist between birds and mammals, and in other groups.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the closure}} of the district's mines, the Wells Fargo office was used as a {{residence}} by Alex and Mayme Colbath until the 1950s.

The Cosmopolitan Restaurant was reconstructed to appear {{as it did in the}} 19th century, and it served European cuisine until it was closed in 2010. There are many remnants of houses and other buildings, and there are also markers indicating <b>where</b> <b>some</b> buildings once stood, such as the Elk Horn Saloon. Some of the area has been preserved for its history.|$|E
