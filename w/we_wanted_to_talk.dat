This album was talking to them in a way. Metaphorically, we feel like the universe gives you what you want, and we feel like we’re blessed by the universe, ‘cause we’re strong enough to ask and do {{what we need to do}} to make things happen. We feel like the universe works for you. Not to be corny, but you gotta believe it to see it. That’s why the cover is this little kid with a slingshot that just took down a helicopter, you know? It’s about seeing is believing. That’s what ¡MAYDAY! is. When you see us, you believe us. We turn people on all the time." [...] In the same interview, they spoke about the inspiration behind the song [...] "Marathon Man", saying: [...] "We have a song called “Marathon Man” inspired by the Boston bombing. Instead of a preachy gotta-save-the-world record, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it because it was crazy event so we wanted to do a story on it when you’re in the race.

[...] "Thank You" [...] is a pop rap and teen pop song with a length of three minutes and forty-nine seconds. It is written in the key of B major.

Lanois described the song's origins: [...] "We wanted to have something euphoric and Bono came up with that little melody. And he loved that melody, and stuck with it. Almost like a fanfare. And then I was involved in the lyrical process on that, because <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about sacrifice that one makes for one's medium or one's art.

5000|$|Dear citizens, {{ever since}} the mid-1980s when gender-equality issues came into public awareness, our country has been {{focusing}} on overhauling laws, policies and social systems to improve women’s rights and status. We have our first female president. More women pass major government service exams than men. Female ROTCs command conscripted male soldiers. Women surpassed men in university entrance rates and youth employment rates years ago. Despite this, men are still seen as superior while women are seen are [...] "socially weak".Dear citizens, While everyone else was {{speaking on behalf of}} women, Man of Korea started to speak for men. We began our group online in January 2008, and launched a formal civic group in March 2011. We have been treading a thorny path filled with mockery and ridicule. When we said excessive privileges for women should be distributed to men too, we were called male chauvinists. When we said men and women should share equal expenses and we should create an environment where men can also be house husbands, we were called losers. In this country, where discussing male rights is considered to be cheap gossip for losers and you have to discuss national politics to be taken seriously, Man of Korea has been marginalized.We {{would like to say that}} men can also be weak. We wanted to point out that if the gender you were born with determines your rights, privileges and duties, we will never achieve equality. We wanted to say that it is important to create a society where men and women stand on an equal footing and can understand and respect each other. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about the equality of every human beyond gender equality.|$|E

40|$|In {{the late}} 1990 s, we, Bronwyn Fredericks and Pamela Croft were both {{living in the}} Australian Central Queensland region. As two Australian Aboriginal women we were both engaged in the same areas of {{politics}} and activism and were both undertaking doctoral studies. At times during our studies, we would become frustrated {{with the lack of}} literature and scholarly leadership in our respective disciplines. We also knew we had lots to say that was inside and outside of the scope of our studies and our disciplines. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about history, health, education, culture, the manifestations of whiteness in Australia, the relationships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians and much more. Through our joint history we knew we could work in a partnership with each other in ways that supported and respected one another and recognised each other’s skills and abilities. We began to share our visions and our ideas in ways that stimulated creativity and inspiration. We began to plan projects using Pamela’s art works and Bronwyn’s words. We came to find a space in which we could jointly work. This paper will share part of our visioning journey and highlight some of the aspects of how we work together in our creative partnership. It will demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} enact our visions and to realise our dreams and aspirations...|$|E
40|$|This item {{includes}} {{a segment of}} a student interview in a Writing Intensive course in Nursing at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. The interview was conducted in 2014, and in this clip the interviewee is responding to the question 'How {{would you describe the}} classroom dynamics?'Brief excerpt from interview: It was an integrated course online {{as well as in the}} classroom. We met in class once a month and then other than that it was an online course. I enjoyed it because our nursing and the clinical hours we had to put in gave us the ability to work the classes around our schedules, so I enjoyed it. In the nursing courses they kind of mold us into being self-learners so with the online courses it promotes that. We had the opportunity to meet in class with the Blackboard collaborate software and then if we couldn't make it it wasn't required for all of us to be there because everyone knew that our schedules were different. What was nice was that they were able to record the session so we could watch it at any time but that also allowed for us to if we had questions <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the teacher directly about while we didn't have in-class sessions, we could make sure to go online at that time. Meeting with people, we were able to kind of collaborate and meet with each other and be able to talk to them live. Those were actually fun. We got to do a lot of group exercises... we had a group project where we had to present our project together so for us who have a hard time meeting with people we were able to kind of collaborate... We had to write. We had to kind of do an outline of what we wanted to present and then from that we made a powerpoint, and with the powerpoint we had to write what we were going to say... writing was involved in order to present a good presentation. With the nursing courses, we had several different cohorts in the class so you could tell who was in which cohort because they tended to stay together. I myself came with a cohort from KCC. I had graduated from Kapiolani Community College... we were close... and other students from the UH cohort... stayed together. ...|$|E

40|$|From {{the point}} of view of public finance research, this book is a little quaint. A typical court of audit judges only what is put before it.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{application}} of Concurrent Fuzzy Prolog (ConFuP) [10, 9] {{in the field of}} modeling flexible manufacturing systems. ConFuP offers the feasibility of concurrent process modeling through a set of descriptive rules based on uncertain or qualitative knowledge and enables the user to model hierarchical descriptions from a physical point of view (e. g. machines, tools, etc.) as well as from a logical one, where processes and machine states are described. Time considerations, modeling of alternative decisions and concurrency /synchronization are also supported by ConFuP. With fuzzy data types and operators (fuzzy sets, fuzzification, defuzzification) the formulation of different kinds of uncertainty is possible. System calls for different fuzzy operators, methods and strategies allow maximum flexibility. 1 Introduction Process modeling is (besides data modeling) {{one of the most important}} aspects in the CIMframework.
