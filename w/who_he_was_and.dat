Himmler {{was taken to}} the headquarters of the Second British Army in Lüneburg, where Doctor Wells conducted a medical exam on him. The doctor attempted to examine the inside of Himmler's mouth, but the prisoner was reluctant to open it and jerked his head away. Himmler then bit into a hidden cyanide pill and collapsed onto the floor. He was dead within 15 minutes. Shortly afterward, Himmler's body was buried in an unmarked grave near Lüneburg. The grave's location remains unknown.|$|E

25|$|After {{the action}} for which Whirlpool later {{received}} the Victoria Cross, he was hospitalised in Jhansi. Surviving despite considerable odds, {{he was considered}} too injured {{to remain in the}} military and as a result was discharged prior to receiving his award. He was granted a pension and subsequently migrated to Australia. In 1859 he landed in Victoria and he began looking for work. He was employed briefly as a school teacher, and he applied unsuccessfully to join the police. Later he joined the Hawthorne and Kew Volunteer Rifles, assuming a different name. Eventually a drill instructor discovered <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> in June 1861, in front of 2,000 people, in the uniform of his new regiment, Whirlpool reluctantly received his medal.|$|E
25|$|The curious {{personal}} {{character of}} La Fontaine, {{like that of}} some other men of letters, has been enshrined {{in a kind of}} legend by literary tradition. At an early age his absence of mind and indifference to business gave a subject to Gédéon Tallemant des Réaux. His later contemporaries helped to swell the tale, and the 18th century finally accepted it, including the anecdotes of his meeting his son, being told <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> remarking, Ah, yes, I thought I had seen him somewhere!, of his insisting on fighting a duel with a supposed admirer of his wife, and then imploring him to visit at his house just as before; of his going into company with his stockings wrong side out, , with, for a contrast, those of his awkwardness and silence, if not positive rudeness in company.|$|E

25|$|The {{legacy of}} Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara (June 14, 1928 – October 9, 1967) is {{constantly}} evolving {{in the collective}} imagination. As a ubiquitous symbol of counterculture worldwide, Guevara {{is one of the}} most recognizable and influential revolutionary figures of the twentieth century. However, during his life, and even more since his death, Che has elicited controversy and wildly divergent opinions as to <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> what he represented. Mostly revered and occasionally reviled, he is passionately characterized along the entire continuum as everything from a heroic defender of the poor, to a cold-hearted executioner. Admired, sanctified, romanticized and derided, his crystallized status as either a brilliant intellectual or a violent ideologue is usually dependent on where one falls along the left and right of the political spectrum. The debate around his legacy is further complicated by the fact that Guevara exists simultaneously as several different entities, both literal man and global emblem, leading to disputes between what people contend he did and what he now represents.|$|E

The episode does not feature a chalkboard or couch gag, cutting straight from the clouds to the TV. The 1994 original airing and some syndication edits have included a couch gag.|$|E
500|$|It {{was during}} a train journey in Japan that Abbe first met Ueshiba.

[...] Ueshiba replied: [...] "I {{know who you}} are," [...] to which Abbe {{modestly}} retorted: [...] "Everyone knows me, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Champion of All Japan." [...] Ueshiba then introduced himself as the Founder of Aikido, and was told by Abbe that he didn't look strong {{enough to be a}} martial arts master. Ueshiba then offered Abbe his little finger, and said: [...] "But young man, you look very strong indeed. Please break my finger." [...] Abbe at first declined, but eventually accepted the challenge, presumably to shut the old man up. Abbe claimed that, as he took hold of the old man's finger and tried to break it, he found himself {{on the floor of the}} carriage and totally immobilised. Whilst on the floor Abbe asked Ueshiba for permission to study under him.|$|E

And then he told Harry that I had asked <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> <b>And</b> Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E
