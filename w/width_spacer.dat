The authors also wish to acknowledge Associate Professor L. J. Cui and J. Wu for fruitful discussions and continuous encouragement throughout this workThe influences of channel layer <b>width,</b> <b>spacer</b> layer width, and delta-doping density on the electron density and its distribution in the AlSb/InAs high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) have been studied based on the self-consistent calculation of the Schrodinger and Poisson equations with both the strain and nonparabolicity effects being taken into account. The results show that, having little influence on the total two dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) concentration in the channel, the HEMT's channel layer width has some influence on the electron mobility, with a channel as narrow as 100 - 130 angstrom being more beneficial. For the AlSb/InAs HEMT with a Te delta-doped layer, the 2 DEG concentration as high as 9. 1 X 10 (12) cm(- 2) can be achieved in the channel by enhancing the delta-doping concentration without the occurrence of the parallel conduction. When utilizing a Si delta-doped InAs layer as the electron-supplying layer of the AlSb/InAs HEMT, the effect of the InAs donor layer thickness is studied on the 2 DEG concentration. To obtain a higher 2 DEG concentration in the channel, it is necessary to use an InAs donor layer as thin as 4 monolayer. To test the validity of our calculation, we have compared our theoretical results (2 DEG concentration and its distribution in different sub-bands of the channel) with the experimental ones done by other groups and show that our theoretical calculation is consistent with the experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Among multi-gate {{field effect}} {{transistor}} (FET) structures, FinFET has better short channel control and ease of manufacturability {{when compared to other}} conventional bulk devices. The radio frequency (RF) performance of FinFET is affected by gate-controlled parameters such as transconductance, output conductance, and total gate capacitance. In recent years, high-k spacer dielectric materials for manufacturing nanoscale devices are being widely explored because of their better electrostatic control and being less affected by short channel effects (SCEs). In this paper, we aim to explore the potential benefits of using different Dual-k spacers on source and drain, respectively: (AsymD-kk) trigate FinFET structure to improve the analog/RF figure of merit (FOM) for low-power operation at 14 nm gate length. It has been observed from the results that the AsymD-kk FinFET structure improves the coupling of the gate fringe field to the underlap region towards the source and drain side, improving the transconductance (gm) and output conductance (gds) at the cost of an increase in Miller capacitance. Furthermore, to reduce the drain field influence on the channel region, we also studied the effect of asymmetric drain extension length on a Dual-kk FinFET structure. It can be observed that the new asymmetric drain extension structures significantly improve the cutoff frequency (fT) and maximum oscillation frequency (fmax) given the significant reduction of inner fringe capacitance towards drain side due to the shifting of the drain extension’s doping concentration away from the gate edge. Therefore, the asymmetric drain extension Dual-kk trigate FinFET (AsymD-kkDE) is a new structure that combines different Dual-k spacers on the source and drain and asymmetric drain extension on a single silicon on insulator (SOI) platform to enhance the almost all analog/RF FOM. The proposed structure is verified by technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations with varying device physical parameters such as fin height, fin width, aspect ratio, spacer <b>width,</b> <b>spacer</b> material, etc. From comprehensive 3 D device simulation, we have demonstrated that the proposed device is superior in performance to a conventional trigate FinFET and can be used to design low-power digital circuits...|$|E

Current overlay capabilities are ≈0.6 nm for exposures of equal density (e.g., LELE) and ≈2.0 nm for dense lines vs. cuts/vias (e.g., SADP or SAQP) on dedicated or matched tools.

TheFabry-Perot (FP) cavity provides an efficient tool for confining light. However, the conventional FP cavity length is usually comparable to or larger than the lightwavelength, making them inconvenient for many applications. By manipulating the reflection phase at the cavity boundaries, the FP cavity length could be made much smaller than thewavelength.

For very narrow slit <b>width</b> and <b>spacer</b> thickness, a typical zero-order and deep subwavelength FP resonance in themetallic slits can be strongly induced. Moreover, due to the subwavelength FP resonance, greatly enhanced electromagnetic pressure can also be induced in the system.
