People praised Turner's shift from the [...] "politically correct claptrap" [...] of Captain Planet and the Planeteers, giving Real Adventures a B grade as [...] "children's programming the way it oughta be". The authors of 1998's Saturday Morning Fever contrarily felt the show lacked [...] "the sense of why the original was so successful". They disliked H-B's packaging of disparate seasons as one series, preferring the second for its characters and classic references. Greg Aaron of HotWired praised the franchise's return but warned against QuestWorld hype, arguing that [...] "it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> visual sophistication to hook today's viewers".|$|E

[...] The piece {{also pointed out that}} times have changed since the original series left the air, citing other shows that were set in Hawaii which have come and gone. It expressed a hope that the producers will succeed in bringing a new life to the title with this remake. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly graded the episode B+, calling it an [...] "unexpected pleasure," [...] and praised Caan for being [...] "terrific as the moody but excellent" [...] Danno. Tucker also believed that Kim and Park [...] "play off each other nicely." [...] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times felt that the script was [...] "neatly balanced between action, clever banter and serious issues," [...] adding that it [...] "seems poised to hold its own in the modern age." [...] McNamara also liked O'Loughlin's performance, stating that his [...] "limpid-eye woodenness" [...] worked well for the role. Hanh Nguyen of Zap2it stated that it was [...] "damn entertaining" [...] and [...] "visually stimulating," [...] and enjoyed the chemistry between McGarrett and Danny.|$|E

500|$|USA Today Robert Bianco {{acknowledged}} that the episode managed to avoid repeating many of the second season's mistakes noting that the four main characters spend more time together and the annual mystery [...] "is hot-wired into the housewives themselves." [...] Bianco remarked that Cross successfully maintained her position as the series' most prominent lead and was pleased with Susan's storyline, calling it [...] "a conflict that gives Teri Hatcher a genuinely funny, rather than forced, sight gag." [...] He approved of the writers' decision to distance the characters from their second season storylines, but opined: [...] "The harder mistake to overcome is the damage the show did to its main characters — allowing them to behave in ways that made them seem weak, selfish, stupid and, at times, despicable." [...] Bianco concluded: [...] "It <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one good episode to win us back after all that. But it's certainly {{a good place to}} start." [...] Jen Creer of TV Squad was mixed in her review. She criticized the lack of originality in the storylines, writing that the episode was similar to Sex and the City. Nevertheless, Creer complimented the main actresses, concluding, [...] "I'll be tuning in next week [...] for all of its camp and unoriginality, the show does continue to have that certain something, those little twists of genius that make it worth watching." [...] Andy Dehnart of MSNBC was slightly more positive in his review, acknowledging that while [...] "most of the housewives are stuck in their second-season ruts," [...] the show's overall quality has improved, citing the Orson storyline as a welcomed change from the slow-moving Applewhite mystery arc. Overall, Dehnart approved of the episode and felt that the show [...] "may be on track to finally pleasuring its audience in new, albeit familiar ways." ...|$|E

They are then informed that the dungeon has been breached and call for the guards. Meanwhile, Kröd angrily threatens a nearby guard, who tells him about a recently patched tunnel in the wall from a previous prisoner escape attempt that was recently thwarted, and then argues with Aneka when he learns how she obtained the dungeon keys. She insists that as a pagan warrioress, [...] "sex is just another weapon in my arsenal”: when Krod reacts badly to this, Aneka storms off (prompting Dongalor to sneer the titular line, [...] "Wench trouble, Mandoon?"). Dongalor and the guards arrive and he fire an arrow at Kröd, but Arcadius dives in front of it and is shot instead. (Humorously, Arcadius survives the arrow and just as Krod yells, [...] "It <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one arrow to kill the greatest general [...] who ever lived!", several more arrows come flying into Arcadius' chest along with a spear, and an axe smashes into his head.) Just before Arcadius dies, he says the word Engamora. Kröd and the others escape through the tunnel. Barnabus tells Dongalor that Engamora refers to a prophecy that chronicles the overthrow of an empire {{at the hands of a}} [...] "low-born swordsman", which they believe to be Kröd.|$|E

2500|$|Under Mayor Turner, Houston Police Department {{has seen}} a mass exodus of officers, {{due in large part}} to ongoing {{conflict}} between the Mayor's office and the Houston Police Department's Pension Fund Management. In early 2017, changes were made to the police officers pension fund, which resulted in many long-serving officers to lose part of their contributions, which are being funneled back into the aggregate fund in order to bolster the fund's holdings. Multiple controversies over this and other issues related to the pension, retirement rank and calculations of pension amounts have resulted in a substantial number of police officers retiring from HPD before the new pension policies went into effect. A substantial number of officers are continuing to retire or resign, causing the number of police officers who are actually and actively working in some capacity as licensed peace officers to be in drastic decline. Among those divisions hardest hit includes the Patrol Divisions. While Houston Police Department spokespersons repeatedly declined to provide solid or specific numbers of patrol officers actively [...] "working the streets," [...] current officers in multiple areas (Patrol Districts) frequently complain about a lack of manpower, inadequate and slow-to-respond back-up units, and citizens join these officers in reporting increasingly poor response times and inadequate police presence on active scenes. These officers worry about increased safety concerns and fears related to greater danger to the officers because of the lack of manpower, especially during the night shift. Sometimes, officers working the overnight shift must contend with only one or two units covering an entire [...] "beat," [...] areas which are subdivisions of Districts. It is now routine, for example, for officers covering a beat to have units who are assigned two or three beats away called away from their beats to respond to calls for assistance or extra manpower. This not only impacts response time to a fellow officer who is calling for urgent help, but it then leaves other beats with reduced and often no coverage for their own beats while they are responding to an officer in another beat. These situations are now commonplace in many Police Districts. A recent estimate given by a high-ranking supervisor for HPD was that there are approximately 3,500 sworn officers (the total umber of actively employed, licensed peace officers in all Divisions and administrative positions) currently serving as Houston Police Officers. By comparison, this is roughly equal to the number of sworn HPD officers employed 25 – 30 years ago. While the Mayor's Office and newly appointed Houston Police Chief Arturo [...] "Art" [...] Acevedo's (Formerly Chief of Police for Austin, Texas) Office maintain that they are [...] "filling the gaps," [...] at the current rate of attrition (officers leaving HPD via retirement and resignation) compared to the number of new officers graduating from the HPD Academy (the [...] "classroom" [...] portion of which lasts approximately six months and the [...] "practical" [...] portion of which lasts another six months), even with multiple classes overlapping (approximately 4 classes of 50 cadets each) it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a decade, using the most [...] "optimistic" [...] projections, just to return The Houston Police Department to the often-promoted number of 5,000 police officers. When one is reminded of that other often-quoted statistic that Houston is the [...] "fastest growing city in the nation" [...] (actually, recent reports from the US Census Bureau show Houston dropping to number two last year, thanks in large part to the current oil bust) and that as the fourth largest city in the United States (provided that Houston has not already overtaken Chicago's population, which by some estimates it has), simply bringing Houston's police force back to 5,000 officers after 10 more years of substantial growth (Houston added an estimated 85,000+ individuals during 2016), Houston could potentially add 1 to 1.5 million people during the next decade of growth. By comparison, the Chicago Police Department has approximately 12,000+ sworn officers. These numbers are similar on both their Wikipedia page as well as the Chicago Police Department's website. So in comparison between these two cities with virtually identical populations, Chicago has four times the number of police officers and shows a negative growth trend (their population is declining over the last several years) while Houston, with 3,000 sworn officers, has the number two growth trend of any city in the nation.|$|E
