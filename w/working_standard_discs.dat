40|$|There {{is nearly}} always some {{mismatch}} between the physical properties of items containing nuclear material and standards used to calibrate the assay method. Physical properties include the density and heterogeneity of the item's nonnuclear {{material and the}} type of interfering species, such as hydrogen in the case of neutron counting. Some assay techniques are less sensitive to variation in physical properties than others and can be used to generate <b>working</b> <b>standards.</b> Provided that a reference assay method 1 (often calorimetry) is available that is well characterized (having negligible or known dependence on varying physical properties), we can assess the total measurement error of another method 2. In this paper we consider the impact of the number of measurement categories on the measurement error standard deviation of method 2. We assume that <b>working</b> <b>standards</b> (traceable to primary reference standards) are provided by the method 1 assay of actual facility items. Given the same number of <b>working</b> <b>standards,</b> we evaluate the tradeoff between using more <b>working</b> <b>standards</b> for each of a fewer number of categories versus using fewer standards in each of more categories. This leads to a method to determine a good allocation of <b>working</b> <b>standards...</b>|$|R

40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) born aerobic gram-negative bacteria was evaluated during a six months period at a teaching hospital in Tehran, and {{determination of the}} validity of the results obtained from disc diffusion tests, using discsmanufactured in Iran. Disc susceptibility tests using Iranian and <b>standard</b> <b>discs</b> (diffusion discs available in international markets) were performed on 108 aerobic gram-negative isolates obtained from the clinical samples of patients with at least 72 hours of stay in the ICU. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) was subsequently determined by collaborators not involved with the disc testing evaluation. Acinetobacter was the most frequently isolated gram negative species (26 %). High resistance rates were obtained for all antibiotics studied except for imipenem (98 % sensitive). Results of disc diffusion tests performed by the Iranian discs were in moderate to strong agreement with those obtained from the <b>standard</b> <b>discs.</b> When comparing disc results with the MIC results, it was noted that the total number of very major, and minor iscrepancieswere approximately the same with both sets of discs. The total number of major discrepancies was higher for the Iranian discs (more false positive results). The total number of very major discrepancy rates was more than the acceptable 1. 5 % limits for each antibiotic tested, using both Iranian and <b>standard</b> <b>discs.</b> High rates of resistance in aerobic gram-negative isolates studied, leaves imipenem as the only reliable agent for the empirical treatment of ICU infections. The high rates of very majordiscrepancies with both sets of discs show that physicians cannot rely on disc diffusion tests only, in order to guide therapy for the treatment of very serious infections in the ICUs, even if <b>standard</b> <b>discs</b> are used instead of the Iranian discs, and there is great need to establish a fast and easy way to determine the MIC values.

40|$|Summary. Separation of ovine seminal plasma {{proteins}} in the disc electrophoretic system revealed a consistent pattern of sixteen fractions with some variation among six rams {{in the relative}} amount of minor components, whereas bovine seminal plasma had twelve fractions. In both species, the major seminal plasma components had electrophoretic mobilities somewhat less than did the albumin band of the corresponding blood plasma. The prealbumin region of the seminal plasma electro-phoretograms contained four fractions in the ovine samples and three fractions in the bovine samples. Storage ofdiluted ovine and bovine semen at 5 =deg did not alter the total protein concentration in the seminal plasma. <b>Standard</b> <b>disc</b> electrophoretic patterns showed {{that two of the}} sixteen ovine seminal plasma protein fractions disappeared during such storage. No changes were evident in either the standard or basic electrophoretograms of bovine seminal plasma during storage of semen. <b>Standard</b> <b>disc</b> electrophoretograms of ovine and bovine sperm extracts showed many lightly staining bands, but no progressive changes were evident in these electrophoretic patterns during storage of semen...|$|R
