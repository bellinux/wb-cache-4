[...] Lewis told The A.V. Club, [...] "We played them on the road 100 times, so <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could walk into the studio and record them the same way. [...] It wasn't really a studio record, but more of a live record in some ways.

Beginning in Amazing Adventures #16 (by Englehart with art by Bob Brown and Frank McLaughlin), the story continued in Justice League of America #103 (by Wein, Dick Dillin and Dick Giordano), and concluded in Thor #207 (by Conway and penciler John Buscema). As Englehart explained in 2010, [...] "It certainly seemed like a radical concept and <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had to be subtle (laughs) and each story had to stand on its own, but we really worked it out.
