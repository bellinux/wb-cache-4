The preliminary results revealed that binary nanofluids stabilities could be improved effectively when concentration ratios of TiNTs to TiNSs are at suitable range compared with TiNTs or TiNSs alone, otherwise stabilities were deteriorated seriously.

40|$|Variability in {{the high}} {{mortality}} rate during early life stages {{is considered to be}} one of the principal determinants of year-class variability in fish stocks.

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} difference is the ZIFs hydrophobic properties and <b>water</b> <b>stability.</b> A man issue with zeolites and MOFs, to a certain extent, was their adsorption of water along with CO2.7 Water vapor is often found in carbon-rich exhaust gases, and MOFs would absorb the water, lowering the amount of CO2 required to reach saturation. MOFs are also less stable in moist and oxygen rich environments due to metal-oxygen bonds performing hydrolysis. ZIFs, however, have nearly identical performances in dry and humid conditions, showing much higher CO2 selectivity over water, allowing the adsorbent to store more carbon before saturation is reached.|$|E

50|$|Another {{variation}} of liquid exfoliation is “basic N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) liquid exfoliation”. Bulk black phosphorene {{is added to}} a saturated NaOH/NMP solution, which is further sonicated for 4 hours to conduct liquid exfoliation. The solution is then centrifuged twice, first for 10 minutes to remove any unexfoliated black phosphorus and then for 20 minutes at higher speed to separate thick layers of phosphorene (5-12 layers) from NMP. The supernatant then is centrifuged again at higher speed for another 20 minutes to separate thinner layers of phosphorene (1-7 layers). The precipitate from centrifugation is then redispersed in water and washed several times by deionized water. Phosphorene/water solution is dropped onto silicon with a 280-nm SiO2 surface, where it is further dried under vacuum.

5000|$|In the Southern Ocean in the Antarctic zone, nanophytoplankton are {{the most}} {{abundant}} type of plankton in terms of number, but not volume. Antarctic marine flora consists almost entirely of algae, with phytoplankton, and therefore nanophytoplankton, being the most numerous type, as having great importance. Nanophytoplankton growth has been seen in pack-ice, covering nearly 73% of the Southern Ocean {{by the end of}} the winter. They even grow on icebergs. Nanophytoplankton production is affected by light intensity and duration, ice, surface <b>water</b> <b>stability,</b> and currents. Also, availability of silicates, a nutrient for the organism, can affect photosynthetic efficiency and cell composition. [...] Nanophytoplankton also require vitamins. They thrive in areas of shallow water where there is upwelling and mixing. Although optimal growth for the species occurs in water 5-7 °C, growth still occurs in Antarctic waters, which can reach as low as -2 °C. Limitation of light intensity and duration is another factor for survival. In Antarctica, the sun’s lower position above the horizon reduces light due to increased reflection, and the stormy seas reduce transmission of light due to bubble formations. However, some Antarctic nanophytoplankton seem to be adapted to low light levels. Most phytoplankton exist in warmer, equatorial waters. For example, in the northwestern Philippine Sea, the average number of nanophytoplankton was 1x10^4/l. It is the nanophytoplankton in particular that seem to survive better under the conditions provided by the oceans of the Antarctic. A physiological change in the cells must have occurred to allow this phenomenon. Low salinity is desirable for survival, as well.|$|E
