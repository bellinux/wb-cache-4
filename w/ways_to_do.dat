25|$|The 1990s {{ushered in}} a new era. For several years the Department of Defense {{had been looking for}} leaner, and smarter {{cost-saving}} <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> business. However, this process was intensified with the unexpected collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and the demise of the Soviet Union. Americans expected a peace dividend—a reduction in defense spending. Downsizing became the key word, but Brooks AFB continued to grow.|$|E
25|$|The {{next step}} in {{miniaturization}} was {{to speed up the}} fissioning of the pit to reduce the minimum inertial confinement time. This would allow the efficient fission of the fuel with less mass in the form of tamper or the fuel itself. The key to achieving faster fission would be to introduce more neutrons, and among the many <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this, adding a fusion reaction was relatively easy {{in the case of a}} hollow pit.|$|E
25|$|Laser fusion was {{suggested}} in 1962 by scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, {{shortly after the}} invention of the laser itself in 1960. At the time, Lasers were low power machines, but low-level research began as early as 1965. Laser fusion, formally known as inertial confinement fusion, involves imploding a target by using laser beams. There are two <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this: indirect drive and direct drive. In direct drive, the laser blasts a pellet of fuel. In indirect drive, the lasers blast a structure around the fuel. This makes x-rays that squeeze the fuel. Both methods compress the fuel so that fusion can take place.|$|E

25|$|Techno-liberals {{look for}} change. By their nature, they're not {{satisfied}} with the way things are and want to find new <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things. Liberals in technology arena move a society forward as the opportunists. Technoliberalism is actually more about civil liberties and individual rights such as Free Internet, Net neutrality for landline Internet not for mobile or satellites, gun control and Pro abortion, etc. Techno-liberalism represents socio-cultural perspectives that imply all human endeavors. This includes how we develop and use technology, especially computer technology. In the technology arena, liberalism normally points to innovation and risk-taking. Furthermore, if you're a techno-liberal in information technology, the future can't come soon enough. For those who see the true promise of the web for multi-media and as a general platform for application software, the Internet is still far too slow and primitive.|$|E
