40|$|With {{the high}} tempo-spatial Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph 1330 Å images, {{we find that}} many bright {{structures}} {{are rooted in the}} light bridge of NOAA 12192, forming a light wall. The light wall is brighter than the surrounding areas, and the wall top is much brighter than the <b>wall</b> <b>body.</b> The New Vacuum Solar Telescope Hα and the Solar Dynamics Observatory 171 Å and 131 Å images are also used to study the light wall properties. In 1330 Å, 171 Å, and 131 Å, the top of the wall has a higher emission, while in the Hα line, the wall top emission is very low. The <b>wall</b> <b>body</b> corresponds to bright areas in 1330 Å and dark areas in the other lines. The top of the light wall moves upward and downward successively, performing oscillations in height. The deprojected mean height, amplitude, oscillation velocity, and the dominant period are determined to be 3. 6 Mm, 0. 9 Mm, 15. 4 km s^- 1, and 3. 9 min, respectively. We interpret the oscillations of the light wall as the leakage of p-modes from below the photosphere. The constant brightness enhancement of the wall top implies the existence of some kind of atmospheric heating, e. g., via the persistent small-scale reconnection or the magneto-acoustic waves. In another series of 1330 Å images, we find that the wall top in the upward motion phase is significantly brighter than in the downward phase. This kind of oscillations may be powered by the energy released due to intermittent impulsive magnetic reconnection. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures; accepted for publication in ApJ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMidline defects {{account for}} {{approximately}} 5 % of congenital abnormalities observed at birth. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying {{the formation of}} the ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> are not well understood. Recent studies linked mutations in Porcupine—an O-acetyl transferase mediating Wnt ligand acylation—with defects in the thoracic <b>body</b> <b>wall.</b> We hypothesized that anomalous Wnt signaling is involved in the pathogenesis of defective closure of the thoracic <b>body</b> <b>wall.</b> We generated a mouse model wherein Wntless (Wls), which encodes a cargo receptor mediating secretion of Wnt ligands, was conditionally deleted from the developing mesenchyme using Dermo 1 Cre mice. Wlsf/f;Dermo 1 Cre/+ embryos died during mid-gestation. At E 13. 5, skeletal defects were observed in the forelimbs, jaw, and rib cage. At E 14. 5, midline defects in the thoracic <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> began to emerge: the sternum failed to fuse and the heart protruded through the <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> at the midline (ectopia cordis). To determine the molecular mechanism underlying the phenotype observed in Wlsf/f;Dermo 1 Cre/+ embryos, we tested whether Wnt/β-catenin signaling was operative in developing the embryonic ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> using Axin 2 LacZ and BatGal reporter mice. While Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity was observed at the midline of the ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> before sternal fusion, this pattern of activity was altered and scattered throughout the <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> after mesenchymal deletion of Wls. Mesenchymal cell migration was disrupted in Wlsf/f;Dermo 1 Cre/+ thoracic <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> partially due to anomalous β-catenin independent Wnt signaling as determined by in vitro assays. Deletion of Lrp 5 and Lrp 6 receptors, which mediate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the mesenchyme, partially recapitulated the phenotype observed in the chest midline of Wlsf/f;Dermo 1 Cre/+ embryos supporting a role for Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity in the normal formation of the ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> mesenchyme. We conclude that Wls-mediated secretion of Wnt ligands from the developing ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> mesenchyme plays a critical role in fusion of the sternum and closure of the secondary <b>body</b> <b>wall.</b> Thus, impaired Wls activity in the ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> mesenchyme is a mechanism underlying ectopia cordis and unfused sternum...|$|R

40|$|With the {{high-resolution}} {{data from}} the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, we detect a light wall above a sunspot light bridge in the NOAA active region (AR) 12403. In the 1330 A slit-jaw images, the light wall is brighter than the ambient areas while the wall top and base are much brighter than the <b>wall</b> <b>body,</b> and it keeps oscillating above the light bridge. A C 8. 0 flare caused by a filament activation occurred in this AR with the peak at 02 : 52 UT on 2015 August 28, and the flare's one ribbon overlapped the light bridge which was the observational base of the light wall. Consequently, the oscillation of the light wall was evidently disturbed. The mean projective oscillation amplitude of the light wall increased from 0. 5 Mm to 1. 6 Mm before the flare, and decreased to 0. 6 Mm after the flare. We suggest that the light wall shares a group of magnetic field lines with the flare loops, which undergo a magnetic reconnection process, and they constitute a coupled system. When the magnetic field lines are pushed upwards at the pre-flare stage, the light wall turns to the vertical direction, resulting in the increase of the light wall's projective oscillation amplitude. After the magnetic reconnection takes place, a group of new field lines with smaller scales are formed underneath the reconnection site and the light wall inclines. Thus, the projective amplitude decreases remarkably at the post-flare stage. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ...|$|E
40|$|The {{particle}} rebounding {{characteristics of}} a gas-particle flow over a cylindrical body is investigated. With the aid of both computational and experimental approaches, the mean particle flow patterns, comprising both incident and rebound particles resulting from the impact of particles on a curved wall surface, are examined. In the experimental investigation, a two-dimensional Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) technique {{is used in the}} immediate vicinity of the body surface to measure the instantaneous incident and rebound particle velocities. The Reynolds-Averaging Navier-Stokes equations are solved for the continuum gas phase, and the results are used in conjunction with a Lagrangian trajectory model to predict the particle-rebound behavior in the immediate vicinity of the cylindrical wall. The computational observations, also confirmed through experiments, reveal a particle rebound zone where the mean particle flow pattern is significantly modified due to the contribution of the rebound particles during the process of particle-wall impact interaction. This particle rebound zone is found to be a function of mainly the Stokes number (particle inertia), {{and to a lesser extent}} on the fluid Reynolds number (gas flow condition), except for high gas flow velocities and restitution coefficients (particle-wall impact characteristics). Analysis of the effect of the above-mentioned parameters on the rebounding particle flow characteristics and their interrelationship has provided a better understanding of the behavior of particle flow impinging on a solid <b>wall</b> <b>body.</b> The beneficial contributions of the experimental and computational approaches in their ability to better quantify the particle-wall impact interaction phenomena present additional foundational investigations that could be further undertaken to better comprehend the particle behavior in curved wall surfaces.

40|$|AbstractHuman {{birth defects}} {{involving}} the ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> are common, yet {{little is known}} about the mechanism of <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> closure in mammals. The AP- 2 α transcription factor knock-out mouse provides an exceptional tool to understand this particular pathology, since it has one of the most severe ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> closure defects, thoracoabdominoschisis. To gain insight into the complex morphological events responsible for <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> closure, we have studied this developmental process in AP- 2 α knock-out mice. Several tissues involved in normal ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> closure are defective in the absence of AP- 2 α, including those associated with the primary <b>body</b> <b>wall,</b> the umbilical ring, and the mesoderm of the secondary <b>body</b> <b>wall.</b> These defects, coupled with the expression pattern of AP- 2 α, suggest that AP- 2 α is involved in multiple developmental mechanisms directing the morphogenesis of the ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall,</b> including cell migration, differentiation, and death. There is a failure of migration and fusion of the body folds at the umbilical ring, as well as in the formation and migration of the abdominal bands and ventral musculature. Furthermore, the mechanism of cell deposition at the umbilical ring is disturbed. Consequently, the mesodermal compartment of the <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> is underdeveloped. We also suggest that AP- 2 α is required for signaling from the surface ectoderm to the underlying mesoderm for proper development and closure of the ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall.</b> These findings provide a fundamental understanding of how AP- 2 α functions in the closure of the ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall,</b> as well as offer insight into related human birth defects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDefects of the ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> are {{prevalent}} birth anomalies {{marked by}} deficiencies in <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> closure, hypoplasia of the abdominal musculature and multiple malformations across a gamut of organs. However, the mechanisms underlying ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> defects remain elusive. Here, we investigated {{the role of}} Wnt signaling in ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> development by inactivating Wls or β-catenin in murine abdominal ectoderm. The loss of Wls in the ventral epithelium, which blocks the secretion of Wnt proteins, resulted in dysgenesis of ventral musculature and genito-urinary tract during embryonic development. Molecular analyses revealed that the dermis and myogenic differentiation in the underlying mesenchymal progenitor cells was perturbed {{by the loss of}} ectodermal Wls. The activity of the Wnt-Pitx 2 axis was impaired in the ventral mesenchyme of the mutant <b>body</b> <b>wall,</b> which partially accounted for the defects in ventral musculature formation. In contrast, epithelial depletion of β-catenin or Wnt 5 a did not resemble the <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> defects in the ectodermal Wls mutant. These findings indicate that ectodermal Wnt signaling instructs the underlying mesodermal specification and abdominal musculature formation during ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> development, adding evidence to the theory that ectoderm-mesenchyme signaling is a potential unifying mechanism for the origin of ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> defects...|$|R

40|$|Fragrances {{have been}} used since at least 5000 years ago and all {{traditional}} scents are found in modern perfumes. Although perfumes are obviously involved in sexual communication, the significance of great individual differences in preference for fragrances is an evolutionary puzzle. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a highly polymorphic and conserved set of genes that {{plays an important role}} in immune function in vertebrates. Both mice and humans have been shown to prefer die body odor of potential partners that have a dissimilar MHC genotype, which would result in heterozygous offspring. We tested whether individual preferences for perfume ingredients correlate with a person's MHC genotype. The human MHC is called HLA (human leukocyte antigen). A total of 137 male and female students who had been typed for their MHC (HLA-A, -B, -DR) scored 36 scents in a first test for use on self ("Would your like to smell like that yourself?") and a subset of 18 scents 2 years later either for use on self or for a potential partner ("Would you like your partner to smell like that?"). An overall analysis showed a significant correlation between the MHC and the scorings of the scents "for self" in both tests. In a detailed analysis we found a significant interaction of the two most common HLAs with the rating of the 36 scents in the first study as well as with the 18 scents in the second study when evaluated for self. This result suggests that persons who share, for example, HLA-A 2, have a similar preference for any of the perfume ingredients. The significant repeatability of these preferences in the two tests showed that the volunteers that had either HLA-A 1 or HLA-A 2 were significantly consistent in their preferences for the perfume ingredients offered. Hardly any significant correlation between MHC genotype and ratings of the scents "for partner" were found. This agrees with the hypothesis that perfumes are selected "for self" to amplify in some <b>wall</b> <b>body</b> odors that reveal a person's immunogenetic...|$|E

However, it is unknown whether variations in serum values of these minerals are in relationship with lipid profile and adiposity as metabolic risk factors of cardiovascular events in premenopausal women independent of confoun-ders. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between serum calcium, magnesium and phosphorous with lipid profile in healthy premenopausal women. Materials and methods: This study was performed on 82 reproductive age women aged 17 - 50 who were randomly selected from general population of Tabriz, Iran. They were assigned into obese and none-obese groups. Weight and height for BMI calculation were measured using a calibrated Seca scale and cotton ruler which was attached to the <b>wall.</b> <b>Body</b> composition was analyzed by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Serum magnesium, calcium and phosphorous were measured colorimetrically; fasting blood glucose (FBG) and serum lipids were assessed by enzymatic methods. Results: Obese woman had significantly lower serum magnesium (P = 0. 035) and significantly higher fasting blood glucose (P = 0. 028), total cholesterol (P = 0. 035), triglyceride (P = 0. 019), low density lipoprotein (P= 0. 003) and parathyroid hormone concentrations (P = 0. 031) compared to non obese women. In correlation coefficient analysis, serum calcium concentrations had a positive weak relati-onship with total cholesterol (r = 0. 267, P = 0. 013) and triglyceride (r = 0. 301, P = 0. 005) concentrations in all participants; whereas in separate analysis of subjects as obese and non obese groups, the-se relationships lost their significance. Serum phosphorous had a weak positive relationship with total cholesterol (r = 0. 31, P = 0. 002) and an inverse weak relationship with parathyroid hormone (r = - 0. 32, P = 0. 002). After adjusting for confounding variables by multiple regression analysis, the positive relationship between serum calcium, triglyceride, high density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein cholesterol were significant. Conclusion: Our results indicate that abnormality in serum calcium and phosphorous is significantly correlated with serum lipids. Further studies are warranted for interpretation of these associations and understanding the underlying mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{particle}} rebounding {{characteristics of a}} gas-particle flow over a cylindrical body and an in-line tube bundle arrangement is investigated. With the aid of both experimental and numerical approaches, the mean particulate flow patterns, comprising both incident and rebound particles resulting from the impact of particles on solid walls, are examined. In the experimental investigation, a two-dimensional laser-Doppler anemometry (LDA) technique {{is used in the}} immediate vicinity of the body surface to measure the instantaneous incident and rebound particle velocities. The Reynolds-averaging Navier-Stokes equations are solved for the continuum gas phase and the results are used in conjunction with a Lagrangian trajectory model to predict the particle-rebound characteristics. For the single tube model, the experimental observations, also confirmed through computations, reveal a particle rebound zone where the mean particulate flow pattern is significantly modified due to the contribution of the rebound particles during the process of particle-wall impact interaction. This particle rebound zone is found to be a function of mainly the Stokes number (particle inertia), {{and to a lesser extent}} on the fluid Reynolds number (gas flow condition) except for high gas flow velocities. For the in-line tube bundle model, particles being rebounded from the first row of tubes at upstream migrated downstream and impinged the other tubes in an extremely complex and random disposition. Detailed measurements on the flow and turbulent characteristics within the subset containing two cylindrical tubes representing the flow over the first and second row tubes in the tube bundle configuration revealed that the heavier particles possessed higher axial and transverse velocity fluctuations than the gas and lighter particles. A means of quantifying the erosion rate using a semi-empirical relationship and CFD approach is presented. The erosion distributions were found to be significantly different between the lighter and heavier particles. Analysis of the effect of the above-mentioned parameters on the rebounding particle flow characteristics and their interrelationship has provided a better understanding on the behaviour of particulate flow impinging on a solid <b>wall</b> <b>body</b> or series of solid bodies. The usefulness of employing the experimental and computational approaches to quantify the particle-wall impact interaction phenomena ill this study provides the basis for additional investigations to be undertaken to better comprehend the particulate behaviour in tube bundle structure, for example staggered tube arrangement commonly found in many commercial heat exchangers...|$|E

40|$|A {{description}} of Physa marmorata Guilding, 1828, based on material collected at its type-locality, the Caribbean island of Saint Vincent, is presented. The shell is thin, horn-colored, surface very glossy, diaphanous. Spire acute, elevated; protoconch distinct, rounded-conical, reddish-brown; five not shouldered, broadly convex whorls with subobsolete spiral lines and thin growth lines. Aperture elongated, 1. 4 - 2. 0 {{times as long}} as the remaining shell length, narrow obovate-lunate; upper half acute-angled,lower half oval,narrowly rounded at the base, outer lip sharp, inner lip completely closing the umbilical region; a very distinct callus on the parietal wall; columellar lip with a low ridge gradually merging into the callus. ratios: shell width/shell length = 0. 44 - 0. 52 (mean 0. 47); spire length /shell lenght = 0. 33 - 0. 41 (mean 0. 39); aperture length/shell lenght = 0. 59 - 0. 67 (mean 0. 62). Oral lappets laterally mucronate, foot spatulate with deeply pigmented acuminate tail. Mantle reflection with 6 - 10 short triangular dentations covering nearly half the right surface of the body whorl, and 4 - 6 covering a part of the ventral <b>wall.</b> <b>Body</b> surface with tiny dots of greenish-yellow pigment besides melanin. Renal tube tightly folded in toa zigzag course. Ovotestis diverticula acinous, laterally pressed against each other around a collecting canal. Ovispermiduct with well-developed seminal vesicle. oviduct highly convoluted, merging into a less convoluted nidamental gland which narrows to a funnel-shaped uterus and a short vagina. Spermathecal body oblong, more or less constricted in the middle and somewhat curved; spermathecal duct uniformly narrow, a little longer than be body. About 20 prostatic diverticula, simple, bifurcate or divided into a few short branches, distalmost ones assembled into a cluster. Penis long, nearly uniformly narrow; penial canal with lateral opening about the junction of its middle and lower thirds. Penial sheath with a bulbous terminal expasion the tip of which isinserted into the caudal end of the prepuce. Prepuce shouldered, much wider than the narrow portion of the penial sheath. Penial sheath/prepuce ratio about 2. 08 (1. 45 - 2. 75). The main extrinsic muscles of the penial complex are a retractor, with a branch attached to the bulb, and another to the caudal end of the penial sheath; and a protractor, with a branch attached to the shoulder of the prepuce and adjoining area of the penial sheath, and another to the caudal end of the penial sheath. Egg capsule C-shaped, with 10 - 30 elliptical eggs (snails 10 mm long) measuring about 1. 10 mm (0. 90 - 1. 32) through the long axis and surrounded by an inner and an outer lamellate membranes.

Razões: largura da concha/comprimento da concha = 0. 44 - 0. 52 (média 0. 47); comprimento da espira/comprimento da concha = 0. 33 - 0. 41 (média 0. 39); comprimento da abertura/comprimento da concha = 0. 59 - 067 (média 0. 62). Mufla mucronada lateralmente, pé espatulado com cauda acuminada intensamente pigmentada. Reflexão do manto com 6 - 10 deteações triangulares curtas cobrindo quase metade da superfície direita do giro corporal, e 4 - 6 cobrindo parte da parede ventral. Superfície do corpo com minúsculos pontos de pigmento amarelo-esverdeado além da melanina. Divertículos do ovoteste acinosos, comprimidos lateralmente uns contra os outros em torno do canal coletor. Ovispermiduto com vesícula seminal bem desenvolvida. Oviduto muito sinuoso, continuando-se na glândula nidamental menos sinuosa que se estreita para dar lugar ao útero afunilado e a curta vagina. corpo da espermateca oblongo, mais ou menos cinturado na parte média e um tanto curvo; canal da espermateca uniformemente estreito, um pouco mais longo que o corpo. Cerca de 20 divertículos prostáticos simples, bifurcados ou divididos em poucos ramos curtos, os mais distais reunidos em um cacho. Pênis longo, quase uniformemente estreito; canal peniano com abertura lateral amis ou menos na junção dos terços médio e inferior. Bainha do pêniscom expansão terminal bulbosa cuja ponta se insere na extremidade caudal do prepúcio. Prepúcio com ombro, muito mais largo que a porção estreita da bainha do pênis. Razão bainha do pênis/prepúcio cerca de 2. 08 (1. 45 - 2. 75). Os músculos extrínsecos principais do complexo peniano são um retrator, com um ramo inserido no bulbo e outro ramo na extremidade caudal da bainha do pênis; e um protrator, com um ramo inserido no ombro do prepúcio e área adjacente da bainha do pênis e outro ramo na extremidade caudal da bainha do pênis. Cápsulas ovíferas em C, com 10 - 30 ovos elípticos (de caramujos com 10 mm de comprimento) medindo cerca de 1. 10 mm (0. 90 - 1. 32) no eixo mais longo e envolvidos por duas membranas lameladas, interna e externa. A mandíbula é uma placa simples em V obtuso. A rádula será descrita em outro trabalho...|$|E

50|$|Portions of the gut {{tube and}} its derives are {{suspended}} from the dorsal and ventral <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> by mesenteries, double layers of peritoneum that enclose an organ and connect it to the <b>body</b> <b>wall.</b> Such organs are called intraperitoneal, whereas organs that lie against the posterior <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> and are covered by peritoneum on their anterior surface only are considered retroperitoneal. So, mesenteries are double layers of peritoneum that pass from one organ to another or from an organ to the <b>body</b> <b>wall</b> as a peritoneal ligament.
