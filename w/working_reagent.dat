AddItIonal Keyphrases: particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoas-say “microalbuminuria ” calibration stability. diabetes Measurement of proteins and enzymes in urine is becom-ing increasingly important in the detection of renal pathol-ogy (1). The appearance of increased concentrations of certain proteins in urine has been used to assess glomeru-lar permeability and tubular damage (2). Moreover, slightly increased excretion of albumin in urine (“pauci-albuminuria”) has been recognized as an early indicator of renal damage in diabetes (3) -a situation that can be reversed if detected and treated sufficiently early (4). Heretofore, methods for measuring low concentrations of albumin have been confined to heterogeneous immunoas-says involving various labels such as radioisotopes (5), enzymes (6), and fluorophores (7).

Numerous substrates have been proposed for alka-line and acid phosphatase determinations (ortho-phosphoric monoester phosphohydrolase, EC 3. 1. 3. 1 and EC 3. 1. 3. 2, respectively) and, of these, p-nitro-phenyl phosphate (1), phenolphthalein monophos-phate (2), a-naphthyl phosphate (3), and thymol-phthalein monophosphate (4) are commonly used. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate is unstable, even at freezer temperature (5), and the absorption of p-nitrophenol at 404 nm is very close to that of bilirubin. Phenol-phthalein monophosphate is also relatively unstable (2), and the absorption maximum of phenol-phthalein at 550 nm is close to that of hemoglobin.

To {{evaluate}} cytology {{laboratories and}} the performance of cytotechnologists for establishing efficient external quality control for Mexico's National Program for the Prevention and Control of Cervical Cancer.

During January and February 1998, an onsite evaluation of all cytology laboratories of the Ministry of Health found that only 70 % of the microscopes were in adequate <b>working</b> conditions, <b>reagents</b> were out of date, and working conditions were sub-optimal. A program for external quality control based on proficiency testing was established for cytotechnologists. Fifty slide sets with 20 Papanicolaou slides and 10 photographic slides were prepared. The sets were given to the cytotechnologists for evaluation and again one year later by courier. Results. Twenty-one percent of microscopes were repaired and 9 % replaced; reagents were distributed and laboratory facilities improved. Only 16 % of cytotechnologists passed the initial proficiency test. Cytotechnologists received a refresher training course: one year later 67 % of them passed the proficiency test. To ascertain that each slide was correctly diagnosed, 41 sets were rescreened by expert cytopathologists or cytologists and their diagnoses compared to the original ones.

40|$|The {{literature}} part of {{this thesis}} consists of a review of recently introduced forms of solid phase microextraction (SPME) : thin film microextraction (TFME), in-tube solid phase microextraction(IT-SPME) and the closely related techniques of capillary in tube adsorption trap/solid phase dynamic extraction (INCAT/SPDE). The experimental part covers the study of reagents for on-fiber derivatization of low molecular weight aliphatic amines in atmospheric concentrations. In TFME a thin film of sorbent is used for extraction instead of a rod-like sorbent as in fiber-SPME. This increases analyte uptake and capacity compared to fiber-SPME, making TFME suitable for non-equilibrium extraction. TFME is used with both gas and liquid chromatography, although the large size of the film presents problems in desorption, especially in gas chromatography. Common applications of TFME are environmental monitoring and in vivo extraction. IT-SPME is a dynamic type of SPME most often coupled with liquid chromatography, in which a liquid sample is pumped through an extraction capillary. It is relatively easily automated with most autosamplers. In {{the most common form}} a sorbent is coated on the inside walls of the capillary. Recently, packed types of IT-SPME have been introduced, which can achieve very high extraction efficiencies. In addition, sorbent materials which change their properties according to environmental factors such as temperature, potential and magnetic field seem promising for future development. INCAT/SPDE utilizes internally coated metal needles for extraction. Although similar to IT-SPME, it is used for sampling gaseous compounds by pumping them through the needle. Desorption and analysis is usually performed with a gas chromatograph. INCAT/SPDE has some advantages over fiber-SPME, such as larger sorbent volume and robustness. However, it is currently limited to only polydimethylsiloxane-based sorbents, which limits possible applications. In the experimental part, the possibilities of using allyl isothiocyanate, pentafluorobenzaldehyde(PFBAY) and pentafluorobenzyl chloroformate (PFBCF) in simultaneous extraction and on-fiber derivatization of low molecular weight aliphatic amines were explored. Separation and analysis was performed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Allyl isothiocyanate did not derivatize the analytes. On-fiber derivatization with PFBAY was successful for both ethylamine and methylamine, but the concentrations required to observe signal from the derivatives were too high to use PFBAY for air samples. PFBCF was identified as the most promising <b>reagent,</b> <b>working</b> for both dimethylamine and ethylamine. It was also possible to construct a calibration function for gaseous dimethylamine...|$|R

40|$|A fluorometric ultramicromethod for the {{determination}} of calcium in serum, plasma, spinal fluid, and urine is described. All the reagents, which are premeasured and prepackaged for each determination, are stable indefinitely at room temperature. HE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER 5 to describe a micromethod for the fluorometric determination of calcium in blood serum, plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. The method is an adaptation of the fluorometric procedure of Wallach et al (1, 2) and Kepner and Hercules (3) to the TJnopette system * (4, s). The original procedure involved the preparation of a stock solution of Calcein or fluorescein complexone, 1 mg/ml, in 0. 8 N potassium hydroxide. This solution is stable 30 days at 4 #{ 176 }. The <b>working</b> <b>reagent,</b> prepared to contain 33 g of Calcein or fluorescein complexone in 5 ml of 0. 8 N potassium hydroxide is stable only 4 -I days at room tempera-ture. The reagents in the Unopette system adaptation of the procedure are stable indefinitely at room temperature. All the reagents for a single determination are premeasured and prepackaged: 5. 0 ml of the 0. 8 N potassium hydroxide in a Unopette reservoir, and 35 g of Calcein in dry form in a 2 O-j. ml Unopak. The Calcein and sample {{are added to the}} diluent simultaneously. The procedure is outlined in Fig. 1...|$|E

For that purpose 25  μl of diluted standard and sample (1 : 10 in PBS) {{were added to}} 200  μl of colorimetric <b>working</b> <b>reagent</b> and incubated for 30  min at 37  °C. Optical density was read at 562  nm using a microplate reader. 8 % polyacrylamide gels were co-polymerized with 1  mg/ml gelatin (Type A: from porcine skin, Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland). Separation of 750  μg protein/lane was done under non-reducing conditions on ice. Purified MMP- 2 and proMMP- 9 (Chemicon, Billerica, MA, USA) were used as positive controls. Subsequent renaturing of the protein {{was carried out by}} 30  min incubation in freshly prepared 2.5  % Triton X- 100 solution followed by incubation in enzyme activation buffer (50  mM TRIS–HCl, 200  mM NaCl, 5  mM CaCl; pH 7.5) overnight at 37  °C where the buffer was exchanged after the first 30  min. Subsequently gels were washed in ddH 2 O, stained in 0.1  % Coomassie Blue solution (50  % methanol, 10  % acetic acid, 0.1  % brilliant Blue R 250 in ddH 2 O) for 2  h and destained for 20  min in destaining solution (10  % acetic acid; 20  % ethanol in ddH 2 O).

40|$|Before {{starting}} the test, aspirate some <b>working</b> <b>reagent</b> into the flow cell, wait about 1 mm, then purge the cell. This manipulation effectively ob-viates contamination in the cuvette and connecting tubings. First, run 100 L of ammonia-free, de-ionized, dis-tilled water as reagent blank, then the 143 molJL standard. After the stan-dard is read, the microprocessor will compute the factor {{by using the}} kinetic substrate program: Factor = CI(AS- LA 1) The subsequent sample readings will be recorded by the microprocessor and the final result computed in micro-moles per liter: = Factor x (L 4,- LAb) = concentration of stan-dard = concentration of un-known = absorbance change of standard per minute = absorbance change of unknown per minute Mb = absorbance change of reagent blank per min-ute Absorbance and ammonia concentra-tion are linearly related up to 430 tmoIJL when aqueous standards are used. For comparison, we used the centrif-ugal analyzer method as described pre-viously (1). Regression parameters for the 40 plasma samples by the Roto-Chem hA (x) and the Gilford 102 meth-od (y) were: slope 1. 035, y-intercept 1. 42, {{standard error of estimate}} 13. 5, and correlation coefficient 0. 996.

40|$|To measure {{glycogen}} in muscle {{of developing}} chick embryos, a simple colorimetric method, sensitive in the microgram range, was desired. Samples of skeletal muscle, 20 - 40. g wet weight, were dissected from frozen-dried sections of forelimb and contained from 0. 05 - 0. 1 g of glycogen. In principle, Seifter’s (8) methods based on Dreywood’s (1) anthrone reagent were {{adapted to the}} small sample size by microanalyti-cal techniques devised by Lowry (6, 7). By the procedure that follows, measurement of 0. 05 g of glycogen within ± 10 % was possible. MATERIAL AND METHODS Since the anthrone reagent is sensitive to all forms of polysaccharide, particular care was taken to avoid contamination by filter paper, dust or cotton. To prepare the reagent commercial anthrone was washed with redistilled water, dis-solved in absolute alcohol and filtered through sintered glass. About half of the solvent was evaporated with the aid of an aspirator and the solution was then stored at- 20 #{ 176 }C. In about 12 hours, when large needle-shaped crystals had formed, alcohol was decanted and the crystals were dried at 80 #{ 176 }C. Commercial glycogen was repurified (9) to remove any filter paper “floaters. ” The <b>working</b> <b>reagent,</b> 0. 2 % anthrone in 77 % sulfuric acid, was prepared before every deter-mination: 20 mg recrystallized anthrone was dis-solved in 5 ml concentrated sulfuric acid, then diluted to 10 ml with 60 % (v/v) sulfuric acid.

40|$|Introduction: In the HIV- 1 infection, the {{increase}} in number of CD 4 T lymphocytes and the viral load decline are the main indicators {{of the effectiveness of}} antiretroviral therapy. On average, 85 % of patients receiving effective treatment has a persistent suppression of plasma viral load below the detection limit (< 50 copies/mL) of clinically used viral load assays, regardless of treatment regimen in use. It is known, however, that, even when viremia is reduced below the sensitivity limit of current diagnostic assays, the virus persists in “reservoirs” and traces of free virions can be detected in plasma. There is a considerable interest to investigate the clinical significance of residual viremia. Advances in molecular diagnostics allows nowadays to couple a wide dynamic range to a high sensitivity. The Abbott Real-time HIV- 1 test is linear from 40 to 107 copies/mL and provides, below 40 copies/mL, additional information such as “< 40 cp/mL, target detected” or “target not detected”. The HIV- 1 detection is verified by the max-Ratio algorithm software. We assessed the test sensitivity when the qualitative response is considered as well. Methods: A ‘probit’ analysis was performed using dilutions of the HIV- 1 RNA <b>Working</b> <b>Reagent</b> 1 for NAT assays (NIBSC code: 99 / 634), defined in IU/mL and different from that used by the manufacturer (VQA,Virology Quality Assurance Laboratory of the AIDS Clinical Trial Group) for standardization and definition of performances. The sample input volume (0. 6 mL) was the same used in clinical routine. A total of 196 replicates at concentrations decreasing from 120 to 5 copies/mL, in three different sessions, have been tested. The ‘probit’ analysis (binomial dose-response model, 95 % “hit-rate”) has been carried out on the SAS 9. 1. 3 software package. Results: The sensitivity of the “< 40 cp/mL, target detected” response was equal to 28, 76 copies/mL, with 95 % confidence limits between 22, 19 and 52, 27 copies/mL. Conclusions: With the protocol of 0. 6 mL, the Abbott RealTime test is able to detect viral concentrations down to 29 copies/mL. A further sensitivity increase below the current threshold is likely to be reached through the adoption of experimental protocols based on increased input volumes in order to improve significantly assay precision at low viremia level...|$|E
40|$|Detection of {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) RNA in samples of plasma/serum {{has become an}} essential part of the diagnosis and management of HCV-infected patients. Qualitative HCV-RNA tests are used to identify acute HCV infections as well as chronic HCV carriers. In recent years,a variety of commercial and non commercial test systems have been developed for this purpose. Each of these methods is calibrate with proprietary standards and exhibits its own sensitivity (detection limit) and specificity. Obviously, laboratories performing HCV-RNA test should report accurate and reliable results regardless of the type of assay used. Where commercial kit are used for part of or the complete analytical procedure, documented validation points already covered by the kit manufacturer can substitute for the validation by the user. Nevertheless, the performance of the kit with respect to its intended use has to be demonstrated by the user. One of the best ways to assess the performance of individual laboratories for validation of qualitative HCV-RNA test is determine: 1. Specificity. In order to validate the specificity of the analytical procedure, at least 100 HCV-RNA-negative plasma pools should be tested and shown to be non-reactive. 2. Positive cut-off point (detection limit/sensitivity). The positive cut-off point (as defined in the Ph Eur General Method 2. 6. 21) is the minimum number of the target sequences per volume sample which can be detected in 95 % of test runs. A dilution series of a <b>working</b> <b>reagent</b> or reference material, which has been calibrated against the WHO HCV International Standard (96 / 790), should be tested on different days to examine variation between test runs. At least 3 independent dilution series should be tested with a sufficient number of replicates at each dilution to give a total number of 24 test results for each dilution to enable a statistical analysis of the results; 3. Robustness. To demonstrate robustness, at least 20 HCV-RNA negative plasma pools (selected at random) and spiked with HCV-RNA to a final concentration of 3 times the previously determined 95 % cut-off value should be tested and found positive; 4. Cross-contamination error. Cross-contamination prevention should be demonstrated by the accurate detection of a panel of at least 20 samples consisting of alternate samples of negative plasma pools and negative plasma pools spiked with high concentrations of HCV (at least 102 x the 95 % cut-off value or at least 104 IU/ml) ...|$|E
