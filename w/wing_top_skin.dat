40|$|International audienceThis paper {{tends to}} study the {{observed}} piercing force of sandwich panels with foam cores under impact loading by numerical and analytical methods. For this purpose, numerical models are built using LS-DYNA and calibrated with the inversed perforation test instrumented with an instrumented pressure bar on the AlSi 7 Mg 0. 5 Aluminum foam core sandwich panels with 0. 8 mm thick 2024 T 3 Aluminum <b>top</b> and bottom <b>skins.</b> Actually, the proposed numerical model can predict piercing force vs. displacement curves in good agreement with experimental measurements (tests at impact velocities at 27 and 44 m/s). More confidence is obtained {{by the fact that}} the simulation can also reproduce the failure mode of the <b>top</b> <b>skin</b> and bottom skin. Virtual tests using this numerical model are conducted with higher impact velocities up 200 m/s. A continuous increase of the piercing force of <b>top</b> <b>skin</b> with impact velocity is found. A careful analysis of numerical results (difference between <b>top</b> and bottom <b>skin</b> perforation, stress level beneath the <b>top</b> <b>skin,</b> etc.) shows that the foam core strength enhancement due to shock front propagation is responsible for this piercing force increase under impact loading. Finally, an analytical model using an improved RPPL shock model based on a power law densification assumption is proposed to calculate the <b>top</b> <b>skin</b> piercing forces. This analytical model provides a prediction in good agreement with the experimental and FE results in a large range of impact velocities...|$|R

In order to understand the origin of these force enhancements, any difference of detailed local information between static and dynamic loading is studied and showed that a shock front effect is responsible for the enhancement piercing force. An analytical model using an improved RPPL shock model based a power law densification assumption is proposed to calculate the <b>top</b> <b>skin</b> piercing force. The improved RPPL shock model agrees with the FE results for small velocities and gives better prediction of the piercing force than the RPPL shock model for large velocities (> 100 [*]m/s) ...|$|R

5000|$|The ring-repique is a {{percussion}} instrument {{originated in}} Brazil. It's a small drum commonly made of aluminum, {{and unlike the}} Hand-repique, has two drumheads (top and bottom, commonly made out of animal skin), and a different, much deeper timbre. In Brazil this instrument is used mainly to play Samba and its variants, such as Pagode. The ring-repique has this name because traditionally, the musician wears one or more rings to play it, striking {{the body of the}} instrument with his fingers and using his thumb to play on the bottom or <b>top</b> <b>skins.</b> Normally the free hand hits the <b>top</b> <b>skin,</b> and this technique allows the player to perform more than one rhythm. The ring-repique was invented in the 1970s by musician [...] "Doutor".|$|R
50|$|Ordered on 18 June 1928, it was {{intended}} to be fast and maneuverable enough to win a dogfight. The XP-10 used a gull <b>wing</b> <b>top</b> <b>wing,</b> joined at the fuselage; this offered much better pilot visibility than the traditional biplane configuration. Coincidentally, this also permitted the wing and fuselage to meet at the optimum angle for minimizing drag. The wings were plywood-covered (rather than doped fabric, as used in World War I), and the fuselage was fabric-covered steel tubing.|$|R

50|$|The outer skins: If the {{sandwich}} is supported on both sides, and then stressed {{by means of}} a downward force {{in the middle of the}} beam, then the bending moment will introduce shear forces in the material.

The thicker the core material the stronger the composite. This principle works in much the same way as an I-beam does.|$|R
