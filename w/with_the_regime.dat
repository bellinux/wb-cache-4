5|$|Among {{the mass}} protests that {{occurred}} {{at that time}} were the winter 1981 general strike in Bielsko-Biała, the nationwide warning strike {{in the spring of}} that year and hunger demonstrations in summer. The warning strike took place {{in the aftermath of the}} Bydgoszcz events (March 1981), during which the authorities resorted to violence to suppress Solidarity activists. The planned general strike was called off after Solidarity's questionable deal with the government, but the negotiators worked under a threat of Soviet intervention. Wałęsa's compromise prevented a confrontation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> or its foreign allies, at the price of the protest movement's loss of some of its dynamics. During the months that followed Solidarity kept getting weaker and its popular support was no longer capable of mass determined action.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the 22 Floréal coup in France {{undermined}} Delacroix, {{because it}} inspired more sympathy by French foreign minister Talleyrand for the Dutch opposition members who demanded the ambassador's recall. At the same time, Daendels became disaffected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> {{he had helped}} put into power because of the depredations of the purging commissions. His French colleague General Joubert was displeased with the radicals because of conflicts about the co-dominion of Flushing. Finally, the newly appointed Agenten were disturbed about the inefficiency of the Uitvoerend Bewind. All these disaffections came together with the putsch on June 12, 1798, of that recidivist, general Daendels, in which he disturbed a dinner party of Delacroix and {{three members of the}} Uitvoerend Bewind, violating the diplomatic immunity of the ambassador by putting pistols to his chest. The members of the Representative Assembly were arrested in session.|$|E

25|$|Under {{leadership}} of José María Valiente and with consent of Don Javier, the collegial Carlist executive commenced cautious collaboration <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime.</b> It {{is not entirely}} clear how this major change of policy was related to appearance of prince Hugues. According to one theory, the young entourage decided to introduce him banking on a new strategy and posing to present an offer to Franco. According to another, with new long-term perspectives related to his son opening, Don Javier changed course hoping that the regime might one day crown the young prince. One more reading {{has it that the}} changing political course and the introduction of Hugues coincided as results of two independent processes. One way or another, starting 1957 Don Javier was gradually permitting his son to assume more and more roles within Carlism.|$|E
25|$|After Stalin's {{death in}} 1953, the Soviet Union pursued {{a program of}} destalinization that was inimical to Rákosi, leading to his deposition. The {{following}} political cooling saw the ascent of Imre Nagy to the premiership, and the growing interest of students and intellectuals in political life. Nagy promised market liberalization and political openness, while Rákosi opposed both vigorously. Rákosi eventually managed to discredit Nagy and replace him with the more hard-line Ernő Gerő. Hungary joined the Warsaw Pact in May 1955, as societal dissatisfaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> swelled. Following the firing on peaceful demonstrations by Soviet soldiers and secret police, and rallies throughout the country on 23 October 1956, protesters {{took to the streets}} in Budapest, initiating the 1956 Revolution. In an effort to quell the chaos, Nagy returned as premier, promised free elections, and took Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact.|$|E
25|$|Already {{during the}} Civil War Caylà was commemorated in a hagiographical booklet {{published}} in 1938, presenting him as {{champion of the}} Catholic, national and anti-bolshevik cause. Following the nationalist conquest of Catalonia in 1939 Caylà and other executed or fallen vallencs were re-buried in the newly constructed Panteó dels Mártirs on the Valls cemetery. A street in the old town was named after him and it remains so until today. In the 1940s Caylà remained a hero of the Tarragona Carlists, serving {{as a role model}} for the branch opposing Francoism and for those who chose to side <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime,</b> supporting the claim of self-styled claimant Carlos VIII. Juventud, the Falangist weekly launched in Tarragona in 1943 was styled as continuation of Joventut; issued in Spanish and subtitled Semanario nacional sindicalista it had little in common with the original Caylà's periodical.|$|E

While the CNT opted for a radical confrontation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime,</b> and were prohibited on this account, the UGT, although in disagreement with the dictatorship, adopted a collaborative attitude in order to continue to operate legally. The radicalization during the period of the Second Spanish Republic of the wing led by Francisco Largo Caballero, when the UGT surpassed a million members, and the bloody breakout of the Spanish Civil War deepened the internal fissures that resulted in the departure of Largo Caballero from the position of UGT secretary general in 1937.|$|E
25|$|As late as 1966 Don Javier went on courting Franco, but {{the years}} of 1967-1969 re-defined his {{relation}} with Carlism and with Spain. In 1967 he had accepted resignation of Valiente, the last Traditionalist bulwark in the executive, and entrusted political leadership of the Comunión {{to a set of}} collegial bodies, all dominated by Hugocarlistas; the move marked their final victory in struggle to control the organization. In 1968 Carlos Hugo was expelled from Spain; in a demonstrative gesture, few days later Don Javier flew to Madrid, shortly to be expelled – for the 5th time - as well. This episode marked the end of an increasingly sour dialogue <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> and the Carlist shift to unconditional opposition; Don Javier would never return to Spain again. In 1969 the Alfonsist prince Juan Carlos was officially introduced as the future king and successor to Franco; the ceremony marked the ultimate crash of Bourbon-Parmas’ hopes for the crown.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of Hoveyda's premiership {{is marked by a}} sense of optimism. As already mentioned, in 1966, Hoveyda {{attempted}} to allure many elements of the intellectual community, as well as the opposition, into an informal agreement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime.</b> Although talks between the two sides eventually broke down, Hoveyda never lost sight of what a partnership between the two could have accomplished. His pragmatic approach to politics allowed him to envision an incremental reform process that can be carried out through action. This is contrary to the path assumed by many Iranian intellectuals at the time, which involved quixotic solutions to problems such as electoral corruption and media censorship. Hoveyda resumed many of the reform initiatives set out by the Mansour administration. In particular, reform plans that were laid out by the Shah in the White Revolution. Although a secularist, he would even allocate government revenue to the clerical establishment. The clerical establishment was seen as a bulwark against Communism by the Shah, and was constantly reinforced (a policy that the Shah would later regret).|$|E

25|$|Sextil Pușcariu's vacant {{seat at the}} Academy {{was taken}} up by {{literary}} historian George Călinescu, in May 1948. For the first two decades after his death, linguists largely avoided using Pușcariu's work in their publications. Dumitru Macrea cited him as early as 1956, followed by Romulus Todoran and, later, Emil Petrovici. However, other collaborators, many of them facing their own difficulties <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime,</b> did not bring up their former mentor; these included Capidan and Lacea, as well as George Giuglea and Silviu Dragomir. Work on the dictionary was moved to Bucharest, while the museum and Dacoromania were disbanded. There was a colloquium held about his life at the Brașov County Museum in 1977, to mark the centenary of his birth. His reputation did not fully revive until after the Romanian Revolution of 1989, with his rehabilitation embodied by an international conference held at Cluj-Napoca in 1998. For the community of Romanians living in exile from the communist regime, Pușcariu served {{as a symbol of}} refusal to serve the new authorities, and in this spirit, Alphonse Juilland published a series of Cahiers Sextil Pușcariu in Western Europe and in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Islamic {{political}} activism has a lengthy history in Egypt. Several Islamic political groups started soon after World War I ended. The most well-known Islamic political organization is the Muslim Brotherhood (Al Ikhwan al Muslimun, {{also known as}} the Brotherhood), founded in 1928 by Hassan al Banna. After World War II, the Muslim Brotherhood acquired a reputation as a radical group prepared to use violence to achieve its religious goals. The group was implicated in several assassinations, including the murder of one prime minister. The Brotherhood had contacts with the Free Officers before the 1952 Revolution and supported most of their initial policies. The Brotherhood, however, soon came into conflict with Gamal Abdel Nasser. The government accused the Brotherhood of complicity in an alleged 1954 plot to assassinate the president and imprisoned many of the group's leaders. In the 1970s, Anwar Sadat amnestied the leaders and permitted them to resume some of their activities. But by that time, the Brotherhood was divided into at least three factions. The more militant faction was committed to a policy of political opposition to the government. A second faction advocated peaceful withdrawal from society and the creation, to the extent possible, of a separate, parallel society based upon Islamic values and law. The dominant moderate group advocated cooperation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime.</b>|$|E
25|$|Earl Richard {{was one of}} the Lords Appellant, {{the leaders}} of the baronial {{opposition}} to Richard II, and was executed in 1397. Burley's activities during these momentous events seems to have been entirely routine. In July 1397, immediately after Arundel's arrest, Burley was involved in some sort of deal with John Eyton that required a reciprocal agreement to pay each other a substantial £200 the next Michaelmas. Later in the year he is recorded taking recognizances as usual, including an undertaking from William Glover of Ludlow for £60. Business continued, with other smaller clients employing him, along with his usual colleagues. On 7 March 1398 he and Thomas Young were among the feoffees appointed by Isabel de Eylesford to deal with her manors of Brimfield, Herefordshire, and Buildwas, Shropshire: a licence to complete the business by reciprocally enfeoffing Isabel was not issued until April 1402, long after the looming power struggle had reached conclusion, and problems at Brimfield delayed completion until February 1403, by which time Isabel was remarried. Such legal complexities unfolded to an entirely different rhythm from politics. An almost adjacent entry in the Patent rolls for show of 4 Februarys how delicately the king, evidently worried by spreading disaffection, was handling Shropshire people affected by Arundel's attainder. In this case, in an issue that might have been initiated by Burley, the king ensured that an Oswestry brewer would not be out of pocket, as he had invested heavily in premises granted by Arundel. Burley's own position <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>régime</b> seems to have been little affected and he was reappointed as a justice of the peace on 16 September 1398, after a lapse of little more than a year: {{more or less the same}} interval as previously.|$|E
50|$|Soon after, however, in May 1944, Hernández Martínez was deposed by the Strike of Fallen Arms led by students.

During this massive political action, Salvadoran society was completely paralysed until he was deposed.
