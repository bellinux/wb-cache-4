This count <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same as the one taken in 2010, which in turn was a {{decrease}} from the count taken in 2009, when RE2's AADT count was 440vehicles.

5|$|In {{a series}} of {{published}} and unpublished studies in the 1930s, Whorf argued that Mayan writing was to some extent phonetic. While his work on deciphering the Maya script gained some support from Alfred Tozzer at Harvard, the main authority on Ancient Maya culture, J.E.S. Thompson, strongly rejected Whorf's ideas, saying that Mayan writing lacked a phonetic component and is therefore impossible to decipher based on a linguistic analysis. Whorf argued that it <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> reluctance to apply linguistic analysis of Maya languages that had held the decipherment back. Whorf sought for cues to phonetic values within {{the elements of the}} specific signs, and never realized that the system was logo-syllabic. Although Whorf's approach to understanding the Maya script is now known to have been misguided, his central claim that the script was phonetic and should be deciphered as such was vindicated by Yuri Knorozov's syllabic decipherment of Mayan writing in the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Loxton {{had scored}} 203 runs in three innings {{at an average}} of 101.50, but was not selected, nor was middle-order batsman Harvey, who had scored a century in the {{previous}} Test against India. Harvey struggled to adapt to English conditions at the start of his first tour and made only 83 runs at 16.60 in five innings on tour. Brown, who had scored 527 runs at 75.28 for the season so far, including three centuries in his last three innings, was played out of position in the middle-order, even though he had batted as an opener in every tour match other than against Worcestershire. Due to the rotation policy in the tour matches, only two of the three openers Brown, Morris and Barnes played in any one game while the other rested, except when Bradman tried to fit all three in a full-strength team by having Brown in the middle-order. The team <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same as for the opening fixture against Worcestershire.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Post {{columnist}} Dana Milbank {{wrote in}} his 2010 book Tears of a Clown, that Beck had been baited by Eiland-Hall to confirm {{the importance of the}} United Nations. Alexander Zaitchik came to a similar conclusion in his 2010 book Common Nonsense, and pointed out the discrepancy between Beck's criticism of the United Nations as part of a New World Order with Beck's subsequent reliance upon the WIPO where he chose to file the case. The case was cited by Jude A. Thomas in a 2011 article published in the John Marshall Review of Intellectual Property Law. In a discussion of the conflicts between freedom of speech and trademark, Thomas noted that panels of the UDRP have concluded website operators had fair use over domain names even in cases where the name in question <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> same as that trademarked by the individual filing the complaint to the WIPO.|$|E

25|$|Bonaparte {{planned to}} advance from the Ligurian coast {{to drive a}} wedge between Beaulieu's Austrian army to the {{northeast}} and Feldmarschall-Leutnant Michelangelo Alessandro Colli-Marchi's 21,000-strong Austro-Sardinian army to the northwest. Colli, an Austrian on loan to the Sardinian army, shared a personal friendship with Beaulieu. However, the Austrian government secretly warned Beaulieu not to trust his Sardinian ally. This made it difficult for the two allied leaders to agree on a joint strategy. Colli feared an attack that would split the allied armies, which <b>was</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> plan that Bonaparte was contemplating. He argued for the allied armies to concentrate in the center. But Beaulieu became convinced that the French intended to seize Genoa, and he intended to thwart that possibility with an attack of his own.|$|E

The aircraft's primary role was interception with a secondary ground-attack capability; the AdA had an commitment for 200 aircraft. The first aircraft was to be delivered in 1982.

In charge of operations opposite the First Area Army in Eastern Manchuria was Marshal K.A. Meretskov's First Far Eastern Front, whose objectives were to seize Jilin and cut off Manchuria from Korea. These orders would take Meretskov's forces through the vital centers of Mutanchiang and Harbin. Leading the drive to Mutanchiang would be A.P. Beloborodov's 1st Red Banner Army and N.I. Krylov's Fifth Army, fully half of their parent Front's combat strength.|$|E
25|$|Early {{reports of}} torpedo action {{included}} some dud hits, heard as a dull clang. In a few instances, Mark14s would strike a Japanese ship and lodge in its hull without exploding.

Ironically, a direct hit on the target at a 90 degree angle, as recommended in training, would usually fail to detonate; the contact pistol functioned reliably only when the torpedo impacted the target at an oblique angle.|$|E
