5|$|A {{water mill}} and Mill Hill were {{mentioned}} in a grant in 1544. Water power was in general use in Rivington and many houses including the hall had water-mills.

The foundations of <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a mill opposite Mill Hill Cottages on Rivington Lane, mill ponds, and a smithy were shown on the 1848 first edition Ordnance Survey map. Names such as Mill Hill and Mill Dam Wood also provide evidence of the former mill.|$|E

Italy manager Marcello Lippi showed enormous faith in Totti, assuring him during his rehabilitation that his spot in Italy's World Cup squad was secure and to focus on recuperating.

5|$|However, Ruiz died in Valparaíso, Chile {{soon after}} his arrival in the country. He {{reportedly}} had uremia and a urethral obstruction, both of which deteriorated into Fournier gangrene, which killed him soon after. Later speculation that Ruiz had been poisoned or killed has been countered by three facts: that Ruiz's brother, Mariano Ruiz Quiñones (who was the coordinator of the revolution in Curaçao), died of the same condition soon after (suggesting a genetic predisposition to it), that Betances had used a catheter on Ruiz before he left Saint Thomas to bring him some relief from his condition, and that Betances published a medical article in France twenty years later, in 1887, that discussed the condition, out {{of what he had}} described as many years of second-guessing <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> done to save Ruiz's life.|$|E
5|$|However, with Moltke crippled, Admiral Scheer {{decided to}} return to base. Though {{scouting}} units of the Grand Fleet made brief contact with the Germans on the morning of 25 April, no action followed, and the High Seas Fleet made it home without incident. At one point in the chase, however, a reversal of course by the Germans meant that the entire Grand Fleet was forced to reorient itself in the opposite direction, placing Battleship Division Nine in the van. The result was that, if an encounter between the two fleets had occurred, American battleships would have led the British fleet into <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the largest naval battle of the war.|$|E
5|$|The Falcons {{controlled}} {{the ball for}} 41 of 60 minutes. An inability to complete long passes, combined with fumbles, prevented the Buccaneers from taking <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a large early lead. Isaac Hagins' fumble to Atlanta's Tom Pridemore set up a 31-yard field goal. The Buccaneers maintained a halftime lead, despite having held the ball for only six minutes and 18 seconds in the first half. Falcon blitzing disrupted Doug Williams' passing, and Ricky Bell and Jerry Eckwood were held to 72 yards rushing. Eckwood's fumble led to Atlanta's go-ahead touchdown with 11:10 remaining. Bubba Bean's 60-yard run with 1:22 remaining clinched the game for the Falcons. A 69-yard Williams-led drive brought the Buccaneers to within three points with 28 seconds left, but the Buccaneers failed to recover the ensuing onside kick.|$|E

5|$|Vahan and his Byzantine commanders did {{not manage}} {{to deal with}} this mounted force and use the sizable {{advantage}} of their army effectively.

They never pushed their attacks and even when they obtained <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a decisive breakthrough on the fourth day, they were unable to exploit it. There appeared to be a decided lack of resolve among the Imperial commanders, though this may have been caused by difficulties commanding the army because of internal conflict. Moreover, many of the Arab auxiliaries were mere levies, while the Muslim Arab army consisted for a much larger part of veteran troops.|$|E
5|$|Back at Paramount, Cooper {{returned}} to a more comfortable genre in Ernst Lubitsch's romantic comedy Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (1938) with Claudette Colbert. In the film, Cooper plays a wealthy American businessman in France {{who falls in love}} with an impoverished aristocrat's daughter and persuades her to become his eighth wife. Despite the clever screenplay by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, and solid performances by Cooper and Colbert, American audiences had trouble accepting Cooper in the role of a shallow philanderer. After all, it succeeded only in the European market. In the fall of 1938, Cooper appeared in H. C. Potter's romantic comedy The Cowboy and the Lady with Merle Oberon, about a sweet-natured rodeo cowboy who falls in love with the wealthy daughter of a presidential hopeful, believing her to be a poor, hard-working lady's maid. The efforts of three directors and several eminent screenwriters could not salvage <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a fine vehicle for Cooper. While more successful than its predecessor, the film was Cooper's fourth consecutive box-office failure in the American market.|$|E
5|$|Then, after flying past McCudden in a head-on firing pass, Voss's Fokker was {{hit with}} bullets on the {{starboard}} side by Hoidge. Meantime, Rhys Davids had pulled aside to change an ammunition drum; he rejoined combat with a 150meter (500foot) height advantage over Voss's altitude of 450meters (1,500feet), and began a long flat dive onto the tail of Voss' triplane. At point-blank range, he holed the German aircraft end to end with his machine guns before turning. It wandered into his line of flight again, in a gentle westward glide; Rhys Davids again ripped the German plane as its engine quit. The aircraft missed a mid-air collision by inches. The British ace fired again. As the triplane's glide steepened, Rhys Davids overran him at about 300meters (1,000feet) altitude and lost sight of his opponent. From above, Bowman saw the Fokker in <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a landing glide, right up until it stalled. It then flipped inverted and nose down, dropping directly to earth. The resulting smash left only the rudder intact.|$|E

5|$|Having missed <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Chelsea's winning penalty, John Terry {{had to be}} consoled by his manager, Avram Grant. The Manchester United players {{formed a}} guard of honour for Chelsea, lining up in two {{opposite}} rows {{at the foot of}} the steps up to the presentation party and applauding as the Chelsea team – led by chief executive Peter Kenyon – walked through. As Didier Drogba had been sent off during the game, he was not allowed to collect his medal himself and it was given to Grant; when he returned to pitch level, Grant tossed his own medal into the crowd. After Chelsea's team received their medals, Munich air disaster survivor Bobby Charlton, who had captained United to the European Cup title in 1968, led his team up to collect their medals in his capacity as a club director. UEFA President Michel Platini presented both Kenyon and Charlton with commemorative plaques and medals, but Charlton declined to accept his medal; he later donated it to the club museum. When all the players had received their medals, Platini presented Manchester United with the trophy, which Rio Ferdinand – as team captain for the match – and Ryan Giggs – standing in for club captain Gary Neville – lifted together.|$|E

5|$|The new England manager Glenn Hoddle {{appointed}} Shearer captain for the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Moldova on 1 September 1996, and {{the player}} held onto the captaincy after scoring once in that match and {{twice in the}} following game against Poland. He scored a total of fivegoals in England's successful qualification campaign for the World Cup; adding strikes against Georgia and away to Poland to his tally. Shearer was sidelined {{for much of the}} 1997–98 season, but recovered to play in the World Cup finals. With Michael Owen replacing Teddy Sheringham as Shearer's strike partner, Shearer's return saw him score England's first goal of the tournament, in a 2–0 win over Tunisia, his only goal in the three group matches. England faced long-time rivals Argentina in the second round. Shearer scored a first-half equaliser from the penalty-spot before David Beckham was sent off early in the second half. In the final minutes of the game Sol Campbell headed in <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the winning goal only for the referee to disallow it due to Shearer having elbowed goalkeeper Carlos Roa. The scores tied 2–2, the game went to penalties. Shearer scored again, but England were eliminated after David Batty's shot was saved by the Argentina goalkeeper. This defeat ended England's participation in what was to be Shearer's only World Cup tournament.|$|E
