In his first full season, Hill benefited {{from the experience of}} his veteran French team-mate. He continued to impress as the season went on, and in San Marino Hill took the lead at the start, though he was passed by Prost and Senna and ultimately retired <b>with</b> <b>brake</b> failure. More bad luck struck him in Spain where he kept pace with Prost for most of the race only for his engine to fail.|$|E
5|$|Alonso {{returned}} to the team for the , where the engine was retuned to operate {{at a higher level}} of performance and the team introduced a range of aerodynamic updates including sidepod fins and a new front wing. However, Alonso and Button still qualified on the penultimate row of the grid ahead of the Manor Marussia drivers Roberto Merhi and Will Stevens. Both cars retired from the race with mechanical problems. The team did not score any points during the first round of flyaway races, struggling with poor reliability and a lack of engine performance; the Chinese Grand Prix was the only race where both cars were classified as finishing. Although Alonso repeated the team's best finish of eleventh place in Bahrain, any hope of improved performance was arrested with the start of the European season at the next round in Spain, where Button finished sixteenth and Alonso retired <b>with</b> <b>brake</b> problems.|$|E
5|$|The race saw two drivers {{out before}} the start lights even went out, as first Sebastian Vettel stopped on track during the warm-up lap with an engine failure before Jolyon Palmer pulled into the pit lane instead of lining up on the grid, {{suffering}} from a hydraulic failure. It {{was the first time}} in Vettel's career that he was unable to start a race. At the start, Rosberg pulled into the lead ahead of Hamilton, who came into contact with Valtteri Bottas and dropped back to ninth place. Both Bottas and Ricciardo damaged their front wings in the situation. Felipe Massa took advantage and moved into second behind Rosberg. Further back, Sergio Pérez and Carlos Sainz also made contact, leaving Sainz with a puncture and Pérez with front wing damaged and both had to pit for repairs. Daniil Kvyat and Nico Hülkenberg were two more victims of contact during the first lap. The order after five laps was Rosberg, Massa, Bottas, Ricciardo and Räikkönen, who took fourth a lap later. The same lap, Jenson Button retired with a failure of his energy recovery system. After yet another lap, Räikkönen moved ahead of Bottas as well into third. Hamilton recovered from his first-turn accident and soon moved ahead of Bottas as well, laying in fourth place on lap eight. On lap ten, Bottas received a drive-through penalty for his collision with Hamilton at the start. By lap eleven, Esteban Gutiérrez retired <b>with</b> <b>brake</b> failure, while his teammate Grosjean was in fourth place.|$|E

25|$|The {{first race}} {{of the season in}} Australia saw Irvine {{involved}} in a race ending first lap crash with Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve. At the next race in Brazil, he could only manage sixteenth place, having found his car difficult to drive. Two weeks later he finished a career high second place in Argentina, where Irvine challenged Villeneuve for the lead, who was suffering with a stomach ailment, and his car <b>with</b> <b>brake</b> problems. The result ended demands in the Italian press for Irvine to be sacked. A third place at the next race in San Marino, and another in Monaco two weeks later, gave Irvine his best string of finishes to date. At the Spanish Grand Prix Irvine finished only twelfth and was given a 10-second stop-go penalty, after he held up Olivier Panis and Jean Alesi when running a lap down.|$|E
25|$|As the European season began, {{new cars}} were {{launched}} as organisers {{were due to}} start enforcing new regulations for 1976 having allowed an easing in period over the first three races. There was a big talking point as the Tyrrell team entered a new P34 six-wheeler for Patrick Depailler. Depailler was on the pace and qualified third, behind Hunt and Lauda. Lauda, driving with broken ribs after an accident driving a tractor once again beat Hunt off {{the line at the}} start and led for the first third of the race. Depailler, after a slow start, was running fourth behind Mass when he spun off and crashed <b>with</b> <b>brake</b> problems. Just before mid-race, the McLarens of Hunt and Mass found another gear and drove past Lauda, but {{towards the end of the}} race, Mass had to retire with an engine failure.

25|$|After a seventh-place {{finish in}} the opening round in Bahrain, Button won the second race in Australia from fourth on the grid. Button {{was the first to}} come in for slick tyres on a damp but drying track, which lifted him to second place after the other drivers had pitted. He {{inherited}} the lead when Vettel retired <b>with</b> <b>brake</b> problems and maintained his lead to the end without changing his tyres again. His victory made him the thirteenth driver in Formula One history to have won Grands Prix for at least three different constructors. Following an eighth-place finish in Malaysia, after starting seventeenth, Button went on to win his second race of the season from fifth on the grid in China, by staying on slick tyres while most of the other drivers pitted for intermediates, he was promoted to second place. However, the rain did not come, and the other drivers had to pit again for dry tyres. Subsequently, he went on to lead the Drivers' Championship, with McLaren leading the Constructors' Championship.|$|E
25|$|Scuderia Toro Rosso were seventh overall, with Russian rookie Daniil Kvyat {{becoming}} the youngest driver to score points in Formula One, having finished ninth in Australia. Jean-Éric Vergne finished eighth in Canada, while Kvyat retired with a mechanical failure. Both drivers retired in Austria: Kvyat {{after suffering a}} rear suspension failure, and Vergne <b>with</b> <b>brake</b> issues. Both drivers recorded points in Britain. Vergne finished ninth in Hungary, while Kvyat missed the points. Kvyat finished ninth in Belgium, while Vergne was outside the points. Vergne recorded the team's best result {{of the season with}} sixth place in Singapore. Vergne took ninth in Japan, while Kvyat qualified a career-best fifth in Russia, but fell down the order with fuel consumption problems. Vergne originally took ninth in the United States, but was demoted to tenth after he incurred a five-second penalty following contact in an incident with Grosjean. Kvyat finished outside the points after taking a ten-place grid penalty for an engine change. Both Toro Rossos finished outside the points in Brazil and Abu Dhabi, bringing a disappointing end to both drivers' careers with the team.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} race, the Austrian Grand Prix, Montoya finally outpaced his {{teammate}} Ralf Schumacher in qualifying {{and took a}} career-best second. It looked better and better for him {{as he took the}} lead at the start and pulled away, with second-placed Ralf holding up a string of five cars behind him. But, after 10 laps, Schumacher retired <b>with</b> <b>brake</b> failure. Montoya was struggling with the same problems, and Schumacher had been told to hold the others up so that Montoya could build a gap. With Ralf Schumacher out, the five drivers, led by Michael Schumacher began to close on Montoya at over a second a lap. Soon Schumacher was right on Montoya's tail and tried to pass him around the outside at Remus Curve. Montoya kept on the inside, braked late, locked {{up and went to the}} gravel. Schumacher was also forced to go to the gravel to avoid Montoya. Montoya rejoined seventh, just behind Schumacher. Montoya went for an early stop which solved his problems. He was set for one point in sixth until he stopped on the track with a hydraulic failure. After the race, Schumacher said that 'all Montoya was doing was to try to take Schumacher out with himself off the circuit'.|$|E

25|$|When it restarted, Berger {{took the}} lead on track but Schumacher (who {{collided}} with Damon Hill, forcing the Briton in the Williams to stop for a new front wing) was still leading in the aggregate standings, with Berger, Häkkinen, Larini, Wendlinger and Katayama following. On the 12th Lap in total, Schumacher did take the lead on the circuit from Berger, but pitted immediately afterwards. When Berger stopped on lap 15, Häkkinen {{took the lead}} for McLaren. Berger retired on lap 17 with a suspension failure, whilst Häkkinen pitted a bit later, rejoining fourth. On Lap 21, Schumacher led (although driving behind Larini) on aggregate ahead of the Italian with Fittipaldi (who pitted on lap 23) in third, Häkkinen, Frentzen (who pitted a bit shorter as well) and Wendlinger making up the top six. From about lap 45 until lap 55, Damon Hill, Ukyo Katayama and Christian Fittipaldi battled for 5th, 6th and 7th, with first Fittipaldi and then Hill passing the Japanese in the Tyrrell on aggregate, Hill himself passed Fittipaldi on lap 49, only to lose the position two laps later. Fittipaldi did not finish the race; he retired <b>with</b> <b>brake</b> problems on lap 55. Damon Hill gained fifth, but lost it again to Katayama with two laps to go, and only kept a one-second lead over Heinz-Harald Frentzen to score the last point in the San Marino Grand Prix.|$|E
25|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before Saturday's qualification race. The first session, held on Thursday morning, lasted 40 minutes, {{while the second}} identically timed session, took place on Friday morning. Rosenqvist was fastest in the first practice session {{with a time of}} two minutes and 13.099 seconds which was recorded his final timed lap late in the session. He was four-tenths of a second quicker than the second-fastest driver Callum Ilott who moved out of traffic to drive with a clear track on his fastest lap. Kenta Yamashita was third-fastest, ahead of Juncadella and Norris; the latter held the fastest lap until ten minutes remaining in the session. Jake Hughes, Félix da Costa, Sims, David Beckmann and George Russell rounded out the session's top ten drivers. The session was stopped early for 16 minutes when Ferdinand Habsburg went into Fisherman's Bend corner too quickly and understeered into the turn's barriers, causing his car's left front corner to become lodged underneath the wall. Habsburg was transported to a local hospital for a precautionary check-up. As a result, the session was extended by five minutes to provide competitors with additional on-track time. Cassidy stopped his car on the front straight <b>with</b> <b>brake</b> problems while Mardenborough made a pit stop because his car's engine cover was becoming detached and the problem affected his vehicle's top speed, and Tadasuke Makino carried excessive speed turning into Lisboa Bend corner and damaged his car's front-left corner in an impact with the turn's exit barrier.|$|E

25|$|Sunday's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} held in the morning rather than starting at the traditional time of the beginning of the afternoon. Qualifying took place in dry and warm weather conditions. In the first group of five runners, Bird paced the session, ahead of Frijns. Prost and Piquet were third and fourth due to both drivers losing time through errors. Dvual had trouble selecting second gear, and ran deep into the first turn. He consequently finished as the first group's slowest competitor. Rosenqvist set a lap that immediately placed him the fastest driver in the second group, and finished in front of Turvey and Abt. D'Ambrosio and Félix da Costa were the second group's slowest participants. In the third group, Gasly set the fastest overall timed lap of any driver in the group stages at one minute and 2.080 seconds, and was one-tenth of a second faster than Vergne in second place. Di Grassi impacted the turn three exit barrier lightly en route to finishing third-fastest. Sarrazin and Evans finished the third group as its slowest competitors. In the fourth group, Heidfeld set a last minute lap time and his effort made him the fastest driver, ahead of Engel. Dillmann was third-fastest. After changing three car components, Lynn struggled <b>with</b> <b>brake</b> temperatures and could only muster fourth. Carroll was the fourth group's slowest driver following contact with the turn five exit barrier. At the end of group qualifying, the lap times set by Gasly, Rosenqvist, Vergne, Bird and Heidfeld were fast enough to enable them progression into super pole. Bird clinched pole position with a time of one minute and 2.285 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by Rosenqvist who recorded a lap 0.037 seconds off Bird's pace. Vergne locked his tires at the hairpin, which disrupted his rhythm through the following corners, but recovered enough time to qualify in third. Gasly went wide at the turn one hairpin, restricting him to fourth. Heidfeld's attempt was untidy, and could only muster fifth place. After qualifying, Frijns was demoted ten places on the starting grid because he changed his gearbox following his practice accident, and Piquet did the same after changing his engine.|$|E
