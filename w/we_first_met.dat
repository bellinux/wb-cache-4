500|$|... "Rehab" [...] is a mid-tempo R ballad with {{a subtle}} backbeat. According to the digital sheet music {{published}} by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, {{it is written}} in the key of G minor and set in common time, with a moderately slow groove. The vocal range spans nearly an octave {{and a half from}} F3 to B4. [...] "Rehab" [...] opens with a string section, played by Stevie Blacke, and a violin, cello, and tambourine instrumental groove with Hannon Lane's keyboard melody. Rihanna then sings the opening lines, [...] "Baby, baby, when <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> I never felt something so strong".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Walter goes through much development {{during the first}} season. Stuart believed that he changes {{the most out of}} the main cast, and his return to St. Claire's reflects this progression. Actor John Noble explained his character's evolution in a November 2008 interview, [...] "We see Walter from a different angle, very vulnerable. He goes back to the asylum again, and we see the very, very fearful man return for a while. Although he does have some wonderful moments earlier in the episode, when he goes back inside he turns into this incredibly fearful, stuttering fellow that we saw when <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> him. It's a very interesting journey we see Walter go through." ...|$|E
500|$|... Darwin's {{belief that}} black people had the same {{essential}} humanity as Europeans, and had many mental similarities, was reinforced by the lessons he had from John Edmonstone in 1826. Early in the Beagle voyage, Darwin nearly lost {{his position on the}} ship when he criticised FitzRoy's defence and praise of slavery. [...] He wrote home about [...] "how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against Slavery. What a proud thing for England if she is the first European nation which utterly abolishes it! I was told before leaving England that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration I am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro character." [...] Regarding Fuegians, he [...] "could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement", but he knew and liked civilised Fuegians like Jemmy Button: [...] "It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> here." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was true}} sorrow and sympathy in her face. I believe I should hardly have thought her ugly, if <b>we</b> had <b>first</b> <b>met</b> at that moment. Thus far, {{she had only}} amused me. I began really to like Miss Jillgall now.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned her}} head away, and offered me a little sketch, drawn {{throughout}} by her own pencil, of the summer-house in which <b>we</b> had <b>first</b> <b>met.</b> The paper trembled in her hand as she {{held it out to}} me--trembled in mine as I took it from her.|$|R
60|$|One day, {{a little}} while after this, Satan {{appeared}} again. We were always watching out for him, for life was never very stagnant when he was by. He came upon us at that place in the woods where <b>we</b> had <b>first</b> <b>met</b> him. Being boys, {{we wanted to be}} entertained; we asked him to do a show for us.|$|R
500|$|They reached Tierra del Fuego on 18 December 1832 and Darwin {{was taken}} aback at what he {{perceived}} as the crude savagery of the Yaghan natives, {{in stark contrast to}} the [...] "civilised" [...] behaviour of the three Fuegians they were returning as missionaries (who had been given the names York Minster, Fuegia Basket and Jemmy Button). He described his first meeting with the native Fuegians as being [...] "without exception the most curious and interesting spectacle I ever beheld: I could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilised man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement." [...] In contrast, he said of Jemmy that [...] "It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> here." [...] (Four decades later, he recalled these impressions in The Descent of Man to support his argument that just as humans had descended from [...] "a lower form", civilised society had arisen by graduations from a more primitive state. He recalled how closely the Fuegians on board the Beagle [...] "resembled us in disposition and in most of our mental faculties.") ...|$|E
2500|$|David Amram, {{first met}} Woody Guthrie in 1956. [...] In his {{report of the}} 2005 WoodyFest he remembers that meeting: [...] "Ever since that day <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> I have always hoped that someday I would {{get the chance to}} go to Okemah, but with my crazy {{schedule}} I never had the opportunity to do so. When I was invited to the festival, I realized that I would be finally be able to see his hometown, and be able to meet his sister, her husband and his remaining old friends from long ago who were still living there. By doing that, and by playing music and spending time with people who were also natives of Okemah, I knew that I would be able to understand Woody and his work in a deeper way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of {{her first}} adult movie, Randy West said [...] "Jenna {{contacted}} {{me and said}} she wanted to get into the XXX business, but her agent didn't want her to do porn. A month later I'm on a shoot in Woodland Hills , and there's Jenna. She {{said she wanted to}} get into the business, despite what her agent said. I told her if you want to just do a girl/girl scene, we can do that. She said she wanted to work with Kylie Ireland, so I set it up. When the sex started, she just fucking rocked! I knew Jenna was special right off the bat. I figured she'd be the next Ginger Lynn, but nobody had any idea {{she was going to be}} as big as she turned out to be. Jenna told me when <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> that she was going to be a star." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1996 Valdobrev {{married his}} high school love Jana. [...] "We have many shared {{memories}} as childhood sweethearts in Stara Zagora. We were 10 when <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met.</b> Our parents were coming back from an excursion, we {{got off the bus}} at the same station and headed in different directions. After a few meters I stopped and turned to look back. She had stopped too and was looking at me. We stood like that for a few moments, staring at each other, our parents holding our hands. Growing up with someone's memories and making that journey through adulthood together is probably what makes a relationship strong. No one knows me better than Jana." [...] In 1998 Jana gave birth to their daughter Maria. Three weeks after that Valdobrev had a terrible car accident that almost cost him his life and kept him immovable and out of action for a year. For that reason he couldn’t join Regis Wargnier’s Oscar-nominated film production East/West, for which he'd been cast to play opposite Catherine Deneuve and Sandrine Bonnaire.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with a What's on TV journalist, Morey said viewers relate to Sonya because she is [...] "pretty normal". The actress noted that Sonya is not glamorous and there is [...] "something quite humbling about her." [...] Morey {{went on to say that}} Sonya's heart is usually in the right place and she always tries to do the right thing for the right reasons. Of her character's development, Morey explained [...] "She has become a lot more self-assured and she has learnt to trust herself again. I think when <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> her, she was quite closed off and didn't want to let anyone in fear of hurting them." [...] Sonya decides to give up her job as a guide dog trainer to buy and turn the community garden into a garden nursery. Morey told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap that she thought that the garden was symbolic of what Sonya is doing in her personal life. She explained [...] "She made a lot of mistakes when she was younger. Now she just wants to plant beautiful things and watch them grow. She's very focused on that for now." ...|$|E

60|$|Long {{before the}} dawn I {{stood in the}} peach orchard, that orchard where <b>we</b> had <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> and waited. At length Marie came {{stealing}} between the tree trunks like a grey ghost, for she was wrapped in some light-coloured garment. Oh! once more we were alone together. Alone in the utter solitude and silence which precede the African dawn, when all creatures that love the night have withdrawn to their lairs and hiding places, and those that love the day still sleep their soundest.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{think in}} {{statistics}} and percentages, averages and exceptions. I wonder, when <b>we</b> <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> what particular formula you measured me up by." ...|$|E

60|$|So {{we talked}} {{as well as}} my sufferings would allow.

Thus we talked till midnight was two hours gone. Then there came a silence.|$|R

6000|$|When <b>first</b> <b>we</b> <b>met,</b> {{he really}} was [...] "as bonny as a girlie"; with his oval face, his flushed cheeks, his brown eyes, large and radiant, and his hair of a length more romantic than conventional.
