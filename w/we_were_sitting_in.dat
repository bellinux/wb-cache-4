500|$|Ragan, who was {{the leader}} before the fifteenth caution, {{described}} his frustration after being black flagged by saying, [...] "It was tough to swallow. Who knows {{what would have happened}} in that next lap? We had a top-five car [...] and we didn't finish in the top five, so that's a bummer. We had a car that could've won the Daytona 500. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> position and just didn't do it. This thing only comes around once a year, so I'll think about it until we throw the checkered flag on next year's Daytona 500. So it's tough, but there is a bright side– we finished, we got some points and we ran up front, but we just didn't get what we come down here to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Rakeysh {{said the}} {{following}} in a scriptwriter's conference {{conducted by the}} Film Writers Association in the year 2008, [...] "I was making a documentary called Mamooli Ram, on the missed revolution with Kamalesh Pandey. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a small hotel room in Nanded, drinking. We started singing songs, and we both realised we liked similar songs. And so Rang De Basanti was born. He was angry with the system, I was helpless with the system. We wanted to do so much. But we really can't do anything and it {{was born out of}} anger. He wrote a story called Ahuti, meaning sacrifice. Ahuti was about the armed revolution about India, between the years 1919 and 1931. It started with Ashfaqullah Khan, Ramprasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, went on to Chandrashekhar Azad and so on. We had this amazing screenplay called Ahuti, which we had also termed as The Young Guns of India, which started with a train robbery, Azad on a horse and so on. I said, [...] "let's do The Young Guns of India". We were going to go on the floor, and suddenly {{there were a couple of}} film on Bhagat Singh made. But they came and went. Not because they were good or bad films, not because they were written badly or not written so bad. I'm not being judgmental about them. And this is very important: because they did not reflect the sentiment of today's time. Nobody in the audience could identify with something which was past. It wasn't that there wasn't idea of patriotism in us, but it was sleeping somewhere. And you had to kind of relate to it in today's world. So a couple of bottles of vodka again, and three days later, with couple of vodkas down, Kamlesh ji comes up with 'You know what, I think I've cracked it'." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Ament's {{death in}} January 1909, Judson Smith's successor, Dr. James Levi Barton (1855–1936) {{wrote in an}} {{obituary}} published in The Congregationalist: The cruel and baseless attack made upon him [...] in this country by Mark Twain, in 1901, left a deep wound in his heart, {{in spite of the}} fact that it was clearly shown that his acts had been above criticism. He said one night, as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> a Chinese inn upon our way to Shansi, [...] "I presume there are many in the United States who regard me as little better than a thief and a robber." [...] I tried to assure him that no missionary was more honored than he, none more absolutely trusted, as it had been proven that the charges had no foundation in fact. He replied, [...] "That is true, but do the people believe the proof, and will the truth ever catch up with the charge?' ...|$|E

2500|$|The group {{originally}} {{consisted of}} four sisters. Farrah King (born [...] ), Neosha King (born [...] ) and twins Felisha and Fallon King (born [...] ). Originally from Maywood, Illinois, the four sisters moved to Atlanta, Georgia {{to begin their}} musical career. The girls stated {{that they have been}} a group since the oldest, Farrah, was two years old. The girls were also quick to start singing professionally, starting when Farrah was only seven years old. The group also stated, in an interview with MTV, that their father was the one that brought them together, as their parents were singers as well. When asked about where their name came from, the girls stated, [...] "It's funny because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> the hotel room {{trying to come up with}} a name for the group. My father, which is our manager asked us [...] "well what do you cherish?" [...] Do you cherish what you do? We said yes and that's how the name Cherish came about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Referee Hansson told Sveriges Radio Blekinge [...] "I cannot {{comment on}} the game itself but life must go on. I will ride this storm as well". In his first {{substantial}} {{comment on the}} incident, Hansson spoke to the regional Swedish newspaper [...] on 24 November. While repeating the fact that FIFA rules prevented him commenting on the game until the investigation concluded, he said the incident was neither his or his referee team's fault. Referring to a graphic illustration printed earlier in The Times and reproduced in some Swedish newspapers, he said [...] " [...] clears the whole refereeing team in this incident". The picture, titled 'Why the referee missed it', purported to show how neither the referee or the assistant referee could have seen the handball incident, due {{to the presence of}} three Irish players blocking Hansson's view from his position {{on the edge of the}} penalty area, and Irish goalkeeper Shay Given's position obscuring the sightline of the assistant referee, Nilsson, who was standing on the right hand touchline. He also stated that the reaction to the game had made him consider quitting his job as a referee. On 21 June, during the World Cup finals, Hansson said, [...] "After the game, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> the dressing room and I cried. I realized what a mistake it was." ...|$|E

60|$|At dinner-time the {{day when}} I had the {{conversation}} with Jone mentioned in my last letter, <b>we</b> <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> the dining-room at a little table in a far corner, where we'd never been before.
