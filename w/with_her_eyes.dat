5|$|The song's video {{features}} close-up {{shots of}} Beyoncé and incorporates psychedelic light effects and symmetrical filming photography. As the acoustic guitar begins playing, Beyoncé's face comes into view. She stands with {{her blond hair}} draped just below her exposed shoulders. As she intently stares into the camera, her skin glistens as though it has been coated with a honey-like and glittery substance. Turning her head from right to left, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed off-camera, Beyoncé starts belting out the first verse. As the chorus is reached, scenes of Beyoncé in a darkened room are shown. Additionally, she places her face delicately against dripping water, gently brushing it with her lips and palms. The scenery changes and Beyoncé {{is back in the}} darkened chamber, where she removes her dress.|$|E
25|$|After {{approximately}} {{two hours of}} captivity, Norris killed Ledford by strangling her with a wire coat hanger, which he tightened with pliers. Ledford did not react much to the act of strangulation, although she died <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> open. Bittaker then opted to discard her body on a random lawn in order to view the reaction from the press. The pair drove to a randomly selected house in Sunland and discarded Ledford's body in a bed of ivy upon the front lawn.|$|E
25|$|The next {{fountain}} is the Gerechtigkeitsbrunnen (German:Justice fountain) on Gerechtigkeitsgasse. Built in 1543 by Hans Gieng, {{the fountain}} is {{topped with a}} representation of Justice. She stands <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and ears bound, a sword of truth {{one hand and the}} scales in the other. On the pillar below her feet are four figures; the Pope, a Sultan, the Kaiser or Emperor and the Schultheiß or Lord Mayor. This represents the power of Justice over the rulers and political systems of the day; Theocracy, Monarchy, Autocracy and the Republic.|$|E

25|$|The {{witnesses}} {{described the}} Blessed Virgin Mary as being clothed in white robes {{with a brilliant}} crown on her head. Over the forehead where the crown fitted the brow, she wore a beautiful full-bloom golden rose. She was in an attitude of prayer <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and hands raised towards Heaven. St. Joseph stood on Our Lady's right. He was turned towards her in an attitude of respect. His robes were also white. St. John was on Our Lady's left. He was dressed in white vestments and resembled a bishop, with a small mitre. He appeared to be preaching and he held an open book in his left hand.|$|E
25|$|On September 7, 1927, Philo Farnsworth's image {{dissector}} camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. By September 3, 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. This {{is widely regarded as}} the first electronic television demonstration. In 1929, the system was further improved by elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts. That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma ("Pem") <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).|$|E
25|$|The {{left wing}} depicts the {{beheading}} of St John the Baptist. His headless body {{lies in the}} left foreground and seems to reach out of the picture, as blood spurts from his severed neck, spraying his hands and the nearby plants. The foreground in the flora are reduced {{to the extent that}} they could not have been painted without a magnifying glass. The executioner stands with his back to the viewer, placing the freshly severed head on Salome's platter. The executioner, Salome, and three gesticulating bystanders form a circle around John's headless and lifeless body. According to Ridderbos, the five figures mirror and create a sense of unity with the five holy figures in the central panel. The scene is set in a courtyard in front of Herod's palace; the banquet that preceded the Baptist's decapitation can be seen in the left-midground of the palace, where minstrels play for Salome's dance. The banquet is well-lit and with good architectural perspective. Albert Michiels described Salome as ravishing but emotionless; she receives the head, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> held aloof. Other versions of St John's beheading (decollation) more typically showed Salome holding an empty plate for the executioner; with an early version typified in a miniature in the Petites Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry.|$|E

500|$|The {{black-and-white}} {{music video}} was noted to have predominantly dark, brooding, hazy, mysterious and sun-stroked imagery, and portrays Del Rey evoking her distinguished personality. Using a minimalist and melancholy approach, it features several artistic shots of California scenery and cameo appearances {{by two men}} portrayed as bad boy archetypes. Del Rey engages in 1960s apparition, numerous swaying and twirling actions, and sings <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> closed throughout the music video. CBS Corporation writer Courtney E. Smith described the clip as [...] "the yin and yang of youthful hope, the kind Hollywood lives by attracting, and cynical industry, the kind Hollywood thrives on but hides".|$|E
500|$|In the song, the woman's {{addiction}} and misdirected desire for transcendence {{are reflected in}} lines such as [...] "She runs through the streets / <b>With</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> painted red" [...] and [...] "She will suffer the needle chill". [...] Bono's lyrics evoke helplessness and frustration in the lines [...] "You've got to cry without weeping, talk without speaking, scream without raising your voice". [...] The title phrase is not used until {{the last line of}} the song. [...] This compositional technique relies upon delayed gratification and is heard in a few other popular songs, such as the Cure's [...] "Just Like Heaven" [...] and George Michael's [...] "One More Try".|$|E
500|$|In Stockholm, Sweden, a {{group of}} identically dressed masked men, each handcuffed to a briefcase, are {{attacked}} in a subway. They are all killed, with one also having his hand cut off, and his briefcase taken. The attacker opens the briefcase and removes the box of diamonds it contains. Investigating the attack, Agent Phil Coulson discovers that the briefcases were randomly assigned, so no one knew which contained the diamonds, and that the attacker carried it out <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> closed. Civilian recruit and S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee Skye believes that extrasensory perception may be involved, but Coulson and Agent Melinda May doubt that such abilities exist. Using social media, the team discovers that the thief, who has been behind several other similar crimes, is former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Akela Amador. Coulson had trained Amador, and until now had believed her dead.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to praising Gellar's often under-appreciated acting, Buffy scholar Ian Shuttleworth {{comments on the}} cast and the nuanced numbness and confusion of the characters, paired with the moments of silence in the episode: [...] "It is simply {{one of the finest}} pieces of television drama, and the single finest depiction of bereavement in any medium, that I have ever seen." [...] Nikki Stafford, author of Bite Me! The Unofficial Guide to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, calls [...] "The Body" [...] "an absolute masterpiece", explaining that it is [...] "hands down the single most terrifying, heart-breaking, painful, and amazing hour of television I have ever seen". She praises the entire cast equally, but highlights Gellar, Alyson Hannigan, and Emma Caulfield. Stafford also praised Kristine Sutherland—as did Whedon—for having to lie motionless <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> open for hours upon hours over eight days of filming.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of Fanaa, Kajol worked {{intermittently}} {{through the rest of}} the decade. She next starred in her husband's directorial debut, the drama U Me Aur Hum (2008) as Piya, a woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Devgn described Kajol's participation in the project by saying, [...] "She is always thorough with the nitty-gritties of her character before she begins shooting. Since the screenplay work happened at home, Kajol was present for all the sittings and even gave her inputs." [...] Upon release, the film performed moderately well at the box office and earned positive critical reviews for her performance. Udita Jhunjhunwala noted, [...] "Kajol completely comes into her own here as an ailing woman unaware of her vulnerability and delicate situation. She is superb." [...] Raja Sen added, [...] " [...] can span through happy-breezy <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> closed, and so the first half doesn't even pose her a challenge, but when Alzheimer's strikes Piya and she begins to forget all that matters in her life, Kajol raises the bar strikingly high." [...] The following year, Kajol received another Best Actress nomination at the Filmfare Awards ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Most of the Weeping Angels are not statue props {{but young}} women wearing masks, costumes, and paint that took {{two to three}} hours to apply. Director Adam Smith called them [...] "an {{absolute}} nightmare to film with" [...] because {{it took a long time}} for them to get ready and they had to stand still for long periods of time. In the climactic scene Gillan had to walk <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> closed, which she said was difficult and challenging as the ground was uneven and muddy. She stated that [...] "it was the most scary thing" [...] when she had to trip over a step and fall, even though she was aware of the crash mat. As she was not able to express herself through her eyes, Gillan had to make herself more animated to convey emotion. The scene in which the Doctor, Amy and River are horizontal in mid-air when the gravity field fails on the Byzantium was achieved by using wires and powerful wind machines. The blue in Amy's bedroom was an idea of Adam Smith to show that it was inspired by the TARDIS from Amy's encounter with the Doctor when she was young.|$|E

500|$|... "West Coast" [...] {{served as}} the lead single from Ultraviolence. The song's title was first {{announced}} by the singer on April 3, 2014, on Facebook and Twitter. On April 10, 2014, Del Rey posted the track's single art on Twitter with the lyric, [...] "Down on the West Coast, they got a sayin'...", as its caption. The same caption was used in a promotional billboard which was put up in Los Angeles the same day. The heavily yellow artwork, which makes use of an Instagram filter camera lens, features Del Rey donning soft makeup while standing on a Californian coastline afront crashing waves. [...] She has a forlorn facial expression in the cover, and is depicted with a subtle frown <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> staring straight into the camera. Del Rey sports a beach-inspired look with a wave-like hair style, denim jacket and white shirt.

500|$|Max was genetically {{engineered}} and carried to term {{by a woman}} who was not permitted to meet her. She was created for a secret government supersoldier program called Manticore, then located in Gillette, Wyoming. As with almost all Manticore's soldiers, Max has a barcode on the nape of her neck, with her identifying number sequence (332960073452). She is an X5 model and is thus referred to as X5-452. Designed to be [...] "the perfect soldier," [...] Max is extremely strong, athletic and agile. She can see in the dark, can zoom in <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to view distant objects, does not need to sleep and has a photographic memory. She also has enhanced hearing, can leap up or down from great heights with ease, can hold her breath underwater for extended periods and can dodge bullets with her super speed. Max lies, cheats and steals when she needs to and shows no remorse when doing so, though she is morally opposed to guns. Max rides a Kawasaki motorcycle and enjoys riding at high speed. When she wants to be alone she sits atop of the derelict Space Needle. Max's forms 'family' bonds with her best friend and flatmate Original Cindy, her ally Logan Cale and her fellow X5 escapees. Upon escaping from Manticore, Max chooses the last name [...] "Guevara" [...] for herself.|$|E
500|$|Rhimes also {{described}} the difficulty she faced in finding an appropriate love {{interest for the}} character of Alex Karev: [...] "We kept meeting with people and it wasn't until we met Elizabeth Reaser and sat down with her, and in two seconds in {{realized that she was}} absolutely the one we'd been looking for." [...] Reaser explained that when she was cast, there were no definite plans for the development of her character, and that only the intrigue of the ferry accident had been explained to her. She also deemed her character [...] "frustrated and scared". As for the make up process, Reaser stated: [...] "The prosthetic changes your outlook on yourself. It can be very disorienting. It's intense." [...] Beers, however, noted that the focus on Ava was mainly due to her inability to express her feelings through facial expressions, only communicating <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and voice. Executive producer Rob Corn stated that his plan for the original arc was about Jane Doe's inner life, struggling {{to get out of the}} situation she is trapped in. He stated that the main characteristics they had been looking for in the actress for the part were strength and vulnerability. He also called Reaser's performance [...] "heart-wrenching and wonderful". Betsy Beers, the show's supervising executive producer, found Izzie to have been marked for life by Denny's death, which matured her [...] "in a very sobering way", but played a major role in making her feel more confident. She also noted the undeniable connection between Izzie and Alex Karev, whose desire to do honorable things has been compared with his [...] "cutting and sarcastic" [...] personality. After Izzie's continuous efforts to change Alex during their relationship in the previous season, Beers announced the possibility of a relationship between the two of them. She also contrasted the female leads on the show with women in film, explaining how the characters on television are shaped in unique ways.|$|E

500|$|Pfeiffer {{maintains}} {{that she has}} never received any formal acting training. Instead, she credits director Milton Katselas with teaching her the difference between how an actor initially thinks a character would behave during a particular scene, and how the actor themself would behave during that same scene. Vulture.com's Angelica Jade Bastién identified Pfeiffer as [...] "an actress of such depth, breadth, and tenacity, she obliterates the argument that an untrained actor has less capability than her trained counterparts." [...] In 1992, Rolling Stone Gerri Hirshey identified Pfeiffer as [...] "an accomplished character actress" [...] who is comfortable wearing costumes that are unflattering in the traditional Hollywood sense, The Fabulous Baker Boys Susie Diamond – her most critically acclaimed role to-date – being a notable exception at the time. Pfeiffer explained that she rarely accepts glamorous roles because she finds few of them interesting, opting to play characters that [...] "move" [...] her instead: [...] "I know that if I can hear the character as I'm reading, it's made some connection [...]" [...] A film critic once summarized the actress as [...] "a character actress in a screen siren's body", a sentiment with which her Scarface co-star and friend Al Pacino agrees. Pfeiffer is often commended for her ability to disguise her true feelings and emotions, a technique she frequently uses to her advantage in period films; playing roles in period costume {{has become something of}} a trademark of hers. Pfeiffer herself has admitted to being skilled in this particular area but at the same time believes that hiding one's true feelings is not uncommon, speculating, [...] "that's how most people behave. We may not be as mannered or as proper as people were in the 19th century, but very rarely are we talking about what we're really thinking." [...] Pfeiffer has called acting a [...] "sadomasochistic" [...] profession due to how [...] "brutal" [...] the process can be at times. She is often praised for her acting abilities by various directors with whom she has collaborated over the years. Director Martin Scorsese described Pfeiffer, who he directed in the period drama The Age of Innocence (1993), as [...] "an actress who could portray inner conflict <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and face better than any other film star of her generation." [...] Jonathan Demme (Married to the Mob, 1988) declared “It’s hard for me to imagine anyone who, on a level of quality, would have an edge on her." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a January 20, 2004 {{interview}} with magazine Soap Opera Weekly, Havins briefly described her audition {{and how she}} secured the role: [...] "I missed {{the first round of}} auditions, and the casting director called my manager and said, 'How come I think this girl's perfect?' And she said, 'Because Alexa can play trash <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> closed' (laughs)." ...|$|E
