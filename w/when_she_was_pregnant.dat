5|$|A popular legend imbues {{the birth}} of Ralambo with a mystical character. The legend relates that his mother, who was known in her youth as Ramaitsoanala ("Green Forest"), was the {{daughter}} of the Vazimba water goddess Ivorombe ("Great Bird"). With the assistance of her celestial mother, Ramaitsoanala confronted and overcame numerous obstacles. After her marriage to Andriamanelo (whereupon she assumed the name Queen Randapavola), one of these obstacles took the form of reproductive difficulties: six consecutive times Randapavola miscarried or lost her children in infancy. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant</b> with her seventh child, the queen was especially afraid for her unborn child because the number seven was traditionally associated with death. This time, Randapavola sought the guidance of an astrologer to protect the unborn child from an evil fate. On his advice she chose to defy the tradition of delivering the baby at her parents' home village of Ambohidrabiby, rather choosing the village of Alasora, to the north of Antananarivo, because this cardinal direction embodied great power. According to the tale, the queen gave birth in a house built to resemble a boat (called a kisambosambo) evocative of the transoceanic origins of the Malagasy people. There, Randapavola took the name Rasolobe upon delivering a healthy son, Ralambo, {{on the first day of}} the first month of the year (Alahamady), the most auspicious date for {{the birth of}} a sovereign.|$|E

The band then released a statement on their website declaring that the reason Olzon gave for her dismissal and other statements she made were untrue and that Olzon herself had agreed to help find a replacement while she was on maternity leave. Later on, Olzon gave several interviews in which she told that she never agreed with a replacement, even <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant,</b> and proposed to the band to postpone the tour, culminating on her firing. She also added that she was against Jansen joining the band in her period of maternity, mainly because of the difference in their vocal styles.|$|E
500|$|After dismissing Anthony Julius, a Mishcon de Reya lawyer, Mills stated {{she would}} {{represent}} {{herself in the}} upcoming divorce hearing, with help from her sister Fiona, David Rosen, a solicitor-advocate, and Michael Shilub, an American attorney. In leaked documents, Mills complained that McCartney was often drunk, smoked cannabis, stabbed her with a broken wine glass, pushed her over a table, and pushed her into a bathtub <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant.</b> Referring to her part in the marriage, Mills {{said that she had}} been a full-time wife, mother, lover, confidante, business partner and psychologist to McCartney. McCartney's lawyers studied Mills's book: Life Balance: The Essential Keys to a Lifetime of Wellbeing (2006), as it contradicted many of her claims, such as when she praised McCartney for [...] "Bringing me breakfast in bed every morning, no matter how he feels, and I do the dinner, so we've got that agreement. It's thoughtfulness". Mills's father reconciled with his daughter after meeting her and McCartney, when they introduced him to his granddaughter, Beatrice. After their separation, he said that it [...] "took guts to represent yourself at the High Court", and that he was proud of his daughter, even though he thought she would be [...] "torn to shreds" [...] by McCartney's lawyers.|$|E

500|$|Krøyer's Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach, one of {{the best}} known of his works, shows many of the Skagen artists {{standing}} around the traditional Sankt Hans Aften bonfire. He had been working on the huge painting (...) for years before he finally completed it in 1906. Marie is standing next to a fishing boat with her new lover, Hugo Alfvén, the Swedish composer, just {{to the left of the}} flames that seem to stream towards them. Despite Alfvén's affair with Marie, Krøyer had welcomed him to the house in Skagen and appeared to tolerate their relationship. The painting is Krøyer's last major work. The preparatory pastel sketch on which it is based was produced in a couple of hours, but the painting was completed with difficulty as not only had Krøyer spent several lengthy periods in a mental hospital from 1900 but he had also begun to lose his sight, particularly in one eye. He was not altogether happy with the finished product; he thought it had become [...] "too dark" [...] and felt it did not capture the [...] "pale radiance" [...] of the sky over Skagen on Midsummer Eve. Although it is an important work in the Skagens Museum collection it is not considered to be among the best of the group portraits produced by the Skagen Painters or even by Krøyer himself. In contrast, writing in Kristeligt Dagblad, Morten Rasmussen reports that the work is considered by many to be Krøyer's [...] "Magnum Opus", representing a reflection of his own life and a tribute to the people who contributed to his success. Marie left Krøyer for Alfvén in 1902, but it was not until 1905 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant</b> with Alfvén's child that Krøyer finally agreed to a divorce.|$|E

Leigh felt Suzy, although only 16 years old, should be making $40 per hour, and told Ford she would join her two-year-old agency only if they took Parker sight-unseen. Anxious to represent Leigh, they agreed.

2500|$|Irene married Prince Henry of Prussia, {{the third}} child and second son of Frederick III, German Emperor and Victoria, Princess Royal on May 24, 1888 at the chapel of the Charlottenberg Palace in Berlin. As their mothers were sisters, Irene and Henry were first cousins. Their {{marriage}} displeased Queen Victoria {{because she had}} not been told about the courtship until they had already decided to marry. At the time of the ceremony, Irene's uncle and father-in-law, the German emperor, was dying of throat cancer, and {{less than a month after}} the ceremony, Irene's cousin and brother-in-law, ascended the throne as Kaiser Wilhelm II. Heinrich's mother, Victoria, Empress Victoria, was fond of Irene. However, Empress Victoria was shocked because Irene did not wear a shawl or scarf to disguise her pregnancy <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant</b> with her first son, the haemophiliac Prince Waldemar, in 1889. Empress Victoria, who was fascinated by politics and current events, also couldn't understand why Heinrich and Irene never read a newspaper. However, the couple were happily married and they were known as [...] "The Very Amiables" [...] by their relatives because of their pleasant natures. The marriage produced three sons.|$|E

Many complications are observed for LGA babies and their mothers. A longer delivery time may be expected since it is a difficult birth.

2500|$|Barry Stuart-Hargreaves [...] (Series 1–7) (Barry Howard) Dancing Instructor – Barry {{was born}} Bert Pratt in Nottingham, {{the son of}} a bus inspector. By the late 1930s he was living in Sunderland where he met Yvonne and they began a brief affair, but she left him for another man. She later {{returned}} to him <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant,</b> and he proposed. He took Yvonne's last name, and changed his first name to Barry, for the sake of their careers. During World War II he was conscripted into the Royal Navy and served as a stoker, though it is presumed he did not do this for long as he and Yvonne became ballroom champions in 1942. After the war, he and Yvonne continued dancing, but their careers were drawing to an end, and in 1956 they joined Maplins as a last resort. He was often heavily criticised by Yvonne for his etiquette, a habit which annoyed him intensely. Although his official jobs were to teach dance and give ballroom demonstrations, Barry was regularly chosen against his will to be the victim of the campers in the entertainment events, such as getting covered in water while dressed as a granny, having spaghetti stuffed down his trousers, and dressing up as [...] "Percy the Pixie" [...] to entertain the children. Barry suffered from a bad back, and on one occasion during the 1959 season he was left unable to move after straining it. Yvonne called in Julian Dalrymple-Sykes to take his place in the ballroom until he recovered, though it was made clear that Barry already knew about Julian and his history with Yvonne. Barry left Yvonne and departed Maplins midway through the 1960 season, and it is unknown why he left or where he went. Throughout the series, several hints were made that Barry was actually gay, although this was never confirmed.|$|E
60|$|His brother Quintus {{was with}} him in Cilicia, but of his brother's doings there he says little or nothing. We have no letters from him during the period to his wife or daughter. The latter was married to her third husband, Dolabella, during his absence, with no {{opposition}} from Cicero, but not in accordance with his advice. He had purposed to accept a proposition for her hand made to him by Tiberius Nero, the young Roman nobleman who afterward married that Livia whom Augustus took away from him even <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>pregnant,</b> in order that he might marry her himself, and who thus became {{the father of the}} Emperor Tiberius. It is worthy of remark {{at the same time that}} the Emperor Tiberius married the granddaughter of Atticus. Cicero when in Cilicia had wished that Nero should be chosen; but the family at home was taken by the fashion and manners of Dolabella, and gave the young widow to him as her third husband when she was yet only twenty-five. This marriage, like the others, was unfortunate. Dolabella, though fashionable, nobly born, agreeable, and probably handsome, was thoroughly worthless. He was a Roman nobleman of the type then common--heartless, extravagant, and greedy. His country, his party, his politics were subservient, not to ambition or love of power, but simply to a desire for plunder. Cicero tried hard to love him, partly for his daughter's sake, more perhaps from the necessity which he felt for supporting himself by the power and strength of the aristocratic party to which Dolabella belonged.|$|E
