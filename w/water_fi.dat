To account for this fresh <b>water,</b> a <b>fi</b> rst hypothesis involves possible present-day active dynamic connections with onshore aquifers, while a second involves meteoritic and/or sub- ice-sheet waters during periods of lowered sea level. Expedition 313 drilled three boreholes on the middle shelf, offering a unique opportunity for the internal structure of the siliciclastic system to be accessed, at scales ranging from the depositional matrix to the continental margin. This enables the stratigraphic architecture to be correlated with the spatial distribution and salinity of saturating fl uids. Expedition 313 revealed both very low salinities (< 3 g/L) at depths exceeding 400 m below the seafl oor and evidence for a multilayered reservoir organization, with freshand/ or brackish-water intervals alternating vertically with salty intervals. In this study we present a revised distribution of the salinity beneath the middle shelf. Our observations suggest that the processes controlling salinity are strongly infl uenced by lithology, porosity, and permeability. Saltier pore waters generally occur in coarse-grained intervals and fresher pore <b>waters</b> occur in <b>fi</b> ne-grained intervals. The transition from fresher to saltier intervals is often marked by cemented horizons that probably act as permeability barriers.

40|$|Summary. The {{determination}} of induced magnetic fields of synoptic ocean movements is {{considered in the}} case of horizontal uniformity of the bottom conductivity. The problem of calculation of hydrodynamic parameters is solved by means of induced fields. These appear to depend closely on the appearance of barotropic or baroclinic parts in the synoptic ocean movement. The different properties of fields from parts of the above permit us to separate hydrodynamic parameters of complex ocean movements into baro-tropic and baroclinic parts by means of magnetic measurements. In recent years there has been great interest in the study of synoptic ocean movement. In this paper we investigate the possibility of determining the values of the hydrodynamical parameters of such movement by means of induced magnetic fields. The magnetic field induced by synoptic currents depends on the spatial and time variation of the water velocity and on the Earth's electrical conductivity structure. In the P-plane approximation, the vertical structure of the water velocity is controlled by ocean density stratification (Monin, Kamenkovich & Kort 1974). The vertical structure of the phenomenon outlined above is described by the following boundary-value problem, V'(0) = V'(h) = 0 where fo denotes the Coriolis parameter, N(z) denotes the Vaisala frequency, V denotes the vertical distribution of <b>water</b> velocity, <b>fi</b> 2 denotes the eigenvalue of equation (1). The plane z = 0 is situated {{at the bottom of the}} ocean;z = h corresponds to sea-level. The boundary-value problem has a number of fundamental functions V,, n = 0, 1, 2, [...] . where y 1 = 0 corresponds to the barotropic mode, y 1 > 1 corresponds to the baroclinic modes. Induced fields appear to depend closely on the structure of barotropic or baroclinic modes in the synoptic formation.

The research results indicate a positive economic effect of the irrigation system implementation because in our climate the water needs of a culture cannot be satisfied solely by precipitation, and thus water deficit occurs. This lack of rainfall causes yield reduction because it is the main parameter which increases the production profitability. Therefore, increasing the area under irrigation is very important...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater mapping in Denmark {{has high}} priority. It was {{initiated}} in the 1990 s when {{the pressure on}} groundwater resources increased due to urban development and pollution from industrial and agricultural sources. In some areas, the groundwater mapping included survey drillings, modelling based on existing knowledge and geophysical mapping with newly developed methods that made area coverage {{on a large scale}} possible. The groundwater mapping that included development of new geophysical methods showed promising results, and led to an ambitious plan to significantly intensify the hydrogeological mapping in order to improve the protec-tion of the Danish groundwater resources. In 1999 the Danish Government initiated the National Groundwater Mapping Programme with the objective to obtain {{a detailed description of the}} aquifers with respect to localisation, extension, distribution and interconnection as well as their vulnerability to pollution (Thomsen et al. 2004). This mapping programme covers around 40 % of the area of Den-mark designated as particularly valuable water abstraction areas. <b>Water</b> con-sumers <b>fi</b> nance the mapping pro-gramme by paying 0. 04 € per cubic metre of consumed water. At the end of the programme in 2015, the total cost is estimated to be about 250 000 000 € with a significant part spent on geo-physical mapping. The mapping programme is admin-istered by seven local offices under the Ministry of Environment, but most of the practical work is carried out by pri-vate consulting companies, and involves the use of geophysical survey methods, survey drillings, well logging, water sampling and hydrological mapping, as well as geological and groundwater modelling. In major parts of the particularly valuable water abstraction areas, it is important to obtain spatially dense geophysical data covering large con-tinuous areas. Geophysical methods used in the hydro-geological mapping The choice of geophysical methods depends on the geologi-cal setting of the aquifers. Those of interest for drinking water are primarily found within the upper 250 m of the subsur-face. The aquifers can be grouped into three main types. I...|$|R

40|$|Bryodiversity is {{naturally}} serving the ecosystems sustainably. It serves the environments by preventing natural disaster (fl ooding), maintaining {{the quality of}} the <b>water</b> body and <b>fi</b> lter or treats the pollutants naturally. Effi cient bryodiversity management is needed for environmental cost cutting and have a cost-eff ective management strategy. To achieve this, cluster and principal component analyses (PCA) were manipulated to produce the linkage distance between the OTUs and identify the important groups of characters, respectively. In return, it becomes a guideline for bryofl ora and environmental managements. In this study, 23 OTUs and 156 characters were analyzed. h e output from the reliability and item analysis showed that the data set is highly reliable (Cronbach’s alpha = 0. 9627). From the cluster analysis, it showed that 5 clustered groups (manageable units) could be derived from the produced phenogram. h is is based on the nearest neighbour amalgation rule and Euclidean distances. As for the principal component analysis, three factors were derived and explained 75. 1064 % of the variation with 56. 0485 %(PC 1), 11. 7346 %(PC 2) and 7. 3233 %(PC 3), respectively. h e ordination showed that 5 manageable units were derived from PC 1 and 3 manageable units for PC 2 and PC 3, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{proposes to}} use a {{suitable}} liquid desiccant to extract fresh water from the humid atmosphere. The night-time moisture absorption and the day-time moisture desorption {{take place in the}} same unit. It consists of a flat, blackened, tilted surface and is covered with a single glazing. During the night, the strong absorbent flows down as a thin film over the glass cover in contact with the humid ambient air. Due to absorption of moisture from the ambient air at night, the absorbent becomes diluted. In order to recover the fresh water from the weak absorbent, it flows down as a thin film over the absorber during the day and is heated by solar energy. The <b>water</b> that evaporates <b>fi</b> om the absorbent rises to the glass cover by convection where it is condensed {{on the underside of the}} glass cover. The absorbent leaving the unit becomes strong and ready for moisture absorption at night. The performance of the unit was computed analytically for typical summer climatic data for the month of August in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, by solving the energy balance equations. It is shown that for the given operating conditions it is possible to obtain about 1. 92 kg of water per m(2) of the unit. The influence of absorbent concentration and its flow rat...|$|R
