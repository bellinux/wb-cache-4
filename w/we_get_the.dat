5|$|Swans {{were kept}} by the Bishops of Lichfield on Bishops Fish Pool from the early 14th century. Special pens and nesting areas were constructed. Ownership of the birds passed to the Lichfield Corporation from 1548. In 1704 the lease owner of 'Swan Moggs' was {{required}} to allow the swans make their nests there. In this area today <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> street names Swan Road and Swan Mews reflecting {{the history of the}} land use.|$|E
5|$|Then if V'i = V {{for each}} i, the {{resulting}} direct sum {{can be written}} in exponential notation as V⊕N, or simply VN {{with the understanding that}} the direct sum is the default. We can again replace the set N with a cardinal number n to get V'n, although without choosing a specific standard set with cardinality n, this is defined only up to isomorphism. Taking V to be the field R of real numbers (thought of as a vector space over itself) and n to be some natural number, <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> vector space that is most commonly studied in linear algebra, the real vector space Rn.|$|E
5000|$|The {{term was}} {{previously}} used in 1998 by YBA Jake Chapman of the Chapman Brothers (2003 Turner Prize nominees): [...] "We thought if <b>we</b> couldn't <b>get</b> <b>the</b> Turner Prize <b>we</b> should <b>get</b> <b>the</b> Turnip Prize." ...|$|R
30|$|Thus, <b>we</b> can <b>get</b> <b>the</b> {{estimates}} of (0, H) which {{are similar to}} (ϱ,v) in the system (19) 1 –(19) 2. Moreover, <b>we</b> will <b>get</b> <b>the</b> better decay rate of the magnetic field by the elliptic system.|$|R

25|$|Now {{if we take}} a nontrivial {{ultrafilter}} (which is {{an extension}} of the Fréchet filter) and do our construction, <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> hyperreal numbers as a result.|$|E
25|$|By equating the topological and {{analytical}} indices <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem. In fact {{we get a}} generalization of it to all complex manifolds: Hirzebruch's proof only worked for projective complex manifolds X.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally a new {{preposition}} is coined. Because a {{bare root}} may indicate a preposition or interjection, removing the grammatical suffix from {{another part of}} speech {{can be used to}} derive a preposition or interjection. For example, from fari (to do, to make) <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> preposition far (done by).|$|E
30|$|Then, <b>we</b> can <b>get</b> <b>the</b> desired estimate.|$|R
30|$|Then, <b>we</b> can <b>get</b> <b>the</b> theorem easily.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, <b>we</b> can <b>get</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} corollary.|$|R
25|$|According to Judges 12:6, {{the tribe}} of Ephraim could not {{differentiate}} between Shin and Samekh; when the Gileadites were {{at war with}} the Ephraimites, they would ask suspected Ephraimites to say the word shibolet; an Ephraimite would say sibolet and thus be exposed. From this episode <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> English word shibboleth.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the name Frensham come from 'Frena's ham'. Frena {{was the name of}} either a Danish Earl who was killed in the battle of Ashdown in the year 871, or of a Saxon who was driven south from Northumberland by the Danes in 993. The second part 'ham' means 'settlement', and is also from where <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> word 'home', so Frensham is 'Frena's settlement'.|$|E
25|$|The second great {{influence}} on Bracton's thinking was William Raleigh, {{also known as}} William de Raley, a native of Devon. He was a resident in and around Bratton Fleming in 1212, when Bracton was born there. Raleigh was a justice of the bench in 1228. In 1234 he pronounced reversal judgment of Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent's outlawry. Though {{he was not a}} justicier, he was regarded as the chief among judges. In 1237 he was appointed treasurer of Exeter Cathedral. He was elected to the See of Winchester in 1238 and passed from legal history. His election to this position was violently opposed by the King who favoured William of Valence. In 1239 Raleigh was elected to the See of Norwich. In 1244 {{he was elected to the}} See of Winchester for a second time. He died in 1250. He had much to do with the passage of the Statute of Merton. Raleigh defended the refusal of the barons to change the law of bastardy and legitimation. He invented the writ Quare ejecit infra terminum and was influential in the writing of several other novel writs. It is from Bracton that <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> majority of the history of the law at this time. Bracton is thought to have had a notebook with 2000 cases from Pateshull and Raleigh.|$|E

On one side <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> use of alligators as stepping stones and the pompous pitbull of rootin' tootin' Sheriff Pepper {{caught up in the}} thrilling boat chase. On the other, the genuine aura of threat through weird voodoo henchman Tee Hee and the leaning toward - what's this? - realism in Mr Big's plot to take over the drug trade from the Mafia."

500|$|The album {{received}} a Grammy Award nomination for Best Orchestral Performance at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards, marking the third for Kalmar and the orchestra. In addition, Alspaugh {{was nominated for}} Producer of the Year, Classical. Kalmer said of the recognition, [...] "I {{think this is a}} confirmation of the excellent quality that the orchestra is offering. In my mind, it's very important that we get nominated. Whether <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> Grammy or not has so many other components." [...] Christine Whiteside, executive director of the Oregon Symphony Association in Salem, said, [...] "It validates the quality of the Oregon Symphony, and what a great honor it is to have a Grammy-nominated orchestra play in Salem." ...|$|E
500|$|UGO Networks writer Jon Lachonis stated, [...] "If {{you were}} on the fence before, [...] will drag you kicking and {{screaming}} into the dark world of Fringe science wielding bogeymen. [...] "In Which we Meet Mr. Jones" [...] is what Fringe promised it would be from the beginning, a suspense driven procedural that probes deep into our technological phobias. With this new formulation of Fringe, <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> challenge of a sophisticated crime drama mixed with sad sack characters that tempt the everyman into the game, while blowing us away with a level of wordplay and pseudo science that CSI or Alias could only have dreamed of." [...] The A.V. Club's Noel Murray enjoyed the episode, giving it a B+, while Television Without Pity gave the episode a B-.|$|E

500|$|... "As {{we enter}} the dog days of summer, <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> summer movie season dregs as well," [...] wrote PopMatters editor Bill Gibron, anticipating August 2013. The year's other dump period {{straddles}} summer and fall, and does not lend itself to being as clearly delineated as the winter dump months. In the past it was usually considered to include all of August and September, and in some years still may. But in years with many major summer movies, some may open on {{the first or second}} weekend of August to avoid competing with other such movies, such as Guardians of the Galaxy, the first-ever August release by Marvel Studios, which took in $94 million on the first weekend of that month in 2014. It was the most successful August opening weekend, and it became one of the year's top-grossing films.|$|E
500|$|Heidemann and Walde {{produced}} a prospectus for internal discussion, outlining what {{was available for}} purchase and the costs. The document, signed by Heidemann, finished with a veiled threat: [...] "If our company thinks that the risk is too great, I suggest that I should seek out a publishing company in the United States which could put up the money and ensure that <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> German publication rights." [...] The pair did not show the prospectus to anyone at Stern, but instead presented it to Gruner + Jahr's deputy managing director, Dr Jan Hensmann, and Manfred Fischer; they also requested a 200,000mark deposit from the publisher to secure the rights with Kujau. After a meeting that lasted {{a little over two}} hours, and with no recourse to an expert or historian, the deposit was authorised. As soon as the meeting ended, at about 7pm, Heidemann travelled to Stuttgart, with the deposit money, to meet Kujau.|$|E
500|$|In early 2009, {{the band}} {{returned}} to the studio with Martin and Ulrich Wild to record their seventh album, Picket Fence Cartel. Time was spent leisurely crafting the album; previous endeavors had been limited by deadlines. [...] "This time around, we said, 'Look, let's not just put out another record,'" [...] said Schwab, [...] "'Let's make sure <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> record {{to a place that}} we're happy with it.'" [...] The band focused on a heavy metal sound. However, they did not entirely jettison their 1980s influences as synthesizers percolated several songs. Schwab's lyrics focused on his belief that power and corruption often [...] "run hand-in-hand when it comes to human souls." [...] "The world is teaching us that fame is to be sought after; that recognition will equal success, fortune and, ultimately, peace," [...] he said, [...] "But the search for and attainment of fame and wealth usually destroy us in the end." ...|$|E
