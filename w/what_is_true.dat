5|$|Termites are detritivores, {{consuming}} dead {{plants at}} any level of decomposition. They also {{play a vital role}} in the ecosystem by recycling waste material such as dead wood, faeces and plants. Many species eat cellulose, having a specialised midgut that breaks down the fibre. Termites are considered to be a major source (11%) of atmospheric methane, one of the prime greenhouse gases, produced from the breakdown of cellulose. Termites rely primarily upon symbiotic protozoa (metamonads) and other microbes such as flagellate protists in their guts to digest the cellulose for them, allowing them to absorb the end products for their own use. Gut protozoa, such as Trichonympha, in turn, rely on symbiotic bacteria embedded on their surfaces to produce some of the necessary digestive enzymes. Most higher termites, especially in the family Termitidae, can produce their own cellulase enzymes, but they rely primarily upon the bacteria. The flagellates have been lost in Termitidae. Scientists' understanding of the relationship between the termite digestive tract and the microbial endosymbionts is still rudimentary; <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> in all termite species, however, is that the workers feed the other members of the colony with substances derived from the digestion of plant material, either from the mouth or anus. Judging from closely related bacterial species, it is strongly presumed that the termites' and cockroach's gut microbiota derives from their dictyopteran ancestors.|$|E
25|$|What seems true is more {{important}} than <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> – Perception of reality is far more influential than the actual objective reality. A person can know that a computer is a box made of wires and processors but can still assign a personality to it. The important point to remember is that these responses are just part of being human and participating in a communication event.|$|E
25|$|It is {{sufficient}} to prove the theorem when the conic is a circle, because any (non-degenerate) conic {{can be reduced to}} a circle by a projective transformation. This was realised by Pascal, whose first lemma states the theorem for a circle. His second lemma states that <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> in one plane remains true upon projection to another plane. Degenerate conics follow by continuity (the theorem is true for non-degenerate conics, and thus holds in the limit of degenerate conic).|$|E

25|$|The {{belief that}} {{scientific}} theories should and do represent metaphysical reality {{is known as}} realism. It can be contrasted with anti-realism, {{the view that the}} success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as electrons. One form of anti-realism is idealism, the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality. In an idealistic world view, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for one mind need not be true for other minds.|$|E
25|$|The {{paradox of}} thrift (or paradox of saving) is a paradox of economics. The paradox states that an {{increase}} in autonomous saving leads to a decrease in aggregate demand and thus a decrease in gross output which will in turn lower total saving. The paradox is, narrowly speaking, that total saving may fall because of individuals' attempts to increase their saving, and, broadly speaking, that increase in saving may be harmful to an economy. Both the narrow and broad claims are paradoxical within the assumption underlying the fallacy of composition, namely that <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> of the parts must be true of the whole. The narrow claim transparently contradicts this assumption, and the broad one does so by implication, because while individual thrift is generally averred {{to be good for}} the economy, the paradox of thrift holds that collective thrift may be bad for the economy.|$|E
25|$|The depopulation, {{defended by}} Claudio Sanchez-Albornoz, is doubted today, at least {{concerning}} its magnitude. Two main arguments {{are used to}} refute it. First, the minor toponymy was preserved in multiple districts. Second, there are biological and cultural differences between {{the inhabitants of the}} Cantabrian zone and those of the central Plateau. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> is that {{in the first half of}} the eighth century there was a process of rural growth that led to the abandonment of urban life and the organization of the population in small communities of shepherds. Several causes explain this process: The definitive breakdown of the production system based on slavery in existence from the time of the late Roman Empire, the continuous propagation of epidemics in the area, and the abandonment of al-Andalus by the Berber regiments after the revolt of 740-741. All this made possible the emergence of a sparsely populated and ill-organized area that isolated the Asturian kingdom from the Moorish assaults and allowed its progressive strengthening.|$|E

500|$|In {{obscuring}} reality, truth becomes unclear. As {{literary critic}} Mireille Rosello notes, {{it is the}} President who decides <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> denying any other opinion, even if other characters witness an event with their own eyes or ears. Unlike {{the characters in the}} novel, readers are aware that the characters are relying on a notion of truth or reality that no longer exists under the dictatorship of the President. [...] "Truth" [...] does not exist before the President puts it into words, and even at that, the only [...] "truth" [...] under dictatorial rule is the words the President is speaking at any given momentone cannot even safely repeat the President's versions of events. The characters are thus left unaware of what constitutes the [...] "truth".|$|E
500|$|Anekantavada is the {{principle}} of relativity of truth or the doctrine of multiple aspects. Jains hold that truth is multifaceted and has multiple sides that cannot be completely comprehended by anyone. Anekantavada describes {{the world as a}} multifaceted, ever-changing reality with an infinity of viewpoints relative to the time, place, nature and state of one who is the viewer and that which is viewed. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> from one point of view is open to question from another. Absolute truth cannot be grasped from any particular viewpoint alone, because absolute truth is the sum total of all different viewpoints that make up the universe. Because it is rooted in these doctrines, Jainism cannot exclusively uphold the views of any individual, community, nation, or species. [...] It recognises inherently that other views are valid for other peoples, and for other life-forms. [...] This perception leads to the doctrine of syadvada or sevenfold predication stating the truth from different viewpoints. Anekantvada is the doctrine and Syadvada is its expression. [...] According to Jaina philosophers all important philosophical statements should be expressed in this sevenfold way in order to remove the danger of dogmatism (ekanta) in philosophy.|$|E
500|$|Some Christians {{integrate}} {{yoga and}} other aspects of Eastern spirituality with prayer and meditation. This has been attributed to a desire to experience God in a more complete way. In 2013, Monsignor Raffaello Martinelli, servicing Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, having worked for over 23 years with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI), said that for his Meditation, a Christian can learn from other religious traditions (zen, yoga, controlled respiration, Mantra), quoting Aspects of Christian meditation: [...] "Just as [...] "the Catholic Church rejects nothing of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> and holy in these religions," [...] neither should these ways be rejected out of hand simply because they are not Christian. On the contrary, one can take from them what is useful so long as the Christian conception of prayer, its logic and requirements are never obscured. It is within the context of all of this that these bits and pieces should be taken up and expressed anew." [...] Previously, the Roman Catholic Church, and some other Christian organizations have expressed concerns and disapproval with respect to some eastern and New Age practices that include yoga and meditation.|$|E

[...] In these misuses of freedom of choice lies the deprivation that accounts for error. [...] And this deprivation, I maintain, lies in the working of the will insofar as it comes from me — not in my God-given ability to will, or even in the will's operation insofar as it derives from Him.

2500|$|Advaita Vedanta {{acknowledges}} and {{admits that}} from the empirical perspective there are numerous distinctions. It states that everything and each reality has multiple perspectives, both absolute and relative. All these are valid and true in their respective contexts, states Advaita, but only from their respective particular perspectives. This [...] "absolute and relative truths" [...] explanation, Advaitins call as the [...] "two truths" [...] doctrine. John Grimes, a professor of Indian Religions specializing on Vedanta, explains this Advaita doctrine with the example of light and darkness. From sun's perspective, it neither rises nor sets, there is no darkness, and [...] "all is light". From {{the perspective of a}} person on earth, sun does rise and set, there is both light and darkness, not [...] "all is light", there are relative shades of light and darkness. Both are valid realities and truths, given their perspectives. Yet, they are contradictory. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>true</b> from one point of view, states Grimes, is not from another. To Advaita Vedanta, this does not mean there are two truths and two realities, but it only means that the same one Reality and one Truth is explained or experienced from two different perspectives.|$|E
