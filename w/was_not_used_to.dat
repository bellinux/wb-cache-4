5|$|Greer Stadium's {{original}} scoreboard was a black, non-descript, rectangular {{unit with}} a two line reader panel. In 1985, it {{was moved to}} beside the left field foul pole {{to make room for}} a new rectangular 4-line scoreboard 10 feet (3m) high with a fully animated reader panel. The original unit was then used as an out-of-town scoreboard, displaying the scores of other baseball games. When the guitar display was installed in 1993, the original scoreboard was removed and replaced by the second scoreboard, which became the new out-of-town board. From 2008 to 2014, the out-of-town scoreboard <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> display scores; instead it was used only as a support for additional advertising signage.|$|E
5|$|In 1648, {{during the}} Second English Civil War, Charles moved to The Hague, where his sister Mary and his {{brother-in-law}} William II, Prince of Orange, seemed {{more likely to}} provide substantial aid to the royalist cause than his mother's French relations. However, the royalist fleet that came under Charles's control <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> any advantage, and did not reach Scotland in time to join up with the royalist Engager army of the Duke of Hamilton before it was defeated at the Battle of Preston by the Parliamentarians.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 1940, the 7th Infantry Division was {{reactivated}} at Camp Ord, California Under {{the command}} of Major General Joseph W. Stilwell. The Headquarters element, 13th and 14th Brigades did not reactivate, however, and the division was instead centered around three infantry regiments; the 17th Infantry Regiment, the 32nd Infantry Regiment, and the 53rd Infantry Regiment. The 13th Brigade was not activated {{for the duration of}} the war and its headquarters formation <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> form a new unit.|$|E

5|$|The opening {{movie to}} Ever 17 {{was created by}} the game's producer, who picked out CGs and {{keywords}} from the game to include. Nakazawa gave instructions to have the characters appear in the same order as the recommended route playing order the developers had decided on, hoping for the order to leave an impression and influence players to play the game in that order. The ending movie was created by Nakazawa, who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> the tools used in video creation. He added a timeline to the credits roll, intending for it to feel emotional to get an overview of the story after having finished it, and finding it fitting to have a timeline scrolling along with the calm ending theme. For the PlayStation Portable version, {{the creation of a new}} opening movie was outsourced to a video design company, chosen specifically for one designer working there. Nakazawa sent them instructions on what text and graphics to use, and they created an animatic based on it, before adding the details. The ending movie for this version {{was created by the}} publisher, Cyberfront, without Nakazawa's involvement.|$|E
5|$|Van Grunsven {{holds the}} record for winning the most Olympic medals by an equestrian, with nine medals, {{and is the only}} person to have won any equestrian event in three {{successive}} Olympics. She is also the only person to compete at seven successive Olympics in dressage. She has competed in every Olympic Games between 1988 and 2012, winning a total of three gold medals, five silvers and one bronze. At the 1988 Summer Olympics, riding Prisco, she was eliminated in the qualifying rounds of the individual dressage, and was the lowest-scoring member of the fifth-place Dutch team, meaning her score <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> determine the team's standing. At the 1992 Summer Olympics, her performance improved, and riding Bonfire she took fourth individually and won her first silver medal in the team competition. At the 1996 Games, again riding Bonfire, she won double silver in the individual and team dressage competitions.|$|E

25|$|K. B. Hedgewar, another Indian {{independence}} {{activist in}} Nagpur, who {{was concerned with}} the perceived weaknesses of the Hindu society against foreign domination, found Savarkar's Hindutva inspirational. He visited Savarkar in Ratnagiri in March 1925 and discussed with him methods for organising the Hindu nation. In September that year, he started Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS, National Volunteer Society) with this mission. However, the term Hindutva <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> describe {{the ideology of the}} new organisation; it was Hindu Rashtra (Hindu nation).|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Benton Area School District {{agreed to}} {{participate}} in a pilot program to develop a new way to evaluate teachers that, in part, takes into account student achievement. Two CSIU16 school districts are participating. The pilot program had 104 K–12 entities, including nine career and technical centers, nine charter schools and nine intermediate units. Beginning in January 2012, the participating schools will use the new evaluation method and provide feedback to the Department of Education. This new evaluation <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> determine an educator's official 2011–12 professional performance assessment.|$|E

25|$|The bearing {{receiver}} {{was otherwise}} {{identical to the}} range version, and fed into the CRT in the same fashion. A slower time base generator was used, triggered by the same signal as the first, but set to scan much more slowly. In this case the time base <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> measure range, and the horizontal location of the blip was not important. Instead, the time base was used simply to help ensure the bearing operator {{was looking at the}} same target as the range operator - the signal of interest would be somewhere close to centred.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Mahler co-created the {{critically}} acclaimed and award-winning indie game title, Ori and the Blind Forest, with Gennadiy Korol.

25|$|The world's first {{computer}} {{to play music}} was CSIRAC, which was designed and built by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard. Mathematician Geoff Hill programmed the CSIRAC to play popular musical melodies from the very early 1950s. In 1951 it publicly played the Colonel Bogey March, of which no known recordings exist. However, CSIRAC played standard repertoire and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> extend musical thinking or composition practice. CSIRAC was never recorded, but the music played was accurately reconstructed. The oldest known recordings of computer-generated music were played by the Ferranti Mark 1 computer, a commercial version of the Baby Machine from the University of Manchester {{in the autumn of}} 1951. The music program was written by Christopher Strachey.|$|E

25|$|At the 24 November 2014 council meeting, Painter {{moved to}} reconsider the agreement. The council {{unanimously}} rejected the land deal after Fruin recused himself from the vote. The council then discussed other potential uses for the money despite prior statements by senator Bill Brady that the money could be reallocated to other communities in his district if it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> expand McGraw Park. Renner stated that the grant {{could be used for}} any Bloomington parks or trails. According to Brady, the money was directed solely toward McGraw Park at the direction of former Bloomington mayor Steve Stockton. Stockton disputed this characterization, stating that he had discussed alternative uses for the money.|$|E
25|$|Before launch, {{testing of}} the {{assembled}} spacecraft uncovered a potential data corruption problem with an interface card {{that was designed to}} route MARDI image data as well as data from various other parts of the spacecraft. The potential problem could occur if the interface card were to receive a MARDI picture during a critical phase of the spacecraft's final descent, at which point data from the spacecraft's Inertial Measurement Unit could have been lost; this data was critical to controlling the descent and landing. This was judged to be an unacceptable risk, and it was decided to not use MARDI during the mission. As the flaw was discovered too late for repairs, the camera remained installed on Phoenix but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> take pictures, nor was its built-in microphone used.|$|E
25|$|In {{that stage}} thirteen, the {{temperature}} was extremely high. Two riders from the North African team, Marcel Molinès and Abdel-Kader Zaaf, broke away after 15 kilometers, and created a large gap, also because the other cyclists were more occupied with getting drinks. Some 20 kilometers from the finish, Zaaf started to zigzag across the road. A safety official pulled him from the race, afraid for his safety, and Molinès rode through alone. Zaaf {{did not agree with}} the safety official, and mounted his bicycle again. He quickly fell off his bicycle and fell asleep, and spectators moved him into the shade of a tree. When he woke up, he realized that he was in a race, got on his bicycle again and rode away, but going into the wrong direction. An ambulance was called, and Zaaf was taken away. Zaaf claimed that he had received wine from a spectator, and as a Muslim he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> the alcohol. Behind the two North-African cyclists, Kübler had attacked, and left his rivals Raphaël Géminiani and Louison Bobet minutes behind. Of the favourites, only Ockers managed to stay with Kübler.|$|E
