40|$|This paper {{describes}} how a machinelearning named entity recognizer (NER) on <b>upper</b> <b>case</b> text {{can be improved}} by using a mixed case NER and some unlabeled text. The mixed case NER {{can be used to}} tag some unlabeled mixed case text, which are then used as additional training material for <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>case</b> NER. We show that this approach reduces the performance gap between the mixed <b>case</b> NER and <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>case</b> NER substantially, by 39 % for MUC- 6 and 22 % for MUC- 7 named entity test data. Our method is thus useful in improving the accuracy of NERs on <b>upper</b> <b>case</b> text, such as transcribed text from automatic speech recognizers where case information is missing. ...|$|R

The device is installed on a tool table of an open-die forging press as easy as ordinary dies. Thereat, the lower case of the device is fixed to the tool table and always remains stationary while <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>case</b> {{is attached to the}} press ram and always travels along with it. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> press ram goes up <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> die also goes up and the side dies are retracted opening the device working space whereto a work piece is fed by a manipulator. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> press ram goes down the work piece is reduced simultaneously by four dies.
