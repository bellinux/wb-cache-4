5|$|Duckles {{observes that}} by 1651, the {{transition}} from the lute song to the continuo song was complete. Printed versions of songs can not be entirely trusted to represent what was sung, since, in order to keep engraving costs manageable, they would economize on written vocal embellishments. That's why manuscript sources are crucial to our understanding of transition to Baroque vocal styles. Duckles concludes by warning that those <b>who</b> <b>study</b> early 17th century lyric poetry must do so in conjunction with their intended musical settings, since words and music are inseparable.|$|E
5|$|Dyrwood is cursed by the Hollowborn Plague: {{children}} are being born without souls, leaving them totally unresponsive in a way similar to a permanent vegetative state. Many people blame animancers, the scientists <b>who</b> <b>study</b> and manipulate souls. Investigating the curse, the Watcher discovers that the Hollowborns' souls have in fact been stolen by a cult known as the Leaden Key, led by a priest named Thaos, and that Thaos is framing animancers for the Plague. This eventually leads to a riot {{in the capital city}} where animancers are lynched and their college is destroyed.|$|E
40|$|First-year {{university}} students (n = 185) completed an online questionnaire that allowed comparison of those <b>who</b> reported <b>studying</b> on-campus with those <b>who</b> reported <b>studying</b> fully-online. Independent sample t-tests compared {{the means of}} students in the two study modes on demographics, frequency of use of digital technology and metacognitive learning characteristics. Compared to students <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> on-campus, students <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> fully-online were older, more likely to be native English speakers and had lower expectations of academic achievement. Compared to students <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> fully-online, students <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> on-campus were more likely to use a computer to chat or tweet, had higher levels of extrinsic achievement motivation and expressed greater need for peer and teacher support for learning. Some differences between on-campus and fully-online students appear to be eroding; other differences persist. Implications for instructional practice are presented...|$|R

5|$|Experiments {{confirming}} {{the role of}} kin selection in worker policing demonstrate the effects of multiple matings, {{which can lead to}} lower average relatedness between workers. Queens of the social wasp Dolichovespula saxonica mate singly or multiply. Researchers <b>who</b> <b>study</b> these wasps have observed a strong positive correlation between worker relatedness and male production. After controlling for the absolute number of eggs laid, these scientists conclude that the queen's multiple matings favor mutual worker policing.|$|E
5|$|LTP has {{received}} much attention among those <b>who</b> <b>study</b> Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease that causes marked cognitive decline and dementia.

Because of the hippocampus' well established role in LTP, {{some have suggested that}} the cognitive decline seen in individuals with AD may result from impaired LTP.|$|E

40|$|Using 2006 Canadian Census data, {{this paper}} {{focuses on the}} {{economic}} performance of highly educated immigrants who were born in less developed countries and <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> inside or outside Canada. There are two outcomes that are studied for immigrants and Canadian-born: access to a full-time full-year job and earnings. This study finds that immigrants from all places of birth have a lower probability of having a full-time full-year job than Canadian-born individuals and that, for most places of birth; immigrants <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> outside Canada have a lower probability of having such a job than immigrants <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> in Canada. People with more years of schooling earn more for both immigrants and Canadian-born, but immigrants earn less than the Canadian-born workers with the same educational attainment. Among the immigrants, some completed their higher education {{in their own country}} while others studied in Canada. The results show that immigrants <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> in Canada tend to earn more than immigrants <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> outside Canada...|$|R

5|$|There {{have not}} been any {{controlled}} studies on meth mouth, and several of its aspects are unclear.

There are few ties between dental scholars and those <b>who</b> <b>study</b> drug use, and it can be difficult for dental researchers to find methamphetamine users to study.|$|E
5|$|The Appaloosa is an American horse breed {{best known}} for its {{colorful}} spotted coat pattern. There is a wide range of body types within the breed, stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history. Each horse's color pattern is genetically the result of various spotting patterns overlaid on top of one of several recognized base coat colors. The color pattern of the Appaloosa is of interest to those <b>who</b> <b>study</b> equine coat color genetics, as it and several other physical characteristics are linked to the leopard complex mutation (LP). Appaloosas are prone to develop equine recurrent uveitis and congenital stationary night blindness; the latter has been linked to the leopard complex.|$|E
5|$|Ethnologists and anthropologists <b>who</b> <b>study</b> myths have {{developed}} various classification schemes {{for the various}} themes that appear in creation stories. For example, in one type of story, the world is born from a world egg; such stories include the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, the Chinese story of Pangu or the Indian Brahmanda Purana. In related stories, the Universe is created by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the Tibetan Buddhism concept of Adi-Buddha, the ancient Greek story of Gaia (Mother Earth), the Aztec goddess Coatlicue myth, the ancient Egyptian god Atum story, and the Judeo-Christian Genesis creation narrative in which the Abrahamic God created the Universe. In another type of story, the Universe is created from the union {{of male and female}} deities, as in the Maori story of Rangi and Papa. In other stories, the Universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god— as from Tiamat in the Babylonian epic Enuma Elish or from the giant Ymir in Norse mythology– or from chaotic materials, as in Izanagi and Izanami in Japanese mythology. In other stories, the Universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as Brahman and Prakrti, the creation myth of the Serers, or the yin and yang of the Tao.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine the differences of independence in doing academic activities between the students <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> in school that using KTSP 2006 and Kurikulum 2013. The hypothesis that conducted is there are differences in the level of independence in doing academic activities between the students <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> in school that using KTSP 2006 and Kurikulum 2013. Where the students <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> in school that using Kurikulum 2013 is more independent in term of doing academic activities rather than students <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> in school that using KTSP 2006. The population in this research is high school students in Yogyakarta. The samples in this research are the students from SMAN 6 Yogyakarta as students <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> using Kurikulum 2013 and the students from SMAN 5 Yogyakarta as students <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> using KTSP 2006. The number of samples taken is 40 students of SMAN 6 Yogyakarta and 40 students of SMAN 5 Yogyakarta. The samples selection is using Purposive Sampling method. The tool that used in data collection is using independence scale in doing academic activities. The analysis method that used to find the differences is different test non-parametrik Mann Whitney U method. According to the analysis, the result is the value of Mann Whitney U is 734 with Sig 0. 524 (p 0. 05). The result shows that there are no differences between the students <b>who</b> <b>studied</b> using KTSP 2006 and Kurikulum 2013 in term of independences in doing academic activities.
