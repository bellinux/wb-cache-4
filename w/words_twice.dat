6000|$|So, for a while, {{there came}} a pause in that battle, and in that pause Sir Lamorack {{perceived}} where Sir Godwin stood {{in the midst of}} the castle folk, urging them to the attack. Thereat of a sudden the madness of battle fell upon Sir Lamorack, so that he waited not for another assault, but, shouting aloud, he ran at his enemy, whirling his sword about his head. At that fierce attack the castle folk scattered from before him like to chaff before the wind, and so Sir Lamorack and Sir Godwin stood face to face with no one to stay Sir Lamorack in his assault. Then Sir Lamorack whirled his sword and smote such a buffet that though Sir Godwin took that buffet upon his shield, yet his wits melted away from him because of the blow he had received. Then his defences fell low before him, his head hung upon his breast, he staggered, and his thighs trembled with weakness. Then he cried out, [...] "Mercy! Mercy!" [...] saying those <b>words</b> <b>twice</b> over. But Sir Lamorack would not hear him, but lifting up his sword he smote Sir Godwin again, and with that second stroke Sir Godwin fell down upon his knees to the ground. Then Sir Lamorack rushed off the helmet of Sir Godwin and he catched Sir Godwin's head by the hair and drew his neck forward. And he whirled up his sword and he smote Sir Godwin's head from his body so that it rolled down upon the stones of the courtyard.|$|E

50|$|The Christians {{needed to}} elect a {{successor}} to Yahballaha. Maʿna, metropolitan of Fars, knew Persian and Syriac. He had studied at Edessa and had translated several books from Syrian into Persian. Yazdgird knew him, {{as he had been}} introduced to him with Yahballaha. The Christians asked Mirshabur, the head of the militia, to persuade Yazdgird to appoint Maʿna, and they offered him a sum of money to achieve this aim. Mirshabur helped them. He asked for an audience with the king and told him, 'Maʿna is a Persian, and capable of serving you. Let him be elected catholicus.' The Christians, happy with this result, hoped to see the restoration of the churches {{and the end of the}} persecution. But their hope, as the prophet Isaiah says, was soon dashed. One day, when Maʿna presented himself before Yazdgird, accompanied by several fathers, the king fixed them with glaring eyes. They realised that he was still seeking a pretext for persecuting them, which he found in the conduct of the priest Hosea which we described earlier. Then the king said, 'Caesar is the absolute ruler of his kingdom, and can do there whatever he pleases. I am also the master of my realm, and will do here as I choose.’ The king repeated these <b>words</b> <b>twice.</b> A priest of Seleucia named Narsai then replied on behalf of the catholicus, and said to the king, 'Sire, Caesar may insist that taxes and dues should be paid within his realm, and he can also kill his enemies, but he has no power to force his subjects to abandon their religion. There are a large number of Jews, pagans and heretics in his empire, but he does not force them to change their beliefs.' The king was angered by these words, and his counsellors exclaimed that Narsaï deserved to be put to death for speaking to the king in such a tone. The catholicus then said, 'Narsaï has merely answered the king’s question, and has done nothing to deserve death.' But Yazdgird ordered the priest to be beheaded if he did not deny Christianity, and also ordered that the catholicus should be stripped of his robes of office and exiled to Fars, and should no longer be called catholicus either in public or in private. Hosea of Nisibis and Bata of Lashom tried to speak up for him, but the king forbade them to speak and had them removed. The magi worked diligently to try to reconvert the priest Narsaï to their religion. But he remained unshakeable in his faith, and was beheaded. The faithful buried him in the great church of Seleucia.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a corpus-based intercultural {{communication}} study comparing the syntactic form and pragmatic use of tags by non-native speakers (Hong Kong Chinese) and native speakers of English. It outlines the main findings and seeks to explain where, when, and why tags are used by {{the two groups of}} speakers in their conversations. The study shows that when compared with their native speaker interlocutors, the non-native speakers use tag questions much less frequently, but use tag <b>words</b> <b>twice</b> as often. The two groups of speakers also use tags differently to express pragmatic meaning. The non-native speakers display a preference for using invariant tag forms and use tags mostly for seeking confirmation from the hearer. The tags used by native speakers of English are more evenly spread across a number of pragmatic functions: asking for information, seeking confirmation and emphasizing what is being said. Tentative explanations are offered to account for the findings presented. Department of Englis...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that studying audio and visual stimuli in two different rooms increases verbal recall, as compared to studying twice in only one room (Smith, Glenberg, 2 ̆ 6 Bjork, 1978). The present study utilized this paradigm, and also separated the room and modality factors as sources of environmental enrichment. In Experiment 1, subjects learned a list of 40 common English <b>words</b> <b>twice,</b> in either one or two different rooms, and were tested in a third room (N = 60). In Experiment 2, subjects learned the same word lists, using either one or two modalities (audition and vision), and again were tested in a third environment (N = 59). As predicted from the theory of Smith and Vela (2001), the usual improvement in memory from either room or modality enrichment did not occur when short time intervals were used between learning and recall, and the mean recall scores were essentially identical. The enrichment effect is interpreted as involving the development of categorized memory information over time, thus enabling retrieval strategies to operate, rather than {{an increase in the}} strength of initial learning...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine how adults evaluate the narrative story-telling ability of children. Causal models were constructed to track the effect of language disfluency on source, message, and task evaluation. In Study 1 (N= 68), adult viewers were shown a video of a fourth grade male student with borderline language disorder who exhibited an above average amount of normal disfluency. The experimental task required the child to retell an age appropriate story. The boy retold the story in his own <b>words</b> <b>twice.</b> Adult viewers were assigned to either the disfluent message (the first retelling) or fluent message (the second retelling) conditions. Language disfluency decreased adult involvement with the task and perceived child motivation, but increased perceived child dynamism and adult comprehension of the child 2 ̆ 7 s message. The only effects of language disfluency ratings of the child 2 ̆ 7 s ability were indirect. In Study 2 (N= 415), adult viewers were shown one of eight videos consisting of either a male or female fourth grader listening to an audio recording of an age appropriate story and then that child retelling the same story. The children in Study 2 were selected so as to vary the range of expressive and receptive disorders as well as gender. Expressive disorders decreased adult involvement with the task, perceived child motivation, and perceived child ability. Receptive disorders decreased adult involvement with the task, perceived child ability, and perceived child dynamism; receptive disorders increased perceived child motivation and adult comprehension of the child 2 ̆ 7 s message. The results from Study 1 and Study 2 provide {{strong support for the}} general information processing model proposed and for the specific model applied to adult evaluations of children. ...|$|E
40|$|Understanding jokes {{is part of}} {{the process}} of native lan-guage acquisition, and jokes are part of the charm that belongs to any language. Learning to {{understand}} jokes in a new language is both a cause, and a consequence, of language proficiency (Cook 2000). The most obvious benefit of under-standing jokes is that it can help stu-dents feel more comfortable in their new language. A shared moment of humor lowers the affective filter, that invisible barrier that makes learners feel awkward and uncomfortable. A low affective filter is one of the cornerstones of successfully learning a new language (Krashen 1982). If a class can laugh together, they are likely to learn better together, too. Jokes based on word-play have additional benefits because they build metalinguistic awareness, or conscious awareness of the forms of lan-guage, and this, in turn, helps in learn-ing more language (Ely and McCabe 1994; Zipke 2008; Lems 2011). In particular, metalinguistic awareness boosts reading comprehension and encourages higher-order thinking. Even native speakers need to access a great deal of linguistic information and background knowledge to “get” a joke (Aarons 2012). At the same time, jokes that are based on word-play in another language can be really hard to understand because they need to be processed very quickly. In a social setting where everyone is stand-ing around chatting, understanding a joke that comes up may seem like a high-stakes test. Not understand-ing a joke in this situation can make someone feel like an outsider and cre-ate a sense of isolation. For all these reasons, an important part of learning a new language is learning to enjoy its jokes. Puns: A special form of joke Puns are a special form of humor based on double meanings. Puns are sometimes nicknamed “the lowest form of humor ” and often greeted with groans, but in fact, the language knowledge needed to understand a pun is very sophisticated (Pollack 2011). Because they require processing the sound and meaning of <b>words</b> <b>twice,</b> puns demand considerable languag...|$|E

Responses to tasks requiring responses in different modalities (one oral and one written) often resulted in lexically “inconsistent” responses. For example, to a picture representing pliers, WMA said “pincers,” but wrote saw; and, to a picture representing peppers, he wrote tomato but said “artichoke. ” By contrast, inconsistent responses never occurred in tasks that required two consecutive responses in the same modality (oral or written).
