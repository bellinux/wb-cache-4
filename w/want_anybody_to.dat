25|$|Krishnamurti {{was also}} {{concerned}} about his legacy, about being unwittingly turned into some personage whose teachings had been handed down to special individuals, rather than the world at large. He did not <b>want</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> pose as an interpreter of the teaching. He warned his associates on several occasions {{that they were not}} to present themselves as spokesmen on his behalf, or as his successors after his death.|$|E
25|$|During Savile's lifetime, {{sporadic}} {{allegations of}} child abuse were made against him dating back to 1963, but only became widely publicised after his death. Savile claimed {{the key to his}} success on Jim'll Fix It had been that he disliked children, although he later admitted to saying this to deflect scrutiny of his personal life. He did not own a computer as he did not <b>want</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> think he was downloading child pornography. His autobiography As it Happens (1974, reprinted as Love is an Uphill Thing, 1976) contains admissions of improper sexual conduct which appear to have passed unnoticed during his lifetime.|$|E

I guess {{a part of}} me wanted to be truthful about what it is that really drives me, and maybe give back to the place that is nourishing me... I don't know what to say. When I read books or see films or listen to albums I want certain things. I want a heart—I'm very old school like that, I'm very emotional... I just didn't <b>want</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> know. I wanted it for myself. The lyric to 'Cocoon' was a whole diary, then I had to edit 90 per cent of it out. It's very hard to explain, but when I read it and the other person it's about reads it, we don't feel abused or anything. I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. I have a problem with music that's too indulgent. It's like 'Keep your own dirty laundry, please'".|$|E
500|$|In January 2010, Sevigny won a Golden Globe {{award for}} Best Supporting Actress– Series, Miniseries or Television Film for her {{performance}} in the third season of Big Love. The series itself also received nominations in two other categories. During a press conference following the award win, Sevigny addressed the repressed women living in the fundamentalist Mormon compounds: [...] "These women are kept extremely repressed. They should be helped. They don't even know who {{the president of the}} United States is." [...] In addition, she had various screening credits that year: Sevigny landed major roles in two independent comedy films: Barry Munday and Mr. Nice in Munday, Sevigny plays the sister of a homely woman who is expecting a child by a recently castrated womanizer (opposite Patrick Wilson and Judy Greer); in Mr. Nice, she had a leading role as British marijuana-trafficker Howard Marks' wife, alongside Rhys Ifans; the film was based on Marks' autobiography of the same name. In a later interview with The A.V. Club, Sevigny was asked if she felt that the show's message was that polygamy was [...] "wrong". In response, Sevigny stated: [...] "No, absolutely not. I think there are more parallels to gay rights and alternative lifestyles within Big Love—more so than 'Polygamy is wrong'. I think they actually condone people who decide to live this lifestyle outside of fundamentalist sects." [...] During the same interview, Sevigny stated her disappointment with the series' fourth season, calling it [...] "awful" [...] and [...] "very telenovela"—though she stated that she loves her character and the writing, she felt the show [...] "got away from itself". Sevigny later regretted making the statements, saying she was very [...] "exhausted" [...] and [...] "wasn't thinking about what [...] was saying"; she also apologized to the show's producers. [...] " [...] that I was biting the hand that feeds me, because I obviously love the show and have always been nothing but positive about it. And I didn't <b>want</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> misunderstand me or think that I wasn't, you know, appreciative." ...|$|E

[...] Even {{in the face of}} these multiple shocks, and a perfect opportunity to dodge the war, Herrera was unswayed. [...] As he later related, [...] "I thought, I'm going anyway. [...] I didn't <b>want</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> die in my place... I felt that I had my adopted country that had been so nice to me. [...] I thought, I have an American wife and the kids and one on the way." [...] It was only the first of several life-changing acts of heroism Herrera would take.|$|E
500|$|A {{third quarter}} diving Troy Polamalu interception, on Kevin Kolb's first NFL pass, {{was named a}} [...] "Can't Miss Play" [...] by NFL Network. The Steelers did not capitalize, punting two more times in the third quarter. The Eagles entered the final quarter leading 10–6, and added two more points when Roethlisberger was called for Intentional {{grounding}} while in the end zone. Roethlisberger {{was forced to leave}} the game after his hand was stepped on in the final quarter. Offensive coordinator Bruce Arians took responsibility for the offense's performance. [...] "Anybody who <b>wants</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> blame for Philadelphia, you just blame me," [...] Arians stated, [...] "and then we can get ready for Baltimore." ...|$|R

2500|$|Beginning on 20 April, al-Khawaja refused all fluids, {{including}} {{water and}} intravenous saline. He {{asked to see}} his lawyer to write a will, but was denied access for the fourth week. So he begged his wife to pass on three things: that he was completely convinced as to the rightness of his action and, could he go back, would choose the same path again; his appeal that no one attempt a similar strike to the death; and finally, [...] "If I die, in the next 24 hrs, I ask the people to continue {{on the path of}} peaceful resistance... I don't <b>want</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> be hurt in my name." [...] On 25 April (his 77th day of hunger strike), his wife learned he had disappeared from his hospital bed. Both the Ministry of Interior and the Bahrain Defense Force hospital refused information as to his whereabouts or treatment. On 29 April, it emerged that he had been drugged, tied to a bed, and forcibly fed with a nasoenteric tube. Al-Khawaja considered the force feeding and the solitary confinement to be torture; he gave the doctor's name as Dr Ebrahim Zuwayed, declared he will hold him, the hospital and the Ministry of Interior responsible, and that he was continuing with his hunger strike.|$|E

5000|$|Adapting to life outside, however, {{proved to}} be a challenge. Phyllis Valentine says she felt people knew that she'd been in a Magdalene laundry, even though in truth, they knew nothing about her. Valentine later married and had children, but she was uncomfortable with the sexual aspect of the marriage, since the nuns had never {{prepared}} her for the outside world. As a result, she and her husband gradually drifted apart. Martha Cooney never married, because, in her own words, [...] "I never <b>wanted</b> <b>anybody</b> <b>to</b> have power over me, or chain me ever again". Christina Mulcahy also married and had children, but did not tell her family about her illegitimate son until she was diagnosed with a terminal illness.
