Moreover, <b>we</b> <b>argued</b> that it might in particular be jobs involving complex tasks and jobs that are characterized by autonomy tasks that cannot be easily replaced by computers or other means of technology.|$|R

"Social" of ELSI seems to be the concept that differs from lexical "social" in a nuance a little somehow or other.
