5|$|The {{main event}} at Destination X was a Six Man Tag Team match pitting The Unlikely Alliance of Christian Cage, Kevin Nash, and Samoa Joe against The Angle Alliance (Kurt Angle, A.J. Styles, and Tomko). The storyline behind this match was Joe's quest {{to win the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship from Angle, with the two {{scheduled}} {{to fight for the}} title at TNA's next PPV event Lockdown on April 13, 2008. Also connected was Cage's feud with Styles and Tomko, after the two betrayed him and cost him the TNA World Heavyweight Championship twice against Angle in the storyline at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January 6, 2008, and at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008. This bout was announced on the February 21, 2008, episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact! during a backstage segment between Joe and Management Director Jim Cornette. On the March 6, 2008, episode of Impact!, the participants in the match fought in a series of matches to determine <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a five-minute man advantaged at Destination X.

The consequences of the disease left polio victims marked for life, leaving behind vivid images of wheelchairs, crutches, leg braces, breathing devices, and deformed limbs. However, polio changed not only the lives of those who survived it, but also affected profound cultural changes: the emergence of grassroots fund-raising campaigns that would revolutionize medical philanthropy, the rise of rehabilitation therapy and, through campaigns for the social and civil rights of the disabled, polio survivors helped to spur the modern disability rights movement.|$|E
25|$|A player's ranking {{points for}} an event {{must be at least}} 1.2. Players <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> less than this using the above formula get no ranking points. For example, if an event has a ranking of 10 only the leading 12 players (and ties) receive any ranking points since the player in 12th place gets 12% of the event ranking (i.e. 1.2). The player in 13th {{position}} gets no points. Where there is a tie for the final scoring place, those players are guaranteed to receive at least 1.2 points. Using the above example, if there were two or more players tied for 12th place, each would receive 1.2 points. The only exceptions to this system are in the major championships where all players who make the cut get a minimum of 1.5 ranking points.|$|E

During the contest, A.J. Styles interfered and Joe fought Styles to the back, but Tomko came out and attacked Cage giving Angle the win. On the February 14 edition of Impact!, Joe formed an alliance with Cage and Kevin Nash, to compete with Kurt Angle's Angle Alliance. It was also announced that Joe would be given the next TNA World Heavyweight Championship opportunity against Angle. Over the next few weeks, Joe and his newfound alliance would attack the Angle Alliance leading up to their match at Destination X. Joe vowed that he would eliminate the Angle Alliance so he would receive a fair title match with Angle at Lockdown. On the March 6 edition of Impact!, Joe, Christian, and Nash faced {{a member of the}} Angle Alliance to determine <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a five-minute advantage during their match at Destination X. Joe lost his First Blood match to Tomko, but Nash defeated Styles in a Street Fight while Cage defeated Angle in a Six Sides of Steel match. Joe's team won the match when he made Tomko submit to the Coquina Clutch. Achieving his goal to eliminate the Angle Alliance, nothing now stood in the way of Joe getting a fair title shot at Lockdown.|$|E
25|$|The school {{itself has}} had a long and tumultuous history. The several {{attempts}} to establish a secondary school in town failed before the founding of the high school. Among the failed schools were: Barnstable Academy 1837; Hyannis High School, 1837; and the Hyannis Seminary, 1849. These schools were mostly run with private funds. There was the feeling though that these schools were insufficient and there was a consensus that a town funded high school should be established. In 1871, it was voted that a high school would be established in West Barnstable and Centerville. In 1872, it was voted that another one be established in Hyannis. A struggle ensued among the three villages on <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> the school. Centerville soon dropped out and this led to a compromise being reached between the two villages. It turned out that Hyannis started classes in 1873, maintaining the school until 1876. Barnstable then oversaw the school from 1876–1879. In 1879, the school moved permanently back to Hyannis. As a result of these moves in location, the first graduating class occurred in 1883. This was caused because when the school would move, the students from which the school was originally located would drop out and the students in the new location would join the school. The first class originally included two people, Miss Phoebee Crowell and Miss Nellie Coleman. Class sizes grew slowly from there. In 1890, the class size was four. The 1895, eleven; 1900, fourteen; 1905, fifteen; 1920, twenty-two. From 1920 on, the classes grew steadily until the first class of over 100, the class of 1949 was graduated.|$|E

[...] However, Sabres coach/general manager Punch Imlach asked Campbell to check again. As it turned out, the pointer was on 11. [...] Imlach had chosen 11 for the roulette wheel spin because it was his favourite number. This was the first year the Montreal Canadiens did not have a priority right to draft Québécois junior players. Consequently, Perreault was available and taken first overall by the Sabres.|$|E
500|$|Schamus {{was still}} {{rewriting}} the script in October 2001.

France criticized Schamus and Hayter for claiming they were aiming to make Banner a deeper character, and was saddened they had denigrated his and Turman's work in interviews. Schamus elected to get solo credit. France felt, [...] "James Schamus did {{a significant amount of}} work on the screenplay. For example, he brought in the Hulk dogs from the comics and he made the decision to use Banner's father as a real character in the present. But he used quite a lot of elements from John Turman's scripts and quite a lot from mine, and that's why we were credited." [...] France, Turman and Schamus received final credit. A theatrical release date for June 20, 2003 was announced in December 2001, with the film's title as The Hulk.|$|E
500|$|Within {{two months}} of the Bennettsville speech, Tillman was being talked of as a {{candidate}} for governor in 1886.

He principally promoted the establishment of a state college for the education of farmers, where young men could learn the latest techniques.

This controversy to some extent overshadowed Foraker's swearing-in as senator on March 4—Hanna adherents claimed that Bushnell had delayed the effective date of the industrialist's appointment until Foraker took his seat so that Hanna would be the junior senator. [...] In his memoirs, Foraker denied this, noting that Sherman was unwilling to resign until the afternoon of March 4, after the new president and Congress were sworn in and the new Cabinet, including Sherman, was confirmed by the Senate.

Prominent officers associated with the Đại Việt included Thieu and Khiêm. Khiêm blamed Khánh's weakness in dealing with Buddhist activists for the demonstrations in the cities and the rural losses to the communists. Thieu and another Catholic General Nguyễn Hữu Có called for the replacement of Khánh with Minh, but the latter refused.
