40|$|We have {{investigated}} overlapping <b>activation</b> <b>pathways</b> for <b>two</b> families of stress genes that {{are expressed in}} cells exposed to hypoxia. The growth arrest and DNA damage (gadd) genes are induced by DNA damage and irradiation, and their expression is associated with growth arrest. The glucose-regulated proteins (GKPs) are induced by chemical agents that disrupt protein trafficking in the endoplasmic reticulum such as tunicamycin and A 23187 and by hypoxia. Here, we demonstrate that the treatment of NIH- 3 T 3 cells with chemical inducers of GRPs results in increased levels otgadd 45 and gadd 153 mRN A as well as GRP 78 mRNA. In addition, hypoxia was also able to increase gadd 45, gaddl 53, and CRP 78 mRNA. Therefore the GRP and gadd genes can be activated by similar stimuli (e. g., hypoxia and chemical inducers). However, the mechanisms leading to increased levels of GRP 78 and gadd gene mRNA are different and may involve distinct protein kinases. Increased expre...|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the process leading to differentiation of PC 12 cells. This process is known to include extension of neurites {{and changes in the}} expression of subsets of proteins involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements or in neurosecretion. To this aim, we have studied a PC 12 clone (trk-PC 12) stably transfected with the nerve growth factor receptor TrkA. These cells are able to undergo both spontaneous and neurotrophin-induced morphological differentiation. However, both undifferentiated and nerve growth factor-differentiated trk-PC 12 cells appear to be completely defective in the expression of proteins of the secretory apparatus, including proteins of synaptic vesicles and large dense-core granules, neurotransmitter transporters, and neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzymes. These results indicate that neurite extension can occur independently of the presence of the neurosecretory machinery, including the proteins that constitute the fusion machine, suggesting the existence of differential <b>activation</b> <b>pathways</b> for the <b>two</b> processes during neuronal differentiation. These findings have been confirmed in independent clones obtained from PC 12 - 27, a previously characterized PC 12 variant clone globally incompetent for regulated secretion. In contrast, the integrity of the Rab cycle appears to be necessary for neurite extension, because antisense oligonucleotides against the neurospecific isoform of Rab-guanosine diphosphate-dissociation inhibitor significantly interfere with process formation...|$|R

Although epithelial cells are the primary site of productive HRV infection, previous studies have implicated macrophages in establishing the cytokine dysregulation that occurs during rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations. Analysis of the transcriptome of primary human macrophages exposed to major- and minor-group HRV demonstrated differential gene expression.

40|$|Charged {{residues}} in the S 4 {{transmembrane segment}} {{play a key}} role in determining the sensitivity of voltage-gated ion channels to changes in voltage across the cell membrane. However, cooperative interactions between subunits also affect the voltage dependence of channel opening, and these interactions can be altered by making substitutions at uncharged residues in the S 4 region. We have studied the activation of two mutant Shaker channels that have different S 4 amino acid sequences, ILT (V 369 I, I 372 L, and S 376 T) and Shaw S 4 (the S 4 of Drosophila Shaw substituted into Shaker), and yet have very similar ionic current properties. Both mutations affect cooperativity, making a cooperative transition in the <b>activation</b> <b>pathway</b> rate limiting and shifting it to very positive voltages, but analysis of gating and ionic current recordings reveals that the ILT and Shaw S 4 mutant channels have different <b>activation</b> <b>pathways.</b> Analysis of gating currents suggests that the dominant effect of the ILT mutation is to make the final cooperative transition to the open state of the channel rate limiting in an <b>activation</b> <b>pathway</b> that otherwise resembles that of Shaker. The charge movement associated with the final gating transition in ILT activation can be measured as an isolated component of charge movement in the voltage range of channel opening and accounts for 13 % (∼ 1. 8 e 0) of the total charge moved in the ILT <b>activation</b> <b>pathway.</b> The remainder of the ILT gating charge (87 %) moves at negative voltages, where channels do not open, and confirms the presence of Shaker-like conformational changes between closed states in the <b>activation</b> <b>pathway.</b> In contrast to ILT, the <b>activation</b> <b>pathway</b> of Shaw S 4 seems to involve a single cooperative charge-moving step between a closed and an open state. We cannot detect any voltage-dependent transitions between closed states for Shaw S 4.

We studied the contribution of the different complement <b>activation</b> <b>pathways</b> in the host defense against experimental polymicrobial peritonitis induced by cecal ligation and puncture by using mice deficient in either C 1 q or factors B and C 2.

In particular, we found that RA induces G 0 /G 1 cell cycle arrest in TKI resistant NSCLC cells and activates terminal differentiation programs by modulating the expression of GATA 6, a key transcription factor involved in the physiological differentiation of the distal lung. In addition, our results demonstrate that RA inhibits EGFR and Wnt signaling <b>activation,</b> <b>two</b> <b>pathways</b> involved in NSCLC progression. Furthermore, we uncovered a novel mechanism in NSCLC that shows how RA exerts its function; we found that RA-mediated GATA 6 activation is necessary for EGFR and Wnt inhibition, thus leading to 1) increased differentiation and 2) loss of proliferation.
