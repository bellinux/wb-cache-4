I didn't have anymore to do with those 12 steps other than that book had, those twelve steps, I believe came to Bill by himself, I think he told me they came to him in about 40 minutes and I think its one of the great instances of direct inspiration that I know in human history, inspiration which doesn't only bring material straight down outta heaven, but brings rather I think from God the ability to interpret human experience in such a way that you distill it down into transmissible principles, I compare it to Moses going up on a mountain and bringing down Ten tables of the Law, I don't think that's the first time Moses ever thought about righteousness, but I'm glad he went up there and got those ten and brought em down and gave em to us. And I'm glad Bill got quiet for those 40 minutes, until he finished off these 12 steps and I believe they have only been changed by about one word. Bill said at the end of this talk [...] "Who invented AA?, It was God almighty that invented AA, but this is the story of how <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> be Free." [...] And he closed by saying [...] "God grant that AA and the program of recovery, and unity, and service be a story that continues into the future as long as God needs it."

We bought or borrowed books, and read them together, <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> make Holland lace, studied Dutch cookery, and Annora, by Eustace's wish, took lessons on the lute and spinnet, her education in those matters having been untimely cut short.

60|$|I {{had noticed}} that {{whenever}} I built a fire, Ajor outlined in the air before her with a forefinger an isosceles triangle, and that she did {{the same in the}} morning when she first viewed the sun.

Always the short side of the triangle was uppermost. As she explained all this to me, she pointed to the decorations on her golden armlets, upon the knob of her dagger-hilt and upon the band which encircled her right leg above the knee--always was the design partly made up of isosceles triangles, and when she explained the significance of this particular geometric figure, I at once grasped its appropriateness.|$|E

60|$|DURING {{the dread}} {{reign of the}} Cholera in New York, I had {{accepted}} the invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight {{with him in the}} retirement of his cottage ornee {{on the banks of the}} Hudson. We had here around us all the ordinary means of summer amusement; and what with rambling in the woods, sketching, boating, fishing, bathing, music, and books, we should have passed the time pleasantly enough, but for the fearful intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city. Not a day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some acquaintance. Then as the fatality increased, <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> expect daily the loss of some friend. At length we trembled at the approach of every messenger. The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death. That palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I could neither speak, think, nor dream of any thing else. My host was of a less excitable temperament, and, although greatly depressed in spirits, exerted himself to sustain my own. His richly philosophical intellect was not at any time affected by unrealities. To the substances of terror he was sufficiently alive, but of its shadows he had no apprehension.|$|E

Ah! well do I remember the time--many years past now--when I had the whole Bible. It was such a happy time then--when good King Radama reigned, and the missionaries had schools and churches and meetings--when we prayed and sang to our heart's content, and the Bible was printed, by the wonderful machines brought by the white men, in our own language, and <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> read it. I was young then, and strong; but I don't think my heart was so warm as it is now! Learning to read was hard--hard; but the Lord made me able, and when I got a Bible all to myself I thought there was nothing more to wish for. But the good Radama died, and Ranavalona sits upon his throne. You know she has burned many Bibles. Mine was found and burned, but she did not suspect me. I suppose I am too poor and worthless for her to care about! Perhaps we did not think enough of the happy times when we had them! A brother gave me these two leaves. They are all that I have left now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet he indulged me {{in every}} vagary; for I {{was an only}} son, and of course a personage of {{importance}} in the household. I had two sisters older than myself, and one younger. The former were educated at New York, under {{the eye of a}} maiden aunt; the latter remained at home, and was my cherished playmate, the companion of my thoughts. We were two imaginative little beings, of quick susceptibility, and prone to see wonders and mysteries in everything around us. Scarce had <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> read, when our mother made us holiday presents of all the nursery literature of the day; which at that time consisted of little books covered with gilt paper, adorned with [...] "cuts," [...] and filled with tales of fairies, giants, and enchanters. What draughts of delightful fiction did we then inhale! My sister Sophy was of a soft and tender nature. She would weep over the woes of the Children in the Wood, or quake at the dark romance of Blue-Beard, and the terrible mysteries of the blue chamber. But I was all for enterprise and adventure. I burned to emulate the deeds of that heroic prince who delivered the white cat from her enchantment; or he of no less royal blood, and doughty enterprise, who broke the charmed slumber of the Beauty in the Wood! ...|$|E
