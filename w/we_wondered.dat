5|$|Right now, we are {{currently}} pursuing a long arch series for cable. <b>We</b> <b>wondered,</b> should we do a sequel to the first one or do we do a remake? We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, {{and once in a while}} you see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E
5|$|Gerber set out {{to expand}} the Society's {{membership}} beyond the original seven but had difficulty interesting anyone other than poorer gays in joining; he was also unable to gain any financial support from the more affluent members of Chicago's gay community. Gerber sought out the support {{of people in the}} medical professions and sex education advocates and was frustrated when he was unable to secure it, because of their fear of ruining their reputations through the association with homosexuality. Contemplating this failure in 1962, Gerber stated, The first difficulty was in rounding up enough members and contributors so the work could go forward. The average homosexual, I found, was ignorant concerning himself. Others were fearful. Still others were frantic or depraved. Some were blasé. Many homosexuals told me that their search for forbidden fruit was the real spice of life. With this argument, they rejected our aims. <b>We</b> <b>wondered</b> how we could accomplish anything with such resistance from our own people. Gerber shouldered all of the labor and financial obligations for the Society and for production of Friendship and Freedom, something he was willing to do in service of the cause, believing it possible he would be remembered as the gay Abraham Lincoln for his effort. The Society sought affiliation with the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology but the British Society declined, afraid of being linked with any organization that was specifically for homosexuals.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} seventh win {{of the season in}} front of 90,000 who attended the race. Johnson also earned $267,001 in race winnings. Afterward, he said, [...] "I guess {{it could have been a}} statement we were sending. There was a lot of pressure. All week long, <b>we</b> <b>wondered</b> if we could step up like we did today. I'm very proud how we rose to the occasion.", he continued, [...] "When I go home tonight, I'm going to be (mentally) driving laps, what I think I need to do in qualifying trim so I can put my best effort in on Friday. Same thing for race practice on Saturday, and go racing Sunday. Texas was such a good lesson. And I hope that the points we lost in Texas isn't what keeps us from winning this championship." ...|$|E

2500|$|We were slowly {{penetrating}} the great range {{within a few}} miles of the North Carolina border, passing cornfields so steep that <b>we</b> <b>wondered</b> how they could be cultivated, bouncing past old-time log cabins built of hand-hewn timber, and waving to unbelievably large numbers of silent children who watched amid the barking of their dogs ...|$|E
2500|$|The Black Iron Prison was {{an effort}} to create an updated, modern book that would {{function}} as Principia Discordia did when released. The collaborators stated that [...] "while the original Principia Discordia holds important messages and philosophies, <b>we</b> <b>wondered</b> if some of the humor and language might be dated and lost on a younger generation of Discordians. We wanted to crystalize some of our favorite themes from the Principia, those of radical free will and self-emancipation."

30|$|First of all, <b>we</b> <b>wonder</b> whether (and when) {{the use of}} CSI for LTE signal {{fingerprinting}} {{improves the}} performance {{with respect to the}} use of more classical approaches based on RSSI and RSRP. Moreover, <b>we</b> <b>wonder</b> whether using RSRP/CSI descriptors as fingerprint rather than direct CSI vectors is feasible and, in case, convenient. Results shown in this section are achieved using the signal received only from cell 255 (cell diversity is not considered) using 6 RBs (experiment 1), i.e., the LTE signal is observed over a small bandwidth of 1.4 MHz (narrowband scenario).|$|R
