25|$|The {{lack of any}} {{movement}} by General Junot to enact reforms and the violent behavior of the French soldiers finally compelled the Junta Provisional do Supremo Governo do Reino (Provisional Board of the Supreme Government of the Kingdom) to seek the aid of England, which sent an expeditionary force led by Wellesley and William Beresford. The French were outnumbered, and Junot was forced to retreat in late 1808 following a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>agreement</b> with the British, who simultaneously entered the town and set up their headquarters in Arroios. The British received control of Lisbon's and Portugal's governments from Prince Regent John, who now resided in Rio de Janeiro, and administered them as virtual colonies of Great Britain. Lisbon suffered economically {{with the opening of}} the ports of Brazil to England. Following the French withdrawal, the Portuguese populace was free to avenge itself on their francophile compatriots for the brutality and depredations of the French.|$|E
25|$|The treaty {{introduces}} an exit clause {{for members}} wanting {{to withdraw from}} the Union. This formalises the procedure by stating that a member state must inform the European Council before it can terminate its membership, and a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>agreement</b> would then be negotiated between the Union and that State, with the Treaties ceasing to be applicable to that State from the date of the agreement or, failing that, within two years of the notification unless the State and the Council both agree to extend this period. There have been several instances where a territory has ceased {{to be part of the}} Community, e.g. Greenland in 1985, though so far no member state has ever left. Before the Lisbon Treaty came into force, the question of whether a member state had a legal right to leave the union was unclear. Following the referendum of 23 June 2016, the British Prime Minister announced the government's intention of making the notification according to (Article 50) by the end of March 2017.|$|E

In addition, the Alberta government sets strict limits {{on how much}} water oil sands companies can remove from the Athabasca River. According to the Water Management Framework for the Lower Athabasca River, during periods of low river flow water consumption from the Athabasca River is limited to 1.3% of annual average flow.

He also proposed a ceiling of 275,000 personnel stationed in Europe by the US and Soviet Union. Bush's proposal was formally adopted during the 1989 Brussels NATO summit and subsequently presented in Vienna. In November the Berlin Wall fell and in the following months revolutions broke out in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria.

Municipalities in {{the state}} of Georgia with limited water {{resources}} may find Federal water projects to be a suitable source of water. This paper discusses the evolution of U. S.

5000|$|By 1 December 1945, in {{accordance}} with a directive dated 10 June 1945, the corps became the 9th Guards Tank Division. The division was stationed at Neustrelitz, and {{around the same time}} the 2nd Guards Tank Army became a mechanized army. In 1957, the army became a tank army again. On 11 January 1965, the division was renumbered as the 16th Guards Tank Division to [...] "preserve historical traditions" [...] and in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the end of World War II. In 1989, the 67th Guards Tank Regiment became the 723rd Guards Motor Rifle Regiment. The Soviet Union was dissolved in 1991, resulting in the withdrawal of remaining units from Germany. In 1992, the 723rd was relocated to Chaykovsky, Perm Krai {{and the rest of the}} division followed soon after. By 30 June 1993, the relocation was completed and the division was based in Markovsky, Perm Krai. Markovsky was purpose-built for the division to provide housing to its soldiers, and construction was paid for by the German government under the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>agreements.</b> In March 1995, the 723rd Regiment was sent to Chechnya to fight in the First Chechen War. At Grozny, the regiment was used to form the 205th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade. In March 1997, the division was reorganized into the 5967th Guards Weapons and Equipment Storage Base for armored troops. The former artillery regiment of the 90th Guards Tank Division became part of the storage base. In December 2009, the storage base was disbanded.|$|R

The ceasefire held until June 3, 1982 when the Abu Nidal Organization attempted to assassinate Shlomo Argov, Israels ambassador to London. Three days later, Israel reentered the PLO-controlled West Beirut and blockaded the city in order to contain insurgency. Seven weeks into the blockade, the besieged PLO acceded to a new <b>agreement</b> for their <b>withdrawal.</b> The <b>agreement</b> provided for the deployment of a Multinational Force to assist the Lebanese Armed Forces in evacuating the PLO, Syrian forces and other foreign combatants involved in Lebanons civil war.|$|R

The author's ambition was aimed at complex summarizing and describing these problems {{with respect to the}} available jurisdiction and results of the legal science. The dissertation presents the author's de lege lata and de lege ferenda considerations and also presents the author's views on the topical and controversial issues which are contentious {{from the point of view}} of practice. The legal regulation in effect is evaluated in comparison with the regulation that is to come in force on November 1, 2011 (Act No. 132 / 2011 Sb.), possibly which is being prepared only (draft Civil Code). Some part of the dissertation also compares the situation abroad. The legal regulation in effect is evaluated with respect to its use in current practice.

50|$|After {{six months}} of {{prolonged}} U.S.-mediated secret negotiations, representatives of the Lebanese, Israeli, and American governments signed a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>agreement</b> on 17 May 1983, which {{became known as the}} 'May 17 Agreement', that provided for the evacuation of all foreign armed forces from Lebanon. However, implementation of the <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>Agreement</b> depended entirely upon the cooperation of Syria who, incensed for being neither invited to the negotiations nor consulted prior to the signature of the agreement, rejected it by refusing to withdraw its 30,000 troops stationed in Lebanon. Many Lebanese, both Christian and Muslim, were not in favour of a U.S.-sponsored agreement either, which included severe security terms imposed by the Israelis and practically treated Lebanon as a defeated country. Although the agreement was approved by the Lebanese Parliament, President Amin Gemayel refused to ratify it, a decision that irritated the Israeli Prime-Minister Menahem Begin. Lebanese Sunni and Shia Muslims also felt both threatened and marginalized when their President, confident of U.S. political and military support, avoided implementing the much-needed political reforms to which the mainly Muslim Political Parties and militias felt entitled.|$|E
50|$|A February 2016 {{briefing}} {{note for}} the European Parliament stated that a {{withdrawal from the}} EU ends, from then on, {{the application of the}} EU Treaties in the withdrawing state, although any national acts previously adopted for implementing or transposing EU law would remain valid until amended or repealed, and a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>agreement</b> would need to deal with phasing-out EU financial programmes. The note mentions that a member withdrawing from the EU would need to enact its own new legislation in any field of exclusive EU competence, and that complete isolation of a withdrawing state would be impossible {{if there is to be}} a future relationship between the former member and the EU, but that a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>agreement</b> could have transitional provisions for rights deriving from EU citizenship and other rights deriving from EU law that the withdrawal would otherwise extinguish. The Common Fisheries Policy is one of the exclusive competences reserved for the European Union; others concern customs union, competition rules, monetary policy and concluding international agreements.|$|E
