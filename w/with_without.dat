At 10:30pm the rioters set fire to passenger cars, the dispatcher's office, and the roundhouse. Some firefighters dispatched to the scene were driven off, and others had their hoses cut when they attempted to set up their pumps, but, under the protection of the police and soldiers, the flames were extinguished. The Sun reported the fires damaged one passenger car and engine, destroyed the dispatcher's office, and damaged the roof of the depot's shed.

25|$|For a {{majority}} of black women feminism has failed to accurately and holistically describe them as individuals {{to the world that}} surrounds them. They feel as though it takes something new that is not already bound to a predetermined master in order to capture this new movement. Womanism is something that Alice Walker can completely identify <b>with</b> <b>without</b> having second thoughts; it feels natural to her. Feminism does not. When distinguishing between feminism and womanism {{it is important to remember}} that many women find womanism easier to identify with. In addition, a key component of a womanist discourse is the role that spirituality and ethics has on ending the interlocking oppression of race, gender, and class that circumscribes the lives of African-American women.|$|E
25|$|In November 1839 Cauchy {{was elected}} to the Bureau, and {{discovered}} immediately that the matter of the oath was not so easily dispensed <b>with.</b> <b>Without</b> his oath, the king refused to approve his election. For four years Cauchy was in the absurd position of being elected, but not being approved; hence, he was not a formal member of the Bureau, did not receive payment, could not participate in meetings, and could not submit papers. Still Cauchy refused to take any oaths; however, he did feel loyal enough to direct his research to celestial mechanics. In 1840, he presented a dozen papers on this topic to the Academy. He also described and illustrated the signed-digit representation of numbers, an innovation presented in England in 1727 by John Colson. The confounded membership of the Bureau lasted until the end of 1843, when Cauchy was finally replaced by Poinsot.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A common task in {{radiology}} {{interpretation is}} visual comparison of images. The {{purpose of this}} study was to compare traditional side-by-side and in-place (flicker) image presentation modes with advanced methods for detecting primary brain tumors on MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 66 patients with gliomas and 3 consecutive brain MR imaging examinations (a “triplet”). A display application that presented images in side-by-side mode <b>with</b> or <b>without</b> flicker display as well as display of image subtraction or automated change detection information (also <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> flicker display) was used by 3 board-certified neuroradiologists. They identified regions of brain tumor progression by using this display application. Each case was reviewed using all modes (side-by-side presentation <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> flicker, subtraction <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> flicker, and change detection <b>with</b> and <b>without</b> flicker), <b>with</b> results compared via a panel rating. RESULTS: Automated change detection <b>with</b> or <b>without</b> flicker (P. 0027) as well as subtraction <b>with</b> or <b>without</b> flicker (P. 0027) were more sensitive to tumor progression than side-by-side presentation in cases where all 3 raters agreed. Change detection afforded the highest interrater agreement, followed by subtraction.
