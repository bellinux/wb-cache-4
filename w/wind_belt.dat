5|$|The Antarctic Oscillation, {{also known}} as the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode is the main factor in tropospheric {{circulation}} variability south of 20oS and is characterized by pressure anomalies with one situated in the Antarctic and one situated in a band at around 40–50oS around the globe. It mainly affects middle and high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. It is characterized by the north–south displacement of the westerly <b>wind</b> <b>belt</b> that circle around Antarctica. Such variation in the position of the westerly <b>wind</b> <b>belt</b> affects the intensity and position of cold fronts and mid latitude storm systems and is partly responsible for variation in precipitation in the southern parts of Argentina. The Antarctic Oscillation is characterized by two phases: a positive and a negative phase. A positive phase is when the westerly <b>wind</b> <b>belt</b> is displaced to the south. The positive phase occurs when there is increased surface pressure over the southern parts of the South American continent and decreased pressure in Antarctica. This results in stronger westerly winds in the southern parts of the country while preventing cold fronts from penetrating inland, producing more stable conditions. Furthermore, the positive phase leads to warmer conditions south of 40oS, particularly during the summer in areas between 40–60oS. Precipitation is lower due to less frontal and orographic precipitation resulting from reduced westerly wind flow between 40–60OS. Opposite conditions occur in the negative phase when the westerly <b>wind</b> <b>belt</b> is shifted equatorward. Cold fronts moving northwards from the south penetrate more frequently, leading to more precipitation and cooler temperatures during the negative phase. The major effect of negative phase of the Antarctic Oscillation occurs in spring when it increases precipitation over southeastern South America.|$|E
50|$|The Antarctic {{oscillation}} (AAO, {{to distinguish}} it from the Arctic oscillation or AO) is a low-frequency mode of atmospheric variability of the southern hemisphere.

In its positive phase, the westerly <b>wind</b> <b>belt</b> contracts towards Antarctica, while its negative phase involves this belt moving towards the Equator.|$|E

40|$|We {{suggest the}} {{existence}} of zonal currents in the atmospheres of rapidly rotating stars analogous {{to those found in}} planetary atmospheres. The zonal flow is assumed to be characterized by 'thin' atmospheric, nearly geostrophic flow which does not change the gravity darkening and stellar shape determined by the underlying uniformly rotating model. The contribution that such flows make to the continuum spectra of such stars is investigated. The additional rotationally induced Doppler displacement resulting from such zonal <b>wind</b> <b>belts</b> can distort the rotationally broadened stellar lines leading to significant departures from the line profiles predicted by the classical model of rotating stars. Our estimates of the zonal flow velocity stem from the assumption of a relation between it and the latitudinal wavenumber of the zonal velocity field. It is thus possible to create barotropic atmosphere models which, in turn, enable the modeling of the stellar spectrum including important spectral lines. In addition, the radiative transfer equations for the Stokes parameters I and Q are solved for the locally plane-parallel atmospheres so that the polarization structure of the radiation field is determined. We find that the presence of zonal <b>wind</b> <b>belts</b> leads to significant changes in the photospheric polarization from those characteristic of a uniformly rotating model...|$|R
40|$|The {{position}} {{and intensity of}} the southern westerly <b>wind</b> <b>belt</b> varies seasonally {{as a consequence of}} changes in sea surface temperature. During the austral winter, the belt expands northward and the wind intensity in the core decreases. Conversely, during the summer, the belt contracts, and the intensity within the core is strengthened. Reconstructions of the westerly winds since the last glacial maximum, however, have suggested that changes at a single site reflected shifts throughout the entire southern <b>wind</b> <b>belt.</b> Here we use sedimentological and pollen records to reconstruct precipitation patterns over the past 12, 500 yr from sites along the windward side of the Andes. Precipitation at the sites, located in the present core and northern margin of the westerlies, is driven almost entirely by the <b>wind</b> <b>belt,</b> and can be used to reconstruct its intensity. Rather than varying coherently throughout the Holocene epoch, we find a distinct anti-phasing of wind strength between the core and northern margin over multi-millennial timescales. During the early Holocene, the core westerlies were strong whereas the northern margin westerlies were weak. We observe the opposite pattern in the late Holocene. As this variation resembles modern seasonal variability, we suggest that our observed changes in westerly wind strength can best be explained by variations in sea surface temperature in the eastern South Pacific Ocean...|$|E

Using direct numerical simulation and contour dynamics, we show that the interaction between two counter-propagating vorticity waves is solely responsible for this KH formation. We investigate the oscillation of the vorticity wave amplitude, the rotation and nutation of the elliptical vortex, and straining of the braids.

The presence of pollen-starved sediments with only scant evidence for semiarid vegetation indicates that extreme aridity ensued until similar to 5700 cal yr BP.

Here we present monthly resolved coral Sr∕Ca records from two different locations from Rodrigues Island (63 ° E, 19 ° S) in the south-central Indian Ocean trade <b>wind</b> <b>belt.</b> We reconstruct SST based on a linear relationship with the Sr∕Ca proxy with records starting from 1781 and 1945, respectively. We assess relationships between the observed long-term SST and climate fluctuations related to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole Mode (SIOD) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) between 1945 and 2006, respectively. The reproducibility of the Sr∕Ca records is assessed as are the potential impacts of diagenesis and corallite orientation on Sr∕Ca–SST reconstructions. We calibrate individual robust Sr∕Ca records with in situ SST and various gridded SST products. The results show that the SST record from Cabri provides the first Indian Ocean coral proxy time series that records the SST signature of the PDO in the south-central Indian Ocean since 1945.

40|$|We {{explore the}} impact of a {{latitudinal}} shift in the we- sterly <b>wind</b> <b>belt</b> over the Southern Ocean (SO) on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and on the carbon cycle for Last Glacial Maximum background conditions using a state-of-the-art ocean general circulation model. For this “westerly wind hypothesis” (Toggweiler et al. 2006) we find that a southward shift in the westerly winds leads to an intensification of the AMOC (northward shift to a weakening). This agrees with other studies (Sijp & England 2009) starting from pre-industrial background, but the responsible processes are different. During deglaciation a gradual shift in westerly winds might thus be responsible for a part of the AMOC enhancement, which is indicated by various studies. The net effects of the changes in ocean circulation lead to a rise in atmospheric pCO 2 of less than 10 μatm for both a northward and a southward shift in the winds. For northward shifted winds the zone of upwelling of carbon and nutrient rich waters in the Southern Ocean is expanded, leading to more CO 2 out-gassing to the atmosphere but also to an enhanced biological pump in the subpolar region. For southward shifted winds the upwelling region contracts around Antarctica leading to less nutrient export northwards and thus a weakening of the biological pump.

40|$|The {{change of}} sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) {{in the southern}} Indian Ocean (SIO) during the recent six decades has been analyzed based on oceanic reanalysis and model, as well as atmospheric data. The results show that a thermal regime shift in SIO during the 1960 s, which is not caught enough attentions, has been of equal magnitude to the linear warming since 1970. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analyses reveal that a thermal shift is combined with atmospheric changes such as the weakening of westerly {{during the period of}} 1960 - 1967. Inner dynamic connections can be defined that when the westerly winds turn weak, the anticyclonic wind circulation between westerly winds and the trade winds decreases, which further reduces the SST to a negative peak in this period. It is noted that the shifts in the 1960 s are also evident for Southern Hemisphere. For example, subtropical high and the entire westerly <b>winds</b> <b>belt</b> at high latitudes both change dramatically in the 1960 s.

Case studies using the WRF model and in situ aircraft observations indicate that the streaks originate from boundary layer rolls generated over the convective air above Swedish mainland, also supported by visual satellite images showing the typical signature cloud streets. The simulations indicate that the rolls are advected and maintained at least 30 – 80 [*]km off the coast, {{in agreement with the}} streaks observed by the SAR images. During evening when the convective conditions over land diminish, the streaky structures over the sea are still seen in the horizontal wind field; however, the vertical component is close to zero. Thus advected feature from a land surface can affect the wind field considerably for long times and over large areas in coastal regions.

40|$|We {{explore the}} impact of a {{latitudinal}} shift in the westerly <b>wind</b> <b>belt</b> over the Southern Ocean on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and on the carbon cycle for Last Glacial Maximum background conditions using a state-of-the-art ocean general circulation model. We find that a southward (northward) shift in the westerly winds leads to an intensification (weakening) of no more than 10 % of the AMOC. This response of the ocean physics to shifting winds agrees with other studies starting from preindustrial background climate, but the responsible processes are different. In our setup changes in AMOC seemed to be more pulled by upwelling in the south than pushed by downwelling in the north, opposite to what previous studies with different background climate are suggesting. The net effects of the changes in ocean circulation lead to a rise in atmospheric pCO 2 of less than 10 atm for both northward and southward shift in the winds. For northward shifted winds the zone of upwelling of carbon- and nutrient-rich waters in the Southern Ocean is expanded, leading to more CO 2 outgassing to the atmosphere but also to an enhanced biological pump in the subpolar region. For southward shifted winds the upwelling region contracts around Antarctica, leading to less nutrient export northward and thus a weakening of the biological pump.

40|$|A {{significant}} influence {{of changes in}} the westerly winds over the Southern Ocean was proposed as a mechanism to explain {{a large portion of the}} glacial atmospheric pCO 2 draw down (Toggweiler et al., 2006). However, additional modelling studies with Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity do not confirm the size and sometimes even the sign of the impact of southern hemispheric winds on the glacial pCO 2 as suggested by Toggweiler (Menviel et al., 2008; Tschumi et al., 2008, dOrgeville et al., 2010). We here add to this discussion and explore the potential contribution {{of changes in the}} latitudinal position of the winds on Southern Ocean physics and the carbon cycle by using a state-of-the-art ocean general circulation model (MITgcm) in a spatial resolution increasing in the Southern Ocean. We discuss how the change in carbon cycling is related to the upwelling strength and pattern in the Southern Ocean and how they depend on the changing wind fields and/or the sea ice coverage. While the previous studies explored the impact of the westerlies starting from present day or pre- industrial background conditions, we here perform simulations from Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, about 20, 000 year before present) background climate. Ocean surface conditions are taken from output of the COSMOS Earth System model for the LGM run (Zhang et al., submitted). Both a northwards and southwards shift of the westerly <b>wind</b> <b>belt</b> by 10 ° is investigated. Our results show, that the background climate has a {{significant influence}} on the simulations. A northwards shift of the Southern Ocean <b>wind</b> <b>belt</b> leads in both cases (LGM and present day) to a reduction of the Agulhas leakage and thus to a fresher Atlantic sea surface and consequently to reduced Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. A southwards shift in the <b>wind</b> <b>belt</b> leads during LGM background climate to an intensification of the ACC. Patterns how temperature and biogeochemistry (DIC) changes over depth are nearly opposite to those of d’Orgeville et al. (2010). Atmospheric CO 2 rises by 5 ppmv for both cases, the northwards or southwards wind shift. In conclusion, we propose that the investigation of changes in the westerly <b>wind</b> <b>belt</b> in the Southern Ocean for present day is not comparable with LGM and simulation studies without LGM background climate are of limited use.

The assemblages were also analyzed for the component loading of the relative abundances of different leaf morphotypes and the results were interpreted in light of stratigraphic and lateral ecological variation. Independent paleoclimate proxies from a variety of depositional environments consistently indicate warm-temperate to marginally subtropical mean annual temperatures (16. 5 – 20 °C) and high annual precipitation (1, 500 – 2, 500 mm) during the Burdigalian–Langhian of mid-latitude New Zealand.

50|$|The {{polar easterlies}} (also Polar Hadley cells) are the dry, cold {{prevailing}} winds that blow from the high-pressure {{areas of the}} polar highs at the North and South Poles towards low-pressure areas within the Westerlies at high latitudes. Cold air subsides at the poles creating the high pressure, forcing an equatorward outflow of air; that outflow is then deflected westward by the Coriolis effect. Unlike the westerlies in the middle latitudes, the polar easterlies are often weak and irregular. These prevailing winds blow from the polar easterlies {{are one of the}} five primary wind zones, known as <b>wind</b> <b>belts,</b> that make up our atmosphere's circulatory system. This particular <b>belt</b> of <b>wind</b> begins at approximately 60 degrees north and south latitude and reaches to the poles. When air moves near the poles, cold temperatures shrink the air. This promotes air from warmer latitudes to flow into the area, causing a polar high-pressure zone. Air from this high-pressure zone then rushes toward the low-pressure zone surrounding the sub-polar region. This flow of air is altered by the Earth's rotation and deflected west, hence the name between high- and low-pressure zones, its path is deflected—as we saw with the polar easterlies—thanks to the rotation of the Earth. All of this unequal heat, rushing air and spinning Earth combine to form global currents such as the polar easterlies.|$|R

Recently, deglacial and Holocene paleo-environmental related research has shifted its main focus from the North-Atlantic region to the Southern Hemispheric high latitudes, as Antarctica and the Southern Ocean have shown {{to play an important}} role in global climate regulation (e. g. Knorr & Lohman, 2003). Very recently, the tropical (mainly Pacific) latitudes have been evenly recognized as potentially playing a large role in global climate modulation, both at interannual- decadal (e. g. El Niño Southern Oscillation) and century to millennial time scales (e. g. long-term changes in ENSO variability; Shulmeister et al., 2006; Pena & Cacho, 2009). Pacific tropical and Antarctic climate anomalies are physically linked with each other through the strength and the position of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and Southern Westerly <b>Wind</b> <b>belt</b> (SWW). Therefore, recent climate reconstructions are focused on past changes in position and strength of these winds, which have a direct impact on local and/or regional weather patterns along the westcoast of South America, and the Antarctic Peninsula.

These investigations, spanning the last 19 kyr, reveal insights about prevalent climatic conditions on land (i. e., intensities of South American Monsoon System & Southern Westerly <b>Wind</b> <b>Belt,</b> or North-African Harmattan & trade winds) with impacts on major terrestrial sediment sources and transport paths. However, they also enable to draw conclusions about marine environmental conditions linked to ocean-current systems (i. e., Brazil & Malvinas Currents) ...|$|E
40|$|Topological entropy {{is shown}} to be a useful {{characteristic}} {{of the state of the}} free atmosphere. It can be determined as the stretching rate of a line segment of tracer particles in the atmosphere over a time span of about 10 days. Besides case studies, the seasonal distribution of the average topological entropy is determined in several geographical locations. The largest topological entropies appear in the mid- and high latitudes, especially in winter, owing to the greater temperature gradient between the pole and the equator and the more intense stirring and shearing effects of cyclones. The smallest values can be found in the trade <b>wind</b> <b>belt.</b> The local value of the topological entropy is a measure of the chaoticity of the state of the atmosphere and of how rapidly pollutants and contaminants spread from a given location...|$|E
50|$|The minaret is {{adjacent}} {{to the right side}} of the portico wall. It is entered through a door inside the portico. Built in ashlar, it sits on a square-plan base and has a polygonal-formed shaft. It has one balcony with muqarnas underpart. Under the balcony, a red-colored stone <b>belt</b> <b>winds</b> round. The minaret's spire has been restored.|$|R
60|$|Moran {{set about}} it, and, though time was precious, Jimmy {{did not try}} to hurry him, but stood listlessly looking out to sea. A fine rain was falling, there was very little <b>wind,</b> and <b>belts</b> of fog {{streaked}} the dim gray water between him and the horizon. He was watching one belt when it seemed to open and a blurred shape crept out. Jimmy dropped his pipe and scrambled to the cabin top. He could distinguish a patch of white hull and a tall mast. As he called to the others a short funnel appeared, and a trail of smoke lay dark {{along the edge of the}} fog.|$|R
40|$|The assemblages {{and general}} {{distribution}} of heavy minerals have been determined for the sand fraction of bottom surface sediments in the Narragansett Bay system and from Rhode Island Sound and its approaches. From these data distinct heavy mineral associations have been idetnified: an amphibole association with some staurolite, epidote, and clinozoislte-zolslte in upper Narragansett Bay; a rock fragment association i Mount Hope Bay and upper Sakonnet Passage; and an opaque mineral association with variable amounts of amphibole, garnet, and tourmaline {{on the inner}} shelf. Pre-Cambrian (?) greenstones and metamorphosed sedimentary ocks {{are believed to be}} the sources of the amphibole assemblage; Pennsylvanlan sedimentary rocks, the source of the rock fragment association; and coastal rocks of southern Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, the prin-cipal source of the opaque mineral suite. Present mineral composition of inner shelf sediments i primarily dependent on the nature of im-mediate source materials and not on the rigors of the reworking or redistribution processes. In the Narragansett Bay system, East Passage acts as the main dispersal route for the distribution of upper Bay amphibole sands as well as the rock fragment assemblage of Mount Hope Bay. On the inner shelf, bay sediments are deposited primarily along a <b>winding</b> <b>belt</b> near Point Judith Neck and also appear to be dispersed south of Narragansett Bay proper. From Buzzards Bay sediments are apparently carried seaward through the submarine valley whleh crosses the Sound. From these data it is inferred that as an inner shelf sedimentary environment, Rhode Island Sound represents an early stage in a newly developed epositional cycle under present marine con-ditions...|$|R
