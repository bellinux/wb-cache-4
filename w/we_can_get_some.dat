5000|$|The phrase [...] "and now <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sleep!'" [...] {{followed}} by laughter is {{used during the}} Wiggles Meet The Orchestra DVD when introducing the next song. A subtle parent joke.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> of the Harkness fellows to {{come over}} to us," [...] put in Spouter. [...] "I don't believe he's as popular as he thinks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{hungry and}} thirsty," [...] said the Prince, [...] "and perhaps <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> {{refreshments}} at yonder house. So far, {{this has not}} been a very fine hunt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sho, of course; I {{never thought}} of that. Well, come along, maybe <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sleep, but I don't know, I'm so shook up with what we've been through." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{commercial}} also generated another catch-phrase {{which became}} common in New Zealand and Australia. Before turning to camera {{at the start}} of the ad, our Claytons-drinking hero (played by Jack Thompson) tells the punch-line of a joke to the barman: [...] "... And then this guy says 'Now <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sleep!'" [...] After completing a particularly irksome task - perhaps changing a tyre in the rain, or dropping 12 children off to their respective houses after a noisy birthday party - one can say [...] "Now <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sleep" [...] to put a humorous full stop on the event.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you're so bull-headed about it. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> you <b>some</b> garter-snakes, {{and you can}} tie some {{buttons on}} their tails, and let on they're rattlesnakes, and I reckon that 'll have to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right," [...] Mr. Coulson answered. [...] "Let's {{go somewhere}} where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> supper. We'll {{go to the}} Abbaye Theleme, and you shall have the {{pleasure}} of entertaining me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can get brook trout," [...] {{answered}} Whopper. [...] "But {{just the}} same I'm willing to stay here to-day and fish. Maybe <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> big maskalonge, same as we did before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{perfectly}} certain," [...] said my uncle. [...] "There's {{not a moment}} to be lost. We must divide and search in different directions, unless <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> clue as to where they have gone." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Plenty of {{butterflies}} and morning-glories, uncle, and a girl's imagination will supply the romance. Perhaps <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> up <b>some</b> little surprise to add flavor to our day's adventures," [...] said Milly, who rather favored the plan, for much romance still lay hidden in that quiet heart of hers.|$|R
6000|$|... "On {{the other}} hand, here's gold {{knocking}} about like cast iron at home. If only <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> of it back, {{if only we}} can find our sphere again before they do, and get back, then--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then he said: [...] "The {{best place}} {{we can go}} to is to bed. If <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sleep in this wood, now {{everyone}} has cleared out of it, it will be worth a handicap of two hundred yards tomorrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Harris," [...] Chris said, [...] "there is a {{farmhouse}} over there, and as I see cattle and horses, it evidently is not deserted. Let us {{go and see}} if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> bread and some milk for the women." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We wouldn't let {{the boys}} come in. We'd have {{it a secret}} society, as they do their temperance lodge, and we'd have badges and pass-words and grips. It would be fun if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> only <b>get</b> <b>some</b> heathen to work at!" [...] cried Jill, ready for fresh {{enterprises}} of every sort.|$|R
30|$|In Theorem  1, {{we apply}} the fixed point theory {{to obtain the}} {{existence}} and uniqueness of the solution for a class of linear hybrid stochastic fourth-order parabolic equations. In fact, if we add some proper assumptions, then <b>we</b> <b>can</b> also <b>get</b> <b>some</b> good results for the nonlinear case. We leave this for the future work.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{of course}} your writing {{could not be}} trusted to a printer. Now {{what you should do}} is this: employ that Drane girl to copy your manuscript. She can do it here, and if she comes to a word she cannot make out, she can ask you. That will keep her going until autumn, and by that time <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> her <b>some</b> scholars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are starving, Koppelstok; can you {{inform us}} how <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> food? We {{have picked up}} two Spanish traders on our way here from Dover, but our larders were emptied before we sailed, and we found but scant supply on board our prizes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} had best strike out for the grove of trees on the right," [...] he announced. [...] "The {{distance}} is shorter than to the other shelters, and the grass is so high that perhaps <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> benefit by stooping down as we run." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said admiringly, [...] "you hain't {{one of them}} clutterin' females. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> finery for you in New York, Cynthy.

6000|$|... "I reckon {{it would}} be better if we 'tended to our {{business}} instead of whinin' about what can't be helped," [...] he said grimly, clutching yet more tightly the spokes of the wheel.

6000|$|... "Let us go {{back and}} get our rice and lota, Dick. We can't afford to lose that; and if we go at a trot for a couple of miles <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> round into <b>some</b> trees near the road, where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> see their faces. If the mounted {{officers}} are white it is all right; if not, they are mutineers." ...|$|R
500|$|Pacquette {{earned a}} call-up to the Dominica {{national}} {{team for the}} 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification CONCACAF First Round match against Barbados on 6 February 2008. Barbados went into the match as heavy favourites but fell behind to Pacquette's goal on his international debut, which finished as a 1–1 draw. After making his debut, manager Christopher Ericson said [...] "He is great in front of goal, powerful and full of effort and work. I only hope that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> him <b>some</b> more support up front in the next game – if we do I am sure <b>we</b> <b>can</b> win it". He also played in the 1–0 defeat in the second leg on 26 March.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Don't tempt me!' I says. 'I {{will not}} have any {{dealings}} with a woman not till we are a dam' side more settled than we are now. I've been doing the work o' two men, and you've been doing the work o' three.

5000|$|THX {{was about}} real {{things that were}} going on and the {{problems}} we're faced with. I realized after making THX that those problems are so real that most of us have to face those things every day, so we're {{in a constant state of}} frustration. That just makes us more depressed than we were before. So I made a film where, essentially, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> rid of <b>some</b> of those frustrations, the feeling that everything seems futile.|$|R
500|$|... "I {{jumped into}} bed {{with him and he}} climbed on top of me.

2500|$|Later Sarfraz {{insisted that}} Woolmer's {{death in a}} Kingston hotel on 18 March was linked to match fixing and {{extended}} his help to track the gang of bookies.

Perhaps <b>we</b> <b>can</b> even <b>get</b> <b>some</b> clues from the players", Sarfraz told The Sun, adding [...] "Woolmer's death is connected with the match-fixing mafia.". [...] "I believe the Pakistan World Cup games were fixed. There is a dark side to cricket. The game got on top of it for a while but it has never really been stamped out," [...] he said. Scotland Yard, later, declared that no foul play was involved in Woolmer's death, rejecting Sarfraz's allegations and vindicating the Pakistani team.|$|R
