After one argument Wellman retorted to the commander, [...] "You're just a goddamn fool because the government has told me {{you have to give}} me all your men and do just exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to do." [...] Although Wellman paid much attention to technical details in shooting, he used cars and clothing of the year during the filming, forgetting to use those of World War I. He took six weeks to fully edit the film and prepare it for release.|$|E

Songz said that Drake originally called him on advice of segueing his singing into rapping on interludes, then the terms of what records he would be featured on the mixtape, as he sent him the [...] "Successful" [...] track.

He explained to MTV News, [...] "The first thing that came to mind was 'I want the money, money and the cars/ Cars and the clothes/ The ho's/ I suppose I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful.' When I'm saying all that, conceptually for me, the deepest part of the record was when I say, 'I suppose.' I supposed that's what success is about. That's what [...] led to believe." [...] After hearing the hook, Drake called it [...] "powerful", commenting, [...] "And it's like, it's almost like it made me feel like it may not be right <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want,</b> <b>you</b> know?

The 'I suppose' moment in there is like, it's almost like you're doubting yourself for a second. But {{at the end of the}} day, I just want to be successful. So that's what the record meant to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{technique}} {{attributed to}} Sigmund Freud {{to help in}} making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: [...] "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> {{to do is to}} note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really feel about the matter, deep down inside. With that as a basis, you'll then be ready to make up your mind and come to the right decision." ...|$|E
