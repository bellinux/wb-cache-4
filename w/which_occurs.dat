5|$|Spontaneous pneumothoraces {{are divided}} into two types: primary, <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> {{in the absence of}} known lung disease, and secondary, <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> in someone with {{underlying}} lung disease. The cause of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is unknown, but established risk factors include male sex, smoking, and a family history of pneumothorax. Smoking either cannabis or tobacco increases the risk. The various suspected underlying mechanisms are discussed below.|$|E

5|$|As {{with most}} breeds of dog, the Russian Toy can suffer from patellar luxation, {{which is where}} the knee cap slips out of place when the knee bends as the groove that {{normally}} holds it in place is too shallow. It is usually an inherited defect, <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> during the development of the foetus and rarely by trauma.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} resemble females until puberty, <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> {{around four}} years of age, but have paler yellow barred underparts. As the birds reach maturity, males gradually replace their yellow tail feathers with red ones; the complete process takes around four years.|$|E
5|$|Newfoundland is {{also known}} for its fog <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> most often {{in the spring and}} early summer because of the {{contrast}} between sea and air temperatures. Argentia has 206 days of fog per year. Fog in Newfoundland is frequently accompanied by strong onshore winds; while usually winds disperse fog, here the fog is too widespread for this to occur.|$|E

5|$|Nightjars are {{medium-sized}} nocturnal {{birds that}} usually nest on the ground. They have long wings, short legs and very short bills.

5|$|Pseudomembranous colitis is a {{potentially}} lethal condition {{commonly associated with}} clindamycin, but <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> with other antibiotics, as well.

5|$|S.occidentalis {{may also}} be mistaken for Microstoma floccosum, <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> in the same habitat. M.floccosum, however, has taller cups and is covered with stiff white hairs.

5|$|The name Hale, <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> {{throughout}} Britain, {{derives from}} the Anglo-Saxon halh meaning a nook or shelter, as supported by the surrounding area which has natural features that would provide shelter. The 'Barns' element of Hale Barns comes from the Old Tithe Barn.|$|E
5|$|A pulse with {{different}} group and phase velocities (<b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> if the phase velocity {{is not the}} same for all the frequencies of the pulse) smears out over time, a process known as dispersion. Certain materials have an exceptionally low (or even zero) group velocity for light waves, a phenomenon called slow light, which has been confirmed in various experiments.|$|E

5|$|Acamprosate may {{stabilise}} {{the brain}} chemistry that is altered due to alcohol dependence via antagonising {{the actions of}} glutamate, a neurotransmitter which is hyperactive in the post-withdrawal phase. By reducing excessive NMDA activity <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> {{at the onset of}} alcohol withdrawal, acamprosate can reduce or prevent alcohol withdrawal related neurotoxicity. Acamprosate reduces the risk of relapse amongst alcohol dependent persons.|$|E
5|$|Accompanying {{injuries}} often play a {{key role}} in the outcome. Injuries that may accompany TBI include pulmonary contusion and laceration; and fractures of the sternum, ribs and clavicles. Spinal cord injury, facial trauma, traumatic aortic rupture, injuries to the abdomen, lung, and head are present in 40–100%. The most common accompanying injury is esophageal perforation or rupture (known as Boerhaave syndrome), <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> in as many as 43% of the penetrating injuries to the neck that cause tracheal injury.|$|E
5|$|Another {{chemical}} {{of interest}} found in P.indusiatus is hydroxymethylfurfural, which has attracted attention as a tyrosinase inhibitor. Tyrosinase catalyzes the initial steps of melanogenesis in mammals, and {{is responsible for}} the undesirable browning reactions in damaged fruits during post-harvest handling and processing, and its inhibitors are of interest to the medical, cosmetics, and food industries. Hydroxymethylfurfural, <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> naturally in several foods, is not associated with serious health risks. P.indusiatus also contains a unique ribonuclease (an enzyme that cuts RNA into smaller components) possessing several biochemical characteristics that differentiate it from other known mushroom ribonucleases.|$|E

5|$|At {{certain times}} in the {{geological}} past, corals were very abundant. Like modern corals, these ancestors built reefs, some of which ended as great structures in sedimentary rocks. Fossils of fellow reef-dwellers algae, sponges, {{and the remains of}} many echinoids, brachiopods, bivalves, gastropods, and trilobites appear along with coral fossils. This makes some corals useful index fossils. Coral fossils are not restricted to reef remnants, and many solitary fossils may be found elsewhere, such as Cyclocyathus, <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> in England's Gault clay formation.|$|E
5|$|Being a soft metal, mercury forms {{very stable}} {{derivatives}} with the heavier chalcogens. Preeminent is mercury(II) sulfide, HgS, <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> in nature as the ore cinnabar {{and is the}} brilliant pigment vermillion. Like ZnS, HgS crystallizes in two forms, the reddish cubic form and the black zinc blende form. Mercury(II) selenide (HgSe) and mercury(II) telluride (HgTe) are also known, these as well as various derivatives, e.g. mercury cadmium telluride and mercury zinc telluride being semiconductors useful as infrared detector materials.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Be and atomic number 4. It {{is a relatively}} rare element in the universe, usually occurring {{as a product of}} the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars beryllium is depleted as it is fused and creates larger elements. It is a divalent element <b>which</b> <b>occurs</b> naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals. Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald) and chrysoberyl. As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle alkaline earth metal.|$|E
