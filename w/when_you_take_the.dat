Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepiwall for HitFix {{wrote that}} the finale had [...] "funny throwaway lines and moments" [...] but that overall [...] "it was another largely flat episode, and one that leaned too heavily on the guest stars." [...] Callie Carmichael of CNN was less positive, writing that [...] "I Do Do" [...] fell [...] "a bit flat", and concluded [...] "As a rule of thumb, sitcoms usually fall short <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> characters out of their element, and this one definitely did with three weddings in three separate places." [...] Eleanor Barkhorn from The Atlantic had issues with the plot twists, citing {{that they would not}} [...] "bode well {{for the future of the}} series." [...] She explained that Jack and Avery having a child was [...] "problematic", observing that it puts a [...] "relatively definite end" [...] to the sexual tension between Liz and Jack that occurred in the show's first season. In addition, Barkhorn noted that Damon's character was a [...] "great match" [...] for Tina Fey's Liz, but believed that the relationship between the two would not last.|$|E

6000|$|In {{this way}} I have copied a fair number, and in glancing over my old note-books {{containing}} records of my rambles and observations, mostly natural history, I find these old epitaphs scattered through them. But I have never copied an inscription {{with the intention}} of using it. And this for the sufficient reason that epitaphs collected in a book do not interest me or anyone. They are in the wrong place in a book and cannot produce the same effect as when one finds and spells them out on a weathered stone or mural tablet out or inside a village church. It is the atmosphere--the place, the scene, the associations, which give it its only value and sometimes make it beautiful and precious. The stone itself, its ancient look, half-hidden in many cases by ivy, and clothed over in many-coloured moss and lichen and aerial algae, and the stonecutter's handiwork, his lettering, and the epitaphs he revelled in--all this is lost <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> inscription away and print it.

6000|$|The {{educational}} establishment of Mrs. Mix and Madame Bance, {{situated in the}} best quarter of Sacramento and patronized by the highest state officials {{and members of the}} clergy, was a pretty if not an imposing edifice. Although surrounded by a high white picket fence and entered through a heavily boarded gate, its balconies festooned with jasmine and roses, and its spotlessly draped windows as often graced with fresh, flower-like faces, were still plainly and provokingly visible above the ostentatious spikes of the pickets. Nevertheless, Mr. Jack Hamlin, who had six months before placed his niece, Miss Sophonisba Brown, under its protecting care, felt a degree of uneasiness, even bordering on timidity, which was new to that usually self-confident man. Remembering how his first appearance had fluttered this dovecote and awakened a severe suspicion {{in the minds of the}} two principals, he had discarded his usual fashionable attire and elegantly fitting garments for a rough, homespun suit, supposed to represent a homely agriculturist, but which had the effect of transforming him into an adorable Strephon, infinitely more dangerous in his rustic shepherd-like simplicity. He had also shaved off his silken mustache for the same prudential reasons, but had only succeeded in uncovering the delicate lines of his handsome mouth, and so absurdly reducing his apparent years that his avuncular pretensions seemed more preposterous than ever; and when he had rung the bell and was admitted by a severe Irish waiting-maid, his momentary hesitation and half humorous diffidence had such an unexpected effect upon her, that it seemed doubtful if he would be allowed to pass beyond the vestibule. [...] "Shure, miss," [...] she said in a whisper to an under teacher, [...] "there's wan at the dhure who calls himself, 'Mister' Hamlin, but av it is not a young lady maskeradin' in her brother's clothes Oim very much mistaken; and av it's a boy, one of the pupil's brothers, shure ye might put a dhress on him <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> others out for a walk, and he'd pass for the beauty of the whole school." ...|$|E

6000|$|These utterances of Friedrich's, {{the more}} we examine them by other lights that there are, become the more {{correctly}} expressive of what Friedrich's real feelings were on the occasion. Much contrary, perhaps, to expectation of some readers. And indeed we will here advise our readers to prepare for dismissing altogether that notion of Friedrich's duplicity, mendacity, finesse and the like, which was once widely current in the world; and to attend always strictly to what Friedrich says, {{if they wish to}} guess what he is thinking;--there being no such thing as [...] "mendacity" [...] discoverable in Friedrich, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> trouble to inform yourself. [...] "Mendacity," [...] my friends? How busy have the Owls been with Friedrich's memory, in different countries of the world;--perhaps even more than their sad wont is in such cases! For indeed he was apt to be of swift abrupt procedure, disregardful of Owleries; and gave scope for misunderstanding {{in the course of his}} life. But a veracious man he was, at all points; not even conscious of his veracity; but had it in the blood of him; and never looked upon [...] "mendacity" [...] but from a very great height indeed. He does not, except where suitable, at least he never should, express his whole meaning; but you will never find him expressing what is not his meaning. Reticence, not dissimulation. And as to [...] "finesse,"--do not believe in that either, in the vulgar or bad sense. Truly you will find his finesse is a very fine thing; and that it consists, not in deceiving other people, but in being right himself; in well discerning, for his own behoof, what the facts before him are; and in steering, which he does steadily, in a most vigilant, nimble, decisive and intrepid manner, by monition of the same. No salvation but in the facts. Facts are a kind of divine thing to Friedrich; much more so than to common men: this is essentially what Religion I have found in Friedrich. And, let me assure you, it is an invaluable element in any man's Religion, and highly indispensable, though so often dispensed with! Readers, especially in our time English readers, who would gain the least knowledge about Friedrich, in the extinct Bedlam where his work now lay, have a great many things to forget, and sad strata of Owl-droppings, ancient and recent, to sweep away!-- ...|$|E
