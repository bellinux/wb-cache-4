Its above ground symptoms indicates that the trees are mostly beyond treatment and recovery, as rapid progress of infection makes death imminent. This disease caused significant mortality to tree irrespective of age or health status, causing economic losses to the latex industry in many Countries. It is the most destructive root disease in Rubber plantations in Sri - Lanka and many other rubber growing countries. <b>White</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> has now become the most threatening root disease of the rubber tree in both Asian and African Continents which supply 98% of the natural rubber to the world market.

In vitro studies of the effects of these compounds on different R. necatrix strains isolated from avocado roots and with different virulence demonstrated that 6 PP had the strongest effect even at a low concentration. Although unstable, Cerinolactone and T 39 butenolide also had large effects on R. necatrix, mainly at a concentration of 200 Î¼g. Harzianolide and Dehydroharzianolide exhibited the lowest effects on the pathogen. In vivo studies of Trichoderma metabolites on Lupinus luteus plants demonstrated the delay of <b>white</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> epidemic through preventive application of 6 PP or Harzianolide to seeds or plantlets by immersion in solutions of these metabolites at 1 mg l- 1 (minimum effective dosage).

Phenylalanine ammonia lyase from Hevea brasiliensis (HbPAL) presented a complete open reading frame (ORF) of 2, 145 bp with 721 encoded amino acids. The sequence alignment indicated that the amino acid sequence of HbPAL shared a high identity with PAL genes found in other plants. Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that HbPAL was more closely related to PALs in Manihot esculenta and Jatropha curcas than to those from other plants. Transcription pattern analysis indicated that HbPAL was constitutively expressed in all tissues examined, most highly in young leaves. The HbPAL gene was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) after infection with Rigidoporus microporus at 0, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post inoculation.

After ten months growth dual-inoculated lavender plants grown in containers with a pasteurized substrate mixture produced a similar number of spikes than healthy plants and achieved equivalent plant diameter coverage. When the growing medium in the autotrophic systems was supplemented with calcium carbonate, the inoculation of lavender plantlets with R. irregularis at higher pH (7. 0 and 8. 5) media caused a significant decrease of A. mellea presence in plant roots, as detected by qPCR.

40|$|One of {{the main}} avocado {{diseases}} in southern Spain is <b>white</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> caused by the fungus Rosellinia necatrix Prill. The use of organic soil amendments to enhance the suppressiveness of natural soil is an inviting approach that has successfully controlled other soilborne pathogens. This study tested the suppressive capacity of different organic amendments against R. necatrix and analyzed their effects on soil microbial communities and enzymatic activities. Two-year-old avocado trees were grown in soil treated with composted organic amendments and then used for inoculation assays. All of the organic treatments reduced disease development in comparison to unamended control soil, especially yard waste (YW) and almond shells (AS). The YW had a strong effect on microbial communities in bulk soil and produced larger population levels and diversity, higher hydrolytic activity and strong changes in the bacterial community composition of bulk soil, suggesting a mechanism of general suppression. Amendment with AS induced more subtle changes in bacterial community composition and specific enzymatic activities, with the strongest effects observed in the rhizosphere. Even if the effect was not strong, the changes caused by AS in bulk soil microbiota {{were related to the}} direct inhibition of R. necatrix by this amendment, most likely being connected to specific populations able to recolonize conducive soil after pasteurization.

40|$|Pseudomonas chlororaphis PCL 1606 was {{isolated}} from rhizosphere of healthy avocado trees, growing {{in an area}} affected by <b>white</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> (caused by Rosellinia necatrix), {{which is one of}} the most important diseases for avocado crops. PCL 1606 revealed strong antagonist activity against R. necatrix, mainly due to the production of the antifungal compound 2 -hexyl, 5 -propyl resorcinol (HPR). HPR is crucial for the biocontrol activity, and is involved in bacterial colonisation of the avocado root surface. In this word, we elucidated if PCL 1606 also presents plant-growth promoting (PGPR) activity as an additional mechanism involved in biological control. To study such PGPR activity, in vitro assays with tomato seedlings and commercial 6 -month-old avocado plants were performed. Additionally, activities related with PGPR activity, such as 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate (ACC) deaminase activity, indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) production, phosphate solubilization or production of siderophores, were also tested. The obtained results showed that P. chlororaphis strain PCL 1606 does not present plant growth promoting activity as an additional trait to its biocontrol ability. Universidad de MÃ¡laga.

40|$|<b>Root</b> <b>rot</b> {{severely}} constrains bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) {{production in}} parts of Western Kenya. Genetic and soil management options were evaluated for an integrated <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> management approach. Four hundred genotypes were progressively screened {{in the field for}} resistance to root not over six seasons. A sequence of problem-solving trials on cultural methods was conducted over four seasons. All trials were conducted in <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> infested fields of farmers. No resistant varieties were found in the Kenyan germplasm collection of 374 accessions. Ten resistant varieties were identified from 26 introductions which were known to be resistant to <b>root</b> <b>rots</b> in Rwanda. Farmers preferred MLB- 49 - 89 a because of its early maturity, SCAM 80 -CM/ 5 and RWR 532 because of their high yield and seed type, and the late maturing RWR 719 as it was seen as a replacement for a previously popular cultivar which succumbed to <b>root</b> <b>rots.</b> Crop tolerance to <b>root</b> <b>rots</b> was greatly improved by improving soil fertility through application of diammonium phosphate or certain organic manures, and less so by sowing on ridges. Application of several rapidly decomposing green manures, including Tithonia diversifolia which was abundantly available in field borders, resulted in improved crop tolerance to <b>root</b> <b>rot.</b> Peer-reviewe...|$|R
50|$|Phytophthora <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> {{was first}} {{reported}} in the blueberry plant in 1963. In plants surveyed in North Carolina {{it was found that}} 40% of plants were infected. Symptoms of <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> include yellowing or reddening of leaves, heavy defoliation, and stunted plant growth. Today current USDA estimates are that 80% of eastern blueberry acres are infected with <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> and {{it has the potential to}} reduce yields by up to 25%.|$|R
40|$|Ganoderma spp. is {{a serious}} concern in {{commercial}} plantations of Acacia mangium in Indonesia. This study surveyed <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> incidence and spatial arrangement in commercial plantations and trials. In second rotation commercial plantations in Sumatra and Kalimantan, <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> incidence was recorded between 3 and 28 % in trees aged from {{three to five years}} old. The compartments surveyed in Riau province and East Kalimantan had significantly higher <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> than South Sumatra. In a progeny trial of A. mangium in Java, <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> incidence was surveyed twice, when trees were eight and again at nine years old. <b>Root</b> <b>rot</b> incidence was about 7 and 13 % respectively. Spatial analysis by distance indices (SADIE) revealed that infected trees were randomly distributed at the first time point but tended to become aggregated {{by the time of the}} second survey. This highlights the probability of vegetative spread of the fungus after initial introduction to the site.
