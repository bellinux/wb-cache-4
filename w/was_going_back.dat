5|$|After the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, a {{messenger}} from Black Hawk had shouted to the militiamen that the starving British Band <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> across the Mississippi and would fight no more. No {{one in the}} American camp understood the message, however, since their Ho-Chunk guides were not present to interpret. Black Hawk may have believed that the Americans had gotten the message, {{and that they had}} not pursued him after the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. He apparently expected that the Americans were going to let his band recross the Mississippi unmolested.|$|E
5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} David Eick {{opined that}} [...] "33" [...] was the [...] "silver bullet" [...] that ultimately tipped the scales {{in their favor}} and convinced the Sci Fi Channel {{to pick up the}} series. [...] The network's biggest concern in picking up the series was that Battlestar Galactica would fall victim to the same trappings of space opera as other television properties (Star Trek, Andromeda, Stargate). [...] Two aspects that assuaged these concerns were specifically discussed in the episode's DVD commentary. [...] First, [...] "33" [...] went into Gaius Baltar's (James Callis) mind and visited his house on Caprica (shot in Lions Bay, British Columbia); being swept away by the blue skies and beaches in his fantasy was not the sort of imagery expected of space opera-type shows. [...] Second <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to the devastated Caprica and following-up with Helo's (Tahmoh Penikett) story.|$|E
500|$|In August 2009, Milian {{confirmed}} {{that she had}} signed a deal to release Elope through Interscope Records, with a 2010 release date. Originally scheduled {{to be released in}} 2009, Tricky Stewart explained the delay, saying [...] "we just got our label deals done, so the reason why some of these projects got delayed had to do with technicalities and things of that nature". The album has been furthered delayed because of Milian's marriage to The-Dream and her pregnancy. In January 2010, Milian said that she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> into the studio in the summer to record more material. Although the album had already been finished when Milian took a break for her pregnancy, she wanted to [...] "go back and re-do some of the music and make some new songs and find my new inspiration". In October 2009, Tricky Stewart said that another single had yet to be chosen, {{and that it would be}} the first single off Elope. Reported choices for the first single include [...] "Zipper", [...] "I'm a Cheat", and [...] "Supersonic".|$|E
500|$|To Britain's {{alarm and}} indignation, the Portuguese {{government}} announced on 21 September that Nogueira had accepted [...] "a letter of introduction" [...] from Reedman, conferring upon him the title [...] "Chief of the Rhodesian Mission", with powers {{to deal with}} the Portuguese Foreign Ministry in Luso-Rhodesian matters without British interference. This followed the precedent set by Reedman's counterpart in South Africa, the statement said. Speaking publicly in Salisbury the same evening, Dupont told reporters that there had never been any intention to claim ambassadorial status for Reedman, and that Rhodesia had constantly kept Britain informed of what was happening regarding the appointment. So far as he was concerned, he said, the Rhodesian government had achieved its objective of attaining an independent diplomatic representative in Portugal, and had not exceeded its mandate in any way while doing so. Britain protested strenuously, saying Portugal <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> on its word. Portugal insisted that its reception of Reedman and his Lisbon mission did not prejudice Britain's responsibility over Rhodesia, and was justified because of the long-standing ties between Portugal and Rhodesia, as well as their common involvement in many southern African issues.|$|E

500|$|In June 2000, id Software's game engine {{designer}} John Carmack posted {{an internal}} company plan announcing {{a remake of}} Doom using next generation technology. This plan revealed controversy had been growing within id Software over remaking Doom. Kevin Cloud and Adrian Carmack, two of id Software's owners, were always strongly opposed to remaking Doom, believing that id <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to the same formulas and properties too often. However, after the positive reception to Return to Castle Wolfenstein and the latest improvements in rendering technology, most of the employees agreed that a remake was the right idea and presented the two owners with an ultimatum: allow them to remake Doom or fire them. After the reasonably amicable confrontation (although artist Paul Steed, one of the instigators, was fired in retaliation), the agreement to work on Doom 3 was made. id Software began development on Doom 3 in late 2000, immediately after finishing [...] In 2001, it was first shown {{to the public at}} Macworld Conference & Expo in Tokyo and was later demonstrated at E3 2002, where a fifteen-minute gameplay demo was shown.

Back then—because I didn't know many people in Sweden who knew about rap, it was like my own music world—where the lyrics were very direct.

2500|$|The {{transformation}} {{was accelerated}} during Ralea's last 15 years of life. Around 1950, Ralea was studying Marxist aesthetics and Marxist literary criticism, advising young literati, {{and his colleague}} Vianu, to do the same. Ralea <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> on his cosmopolitanism, seeing it {{as an obstacle to}} the proper understanding of Romanian society. In Explicarea omului, Vianu notes, he brought up [...] "a fundamental cultural motif, man's urge to create himself obstacles and consequently break through them with his natural instinct [...]" [...] According to Ralea, brute ethics existed as [...] "a mechanism for social self-regulation", which helped to distill the [...] "vital impulse", whereas the accomplished human being would internalize its requirements and verify them against his own rationality. Overall, Ralea contended that [...] "dialectical materialism has the complete answer to any fundamental issue regarding social structuring". That answer was in [...] "superstructures", and the references were Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, alongside Ludwig Klages and Max Scheler. According to philosopher François Evain, Ralea's study failed as a work of psychological anthropology, and merely showed [...] "what superstructures become under Marxist materialism." [...] Contrarily, critic Antonio Patraș noted the links between Explicarea omului (a [...] "brilliant study") and Ralea's earlier contributions to sociology.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with 'MaximoTV' on April 12, 2010, Ciara announced that the album would be titled, Basic Instinct. The title {{was inspired by the}} 1992 film of the same name, which starred Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas. Stone's character, Catherine Tramell, was a beautiful, seductive, and stealthy crime writer. Ciara told the interviewer [...] "When you get the record, you're gonna get a really fun vibe. You're gonna get an even more sensual side and also confident and cocky. I got like such an attitude on this record, but in such a fun way." [...] One song which follows this theme is [...] "I Run It," [...] Rap-Up described it as a sensual slow jam. The new album is said to sound much like Ciara's debut album, Goodies, and her 2006 single, [...] "Promise," [...] following on from comments made by Tricky Stewart that Ciara <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> to her roots with this album. Meanwhile, she told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul magazine, that [...] "Basic Instinct is really about her trusting her instinct and going back to the R/urban basics in her music – like where she first started, in the days of [...] "Goodies" [...] and [...] "1, 2 Step." [...] In a later interview with Maxim, she said [...] "The album is about our basic wants and desires. But I have to say, Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct was smart, a little shady, and she definitely had a sexy gangsta thing going on." ...|$|E
