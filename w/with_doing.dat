5|$|Slessor held several {{operational}} commands in the Second World War. As Air Officer Commanding Coastal Command in 1943 and 1944, he {{was credited}} <b>with</b> <b>doing</b> much {{to turn the}} tide of the Battle of the Atlantic through his use of long-range bombers against German U-boats. He was knighted in June 1943. In the closing stages of the war he became Commander-in-Chief RAF Mediterranean and Middle East and deputy to Lieutenant General Ira Eaker as Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, conducting operations in the Italian Campaign and Yugoslavia. Slessor went on {{to serve in the}} RAF's most senior post, Chief of the Air Staff, in the early 1950s, and was considered a strong proponent of strategic bombing and the nuclear deterrent. In retirement he published two more books, including an autobiography, and held ceremonial appointments in Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Appointed AOC Coastal Command {{with the}} acting rank of air marshal on 5 February 1943, Slessor had at his {{disposal}} sixty squadrons, two of which were equipped with B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. He was credited <b>with</b> <b>doing</b> much to turn the tide of the Battle of the Atlantic in the Allies' favour by employing his thinly stretched long-range bomber force against the U-boat threat, in close cooperation with naval forces. Promoted temporary air marshal on 1 June 1943, he was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1943 Birthday Honours. Slessor became Commander-in-Chief RAF Mediterranean and Middle East in January 1944, and deputy to Lieutenant General Ira Eaker as Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Allied Air Forces. In this role he conducted operations in the Italian Campaign and Yugoslavia, establishing the Balkan Air Force in the latter theatre. Slessor joined the Air Council as Air Member for Personnel on 5 April 1945. His rank of air marshal became substantive on 6 June. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Greek Order of the Phoenix on 6 September 1946. His war service also earned him appointment as a Commander of the Belgian Order of Leopold on 27 August 1948, and a Knight Grand Cross of the Norwegian Order of St. Olav on 6 March 1953.|$|E

40|$|Direct {{removal of}} the ossified mass via {{anterior}} approach carries good decompression to ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) in the cervical spine. Ossification occasionally involves not only the posterior longitudinal ligament but also the underlying dura mater, which increased the opportunity of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage or neurological damage. The surgeon was required to recognize the dural ossification (DO) and need more cautious manipulation. Hida et al. first described the computed tomography (CT) findings that indicated the association <b>with</b> <b>DO,</b> and suggest the double-layer sign appeared more specific for DO. This study reviewed 138 patients who received anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) for OPLL, and 40 patients {{were found in the}} association <b>with</b> <b>DO</b> during anterior procedure. Radiological studies revealed that the patients with severe OPLL (higher occupying rate and larger extent) have increasing opportunity of association <b>with</b> <b>DO.</b> The double-layer sign, as a specific indicator for association <b>with</b> <b>DO</b> was sensitive in the patients with mild OPLL, but less frequent in those with severe OPLL <b>with</b> <b>DO.</b> Two surgical techniques were used for the patients <b>with</b> <b>DO</b> in anterior decompression procedure. When the double-layer sign was observed on CT scans, the OPLL could be separated from DO through a thin layer consisting a nonossified degenerated PLL to avoid CSF leakage. Otherwise, the entire ossified mass including OPLL and DO was removed completely. In this technique, the arachnoid membrane needed to be persevered with the aid of microscope to avoid a large area of membrane defect, resulting in uncontrolled CSF leakage. There {{was no significant difference in}} clinical results between the patients <b>with</b> <b>DO</b> and those without DO. Therefore, ACCF is meritorious for the patient with OPLL associated <b>with</b> <b>DO,</b> although more difficult manipulation and higher risk of CSF leakage...|$|R

25|$|The Su-57 has a blended wing body {{fuselage}} and incorporates all-moving {{horizontal and}} vertical stabilizers; the vertical stabilizers toe inwards {{to serve as the}} aircraft's airbrake. The aircraft incorporates thrust vectoring and has adjustable leading edge vortex controllers (LEVCONs) designed to control vortices generated by the leading edge root extensions, and can provide trim and improve high angle of attack behaviour, including a quick stall recovery if the thrust vectoring system fails. The advanced flight control system and thrust vectoring nozzles make the aircraft departure resistant and highly maneuverable in both pitch and yaw, enabling the aircraft to perform very high angles of attack maneuvers such as the Pugachev's Cobra and the Bell maneuver, along <b>with</b> <b>doing</b> flat rotations with little altitude loss. The aircraft's high cruising speed and normal operating altitude is also expected to give it a significant kinematic advantage over prior generations of aircraft.|$|E
25|$|As theorists such as Ronald Coase {{have pointed}} out, all {{business}} organizations represent {{an attempt to}} avoid certain costs associated <b>with</b> <b>doing</b> business. Each is meant to facilitate the contribution of specific resources - investment capital, knowledge, relationships, and so forth - towards a venture which will prove profitable to all contributors. Except for the partnership, all business forms are designed to provide limited liability to both {{members of the organization}} and external investors. Business organizations originated with agency law, which permits an agent to act on behalf of a principal, in exchange for the principal assuming equal liability for the wrongful acts committed by the agent. For this reason, all partners in a typical general partnership may be held liable for the wrongs committed by one partner. Those forms that provide limited liability are able to do so because the state provides a mechanism by which businesses that follow certain guidelines will be able to escape the full liability imposed under agency law. The state provides these forms because it has an interest in the strength of the companies that provide jobs and services therein, but also has an interest in monitoring and regulating their behavior.|$|E
25|$|Patel {{travelled}} {{to attend}} schools in Nadiad, Petlad, and Borsad, living self-sufficiently with other boys. He reputedly cultivated a stoic character. A popular anecdote recounts how he lanced his own painful boil without hesitation, {{even as the}} barber charged <b>with</b> <b>doing</b> it trembled. When Patel passed his matriculation at the relatively late age of 22, he was generally regarded by his elders as an unambitious man destined for a commonplace job. Patel himself, though, harboured a plan to study to become a lawyer, work and save funds, travel to England, and study to become a barrister. Patel spent years away from his family, studying on his own with books borrowed from other lawyers, passing his examinations within two years. Fetching his wife Jhaverba from his parents' home, Patel set up his household in Godhra and was called to the bar. During the many years it took him to save money, Patel– now an advocate– {{earned a reputation as}} a fierce and skilled lawyer. The couple had a daughter, Maniben, in 1904 and a son, Dahyabhai, in 1906. Patel also cared for a friend suffering from Bubonic plague when it swept across Gujarat. When Patel himself came down with the disease, he immediately sent his family to safety, left his home, and moved into an isolated house in Nadiad (by other accounts, Patel spent this time in a dilapidated temple); there, he recovered slowly.|$|E

500|$|In 1971, Sagan {{organized}} a concert with singer Joan Baez, {{one of her}} Atherton neighbors, {{in order to raise}} money for Greek political prisoners; the concert drew more than 10,000 people.

[...] In the three years that followed, Sagan traveled throughout the American West, founding 75 more AI chapters. By 1978, AI USA's membership had increased to 70,000, more than 100 times that of a decade before. An AI spokesman later attributed Sagan <b>with</b> <b>doing</b> more than anyone to establish Amnesty International in the US, adding that [...] "I think she has probably organized more people {{than anyone else in the}} human rights movement globally".

500|$|The impracticability of a gun-type bomb using {{plutonium}} {{was agreed}} {{at a meeting}} in Los Alamos on 17 July 1944. All gun-type work in the Manhattan Project was directed at the Little Boy, enriched-uranium gun design, and the Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized, with almost all of the research oriented around the problems of implosion for the Fat Man bomb. The idea of using shaped charges as three-dimensional explosive lenses came from James L. Tuck, and was developed by von Neumann. To overcome the difficulty of synchronizing multiple detonations, Luis Alvarez and Lawrence Johnston invented exploding-bridgewire detonators to replace the less precise primacord detonation system. Robert Christy is credited <b>with</b> <b>doing</b> the calculations that showed how a solid subcritical sphere of plutonium could be compressed to a critical state, greatly simplifying the task, since earlier efforts had attempted the more-difficult compression of a hollow spherical shell. After Christy's report, the solid-plutonium core weapon was referred to as the [...] "Christy Gadget".|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Stroke due to {{internal}} carotid artery dissection is considered {{to have a good}} prognosis. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the prognosis of {{internal carotid artery}} dissection is worse than classically reported by comparing the characteristics of patients who had an acute ischemic stroke admitted to a population-based primary care center with internal carotid artery occlusion due to either dissection (DO) or atherothrombosis (AO). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 3502 patients admitted to our population-based primary care center, DO (n = 73) was diagnosed by angiography or magnetic resonance imaging, while AO (n = 81) was diagnosed by angiography. The characteristics of patients <b>with</b> <b>DO</b> or AO were compared using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Patients <b>with</b> <b>DO</b> were younger (mean [SD] age, 44. 6 [10] vs. 60. 1 [10] years, P&lt;. 001), had fewer vascular risk factors, and presented more frequently with global middle cerebral artery territory involvement (42 % vs. 17 %, P&lt;. 05) and less frequently with watershed infarcts (3 % vs. 19 %, P&lt;. 05) than patients with AO. Unexpectedly, patients <b>with</b> <b>DO</b> were noted to have more severe clinical impairment, with an increased frequency of decreased consciousness, and a poorer outcome at 1 month. Multivariate analysis showed that the independent factors associated <b>with</b> <b>DO</b> were age younger than 55 years, nonsmoker, no history of hypertension, headache at presentation, and global aphasia. CONCLUSIONS: Patients <b>with</b> <b>DO</b> are younger and are initially seen with fewer risk factors than patients with AO, but their clinical features and prognosis are worse. Large infarcts involving the whole middle cerebral artery territory that {{may be due to the}} lack of collateral circulation are responsible for the bad prognosis of patients <b>with</b> <b>DO...</b>|$|R
500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media.

She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Kumi Tanioka has {{described}} the musical style for the soundtrack to Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles as being based on [...] "ancient instruments". She says that the idea came to her while looking at illustrations of the game world, which gave her {{the idea of making}} [...] "world music", where the tracks would [...] "not [...] limited to a single country or culture". She also credits Hidenori Iwasaki, the synthesizer operator for the game, <b>with</b> <b>doing</b> [...] "fantastic technical work" [...] that brought her vision to life. For the soundtrack to Ring of Fates, Tanioka purposefully did not focus on [...] "world music", instead focusing on [...] "creating a new landscape containing the same atmosphere". The piano performances in the Ring of Fates soundtrack were done by Kumi Tanioka. She did the performances herself rather than use an outside performer as most Final Fantasy soundtracks have done primarily because she [...] "likes to play piano", and were done without any sheet music, as she preferred instead to improvise. She took extensive piano lessons as a child, and lists piano and choral music as the biggest influences on her musical style. [...] She also claims to have been influenced by music {{from a wide variety of}} cultures, such as Indonesian, Irish and Balinese music. She will not be composing the soundtrack for The Crystal Bearers; this role will be performed by Hidenori Iwasaki.|$|E
500|$|With the {{pregnancy}} storyline over, Lita {{returned to the}} women's division in November 2004. She began a feud with Trish Stratus, who had constantly degraded her during her pregnancy storyline. When Stratus referred to her as [...] "chubby" [...] because of her weight gain, she retaliated by attacking Stratus backstage due to no longer carrying a child. Lita challenged Stratus to a Women's Championship match at Survivor Series, however, due to the months of humiliation and being verbally berated by Stratus, Lita was more concerned <b>with</b> <b>doing</b> as much damage as possible, leading to her disqualification. The feud continued, and on December 6, Lita defeated Stratus in the main event of Raw to win her second WWE Women's Championship. During {{the course of the}} match, Lita botched a suicide dive to the outside when she over rotated by a fraction, barely escaping serious injury. This move was later used in the buildup to the title rematch she was booked for at New Year's Revolution against Stratus, who claimed, [...] "Lita had to practically kill herself, just to beat me". However, Lita's title reign that was supposed to gain more momentum and length came to a short end almost a month later when Stratus defeated Lita on January 9, 2005, at New Year's Revolution. In the course of the match, Lita tore her left ACL after executing a Thesz press off the ring apron, which left her unable to properly continue the match and led to a rushed finish.|$|E

[...] "My Life in Orange, though slightly patchwork in its construction, is an absorbing piece of writing, all the more compelling for begging as many questions as it answers and for the author's refusal to ask for pity," [...] wrote Geraldine Bedell in a review of the book in The Observer. Director of the Cheltenham Festival of Literature, Christopher Cook, characterized My Life in Orange as [...] "the most extraordinary account of his [...] childhood and the bravest writing I've read in ages". Sudipta Datta of the Indian Express described the book as [...] "a postcard from the past that the Osho ashram may not rave about." [...] Datta noted though that after having been angry with his mother and Rajneesh, Guest had reconciled with his family, reclaimed his childhood and come to see Rajneesh as [...] "a loveable rogue who got away <b>with</b> <b>doing</b> his own thing". Catherine A. Powers of The Boston Globe characterized the book as a [...] "moving, superbly written account of growing up in the midst of ... cruel madness". Michael E. Young of The Dallas Morning News gave the book a favorable review, and wrote: [...] "The book offers a glimpse into the thoughts of the followers, and examines the fine line between spirituality and insanity, between religion and cult." [...] Shane Hegarty of The Irish Times characterized the book as [...] "an intriguing and often humorous mix of straightforward 1980s nostalgia and cult delusion".|$|E
500|$|The tunnel {{construction}} became unintentionally {{involved in}} the women's rights movement when Janet Bonnema applied for a position as an engineering technician with the Colorado Department of Transportation. She was given an assignment on the Straight Creek Tunnels project, but her supervisor misread her resume and thought he was hiring [...] "James". When the supervisor discovered the department had hired a woman, she was instead tasked <b>with</b> <b>doing</b> support work from the office. There was opposition to a woman entering the construction site: One supervisor stated that if she entered, [...] "Those workers would flat walk out of that there tunnel and they'd never come back". The workers, most of whom had a mining background, expressed a common superstition that a woman brought bad luck to a mine. One worker insisted, [...] "It's a jinx.

She countered she was in better shape and more agile than most of the men working on the tunnel. Emboldened by the passage of an equal rights law in Colorado, she finally entered the tunnel, with an entourage of reporters, on November 9, 1972. Some workers did walk off the job; at least one yelled, [...] "Get those women out of here". She remained determined and re-entered the tunnel a few days later. The next time she dressed in coveralls, and was even assigned tasks {{on the roof of the}} tunnel overlooking the men below.
