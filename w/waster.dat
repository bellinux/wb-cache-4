25|$|In 2013 the Taboada {{wastewater}} treatment plant was commissioned in Lima. With a capacity of 1,8 million cubic meters/day {{it is the largest}} {{wastewater treatment}} plant in South America. It was privately financed as a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) project by the Spanish firm Técnicas de Desalinización de Aguas (Tedagua). It is envisaged that some of the treated water will be used for the irrigation of urban parks. Financing for another {{wastewater treatment plant}} in La Atarjea has been secured in February 2014 through a 48,66 million Euro loan from the German development bank KfW. The treated <b>waster</b> will be reused for irrigation after being discharged into an existing irrigation canal.|$|E
500|$|Carphone Warehouse staff {{nominated}} around 1,000 apps {{from which}} a panel of judges produced a shortlist of 50, announced by Hammond in February 2011. In an online process, about 30,000 votes were cast by the public to choose the winners. Most of the shortlisted apps are free to download but others require a one-off or an ongoing payment. Finland-based Rovio Mobile's 2009 game Angry Birds, which recently passed the 100-million download mark, won the award for Best App of the Year along with a win in the Best Game App category and a nomination in the Best Time <b>Waster</b> App category.

5000|$|<b>Wasters</b> are {{not without}} their faults. The all wooden {{construction}} usually makes <b>wasters</b> somewhat lighter and differently balanced than steel weapons. The difference of material properties between wood and steel creates a difference in performance when training and sparring. The wood <b>wasters</b> tend to recoil from strong contact with other <b>wasters</b> as may occur in a strong parry or absetzen, a phenomenon colloquially referred to as [...] "waster bounce". Steel weapons do not display this attribute to the same extent, usually binding and sliding with minimal rebound instead. The use of wood with rounded edges makes <b>wasters</b> considerably safer for practice than a steel weapon, but does not make them totally safe. Strong cuts or thrusts to vulnerable body parts during sparring may lead to significant injury to the individual. <b>Wasters</b> provide a safer training experience than steel weapons {{at the cost of}} authenticity.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper reviews major {{studies in}} three {{traditional}} lines {{of research in}} residential energy consumption in the UK, i. e., economic/infrastructure, behaviour, and load profiling. Based on the review the paper proposes a three-dimensional model for archetyping residential energy consumers in the UK by considering property energy efficiency levels, the greenness of household behaviour of using energy, and the duration of property daytime occupancy. With the proposed model, eight archetypes of residential energy consumers in the UK have been identified. They are: pioneer greens, follower greens, concerned greens, home stayers, unconscientious <b>wasters,</b> regular <b>wasters,</b> daytime <b>wasters,</b> and disengaged <b>wasters.</b> Using a case study, these archetypes of residential energy consumers demonstrate the robustness of the 3 -D model in aiding local energy policy/intervention design in the UK...|$|R

Nay, {{even if he had}} been wicked, a <b>waster,</b> she would have been more free. She would have had something to resist, at least. A <b>waster</b> stands for something, really. He says: 'No, I will not aid and abet society in this business of increase and hanging together, I will upset the apple-cart as much as I can, in my small way.' Or else he says: 'No, I will not bother about others. If I have lusts, they are my own, and I prefer them to other people's virtues.' So, a <b>waster,</b> a scamp, takes a sort of stand. He exposes himself to opposition and final castigation: at any rate in story-books.|$|E
