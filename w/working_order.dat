5|$|During {{the course}} of the battle, two of Von der Tanns main turrets were knocked out by British gunfire, while her other two turrets {{suffered}} mechanical failures. The ship was firing so fast that several of the main guns in the amidships turrets became overheated and jammed in their recoil slides, and could not be returned to <b>working</b> <b>order.</b> Von der Tann was without her main battery for 11hours, although three turrets were restored to <b>working</b> <b>order</b> {{before the end of the}} battle; Dturret only after much cutting away of bent metal with oxyacetylene torches—afterwards the guns could be worked only by hand. Her casualties amounted to 11 dead and 35 wounded. During the battle Von der Tann fired 170 heavy shells and 98 secondary caliber shells.|$|E

In 2002, according to the National Association Of Shortwave Broadcasters, for estimated numbers of households with at least one shortwave set in <b>working</b> <b>order,</b> Asia led with a large majority, followed by Europe, Sub Saharan Africa, and the former Soviet Union, respectively. The total estimated number of households worldwide with at least one shortwave set in <b>working</b> <b>order</b> was said to be 600,000,000. SWLs are varied, with no common age or occupation.

5|$|Computers may be {{impacted}} by volcanic ash, with their functionality and usability decreasing during ashfall, {{but it is}} unlikely they will completely fail. The most vulnerable components are the mechanical components, such as cooling fans, cd drives, keyboard, mice and touch pads. These components can become jammed with fine grained ash causing them to cease working; however, most can be restored to <b>working</b> <b>order</b> by cleaning with compressed air. Moist ash may cause electrical short circuits within desktop computers; however, will not affect laptop computers.|$|E

[...] Wintour ordered him to verify the news, and on confirming that the government were seeking Thomas Percy (for whom Fawkes, using the alias [...] "John Johnson", claimed to be <b>working),</b> <b>ordered</b> him to alert Percy. Christopher and Percy left London together, heading for Dunstable.|$|R

5|$|Connected to a {{spur of the}} Stobcross Railway, the crane's {{primary purpose}} was the lifting of heavy machinery, such as tanks and steam {{locomotives}}, onto ships for export. As many as 30,000 locomotives were hauled {{through the streets of}} Glasgow by Clydesdale horses, traction engines and diesel tractors, from the works at Springburn to the crane for export to the British Empire. The crane is (as of 1988) not in <b>working</b> <b>order,</b> but is retained {{as a symbol of the}} city's engineering heritage.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} phase of attacks, shipping, coastal airfields, radar and {{stations}} south of London were attacked during 8–18 August. The Luftwaffe gradually increased the frequency of attacks. German bombers also raided targets as far north as Liverpool during night hours. The first major raid inland and against RAF airfields came on 12 August. RAF Hawkinge, Lympne, Manston and radar stations at Pevensey, Rye and Dover were to be destroyed. Portsmouth docks were also targeted. The results of the raids were mixed. The Radar station at Ventnor was badly damaged and others targeted were also damaged, but not destroyed. All were in <b>working</b> <b>order</b> by the following morning. The attacks against the harbour and RAF stations had failed to destroy them. All were not in fully <b>working</b> <b>order</b> {{by the end of the}} day, but were back in action the following morning. Unknown to German intelligence, Lympne itself was not even an operational station. This sort of intelligence blunder contributed to the failure of Adlertag.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} and testing of the critical detonators was shared between Lauritsen's group at Caltech and Robert Henderson's group at Los Alamos. By mid-1945, the object was to produce 1,000 detonators each week. Meeting this target proved challenging. Reliability was the key problem, with initial batches containing unacceptably high numbers of failures. In May 1945, a box of detonators manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck and tumbled down a mountain side, but were found to still be in <b>working</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E

5|$|While other closed {{stations}} on {{the former}} MR lines north of Aylesbury were generally demolished or sold, in 1969 the Quainton Railway Society was formed to operate a working museum at the station. On 24 April 1971 the society absorbed the London Railway Preservation Society, taking custody of its collection of historic railway equipment. The station was maintained in <b>working</b> <b>order</b> and used as a bookshop and ticket office, and the sidings—still intact, although disconnected from the railway line in 1967—were used for locomotive restoration work.|$|E

Southdown Old Farmhouse is a small manor which dates from the 18th century and has undergone 20th century restorations and extensions; the manor was designated as a listed building on 31 May 1985. Another Grade II listed building is a Victorian wheelhouse with a donkey wheel which lies immediately southwest of Southdown Old Farmhouse. The wheelhouse was built in the early 19th century and consists of weatherboarded timber frames on brick plinths.

5|$|Planned at short notice, {{the mission}} {{followed}} an offer by the Italian government {{to open the}} ports of Taranto and Brindisi on the heel of Italy to the Allies. The airborne division was selected to undertake the mission, {{but at the time}} they were located in North Africa. A shortage of transport aircraft meant the division could not land in their traditional way by parachute and glider, and all the landing craft in the area were already allocated to the other landings: Operation Avalanche at Salerno on the western coast, and Operation Baytown at Calabria. Instead, the division had to be transported across the Mediterranean by ships of the Royal Navy. The landing was unopposed and the airborne division successfully captured the ports of Taranto, and later Brindisi on the Adriatic coast in <b>working</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E
