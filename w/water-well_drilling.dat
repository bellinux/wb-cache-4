5000|$|Layne {{started in}} 1882 as a <b>water-well</b> <b>drilling</b> company in South Dakota. Through various acquisitions, {{proprietary}} rights ownerships, and expansions, Layne now has over 40 offices and affiliates in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and South America. [...] During its growth, Layne {{has evolved from}} a <b>water-well</b> <b>drilling</b> company to global water management, construction and drilling company that provides services to the water, mineral and energy sectors.|$|E
50|$|Humanitarian and MMA fighter Justin Wren {{contracted}} Malaria, which devolved into Blackwater fever, while <b>drilling</b> <b>water-wells</b> for Congo Pygmies in 2013. The affliction nearly claimed Wren's life. He was misdiagnosed {{four times}} and required airlift to Uganda, where he narrowly recovered from severe symptoms.|$|R
5000|$|Today, 2 mi {{of trail}} have been {{developed}} from the 7 mi of explored cave. A steel gate was installed on June 15, 1957 {{at the entrance to}} protect the cave from vandalism. The cave was then re-named [...] "Secret Cave" [...] to protect its location.In 1957, James Papadakis a geologist, caver and professional photographer {{fell in love with the}} cave. During Papadakis's many trips to the cave, he observed that the delicate cave formations were being destroyed. James realized the only way to protect the [...] "Secret Cave" [...] would be to open it to the public as a showcase cave with guided tours. He negotiated a lease with Stanley Mansfield. The lease was signed in February 1960. Papadakis negotiated with the REA. Development of the cave project began, which included a fenced access road, two miles of power line, a telephone line, a <b>water-well</b> was <b>drilled</b> and a small visitor center was built. James hired friend and caver, Jack Busch to help construct the trails and install electrical lighting which provided safe viewing for public tours.|$|R
50|$|A {{range of}} water-level and water-well {{information}} is available through the KGS website and the Data Resources Library in Lawrence. Inquiries for these data have increased due to ongoing drought conditions {{in the state and}} concerns over water-level declines in the High Plains aquifer. With KGS support, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment released a program that allows online submission of digital <b>water-well</b> <b>drilling</b> records.|$|E

Tenant units include the U.S. Marine Security Forces which provides the camp's external security, the CJTF-HOA commander and staff, a U.S. Navy Seabee battalion which conducts <b>water-well</b> <b>drilling</b> operations, U.S. Army units which provide additional security, military training, and Civil-military operations support, and several aircraft detachments.|$|E
50|$|The primary RED HORSE tasking {{in peacetime}} is {{to train for}} {{contingency}} and wartime operations. It participates regularly in Joint Chiefs of Staff and major command exercises, military operations other than war, and civic action programs. RED HORSE performs training projects that assist base construction efforts while, at the same time, honing wartime skills. Air Force RED HORSE units possess special capabilities, such as <b>water-well</b> <b>drilling,</b> explosive demolition, aircraft arresting system installation, quarry operations, concrete mobile operations, material testing, expedient facility erection, and concrete and asphalt paving.|$|E
50|$|Resistivity logging is {{sometimes}} used in mineral exploration (especially exploration for iron and potassium) and <b>water-well</b> <b>drilling,</b> but most commonly for formation evaluation in oil- and gas-well drilling. Most rock materials are essentially insulators, while their enclosed fluids are conductors. Hydrocarbon fluids are an exception, {{because they are}} almost infinitely resistive. When a formation is porous and contains salty water, the overall resistivity will be low. When the formation contains hydrocarbon, or contains very low porosity, its resistivity will be high. High resistivity values may indicate a hydrocarbon bearing formation.|$|E
5000|$|Gamma ray logging is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} naturally occurring gamma radiation to characterize the rock or sediment in a borehole or drill hole. It is a wireline logging method used in mining, mineral exploration, <b>water-well</b> <b>drilling,</b> for formation evaluation in oil and gas well drilling and for other related purposes. [...] Different types of rock emit different amounts and different spectra of natural gamma radiation. In particular, shales usually emit more gamma rays than other sedimentary rocks, such as sandstone, gypsum, salt, coal, dolomite, or limestone because radioactive potassium is a common component in their clay content, and because the cation exchange capacity of clay causes them to absorb uranium and thorium. This difference in radioactivity between shales and sandstones/carbonate rocks allows the gamma tool to distinguish between shales and non-shales.|$|E
40|$|Subsurface {{geologic}} {{information is}} essential {{to much of the}} research performed by the Minnesota Geological Survey. The principal research activities that draw upon this data are bedrock and surficial geologic mapping, hydrogeologic mapping, and mineral resource evaluation. In addition, the Minnesota Geological Survey provides subsurface geologic information to the public and to government organizations such as the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Minnesota Department of Health, Regional Development Commissions, Soil and Water Conservation Districts, and the U. S. Geological Survey. Each of these activities is made more efficient by maintaining subsurface data in computer data bases. The principal sources of subsurface geologic data are records of <b>water-well</b> <b>drilling,</b> engineering test boring, and mineral exploration drilling. These three different kinds of records vary in data content and quality. For this reason the Minnesota Geological Survey employs three separate but compatible subsurface geology data bases, one corresponding to each type of data source. This report describes the water-well portion of the subsurface geology data base. Water-well records contain high-quality water-level observations and low- to medium-quality geologic information on the materials encountered during drilling. In addition, they often include data on pumpage tests and well use, and a description of the well construction. Water-well data is used extensively in mapping by the Minnesota Geological Survey and is frequently supplied in map or tabular form to the public and {{to a wide variety of}} government organizations. Because the water-well data base includes Public Land Survey coordinates for each well, the data is readily transmitted to the Minnesota Land Management Information System. Water-well data so transmitted will be a major component of the newly created Systems for Water Information Management (SWIM) of the Water Planning Board. The purpose of this report is twofold: 1) to acquaint current and potential users of the water-well data base with its contents and usefulness, and 2) to serve as a detailed user's reference manual...|$|E
