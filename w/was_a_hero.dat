5|$|MacLaren {{had many}} jobs as he {{attempted}} {{to find ways to}} support his cricket, family and lifestyle. At various time, he worked as a teacher, a journalist and a cricket coach. For many years, he was employed as Lancashire's assistant secretary but such were his financial worries that he often had to ask for cash advances from the committee, with which he had a stormy relationship. He worked for several years as private secretary to K. S. Ranjitsinhji and he became involved in his employer's financial scandals. Many of MacLaren's later business ventures were failures, and only when his wife came into an inheritance did he and his family live in comfort. Throughout his life, MacLaren was involved in many disagreements and was never popular with teammates. However, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> to the cricket writer Neville Cardus, who wrote prolifically on him. MacLaren died in 1944, aged 72.|$|E

The child's parents wanted Boelcke to be awarded the French Legion d'Honneur; instead, he received the Prussian Lifesaving Medal.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{his history}} of brutal acts and savagery, there was enough in his undoubted courage, his many fights against heavy odds, his {{occasional}} acts of mercy and charity, his conventional piety and calculated courting of publicity to ensure that Lampião entered Brazilian folk-history as a hero. One of the more dispassionate analyses of Lampião concluded that, if he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero,</b> he was an anarchist hero who forged a prominent place for himself in a society and political environment where people put their own interests above all other considerations.|$|E

25|$|Young Garesche, as he {{was known}} to his parents, was the {{youngest}} surviving son of 15 children and born in Michigan in 1866. His father, the then Captain Edward Otho Cresap Ord (October 18, 1818 Maryland – July 22, 1883 in Havana, Cuba and buried on July 22, 1898 in Arlington Cemetery), married Mary Mercer Thompson (January 22, 1831 Virginia – July 15, 1894 San Antonio, Texas) on October 14, 1854. His father was a career military officer who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> in the Civil War and had served as a Major General of Volunteers. After the war, he reverted to being a Brigadier General in the Regular Army.|$|E
25|$|David Dixon Porter {{obtained}} {{an official}} appointment as midshipman in the U.S. Navy through his grandfather, US Congressman William Anderson. The appointment was dated February 2, 1829, {{when he was}} sixteen years of age; this was somewhat older than many midshipmen, {{some of whom had}} been taken in as boys. Due to his relative maturity and experience, greater than that of most naval lieutenants, Porter tended to be cocky and challenge some of his superiors, leading to conflict. Except for intervention by Commodore James Biddle, who acted favorably because Porter's father <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero,</b> his warrant as a midshipman would not have been renewed.|$|E
25|$|Young Edward Ord was {{the eldest}} male of 15 {{children}} (13 lived past childhood) and {{was born at}} Beneficial Barracks, San Francisco, {{now part of the}} Benicia Arsenal, Benicia, California on November 9, 1858. His father, the then Captain Edward Otho Cresap Ord (October 18, 1818 in Maryland – July 22, 1883 in Havana, Cuba and buried on July 22, 1898 in Arlington National Cemetery), married Mary Mercer Thompson (January 22, 1831 in Virginia – July 15, 1894 in San Antonio, Texas) on October 14, 1854.

25|$|Rosecrans {{once again}} {{found that he}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> in the Northern press. On October 24, he was given command of XIV Corps (which, because he was also given command of the Department of the Cumberland, would soon be renamed the Army of the Cumberland), {{replacing}} the ineffectual Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, who had just fought the inconclusive Battle of Perryville, Kentucky, against Gen. Braxton Bragg, but was accused of moving too cautiously. Rosecrans was promoted {{to the rank of}} major general (of volunteers, as opposed to his brigadier rank in the regular army). The promotion was applied retroactive to March 21, 1862, so that he would outrank fellow Maj. Gen. Thomas; Thomas had earlier been offered Buell's command, but turned down the opportunity {{out of a sense of}} personal loyalty. Grant was not unhappy that Rosecrans was leaving his command.|$|E
25|$|At home Sullivan <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero.</b> The New Hampshire {{legislature}} selected him as {{a delegate}} to the Continental Congress for one year to start in November 1780, against his wishes. Although most of the delegates to Congress were new, Sullivan still had opponents there. Nonetheless, he accepted the position in order that New Hampshire be represented in the controversy concerning claims to Vermont under the New Hampshire Grants. In the absence of other delegates from New Hampshire except the soon to depart Nathaniel Folsom, Sullivan was seated early, on September 11, 1780. Immediately, Sullivan and Folsom {{had to deal with}} the question of whether Vermont would be part of New York or New Hampshire or would be independent. Ultimately, since possible negotiation of Vermont with the British to become a part of Canada was threatened, on August 3, 1781, Sullivan seconded appointment of a committee to negotiate with Vermont on becoming a separate state.|$|E
25|$|While seen as {{an enemy}} of the United States and Colombian governments, Escobar <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> to many in Medellín (especially the poor people). He was a natural at public relations, and he worked to create {{goodwill}} among the poor of Colombia. A lifelong sports fan, he was credited with building football fields and multi-sports courts, as well as sponsoring children's football teams. Escobar was also responsible for the construction of houses and football fields in western Colombia, which gained him popularity among the poor. He worked hard to cultivate his Robin Hood image, and frequently distributed money through housing projects and other civic activities, which gained him notable popularity among the locals of the towns that he frequented. Some people from Medellín often helped Escobar avoid police capture by serving as lookouts, hiding information from authorities, or doing whatever else they could to protect him. At the height of his power, drug traffickers from Medellín and other areas were handing over between 20% and 35% of their Colombian cocaine-related profits to Escobar, as {{he was the one who}} shipped cocaine successfully to the United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{community}} was {{served by the}} Lincoln Academy, then Lincoln High School (see Old Lincoln High School), the first school to serve blacks in Leon County and one of three in the state providing secondary education to African Americans. (President Abraham Lincoln <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> for blacks, but was hated by segregationist whites.) Its first principal was John G. Riley (see John Gilmore Riley House), who had been born a slave, and who {{was head of the}} local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Its final building (the fourth; two destroyed by fire) was located on Brevard Street, but facing the length of Macomb Street. It closed in 1969, when black students were admitted to previously all-white Leon High School. As often happened during desegregation, and as also happened with the Florida A University College of Law and the Florida A Hospital, desegregation meant that the black facility was closed and most of the black teachers, principals, and coaches lost their jobs. The building, today called the Lincoln Center, is used for delivering social services. There is no connection with the current, distant Lincoln High School.|$|E
25|$|In {{the ancient}} past, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> named Hou Yi who was {{excellent}} at archery. His wife was Chang'e. One year, the ten suns {{rose in the}} sky together, causing great disaster to people. Yi shot down nine of the suns and left only one to provide light. An immortal admired Yi and sent him the elixir of immortality. Yi {{did not want to}} leave Chang'e and be immortal without her, so he let Chang'e keep the elixir. But Peng Meng, one of his apprentices, knew this secret. So, on the fifteenth of August in the lunar calendar, when Yi went hunting, Peng Meng broke into Yi's house and forced Chang'e to give the elixir to him. Chang'e refused to do so. Instead, she swallowed it and flew into the sky. Since she loved very much her husband and hoped to live nearby, she chose the moon for her residence. When Yi came back and learned what had happened, he felt so sad that he displayed the fruits and cakes Chang'e liked in the yard and gave sacrifices to his wife. People soon learned about these activities, and since they also were sympathetic to Chang'e they participated in these sacrifices with Yi.|$|E
25|$|The romancers' {{versions}} of Camelot drew on earlier descriptions of Arthur's fabulous court. From Geoffrey's grand description of Caerleon, Camelot gains its impressive architecture, its many churches and the chivalry and courtesy of its inhabitants. Geoffrey's description in turn drew on an already established tradition in Welsh oral {{tradition of the}} grandeur of Arthur's court. The tale Culhwch and Olwen, associated with the Mabinogion and perhaps written in the 11th century, draws a dramatic picture of Arthur's hall and his many powerful warriors who go from there on great adventures, placing it in Celliwig, an uncertain locale in Cornwall. Although the court at Celliwig is the most prominent in remaining early Welsh manuscripts, the various {{versions of}} the Welsh Triads agree in giving Arthur multiple courts, one {{in each of the}} areas inhabited by the Celtic Britons: Cornwall, Wales and the Hen Ogledd. This perhaps reflects the influence of widespread oral traditions common by 800 which are recorded in various place names and features such as Arthur's Seat, indicating Arthur <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero</b> known and associated with many locations across Brittonic areas of Britain as well as Brittany. Even at this stage Arthur could not be tied to one location. Many other places are listed as a location where Arthur holds court in the later romances, Carlisle and London perhaps being the most prominent.|$|E

However, responding to calls that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hero,</b> Arnada stated [...] "I’m not a hero, nor a victim.
