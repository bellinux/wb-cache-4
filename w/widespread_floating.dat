40|$|Global surface {{transport}} {{in the ocean}} can be represented by using the observed trajectories of drifters to calculate probability distribution functions. The oceanographic applications of the Markov Chain approach to modelling include tracking of floating debris and water masses, globally and on yearly-to-centennial timescales. Here, we analyse the error inherent with mapping trajectories onto a grid and the consequences for ocean transport modelling and detection of accumulation structures. A sensitivity analysis of Markov Chain parameters is performed in an idealised Stommel gyre and western boundary current {{as well as with}} observed ocean drifters, complementing previous studies on <b>widespread</b> <b>floating</b> debris accumulation. Focusing on two key areas of inter-ocean exchange - the Agulhas System and the North Atlantic intergyre transport barrier - we assess the capacity of the Markov Chain methodology to detect surface connectivity and dynamic transport barriers. Finally, we extend the methodology's functionality to separate the geostrophic and non-geostrophic contributions to inter-ocean exchange in these key regions...|$|E

The <b>widespread</b> currency <b>floats</b> and devaluations set back aspirations for European monetary union. However, in March 1979 the European Monetary System (EMS) was created, fixing exchange rates onto the European Currency Unit (ECU), an accounting currency, to stabilise exchange rates and counter inflation. It also created the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (EMCF).|$|R
40|$|It {{is usually}} {{assumed that the}} ‘floating’ or {{artificial}} irrigation of water meadows was an innovation of the early modern period. Indeed, many authorities still attribute the technique to the late sixteenth-century improver Rowland Vaughan. There is, however, good evidence that irrigation was already understood and practised on at least a limited scale {{by the start of}} the sixteenth century. It is probable that early irrigation systems normally took the form of catchworks: the key development of the post-medieval centuries was the creation of more sophisticated bedwork systems, which allowed the <b>widespread</b> adoption of <b>floating</b> on the chalklands of southern England...|$|R
