The necessity to account for the plurality connections between the different technological factors, affecting the productivity of processing parts and having a wide range of variation in the process model of intragrinding processing, forces to abandon the narrow-band, partial power-low empirical dependences, which present only the processing conditions similar to the conditions of the experiment. Considering that power limitations of regime parameters are at the basis of the intragrinding operations performance management, we have developed a wide-range analytical model of cutting forces which is required to establish the interrelations between the program and the actual infeeds through the elastic properties of technological system and coverage of the main technological factors, influencing the change of the cutting force.

40|$|Grinding is a {{critical}} manufacturing process and is often the only alternative when producing precision components or when machining brittle materials such as ceramics. Characterizing and modeling the surface finish in the grinding process is a difficult task due to the stochastic nature of the size, shape and spatial distribution of abrasive grains {{that make up the}} surface of grinding wheels. Since the surface finish obtained in grinding is a direct function of the wheel surface topography, which is conditioned by a single point dressing process, understanding the effects of dressing parameters on the wheel topography is essential. Therefore, the main objectives of this thesis are: 1) to experimentally characterize the three-dimensional surface topography of a conventional grinding wheel including attributes such as the abrasive grain height distribution, grain geometry and spacing parameters and their respective statistical distributions, 2) {{to determine the effects of}} single point dressing conditions on the three-dimensional wheel surface topography parameters and their distributions, 3) to model and simulate the three-dimensional wheel surface topography, and 4) to experimentally validate the wheel topography model. In this research, new and existing characterization methods are used to characterize the wheel surface and the individual abrasive grains. The new techniques include the use of X-ray micro-tomography (μCT) to obtain a better understanding of the grinding wheel's internal micro-structure, and a focus variation based optical measurement method and scanning electron microscopy to characterize previously ignored attributes such as the number of sides and aspect ratio of individual grains. A seeded gel (SG) vitrified bond conventional grinding wheel is used in the study. A full factorial design of single point wheel dressing experiments is performed to investigate the effects infeed and lead dressing parameters on the grinding wheel surface topography. A custom wheel indexing apparatus is built to facilitate precision relocation of the grinding wheel surface to enable optical comparison of the pre- and post-dressing wheel surface topography to observe wheel surface generation mechanisms such as macro-fracture and grain dislodgement. Quantitative descriptions of how each dressing parameter affects the wheel surface characteristics are given in terms of the wheel surface roughness amplitude parameters (Sp, Ssk, Sku) and areal and volume parameters (Spk, Sk, Vmp, Vmp, Vvc, Smr 1) derived from the bearing area curve. A three-dimensional wheel topography simulation model that takes as input the abrasive grain height distribution and the statistical distributions for the various abrasive grain geometry parameters is developed and experimentally validated. The results of wheel characterization studies show that the actual abrasive grain height distribution in the SG wheel follows a beta distribution. The μCT work shows that the abrasives are polyhedral in shape, as opposed to the spherical or conical shapes commonly assumed in grinding literature. Grain spacing is found to follow a beta distribution while the number of sides of the grain and the grain aspect ratio are found to follow the gamma and the Weibull distribution, respectively. The results of the dressing study show that the lead dressing parameter has the strongest effect on wheel topography. Using statistical distributions for the key parameters (e. g. grain height, number of sides, grain spacing), a stochastic three-dimensional model is developed to simulate the wheel surface topography under different dressing conditions. The resulting model is shown to yield realistic results compared to existing models mainly due the fact that additional abrasive grain geometry parameters and more realistic assumptions of the different grain attributes are used in the model. It is shown that the model follows the overall wheel surface topography trends during dressing but has difficulty in accurately simulating some of the <b>wheel</b> <b>characteristics</b> under specific dressing conditions. The thesis then concludes with a summary of the main findings and possible future research avenues including extending the model to rotary dressing and simulation of wheel-workpiece interaction. M.

Process management of internal grinding is carried out for a given cycle which simultaneously involves two controlling regime parameters: radial and axial infeeds actively changing in the process of grinding while the other operating parameters are constant during the entire grinding cycle. The developed model allows calculating the changes of the cutting force depending on variable values of infeeds. Fluctuation of infeeds values in each opening section is caused not only by the control program but also the kinematics of the internal grinding process. It should also be noted that the model of the cutting force provided in this article considers kinematics, peculiarities of the internal grinding and connects the cutting force with the processing regimes (radial and axial infeeds, number of billet and wheel revolutions) and main technological factors (physical mechanical properties of grinding metal, geometric parameters of a contact zone of the billet and the <b>wheel,</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>characteristic,</b> degree of blunting, etc.) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{total removal}} of {{grinding}} wheel material includes two main parts.

The frequency of dressing and truing operations depends on the cutting conditions, <b>wheel</b> <b>characteristic,</b> etc. However in dry grinding as there is no cutting fluid to transfer the heat from the contact zone, the wheel wear during grinding and the frequency of dressing is much higher due to the higher grinding forces and temperatures. Vibration grinding reduces wear of the grinding wheel during the process considerably and decreases the frequency of dressing operation significantly. Hence it increases the efficiency of the process and reduces the cost. The investigation carried out in the KSF institute shows the improvement on the surface roughness, reduction of the grinding forces, thermal damage of the ground surface and radial wear of the grinding wheel in case of using vibration grinding comparing to conventional grinding.
