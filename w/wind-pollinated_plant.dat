25|$|In 1998 pollen {{found on}} the Shroud of Turin was {{analysed}} and with 29%, the pollen assigned to Gundelia was the most numerous. Such a high density makes it very unlikely that this would merely {{be the result of}} the Shroud having been exposed to the wind, particularly because Gundelia is an insect-pollinated, not a <b>wind-pollinated</b> <b>plant.</b> Some researchers have suggested this implies that the crown of thorns was made from Gundelia-branches. Other authors doubt the accuracy of the pollen analysis and of the process of gathering the pollen from the Shroud. One reason for doubt is that during the period that pollen is present in the plant, the thorns would have still been tender. It was suggested the pollen is from Helichrysum-species which have a similar type of pollen. Helichrysum was used in classical times to make crowns and garlands for the diseased because they do not wither and remain scented for a long time. An alternative explanation suggested is that rather more recent different flowers have been pressed against the Shroud to create contact relics, while in the process contaminating it with pollen and therefore diluting the original pollen signature.|$|E

Self-fertilization, which is expected to reduce the proportion of sterile hybrids produced in mixed ploidy populations, allowed the hexaploids to avoid the effects of pollen swamping only slightly, and in a density-dependent manner.

30|$|Maize is a <b>wind-pollinated</b> <b>plant</b> and {{produces}} {{enormous amounts of}} pollen (1011 to 1013 pollen grains/ha). Maize pollen is relatively large (80 to 125 μm diameter; 1.25 g/cm 3; approx. 500 μg) and its settling velocity in air is approximately 0.2 m/s. Assuming that the average height of the maize tassel is 2 to 3.5 m above the ground, we can estimate that maize pollen settles {{in the range of}} 20 to 40 m from the field margin on average. However, this assumption would be only true under still air conditions. In the field, still air conditions are practically non-existent. As our data from real environmental conditions (Figure 3) show, maize pollen was deposited even at the farthest distance measured (4.45 km). In fact, considerable amounts of maize pollen drift on the wind over longer distances (> 100 m) and even further than 1, 000 m, with deposition values of 3, 000 to 164, 000 maize pollen grains per square meter (Figure 3). This is consistent with observations of long-distance maize pollen dispersal in other studies [29],[39],[42]. Brunet et al.

Soil nutrient availability, as well as interactions among insect-pollinated plants species, can induce changes in flower and nectar production. However, further investigations are needed to determine the impact of interactions between insect-pollinated species and abiotically pollinated species on such floral traits, especially floral rewards. We carried out a pot experiment in which three insect-pollinated plant species were grown in binary mixtures with four <b>wind-pollinated</b> <b>plant</b> species, differing in their competitive ability. Along the flowering period, we measured floral traits of the insect-pollinated species involved in attractiveness to pollinators (i. e. floral display size, flower size, daily and total 1) flower production, 2) nectar volume, 3) amount of sucrose allocated to nectar). Final plant biomass was measured to quantify competitive interactions. For {{two out of three}} insect-pollinated species, we found that the presence of a wind-pollinated species can negatively impact floral traits involved in attractiveness to pollinators.

40|$|Abstract Since pollen usually travels limited {{distances}} in <b>wind-pollinated</b> <b>plant</b> species, plants {{growing at}} low density may become pollen lim-ited. We examined how local pollen availability and population density affect reproductive suc-cess in two wind-pollinated, dioecious species, Thalictrum fendleri and Thalictrum dioicum. Distance {{to the nearest}} flowering male, the number of flowering males within 2 m, and flower number on those males served as measures of local pollen availability. Increased distance from pollen donors reduced seed set in the lowest-density population of each species, but seed set in high-density populations was not correlated with local pollen availability. For plants in high- and low-density populations at similar distances from pollen donors, this distance only affected seed set in low-density populations. To ensure that dif-ferences in resource availability were not causing spurious correlations between seed set and plant density, we constructed low-density artificial ar-rays in populations of T. dioicum. In these, seed set decreased rapidly with increases in distance from pollen donors. Despite these effects, the density of males in a population was not corre-lated with average seed set in T. dioicum, and hand pollination in the T. dioicum populations also failed to increase seed set over natural levels. These results suggest that pollen receipt only limits seed set on isolated plants within low-density populations of T. dioicum and T. fendleri...|$|E

Airborne ragweed pollen concentrations, measured continuously with a volumetric method are compared with respect to both their quantitative and seasonal aspects. A weekly programmed Hirst spore-trap was used to sample airborne pollen grains, calibrated to handle a flow of 10 L/min of air, which roughly corresponds to a human breathing rhythm. In Timisoara the Lanzoni model was used. The daily quantities of pollen are expressed as numbers of pollen grains per cubic meter of air per day (PG/m 3). The pollen seasons show 3 main parts: tree season (February–April), grass season (May–July), weed season (July–October). In September 65, 71 % of the total aeropollen concentration is due to Ambrosia. The highest concentration of ragweed pollen was 220 PG/m 3.

40|$|A {{long-term}} genetic {{legacy of}} refugial isolation has been postulated and was demonstrated for maternal refugial lineages for numerous {{plant and animal}} species. The lineages were assumed to have remained separated from each other for several glacial periods. The conifer Abies alba Miller, silver fir, is an excellent model to test whether pollen-mediated gene flow may eliminate the genetic imprints of Pleistocene refugial isolation. Two DNA markers with contrasting modes of inheritance were applied to 100 populations covering {{the entire range of}} silver fir in Europe. The markers exhibited each two highly conserved alleles based on an insertion/deletion of 80 bp in the fourth intron of the mitochondrial nad 5 gene and on a synonymous substitution in the chloroplast psbC gene. The geographical distribution of the maternally inherited mitochondrial variation supported the existence of at least two refugia with two recolonizing maternal lineages remaining largely separated throughout the range. The cline of the nad 5 allele frequencies was much steeper than the one of the two psbC alleles. The psbC cline was as wide as the whole range of the species. Our results provide striking evidence that even a species with very long generation times and heavy pollen grains was able to establish a highly efficient pollen-mediated gene flow between refugia.

40|$|Background and Aims The {{frequency}} {{at which}} males {{can be maintained}} with hermaphrodites in androdioecious populations is predicted {{to depend on the}} selfing rate, because self-fertilization by hermaphrodites reduces prospective siring opportunities for males. In particular, high selfing rates by hermaphrodites are expected to exclude males from a population. Here, the first estimates are provided of the mating system from two wild hexaploid populations of the androdioecious European <b>wind-pollinated</b> <b>plant</b> M. annua with contrasting male frequencies. Methods Four diploid microsatellite loci were used to genotype 19 - 20 progeny arrays from two populations of M. annua, one with males and one without. Mating-system parameters were estimated using the program MLTR. Key Results Both populations had similar, intermediate outcrossing rates (t(m) = 0. 64 and 0. 52 for the population with and without males, respectively). The population without males showed a lower level of correlated paternity and biparental inbreeding and higher allelic richness and gene diversity than the population with males. Conclusions The results demonstrate the utility of new diploid microsatellite loci for mating system analysis in a hexaploid plant. It would appear that androdioecious M. annua has a mixed-mating system in the wild, an uncommon finding for wind-pollinated species.

40|$|The {{differential}} plasticity hypothesis {{suggests that}} sexual dimorphism in dioecious plants could evolve {{in response to}} sex-specific resource requirements for reproduction (i. e., high carbon requirements for ovules and high nitrogen demands for pollen). When resources become limiting during growth, males and females should, therefore, adjust their allocation to resource-harvesting organs differently. To investigate the potential for plants to respond to resource limitation late in life and to test the differential plasticity hypothesis, we grew male and female individuals of the annual <b>wind-pollinated</b> <b>plant</b> Mercurialis annua in a common garden. Late in the growth season, we simulated a change in competition by decreasing plant density in half of the replicates. We measured both allocation to vegetative and reproductive traits and analyzed the relative allocation to reproduction vs. growth.

Males maintained the same relative allocation of resource to reproductive vs. vegetative tissues at both densities. In contrast, females reduced vegetative growth proportionally less than seed production at the higher density. Our results highlight the dynamic nature of allocation decisions taken by plants, which respond quickly and in a sexually dimorphic way to changes in their competitive circumstances. The existence of resource 'currencies' limiting male and female functions differently have potentially led to the evolution of sex-specific strategies of resource acquisition and deployment, with females conserving resources for vegetative organs to ensure their future carbon-rich reproduction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Much of {{the current}} {{interest}} in pollen time series analysis is motivated by the possibility that pollen series arise from low-dimensional chaotic systems.

To date, contradictory reports about the character-ization {{of the dynamics of}} pollen series {{can be found in the}} literature. Pollen series have been alternatively described as featuring and not featuring deterministic chaotic behavior. We showed that the choice of test for detection of deter-ministic chaos in pollen series is difficult because pollen series exhibit 1 =f power spectra. This is a characteristic that is also produced by colored noise series, which mimic deterministic chaos in most tests. We proposed to apply the Ikeguchi–Aihara test to properly detect the presence of deterministic chaos in pollen series. We examined the dy-namics of cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) hourly pollen se-ries by means of the Ikeguchi–Aihara test and concluded that these pollen series cannot be described as low-dimen-sional deterministic chaos. Therefore, the application of low-dimensional chaotic deterministic models to the pre-diction of short-range pollen concentration will not result in high-accuracy pollen forecasts even though these mod-els may provide useful forecasts for certain applications. We believe that our conclusion can be generalized to pollen series from other <b>wind-pollinated</b> <b>plant</b> species, as wind speed, the forcing parameter of the pollen emission and transport, is best described as a nondeterministic series that originates in the high dimensionality of the atmosphere...|$|E

Clonal diversity and the {{spatial distribution of}} clones (genets) within populations was investigated in Carex bigelowii (in Iceland and Scandinavia) and C. arenaria (within the species' entire distributional range in W Europe). Both species reproduce mainly by vegetative growth, via rhizomes with long internodes between shoots, and seedling recruitment in established populations is extremely rare or absent. The C. bigelowii populations show high levels of clonal diversity but Ð contrary to predictions based on the extensive clone structure Ð little interdigitation of genets within local patches. Carex arenaria populations are generally multiclonal, but {{there appear to be}} some monoclonal populations in SW Europe. A literature survey of of allozyme data in species of Cyperaceae revealed a strong correlation between clonal growth form and plant breeding system. While caespitose species are generally inbreeding and show little within-population variation, rhizomatous species are outcrossing and have high levels of within population variation. Allozyme investigations of the rhizomatous sedges Carex arenaria, C. bigelowii, C. caryophyllea and C. ericetorum, suggest that these four species are all outbreeders. Carex arenaria, has, however, unusually low overall levels of genetic variation for a rhizomatous sedge. This lack of variation was interpreted in terms of the species' history of glacial survival and postglacial spread. The species-pair C. caryophyllea and C. ericetorum was investigated for ecological amplitude and niche separation in mixed populations in Alvar grassland communities. The two species showed an almost complete overlap in habitat niche, but had partially separate flowering periods. There was a phenological window for pollen transfer from C. caryophyllea to C. ericetorum and allozyme data suggest that there may be gene flow from C. caryophyllea to C. ericetorum...|$|E
40|$|Applied {{mathematics}} {{techniques are}} used in this investigation to gain insight into three different physical processes of current interest in combustion and fluid dynamics. The first problem addresses the propagation of spiral edge flames found in von Karman swirling flows induced in rotating porous-disk burners. In this configuration, a porous disk is spun at a constant angular velocity in an otherwise quiescent oxidizing atmosphere. Gaseous methane is injected through the disk pores and burns in a flat diffusion flame adjacent to the disk. Among other flame patterns experimentally found, a stable, rotating spiral flame is observed for sufficiently large rotation velocities and small fuel flow rates {{as a result of}} partial extinction of the underlying diffusion flame. The tip of the spiral can undergo a steady rotation for sufficiently large rotational velocities or small fuel flow rates, whereas a meandering tip in an epicycloidal trajectory is observed for smaller rotational velocities and larger fuel flow rates. A formulation of this problem is presented in the equidiffusional and thermodiffusive limits within the framework of one-step chemistry with large activation energies. Conditions for extinction of the underlying uniform diffusion flame are obtained by using activation energy asymptotics. Edge-flame propagation regimes are obtained by scaling analyses of the conservation equations and exemplified by numerical simulations of nearly straight two-dimensional edge flames near a cold porous wall in a von Karman boundary layer, for which lateral heat losses to the disk induce extinction of the trailing diffusion flame but are relatively unimportant in the front region, consistent with the existence of the cooling tail found in the experiments. The propagation dynamics of a steadily rotating spiral edge is studied in the large-core limit, for which the characteristic Markstein length is much smaller than the distance from the center at which the spiral tip is anchored. An asymptotic description of the edge tangential structure is obtained, spiral edge shapes are calculated, and an expression is found that relates the spiral rotational velocity {{with the rest of the}} parameters. A quasistatic stability analysis of the edge shows that the edge curvature at extinction in the tip region is responsible for the stable tip anchoring at the core radius. Finally, experimental results are analyzed, and theoretical predictions are tested. The second problem analyzes, in the limit of small Reynolds and ionic Peclet numbers and small clearances, the canonical problem of the forces exerted on a small solid spherical particle undergoing slow translation and rotation in an incompressible fluid moving parallel to an elastic substrate, subject to electric double-layer and van der Waals intermolecular forces, as a representative example of particle gliding and of the idealized swimming dynamics of more complex bodies near soft and sticky surfaces in a physiological solvent. The competition of the hydrodynamic, intermolecular and surface-deformation effects, induces a lift force, and drag-force and drift-force perturbations, which do not scale linearly with the velocities, and produces a non-additivity of the intermolecular effects by reducing the intensity of the repulsive forces and by increasing the intensity of the attractive forces. Reversible and irreversible elastohydrodynamic adhesion regimes are found, and elastohydrodynamic corrections are derived for the critical coagulation concentration of electrolyte predicted by the the Derjaguin-Landau Verwey- Overbeek (DLVO) standard theory of colloid stabilization. The third problem addresses the dynamics of pollen shedding from wind-pollinated plants, and establishes a fluid-dynamical framework for future refinements.

40|$|There {{has been}} a move in the kiwifruit {{industry}} to pollinate by machine, allowing orchardists flexibility in timing, and other advantages. The traditional pollinators, bees, are unreliable and are susceptible to diseases such as the varroa mite. No measurements have been done on the efficiency of single-flower collection of pollen {{and the influence of}} airjet characteristics, to put this activity on a firm quantitative basis. For predictive purposes, a robust model of pollen behaviour around a single Green kiwifruit flower (Actinidia deliciosa) was built in this study by using a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package. The theoretical study first looked at the wind pollination of flower buds at different opening stages. Within the range of draft velocity recorded in the orchards, stigma are predicted to capture more pollen in a wind approaching from the front than from the side and back. Also, the pollen deposition on stigma increases as the bud opens wider and loses its petals. An estimation based on the predicted pollen collection efficiency indicated that wind pollination alone is insufficient to produce a minimum exportable fruit, which is in agreement with the observations reported in the literature. The question whether kiwifruit is a <b>wind-pollinated</b> <b>plant</b> is also discussed. Experimental checks of the modelling were carried out. Visualization of flow paths around a real kiwifruit flower in a wind tunnel compared well with the CFD predictions. The machine pollination employs a jet of air. CFD simulations of pollen-loaded air jets were carried out to study the effect of different jet-nozzle configurations, namely the jet direction onto the flower, nozzle-to-flower distance, diameter of nozzle and initial jet velocity. A frontal spray gives the most efficient pollen delivery to the stigma. Further gain is accomplished by introducing the pollen cloud closer to the flower, from a smaller nozzle and at higher initial jet velocity. These trends, except for that of nozzle size, have been validated experimentally through the pollen spraying of single real kiwifruit flower in the laboratory. Recommended ways of airjet spraying are suggested based on the CFD results. From the stigma collision efficiency, it is more advantageous to apply pollen when most of the flowers have lost their petals. Additional inclusion of an electrostatic influence into the pollen-loaded air jet simulations indicate that corona charging, but not tribo-charging, gives enhanced pollen collection by the stigma. The enhancement depends on the strength of electric field established between the nozzle and the flower. The spraying tests with tribo-charged pollen in laboratory indicated that an improved pollen collection may be possible with a greater charging of pollen. The benefit however was not realized consistently in all experimental conditions. The simulations assumed complete stickiness i. e. complete capture of pollen by the stigma on collision. This study also measured the force necessary to remove pollen in contact with stigma. The stickiness measurements of the stigma of Gold and Green kiwifruit flowers found that both flowers have equally sticky stigma. Stickiness increased with the aging of flowers. A reason is proposed related to the sugar in the exudate film. Overall, the variation of stickiness was statistically insignificant during the day. However, some older stigma were found to be stickier in the afternoon, which is in contrast to the general view that stigma are stickier in the morning. The gain in stickiness by the older stigma supports the recommendations for carrying out machine pollination after the petal fall. The last section of the work was done in an orchard, and studied the characteristics of large jet spraying (without pollen) at the T-bar and pergola trained vines. Recommendations on the designs of jet have been provided...|$|E

For each species mixture, the visits (i. e. first visit, number of visits, 10 -min sequences) of Bombus terrestris individuals released in a flight cage containing two pots were followed, one with and one without below-ground competition. 4. Below-ground competition significantly affected nectar's sucrose concentration but did not influence flower and nectar production. Likewise, pollinator visits were not influenced by below-ground competition. Competitor identity significantly influenced flower and reward production of E. plantagineum, with a decrease {{in the presence of the}} most competitive wind-pollinated species. A tendency for faster flower visitation events was also detected in the presence of the least competitive competitor. This study raises new questions regarding the influence of <b>wind-pollinated</b> <b>plants</b> on plant pollinator interactions...|$|R
40|$|Studies of cycad {{pollination}} globally {{have revealed}} obligate pollination mutualisms with insects, typically hostspecific beetles. Some cycads in the genus Cycas have floating seeds allowing oceanic dispersal, and have colonized remote islands such as Fiji, Guam, and Madagascar. This seems {{to contradict the}} expected requirement that specific beetle pollinators be present in order for cycads to establish in remote localities. We therefore postulated that these ‘island’ cycads are wind pollinated. We tested for adaptations associated with wind pollination in a laboratory study of pollen aerodynamics. The pollen {{from a range of}} (non-cycad) <b>wind-pollinated</b> <b>plants</b> was not relatively ‘buoyant’: the settling velocities of wind-pollinated species exceeded those of insect-pollinated cycads and some animal-pollinated angiosperms. We attributed this result to settling velocity being, in part, correlated with pollen size, as cycad pollen was consistently smaller. A better predictor for pollination vector was the tendency of pollen to aggregate during a vertical fall. Pollen of <b>wind-pollinated</b> <b>plants</b> separated into single grains, whereas cycad pollen and pollen of animal-pollinated angiosperms adhered in large aggregations, the settling velocity of which increased rapidly with aggregate size. The pollen of cycads known to be insect pollinated was similar in morphology, settling speed, and clumping behaviour to pollen of ‘island’ cycads of unknown pollination biology. Based on these aerodynamics, we predict that cycad species on oceanic islands have insect pollinators. More broadly, we propose that pollen aggregation during a vertical fall provides a sound test for wind versus animal pollination when the pollination vector is unknown...|$|R
5000|$|Passerina is a {{generally}} insignificant genus, seldom noticed by the non-botanist. The attractive ericoid habit and fuss-free growth {{make it a}} useful subject in informal fynbos gardens. Being <b>wind-pollinated,</b> the <b>plants</b> generally are not of much importance to pollinating organisms such as bees and birds.|$|R
50|$|Flowers may {{be small}} and inconspicuous, {{as well as}} green and not showy. They produce {{enormous}} numbers of relatively small pollen grains (hence <b>wind-pollinated</b> <b>plants</b> may be allergens, but seldom are animal-pollinated plants allergenic). Their stigmas may be large and feathery to catch the pollen grains. Insects may visit them to collect pollen; in some cases, these are ineffective pollinators and exert little natural selection on the flowers, {{but there are also}} examples of ambophilous flowers which are both wind and insect pollinated.Anemophilous, or wind pollinated flowers, are usually small and inconspicuous, and do not possess a scent or produce nectar. The anthers may produce a large number of pollen grains, while the stamens are generally long and protrude out of flower.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractPollen of <b>{{wind-pollinated}}</b> <b>plants</b> such as grapevine rapidly dries out and {{is blown}} away after the anthers dehisce. Therefore, {{from the point}} of view of a pollen-collecting bee, pollen from wind-pollinated flowers is best collected soon after it becomes exposed. In grapevine, pollen becomes available immediately after the calyptra is shed, a process also referred to as capfall. We show, for the first time, that honey bees foraging on grapevine actively remove the calyptra from flowers. Using manual cap removal, we estimate that cap removal increases the pollen yield by 70  % compared to collecting pollen from flowers after capfall. The bees selectively foraged on inflorescences with high numbers of loose caps, thus further enhancing their pollen revenue. We discuss the possible benefits of cap removal by honey bees for the development of individual berries and grape bunches of certain varieties...|$|R
