2500|$|Grohl's note read, in part, [...] "Though I'm {{halfway around}} the world right now, my heart is with you both, and I {{want you to know that}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home,</b> there's two tickets to any Foos show, anywhere, and two cold beers waiting for you. Deal?" [...] In October 2006, one of the miners took up his offer, joining Grohl for a drink after the Foo Fighters {{acoustic}} concert at the Sydney Opera House. Since then, Foo Fighters have written an instrumental tribute song called [...] "Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners" [...] appearing on the album Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{leave it}} to me," [...] he said. [...] "You {{leave it to}} me, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> from a happy outing I 'ope {{to be able to}} cross your little hand with three 'undred golden quids." ...|$|E
6000|$|Admiration {{shone in}} Margaret Keith's eyes. [...] "It's a great relief, though I knew the worst danger was over <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>home.</b> None of the Challoners ever did so fine a thing, Dick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I wasn't {{there to}} see what you took," [...] said she; [...] "but you were very bad <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> last night;--very bad indeed. You couldn't have got in at the door only for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{last time}} that I saw her like her own old self, was the night <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>home,</b> my dear. The day you went away, she said to me, [...] "I never shall see my pretty darling again. Something tells me so, that tells the truth, I know." ...|$|R
60|$|To {{be tired}} and hungry, however, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> {{at night to}} a Swiss inn, is {{a great source of}} enjoyment--on account of the admirable {{arrangements}} for rest and refreshment which you are sure to find there.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} to bother cooking any dinner for just Davy and myself today," [...] she said. [...] "That cold ham bone will do for noon lunch and I'll have some steak fried for you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> at night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been talkin' {{with the}} other fellers, Paul, an' I want you to let me have the money that come from the theatre. We're thinkin' of doin' somethin' with it, an' <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> to-night we'll {{tell you what it}} is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{good would}} it have done?" [...] asked Nanny, who was little and fair, with rings of light hair that filled a bonnet-front very prettily; she looked best in a bonnet. [...] "It would only have worried you. He could not have stopped Tom; <b>you</b> couldn't, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> to do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|THE GRAND DUCHESS. My poor Strammfest: {{you were}} not often enough at court to tire of it. You were mostly soldiering; and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> {{to have a new}} order pinned on your breast, your {{happiness}} came through looking at my father and mother and at me, and adoring us. Was that not so? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{her best}} friend turned up <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>home,</b> uncle," [...] {{answered}} Rose with an approving pat, adding gratefully, [...] "I can't half {{thank you for being}} so good to my girl, but she will, because I know she {{is going to make a}} woman to be proud of, she's so strong and true, and loving." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And, maybe, Mrs Carbonel and you, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home,</b> {{would be}} good to my poor sister. She've been a good sister to me, she has, with it all, but it has all been against her, and she would be a {{different}} woman if she could. Please remember her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Margaret, no," [...] {{said the}} mother. [...] "I couldn't {{go to my}} bed without coming to see Avis's grave. I brought her up from a baby--her dying mother gave her to me. She was as much my own child as any of you. And oh! I miss her so. You only miss her <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home,</b> but I miss her all the time--every day!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, {{you will}} come. I will call in if I may, and chat {{it over with}} you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home.</b> We have not breakfasted yet. Goodbye!" [...] There was a whir of wheels, and the yellow cloud rolled away down the road again. By some legerdemain the Admiral {{found that he was}} {{clutching}} in his right hand one of the obnoxious bills. He crumpled it up, and threw it into the roadway.|$|E
3000|$|Context: You {{and your}} friend {{agreed to meet}} at 41  St.’s 7 - 11, but you didn’t see him at the {{appointed}} time. The 7 - 11 clerk told you there’s another 7 - 11 on 41  St. so you hastened to go there but still didn’t find him. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>home,</b> <b>you</b> got his call. He says, ‘Why didn't you wait for me? I was only 15  minutes late!’ You reply: [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't <b>you</b> remember, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> {{after your}} wound, you said I--I mustn't--' {{and she fell}} into such a {{paroxysm}} of crying that he had quite to hold her up in his arms, and though his voice was merry, there was a moisture on his eyelashes. 'Oh, you Polly! You're a caution against deluding the infant mind! Was that all? Was that what made you distract them all? Why not have said so?' ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY CICELY. No: SHE'D {{know you}} mean well. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> and said, [...] "Mary: I've just told {{all the world}} that your {{sister-in-law}} was a police court criminal, and that I sent her to prison; and your nephew is a brigand, and I'm sending HIM to prison." [...] she'd have thought it must be all right because you did it. But you don't {{think she would have}} LIKED it, any more than papa and the rest of us, do you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My child," [...] said he, [...] "I {{want you}} to go. Of course, I did not take to the notion at first, but I did not {{consider}} then what {{you will have to}} tell <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home.</b> The people of Glenford will be your everlasting debtors. It might be a good thing to invite Maria Port out here. You could give her the best time she ever had in her life, telling her about the Broadstone people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I do {{wish you}} would! It isn't that I care, but honestly, George, {{it is so}} bad for you to smoke so much. Don't {{you think you could}} reduce the amount? And George--I notice now, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> from these lodges and all, that {{sometimes}} you smell of whisky. Dearie, you know I don't worry so much about the moral side of it, but you have a weak stomach and you can't stand all this drinking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, if {{you manage}} it properly, {{it will be}} the best day's work you have ever done. Get out of the house before she wakes. I shall say nothing to her. Indeed, I shall not have the time; I must catch the ten o'clock from Paddington. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> this evening, you talk first; that's what you've got to do." [...] And Mr. Korner, in his excitement, kissed the bosom friend before he knew what he had done.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{father and}} I have been alone all day long. Not {{that it is}} so {{uncommon}} for Lise to be gone. I wish it wasn't! But <b>you!</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> didn't <b>come</b> <b>home</b> for supper I was considerably worried." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Well, gentlemen,’ said Mrs. Parsons, ‘you {{are really}} very polite; you stay away the whole morning, after {{promising}} {{to take us}} out, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do <b>come</b> <b>home,</b> <b>you</b> stand whispering together and take no notice of us.’ ...|$|R
5000|$|Sokol {{describes}} his mother as traditional and loving. Even though their home was modest, {{she made it}} comfortable and welcoming. [...] "She {{was the kind of}} mother who had cookies warm out of the oven <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> from school," [...] says Sokol. [...] "She focused on our care and education." [...] Sokol's parents {{would not be able to}} pay for their children's college education, but it was expected that each of them would go. [...] "My father expected us to work our way through school, but he didn't think that was a bad thing. He believed you learned a lot from working." ...|$|R
60|$|If {{you leave}} {{the key in the}} door for convenience' sake, they will carry it down to the office and give it to the clerk. They do this under the vile pretense of trying to protect your {{property}} from thieves; but actually they do it because they want to make you tramp back down-stairs after it <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> tired, or put you to the trouble of sending a waiter for it, which waiter will expect you to pay him something. In which case I suppose the degraded creatures divide.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel the}} same, Hugh; {{but you would}} not find it so, I think, if you had come home for good. Then you would have your regular pursuits on the farm, while now you have simply got tired of having no work to do. When the war is over, and we have done soldiering, you will settle {{down on one of}} the farms of the Chace. Madame says you shall have the first that falls vacant <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home.</b> Then you will take a wife, and be well content that you have seen the world, and have {{something}} to look back upon beyond a six miles circuit of Derby." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I would,--only drudge don't sound well. Call her a ministering angel instead, and {{it comes}} to the same thing. They both of 'em means much of a muchness;--getting up your linen decent, and seeing that you have a bit of {{something}} hot <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> late. Well, good-night, old fellow. I shall have my hair combed if I stay much longer. Take my advice, and as you mean to do it, do it at once. And don't let the old 'un nobble all the money. Live and let live. That's fair play all over." [...] And so Mr. Poppins took his leave.|$|E
6000|$|... "By George, {{she always}} does. If there's {{anything}} wrong it's been with Hugh; and, by George, I don't {{know what it}} is he was up to <b>when</b> <b>you</b> first <b>came</b> <b>home.</b> It wasn't my doing--of course you know that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did think}} that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> we might crawl there {{together}} some warm morning. I did {{think of that}} for a time. But {{it will never be}} so, dear. I shall never see anything now that I do not see from here,--and not that for long. Do not cry, Nelly. I have nothing to regret, nothing to make me unhappy. I know how poor and weak has been my life; but I know how rich and strong is that other life. Do not cry, Nelly,--not till I am gone; and then not beyond measure. Why should any one weep for those who go away full of years,--and full of hope?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Flinging {{the salt}} from their wings, and despair from their hearts [...] They arise on the breast {{of the storm}} with a cry and are gone.

Only death in his reaping could make you return no more.|$|R
6000|$|A {{man with}} a {{reflective}} turn of mind, walking through an exhibition of this sort, will not be oppressed, I take it, by his own or other people's hilarity. [...] An episode of humour or kindness touches and amuses him here and there--a pretty child looking at a gingerbread stall; a pretty girl blushing whilst her lover talks to her and chooses her fairing; poor Tom Fool, yonder behind the waggon, mumbling his bone with the honest family which lives by his tumbling; but the general impression is one more melancholy than mirthful. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> you sit down in a sober, contemplative, not uncharitable frame of mind, and apply yourself to your books or your business.|$|E
6000|$|Wise. So it is. Therefore, when God would shew {{the greatness}} of his anger against sin and sinners in one word, he saith, They are joyned to Idols, let them alone. {173b} Let them alone, that is, disturb them not; let them goe on without controll; let the Devil enjoy them peaceably, let him carry {{them out of the}} world {{unconverted}} quietly. This is one of the sorest of Judgments, and bespeaketh the burning anger of God against sinfull men. See also <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>home,</b> the fourteenth Verse of the Chapter last mentioned in the Margent: I will not punish your daughters when they commit Whoredom.

60|$|ASHER. I'll tell <b>you,</b> George. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> this {{afternoon}} I realized something I hadn't realized before. I {{saw that the}} tide was against me, that I was like that old English king who set his throne on the sands and thought he could stay the waters. If--if anything had happened to you, I couldn't have fought on, but now that you're here with me again, now that you've risked your life and almost lost it for this--this new order in which you believe, why, it's enough for me--I can surrender with honour. I'm tired, I need a rest. I'd have gone down fighting, but I guess you've saved me. I've been true to my convictions,--you, who belong to the new generation, must be true to yours. And as I told you once, all I care about this business is to hand it over to you.|$|R
