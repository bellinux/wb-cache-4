5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Driven by an Enlightenment belief in progress, she derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family has a farm sufficient for its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with <b>what</b> <b>she</b> claims is genuine feeling, with Burke's false theatrical tableaux.|$|E
5|$|After a {{video call}} with Lydia, Alice {{inadvertently}} opens the video with the suicide instructions.

5|$|Amanita australis is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Amanitaceae. It is found only in New Zealand, where it occurs in Leptospermum and Nothofagus forest. The species was first {{described}} by New Zealand mycologist Greta Stevenson in 1962; in the same publication Stevenson also described <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thought was a unique species, Limacella macrospora, but over 30 years later this was reduced to synonymy with A.australis.|$|E

5|$|Born in Chicago, Illinois, Piccard {{was one of}} nine {{children}} born to Emily Ridlon and John Ridlon, who {{was president of the}} American Orthopaedic Association. She had a lifelong interest in science and religion. When she was 11, her mother asked her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted to be when she grew up. Piccard's reply"a priest"sent her mother running out of the room in tears.|$|E
5|$|Gaga grounds {{this sort}} of {{spectacle}} with her voice. She is still a fearsome singer when she chooses to be, {{which is to say}} rarely on records but often in concert... <b>What</b> <b>she</b> gave the faithful was easy to digest: largely bulletproof pop, swinging back and forth between brooding, panting torch songs delivered at top volume and grand-scale 1980s-style digital rock with a nightclub twist.|$|E

5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers, she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She argues for rationality, pointing out that Burke's system {{would lead to the}} continuation of slavery, simply because it had been an ancestral tradition. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with <b>what</b> <b>she</b> says is genuine feeling, to Burke's false feeling.|$|E

5|$|Sarah {{was famous}} for telling the Queen exactly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thought, and did not offer her flattery. Anne and Sarah had invented petnames for {{themselves}} during their youths which they continued to use after Anne became queen: Mrs Freeman (Sarah) and Mrs Morley (Anne). Effectively a business manager, Sarah had control over the Queen's position, from her finances to people admitted to the royal presence.|$|E

5|$|She was {{sensible}} how arduous a task it is {{to produce}} a truly excellent novel; and she roused her faculties to grapple with it. All her other works were produced with a rapidity, that did not give her powers time fully to expand. But this was written slowly and with mature consideration. She began it in several forms, which she successively rejected, after they were considerably advanced. She wrote {{many parts of the}} work again and again, and, when she had finished <b>what</b> <b>she</b> intended for the first part, she felt herself more urgently stimulated to revise and improve <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had written, than to proceed, with constancy of application, in the parts that were to follow.|$|E
5|$|A second joint {{appearance}} {{took place}} in Beverly Hills. According to Nixon campaign adviser Bill Arnold, Douglas arrived late, while Nixon was already speaking. Nixon ostentatiously looked at his watch, provoking laughter from the audience. The laughter recurred as Nixon, sitting behind Douglas as she spoke, fidgeted to indicate his disapproval of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was saying; she appeared bewildered at the laughter. Douglas concluded her remarks and Nixon rose to speak again, {{but she did not}} stay to listen.|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} a bridge, {{they reached the}} gardens {{in front of the}} palace, and Moberly noticed a lady sketching on the grass who looked at them. She later described <b>what</b> <b>she</b> saw in great detail: the lady was wearing a light summer dress, on her head was a shady white hat, and she had lots of fair hair. Moberly thought she was a tourist at first, but the dress appeared to be old-fashioned. Moberly came to believe that the lady was Marie Antoinette. Jourdain, however, did not see the lady.|$|E
5|$|Although she {{was never}} {{successful}} in her {{more than a decade}} of legal pursuits for recompense from the United States government for seized land, in 1911 she was finally granted a $1,250 a month lifetime pension by the Territory of Hawaii. Historian Sydney Lehua Iaukea noted that besides being a greatly reduced figure from <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had asked for recompense, it also never addressed the question of the legality of the seizure itself.|$|E
