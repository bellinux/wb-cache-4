But if there is {{evidence}} that some individuals and, in some cases, entire groups are alienated from mainstream society, there should be detailed research into the effect that this has on society as a whole (see normlessness). In such research, Marxism tends to focus on societal forces rather than the motives of individuals and their dualistic capacity for both right and wrong, moral and immoral. This can lead to a less comprehensive explanation of <b>why</b> <b>people</b> <b>exercise</b> their autonomy by choosing to act in particular ways. By comparison, in the sociology of deviance, Robert K. Merton borrows Durkheim's concept of anomie to form the Strain Theory. Merton argues that the real problem of alienation is not created by a sudden social change, as Durkheim proposed, but rather by a social structure that holds out the same goals to all its members without giving them equal means to achieve them. It is this lack of integration between what the culture calls for and what the structure permits that causes deviant behaviour. Deviance then is a symptom of the social structure. Taylor et al. intend a combination of Interactionism and Marxism as a radical alternative to previous theories to formulate a [...] "fully social theory of deviance". [...] The power to label behaviour as [...] "deviant" [...] arises partly from the unequal distribution of power within the state, and because the judgment carries the authority of the state, it attributes greater stigma to the prohibited behaviour. This is true no matter what the political orientation of the state. All states enact laws which, {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, protect property. This may take the form of theft, or prohibit damage or trespass. Even though a theft law may not appear judgmental, a Marxist analysis of the conviction rates may detect inequalities in the way in which the law is applied. Thus, the decision whether to prosecute or to convict may be skewed by having the resources to employ a good lawyer. The same analysis may also show that the distribution of punishment for any given crime may vary according to the social class of the perpetrator. But, the law of theft exists to protect the interests of all those who own property. It does not discriminate by reference to the class of the owner. Indeed, few laws in any states are drafted to protect property interests by reference to class, and the acceptance and enforcement of laws generally depend on a consensus within the community that such laws meet local needs. In this, a comparison of the crime rates between states shows little correlation by reference to political orientation. Such correlations as do exist tend to reflect disparities between rich and poor, and features describing the development of the social and economic environment. Hence, the crimes rates are comparable in states where there are the largest disparities of wealth distribution, regardless of whether they are first, second or third world.|$|E

Even though we know that exercise is good, motivation is required to get started. The big challenge is how to build asustainable motivation. The overall aim of this study was therefore to study motivating factors that are important related to exercise and work out, among the members on training center IKSU. The purpose was also to study why the members choose IKSU. This was answered by collecting quantitative data by a survey that was posted on IKSU:s Facebook page. The results showed that the main motives for exercise is to strive for good physical shape and well-beeing. The reason why members choose IKSU is because they offer various training opportunities and have competent training instructors. The conclusion drawn was that intrinsic motivation was the main motive <b>why</b> <b>people</b> <b>exercise</b> at IKSU...|$|E
40|$|Regular {{exercise}} {{has been}} identified as being important to an individual's social, physical and psychological well being (Dishman, 1994). Yet very few <b>people</b> <b>exercise</b> to levels sufficient to accrue these benefits. Researchers have begun to develop an understanding of <b>why</b> some <b>people</b> <b>exercise</b> whilst others do not, but much of this research has focused upon non-disabled people, whilst very little is known about disabled people. This research sought to investigate the 'Interactions between Disability and Exercise'. The main aims of this investigation were to first examine the exercise intentions of disabled individual's (wheelchair users) using the Social Model ofDisability (Oliver, 1996), to act as a framework. Secondly, to determine the factors, which underpin intentions to exercise, attitude toward exercise, influence of significant others, choices and self-determination. Critical Social Research (Harvey, 1990), is the process which, is adopted throughout the research in order to examine underpinning factors, which could influence a disabled person's decision whether or not to participate in exercIse...|$|R
40|$|We re-examine the {{sequential}} search problem where sellers {{search for}} the best price from a known distribution. Existing theory predicts the optimal strategy to be a unique constant reservation price. However, experimental evidence to date has found that people generally "search too little " compared to the theoretical benchmarks. We argue the behavioral anomaly is an artifact of the truncated information structure of the sequential search problem that gives rise to asymmetric regret and rejoicing. Embedding the problem within a behavioral model incorporating both anticipated regret and rejoicing based on the regret theory of Loomes & Sugden (1982) and Bell (1982), we …nd: First, people search too little {{if and only if}} they are more sensitive to regret than to rejoicing. Second, if we revise the feedback structure of the search problem so that people expect to see what the price would have been had they continued to search (after they stop), search behaviors become observationally indistinguishable from the benchmarks. Moreover, these results are found to hold even when the price distribution becomes unknown. By building a dynamic structure between anticipated regret/rejoicing and experienced regret/rejoicing, our model explains <b>why</b> <b>people</b> sometimes <b>exercise</b> recall. An empirica...|$|R
40|$|This article {{contributes}} to debates about agency (meaning the behaviour of individuals) and structure, by drawing on empirical research into personal debt. Consideration of debt allows for debate about agency and structure beyond the narrow confines of welfare, {{and for the}} examination of agency in relation to citizens {{at different points in}} the broader socio-economic structure, not solely poor people. Based on the research findings, themselves grounded in interviewees' experience, the question of <b>why</b> two <b>people</b> in the same material circumstances will have different experiences becomes reframed as <b>why</b> two <b>people</b> whose <b>exercise</b> of agency is the same, face very different outcomes? It is argued that while the research supports a ‘both-and’ rather than ‘either-or’ approach to understanding agency and structure, a ‘both-and’ approach still does not fully capture the experience of interviewees. The key point is that the exercise of agency is overlaid onto structural inequality, and it is understanding the exercise of ‘agency within structure’ that is critical...|$|R

40|$|Management {{scholars}} have long separated {{the study of}} opportunity creation and discovery, assuming {{that the nature of}} opportunities itself is not affected by information acquisition. Research on judgment and decision-making challenges this assumption, confirming that we judge the nature of opportunities in large part by the way we acquire information about it. Management theorists have yet to digest this evidence because of a cue-based view of the opportunity-exploitation relation (i. e., people act on independent opportunity cues), which conceals the effortful acquisition of information (i. e., the formation of the business idea). I build an alternative process view that accommodates available evidence by theorizing business ideas—a reversion to Schumpeter (1912) —to capture the way we acquire information, including pattern recognition and cognitive depletion, as it yields powerful explanations for entrepreneurial dynamics. Schumpeter’s theory elucidates <b>why</b> some <b>people</b> <b>exercise</b> a business idea and leap into entrepreneurship yet others do not; it also explains why entrepreneurship entry is rare, even though opportunities may be prevalent. This article thus contributes to management knowledge by redefining the current division of scholarly labor as a consequential theoretical problem and developing the requisite theoretical tools to redress that problem. Through business ideas, I theorize information acquisition and its relation to entrepreneurial dynamics in a way that fosters the sustainable integration of opportunity creation and discovery in the process view of entrepreneurship entry in management studies...|$|R
40|$|Health {{concerns}} {{associated with}} obesity are becoming an increasingly large societal problem. Engaging in physical exercise is one {{effective way to}} combat obesity, but most <b>people</b> do not <b>exercise</b> enough to derive significant health benefits. In order to increase participation in exercise activities, {{it is first necessary}} to have a good understanding of <b>why</b> <b>people</b> are not <b>exercising.</b> The current research builds on prior research by investigating the proposition that conflict from work, family, and school roles can reduce time spent exercising. To accomplish this goal, I created exercise conflict scales by taking existing items from the work-family conflict literature and modifying them to reflect the extent to which time-based and strain-based role conflict from each domain (work, family, and school) interferes with exercise. The new exercise conflict scales were investigated alongside several constructs (i. e., personality, exercise automaticity, exercise intentions, perceived benefits and barriers) that have been demonstrated to correlate with exercise. I anticipated that all types of exercise conflict would be negatively related to exercise, and would moderate the relationship between the other predictors and exercise. Results indicated that all types of exercise conflict were negatively related to exercise as expected. Further, exercise conflict, as well as perceived barriers, exhibited numerous moderating effects. In the future, the exercise conflict scales could potentially be used in exercise interventions in order to help organizations increase exercise participation by providing more targeted (i. e., domain specific) interventions...|$|R

This research finds that more personal means of communicating (i. e., face-to-face canvassing) are more motivating than less personal ones (i. e., telephone calls).
