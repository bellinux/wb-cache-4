25|$|It's really {{difficult}} {{for a person to}} create their own life and their own freedom. It's going to become more and more difficult, and it's going to create more and more disillusioned people who become dishonest and angry and are willing to fuck the next guy to get what they want. There's so much stepping on the backs of other people in our profession. We've been so lucky that we've never had to do that. Part of it was because of our own tenacity, and part of it was because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{script was}} given to Maurice Hurley to rewrite. He took six weeks for the rewrite, and his initial version was {{received}} poorly by TNG executives. Hurley later said, [...] "they absolutely hated it, I think they wanted to fire me, {{and they would have}} if I didn't have a guaranteed contract". He rewrote the script, and this version was filmed. Hurley was pleased with the result, saying that [...] "everything about that episode worked". The final version differed significantly from the original Reaves-Duane script; Duane later said that only two scenes remained: where Picard sees his mother, and where he nearly falls out of the turbolift into space. Reaves later said that the episode [...] "came together much better on the screen than we thought it would when we read the script. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky,</b> because it was out of our hands".|$|E
500|$|Carpenter and {{his crew}} persuaded the city to shut off the {{electricity}} to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. [...] "We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending {{on whether or not}} we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for {{about two and a half}} months I never saw daylight, which was really strange." [...] The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, [...] "That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [...] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape." [...] In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system. In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. [...] "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky.</b> It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble".|$|E

If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>we</b> understand the project when it is built, but sometimes we still cannot grasp its meaning. We can communicate with clients and contractors (of course) but we do that in the language which everybody understands.|$|R

"We {{were treated}} just like dogs. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> {{to get paid}} the 50 quid a month we were due, and we lived in tin humpies you had to crawl in and out on your knees. There was no running water. The food was bad – just flour, tea, sugar and bits of beef like the head or feet of a bullock. The Vesteys mob were hard men. They didn't care about blackfellas." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul Royle, a Bristol Blenheim pilot, {{was interviewed}} in March 2014 {{as part of}} the 70th anniversary of the escape, living in Perth, Australia at the age of 100. He downplayed the {{significance}} of the escape and did not claim that he did anything extraordinary, saying: [...] "While we all hoped for the future <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> to get the future. We eventually defeated the Germans and that was that." [...] Royle died, aged 101, in August 2015.|$|E
2500|$|In 1884, matters {{got worse}} for the Wolverines, as they {{finished}} in last place with a 28-84 record. Bennett's batting average fell to [...]264, but his on-base percentage remained high at [...]334, and his WAR rating remained strong at 4.1. [...] Bennett later recalled the toll of multiple losing seasons in Detroit: [...] "During {{the next four years}} [...] I wished many times I was out of Detroit, or, rather, out of that team. [...] It was awful. [...] I thought sometimes <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> to finish last. [...] Once we lost twenty-five straight games. [...] Every week I caught a new pitcher." ...|$|E

2500|$|Australia's first Test of the 1996 Tour to Europe against Italy marked David Campese's 100th {{international}} Test. He {{became the}} second person, after French centre Philippe Sella, {{to achieve the}} milestone. The Test took place two days after Campese's 34th birthday in Padova, where Campese had played rugby in Italy for three years from 1984 to 1986. The Test took place close to his father's birthplace, Vicenza. In Campo: Still Entertaining Campese recalls that, [...] "Unfortunately, they were not treated to vintage performances, by myself or {{the rest of the}} Wallabies. The Italians got stuck into us and, in some respects, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> to get away with a 40-18 scoreline." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon landing, {{the crew}} {{were unable to}} shut down the No.1 engine, which had to be doused by {{emergency}} crews for three hours after landing until flameout was achieved. The pilots considered whether to evacuate the plane immediately after landing as fuel was leaking from the left wing onto the brakes, which were extremely hot from maximum braking. The SCC pilot, David Evans, noted in an interview, [...] "We’ve got a situation where there is fuel, hot brakes and an engine that we can’t shut down. And really the safest place was on board the aircraft until such time as things changed. So we had the cabin crew with an alert phase the whole time through ready to evacuate, open doors, inflate slides at any moment. As time went by, that danger abated and, thankfully, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> enough to get everybody off very calmly and very methodically through one set of stairs." [...] The plane was on battery power and had to contend with only one VHF radio to coordinate emergency procedure with the local fire crew.|$|E
2500|$|After the game, Coach Kipke told reporters: [...] "We got off easy[...] [...] [...] [...] Minnesota {{has a great}} {{football}} team, and it is {{only fair}} to say <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> to hold them scoreless[...] [...] [...] [...] Our offense probably would have looked better on a dry field. [...] Everhadus is our only hard driving back, while Minnesota has three, [...] [...] [...] Our other ball carriers depend on sidestepping to go places and they couldn't do much of that with the footing so slippery." [...] Kipke also praised his defense for their play after Minnesota drove to the 15-yard line: [...] "Fourth down and 12 yards to go didn't look bad at all. [...] Renner certainly meant business when he threw Alfonse for that six-yard loss." [...] The Wolverines played a defensive oriented game and relied heavily on Regeczi's punting. [...] One sports columnist wrote: [...] "No game I have seen this season more clearly brought out the inestimable value of consistent punting as did this bruise and batter struggle [...] [...] [...] [...] No matter where Michigan was located when Johnny Regeczi went back to kick, the boot almost always was good enough to place Minnesota on the defensive." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pyarelal of the Laxmikant-Pyarelal duo {{quoted in}} an {{interview}} that [...] "Rajesh Khanna was lucky for us and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>lucky</b> for him too. From the 1969 Do Raaste to the 1986 Amrit, we gave hits together both as films and as music scores.... When we went on our first overseas concert tour in 1984, he came and danced to three songs. He was very particular about his music and would take a tape home if he could not assess a song. He would then give his feedback after a day or two. But if he liked a song at the sitting, he would loudly shout [...] "Wah! Wah!" [...] in appreciation…. It was God’s blessing that we came up with such a vast range of hit songs for him, including in his home productions Roti and films like Chhailla Babu, Chakravyuha, Fiffty Fiffty, Amar Deep and Anurodh. Incidentally, he had a stake in Mehboob Ki Mehndi too. He had great interest in music and a terrific sense of melody too. His music is dominated by Pancham (R.D. Burman) and us and we accepted Shakti Samanta’s Anurodh only because Rajesh Khanna had some misunderstanding with Pancham then, {{and did not want to}} work with him." [...] Khanna would always request music directors to fit in Kishore Kumar wherever possible. In fact, Kishore was very reluctant to sing [...] "Waada Tera Waada" [...] in Dushman and suggested to Laxmikant-Pyarelal to get it sung by Rafi. Then Laxmikant made Kishore meet Rajesh Khanna and Khanna winked at Laxmikant and told Kishore that in that case the song should be scrapped. On hearing this, Kishore immediately agreed to sing it by himself for Khanna.|$|E
