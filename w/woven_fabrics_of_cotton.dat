40|$|<b>Woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> <b>of</b> <b>cotton,</b> on {{the warp}} threads are coated with an {{adhesive}} sizing agent {{to prevent the}} threads from breaking during weaving process. Starch and its derivatives {{are the most common}} sizing agents. After weaving, starch must be removed in order to prepare the fabric for dyeing and finishing. This process is called as desizing and it include the use of chemicals such as acids, alkalis and oxidising agents with traditional process. Because of that in the world are carried out investigations to replace conventional chemical textile processes by eco-friendly and economically attractive bioprocesses using enzymes. This paper will show the experimental results relating to the selection of the enzyme and process optimization made in order to increase the content of glucose in the desizing liquor of starch sized cotton fabric. The results showed that the commercial desizing enzyme preparations of α-amylase enzymes were not appropriate to produce a large quantity of glucose, and whilst used commercial food amyloglucosidase preparation, produced a large quantity of glucose after the optimization process...|$|E
30|$|Plain, twill and satin <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> <b>of</b> <b>cotton,</b> {{polyester}} and polyester-cotton of 150  g/m 2 and 200  g/m 2 {{have been}} used to study their suitability for surgical gowns before and after application of flouropolymer and antibacterial finishes. Different concentration levels of fluoropolymer and antibacterial finishes were used to find the level of finishes required for different AAMI protection levels along with their durability using standard laundering cycles. It is observed that all the fabrics except 150  g/m 2 cotton fabric, can be used for AAMI protection level 1 only without any finish. The water repellence of fabrics increases on application of fluoropolymer finish. 4 % fluoropolymer finish on these fabrics {{can be used to make}} them suitable for AAMI protection level 2. Increasing fluropolymer concentration level further increases the hydrostatic pressure but does not make them suitable for protection level 3 and therefore are not recommended for critical areas of the surgical gown. Twill woven fabrics of 200  g/m 2 show highest hydrostatic pressure, but higher stiffness and low air permeability make them quite uncomfortable for longer duration usage. Satin fabrics are more comfortable offering higher air permeability and lower stiffness, but show lowest hydrostatic pressure values and therefore offer minimal water repellence. Repeated laundering cycles lead to reduction in the barrier resistance of fabrics. It is observed that 150  g/m 2 polyester and twill woven 200  g/m 2 cotton fabrics with 4 % fluoropolymer finish maintain their AAMI protection level 2 upto 20 washing cycles. Satin woven fabrics treated with 4 % fluoropolymer finish can maintain AAMI protection level 2 upto 5 washing cycles only. 1.5 % antibacterial finish is sufficient to inhibit the growth of S. aureus bacteria for all fabric samples and this antibacterial activity is maintained upto 20 washing cycles for all fabrics.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to control if the steam ironing effect applied on cotton {{clothing}} can persist in different climatic conditions. For this purpose, the effect of steam ironing process on the sorption isotherms <b>of</b> plain <b>weave</b> <b>fabrics</b> made <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> was investigated. An experimental device conceived around a magnetic suspension balance was used to regulate temperature at two levels (25 degrees C and 35 degrees C). Using the same proportions of mixed air, relative humidities can reach fixed values between 3 % and 97 %. Two successive cycles of continuous adsorption/desorption water vapor were used. The sorption isotherms of the ironed and non-ironed fabrics are compared. They define three sorption zones depending on the nature of links between structure and water vapor. The results show that the adsorption isotherm <b>of</b> the ironed <b>fabrics</b> is lower than the non-ironed one during the initial two zones of the sigmoid. Then, they are superposed in the last sector of the adsorption isotherm and during the entire desorption phase. Therefore, the ironing can reduce the sorption capacity <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> at low and moderate relative humidities. A second adsorption/desorption cycle is performed on the same samples to prove that the ironing effect is completely cancelled...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} changes of ability of hemp fibre {{nonwovens}} to absorb water after {{deposition of metal}} and metal oxide nanoparticles were investigated.

Analysis of measurements showed that nonwoven samples with surface treated in plasma attract water slightly better than sample with untreated surface; this was more pronounced in <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> samples. In turn, metal coatings reduced water sorption. Unlike <b>woven</b> <b>fabric</b> samples, nonwoven samples attract similar water quantity irrespectively of surface modification.
