25|$|Another species {{commonly}} {{confused with}} the <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> <b>aster</b> is Schreber's aster (Eurybia schreberi). Schreber's aster is typically found on moister soils, though {{it can also be}} found on mesic sites. While much of their ranges overlap, Schreber's aster is not found south of Virginia or Tennessee. Schreber's aster can also be distinguished by the more numerous teeth on the leaves, typically numbering 15 to 30 per side to the white wood aster's 6 to 15 per side. The leaves are wider on Schreber's aster with broader sinuses at the bases.

25|$|Eurybia divaricata (formerly Aster divaricatus), {{commonly}} known as the <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> <b>aster,</b> is an herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It occurs in the eastern United States, primarily in the Appalachian mountains, though it is also present in southeastern Canada, but only in about 25 populations in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. In the U.S. it is abundant and common, but in Canada it is considered threatened due to its restricted distribution. It can be found in dry open woods as well as along wood-edges and clearings. The species is distinguished by its flower heads that have yellow centers and white rays that are arranged in flat-topped corymbiform arrays, emerging in the late summer through fall. Other distinguishing characteristics include its serpentine stems and sharply serrated narrow heart-shaped leaves. The <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> <b>aster</b> is sometimes used in cultivation in both North America and Europe due to it being quite tough and for its showy flowers.|$|E
25|$|Several {{different}} {{plants are}} superficially {{quite similar to}} the <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> <b>aster,</b> but close examination as well as knowledge of the plants' differing habitats and ranges can readily distinguish them. The most similar species is the mountain wood aster (Eurybia chlorolepis), which was previously considered conspecfic with E. divaricata. E. chlorolepis differs in having flower stalks that are longer than 1.5cm, while those of E. divaricata are shorter than this. The involucres of the mountain wood aster are generally between 6.5 and 9mm in length, while those of the <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> <b>aster</b> are normally from 4.2 to 6.5mm long, but in rare cases they may be as long as 7.5mm. The mountain wood aster almost always has more rays than the white wood aster: the former usually has 12 to 16, but occasionally as few as 10, while the latter generally has 5 to 10 and never more than 12. The rays are also longer on the mountain wood aster at 17 to 18mm in most cases, while the white wood aster's are generally only 10 to 15mm. Lastly, E. chlorolepsis is present only from southern Virginia south to Georgia in the Appalachian Mountains at altitudes of , while E. divaricata can be found from southern Canada south to Alabama, meaning their ranges only overlap in the southern United States, and there only at high elevations.|$|E

40|$|This {{study focused}} on removal of color, COD, and lignin in {{wastewater}} of pulp and paper mill using <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> ash and black wood ash that generated from boilers unit in the pulp and paper mill. Batch experiments were setup for studying the equilibrium time, pH, quantity of wood ash and adsorption isotherm. The results from the equilibrium time experiment concluded that the equilibrium time of the <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> ash is much more rapid than the black wood ash indicated as 2 minutes and 25 minutes, respectively. The effect of pH on the removal of such studied parameters was different for the <b>white</b> and black <b>wood</b> ash. Variation in pH of wastewater at the levels of 2 to 10 had no influence in removal of color (89 - 93 %), COD (66 - 70 %) and lignin (78 - 82 %) when <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> ash was used, whereas the effect of pH on the removal was evident when using black wood ash. The highest removal of color (42. 2 %), lignin (31. 1 %) and COD (29. 7 %) was found when the initial pH was adjusted to 2 and such removal was gradually decreased when pH was raised. The optimum dose of <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> ash for the highest removal efficiency was 20 g ash /L of wastewater. This amount of wood ash can remove color 95 %, lignin 80 % and COD 69 %. The reason for high removal efficiency of <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> ash might occur from the precipitation of lignin by CaO which is the major component of the ash. For the black wood ash, the optimum dose was calculated from the isotherm equation of adsorption, both by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm. These isotherms were applicable to color and lignin, while they were inapplicable to COD. The isotherm for adsorption of color and lignin indicate that the removal mechanism by black wood ash {{was likely to be}} physical adsorption. The results indicated that the <b>white</b> <b>wood</b> ash was better than the black wood ash in treating the pulp and paper wastewater...|$|R
