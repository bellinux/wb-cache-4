The signal is then immediately amplified to remove the danger of contamination by signal noise, and then a compensation of the 6 dB/oct slope is done by derivator element on the programming pins of an NE592 video amplifier. A surprisingly flat characteristic is obtained. If the PIN diode is equipped with 3 kΩ working resistor to operate in flat band mode, the range is reduced to about 30% due to thermal noise from the 3 kΩ resistor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Author: Bc. Jan Lipták Title: Review of the {{possibility}} of the use of the stone veneer for constructional materials sheathing The aim of the diploma thesis was to review whether the stone veneer is suitable or comparable material for sheathing constructional materials. The beech veneer was used for the comparison. Firstly, the history of the veneers and the decorative veneers manufacturing are described in the theoretical part. Then it is focused on the stone treatment, its history and the manufacturing of the stone veneer. The next part of the thesis deals with the methods of the stone and beech veneer testing: bending strength tests, glue strength tests, humidity and density assessing and tests of the surface <b>working</b> <b>resistance</b> to a falling small ball. Further, results of measurements are presented in form of tables and graphs. The results proved that the stone veneer is comparable to the beech veneer that reached better results in bending strength. The stone veneer is better in the glue strength. The density tests pointed out the higher density of the stone veneer. The humidity is influenced by the density and the stone veneer samples were of lower humidity. The tests of the surface <b>working</b> <b>resistance</b> to a falling small ball did not recorded notable differences, the degree of the damage was assessed to be of the level 4.

30|$|From Fig.  9, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} using large-diameter bolts in the roadway bolt support can produce larger <b>working</b> <b>resistance</b> while the same {{displacement}} is produced in the surrounding rocks. Similarly, with the same load, the displacement is much smaller when large-diameter bolts are used compared to smaller-diameter bolts. The measured data also confirm this trend. For example, the increasing rate vertical closure was 14.4  mm/MPa without support; that value decreases 33.3  % to 9.6  mm/MPa when bolts of 18  mm diameter were used, and the value decreased 66.7  % to 4.8  mm/MPa when bolts of 30  mm diameter were used. This suggests that the use of large-diameter bolts has a pronounced effect on the control of the deformation of the surrounding rock.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the engineering geological properties and roof control tecnology for a thick coal seam fully-mechanized face mining with hard roof conditions (THC) at the Jinhuagong Coal Mine (JCM), northwest China. The effective support <b>working</b> <b>resistance</b> and appropriate roof control technology are two critical factors for safe and productive mining in the THC. The load-estimate-method (LOEM) is the effective method {{to determine the}} support <b>working</b> <b>resistance</b> for normal working conditions (the mining height less than 3. 5 m). In order to prevent support crushing accidents from happening and {{to ensure the safety}} and high-efficiency in the THC, the LOEM was modified based on the structure of the overlying strata in the THC. The strata which can form the voussoir beam structure in normal working conditions and will break in the form of cantilever beam in the THC is defined as the key strata in the immediate roof. Therefore, the hanging length of the key strata in the immediate roof was considered in the LOEM. Furthermore, a method for calculating the hanging length of the key strata in the immediate roof and its influencing factors were proposed using cantilever beam theory analysis {{of the structure of the}} overlying strata. Moreover, in order to fully fill the goaf area with caving roof to reduce the energy accumulation of main roof movement, it was decided to apply destress blasting technique (DEBT) at the JCM to control the large hanging length of the hard roof, so as to reduce the impact of the hard main roof movement on the working face. The key technique parameters of the roof caving borehole were also proposed. The obtained results demonstrated that the theoretical analysis is reasonable, and the chosen support type and the DEBT could meet the roof control requirements. The THC has achieved safety and high-efficiency mining...|$|E

These factors include the hydraulic support setting load and <b>working</b> <b>resistance,</b> the top beam action point of resultant force, the horizontal applied force from the top beam to roof rock, the face guarding moment, the distance from beam to rib, and working face mining rate.
