50|$|Starting from 1996, Beynon’s work {{revolved}} around a fictional character named Li Ji. The {{character is a}} heroine adapted from Chinese mythology, who has been transformed to examine hybridity and race. The myth itself is an ancient Chinese story written by Gan Bao, who recorded extraordinary feats imitating historical writing under the “strange tales” genre. The original story revolves around a young Chinese girl who steps out of her traditional, cultural role and saves her village by slaying a giant python. The art critic Maura Reilly states that through Li Ji, Beynon confronts issues about multiculturalism and immigration in contemporary Australian society. Beynon’s work also tackles the modern issues of race and identity. In Where is Your Original Home (a video of Li-Ji journeying across a modern Melbourne Chinatown), Beynon explores the question asked to many non-Anglo Australians: <b>where</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>from?</b> She deconstructs how a conversational question can turn hostile caused by the underlying assumptions about belonging.|$|E
