2500|$|A {{review of}} the album on Punknews.org was far more {{critical}} of the album, stating [...] "there is [...] "substance" [...] here—there are guitar solos, tempo changes, gang vocals—but there isn't substance. There's no authenticity; {{it just seems like}} the songs were built from a collection of [...] "brutal" [...] ideas written on pieces of paper, put together in a hat, and splashed out on the floor." [...] The album received a 1.5 out of 5 rating. A review on AbsolutePunk was also critical of the album, stating that while some songs were [...] "heavy, but catchy" [...] and [...] "sounds like it would have a room full of people moshing until they drop", at some points it feels like the band is [...] "half-arseing it", going on to say [...] "Sometimes you <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> throw in some thrash beats, and fast riffing. This can disappoint and I feel like a few solo's wouldn't go amiss." [...] However, the reviewer concludes by saying [...] "All in all, Suicide Season has impressed me. The boys from BMTH have come back and shown they aren't just a generic haircuts band." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maroney and Wieber were {{credited}} {{for changing}} the team's nickname from the [...] "Fab Five" [...] to the [...] "Fierce Five" [...] {{a few days before}} their gold medal win at the Olympics. [...] "I guess (Fab Five) was taken by some basketball team or something," [...] Maroney said, referring to the five members of the Michigan college basketball team recruited in 1991. Jalen Rose, a former Michigan Fab Five member, complained about the gymnastics team being dubbed the Fab Five as well. [...] "To use the nickname just points and screams of lazy journalism by the national media, that's really what it is," [...] Rose said. [...] "It's no fault at all of the young gymnasts. But I really <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have come up with an even more creative tag for them and their gold medal pursuit." [...] Maroney and Wieber decided for that reason to [...] "come up with an even more creative" [...] name while on the bus to a training session. They reportedly started searching on their phones for words that started with F that described the team. The top choices were feisty and fierce. Maroney and Wieber opted for [...] "fierce", as they said it described their floor routines, {{and the rest of the}} team concurred. Maroney also stated, [...] "There have been Fab Fives in the past but I like Fierce Five because we are definitely the fiercest team out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 17, 2008, Bachmann gave an {{interview}} on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews {{in support of the}} presidential campaign of Senator John McCain that brought the Minnesota 6th Congressional District race national attention. During the interview she criticized Barack Obama for his association with Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers, saying [...] "...usually we associate with people who have similar ideas to us, and it seems that it calls into question what Barack Obama's true beliefs, and values, and thoughts are... I am very concerned that he [...] may have anti-American views." [...] She noted the bombing campaign orchestrated by Bill Ayers before discussing his association with Barack Obama, arguing that [...] "Bill Ayers is not someone the average American wants to see their president have an association with." [...] Matthews followed up by asking [...] "But he [...] is a Senator from the State of Illinois; he's {{one of the members of}} Congress you suspect of being anti-American. How many people in the Congress of the United States do you think are anti-American? You've already suspected Barack Obama, is he alone or are there others?" [...] Bachmann answered, [...] "What I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating exposé and take a look... I <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would...</b> I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out are they pro-America, or anti-America.

2500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the second day, 10 December 1878, leaving Byrne in charge of the hostages, the other three started out to work. First they cut the telegraph wires, chopping the posts down to make sure, and were careful to destroy more wire than an ordinary repairer would carry with him. Three or four railway men endeavoured to interfere, but they too joined the other hostages in Younghusband's storeroom. Carrying a cheque drawn by McCauley on the National Bank for a few pounds, the three bushrangers, all heavily armed, went to the bank. (Kenneally relates that Hart who approached from the back ran into the bank's housemaid, Maggie Shaw, with whom he had been at school in Wangaratta.) In the meantime Byrne had unlawfully kidnapped a telegraph-line repairer, who had begun to make trouble. The others reached the bank after closing time, travelling in the hawker's cart. Kelly knocked at the door and forced the clerk to open and cash the cheque he had. They held up the unwise clerk and his manager, a Mr Scott. The robbers took £700 in notes, gold, and silver. Ned Kelly insisted to the manager that there was more money there, and eventually forced him to open the safe, from which the outlaws got £1,500 in paper, £300 in gold, about £300 worth of gold dust and nearly £100 worth of silver. The reported total amount stolen was 68 £10 notes, 67 £5 notes, 418 £1 notes, £500 in sovereigns, about £90 in silver; and a 30oz ingot of gold. The outlaws were polite and considerate to Scott's wife. Scott himself invited the outlaws to drink whisky with him, which they did. The whole party went to Younghusband's where the rest of the hostages were. The evening seems to have passed quite pleasantly. McCauley remarked to Kelly that the police might come along, which would mean a fight. Kelly replied, [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>they</b> <b>would,</b> for there is plenty of cover here." [...] In the evening, tea was prepared, and at half-past 8, the outlaws warned the hostages not to move for three hours, informing them that they were going. Just before they left, Kelly noticed that a Mr. McDougall was wearing a watch, and asked for it. McDougall replied that it was a gift from his dead mother. Kelly declared that he wouldn't take it under any consideration, and very soon afterwards the four of the outlaws left. What is unusual is that these stirring events happened without the people in the town knowing of anything. The hostages left the station after five hours.|$|E
