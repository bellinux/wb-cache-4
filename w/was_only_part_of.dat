5|$|Wind's view of Wodehouse's naïveté is {{not universally}} held. Biographers {{including}} Donaldson, McCrum and Phelps suggest that his unworldliness <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a complex character, {{and that in}} some respects he was highly astute. He was unsparing of the studio owners in his early-1930s short stories set in Hollywood, which contain what Taves considers Wodehouse's sharpest and most biting satire.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the Court of Appeal {{expanded}} the scope of judicial review by adopting an objective test when reviewing the exercise of executive discretion. In contrast to the subjective test, the objective test permits the court to examine whether the decision-maker's satisfaction was based on objective facts which fell {{within the scope of}} the purposes specified by the ISA. The subjective satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the executive body is insufficient. However, the adoption of this objective test <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the obiter dicta of the case. The ratio decidendi of the case was based on narrower technical grounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Chicago work {{went on a}} tour {{of eight}} cities before returning to Chicago in 1933 where it was displayed at the World's Fair. It was in a warehouse until it was purchased by Winston-Salem, North Carolina, artist and collector Joseph Wallace King in 1965. King had first seen the painting in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair. Years later he described the painting and how magnificent it was seeing it displayed in Chicago to his friend Ed Grout of Maryland. Mr. Grout arranged a meeting with the nephew of George McConnel and the painting was purchased by Mr. King. King appeared on the panel game show I've Got A Secret on May 30, 1966, displaying a 22' by 25' section of the painting (his secret was that this <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the painting). It was revealed that King had been searching for it for some time, and now that he'd found it, he hoped to construct a new cyclorama building.|$|E

Bledsoe started the season as the starting quarterback, but after losing the first four games, he was injured and replaced with former Dolphins backup Scott Secules, who won one of his two games.|$|E
25|$|After this, a fire {{department}} was established, {{made up of}} Jewish prisoners, with an acting fire chief. They relied on the newly constructed water system.

25|$|The most {{prominent}} feature for the boiler is the vertical copper firebox (the large vessel {{to the right}} in the illustration here). Within the vertical vessel was the inner firebox and {{the space between the}} two was filled with water (to a level just about the same as the driver’s ankle). (Coke) fuel was added from the top, where a tube passed down through the top of the firebox. This firebox construction was not dissimilar to some types of vertical boiler, but this <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Ericsson’s design.|$|E

Others point out that Citibank's relocation <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a more general transformation of the city's economy from an industrially based one to an economy centered on health care, finance and retail trade.|$|E

A master ad libber, Allen often tangled with his network's executives (and often barbed them on the air over the battles) while developing routines whose style and substance influenced fellow comic talents, including Groucho Marx, Stan Freberg, Henry Morgan and Johnny Carson; his avowed fans also included President Franklin D. Roosevelt and novelists William Faulkner, John Steinbeck and Herman Wouk (who began his career writing for Allen).|$|E
25|$|Consistent {{with her}} early career, Cox's style leaned more toward {{vaudeville}} than blues. She had a less powerful and less rugged voice than her better-known contemporaries Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey, but {{she held her}} audiences spellbound with the fiery spirit of her delivery. At {{the height of the}} classic female blues era, competition was stiff, with numerous talented blueswomen performing, and Cox's singing <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> her act. Nevertheless, as her career developed, she assumed and embodied the title bestowed on her, “The Uncrowned Queen of the Blues”. Onstage, she exuded a glamorous sophistication and confidence that captivated her fans. She also embellished her stage presence with a stylish wardrobe, which often included a tiara, cape and rhinestone wand.|$|E
25|$|Despite these {{setbacks}} in {{the implementation}} of evacuation policy early in the war, around 12 million Soviet citizens successfully evacuated in 1941, even if a number of these were the result of disorganised, “spontaneous self-evacuation,” and another 4.5 million evacuated the following year. In addition, the factories that were successfully evacuated to the Central Asian rear would help provide the productive capacity the Soviets needed to eventually win the war, as well as preventing the Germans from acquiring additional industrial resources. By providing a safe haven from the German advance for Soviet citizens, Central Asia {{played a critical role in}} securing Allied victory. The evacuation itself <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the difficulty, however, as evacuees arriving in Central Asia faced many trials and tribulations.|$|E

25|$|The {{extermination}} project lacked secrecy, and {{was therefore}} sabotaged from the outside. Baron Neumann of Végvár, a Banat Jewish industrialist, is credited with having coaxed and bribed some Romanian officials, focusing his effort on postponing all transports to Lublin {{for as long as}} was possible. According to historian Victor Neumann, the Baron's intervention <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a series of intersecting events. These include a propaganda and passive resistance effort mounted by other Jewish community leaders of the Banat, the discontent of Romanian railway employees, topical criticism coming from Romanian civil society representatives (Bishop Bălan, Iuliu Maniu), and, in some part, Antonescu's own doubts about Germany's ability to win the war. In that context, Romanian Jewish leaders also expressed solidarity with Polish Jews trapped on Romanian soil, persuading Lecca not to hand them over to the Germans.|$|E
25|$|On Wednesday October 3, 1934, Conacher was {{involved}} {{in one of the}} largest transactions in league history. He was dealt to the Montreal Canadiens, along with Leroy Goldsworthy and Roger Jenkins in exchange for Montreal superstar Howie Morenz, Lorne Chabot and Marty Burke. The deal <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a series of trades involving four teams that represented one of the biggest deals in NHL history. Immediately following the Chicago trade, Conacher was sent back to the Maroons, along with Herb Cain, in exchange for the rights to Nelson Crutchfield. Conacher spent his last three NHL seasons with the Maroons and won his second Stanley Cup in 1935. He ended his hockey career after the team was eliminated from the playoffs by the New York Rangers on April 23, 1937. That final year he was runner-up to Babe Siebert in the 1937 Hart Trophy voting and was placed on the NHL Second All-Star Team.|$|E

500|$|After the {{supporters}} of the Celtic dating had withdrawn following the Council of Whitby, Wilfrid became the most prominent Northumbrian cleric. As a result, and because of his performance at Whitby, Wilfrid was elected to a bishopric in Northumbria {{about a year after}} the council. It is unclear where his diocese was located, although he was considered to be Alhfrith's bishop. The Vita Sancti Wilfrithi states that, nominated by both Oswiu and Alhfrith, he was made bishop at York, and that he was a metropolitan bishop, but York at that time was not a Metropolitan Diocese. Bede says that Alhfrith alone nominated Wilfrid, and that Oswiu subsequently proposed an alternative candidate, [...] "imitating the actions of his son". Several theories have been suggested to explain the discrepancies between the two sources. One is that Alhfrith wished the seat to be at York, another is that Wilfrid was bishop only in Deira, a third supposes that Wilfrid was never bishop at York and that his diocese <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Deira. However, at that time the Anglo-Saxon dioceses were not strictly speaking geographical designations, rather they were bishoprics for the tribes or peoples.|$|E
