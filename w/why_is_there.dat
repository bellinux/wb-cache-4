25|$|Due to {{equipment}} {{rotation and}} maintenance concerns, Caltrain said in 2009 {{that it could}} not dedicate cars with higher bike capacity on trains with high bike demand. Many of you have written to ask a series of questions about this new effort: Why can’t we provide two bike cars on every train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on my train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on the most heavily used trains? <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> only one bike car on trains that are supposed to have two bike cars? The simplest answer to most of these questions is that we don’t have enough bike cars to put two on every train, or even on every peak train, and, in doing all we can to expand service for our cycling customers, we have to be mindful of the impact of these changes on our entire system and all of our customers, particularly on on-time performance. All of our cars, not just our bike cars, serve our entire schedule throughout our entire day, which means they rotate through the schedule, and also must be rotated out of service for fueling, washing, maintenance and federally mandated safety and operational inspections. A train set that starts its day in San Jose may finish its day in Millbrae and be cycled to San Francisco for its daily maintenance and to begin the next day at the San Francisco station. Because of this rotation – because of the demands of our entire service schedule – we can’t guarantee that a specific stop on the schedule will have a specific train.}} Eventually, two bike cars were added to every train consist by 2011, and in 2016, a third bike car was added to Bombardier consists.|$|E

2500|$|The {{resistivity}} {{of different}} materials varies by an enormous amount: For example, the conductivity of teflon is about 1030 times {{lower than the}} conductivity of copper. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> such a difference? Loosely speaking, a metal has large numbers of [...] "delocalized" [...] electrons that are not stuck in any one place, but free to move across large distances, whereas in an insulator (like teflon), each electron is tightly bound to a single molecule, and a great force is required to pull it away. Semiconductors lie between these two extremes. More details {{can be found in}} the article: Electrical resistivity and conductivity. For the case of electrolyte solutions, see the article: Conductivity (electrolytic).|$|E
2500|$|After Baylor, Rouse {{worked as}} a {{graduate}} assistant coach at Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas. He left the position in October 2007, and has not had another basketball job since; {{he has said that}} he has been blackballed for taping Bliss's statements. Despite the near-universal revulsion at Bliss's actions, many leading members of the college basketball coaching fraternity considered Rouse's recordings a serious breach of trust – for example, Mike Krzyzewski said that if he ever found out one of his assistants had been secretly taping him, [...] "there's no way he would be on my staff". Jeff Ray, the Midwestern coach who hired Rouse, commented: [...] "I'm {{right in the middle of}} it, don't get me wrong.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the startups, the growth of exploitation in the 1970s also involved the leading studio in the low-budget field. In 1973, American International gave a shot to director Brian De Palma, whose previous movie, a Warner Bros. comedy, had flopped badly. Reviewing Sisters, De Palma's first horror film, New Yorker critic Pauline Kael observed that its [...] "limp technique doesn't seem to matter {{to the people who}} want their gratuitous gore. The movie supplies it, but <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>there</b> so much gratuitous dumbness too?... e can't get two people talking {{in order to make a}} simple expository point without its sounding like the drabbest Republic picture of 1938." [...] Many examples of the so-called blaxploitation genre of the early and middle part of the decade, featuring stereotype-filled stories revolving around drugs, violent crime, and prostitution, were the product of AIP. One of blaxploitation's biggest stars was Pam Grier, who began her film career with a bit part in Russ Meyer's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970) and who had appeared in several New World pictures, including The Big Doll House (1971) and The Big Bird Cage (1972), both directed by Jack Hill. Hill also directed her best-known performances, in two AIP blaxploitation films: Coffy (1973) and Foxy Brown (1974). Grier has the distinction of starring in the first widely distributed movie to climax with a castration scene.|$|E
