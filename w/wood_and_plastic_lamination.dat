40|$|Fire {{is either}} {{man-made}} or natural. Sometimes it is started on purpose {{and other times}} it is an accident. Fire has a purpose, but comes with risks. This study was purposely conducted to identify the differences of fire growth pattern from different combustible materials, present and evaluate the temperature data obtained from the early fire growth stage to the decay stage of each combustible materials and also to identify which type of materials is the highly combustable materials. Each type of materials have its own fire growth pattern. The materials used for this research are the solid state of matter which consists of <b>plastics,</b> papers, <b>woods</b> <b>and</b> the combination of all the solid materials. The method {{have been used for}} the study is using fire simulation in the Fire Detection and Supression Simulator (Comprehensive Instrumented Type), Model FDSS-CI which is made of high quality 3 inter-connected chamber and integrated with Thermocouple, Smoke Detector and Control Room. The data was analyse using the Central Fire Detection and Execution System Software (C-FIDES). The finding of this study shows that the mixture of solid that consist of paper, <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>plastic</b> is the most highly combustible materials followed by paper, <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> lastly <b>plastic</b> materials. Besides that, solid mixture combustion shows the highest reading during the fully developed stage which is 138 °C followed by paper, <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>plastic.</b> The most short time taken for each combustible materials to achieve rapid growth stage is solid mixture within first 2 minute and followed by paper, <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>plastic.</b> Solid mixture that consist of paper, <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>plastic</b> more easy to ignite followed by paper, <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>plastic.</b> The most rapidly undergo decay stage is paper which is start to decay in the tenth minute followed by solid mixture, <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>plastic.</b> There are several recommendations that can be suggest for the future study. The future study may compare the combustion of <b>wood</b> with coating <b>and</b> <b>wood</b> without coating. Other than that, used materials with different state of matter such as liquid and gaseous and lastly, researcher do combustion in the real home to get the real situation and prediction for fire occurence...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was: (1) to {{determine}} whether polishing standardized proximal root surfaces with dental floss, Superfloss, <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>plastic</b> interdental cleaners, using a polishing paste, produces any significant change on root surface roughness; and (2) to determine the effectiveness of different number of strokes in polishing. 80 tooth specimens were prepared, 10 in each of 8 sample groups. Each proximal root surface was standardized with 600 A grit silicone carbide paper and polished with either waxed dental floss, Superfloss, wood or plastic interdental cleaners, using alkali aluminum silicate polishing paste. All specimens were mounted on a flossing machine and polished with 10 or 20 strokes. Before and after polishing, measurements were recorded with the Surfanalyzer 150 System to produce profile and average roughness tracings. Average maximum peak heights, mean number of peaks, and mean average roughness values were calculated from the tracings. The data were analyzed statistically by paired t-test and Student t-test. No significant mean {{differences were found between the}} number of strokes used. No significant differences were found for waxed dental floss in relation to the values analyzed. Significant differences were found for maximum peak heights for Superfloss following 20 strokes of polishing. However, no significant differences were found for Superfloss for mean number of peaks and average roughness. Significant differences were found for average roughness values, maximum peak heights, and mean number of peaks for the <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>plastic</b> interdental cleaners. It was concluded that root surface roughness increased significantly with the use of <b>wood</b> <b>and</b> <b>plastic</b> interdental cleaners but not with waxed dental floss or Superfloss...|$|R

40|$|A paper-based laboratory-on-a-chip assay for {{the rapid}} {{detection}} {{of a highly}} pathogenic strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) was developed for the first time. The single-unit chip was simply fabricated using Whatman filter paper <b>and</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>lamination.</b> The chip measured 2. 5 3. 0 cm 2 and was divided into two parts, one for nucleic acid amplification {{and the other for}} signal detection. The HP-PRRSV assay was performed by specific ORF I Nsp 2 gene amplification via an isothermal reverse transcription loop-mediated DNA amplification platform, whereas the cDNA signal detection was performed by visual observation of colorimetric changes in blue silver nanoplates (AgNPls). Positive results caused non-aggregation of the blue AgNPls on the detection pad, whereas negative results induced colorimetric changes in the AgNPls from blue to colourless on the pad. The assay had a limit of detection of 100 copies of the target Nsp 2 gene and high specificity for other types of infectious viruses. The assay required only one hour to complete. This work demonstrates a simple and rapid assay for viruses using a simple, low-cost, paper-based chip...|$|R
