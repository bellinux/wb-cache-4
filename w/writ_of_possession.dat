2500|$|A writ of {{assistance}} is a written order (a writ) issued {{by a court}} instructing a law enforcement official, such as a sheriff or a tax collector, to perform a certain task. Historically, several types of writs have been called [...] "writs {{of assistance}}". Most often, a writ of assistance is [...] "used to enforce an order for the possession of lands". When used to evict someone from real property, such a writ is also called a writ of restitution or a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession.</b> In the area of customs, writs of assistance were first authorized {{by an act of}} the English Parliament in 1660 (12 Charles 2 c. 29), and were issued by the Court of Exchequer to help customs officials search for smuggled goods. These writs were called [...] "writs of assistance" [...] because they called upon sheriffs, other officials, and loyal subjects to [...] "assist" [...] the customs official in carrying out his duties.|$|E

The University Registrar, Geoffrey Caston, sent an open letter to all Junior Members threatening proceedings in the High Court and disciplinary action against those who could be identified.

The officer then posts a notice for the tenant on the property that the officer will return on a specified day to remove the tenant from the property if the tenant has not moved. On that day, if necessary, the officer may physically remove the tenant and any other people on the property (though some jurisdictions will not enforce the writ if, on that day, inclement weather is taking place).|$|E

50|$|The exact {{origin of}} Batak is unknown, {{since there is}} a lack of {{historical}} data. The earlier view that the settlement was founded by Bulgarians who escaped from the forced mass conversion into Islam in the valley of Chepino in 16th century today is rejected because it is believed that the settlement is much older. This is justified by an inscription on the fountain of Virgin Mary Monastery of Krichim built by the people of Batak in 1592, a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> the feudal <b>possessions</b> <b>of</b> Sultan Suleiman I (1520-1566), in which the village of Batak is also mentioned, as well as the remnants of many churches and monasteries burnt down by the Ottomans during the conversion into Islam in this region. The origin of the name of Batak is not certain, too. In the old legends it is related to the Tsepina chieftain Batoy, while the history professors Yordan Ivanov and Vasil Mikov suppose that Batak was Potok, a settlement of Cuman origin existing between the 11th and the 13th century. It is, however, certain that the name of the village is Bulgarian, not Turkish as some authors assert.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> {{execution}} (also {{known as}} an execution) is a court order granted to put in force a judgment <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> obtained by a plaintiff from a court. When issuing a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> execution, a court typically will order a sheriff or other similar official to take <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> property owned by a judgment debtor. Such property will often then be sold in a sheriff's sale and the proceeds remunerated to the plaintiff in partial or full satisfaction of the judgment. It is generally considered preferable for the sheriff simply to take <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> money from the defendant's bank account. If the judgment debtor owns real property, the judgment creditor can record the execution to [...] "freeze" [...] the title until the execution is satisfied.|$|R

50|$|In his Commentaries, Blackstone {{noted that}} this common law writ would lie {{originally}} to prevent waste that took place between judgment in a real action and delivery <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> by the sheriff. Following the Statute <b>of</b> Gloucester, a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> estrepement pendente placito would lie to prevent estrepement pending {{the outcome of a}} case. Either writ empowered the sheriff to prevent such waste, allowing him to imprison the waster, and even to raise a posse comitatus to assist him. According to Finlason, the basic <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> estrepement was an original writ that had to be sued out of chancery, whereas the writ pendente placito was a writ issued from the bench.|$|R
