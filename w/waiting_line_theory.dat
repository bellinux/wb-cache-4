40|$|The type of this {{research}} is case study research at Ratu Supermarket Malang with title “Waiting Line Analysis to Get the Optimize Rate Service of cashier at Ratu Supermarket Malang”. A waiting line is a phenomenon that usually happen in almost firms or industry of service. A waiting line forms because of a temporary imbalance between the demand for service and the capacity of the system to provide the service. Company usually won’t lose the customers, so that company needs to increase their service by giving the service as fast as they can. To rich that purpose, <b>waiting</b> <b>line</b> <b>theory</b> can use to evaluating that problem and make some alternative solutions. The purpose of {{this research}} is to analyzing the waiting line and to get the optimize number of cashier at Ratu Supermarket Malang in first and middle of the month. The day research period split in three time period, morning, afternoon, and evening research time. The used analysis tool in the research is waiting line models. This model is used to know how much number of facilities (cashier) need to handle the arriving rate of customer at Ratu Supermarket Malang. There are some formula to to describe the operating characteristics of the service system in the waiting line model; average utilization of the system (ρ), probability that zero customers are in the system (Po), average number of customers in line (Lq), average waiting time of customers in line (Wq), average time spent in the system (Ws), average number of customers in the service system (Ls). The result {{of this research}} shows that in the weekend afternoon at start of the month need a cashier additional from 9 to 10 cashiers. In the middle of the month, top-level of cashier used are 10 cashier in the sunday afternoon. Both in the normal day in the start of the month and weekend {{in the middle of the}} month need about 8 to 9 number of cashier. Last, in the normal day at the middle of the month only need 7 to 8 number of cashier...|$|E

50|$|One {{important}} difference is service recovery. When an error occurs in service delivery, the recovery must be delivered {{on the spot}} by the service provider. If a waiter in a restaurant spills soup on the customer's lap, then the recovery could include a free meal and a promise of free dry cleaning. Another difference is in planning capacity. Since the product cannot be stored, the service facility must be managed to peak demand which requires more flexibility than manufacturing. Location of facilities must be near the customers and scale economics can be lacking. Scheduling must consider the customer can be <b>waiting</b> in <b>line.</b> Queuing <b>theory</b> has been devised to assist in design of service facilities <b>waiting</b> <b>lines.</b> Revenue management is important for service operations, since empty seats on an airplane are lost revenue when the plane departs and cannot be stored for future use.|$|R

40|$|<b>Waiting</b> <b>lines</b> {{occur in}} many {{business}} operations {{as well as}} in everyday life. Most service systems, such as fast food restaurants, Banks, gasoline stations, and technical support telephone hotlines involve customer waiting. In these systems customers arrive at random times and service times are rarely predictable. The important issue in designing such systems involves the tradeoff between customer waiting time and system cost, usually determined by number of servers. The analysis of <b>waiting</b> <b>lines,</b> called queuing <b>theory,</b> applies to any situations which customers arrive to the system wait and receive service. The People’s Bank is one of the important governmental banks that {{plays an important role in}} the Sri Lankan economy. The customers dealing with servers of general transaction section of Peoples Bank in metropolitan areas suffer and complain from the long times they spend in the bank to acquire their needed service. This happens especially in specific days in each week. This problem was the main motive to perform this study. However, more queuing problems in the bank’s branch have been discovered through the study. The main objectives of the study are to investigate the services delivery system at the people’s Bank in metropolitan areas, and to propose a more efficient system. Analytical methods and simulation methods are used to analyze the queuing systems. Simulation analysis has been used to model the existing queuing system and to enhance the system by using computer simulations of Arena 12. 0 statistical software.

The analysis of this model provides mathematical expressions for some of the key performance measures, such as average waiting time for admission. Results We calculate average occupancy in the facility and its relationship to system characteristics. For example, when the facility has 28 beds, the average wait for admission is 4 days. We also explore the relationship between arrival rate at the facility, the capacity of the facility, and waiting times. Conclusions One key aspect of the healthcare system is its complexity, and policy makers want to design and reform the system in a way that affects competing goals. OR methodologies, particularly queueing theory, can be very useful in gaining deeper understanding of this complexity and exploring the potential effects of proposed changes on the system without making any actual changes. </p...|$|R

40|$|Genesis. I {{have always}} been {{interested}} in <b>waiting</b> <b>lines</b> because <b>waiting</b> in <b>line</b> for me is like hell on earth. I take great pains to avoid <b>waiting</b> <b>lines.</b> My academic interest in queues, however, started when I tried to simulate <b>waiting</b> <b>lines</b> in a closed system such as a ski resort. Little did I know that I was trespassing on hostile territories. It turned out that queuing theory is a very well developed field with voluminous literature. It is hopeless to go through all the literature just to find out what has not been covered yet. All was not lost. A casual reading of the voluminous literature on queuing theory taught me that a queue must be present even in a steady-state service process. I then inferred that the greater the flow capacity (number of customers served per unit time), the longer must be the steady-state queue if the service process is not to be interrupted. And the minimum steady-state queue should not be regarded as a <b>waiting</b> <b>line</b> at all. Hence the title of this paper. I also noticed that Naor’s seminal paper that started the whole literature on regulating queue length with prices was based on a single-step service process. And this assumption was followed by almost all later contributors. Since I just finished a simulation on Goldratt’s scout hike, I knew well that the most binding bottleneck in a multiple-link process does not alway...|$|R

High-level simulation allows the design team to: a) supervise, analyze, and resume the critical paths of processing flows and information in each layout design, (b) refigure business system layout in order to reduce time losses and costs in the system c) eliminate inevitable bottlenecks present in almost every business, manufacturing and service system.

One important area that defines how well and efficient a fast food restaurant delivers its product and services to customers is its <b>waiting</b> <b>line</b> (queue) management practices. The study was conducted at Lipa City, involving five popular quick service restaurants named by the researcher as QSR A, B, C, D, and E.

The findings revealed the queuing system used and the <b>waiting</b> <b>line</b> structured utilized by the restaurants. The extent of implementation of the queue management practices in the three areas mentioned of the five QSR’s was presented comparatively. Likewise, the level of customer’s satisfaction on the queue management practices was also determined. Significant difference in the extent of implementation and in the level of customer satisfaction were determined if the respondents were grouped according to restaurant’s profile.
