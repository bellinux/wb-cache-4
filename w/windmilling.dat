500|$|Fry's podgrams {{consist of}} anecdotes, {{such as how}} he broke his arm while filming a {{documentary}} in Brazil. He has also presented lectures, discussed certain themes in detail, or argued against things he sees as being wrong in today's society. In discussing his hatred of dancing, he said of music, [...] "I {{do not want to}} use it as an exercise track for a farcical, meaningless, disgusting, brainless physical public exhibition of <b>windmilling,</b> gyrating and thrashing in a hot, loud room or hall." [...] The material is usually original for each podcast, but he may revisit topics that he has previously discussed. For example, one podgram consisted of a speech he had previously made concerning public service broadcasting. His apologetic explanation for the repeated subject matter described his busy life, and he stated that the podgram was [...] "all I can offer you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hughes did {{not follow}} the agreed testing program and {{communications}} protocol, and remained airborne almost {{twice as long as}} planned. An hour into the flight (after onboard recording cameras had run out of film), a leak caused the right-hand propeller controls to lose their effectiveness and the rear propeller subsequently reversed its pitch, disrupting that engine's thrust, which caused the aircraft to yaw hard to the right. The USAAF account said that, [...] "It appeared that loss of hydraulic fluid caused failure of the pitch change mechanism of right rear propeller. Mr. Hughes maintained full power of right engine and reduced that of left engine instead of trying to fly with right propeller <b>windmilling</b> without power. It was Wright Field's understanding that the crash was attributed to pilot error." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beginning {{with the}} P2V-5F model, the Neptune {{became one of}} the first {{aircraft}} in operational service to be fitted with both piston and jet engines. The Convair B-36, several Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter, Fairchild C-123 Provider, and Avro Shackleton aircraft were also so equipped. To save the weight and complexity of two separate fuel systems, the Westinghouse J34 jet engines on the P2Vs burned the same 115–145 Avgas fuel as the piston engines instead of jet fuel. The jet pods were fitted with intake doors that were kept closed when the J-34s were not running; this prevented <b>windmilling,</b> allowing for economical piston-engine-only long-endurance search and patrol operations. In normal U.S. Navy operations, the jet engines were run at full power (97%) to expedite and assure all takeoffs, then shut down when the aircraft reached a safe altitude. The jets were also started and kept running at flight idle during low-altitude ( [...] during the day and [...] at night) anti-submarine and/or anti-shipping operations as a safety measure in case one of the radials developed problems.|$|E

2500|$|The Arrowplane was not {{intended}} for production or to be roadable, but its success in the Vidal competition encouraged Waterman to form the Waterman Arrowplane Co. in 1935 for production of a roadable version. [...] The resulting Arrowbile, referred to by Waterman as the W-5, was similar both structurally and aerodynamically to the Arrowplane, though the fins differed in shape, with rounded leading edges and swept-back rudder hinges. For road use the wings and propeller could be quickly detached. [...] The main other differences were in engine choice, the need to drive the wheels and to use conventional car floor-type controls on the road. The air-cooled Menasco {{was replaced by a}} water-cooled engine as used by most cars. [...] Waterman modified a 6-cylinder upright, 100hp (75kW) Studebaker unit and placed it lower down in the pod, driving the propeller shaft {{at the top of the}} fuselage via six ganged V-belts with a 1.94:1 speed reduction. The radiator was in the forward fuselage, fed from a duct opening in the extreme upper nose. On the ground the engine drove the main wheels through a differential gear, as normal, and the car was steered by its nosewheel. The wheels were enclosed in fairings, initially as a road safety measure. Instead of removing the propeller for the road, it could be de-clutched to prevent it <b>windmilling</b> the engine at speed.|$|E

50|$|In this example, the {{correlation}} (simultaneity) between <b>windmill</b> activity and wind velocity {{does not imply}} that wind is caused by <b>windmills.</b> It is rather the other way around, as suggested by the fact that wind doesn’t need <b>windmills</b> to exist, while <b>windmills</b> need wind to rotate. Wind can be observed in places where there are no <b>windmills</b> or non-rotating windmills—and there are good reasons to believe that wind existed before the invention of <b>windmills.</b>|$|R

50|$|Canadian {{accident}} {{investigators found}} that a bevel gear in the oil pump drive had failed, shutting off lubrication to the propeller. This caused the propeller to decouple from the engine, allowing it to windmill at high speed. Moreover, during the emergency descent, the pilots had allowed the aircraft's airspeed to increase {{too close to the}} maximum allowable. This put significant strain on the <b>windmilling</b> propeller and in all probability caused it to fail in flight. The possibility of the bevel gear drive failing causing the propeller to windmill had not been foreseen by Vickers engineers, and there was therefore no mention of it in the training or operations manual.|$|E
5000|$|Almost all spike mauls take a {{standard}} 36 in oval eye sledge hammer handle, which is frequently replaced {{through the course}} of heavy use.

It also makes the [...] "windmill" [...] spiking technique more comfortable. <b>Windmilling</b> is when a user takes the maul handle with both hands locked and strikes the spike with repeated fast blows by swinging in a circular motion over the shoulder. The standard [...] "wood chopping" [...] motion is more comfortable and natural for most people.|$|E
50|$|By 1918 a Clerget {{handbook}} advised maintaining {{all necessary}} control {{by using the}} fuel and air controls, and starting and stopping the engine by turning the fuel on and off. The recommended landing procedure involved shutting off the fuel using the fuel lever, while leaving the blip switch on. The <b>windmilling</b> propeller made the engine continue to spin without delivering any power as the aircraft descended. It was important to leave the ignition on to allow the spark plugs to continue to spark and keep them from oiling up, so that the engine could (if all went well) be restarted simply by re-opening the fuel valve. Pilots were advised to not use an ignition cut out switch, as it would eventually damage the engine.|$|E

50|$|Even after shutdown, {{the engines}} were still <b>windmilling</b> (rotating {{due to the}} passage of the air through them). This gave the {{airplane}} some rudimentary and unreliable hydraulic control, but was better than having no power at all. Garcez commanded the lowering of the flaps, which only moved to position Two, (around 10 degrees) due to the failing hydraulic system. With the batteries discharged, there was no electrical power and the only four instruments working in the cockpit were the artificial horizon, the altimeter, the airspeed indicator and the vertical speed indicator. The only thing the crew could see on the horizon were faint light spots due to distant forest burnings, and at 21:06, local time, the plane crash-landed over treetops that extended over 50 m above ground.|$|E

The band surprised early audiences accustomed to the generally shambling, lo-fi and collage-like quality of the records with their energetic live show, featuring Pollards homegrown rock theatrics (consisting of karate-kicks, leaps, and Roger Daltrey-inspired mic-twirling), Mitch Mitchells <b>windmilling</b> and chain smoking, sometime bassist Greg Demos striped pants, a never-ending barrage of tunes that all seemed to clock in under 90 seconds, and prodigious alcohol consumption all around.|$|E
5000|$|In {{subsequent}} {{correspondence between}} the NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), {{included in the final}} report, the NTSB questioned the then-available operating procedures and manuals for the aircraft.

For example, it was not clear based on existing instructions and guidelines whether a missed approach would be indicated and/or possible under these circumstances, and if so, what would be the recommended procedure to successfully execute the maneuver. Also, the condition of a shut down but unfeathered engine, i.e. <b>windmilling</b> propeller with high asymmeteric drag and minimum control implications, which was encountered in this accident, was insufficiently covered, according to the NTSB.|$|E
