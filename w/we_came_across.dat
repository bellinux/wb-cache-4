500|$|Upon {{reaching}} the accident site, investigators from the NTSB found both engines, {{the wings and}} empennage had separated from the fuselage, which had largely been consumed by fire. It was clear to investigators the aircraft had encountered a bird strike upon take-off. One pilot who landed at around the time the Learjet took off told the Gadsden Times, [...] "Just as <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> the runway it was almost black with birds. They swarmed and parted as we went through them." ...|$|E
500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E

2500|$|In My Game Your Game Campese remembered that, [...] "...that loss in New Zealand {{also had}} a {{positive}} effect. We {{made a lot of}} mistakes and the All Blacks managed only a narrow win. I knew that day that we'd beat New Zealand whenever <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> them at the World Cup. It was the first time I could ever recall looking ahead and thinking we'd beat those guys." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{research}} {{the producers of}} El Norte learned {{about the plight of}} indigenous Guatemalans from years of research, much of it conducted among exiles living in Southern California. According to Nava, [...] "There are hundreds of thousands of refugees from Central America in Los Angeles alone. Nobody knows the exact number, but a recent television inquiry estimated 300,000-400,000. In our own research, <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> a community of Mayans from Guatemala—5,000 from one village—now in Los Angeles. The original village, which is now dead, had 15,000." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 'It {{was obvious}} once <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> {{it that it}} was a big war ship. [...] It had to be {{because of the number of}} guns there. [...] The lack of any steel made us realise that we were dealing with a timber ship and very soon {{afterwards}} we found the hull structure. [...] We believe it is the HMS Resolution. We can't be certain until we can find something so that we can date it. But with all the information pulled in for us, it looks most likely that it is the Resolution.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Lavender, {{when they}} had {{proceeded}} some twenty miles along the road for home, [...] "my hunger is excessive. If <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> an hotel, Joe, pull up." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But WE mus'n't eat them," [...] the Wizard {{warned the}} children, [...] "or we too may become invisible, and lose each other. If <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> {{another of the}} strange fruit we must avoid it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Detractors {{have accused}} Death in June of {{harboring}} neo-Nazi sympathies. [...] Pearce has said, [...] "At {{the start of}} the eighties, Tony and I were involved in radical left politics and beneath it history students. In search of a political view for the future <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> National Bolshevism which is closely connected with the Sturmabteilung hierarchy. People like Gregor Strasser and Ernst Röhm who were later known as 'second revolutionaries' attracted our attention." [...] The Sturmabteilung (Stormtroopers) were a paramilitary unit of the Nazi Party (NSDAP), and Strasser and Röhm were Nazi leaders who vied for Adolf Hitler's power.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking of {{the video}} to MTV, Reynolds said [...] "We read through a ton of scripts from really talented directors, and <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> one that stood out to us in particular, because it put into visuals the general theme of the song, {{which is kind of}} an {{empowering}} song about an awakening, but it did {{it in a way that}} was very different". [...] "A lot of people probably see a post-apocalyptic world when they hear 'Radioactive', understandably, but we wanted to deliver something that was maybe a little different from that ... a lot different from that." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "They [...] {{attacked}} Rus, {{where they}} made great havoc, destroying cities and fortresses and slaughtering men; and they laid siege to Kiev, {{the capital of}} Rus; after they had besieged the city for a long time, they took it and put the inhabitants to death. When we were journeying through that land <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> countless skulls and bones of dead men lying about on the ground. Kiev had been a very large and thickly populated town, but now it has been reduced almost to nothing, for there are {{at the present time}} scarce two hundred houses there and the inhabitants are kept in complete slavery" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then why haven't <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> him?" [...] Jacob demanded, fiercely. [...] "This is {{the fourth}} time we've had their camp in full view, an' if he was with 'em {{we ought to have}} seen somethin' of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We, therefore, {{tried to}} turn the pack by {{coasting}} along it, but, although we ran over a hundred miles along its edge, in a westerly direction, never a lead did <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> which offered any hopes of getting through.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{guess that}} cayuse of yourn'll carry double for a while," [...] {{answered}} the sanguine Bob. [...] "We'll annex the first animal <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>across.</b> By jingoes, <b>we</b> made a haul, didn't we? Accordin' to the marks on this money there's $30,000--$15,000 apiece!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Good luck to you; but I fancy {{nothing short}} of a crowbar would make Dick wince. His soul seems to have been fired before <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> him. He"s {{intensely}} suspicious and utterly lawless." ...|$|E
5000|$|A critic from Sify.com said, [...] "Pranayam is in {{an entirely}} {{different}} league, far above most films that <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> in Malayalam, but still it falls short of being a brilliant one. It has some fine moments, but you will need some patience to find those, in between!".|$|R

60|$|We {{changed the}} subject; it irritated {{me to hear}} him talk. The {{beautiful}} Juno-like creatures <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> further on in Germany, he said were too fat. He wanted to see them run. I found him utterly soulless.|$|E
50|$|The next of {{the four}} {{components}} is input or also known as perceptions. Input is the meanings of how one sees oneself in a situation.

6000|$|... "It {{strikes me}} there's only one {{suitable}} plan," [...] he said. [...] "I {{know something about}} western farming.

I'd better go out and take charge until things are straightened up, or <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>across</b> somebody fit for the post." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will manage}} that, Colonel. She will be warm enough {{as long as}} she is on the march with me; but as, even before that fire, she has not enough on her, we will {{contrive}} something.

6000|$|... "No," [...] he said slowly. [...] "That is, we didn't quite {{run out of}} it, though once {{or twice}} for several days <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>across</b> only a small creek or two. There were signs that in some seasons {{it would be a}} dry country." ...|$|E
