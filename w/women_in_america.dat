5|$|In {{addition}} to addressing gender inequity in research, {{a number of}} countries have made women's health the subject of national initiatives. For instance in 1991 in the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services established an Office on Women's Health (OWH) with the goal of improving the health of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>America,</b> through coordinating the women's health agenda throughout the Department, and other agencies. In the twenty first century the Office has focussed on underserviced women. Also, in 1994 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established its own Office of Women's Health (OWH), which was formally authorised by the 2010 Affordable Health Care Act (ACA).|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> were {{reaching}} out for greater control of their lives. Husbands and fathers directed the lives of women, and many doors were closed to female participation. State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property, signing contracts, serving on juries and voting in elections. Women's prospects in employment were dim: they could expect only to gain a very few service-related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the same work. In Massachusetts, Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 {{as an attempt to}} find a way in which men and women could work together, with women receiving the same compensation as men. The experiment failed.|$|E

25|$|A {{crisis of}} {{political}} loyalties could disrupt {{the fabric of}} colonial America women's social worlds: whether a man {{did or did not}} renounce his allegiance to the King could dissolve ties of class, family, and friendship, isolating women from former connections.

500|$|Historian Deborah Gray White {{builds on}} Blassingame's {{research}} of the family life of the slaves in Ar'n't I a Woman?: Female Slaves in the Plantation South (1985). Her argument is similar to Blassingame's: [...] "This present study {{takes a look at}} slave <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> and argues that they were not submissive, subordinate, or prudish and that they were not expected to be so." [...] White discusses the Mammy and Jezebel stereotypes often applied to African American women by white Americans. She calls The Slave Community [...] "a classic" [...] but remarks that [...] "Blassingame stressed the fact that many masters recognized the male {{as the head of the}} family. He observed that during courtship men flattered women and exaggerated their prowess. There was, however, little discussion of the reciprocal activities of slave women." [...] She concludes that Blassingame [...] "described how slave men gained status in the family, but he did not do the same for women." ...|$|E
500|$|Angelou's {{original}} {{goal was}} {{to write about the}} lives of Black <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>America,</b> but her goal evolved in her later volumes to document {{the ups and downs of}} her own life. [...] Angelou's autobiographies had the same structure: a historical overview of the places she was living in at the time and how she coped within the context of a larger white society, as well as the ways that her story played out within that context. [...] Angelou, especially in her third autobiography, Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas, successfully demonstrated the integrity of the African-American character as she experienced more positive interactions with whites. [...] In Angelou's second volume, Gather Together in My Name, Angelou was concerned with what it meant to be a Black female in the U.S., but she focused upon herself at a certain point in history. Writer Selwyn Cudjoe said regarding her second autobiography: [...] "It is almost as though the incidents in the text were simply 'gathered together' under the name of Maya Angelou." ...|$|E
500|$|Beginning with Caged Bird {{and ending}} with her final autobiography, Angelou used the metaphor of a bird, which {{represented}} Angelou's confinement resulting from racism and depression, struggling to escape its cage, {{as described in the}} Paul Laurence Dunbar poem [...] "Sympathy". [...] Angelou's autobiographies can be placed in the African-American literature tradition of political protest. [...] Their unity underscored one of Angelou's central themes: the injustice of racism and how to fight it. [...] According to scholar Pierre A. Walker, all of Angelou's books described [...] "a sequence of lessons about resisting racist oppression". [...] In the course of her autobiographies, her views about Black-white relationships changed and she learned to accept different points of view. [...] Angelou's theme of identity was established from the beginning of her autobiographies, with the opening lines in Caged Bird, and like other female writers in the late 1960s and early 1970s, she used the autobiography to reimagine ways of writing about women's lives and identities in a male-dominated society. Her original goal was to write about the lives of Black <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>America,</b> but it evolved in her later volumes to document {{the ups and downs of}} her life.|$|E

500|$|Goldman's {{circle of}} radicals, socialists, and bohemians was joined in 1912 by a nurse, Margaret Sanger, whose {{mother had been}} through 18 pregnancies in 22 years, and died at age 50 of {{tuberculosis}} and cervical cancer.Engelman, pp. 29–30 (Goldman circle).Cox, p. 4 (pregnancies).Buchanan, p. 121 (tuberculosis and cancer).Chelsler, p. 41 (age 50). In 1913, Sanger worked in New York's Lower East Side, often with poor women who were suffering due to frequent childbirth and self-induced abortions.Kennedy, pp. 16–18. After one particularly tragic medical case, Sanger wrote: [...] "I threw my nursing bag {{in the corner and}} announced... that I would never take another case until I had made it possible for working <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> to have the knowledge to control birth." [...] Sanger visited public libraries, searching for information on contraception, but nothing was available.Cronin, Mary (1996), [...] "The Woman Rebel", in Women's periodicals in the United States: social and political issues, Endres, Kathleen L. (Ed.), Greenwood Press, p. 448.Cronin cites Sanger, An Autobiography, pp. 95–96.Cronin cites Kennedy, p. 19, who points out that some materials on birth control were available in 1913. She became outraged that working-class women could not obtain contraception, yet upper-class women who had access to private physicians could.|$|E
500|$|Arthur Munby {{observed}} {{that in the}} [...] "barbarous locality" [...] of Wigan, {{the sight of a}} female colliery worker wearing trousers was [...] "not half as odd as a woman wearing a crinoline," [...] exposing his own upper-class attitudes. In Australia, poorer rural women were photographed posing outside their slab huts, wearing their best dresses with crinolines. The French sociologist and economist Frédéric le Play carried out surveys of French working-class families' wardrobes from 1850–75, in which he found that two women had crinolines in their wardrobe, both wives of skilled workers. One, the fashion-conscious wife of a glove-maker, owned two crinolines and eleven dresses, although her usual everyday clothing consisted of wooden shoes and printed aprons. In America, the mid-19th century crinoline has become popularly associated with the image of the Southern Belle, a young woman from the American Deep South's upper socioeconomic, slave-owning classes. However, as in Europe and elsewhere, the crinoline was far from exclusively worn by wealthy white women. Both black and white <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>America</b> of all classes and social standings wore hooped skirts, including First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln and her African-American dressmaker, Elizabeth Keckley, who created many of Mrs. Lincoln's own extravagant crinolines.|$|E
