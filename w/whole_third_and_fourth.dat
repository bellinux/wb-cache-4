Indians in the UK are the largest community outside of Asia proportionally, and the second largest in terms of population, only surpassed by the United States, and closely followed by Canada. The first wave of Indians in the United Kingdom worked as manual labourers and were not respected within society. However, this has changed considerably. On the <b>whole,</b> <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> generation immigrants are proving to be very successful, especially in the fields of law, business and medicine.|$|E
50|$|As a <b>whole,</b> the <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> {{phases of}} Langs' work {{have not been}} met with the {{interest}} or enthusiasm of his first two phases. Langs acknowledged this state of affairs, but also suggested {{that at least some}} of the lukewarm reception of his work might have been due to the unpleasantness of the message, namely, that the roots of psychic conflict are in death-related trauma and anxiety, requiring therefore of both patient and therapist that they face their own death anxieties head-on.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the morphological characteristics and lodging-related traits and comparison of improved cultivars of rice plant resistance to lodging, a field experiment {{was carried out in}} randomized complete block design with three replications in 2012 at the Rice Research Institute of Iran) Rasht(. Rice cultivars were Kadus, Khazar, Gohar, Dorfak, Sepidrood and Deylam and local rice cultivar (Hashemi; susceptible to lodging as a control). Plant height, stem length, internode length for the first, second, <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes, diameter, thickness and cross- section area of <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes, ratio of fresh weight and dry weight of <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes to internode length, breaking resistance, bending moment and lodging resistance of <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes <b>and</b> pushing resistance were examined. Khazar cultivar with greater thickness of <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes (4. 11 and 4. 26 mm), diameter of <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes (8. 33 and 9. 46 mm), cross- section area of the <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes (40. 96 and 52. 32 mm 2) and ratio of fresh weight of <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes to internode length (301. 48 and 444. 15 mg. cm- 1) and ratio of dry weight of <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes to internode length (49. 46 and 50. 38 mg. cm- 1), breaking resistance of the <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes (14. 43 and 20. 87 N, respectively) was found to be the most resistant cultivar. Khazar cultivar with a plant height of 121 cm was found to be the tallest among all studied cultivars. Considering the strong correlation found between thickness, stem diameter, cross- section area of <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes <b>and</b> ratio of fresh weight and dry weight of <b>third</b> <b>and</b> <b>fourth</b> internodes to internode length with breaking resistance and pushing resistance, it seems that these traits could be considered as indirect indices in selection for higher resistance of rice cultivars to lodging...|$|R
