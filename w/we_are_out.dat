"We protest {{before your}} Majesty {{and the whole}} world that until this great person be removed from {{intermeddling}} with the great affairs of state, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of hope of any good success; and do fear that any money we shall or can give will, through his misemployment, be turned rather to the hurt and prejudice of this your kingdom than otherwise, as by lamentable experience we have found those large supplies formerly and lately given." [...] Despite Parliament's protests, however, Charles refused to dismiss his friend, dismissing Parliament instead.|$|E
500|$|Attention {{focused on}} the battle between Ralf Schumacher and Michael Schumacher during the race. Michael Schumacher blamed his brother for instigating the move and did not {{understand}} why he was upset over the incident. Ralf Schumacher did not comment and stated that he would watch a video of the incident before he would say anything. Their father, Rolf talked to the pair {{in an effort to}} get them reconciled. One week after the race, Ralf Schumacher said that tensions between him and his brother had eased and that there were no hard feelings for each other, saying, [...] "It's a lot of fun when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> there on the track duelling against each other." [...] There was similar ill-feeling between de la Rosa and Alesi after their collision on lap two. de la Rosa accused Alesi of blocking him, and of causing the crash by not looking in his mirrors, while Alesi said de la Rosa attempted to overtake him in a corner where overtaking is difficult.|$|E
500|$|On August 5, 2011, Guillermo del Toro {{stated that}} the remake would reflect his {{original}} vision for the film, {{and that it had}} been planned even when the first version was in production. [...] "Even when we produced the Spanish movie, I had intended to remake it because we had a very different screenplay that, because of money and time, got turned into the movie you saw – which is great, but there was this other structure for the original script that I wanted to try. So even before we shot the first film it was an economic decision, a pre-existing creative decision, to change it." [...] Del Toro also praised the new film's director. [...] "We have Mark Pellington attached as director – I'm a big fan of his The Mothman Prophecies and his video work – and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> to actors, so we're hoping to get things going soon." [...] On August 30, 2011, it was reported that American actress Amy Adams was in talks to star as Laura, the main character, who was played by Belén Rueda in the original film. It was also {{stated that the}} current incarnation of the remake screenplay had been written by Larry Fessenden and Sergio G. Sánchez, the sole writer of the original film.|$|E

500|$|Wilson {{nominally}} {{produced the}} Mothers' second album Absolutely Free (1967), which {{was recorded in}} November 1966, and later mixed in New York, although by this time Zappa was in de facto control of most facets of the production. It featured extended playing by the Mothers of Invention and focused on songs that defined Zappa's compositional style of introducing abrupt, rhythmical changes into songs that were built from diverse elements. Examples are [...] "Plastic People" [...] and [...] "Brown Shoes Don't Make It", which contained lyrics critical of the hypocrisy and conformity of American society, {{but also of the}} counterculture of the 1960s. As Zappa put it, [...] "e're satirists, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> to satirize everything." [...] At the same time, Zappa had recorded material for an album of orchestral works to be released under his own name, Lumpy Gravy, released by Capitol Records in 1967. Due to contractual problems, the album was pulled. Zappa took the opportunity to radically restructure the contents, adding newly recorded, improvised dialogue. After the contractual problems were resolved, the album was reissued by Verve in 1968. It is an [...] "incredible ambitious musical project", a [...] "monument to John Cage", which intertwines orchestral themes, spoken words and electronic noises through radical audio editing techniques.|$|E
2500|$|... "Even if {{what he did}} {{were the}} right thing to do, this was not the way to do it." [...] "The {{surrender}} might have been necessary: the cant was not. Any statesman with a sense of honour would at least have stilled that hysterical cheering and said: My friends, for the present, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of danger. But remember that others, who trusted in us, are not. This is a day for relief, perhaps; but for sorrow also; for shame, not for revelling. But this Chamberlain comes home beaming as fatuously as some country-cousin whom a couple of card-sharpers in the train have just allowed to win sixpence, to encourage him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{families}} of prisoners, {{the staff of}} closed and censored publications, the victims of eviction and confiscation — none were ever turned away. I have met influential [...] "civil society" [...] Palestinians alive today who were protected as students when Israel was a professor of chemistry at the Hebrew University; from him they learned never to generalize about Jews. And they respected him, not just for his consistent stand against discrimination, but also because — he never condescended to them. He detested nationalism and religion, and {{made no secret of}} his contempt for the grasping Arafat entourage. But, as he once put it to me, [...] "I will now only meet with Palestinian spokesmen when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of the country. I have some severe criticisms to present to them. But I cannot do this while they are living under occupation, and I can 'visit' them as a privileged citizen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kasey Kahne {{took the}} lead on the second Green-White-Checker attempt and held off Matt Kenseth to score his first win of the season. [...] "Yeah, man, it took a lot," [...] said Kahne. [...] "We {{were all over the}} place during the race but the guys stayed with me and worked hard. On those restarts– I didn't know what would happen because I had great restarts all night and I {{struggle}} with restarts a lot. That's big, because {{that is one of the}} things you have to be good at and it worked really well tonight. Yeah, we are locked in and I hate it comes down to this Atlanta or Richmond just about every year for me," [...] said Kahne. [...] "Sometimes we are in, sometimes <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out.</b> But thankful that now at HMS I have been in all three years now." [...] "Those last two laps were really intense," [...] Kenseth said. [...] "Things are looking up. I'm looking forward to the next 11." [...] "I couldn't capitalize, couldn't get the restarts and couldn't accelerate," [...] Denny Hamlin said. [...] "We just came up short. Third is about the place car we had tonight." ...|$|E
2500|$|After this, Jimmy's sidekick, Guillermo, {{appeared}} in a spoof of The Bourne Ultimatum, which starred Damon. He was then chased down by Damon, who was cursing about Kimmel being behind all this. Guillermo also stopped Damon {{on the red carpet}} one time and before he could finish the interview he said, [...] "Sorry, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of time." [...] The most recent encounter was titled [...] "The Handsome Men's Club" [...] which featured Kimmel, along with the [...] "Handsome Men", who were: Matthew McConaughey, Rob Lowe, Lenny Kravitz, Patrick Dempsey, Sting, Keith Urban, John Krasinski, Ethan Hawke, Josh Hartnett, Tony Romo, Ted Danson, Taye Diggs, Gilles Marini, and Ben Affleck, speaking about being handsome and all the jobs that come with it. At the end of the skit Kimmel has a door slammed in his face by none other than Matt Damon, stating that they had run out of time and then Damon continues with a sinister laugh. Jennifer Garner also makes a surprise appearance. As a tradition, celebrities voted off Dancing with the Stars appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, causing Kimmel to describe himself as [...] "the three-headed dog the stars must pass on their way to No-Dancing Hell".|$|E

6000|$|... "That it does. It {{is really}} the first time <b>we</b> have <b>been</b> alone since <b>we</b> left Lima, except, of course, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> {{shooting}} together." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Good-night, Mr. Cossey. Next {{time that}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>out</b> {{shooting}} together I expect I shall be nowhere. It {{was an awful}} fluke of mine killing those four birds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was something," [...] she said. [...] "Of course <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>out</b> there, and got no news of anything." [...] She {{could not}} take the risk.|$|R
