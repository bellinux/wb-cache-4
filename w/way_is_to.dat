5|$|There are {{different}} ways to determine the value of c. One <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which {{can be done in}} various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, it is also possible to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε0 and μ0 and using their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling c.|$|E
5|$|The {{conventional}} {{level of}} moral reasoning {{is typical of}} adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of {{the third and fourth}} stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} general {{ways to prevent}} creep in metal. One <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use higher melting {{temperature}} metals. The second <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use materials with greater grain size. The third <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use alloying.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} ways to play six bells at a time (i.e., to ring three bells in each hand). One <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> pick two bells up as if one were Shelley ringing, then pick the third up between one's little and ring fingers (a 'triple Shelley'). All three bells ring {{together}} when ringing in a knocking motion. A second <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> pick up the third bell sideways so the clapper swings outward. Ringers with good control can then ring the first bell without ringing the third, allowing him or her to play three notes in one hand.|$|E

30|$|Next, we {{analyzed}} another weighting strategy, {{which is based}} on the guided-image filter [15]. The cost volume was computed in two <b>ways.</b> One <b>way</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use a combination of the truncated absolute difference of the color and the gradient, as in [15]. The other <b>way</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use the DAISY feature vector. On the two stereo pairs, this strategy did not produce good disparity estimates, even using both ways of computing the cost volumes. This result suggests that the weighting strategy based on the guided-image filter may not be suitable for wide-baseline stereo matching.|$|R
25|$|One <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{have enough}} {{switching}} fabric {{to assure that}} the pairwise allocation will always succeed by building a fully connected mesh network. This is the method usually used in central office switches, which have low utilization of their resources.|$|E
25|$|Value {{investing}} {{has proven}} to be a successful investment strategy. There are several ways to evaluate its success. One <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> examine the performance of simple value strategies, such as buying low PE ratio stocks, low price-to-cash-flow ratio stocks, or low price-to-book ratio stocks. Numerous academics have published studies investigating the effects of buying value stocks. These studies have consistently found that value stocks outperform growth stocks and the market as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Many methods, which differ {{according}} to different regions, exist {{to stop a}} woman from turning into a Churel. One <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> bury the body and fill the grave with thorns and pile heavy stones on top to stop the evil spirit from getting out. If a woman dies during pregnancy, her body is cut open to take the child out and both mother and child are buried in the same grave.|$|E

25|$|A key {{business}} concern must then be how to attract users prior to reaching critical mass. One <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> rely on extrinsic motivation, {{such as a}} payment, a fee waiver, or a request for friends to sign up. A more natural strategy {{is to build a}} system that has enough value without network effects, at least to early adopters. Then, as the number of users increases, the system becomes even more valuable and is able to attract a wider user base.|$|E
25|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscope {{can remove}} SAM molecules in many different ways. The first is to remove them mechanically by dragging the tip across the substrate surface. This {{is not the most}} desired technique as these tips are expensive and dragging them causes a lot of wear and reduction of the tip quality. The second <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> degrade or desorb the SAM molecules by shooting them with an electron beam. The {{scanning tunneling microscope}} can also remove SAMs by field desorption and field enhanced surface diffusion.|$|E
25|$|The {{easiest way}} to locate the {{constellation}} is to find its two brightest stars Castor and Pollux eastward from the familiar “V” shaped asterism of Taurus and the three stars of Orion’s belt. Another <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> mentally draw {{a line from the}} Pleiades star cluster located in Taurus and the brightest star in Leo, Regulus. In doing so, you are drawing an imaginary line that is relatively close to the ecliptic, a line which intersects Gemini roughly at the midpoint of the constellation, just below Castor and Pollux.|$|E

25|$|Limits are not {{the only}} {{rigorous}} approach to the foundation of calculus. Another <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use Abraham Robinson's non-standard analysis. Robinson's approach, developed in the 1960s, uses technical machinery from mathematical logic to augment the real number system with infinitesimal and infinite numbers, as in the original Newton-Leibniz conception. The resulting numbers are called hyperreal numbers, and they can be used to give a Leibniz-like development of the usual rules of calculus. There is also smooth infinitesimal analysis, which differs from non-standard analysis in that it mandates neglecting higher power infinitesimals during derivations.|$|E
25|$|The {{dimension}} of an algebraic variety {{may be defined}} in various equivalent ways. The most intuitive way is probably the {{dimension of}} the tangent space at any Regular point of an algebraic variety. Another intuitive <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> define the dimension {{as the number of}} hyperplanes that are needed in order to have an intersection with the variety that is reduced to a finite number of points (dimension zero). This definition is {{based on the fact that}} the intersection of a variety with a hyperplane reduces the dimension by one unless if the hyperplane contains the algebraic variety.|$|E
25|$|The Iraqi Kurds {{may be seen}} in two ways. The {{first and}} the most common <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> view the Kurds as victims, both of the central {{government}} in Iraq and of neighbouring powers – particularly Turkey. The second opposing position is to see them as an agent provocateur, acting as proxy forces for states opposed to the incumbent Iraqi regime. This polarised notion of their status may be too simplistic, when one considers that there are opposing agendas within Iraqi Kurdistan with regard to issues such as the relationship with Turkey, nationalist aspirations and relations globally.|$|E

25|$|Scientist have {{discovered}} {{it is possible}} to determine, to some extent, the presence of these compounds in the grape before harvest. One <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> measured with gas chromatograph-mass spectrometers. Another method is through analysis of the glycosyl-glucose assay. Through this method glycosides from the grape juice are isolated and then hydrolysized to yield glucose. The amount of glucose produced is then quantified and tabulated in results that are expressed as amount of glycosides in micromoles per liter or per grape berry. The relationship between the presence of glycosides in wine grapes and the potential for quality in the resulting wine is not exact science but this remains an area of continuing research and development.|$|E
25|$|A way {{for making}} {{formulae}} referring to different worlds not interacting {{in the wrong}} <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{make sure that all}} formulae of a branch refer to the same world. This condition is initially true as all formulae in the set to be checked for consistency are assumed referring to the same world. When expanding a branch, two situations are possible: either the new formulae refer to the same world as the other one in the branch or not. In the first case, the rule is applied normally. In the second case, all formulae of the branch that do not also hold in the new world are deleted from the branch, and possibly added to all other branches that are still relative to the old world.|$|E
25|$|Ideally, campfires {{should be}} made in a fire ring. If a fire ring is not available, a {{temporary}} fire site may be constructed. Bare rock or unvegetated ground is ideal for a fire site. Alternatively, turf may be cut away to form a bare area and carefully replaced after the fire has cooled to minimize damage. Another <b>way</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> cover the ground with sand, or other soil mostly free of flammable organic material, {{to a depth of}} a few inches. A ring of rocks is sometimes constructed around a fire. Fire rings, however, do not fully protect material on the ground from catching fire. Flying embers are still a threat, and the fire ring may become hot enough to ignite material in contact with it, or the rocks could crack.|$|E
