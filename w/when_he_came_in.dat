5|$|While having name recognition, McGovern {{had little}} funding or staff, {{although}} he did garner critical funding from some celebrities and statesmen. He won a surprise third-place showing in the Iowa caucuses amidst a crowded field of candidates, but finished fifth in the New Hampshire primary. He announced he would drop out unless he finished first or second in the Massachusetts primary, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> third behind his former campaign manager Gary Hart and former Vice President Walter Mondale, he made good on his promise. He later endorsed Mondale, the eventual Democratic nominee. McGovern hosted Saturday Night Live on April 14, 1984.|$|E
5|$|Bowling {{a mixture}} of medium pace and his new style of off spin, Macaulay played 27 matches in 1921. After taking wickets {{steadily}} {{at the start of}} the season, in his fourth game he took six wickets for ten runs as Warwickshire were bowled out for 72. Four more wickets in the second innings gave Yorkshire a big victory and Macaulay had match figures of ten wickets for 65 runs, the first time he had taken ten wickets in a match. Macaulay then came to wider public attention by taking six wickets for three runs to bowl out Derbyshire for 23 runs. He later took ten wickets in the match against Surrey in a losing cause, and in total that season he took 101 first-class wickets at an average of 17.33, placing him third in the Yorkshire bowling averages. With the bat, he scored 457 runs at an average of 22.59, surprising commentators with his ability. This included a maiden first-class century against Nottinghamshire. His innings of 125 not out took Yorkshire from 211 for seven wickets <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> to bat (228 for eight soon after) to a total of 438 for nine declared, a lead of 264; Yorkshire went on to a comfortable win. His overall success in the season meant that his place in the team was secure.|$|E

25|$|Born in Christ Church, Barbados, King {{played as}} an all-rounder, but had more {{success with the}} bat than ball, {{especially}} in Test cricket, where he scored one century and two fifties but only took three wickets – in three different innings.

25|$|The Treaty of Passarowitz, {{by which}} Serbia {{north of the}} West Morava was ceded from the Ottoman Empire to the Habsburg Monarchy, was signed on 21July 1718.

Shortly before the treaty was signed, Stefan returned to Ravanica and renovated the monastery, which had been half-ruined and overgrown with vegetation <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came.</b> <b>In</b> 1733, there were only five monks in Ravanica. Serbia was returned to the Ottoman Empire in 1739, but the monastery was not completely abandoned this time.|$|E

25|$|Max Berfelde, Lothar's father, {{was already}} {{a member of the}} Nazi Party by the late 1920s and he had become a party leader in Mahlsdorf. In 1942 he forced Lothar to join the Hitler Youth.

Max demanded that Lothar choose between parents, threatening her with a gun and leaving her in a room with an hour to choose; <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> to kill her, she struck him with a rolling pin and killed him. In January 1945, after several weeks in a psychiatric institution, Lothar was sentenced by a court in Berlin to four years detention as an anti-social juvenile delinquent.

25|$|On {{the first}} lap of the British Grand Prix, which Irvine {{finished}} in second place, Schumacher broke {{his right leg}} in a crash at the high-speed Stowe Corner when his car's rear brakes failed.

In September it was announced that Irvine would move to the Jaguar team, which had purchased Stewart Grand Prix in June, and would be partnered by Johnny Herbert. Irvine finished out of the points in seventh place at the European Grand Prix after enduring an embarrassing 48-second pitstop while his mechanics searched for a missing tyre as they only had three ready for him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
