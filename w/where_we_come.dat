A common misconception about Bolles is that they recruit and their teams are composed of blue-chip college prospects. They usually aren’t, so Rogers must maximize the potential of players with no chance of ever playing college ball. Rogers stated, [...] "As coaches, we don't {{do a lot to}} make Division I football players; they pretty much make themselves. <b>Where</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> in is to have more influence on the guy who struggles just to be competitive." ...|$|E

In Europe we have to proceed differently. The path to opportunism has to be barred ... Opportunism among us is the utilisation of bourgeois institutions in the economic domain ... The Russian comrades are not supermen either, and they need a counterweight, and this counterweight must be a IIIrd International ridding itself of any tactic of compromise, parliamentarism and the old unions.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Seeger died at New York-Presbyterian Hospital on January 27, 2014, {{at the age}} of 94. Response and {{reaction}} to Seeger's death quickly poured in. President Barack Obama noted that Seeger had been called [...] "America's tuning fork" [...] and that he believed in [...] "the power of song" [...] to bring social change, [...] "Over the years, Pete used his voice and his hammer to strike blows for workers' rights and civil rights; world peace and environmental conservation, and he always invited us to sing along. For reminding us <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> from and showing us where we need to go, we will always be grateful to Pete Seeger." [...] Folksinger and fellow activist Billy Bragg wrote that: [...] "Pete believed that music could make a difference. Not change the world, he never claimed that – he once said that if music could change the world he'd only be making music – but he believed that while music didn't have agency, it did have the power to make a difference." [...] Bruce Springsteen said of Seeger's death, [...] "I lost a great friend and a great hero last night, Pete Seeger", before performing [...] "We Shall Overcome" [...] while on tour in South Africa.|$|E

2500|$|Arlo Guthrie {{uses the}} epithet in his 1967 {{signature}} song [...] "Alice's Restaurant". noting it {{as a potential}} way to avoid military induction at the time (Guthrie has removed the word from live performances of the song in the 21st century). The Dire Straits 1985 song [...] "Money for Nothing" [...] makes notable use of the epithet faggot, although the lines containing it are often excised for radio play, and in live performances by singer/songwriter Mark Knopfler. The song was banned from airplay by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council in 2011 but the ban was reversed later the same year. In 1989, Sebastian Bach, lead singer of the band Skid Row, created a controversy when he wore a T-shirt with the parody slogan [...] "Aids: Kills Fags Dead". The 2001 song [...] "American Triangle" [...] by Elton John and Bernie Taupin uses the phrase God hates fags <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> from. The song is about Matthew Shepard, a Wyoming man who was killed because he was gay. The 2007 song The Bible Says, which includes the line [...] "God Hates Fags" [...] (sometimes used as an alternate title) caused considerable controversy when it was published on various websites. Apparently an anti-gay song written and performed by an ex-gay pastor [...] "Donnie Davies", it was accompanied by the realistic Love God's Way website about his [...] "ministry". Debate ensued about whether Donnie Davies and the outrageous song, which included a few double entendres, were for real, and whether the lyrics could ever be considered acceptable even in satire. Donnie Davies was revealed in 2007 to be a character played by actor and entertainer. Some gay rights advocates acknowledge that as a spoof it is humorous, but claim the message behind it is still as malicious as someone who seriously possessed the opinion. In December 2007, BBC Radio 1 caused controversy by editing the word faggot from their broadcasts of the Kirsty MacColl & The Pogues song [...] "Fairytale of New York", deeming it potentially homophobic; however, the edit did not extend to other BBC stations, such as BBC Radio 2. Following widespread criticism and pressure from listeners, the decision was reversed and the original unedited version of the song was reinstated, with clarification from Andy Parfitt, the station controller, that {{in the context of}} the song the lyrics had no [...] "negative intent". Patty Griffin uses the word faggot in her song [...] "Tony" [...] about a classmate of hers from high school who committed suicide.|$|E

Not a ship would leave any port in the United Kingdom, not a ship would be docked. Forty-eight hours of this would do more harm than a year's civil war.
