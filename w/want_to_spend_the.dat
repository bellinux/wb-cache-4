25|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, Bethlehem Steel {{allowed the}} Lackawanna Steel plant to become obsolete. Foreign {{competition}} made it financially impossible {{to continue to}} manufacture most of the products produced at Lackawanna. Bethlehem Steel also disliked the high tax rates {{of the state of}} New York, and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> millions of dollars in air and water pollution abatement which were required by state and federal authorities. The company built a new facility in Burns Harbor, Indiana, and stopped investing in new steel production methods at Lackawanna.|$|E
25|$|Pat Johnson {{remained}} {{convinced of}} the validity of the idea, and had Whittle patent the idea in January 1930. Since the RAF was not interested in the concept they did not declare it secret, meaning that Whittle was able to retain the rights to the idea, which would have otherwise been their property. Johnson arranged a meeting with British Thomson-Houston (BTH), whose chief turbine engineer seemed to agree with the basic idea. However, BTH did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> ₤60,000 it would cost to develop it, and this potential brush with early success went no further.|$|E

There's this fighter in me that kind of needs to be put to rest a little bit. I don't need to be so tough to protect myself." [...] While speaking to Vanity Fair at the premiere of her film Obsessed, Larter spoke about her own obsessions, [...] "I love to cook. I spend weekends reading cookbooks—it's really my relaxation." [...] She has ranked Scarface, The Bourne Identity, Best in Show, Blue Sky and Grey Gardens as her favorite films.|$|E

500|$|H. R. Giger {{designed}} {{and worked on}} all of the alien aspects of the film, which he designed to appear organic and biomechanical in contrast to the industrial look of the Nostromo and its human elements. For the interior of the derelict spacecraft and egg chamber he used dried bones together with plaster to sculpt much of the scenery and elements. Veronica Cartwright described Giger's sets as [...] "so erotic...it's big vaginas and penises...the whole thing is like you're going inside of some sort of womb or whatever...it's sort of visceral". The set with the deceased alien creature, which the production team nicknamed the [...] "space jockey", proved problematic as 20th Century Fox did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> money for such an expensive set that would only be used for one scene. Ridley Scott described the set as the cockpit or driving deck of the mysterious ship, and the production team was able to convince the studio that the scene was important to impress the audience and make them aware {{that this was not a}} B movie. To save money, only one wall of the set was created, and the [...] "space jockey" [...] sat atop a disc that could be rotated to facilitate shots from different angles in relation to the actors. Giger airbrushed the entire set and the [...] "space jockey" [...] by hand.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Lundgren {{directed}} {{and starred in}} the Mongolia-based action adventure, Diamond Dogs. Lundgren portrays the character of Xander Ronson, a mercenary hired {{by a group of}} American fortune hunters to act as their guide and bodyguard, while they search for a priceless Buddhist artifact deep within the Chinese wilderness. They get more than they bargained for, however, as they {{come face to face with}} Russian mercenaries also after the artifact. The film, a Canadian-Chinese production, was shot on location in Inner Mongolia. Later in 2007, Lundgren wrote, {{directed and}} starred in Missionary Man alongside Charles Solomon Jr.. Described as a [...] "modern western" [...] by Lundgren, He plays a lone, Bible-preaching stranger named Ryder who comes into a small Texas town on his 1970's Harley-Davidson motorcycle to attend the funeral of his good friend J.J., a local Native American carpenter, only to later get mixed up in a series of brawls with a local gang. According to Lundgren, it had long been a desire of his to direct a western, having long been a fan of Clint Eastwood and John Wayne, yet he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> time and money building an old western town and hiring horses, so decided to set it in modern times with a motorbike instead of entering the town on a horse in the manner than Clint Eastwood would. Lundgren's co-writer, Frank Valdez's wife's brother happened to be a notable actor working in Texas and invited Lundgren's team to shoot there. The film was shot on location in Waxahachie, a southern suburb of Dallas and was produced by Andrew Stevens and it was specially screened at the 2008 AFI Dallas Film Festival.|$|E

2500|$|The Arch {{was planned}} for the world {{exhibition}} of 1880 and was meant to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the independence of Belgium. [...] In 1880, only the bases of the columns were completed and, during the exhibition, {{the rest of the}} arch was constructed from wooden panels. [...] During the following years, the completion of the monument was the topic of a continuous battle between King Leopold II and the Belgian government, which did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> money required to complete it.|$|E

[...] Fox said that she had been reluctant to come out because, having already dealt with obsessed fans and stalkers, she feared fans' possible reactions. In 2009, she announced her plans to form a civil partnership with Stratton.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, his {{autobiography}} and art book, I <b>Want</b> <b>To</b> <b>Spend</b> <b>the</b> Rest of My Life Everywhere, with Everyone, One to One, Always, Forever, Now, was published. With Alex James {{of the band}} Blur and actor Keith Allen, he formed the band Fat Les, achieving a number 2 hit with a raucous football-themed song Vindaloo, followed up by Jerusalem with the London Gay Men's Chorus. Hirst also painted a simple colour pattern for the Beagle 2 probe. This pattern was {{to be used to}} calibrate the probe's cameras after it had landed on Mars. He turned down the British Council's invitation to be the UK's representative at the 1999 Venice Biennale because [...] "it didn't feel right".

2500|$|In 1994, Unger {{transformed}} the Trans Hudson Gallery into a vault of concrete shapes that look {{almost like the}} remains of giants. [...] Included in the show was Across the Bering Strait, a work that occupied Unger {{for two years before}} it was exhibited. [...] The sculpture is a crowd of shapes that are phallic, intuitive, and sausage-like, laid as if thrown onto its stubby supports. [...] The theme is migration and, according to Unger, the title refers to the Mongol migration across the land bridge between Asia and Alaska. [...] The cradles that hold the elongated forms were seen as immigrants’ bundled possessions, tent poles, and primitive life forms, while the work speaks on a deeper level about individual movement and the cycle of life. [...] For art reviewer Vivien Raynor, however, it brought up visions of mutilation and monstrous fungi proliferating in caves. [...] Raynor described it as a show that one would not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> night with.|$|E
2500|$|Hirst's {{first major}} {{international}} presentation {{was in the}} Venice Biennale in 1993 with the work, Mother and Child Divided, a cow and a calf cut into sections and exhibited {{in a series of}} separate vitrines. He curated the show Some Went Mad, Some Ran Away in 1994 at the Serpentine Gallery in London, where he exhibited Away from the Flock (a sheep in a tank of formaldehyde). On 9 May, Mark Bridger, a 35-year-old artist from Oxford, walked into the gallery and poured black ink into the tank, and retitled the work Black Sheep. [...] He was subsequently prosecuted, at Hirst's wish, and was given two years' probation. The sculpture was restored at a cost of £1,000. When a photograph of Away from the Flock was reproduced in the 1997 book by Hirst I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>the</b> rest of my life everywhere, with everyone, one-to-one, always, forever, now, the vandalism was referenced by allowing the tank to be obscured by pulling a card, reproducing the effect of ink being poured into the tank; this resulted in Hirst being sued by Bridger for violating his copyright on Black Sheep.|$|E
