500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV, Usher commented that lyrically, 8701 represents his [...] "soul", and elaborated by explaining that he was inspired by love and heartache; [...] "I listen {{to a lot of}} Donny Hathaway's, Stevie Wonder's, Marvin Gaye's and Michael Jackson's earlier records, those Motown greats. There's a little bit of all of that in the album. I really appreciate what music was back then {{as well as in the}} early '90s <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> artists like Troop and Jodeci, and Michael Jackson was in his prime." [...] Usher explained that the album's lyrics also reflect on what has been going on with his relationship; 8701 is predominantly an R album.

There were two sets of [...] "bones", and two sets of sticks, numbering from 7-11 for each team. When a game was in play, one team had two sets of [...] "bones". When your team was guessing, your objective {{was to get the}} right bone, the one without the stripe. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> the bones, your objective was to make sure the other team guessed wrong on the bones set. When the other team guessed wrong, you gained a point. When a team had the two sets of bones, two individuals hid the bones and swapped them around from hand to hand. Eventually the bones were brought forward, but were concealed as to show the other team which one had a stripe on it. The game was usually accompanied by drumming and singing, used to boost the morale of the team. The side that had the bone sings, while the other tried to guess. Musical accompaniment was also sometimes used to taunt the other team. Gambling could be done by players, or spectators of a match. Placing bets on teams, or individual matches within the game between one guess and the other teams bone hiders.|$|E
