5|$|As <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> {{many of his}} contemporaries, Miller's {{sporting}} {{career was}} interrupted by World War II. On 20 August 1940, {{towards the end of}} the football season, almost a year after war broke out, Miller joined the Militia (army reserve), and was assigned to the 4th Reserve Motor Transport Company.|$|E

50|$|ALJs can {{administer}} oaths, take testimony, rule {{on questions}} of evidence, and make factual and legal determinations. And depending upon the agency's jurisdiction, proceedings may have complex multi-party adjudication, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or simplified and less formal procedures, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Social Security Administration.|$|R
5|$|After Pather Panchali, Ray {{went on to}} make 36 more films, {{including}} feature films, documentaries and shorts. He {{worked on}} scripting, casting, scoring, cinematography, art direction and editing, as well as designing his own credit titles and publicity material. He developed a distinctive style of film-making based, as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> Pather Panchali, on visual lyricism and strongly humanistic themes. Thus, Ray established himself as an internationally recognized auteur of cinema.|$|E
5|$|As <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> {{almost all}} German capital ships during World War I, Moltkes action was {{somewhat}} limited. However, she did participate {{in most of}} the major fleet actions conducted by the High Seas Fleet. At the start of the war, the ship was assigned to the I Scouting Group of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Franz Hipper.|$|E
5|$|As <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> his grandfather, Sultan Ibrahim, Sultan Iskandar's {{independent}} mindset {{resulted in}} strained {{relations with the}} Malaysian federal government on numerous occasions. This was more so during his days as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, whereby a number of notable public incidents involved Sultan Iskandar. Nevertheless, Sultan Iskandar was reputed to show great concern to his subjects, and was held in high esteem by many of his subjects–particularly the Malays and Orang Aslis.|$|E

50|$|The EN 15038 {{standard}} {{not only}} introduces requirements for compliance with certain common procedures, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> ISO 9001, but also s the processes especially {{developed for the}} overall execution of the translation - from acceptance of the order to delivery. Also, EN 15038 certifies the translation service and not the process management, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> ISO 9001.|$|R
5|$|As <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> many of Heinlein's books, Starship Troopers was {{completed}} in a few weeks. It was originally written as a juvenile novel for New York publishing house Scribner; Heinlein had previously had success with this format, having written several such novels published by Scribner. The manuscript was rejected, prompting Heinlein to end his association with the publisher completely, and resume writing books with adult themes. Scholars have suggested that Scribner's rejection was based on ideological objections {{to the content of}} the novel, particularly its treatment of military conflict.|$|E
5|$|As <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> {{most of his}} works, Etty did {{not give}} the {{painting}} a title. It was initially exhibited as A Composition, taken from the Eleventh Book of Milton's Paradise Lost, and was referred to by Etty himself as The Bevy of Fair Women and The Origin of Marriage. By 1862, when it was shown at the International Exhibition, it had acquired its present title.|$|E
5|$|Composer Richard Strauss was {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Reichsmusikkammer (Reich Music Chamber) on its founding in November 1933. As <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> other art forms, the Nazis ostracised musicians who were deemed racially unacceptable {{and for the most}} part disapproved of music that was too modern or atonal. Jazz was considered especially inappropriate and foreign jazz musicians left the country or were expelled. Hitler favoured the music of Richard Wagner, especially pieces based on Germanic myths and heroic stories and attended the Bayreuth Festival each year from 1933.|$|E

5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{reproduction}} most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. Fejervarya raja) can inhabit brackish water, {{but there are no}} true marine amphibians. There are reports, however, of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters. Such <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> the Black Sea invasion of the natural hybrid Pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010.|$|E
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Fey starred {{alongside}} Paul Rudd in {{the romantic}} comedy-drama film Admission, {{based on the}} Jean Hanff Korelitz novel by the same name. The film was directed by Paul Weitz. Fey later starred in the 2014 comedy-drama This Is Where I Leave You, helmed by Date Night director Shawn Levy. As <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> Baby Mama, although both of these films received generally mixed reviews, Fey's performances were well received by film critics.|$|E

5|$|To {{prepare the}} dead for the afterlife, the mummies were {{surrounded}} with ceramic pots containing food, tunjos and cotton bags and mantles. The guecha warriors were richly venerated with golden arms, crowns, emeralds and cotton. When the caciques and zaque and zipa died, their mummified bodies {{were placed in}} mausoleums and surrounded with golden objects. The highest regarded members of society were accompanied by their many wives, by slaves and their children. The mummy of a baby described from a cave in Gámeza, Boyacá, had a teether around the neck. Other mummies of children were richly decorated with gold and placed in caves, as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> a young girl described by Liborio Zerda.|$|E
5|$|Turkish {{nationalism}} and secularism {{were two of}} the six founding principles of the Turkish Republic. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the leader of {{the early decades of the}} Republic, aimed to create a nation state (Turkish: Ulus) from the Turkish remnants of the Ottoman Empire. During the first three decades of the Republic, efforts to Turkify geographical names were a recurring theme. Imported maps containing references to historical regions such as Armenia, Kurdistan, or Lazistan (the official name of the province of Rize until 1921) were prohibited (as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> Der Grosse Weltatlas, a map published in Leipzig).|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the classic}} {{era of the}} series that ended in 1989, the plan with the new series was to have each episode as a {{standalone}} story, with no serials. Of the thirteen episodes in the series, seven of them followed this format; the remaining six were grouped together into three two-part stories. Also, {{for the first time}} since The Gunfighters in the third season, each episode was given an individual title, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> the standalone and two-part stories.|$|E

5|$|Ways of life {{often viewed}} as more rigid, such as {{soldiers}} and religious cultures, frequently have explicit rules regarding hair length. For example, Buddhist monks shave their heads {{as part of their}} order of worship. Similarly, religious men with long hair include the Nazarites of the Hebrew Bible (Samson being a famous example) and the Sikhs. Subservient cultures may view male long hair negatively, and are sometimes detected by their rulers through hair length, as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> the Gaelic Irish under English rule and the Moors under Spanish rule in Medieval Spain.|$|E
5|$|When first {{described}} in 1924, Velociraptor {{was placed in}} the family Megalosauridae, as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> most carnivorous dinosaurs at the time (Megalosauridae, like Megalosaurus, functioned as a sort of 'wastebin' taxon, where many unrelated species were grouped together). As dinosaur discoveries multiplied, Velociraptor was later recognized as a dromaeosaurid. All dromaeosaurids have also been referred to the family Archaeopterygidae by at least one author (which would, in effect, make Velociraptor a flightless bird).|$|E
5|$|While {{designing}} Oblivions {{landscape and}} architecture, developers worked from personal travel photographs, nature books, texture images, and reference photographs. Procedural content generation tools used in production {{allowed for the}} creation of realistic environments at much faster rates than <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> Morrowind. Erosion algorithms incorporated in the landscape generation tools allowed {{for the creation of}} craggy terrain quickly and easily, replacing Morrowinds artificially smoothed-over terrain.|$|E
