25|$|Tuonela was {{the land}} of dead. It was an {{underground}} home or city for all the dead people, not only the good or the bad ones.

25|$|In 1906 Estrada faced serious revolts {{against his}} rule; the rebels were {{supported}} by the governments {{of some of the}} other Central American nations, but Estrada succeeded in putting them down.

25|$|Adherents of {{different}} religions generally disagree {{as to how}} to best worship God and what is God's plan for mankind, if there is one. There are different approaches to reconciling the contradictory claims of monotheistic religions. One view is taken by exclusivists, who believe they are the chosen people or have exclusive access to absolute truth, generally through revelation or encounter with the Divine, which adherents of other religions do not. Another view is religious pluralism. A pluralist typically believes that his religion is the right one, but does not deny the partial truth of other religions. An example of a pluralist view in Christianity is supersessionism, i.e., the belief that one's religion is the fulfillment of previous religions. A third approach is relativistic inclusivism, <b>where</b> <b>everybody</b> is seen as equally right; an example being universalism: the doctrine that salvation is eventually available for everyone. A fourth approach is syncretism, mixing different elements from different religions. An example of syncretism is the New Age movement.|$|E

Michael forms {{an obsession with}} dolphins and paints them all over his house, the street plan of Hillside is shown to form {{the shape of a}} dolphin {{at the end of the}} film. Nathan Baran of Hybrid Magazine was frustrated by the lack of explanation of the motif, saying: [...] "Never are dolphins discussed by anyone else to have any meaning whatsoever. [...] What is the significance of the dolphin as an image? [...] it is a completely arbitrary image awkwardly stuffed with forced meaning". Posin saw Hillside's formation of a dolphin shape as [...] "beauty and order to the chaos", illustrating Michael's belief in deep beauty <b>where</b> <b>everybody</b> else finds chaos.|$|E

He marvels at the school ("Get High" [...] with principal Martin Nett), the business district (home of Walter Wall Rugs) and the university (where he finds the intellectual Noel Lott). He finishes up at a restaurant (Chef Al Dente), the hospital (Carson Oma, M.D.) and finally the town cemetery (Last resting place of Dustin Toodust).|$|R

500|$|Bart's rebellious nature, which {{frequently}} {{resulted in}} no punishment for his misbehavior, led some parents and conservatives to characterize {{him as a}} poor role model for children. Robert Bianco of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that [...] " [...] outwits his parents and outtalks his teachers; in short, he's the child we wish we'd been, and fear our children will become." [...] In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a [...] "threat to learning" [...] because of his [...] "underachiever and proud of it" [...] attitude and negative attitude regarding his education. Others described him as [...] "egotistical, aggressive and mean-spirited." [...] In response to the criticism, James L. Brooks said, [...] "I'm very wary of television <b>where</b> <b>everybody</b> {{is supposed to be}} a role model, you don't run across that many role models in real life.

500|$|The {{show was}} {{controversial}} from its beginning. The rebellious lead character at the time, Bart, frequently received no punishment for his misbehavior, which led some parents and conservatives to characterize {{him as a}} poor role model for children.

In the season two opening episode [...] "Bart Gets an F", Bart fails four consecutive history exams and the school psychiatrist recommends that Bart repeat the fourth grade. Several critics thought that the episode [...] "Bart Gets an F" [...] {{was a response to}} these controversies. However, Brooks denied that it was a response and added, [...] "we're mindful of it. I do think it's important for us that Bart does badly in school. There are students like that. Besides, I'm very wary of television <b>where</b> <b>everybody</b> {{is supposed to be a}} role model.

500|$|Tony! Toni! Toné! took a hiatus {{as a group}} {{after the}} {{commercial}} and critical success of their 1993 album Sons of Soul. According to vocalist and bassist Raphael Wiggins, each member had pursued individual music projects, and [...] "the group {{was trying to figure}} out <b>where</b> <b>everybody's</b> time, space and head was at." [...] He, D'wayne Wiggins, and Timothy Christian Riley worked on songwriting and production for other recording artists during the band's hiatus, including D'Angelo, En Vogue, Karyn White, Tevin Campbell, and A Tribe Called Quest. Raphael Wiggins adopted the surname [...] "Saadiq" [...] for his professional name in 1994—"man of his word" [...] in Arabic—and released his solo single [...] "Ask of You" [...] in 1995. Their work outside the band led to rumors of a break-up during the time between albums. Tony! Toni! Toné! eventually regrouped and began recording House of Music in September 1995.|$|R

30|$|This {{mention of}} antiauthoritarianism brings the {{discussion}} {{over to the}} central moral point from which this model has arisen. This point advocates creative chaos, anarchy in a truest sense of the word, as a pathway to the most prolific classroom experience. Directing people toward a specific action or a thought process is inherently authoritarian and toxic as such, the solution to which may be a learning setting <b>where</b> <b>everybody’s</b> opinion resonates with equal relevance. Paralleling the co-creative involvement of every class attendee is the necessity {{to be out of}} compliance with the syllabus for most of the time. To be ready to depart from a prefabbed blueprint for our actions, including a preconceived syllabus, is to foster a wide-awake perception among the class participants and open broader gateways for the inflow of creative thought than possible in an authoritarian classroom where off-script activities are strongly prohibited and everything proceeds inertly, in a preplanned manner.|$|R
