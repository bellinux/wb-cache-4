5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered {{to the ends of the}} earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E
500|$|In a four-star review, Allmusic editor Alex Henderson called Coltrane for Lovers [...] "an {{excellent}} {{collection that}} has no problem reminding us just how warm and expressive his ballad playing could be." [...] After discussing how Coltrane's ballad-playing has been undervalued in comparison to his more experimental recordings, in a December 21, 2001 article for The New York Times, writer Ben Ratliff wrote that [...] "This collection ... presents all the argument you need." [...] Some, however, have criticized the album and Verve negatively for repackaging Coltrane material for an unnecessary cash-in compilation. In [...] The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD, Richard Cook and Brian Morton gave the album {{one out of four}} stars and commented, [...] "Oh, for goodness' sake! We're tempted to tell you that this contains a previously unreleased rehearsal of Ascension, which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> regarded as excellent make-out music, but it does not. Needless to say, the music is fine ... It's the concept we have problems with. Avoid." ...|$|E
500|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin {{also created}} great {{interest}} in the United Kingdom. The first London edition appeared in May 1852 and sold 200,000 copies. Some of this interest was because of British antipathy to America. As one prominent writer explained, [...] "The evil passions which Uncle Tom gratified in England were not hatred or vengeance , but national jealousy and national vanity. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> been smarting under the conceit of America—we are tired of hearing her boast {{that she is the}} freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen. Our clergy hate her voluntary system—our Tories hate her democrats—our Whigs hate her parvenus—our Radicals hate her litigiousness, her insolence, and her ambition. All parties hailed Mrs. Stowe as a revolter from the enemy." [...] Charles Francis Adams, the American minister to Britain during the war, argued later that [...] "Uncle Tom's Cabin; or Life among the Lowly, published in 1852, exercised, largely from fortuitous circumstances, a more immediate, considerable and dramatic world-influence than any other book ever printed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{have argued}} that Gore refuses to debate the topic of global warming. Bjørn Lomborg asked him to debate the topic {{at a conference in}} California. Gore replied that he would not, stating that [...] "The {{scientific}} community has gone through this chapter and verse. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> since passed the time when we should pretend this is a ‘on the one hand, on the other hand’ issue,” he said. “It’s not a matter of theory or conjecture, for goodness sake." ...|$|E
2500|$|Volunteer {{investigators}} {{working under}} the direction of Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio have asserted that Obama's birth certificate is a computer-generated forgery. Rejecting this claim, an assistant to Hawaii's attorney general stated in July 2012 that [...] "President Obama was born in Honolulu, and his birth certificate is valid.... Regarding the latest allegations from a sheriff in Arizona, they are untrue, misinformed and misconstrue Hawaii law." [...] Arizona state officials, including Governor Jan Brewer and Secretary of State Ken Bennett, have also dismissed Arpaio's objections and accepted the validity of Obama's birth certificate. Alex Pareene, a staff writer for Salon, wrote regarding a May 2012 trip to Hawaii by Arpaio's people that [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> since passed the point at which I'd find this story believable in a fictional setting". In December 2016, Arpaio presented [...] "9 points of forgery" [...] that he said proved that the digital image of Obama's long form birth certificate was not authentic. He planned to turn his conclusions over to federal authorities.|$|E

2500|$|In general matters, however, section 74 did {{not prevent}} the Privy Council from {{granting}} leave to appeal against the High Court's wishes and the Council did so often. In some cases the Council acknowledged that the Australian common law had developed differently from English law and thus did not apply its own principles (for example, in Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Uren (1967), or in Viro v The Queen (1978)), by using a legal fiction that stated that different common law can apply to different circumstances. However, in other cases, the Privy Council enforced English decisions, over-ruling decisions by the High Court. In Parker v The Queen (1963), Chief Justice Sir Owen Dixon led a unanimous judgment that rejected a precedent of the House of Lords in DPP v Smith saying, [...] "I shall not depart from the law on this matter as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>long</b> since laid it down in this Court and I think that Smith's case {{should not be used}} in Australia as authority at all"; the following year the Privy Council upheld an appeal, applying the House of Lords precedent.|$|E
