5|$|In 1942, {{on his way}} {{to visit}} his wife at the cottage where she was cared for by a devoted couple, Richardson crashed his motor-bike and was in {{hospital}} for several weeks. Kit <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> mobile enough to visit him, but later in the year her condition worsened and in October she died. He was intensely lonely, though the comradeship of naval life was some comfort. In 1944 he married again. His second wife was the actress Meriel Forbes, a member of the Forbes-Robertson theatrical family. The marriage brought him lifelong happiness and a son, Charles (1945–98), who became a television stage manager.|$|E
5|$|In October, Carlsen {{successfully}} {{defended his}} {{title in the}} FIDE World Rapid Championships held in Berlin, as the first World Rapid Champion {{to do so in}} history, going +8–0=7. He reached the highest live rapid rating in history after the tournament, and <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> ranked No. 1 in all three disciplines simultaneously. However, Carlsen lost his No. 1 blitz ranking after he had a weak second day in the World Blitz Championship, and was unable to retain his World Blitz Champion title, losing it to Alexander Grischuk.|$|E

5|$|In {{support of}} this album, Bowie {{embarked}} on the Glass Spider Tour, a world tour that <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> the biggest, most theatrical and most elaborate tour he had undertaken in his career. The tour, like the album it supported, was commercially successful but critically panned. The critical failure of the album and tour were factors that led Bowie {{to look for a}} new way to motivate himself creatively, leading him to create the band Tin Machine in 1989 and to retire his back catalogue from live performances during his 1990 Sound+Vision Tour. Bowie did not release another solo album until Black Tie White Noise in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{became known}} to Western scholars {{as a result}} of correspondence between Erasmus and the prefects of the Vatican Library. Portions of the codex were collated by several scholars, but numerous errors were made during this process. The Codex's relationship to the Latin Vulgate was unclear and scholars were initially unaware of the Codex's value. This changed in the 19th century when transcriptions of the full codex were completed. It <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> that scholars realised the text differed significantly from the Textus Receptus.|$|E
5|$|Young's {{first full}} season {{was not a}} {{successful}} one for Manchester City; the team struggled to find form throughout. A four match unbeaten run in April, in which Young scored a winning goal against Bolton Wanderers, gave hope, but {{on the final day}} of the season Manchester City were relegated to the Second Division. For the following two seasons Young continued to be a regular first team player, though he missed the first two months of the 1964–65 season. Manchester City did not come close to promotion, and their 11th-place finish in 1965 <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> the lowest in the club's history. Manager George Poyser departed in April 1965, and in July 1965 his replacement, Joe Mercer, joined the club, along with coach Malcolm Allison.|$|E
50|$|By 1939 {{the need}} to protect {{merchant}} ships from mines which might be laid round the coast was becoming increasingly apparent. There <b>were,</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> 78 officers and 610 ratings active in the New Zealand Division of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.|$|R

5|$|The vacancy {{may also}} have {{occurred}} because Wilfrid, who <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> having problems in Northumbria, desired to become Archbishop of Canterbury. A contemporary biographer of Wilfrid, Stephen of Ripon, says that Theodore had wished for Wilfrid to succeed Theodore at Canterbury. Æthelred of Mercia may have supported Wilfrid's translation to Canterbury also, but despite these desires, the translation did not happen. Berhtwald was consecrated on 29 June 693, having travelled to France for his consecration as archbishop of Canterbury by Godwin, Archbishop of Lyon. Berhtwald went to the continent for consecration probably because he feared that his election was not supported {{by all of the}} kings and bishops. After his consecration, Berhtwald travelled to Rome to obtain the support of Pope Sergius I, who wrote to a number of Anglo-Saxon kings and bishops in support of the archbishop. Two of these letters survive, and their authenticity has been doubted, mainly because they are only preserved as part of the post-Norman Conquest Canterbury-York dispute. Historians have since come to regard the two letters as genuine. Sergius also gave Berhtwald a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority.|$|E
5|$|While Keats had {{remained}} with his prize Saumarez {{had led the}} remainder of the squadron forward, although Audacious had been left far behind the rest of the British force. The French and Spanish ships had scattered as Superb attacked the rearguard and during the night each made their way separately to the rendezvous off Cadiz harbour. As dawn broke at 04:00 on 13 July, lookouts on the leading British ship of the line Venerable under Captain Samuel Hood spotted the French ship Formidable, under the command of Captain Amable Troude in the absence of Linois, to the north. Formidable was trailing the rest of the squadron, close to the shore in Conil Bay to the south of Cadiz and north of Cape Trafalgar. The wind was light and coming from the land and so Caesar and Spencer, the latter being a long way behind the others, were unable to approach the French ship and it was left to Venerable and Thames, both inshore and therefore better able {{to make use of the}} wind, to lead the attack. Formidable had only jury topmasts following the battle on 6 July, and so Hood was able to rapidly approach the French ship, coming under fire from Troude's stern guns at 05:15, Hood holding off from replying until 05:20 so as to not delay his progress. The light breeze <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> in Hood's favour, and Venerable was able to come close alongside Formidable and open fire with a full broadside. Off Cadiz, the remnants of Moreno's squadron formed up with the intention of sailing to Formidables aid, but were struck by a calm and could only watch the battle to the south.|$|E
25|$|On July 18, 2005, the AAMC {{announced}} that it would offer the paper-and-pencil version of the MCAT only through August 2006. A subset of testing sites offered a computer-based version of the full-length exam throughout 2005 and 2006. A shorter, computer-based version of the test debuted in January 2007. The exam <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> offered numerous times annually, and scored more quickly.|$|E

25|$|In {{the twelfth}} stage, Heusghem {{attacked}} Alavoine again. Alavoine punctured {{six times in}} that stage, which {{made it impossible for}} him to keep up with Heusghem. Heusghem won over 35 minutes on Alavoine, and more than 10 minutes on second-placed Lambot, which was enough to take over the lead. Heusghem <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> the strongest rider in the race, and seemed to be {{on the way to the}} overall victory in Paris.|$|E
25|$|The Edinburgh Street Tramways Company {{was founded}} in 1871, {{initially}} operating a horse-drawn tram line from Haymarket to Bernard Street in Leith, which <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> a separate burgh from Edinburgh. This company's routes inside Edinburgh itself were taken over by Edinburgh and District Tramways in 1893, while the Leith Burgh Corporation took over those routes within their own boundaries in 1904, running them as Leith Corporation Tramways, after which Edinburgh Street Tramways ceased to trade.|$|E
25|$|The Ciudadela was {{completed}} during the Miccaotli phase, and the Pyramid of the Sun underwent a complex series of additions and renovations. The Great Compound was constructed across the Avenue of the Dead, west of Ciudadela. This {{was probably the}} city’s marketplace. The existence of a large market in an urban center of this size is strong evidence of state organization. Teotihuacan <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> simply too large and too complex to have been politically viable as a chiefdom.|$|E

25|$|The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina {{was formed}} by the Washington Agreement of March 1994. Under the agreement, the {{combined}} territory held by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Defence Council forces was to be divided into ten autonomous cantons.

In the match, using his oddly shaped bat, he scored 142 not out, and it <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point</b> Joe decided to found The Woodworm Cricket Company, with its now famous shaped bats.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} feminists of the twentieth century, Friedan (in addition to many others) opposed equating feminism with lesbianism. As early as 1964, very early in the movement, and only a year after the publication of The Feminine Mystique, Friedan appeared on television to address the fact the media <b>was,</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> trying to dismiss the movement as a joke and centering argument and debate around whether or not to wear bras and other issues considered ridiculous. In 1982, during the second wave, she wrote a book for the post-feminist 1980s called The Second Stage, about family life, premised on women having conquered social and legal obstacles.|$|E

However, only McNabb and Daunte Culpepper would go on to have successful careers in the NFL; Tim Couch struggled with the Cleveland Browns and officially retired in 2007 after being cut by the Jacksonville Jaguars in a failed comeback bid, while Akili Smith and Cade McNown were out of the NFL by 2002. By 2006, only McNabb was still with the team that originally drafted him.|$|E
25|$|From {{the early}} 1970s Itoh {{was a major}} {{supplier}} of synthetic yarn (polyester) to India's Reliance Industries Limited.

With a $50 million for a 15 percent stake, it <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> the largest investment in India by a Japanese firm. Itoh also marketed products—under their own label—as diverse as a line of bicycles (mostly manufactured by Bridgestone), and computer printers.
