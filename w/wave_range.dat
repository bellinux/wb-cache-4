50|$|Since 1994, the {{transmitter}} uses as a transmission tower a 126.4 metre (414.6 ft) high guyed steel tube mast. The mast is guyed at 57 meters (187 ft) and 101.6 metres (333.2 ft) above ground.

50|$|Frequency {{multipliers}} {{are often}} used in frequency synthesizers and communications circuits. It can be more economical to develop a lower frequency signal with lower power and less expensive devices, and then use a frequency multiplier chain to generate an output frequency in the microwave or millimeter <b>wave</b> <b>range.</b> Some modulation schemes, such as frequency modulation, survive the nonlinear distortion without ill effect (but schemes such as amplitude modulation do not).|$|E
50|$|Since 1953 {{there has}} been a {{broadcasting}} facility for FM radio and television from regional broadcaster WDR near Kleve. It uses as aerial mast a 126.4 metre high guyed steel tube mast with a diameter of 1.6 metres, which is guyed 57 and 101.6 metres above ground. This mast replaced the old radio mast from the 1960s, which was used until 1993, additionally for transmissions in the medium <b>wave</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Ionosonde Juliusruh is a {{facility}} {{of the institute}} for atmospheric physics near Juliusruh in northeastern Germany for sounding the ionosphere with radar systems in the short <b>wave</b> <b>range</b> (frequencies between 1 MHz and 30 MHz). The landmark of the station is a 70 metre high grounded free standing steel framework tower, which was built in 1960/61 and which carries a cage aerial for the transmitter of the ionosonde.|$|E

50|$|Golant's {{research}} teams developed {{a novel approach}} to designing backward-wave tubes in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

50|$|Each DCO {{can produce}} triangle, sawtooth, a {{predefined}} mix of sawtooth and triangle, and rectangular waves. The pulse {{width of the}} rectangular <b>waves</b> <b>ranges</b> from 0 to 100%, and has a dedicated knob. The relative levels of the 2 DCOs is set with a balance knob.|$|R
50|$|LORAN-C chains were {{organized}} into the Master station, M, {{and up to}} five Secondary stations, V, W, X, Y, Z. All were broadcast at 100 kHz, a much lower frequency than earlier systems. The result was a signal that offered a daytime ground <b>wave</b> <b>range</b> of 2,250 miles, nighttime ground wave of 1,650 miles and skywaves out to 3,000 miles. Timing accuracy was estimated at 0.15 microseconds, offering accuracies {{on the order of}} 50 to 100 meters. In real-world use, the Coast Guard quoted absolute accuracy of 0.25 nautical miles, or better.|$|E
50|$|For {{broadcasting}} stations, directional antennas {{are often}} required. They consist of multiple masts, which often {{have the same}} height. Some longwave antennas consist of multiple mast antennas arranged in a circle {{with or without a}} mast antenna in the center. Such antennas focus the transmitted power toward ground and give a large zone of fade-free reception. This type of antenna is rarely used, because they are very expensive and require much space and because fading occurs on longwave much more rarely than in the medium <b>wave</b> <b>range.</b> One antenna of this kind was used by transmitter Orlunda in Sweden.|$|E
50|$|The {{epidermis}} {{has high}} electrical resistance for lower frequencies; at higher frequencies, the energy penetrates through by capacitive coupling. Damage to epidermis has low extent unless the epidermis is very moist. The characteristic depth for lower-frequency microwave injury is about 1 cm. The heating rate of adipose tissue is much slower than of muscle tissue. Frequencies in millimeter <b>wave</b> <b>range</b> are {{absorbed in the}} topmost layer of skin, rich in thermal sensors. At lower frequencies, between 1-10 GHz, most of the energy is however absorbed in deeper layers; the threshold for cellular injury there lies at 42 °C while the pain threshold is at 45 °C, so a subjective perception {{may not be a}} reliable indicator of a harmful level of exposure at those frequencies.|$|E
30|$|The {{transparency}} of the denuded amniotic membrane was investigated by recording percentage {{transmission of the}} electromagnetic <b>waves</b> <b>ranging</b> from 250 to 700  nm using a UV–visible spectrophotometer.

50|$|Sound that is {{perceptible}} {{by humans}} has frequencies from about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. In air at standard temperature and pressure, the corresponding wavelengths of sound <b>waves</b> <b>range</b> from 17 m to 17 mm.Sometimes speed and direction are combined as a velocity vector; wave number and direction are combined as a wave vector.|$|R
50|$|Transcranial {{alternating}} current stimulation applied over the visual cortex produces its effects depending upon frequency and illumination levels. When applied in an illuminated room, it induces most effectively {{the perception of}} continuously flickering light (phosphenes) with frequencies in the beta wave. But when in the dark such perception of flickering lights is most effective when the stimulation frequency when done in alpha <b>wave</b> <b>range.</b> The phosphenes are reported {{to be seen in}} the far peripheral areas of vision. This suggests that tACS stimulates the anterior part of the visual cortex on its medial wall where the peripheral areas of the visual field are processed. The reason for this could be that the current flows mostly in the cerebrospinal fluid between the two cerebral hemispheres and enters the cerebral cortex from the forward part of the visual cortex.|$|E
5000|$|The IEEE 1902.1-2009 {{standard}} is a wireless data communication protocol {{also known as}} RuBee, operates within the Low Frequency radio <b>wave</b> <b>range</b> of 30-900 kHz. Although very resistant to interference, metal, water and obstacles, it is very limited in range, usually only suitable for short-range networks under 70 feet. The baud rate is limited to 1,200 kB/s, making it a very low-rate communication network as well. This {{standard is}} aimed at the conception of wireless network of sensors and actuators in industrial and military environments. One of the major advantage 1902.1 tags is they are extremely low power and last for years (5-10) on a simple coin size battery {{and they can be}} sealed in a MIL STD 810G package. RuBee tags emit virtually no RF and do not produce any Compromising Emanations, as a result are used in high security facilities. RuBee tags are safe and in use near and on high explosive facilities.|$|E

40|$|The {{unwanted}} sound, noise, {{can lead}} to health problems, e. g. hearing loss and stress-related problems. A pre-knowledge of noise generation by machines is of great importance due to the ever-shorter product development cycles and stricter noise legislation. The noise from a machine radiates to the environment indirectly via the foundation structure and directly via the surrounding fluid. A fluid machine converts the energy from the fluid into mechanical energy or vice versa. Examples of the fluid machines are internal combustion engines (IC-engines), pumps, compressors, and fans. Predicting and controlling noise from a fluid machine requires {{a model of the}} noise sources themselves, i. e. acoustic source data. In the duct systems connected to the fluid machines, the acoustic source interacts strongly with the system boundaries, and the source characteristics must be described using in-duct methods. Above a certain frequency, i. e. first non-plane wave mode cut-on frequency, the sound pressure varies over the duct cross-section and non-plane waves are introduced. For a number of applications, the plane <b>wave</b> <b>range</b> dominates and the non-plane waves can be neglected. But for machines connected to large ducts, the non-plane <b>wave</b> <b>range</b> is also important. In the plane <b>wave</b> <b>range,</b> one-dimensional process simulation software can be used to predict, e. g. for IC-engines, the acoustic in-duct source characteristics. The high frequency phenomena with non-plane waves are so complicated, however, that it is practically impossible to simulate them accurately. Thus, in order to develop methods to estimate the sound produced, experimental studies are also essential. This thesis investigates the acoustic in-duct source characterization of fluid machines with applications to exhaust noise from medium speed IC-engines.   This corresponds to large engines used for power plants or on ships, for which the non-plane <b>wave</b> <b>range</b> also becomes important. The plane wave source characterization methods are extended into the higher frequency range with non-plane waves. In addition, methods to determine non-plane <b>wave</b> <b>range</b> damping for typical elements in exhaust systems, e. g. after-treatment devices, are discussed. QC 20151119 </p...|$|E
