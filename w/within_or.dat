Tumors {{occurring}} in the bile ducts within the liver {{are referred to as}} intrahepatic, those occurring in the ducts outside the liver are extrahepatic, and tumors occurring at the site where the bile ducts exit the liver may be referred to as perihilar. A cholangiocarcinoma occurring at the junction where the left and right hepatic ducts meet to form the common hepatic duct may be referred to eponymously as a Klatskin tumor.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban iguana is {{distributed}} throughout the rocky southern coastal areas of mainland Cuba and its surrounding islets with a feral population thriving on Isla Magueyes, Puerto Rico. A subspecies is found on the Cayman Islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. Females guard their nest sites and often nest in sites excavated by Cuban crocodiles. As a defense measure, the Cuban iguana often makes its home <b>within</b> <b>or</b> near prickly-pear cacti.|$|E
5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns <b>within</b> <b>or</b> near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} concerns, Aflaq kept quiet. But to his astonishment, keeping quiet {{caused him to}} lose his post as Secretary General – Aflaq was succeeded as Secretary General of the National Command by Munif al-Razzaz, a Jordanian of Syrian origin. However, the power between the two camps was {{unexpectedly}} reshuffled when Amin al-Hafiz defected to Aflaq's camp. In contrast to other military officers al-Hafiz had very little influence <b>within</b> <b>or</b> outside the party. Al-Hafiz's defection led to a resurgence of activity within Aflaq's faction, al-Bitar and Umran were brought back from Spain {{to form a new}} government.|$|E
5|$|Don't Look Now is {{also very}} well {{regarded}} by other industry professionals, placing in the top 100 on Sight & Sound's directors poll, run in tandem with their critics poll. A survey of 1000 people who work across the film and television industry, undertaken by the British Film Institute in 1999, saw the film ranked eighth on their list of top 100 British films of the 20th century. It also topped a similar list organised by Time Out London in 2011, in which 150 film industry professionals were polled. In 2012 Time Out also undertook a poll of the horror industry, {{in which more than}} 100 professionals who work <b>within</b> <b>or</b> have connections to the genre selected their favourite horror films, which saw Don't Look Now finish in twelfth position.|$|E
5|$|Each {{party in}} a coevolutionary {{relationship}} exerts selective pressures on the other, thereby affecting each other's evolution. Coevolution includes many forms of mutualism, host-parasite, and predator-prey relationships between species, as well as competition <b>within</b> <b>or</b> between species. In many cases, the selective pressures drive an evolutionary arms race between the species involved. Pairwise or specific coevolution, between exactly two species, {{is not the only}} possibility; in guild or diffuse coevolution, several species may evolve a trait in reciprocity with a trait in another species, as has happened between the flowering plants and pollinating insects such as bees, flies, and beetles.|$|E

Of that, $14.8million is granted from the National Park Service, and $13.5million from various sources including CERP, donations, and other grants. The entry fee for vehicles in 2006 ranged from $10 to $200 for bus tours. Of the nearly one million visitors to Everglades National Park in 2006, more than 38,000 were overnight campers, paying $16 a night or $10 a night for backcountry permits. Visitors spent $2.6 million within the park and $48million in local economies. More than 900jobs were sustained or created <b>within</b> <b>or</b> by the park, and the park added value of $35million to local economies.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} flank, {{north of the}} road, the North Koreans overran the {{battalion}} observation post and B Company's outpost line. This high ground changed hands three times during the day. While the infantry fight was in progress, and shortly after the first tank penetration, five more T-34s came around the road bend toward the US 71st Tank Battalion. Check had called for an air strike when the first tanks appeared. Three F-80 Shooting Stars arrived and immediately dived on the approaching group of tanks, destroying three of them with 5-inch rockets. Altogether, bazooka, artillery, and air strikes knocked out six North Korean tanks during the morning, either <b>within</b> <b>or</b> {{on the edge of}} the 1st Battalion position. In its first engagement with American troops, the NK 2nd Division lost all but two of the eight tanks that had been attached to it a few days earlier at Chongju.|$|E
5|$|Several species {{initially}} classified <b>within</b> <b>or</b> {{referred to}} Allosaurus {{do not belong}} within the genus. A. medius was named by Marsh in 1888 for various specimens from the Early Cretaceous Arundel Formation of Maryland, {{although most of the}} remains were removed by Richard Swann Lull to the new ornithopod species Dryosaurus grandis, except for a tooth. Gilmore considered the tooth nondiagnostic but transferred it to Dryptosaurus, as D. medius. The referral was not accepted in the most recent review, and Allosaurus medius was simply listed as a dubious species of theropod. It may be closely related to Acrocanthosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Shepherd {{satellites}} {{are small}} moons that orbit <b>within,</b> <b>or</b> just beyond, a planet's ring system. They {{have the effect}} of sculpting the rings: giving them sharp edges, and creating gaps between them. Saturn's shepherd moons are Pan (Encke gap), Daphnis (Keeler gap), Atlas (A Ring), Prometheus (F Ring) and Pandora (F Ring). These moons together with co-orbitals (see below) probably formed as a result of accretion of the friable ring material on preexisting denser cores. The cores with sizes from one-third to one-half the present day moons may be themselves collisional shards formed when a parental satellite of the rings disintegrated.|$|E
5|$|The {{administrative}} {{staff of the}} council is selected based on the Local Government Service Commission from <b>within</b> <b>or</b> outside the district. The office of the provincial government is located {{in each of the}} district headquarters and has provincial local government officers and auditors. Each council is responsible for raising and collecting local taxes and the budgets of the council are audited and submitted every year after the annual budget. The elected members of the council do not draw salaries, but are paid allowances from the council. Luapula is a predominantly rural province and there are no city or municipal councils. The government stipulates 63 different functions for the councils with the majority of them being infrastructure management and local administration. Councils are mandated to maintain each of their community centres, zoos, local parks, drainage system, playgrounds, cemeteries, caravan sites, libraries, museums and art galleries. They also work along with specific government departments to help in agriculture, conservation of natural resources, postal service, establishing and maintaining hospitals, schools and colleges. The councils prepare schemes that encourage community participation.|$|E

North was a disappointment, but Bulloch proved to be one of the most effective agents for the Confederacy in Europe.

5|$|The cone shaped fruiting body of Cyathus striatus {{makes use}} of a splash-cup {{mechanism}} to help disperse the spores. When a raindrop hits {{the interior of the}} cup with the optimal angle and velocity, the downward force of the water ejects the peridioles into the air. The force of ejection rips open the funiculus, releasing the tightly wound funicular cord. The hapteron attached {{to the end of the}} funiculus is adhesive, and when it contacts a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it; the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered by the force of the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridioles degrade over time to eventually release the spores <b>within,</b> <b>or</b> they may be eaten by herbivorous animals and redeposited after passing through the digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia, {{which the}} Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for {{legal and illegal}} logging because of the {{desirability}} of their hardwoods. Rare woods such as merbau, meranti and semaram are valuable on the international markets, fetching as much as $1,800perm3 ($1,375percuyd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws is difficult because humans live <b>within</b> <b>or</b> near {{many of the same}} forests as the rhino. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging. Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction, the number of logging permits for these woods has increased dramatically because of the tsunami. However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting, as it can withstand more or less any forest condition.|$|E
5|$|Excavations at Gedi have {{uncovered}} numerous artifacts, {{but the most}} abundant and commonly discussed in literature are beads and ceramics, which {{have been used to}} identify trade and to obtain dates for the site's occupation. Many of the names given to the stone houses refer to the objects found <b>within</b> <b>or</b> in association with them including two Chinese coins, a porcelain bowl, scissors, a Venetian Bead, cowrie shells, an iron lamp, and an iron box. The material remains found at Gedi {{have been found to be}} similar to the remains at adjacent Swahili coastal settlements with the greatest degree of variation among the styles of pottery represented. Of eight sites examined by Kirkman, the sites of Gedi, Ungwana, and Kilepwa had nearly identical material remains prior to the fifteenth century, while the sites of Mnarani, the Pillar Tomb at Malindi, Takwa, Kinuni, and Kilindidni increasingly similar material culture over the course of the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries. In addition to local production, one of the major contributors to the presence of cultural materials found at the site is due to the importance of Indian Ocean trade, which assumed a growing role in East Africa at the beginning of the Islamic era in the seventh century.|$|E

5|$|The provincial {{administration}} {{is set up}} purely for administrative purposes. The province is headed by a minister appointed by the President and there are ministries of central government for each province. The administrative head of the province is the Permanent Secretary, appointed by the President. There is a Deputy Permanent Secretary, heads of government departments and civil servants at the provincial level. Central Province is divided into six districts: Chibombo District, Kabwe District, Kapiri Mposhi District, Mkushi District, Mumbwa District and Serenje District. All of the district headquarters {{are the same as}} the district names. There are six councils in the province, each of which is headed by an elected representative, called a councilor.
