25|$|Michoacán {{handcrafts}} {{and folk}} {{art is a}} Mexican regional tradition centered {{in the state of}} Michoacán, in central/western Mexico. Its origins traced back to the Purépecha Empire, and later to the efforts to organize and promote trades and crafts by Vasco de Quiroga in what is now the north and northeast of the state. The state has a wide variety of over thirty crafts, with the most important being the working of wood, ceramics, and textiles. A number are more particular to the state, such as the creation of religious images from corn stalk paste, and a type of mosaic made from dyed wheat straw on a <b>waxed</b> <b>board.</b> Though there is support for artisans in the way of contests, fairs, and collective trademarks for certain wares (to protect against imitations), Michoacán handcrafts lack access to markets, especially those catering to tourists.|$|E

5000|$|Nineveh was {{destroyed}} in 612 BC {{by a coalition of}} Babylonians, Scythians and Medes, an ancient Iranian people. It is believed that during the burning of the palace, a great fire must have ravaged the library, causing the clay cuneiform tablets to become partially baked. [...] Ironically, this potentially destructive event helped preserve the tablets. As well as texts on clay tablets, some of the texts may have been inscribed onto <b>wax</b> <b>boards</b> which because of their organic nature have been lost.|$|R

Also important for the economic viability of a waxed-board repulping process is adequate defibering of the recovered paper. Several methods for the dewaxing of pulped waxed-boards were investigated.

50|$|Some care is also {{required}} when <b>waxing</b> a <b>board</b> as fluorocarbon <b>waxes</b> emit toxic fumes when overheated. Waxing is best {{performed in a}} ventilated area with care being taken to use the wax at the correct temperature - the wax should be melted but not smoking or smoldering.|$|R
50|$|The {{artifact}} {{consists of}} three components: the base plate, a circular plate of metals with primary relief, and the secondary relief. Sheets of brass are {{used to make the}} base plate, silver sheets to craft the reliefs, lead to create moulds to project the three-dimensional images, and an asphalt or <b>wax</b> <b>board</b> to fix the plate. The base plate is prepared first by craftsman specialized in heavy metals. Then the crafting of designs or reliefs is done by jewelers, and the encrusting of the relief is the prerogative of the diamond-setting expert. The procedure of manufacture involves the making of the base plate followed by the casting of the copper plate, preparing moulds, and crafting the motifs on copper plates and dyes. The base plate is also covered with motifs. Floral and other designs are carved on the reliefs, and the product is then finished by polishing.|$|R

60|$|I {{looked at}} my watch. It was nearly an hour past midnight. In the {{corridor}} the lights were out, except one jet at the end. I threw a cloak upon my shoulders, put on a Spanish hat and left my apartment, listening to the echoes of my measured steps retreating through the deserted passages. A strange sight arrested me on the landing of the grand staircase. Through an open door I saw the moonlight shining {{through the windows of}} a saloon in which some entertainment had recently taken place. I {{looked at my}} watch again: it was but one o'clock; and yet the guests had departed. I entered the room, my boots ringing loudly on the <b>waxed</b> <b>boards.</b> On a chair lay a child's cloak and a broken toy. The entertainment had been a children's party. I stood for a time looking at the shadow of my cloaked figure on the floor, and at the disordered decorations, ghostly in the white light. Then I saw there was a grand piano still open {{in the middle of the}} room. My fingers throbbed as I sat down before it and expressed all I felt in a grand hymn which seemed to thrill the cold stillness of the shadows into a deep hum of approbation, and to people the radiance of the moon with angels. Soon there was a stir without too, as if the rapture were spreading abroad. I took up the chant triumphantly with my voice, and the empty saloon resounded as though to the thunder of an orchestra.|$|R
50|$|At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, she was {{the flag}} bearer for the Netherlands and she was among the outsiders for a medal. Since snowboarding is a small sports in the Netherlands, Sauerbreij used the wax {{services}} provided by the Italian team. Due to using the wrong <b>wax</b> on her <b>board</b> she did not qualify among the first sixteen that entered the knock-out rounds.|$|R

50|$|Another {{method that}} many surfers prefer {{is to let}} their board lie in the sun with the deck side up. After about ten minutes, beach sand is spread onto the melted wax and the sand is then rubbed. This method enables surfers {{to take all the}} wax off at once. The board is then left smooth and ready to be stored away or to be re-waxed. A surfer can also use a wax comb to scrape or comb the <b>wax</b> off the <b>board.</b>|$|R
50|$|On July 13, 2000, the {{expedition}} headed by prof. Valentin Yanin discovered three wooden wax tablets in the soil. The tablets were 19 x 15 x 1 cm, {{and they have}} a 15 x 11.5 cm indentation filled with wax. Two of the tablets have one wax layer and one blank wooden side, and a third tablet has two <b>wax</b> sides. The <b>boards</b> have round holes at one edge, through which wooden pegs were inserted, holding the tablets together as a four-page book.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to sponsor}} skittishness, there almost wasn't a third season. When Snow Crop pulled {{out at the}} end of the {{previous}} year, NBC considered cancelling the show. But Kellogg's and Pet Milk remained, and eventually, the network managed to lure Del Monte to sign on as well. Nonetheless, sponsorship was still unstable. Both Kellogg's and Del Monte dropped {{out at the end}} of 1952, leaving only Pet. Beacon <b>Wax</b> came on <b>board</b> briefly for the first show in January before being quickly replaced by Johnson & Johnson (makers of Band-Aid plastic strips). With only two sponsors remaining (Pet and J&J), NBC was forced to pay for one-third of the expenses - which didn't bode well for the show's future.|$|R
2500|$|Her {{fine art}} won awards for {{original}} designs in scratchboard, brush and ink, and pen drawing. [...] She experimented {{in a wide}} variety of media, and developed a style that is at once abstract and lyrical. Much of her art was intended and used to illustrate her published books of poetry. Some of her art pioneered a new technique created by her, which she called wax painting. It involves a controlled flow and manipulation of poured colored molten <b>wax</b> onto canvas, <b>board,</b> or paper. She also used techniques of cut paper and collage in her art, often supplemented by India ink and acrylics. The subjects she focused on in her art were drawn from her rich, symbolic imagination and dream life. She developed a preference for [...] "primitive" [...] art, whose unassuming simplicity she felt was capable of representing the images she wished to portray.|$|R
50|$|Boardshorts are {{normally}} longer than many shorts or form-fitting speedo styles of swimwear, and often (other than the waist) {{they have a}} loose or baggy appearance. The major reason for the extra length {{is to protect the}} wearer's legs from <b>wax</b> on the <b>board.</b> Surfboards are covered with a layer of sticky wax, which allows the surfer to stand on the board without slipping off. However, this wax can rip leg hair off a surfer when sitting on the board waiting for waves. Long boardshorts cover the back of the leg when sitting on the <b>board,</b> preventing the <b>wax</b> from ripping out the leg hair. The length of boardshorts is also affected by fashion trends; the length can range from mid-thigh (old school) to below the knee, covering the entire knee. In the 2000s, boardshorts were often worn low in the back, exposing the top of the buttocks. Many designs of board shorts use vibrant color, striking patterns including Hawaiian floral images, and highlighted stitching; however not all boardshorts have these features.|$|R
40|$|Nisol Corrugated Cartons {{produces}} printed corrugated boxes. The {{company does}} not compete by having the lowest prices. Instead, it does so by offering high reliability concerning quality and delivery lead times. The company's operation strategy has changed vastly over the past year, ever since the company gone for the expansion. This in turn {{emphasized the importance of}} having the right level and structure of stock for offering the high level of service. In the light of these new challenges, Nisol entrusted the new policies with a project aiming to construct a framework for gaining an understanding of the operations strategy decisions. The purpose of this master dissertation was to evaluate and determine new operations strategy. This was performed in view of company's new supply chain, increased customer requirements and competitive focus. Moreover, the effect that customer demand information (forecast and orders) and internal linkage between the departments pose on the operations strategy decision and thus in the determination of the competitive priorities-. were also researched. A case study research, at the Nisol, was performed to fulfil the purpose. The aim was to collect relevant information for the purpose at hand. Unstructured interviews with managers from different departments were the main source of information. These were supported by in field observations, and documentation to some extent. The customer order decoupling point (CODP) was an important issue inside the operations strategy and sufficient evidence was found for recommending a manufacturing to stock / manufacturing to order strategy. '-CODP of the process can be verified as corrugated board making since the 43 % of the orders are small quantity orders and customization will be started from the printing process of the corrugated boards. However, multiple CODP's were seen on the process with the vast product mix. Pasting process, waxing process and corrugators are found as the CODP's with respectively 7 ply <b>boards,</b> <b>waxed</b> cartons and partitions & dividers as few examples. Furthermore, indication was found to assert that internal linkage is a prerequisite for a successful implementation of this operation strateg...|$|R
