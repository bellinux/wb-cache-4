5|$|In {{the knot}} of {{highways}} that is the Genesee County seat, NY33 crosses and briefly overlaps <b>with</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> NY5, the other east–west route in town, but both north–south routes, NY63 and NY98. While concurrent with NY98 on Oak Street Extension, NY33 passes over Tonawanda Creek, which travels through Batavia on a roughly northwest–southeast alignment. The brief overlap with NY98 ends at Main Street, which carries NY5 and NY63 through the western portion of the city. NY33 turns east here, overlapping with NY5 and NY63 for five blocks along the four-lane, mostly commercial Main Street. NY63 leaves in downtown Batavia at Ellicott Street; however, NY5 and NY33 continue to follow Main Street {{through much of the}} city's eastern half.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{introduction}} to the United States, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire has been credited <b>with</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> single-handedly reviving the game show genre, but also breaking new ground for it. The series revolutionized {{the look and feel}} of game shows with its unique lighting system, dramatic music cues, and futuristic set. The show also became one of the highest-rated and most popular game shows in U.S. television history, and has been credited with paving the way for the rise of the reality TV phenomenon to prominence throughout the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} Bond novels, such as Casino Royale, {{gambling}} is a theme, <b>with</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> golf {{as part of}} the novel, but opening with the canasta game as well. Raymond Benson identified times in the novel when Bond's investigation of Goldfinger was a gamble too and cites Bond tossing a coin to decide on his tactics in relation to his quarry. Once more (as with Live and Let Die and Dr. No) it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what turns out to be an American problem and this can be seen as Fleming's reaction to the lack of US support over the Suez Crisis in 1956 as well as Bond's warning to Goldfinger not to underestimate the English.|$|E

5|$|The {{first five}} seasons {{of the series}} were mainly filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia; {{production}} of the show's sixth season, however, was based in Los Angeles, California. Several of the scenes were filmed on the sets from NYPD Blue, whose sets were located just across from The X-Files studios. All of Fellig's cameras were borrowed from the University of California's Museum of Photography. Many of the photographs were used courtesy of Corbis. The production staff of The X-Files were tasked <b>with</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> creating the photographs that Fellig {{was supposed to have}} taken, but also with crafting each so that they would appear {{as if they had been}} taken from different times. Tom Day, the episodes property master, had to research popular government typefaces and printing technologies to make the pictures appear as historically accurate as possible. Geoffrey Lewis, who portrayed Fellig, was photographed several times and each photo was edited to give the photographs the appearance of coming from different eras.|$|E

25|$|In 1909, Jane Addams and {{her female}} colleagues {{established}} the Juvenile Psychopathic Institute (JPI) in Chicago, later renamed as the Institute for Juvenile Research (IJR), the world's first child guidance clinic.

25|$|Joseph Martin (1740–1808) was a {{brigadier general}} in the Virginia militia during the American Revolutionary War, in which Martin's {{frontier}} diplomacy with the Cherokee people is credited <b>with</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> averting Indian attacks on the Scotch-Irish American and English American settlers who helped win the battles of Kings Mountain and Cowpens, but with also helping to keep the Indians' position neutral and from siding with the British troops during those crucial battles. Historians agree that the settlers' success at these two battles signaled the turning of the tide of the Revolutionary War—in favor of the Americans.|$|E
25|$|The Babenberg Margraves {{controlled}} {{very little}} of modern Austria.

However they embarked on a programme of consolidating their power base. One such method was to employ indentures servants such as the Kuenringern family as Ministeriales and given considerable military and administrative duties. They survived as a dynasty through good fortune and skill at power politics, in that era dominated by the continual struggle between emperor and papacy.|$|E
