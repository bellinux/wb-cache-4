MANETS are mobile in nature and use wireless communication, so the main disadvantage for MANETS is providing Security to the nodes. In order to secure the communication between nodes we use one important action called Certificate Revocation. The previous work is done using voting and Non-voting based communication. The proposed system uses Cluster based certificate revocation where it classifies the topology into clusters and finds the malicious nodes. It finds the false accused nodes with the help of Cluster Head (CH). The system also maintains two important lists 1) <b>Warning</b> <b>List</b> 2) Black Lists. This method overcomes the existing system by enhancing the security and increasing the performance of detecting the malicious nodes...|$|E

40|$|Most warning {{research}} has focused on how to best present individual hazards on signs and labels. However, many products have multiple hazards and to date there has been very little research on how to effectively present multi-hazard warnings. The present paper studies the sequencing of safety warnings in product manuals using warning statements from manuals of three power tools, each having multiple hazards associated with their use, maintenance, and storage. This research also examines the relationship between statement orderings and several user-belief dimensions. One group of 25 participants ordered sets of warning statements based on how they believed the <b>warnings</b> hould be <b>listed</b> in the manuals. Another group of 25 participants rated each warning statement on importance, injury severity, injury likelihood, and prior awareness. The results provide a quantitative summary of preferred statement order that could be useful in assembling <b>warning</b> <b>lists</b> in manuals. Three of the four belief dimensions had substantial negative correlations with mean rank; the fourth, prior awareness, showed a weaker relationship.

The purpose of this case study is to contribute {{to an understanding of the}} process by which a particular school, Byrd Elementary (a pseudonym), attempted to improve its state testing outcomes after being placed on the academic early <b>warning</b> <b>list</b> in 2001 and to meet the challenge of No Child Left Behind. This study explored historical data, teachers' and administrators' perceptions, decisions that stemmed from staff development and the comprehensive school reform model, and outcomes for an at-risk school placed on the state <b>warning</b> <b>list.</b> According to the 2001 school report card, Byrd Elementary, like many of the schools under state censure, had a large number of students identified as low-income (> 60 %) and as ethnic minorities (> 75 %). Socioeconomic status is considered the most significant factor in determining academic success. How then do years of failure and the hurdle of low socioeconomic status for the majority of the school's students impact the perceptions of the teachers and administrators regarding the school's ability to ensure that no child is left behind? For 18 years, Byrd Elementary has had one of the highest number of students identified as low-income in the district, even when low-income students made up 35 % of the student population in the 1987 - 1988 school year. In 18 years, the percentage of low-income students has increased from 35 % to 87 %, and standardized test scores have decreased from 65 % of students meeting or exceeding standards for reading at grade three to 33 %. The school, once predominantly White (69 %), currently has less than 12 % of the student population identified as White. Prior to AEWL, the number of students meeting or exceeding standards for reading decreased every year. Since being placed on AEWL the number of students meeting or exceeding standards for reading has increased three out of four years. Test results for 2005 indicate that 45 % of students are meeting or exceeding state standards in reading. The last time the school had 45 % or more of the students meeting or exceeding standards in grade three reading was in 1998 when less than 60 % of the student population was identified as low-income...|$|E

40|$|AbstractConserving {{energy and}} {{ensuring}} security {{are the main}} challenges of Wireless sensor Networks (WSNs). Energy at the sensors must be preserved to increase the lifetime of the network. Clustering helps in {{reducing the number of}} transmissions between the Cluster Head (CH) and the Base Station (BS). In this paper, an Energy Conserved - Supervised Termite Colony based Role Assignment (EC-STCRA) scheme is proposed to conserve energy. The network is trained to provide better performance by incorporating efficient clustering, routing and security schemes. The CHs are randomly selected, and the soldier and the worker nodes are appointed based on their location and Residual Energy (RE). Efficient paths to the BS are found by selecting the worker nodes with high RE. The soldiers protect the network from attacks like Denial of Service (DoS), flooding and spoofing by maintaining an Active List (AL) of reliable nodes along with a <b>Warning</b> <b>List</b> (WL) and a Dead List (DL) of malicious nodes. EC-STCRA outperforms the existing Genetic algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) based clustering and routing schemes in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Packet Loss Ratio (PLR), throughput, delay, Residual Energy (RE) and network lifetime...|$|E

Discussion {{on what it}} is, how it is developed, and its connection to student achievement have become the hallmark of educational jargon in the 21 st century. This narrative seeks to look at teacher quality {{in a way in}} which it brings the elements to life: as a means 1) to review how the terms excellence and quality are shaped by policy, specifically, the No Child Left Behind law 2) to identify how educators perceive teaching quality, and 3) to review how quality is cultivated in teachers. Within this scope, I will be reviewing ways in which the terms quality and excellence are defined. I will also review how the term quality teaching is created from a social construct, how this social construct interplays with the No Child Left Behind mandates, administrators' perceptions, and teachers' intrinsic motivation to aspire to be a quality teacher. I have chosen a narrative interpretive approach as the means to share this information with the reader. In-depth interviews will constitute the data portion of the study with attention given to the literary nature of teacher quality.

As states attempt to comply with the regulations of No Child Left Behind, school districts and schools have come under increasing pressure to demonstrate that each child is making adequate yearly progress. Facing serious consequences for failing schools, districts struggle with ameliorating the low-performing status of such schools. This dissertation examines the perceptions and response of key players as they implemented a mandated literacy-based school improvement initiative. The {{purpose of this study was}} to (a) describe the perceptions of each school with regard to the prescribed intervention; (b) identify the structures, activities, and processes in which schools engaged in order to implement the prescribed intervention; and (c) identify barriers to implementation and describe the manner in which each school attempted to overcome these barriers. Multiple case-study methodology with mixed methods was used to analyze the perceptions, responses, and barriers to implementation of the Four Blocks balanced literacy framework in three suburban schools in the same district in the Chicago metropolitan area. Schools chosen for this study were not on any state <b>warning</b> <b>list</b> but were identified as in need of remediation by their own district. The study took place as each school was in its second year of implementation. A survey was administered and completed by classroom teachers at each school. Semistructured interviews were conducted with building- and district-level administrators. First- through sixth-grade teachers participated in focus groups at each site. Classroom observations were conducted at each school. The qualitative data was analyzed by thematic analysis procedures and compared to quantitative date from the survey, classroom observation checklist, and a review of pertinent documents. Data were analyzed both within and across schools. Findings suggest that given the right conditions, mandates can work. Although the district, the school, the principal, and the teachers each play a role in the successful implementation of school improvement initiatives, consideration of and fostering human connections at each of these levels appear to have encouraged implementation of a prescribed initiative to a greater degree. Districts and schools looking to effect change must make opportunities that allow those who are involved with change to build working relationships...|$|E
