5|$|Strange studies {{under the}} Ancient One and Mordo, and from ancient {{books in the}} library that is now guarded by the master Wong. Strange learns that Earth is {{protected}} from threats from other dimensions by a shield generated from three buildings called Sanctums, in New York City, London, and Hong Kong, which are all connected and accessible from Kamar-Taj. The sorcerers' task {{is to protect the}} Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into <b>walking</b> <b>again.</b> Strange progresses quickly, and secretly reads the text from which Kaecilius stole pages, learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto. Mordo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, drawing a comparison to Kaecilius' desire for eternal life.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century; the Frankston {{virologist}} Ruth Bishop lead the research team that discovered the rotavirus in 1973, and the Frankston microsurgeon Graeme Miller lead the surgical team that performed the world's first successful scalp replantation in 1976. At the turn of the 21st century, research into botulinum toxin injection therapy for paralysis at Frankston Rehabilitation Hospital by the rehabilitation specialist Nathan Johns resulted in a stroke victim standing and <b>walking</b> <b>again</b> in 2009 after being paralysed for of 20 years.|$|E
25|$|The dynamic {{interactions}} between Spinal cord and sensory input are ensured by modulating transmission in locomotor pathways in a state- and phase-dependent manner. For instance, proprioceptive inputs from extensors can, during stance, adjust {{the timing and}} amplitude of muscle activities of the limbs to the speed of locomotion but be silenced during the swing phase of the cycle. Similarly, skin afferents participate predominantly in the correction of limb and foot placement during stance on uneven terrain, but skin stimuli can evoke different types of responses depending on when they occur within the step cycle. It {{is important to note}} that inputs from the hip appear to play a critical role in spinal locomotion. Experiments on spinal animals showed that when one limb is held with the hip flexed, locomotion on that side stops while the other limb continues walking. However, when the stopped limb is extended at the hip joint to a point normally reached at the end of stance during walking, it suddenly flexes and starts <b>walking</b> <b>again</b> provided that the contralateral limb is a position to accept the weight of the hindquarters. Other work confirmed the importance of hip afferents for locomotor rhythm generation since flexion of the hip will abolish the rhythm whereas extension will enhance it.|$|E
60|$|THE LADY. No, thanks: I prefer <b>walking.</b> Goodbye. <b>Again,</b> many, many thanks.|$|R
60|$|We {{were just}} <b>walking</b> on <b>again,</b> when certain words in that last {{sentence}} startled me. I stopped short once more.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he shook}} hands cordially, and went <b>walking</b> out <b>again</b> {{into the wild}} March weather as if he liked it.|$|R
500|$|After Bryan's {{discouraging}} speech, Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) retrieves Artie's {{paper from}} the trash and learns that his biggest dream {{is to become a}} dancer. Tina would like to dance with Artie, but he falls off his crutches when he tries to stand up from his wheelchair. Tina comforts Artie by showing him some of the latest research in spinal cord injury treatments. While waiting for Tina to buy pretzels at the mall, Artie fantasizes about being able to stand up from his wheelchair and dances to [...] "The Safety Dance" [...] in a flash mob dream sequence. He later asks guidance counsellor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) for advice on how to cope with the possibility of <b>walking</b> <b>again</b> in light of the new research, but is disappointed when Emma tells him that such treatments may not become available for a long time. Tina continues to offer to dance with him but he declines, insisting that she choose another partner but agreeing to sing during the dance. Tina chooses Mike (Harry Shum, Jr.) as her dance partner as Artie leads the glee club into [...] "Dream a Little Dream of Me".|$|E
2500|$|In early March, Araujo visited Ramos-Horta in Darwin. He {{said that}} Ramos-Horta had forgiven Reinado {{for the attack}} and did not {{understand}} why Reinado had wanted to kill him. According to Araujo, Ramos-Horta, who had started <b>walking</b> <b>again,</b> was [...] "very lucid, showing his concern {{for the country and}} the responsibility of the head of state"; he wanted the people to remain calm and wanted a full investigation to take place.|$|E
2500|$|In Part 1 of the follow-up, {{reporter}} [...] {{revealed that}} a woman declared as cured of breast cancer by a spirit entity channeled by John of God died in 2003. A woman in a wheelchair with multiple sclerosis, who in the 1998 report said she visited John of God with the expectation of <b>walking</b> <b>again,</b> didnâ€™t feel any effect, is still in a wheelchair, and her condition deteriorated. Her trip to the Casa cost $5,000. Usher reported {{that none of the}} other people (forty Australians) who made the pilgrimage that Hayes joined for investigation improved.|$|E
60|$|The {{blue glass}} lamp of the police-station came into sight, {{and for an}} instant she stopped. Then she was <b>walking</b> on <b>again,</b> her chin tilted. But her voice shook a little as she spoke.|$|R
60|$|Isabel {{looked at}} her companion. His eyes {{were still on the}} ground. Pale, silent, motionless, he waited by her like a dog, until she gave the signal of <b>walking</b> on <b>again</b> towards the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{there are}} ties that can't be kept by mere resolution," [...] said Stephen, {{starting}} up and <b>walking</b> about <b>again.</b> [...] "What is outward faithfulness? Would they have thanked us for anything so hollow as constancy without love?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The PDSA {{noted that}} she {{protected}} thousands of human lives {{as part of}} her assignments. On her last mission in 2012, when she was on patrol in Afghanistan, she sniffed out a 30-pound (13.6-kilogram) IED and was continuing her search when she lost one of her legs when another IED detonated underneath her. Cpl. Juan Rodriguez, her handler, thought she had been killed, but was able to rescue her. He administered first aid, and Lucca was then airlifted to Germany for medical treatment and rehabilitation. [...] Ten days after the explosion, she was <b>walking</b> <b>again.</b> Following her recovery from her injury, Lucca retired. She lives in California with Gunnery Sgt. Chris Willingham and his family.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, Duffy {{was part of}} Coloursound with bassist Craig Adams and ex-Alarm {{frontman}} Mike Peters, then Dead Men <b>Walking</b> (<b>again</b> with Peters) and later Cardboard Vampyres. Sorum {{became a member of}} the hard rock supergroup Velvet Revolver. In 2003, all of the Cult's records were issued on CD, with several bonus tracks being issued on the Russian, Belarusian, and Lithuanian versions. These eastern European releases had many printing mistakes on the jacket sleeves and lyric inserts. In October 2004, all of the Cult's records were again remastered and issued again on CD, this time in Japan in different cardboard foldout sleeves. [...] "She Sells Sanctuary" [...] appeared in the 2002 video game , playing on rock station [...]|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you, no, I shan't want it; I expect I {{shall be}} out, {{in the course}} of an hour or so,' replied the other in a hurried manner. Then, <b>walking</b> <b>again</b> up to the window, and once more {{returning}} disappointed, he sighed deeply, and left the room; upon which the other two burst into a loud laugh.|$|E
25|$|The Master {{appears in}} the Big Finish Productions audio play, Dust Breeding, where Geoffrey Beevers reprised the role. The story reveals that, at some point after Survival, the Master's Trakenite body is damaged and he becomes a <b>walking</b> corpse <b>again,</b> using the alias Mr Seta, another anagram of Master.|$|R
50|$|He {{then joined}} an Iowa regiment, {{in which he}} served until being {{discharged}} for ill health. Bowman was unable to walk {{as a result of}} his illness and complications caused by the harsh conditions of his service, and used crutches until he was able to begin <b>walking</b> unaided <b>again</b> in 1874.|$|R
50|$|The entire {{audience}} is {{shocked by the}} event taking place, especially Julian Ledezma, and the family of Paola. She is taken to hospital immediately. Expectations that again {{are very difficult to}} walk, report Armendares family doctors. However, despite all the forecasts, and after several treatments and surgery, Paola <b>walking</b> is <b>again.</b>|$|R
60|$|Haskins was in {{the midst}} of the terrible toil of the last year. He was <b>walking</b> <b>again</b> in the rain and the mud behind his plough - he felt the dust and dirt of the threshing. The ferocious husking- time, with its cutting wind and biting, {{clinging}} snows, lay hard upon him. Then he thought of his wife, how she had cheerfully cooked and baked, without holiday and without rest.|$|E
60|$|She {{had passed}} by. He {{felt as if}} he were <b>walking</b> <b>again</b> in a far world, not Cossethay, a far world, the fragile reality. He went on, quiet, suspended, rarefied. He could not bear to think or to speak, nor make any sound or sign, nor change his fixed motion. He could {{scarcely}} bear to think of her face. He moved within the knowledge of her, in the world that was beyond reality.|$|E
6000|$|... "Everybody! And he'll be in {{the same}} scrape again next week!" [...] said Mr. Jarndyce, <b>walking</b> <b>again</b> at a great pace, with a candle in his hand that had gone out. [...] "He's always in the same scrape. He was born in the same scrape. I verily believe that the {{announcement}} in the newspapers when his mother was confined was 'On Tuesday last, at her residence in Botheration Buildings, Mrs. Skimpole of a son in difficulties.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd sooner pay double than {{be talked}} {{to in this}} way," [...] said the squire, angrily, and, as he spoke, he got up hurriedly from his chair, thrust {{his hands into his}} trousers-pockets, walked quickly to the window, and {{immediately}} <b>walking</b> back <b>again,</b> threw himself once more into his chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whether {{you have}} yet thought over the many {{advantages}} of your continuing to live at that place?" [...] repeats Mr. Guppy, <b>walking</b> him on <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Edith Granger, Sir,' {{replied the}} Major, {{shutting}} one eye, putting {{his head on}} one side, passing his cane into his left hand, and smoothing his shirt-frill with his right, 'is, at this present time, not quite thirty. And damme, Sir,' said the Major, shouldering his stick once more, and <b>walking</b> on <b>again,</b> 'she's a peerless woman!' ...|$|R
60|$|For {{a couple}} of hours the warden {{remained}} thus in the garden, now walking, now standing motionless on the turf, and then, as his legs got weary, sitting unconsciously on the garden seats, and then <b>walking</b> <b>again.</b> And Eleanor, hidden behind the muslin curtains of the window, watched him through the trees as he now came in sight, and then again was concealed by the turnings of the walk; and thus the time passed away till five, when the warden crept back to the house and prepared for dinner.|$|E
60|$|I {{can only}} hope {{sincerely}} that they did not. I {{do not wish to}} talk about myself. That would be egotism. But the mystery of the professor troubles me to this day. A grave, earnest gentleman, the father of a family, I saw him with my own eyes put that ridiculous pasteboard mask over his head. Later on--a good deal later on--I found myself <b>walking</b> <b>again</b> with him through silent star-lit streets. Where {{he had been in the}} interval, and who then was the strange creature under the Chinaman's mask, will always remain to me an unsolved problem.|$|E
6000|$|The spring {{advanced}} rapidly while I {{was engaged}} on this work and as my crew occasionally took contracts {{in the country}} I have vivid pictures of the green and pleasant farm lands, of social farmers at barn-raisings, and of tables filled with fatness. I am <b>walking</b> <b>again</b> in my stocking feet, high on the [...] "purline plate," [...] beetle in hand, driving home the oaken [...] "pins." [...] I am shingling on the broad roof of a suburban house from which I can see the sunny slopes of a meadow and sheep feeding therein. I am mending a screen door for a farmer's wife while she confides to me the tragedy of her life--and always I have the foolish boyish notion that I am {{out in the world}} and seeing life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, yes, {{of course}} they could. It {{is easy to see}} that you are a soldier. They were no fools, those old crusaders. My word, we must be getting on. They are hauling down the Union Jack on the west tower. I always have it hauled down at sunset," [...] and he began <b>walking</b> briskly <b>again.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'What is {{this round}} tower?' Ladywell said <b>again,</b> <b>walking</b> towards the iron- grey bastion, partly covered with ivy and Virginia creeper, which stood obtruding into the enclosure.|$|R
60|$|Like Ashe, he {{had always}} visualized the {{recovery}} of his scarab as {{a thing of the}} small hours, a daring act to be performed when sleep held the castle in its grip. That an opportunity would be presented to him of walking in quite calmly and <b>walking</b> out <b>again</b> with the Cheops in his pocket, had never occurred to him as a possibility.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he told me}} {{the scheme}} he had planned, then said: [...] "If I can arrange with these people on this basis--it will take several weeks to find out--I will see to it that they get the money they need. Then the thing will move right along and your {{royalties}} will cease to be waste paper. I will post you the minute my scheme fails or succeeds. In the meantime, you stop walking the floor. Go off to the country and try to be gay. You may have to go to <b>walking</b> <b>again,</b> but don't begin till I tell you my scheme has failed." [...] And he added: [...] "Keep me posted always as to where you are--for if I need you and can use you--I want to know where to put my hand on you." ...|$|E
60|$|The caravan {{moved on}} about twenty-five miles a day. At the next camp Allie tried <b>walking</b> <b>again,</b> {{to find her}} feet were bruised, her legs cramped, and action awkward and painful. But she persevered, and the {{tingling}} of revived circulation was like needles pricking her flesh. She limped from one camp-fire to another; and all the rough men had a kind word or question or glance for her. Allie did not believe they were all honest men. Durade had employed a large force, and apparently he had taken on every one who applied. Miners, hunters, scouts, and men of no hall-mark except that of wildness composed the mixed caravan. It spoke much for Durade that they were under control. Allie well remembered hearing her mother {{say that he had}} a genius for drawing men to him and managing them.|$|E
60|$|Joan seated herself {{while he}} placed {{food and drink}} before her. She {{did not look at}} him and did not feel his gaze upon her. Far asunder as they had been {{yesterday}} the distance between them to-day was incalculably greater. She ate as much as she could swallow and pushed the rest away. Leaving the camp-fire, she began <b>walking</b> <b>again,</b> here and there, aimlessly, scarcely seeing what she looked at. There was a shadow over her, an impending portent of catastrophe, a moment standing dark and sharp out of the age-long hour. She leaned against the balsam and then she rested in the stone seat, and then she had to walk again. It might have been long, that time; she never knew how long or short. There came a strange flagging, sinking of her spirit, accompanied by vibrating, restless, uncontrollable muscular activity. Her nerves {{were on the verge of}} collapse.|$|E
60|$|Presently he came {{in sight}} <b>again,</b> <b>walking</b> quietly away. He did not look round; but when nearly {{at the bottom of}} the hill turned, lifted one hand, and {{disappeared}} behind some houses.|$|R
60|$|Two hours' work {{completed}} the new weapons, {{and with their}} bows slung at their backs, and using their pikes as <b>walking</b> staves, they <b>again</b> set out on their journey across the continent.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{suppose a}} man never {{was placed in}} a more ridiculous position,' he said, after looking down, and looking up, and laughing, and frowning, and walking off, and <b>walking</b> back <b>again.</b> 'But I see no way out of it. What will be, will be. This will be, I suppose. I must take off myself, I imagine - in short, I engage to do it.' ...|$|R
