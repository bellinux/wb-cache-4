25|$|Piper {{received}} numerous {{phone calls}} and apologies from Lynch. On 31 March 2008, {{two days after the}} initial attack, Lynch persuaded Piper to go to an internet cafe to read an email he had sent to her Facebook account. Lynch gave her details to Stefan Sylvestre, who identified her on Golders Green Road. Wearing a hoodie to obscure his identity, Sylvestre approached Piper, who thought he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for money, and then threw sulphuric acid at her face.|$|E
500|$|An {{accomplished}} writer, series creator Nic Pizzolatto {{delved into}} fiction writing and published a novel, titled Galveston (2010), before being appointed as a screenwriter for AMC's The Killing the following year. It was {{around this time}} that Pizzolatto was preparing to branch out into television, an endeavor that, {{due to a lack}} of capital, was never fully realized. He had already begun writing True Detective as his next novel, but later, once the project took definite form, felt it was more suitable on screen. [...] "I'd always had plans from the first time I'd talked to an agent from Hollywood, I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> how you break into this business, and particularly cable-TV writing, because in television the writer stays in control, which is what the concept of show runner is", he remembers. Pizzolatto pitched Galveston to several executives, and from May to July 2010, he drafted six screenplays, including a spec script for [...] "The Long Bright Dark" [...] which consumed 90 pages. Shortly thereafter, he secured a development deal with HBO for a potential pilot series.|$|E

I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{you to look at}} these two tragedies {{from my point of view}} and from your own at the same time, and I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you whether any possible motive suggested itself to you, any possible person or cause, which might be benefited by the removal of these two men." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then look here," [...] Weiss said. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him <b>to</b> {{come into}} this office.

We {{know now that}} Mr. Weatherley had some reason to fear an interruption to his everyday life. Directly or indirectly, that interruption is connected with certain things of which you and I have spoken together. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you, therefore, <b>to</b> keep your promise. I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> tell me everything that you know." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Gale, I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you {{a rather}} curious thing. Will you do it, without asking why?" [...] Colonel Shepherd said, quietly.|$|R
