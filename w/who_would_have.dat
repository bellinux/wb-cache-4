5|$|As ancient as {{this music}} is, {{there has never}} been {{substantial}} data recorded regarding the kulintang’s origins.

5|$|Lang often {{spoke in}} the House of Lords about the {{treatment}} of Russian Christians in the Soviet Union. He also denounced the anti-semitic policies of the German government, and he took private steps to help European Jews. In 1938 he was instrumental in saving 60 rabbis from Burgenland, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been murdered by the Nazis had the archbishop not obtained them entry visas to England..|$|E
5|$|LeRoy King, one of {{the members}} of the Coolidge Mission, wrote in his report that the {{authorities}} in Maribor were suspicious of the work of the mission and apparently feared that it had uncovered information they would have preferred to conceal.

5|$|Mulder finds {{passages}} of obscure medieval poetry in Incanto's e-mails, and compiles {{a list of}} people <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> access to the texts from which these were taken. The agents, along with local detective Alan Cross (James Handy), agree to canvass everyone on the list. Meanwhile, Incanto, a translator of medieval Italian literature, receives a package while talking to Monica and her blind daughter, Jessie. He receives an e-mail from Kaminsky, asking to arrange another date; he is also questioned by Cross.|$|E
5|$|The rectors {{were almost}} all royal favourites or up-and-coming ecclesiastical leaders, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> rarely visited the church. Perhaps {{the most notable}} of the rectors at this time was Antony Bek, who held the living from 1277–84. He was brother to Thomas Bek, bishop of St David’s 1280–93. Antony Bek became bishop of Durham and Patriarch of Jerusalem, but was more noted as a warrior than for his piety.|$|E

5|$|As both Manchester United and Bayern Munich {{traditionally}} wore red {{as their}} primary kit colour, UEFA regulations would normally have required both teams to wear their change kits. However, the two clubs felt {{it would have been}} a shame for neither to wear their traditional colours, and they agreed to toss a coin to see <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> first choice. Manchester United won the toss and therefore wore their usual European colours of red shirts, white shorts and white socks, while Bayern wore silver shirts, shorts and socks, all with maroon trim.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{pushed for}} greater {{consultation}} and {{voice for the}} dominions, and succeeded in having Richard Casey appointed as a permanent political liaison in London <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> access to British government decisions and act as a conduit between Westminster and Melbourne. He also successfully lobbied {{for the creation of}} a Dominion Office separated out from the Colonial Office to acknowledge the different state of affairs that now existed in the Empire. However, while fellow dominions generally agreed that the imperial system should be modified, not all shared his vision for closer collaboration and strong ties. Canada and the Union of South Africa were instead seeking greater independence from London, and there was little enthusiasm for many of Bruce's more ambitious plans for inter-empire trade and policy cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Crane {{starts to}} believe that a {{conspiracy}} links all the deaths together, so he looks into Van Garrett's last will. Van Garrett had made a new will just before he died, leaving all his possessions to his secret new bride, Emily Winship, whom Crane discovers was pregnant with Van Garrett's child. Crane deduces that all who knew about the new will, the marriage and the pregnancy were the victims of the Horseman and that Katrina's father Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> inherited the fortune, is the person holding the skull. Katrina, finding out that Crane suspects her father, burns all the evidence that Crane has accumulated.|$|E

5|$|For example, {{take the}} fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs {{as shown in}} the table. The first {{stimulus}} is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. As {{can be seen in the}} table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{after the}} Rockets won a coin toss against the Baltimore Bullets to {{determine}} <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> the first overall {{pick in the}} 1968 NBA Draft, they selected Elvin Hayes from the University of Houston. Hayes led the team to the franchise's first ever playoff appearance in 1969, but the Rockets lost in the semi-finals of the Western Division to the Atlanta Hawks, four games to two. In 1970 NBA Draft, the Rockets drafted Calvin Murphy and Rudy Tomjanovich, who would both spend their whole careers with the Rockets.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Matheson's {{opinion about the}} name Ljótr, the 20th-century historian A. Morrison was {{of the opinion that}} the name may not be as rare as some people have thought. Morrison noted that the 19th century antiquary F.W.L. Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. Morrison considered it possible that Leod's name could have ultimately originated from that of Ljótólfr's; however, while he considered it possible that Ljótólfr could have been an ancestor of Leod, he did not think it could have been in the male-line.|$|E

5|$|James Abbott McNeill Whistler {{was born}} in the United States in 1834, the son of George Washington Whistler, a railway engineer. In 1843, his father {{relocated}} the family to Saint Petersburg, Russia, where James received training in painting. After a stay in England, he returned to America to attend the US Military Academy at West Point in 1851. In 1855, he made his way back to Europe, determined to dedicate himself to painting. He settled in Paris at first, but in 1859 moved to London, where he would spend most of the remainder of his life. There he met Dante Gabriel Rossetti {{and other members of the}} Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a profound influence on Whistler.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of {{the identities of the}} men who served on the Mary Rose, even {{when it comes to the}} names of the officers, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> belonged to the gentry. Two admirals and four captains (including Edward and Thomas Howard, who served both positions) are known through records, as well as a few ship masters, pursers, master gunners and other specialists. Forensic science has been used by artists to create reconstructions of faces of eight crew members, and the results were publicized in May 2013. In addition, {{researchers}} have extracted DNA from remains in the hopes of identifying origins of crew, and potentially living descendants.|$|E
5|$|Lord Goring, who had {{proposed}} the second siege, renewed the blockade {{for a third}} time in mid-May, after engaging Weldon's departing army and forcing it back into Taunton. Goring's siege was lax and allowed provisions into the town, diminishing its effectiveness. The Parliamentarian defence tied up Goring and his 10–15,000 troops, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> otherwise been available to fight for King Charles at Naseby, where historians believe they could have tipped the battle in favour of the Royalists. Instead, after securing a Parliamentarian victory at Naseby, Thomas Fairfax marched his army to relieve Taunton on 9 July 1645.|$|E
