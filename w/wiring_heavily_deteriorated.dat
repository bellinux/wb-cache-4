Calcium antimonate would act as a white colorant and the lead antimonate as an opacifier. Similar to the green glaze, the white glaze was separated from the brick body by particles of unreacted silica up to 1.5  mm in length {{that appear to be}} part of an engobe layer. Calcium antimonate has also been found as a white glaze colorant in Achaemenid Susa [23], neo-Babylonian Babylon [17], and both neo-Assyrian sites of Nimrud [22], and Nineveh [27]. One study of Achaemenid Susa brick fragments found sodium antimonate as a white colorant [24].|$|R
40|$|Abstract • Multimedia {{transmission}} over wireless Internet is {{a challenging}} work since the random errors frequently {{occurred in the}} wireless links <b>heavily</b> <b>deteriorates</b> the performance of traditional transport protocols such as TCP and UDP. This paper presents a new scheme for delivering multimedia over a connection of which only the last hop is wireless link. Simultaneously error control and congestion control are addressed in this wireless Internet platform. The packet loss caused by Internet congestion and wireless error can be differentiated in our scheme. Fading and high bit error rate (BER) on the wireless link as well as congestion in the wired network are separately controlled. Simulation results demonstrate that the proper congestion control and error control can improve throughput of the connection and the end-to-end quality of delivered media. 1...|$|R

50|$|In 1854, the Vilafranca line placed its {{terminus}} station near Canaletes and Portal de Isabel II, on {{the south}} part of Plaça de Catalunya. This line was built in Iberian broad gauge and connected Vilafranca del Penedès and other municipalities in Tarragona province with Barcelona city. Finally, this line placed its terminus station at Sants railway station. On 1 July 1932 a new underground station serving the Iberian gauge rail was opened as a terminus station on Manresa and Puigcerdà lines. These lines had its terminus station at Estació del Nord and were managed by Ferrocarril del Norte, one of the Renfe's predecessors. In 1977 {{with the opening of}} the rail link between this station and Sants, the station ceased to be a terminus station and Manresa and Puigcerdà lines placed its terminus station in Sants.

40|$|In multi-hop ad hoc {{networks}} the IEEE 802. 11 MAC protocol, in its distributed version, dramatically degrades {{the performance}} {{in terms of}} throughput and delay. This {{is due to a}} protocol property which tries to provide equal probability of channel access to all nodes. But in multi-hop ad hoc network a more frequent channel access might be necessary at certain nodes that are intermediate hops and forward other nodes' data. We propose a modification to the protocol that leads to a higher throughput and lower delay by combining the ACK for one packet with the channel access procedure for another, queued-to-be-sent packet. Hence, nodes receiving many packets, probably forwarder, have a higher chance of accessing the channel. Additionally, these changes provide a scheme of packet forwarding more robust to different layouts than original IEEE 802. 11, where performance can <b>heavily</b> <b>deteriorate</b> in certain configurations...|$|R

40|$|The {{reliability}} of structural systems immerged into aggressive environments {{changes over time}} and, generally, proper maintenance interventions are required to achieve suitable levels of lifecycle performance. Often the damage process affecting the systems suffers of uncertainty due to the randomness involved into each environmental attach, therefore the life-cycle assessment {{must be based on}} a suitable damage modeling and on a probabilistic analysis able to model the main features of the time-variant deterioration process. In this paper, an appropriate time dependent damage modeling is applied in connection with a probabilistic analysis based on the semi-Markov theory. The rehabilitation of deteriorated structures requires the development of maintenance strategies where possible selective maintenance scenarios can be considered. In this paper, with the introduction of an appropriate condition index, some repairing strategies, applied only on members <b>heavily</b> <b>deteriorated,</b> are compared each other. The advantages of selective maintenance actions are also investigated by the economical point of view...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The common method neonatologists use {{nowadays}} {{to determine}} White Matter Damage (leukomalacia) is by visual inspection of ultrasound {{images of the}} neonatal brain. Aneed for a (semi) computerized way of delineating the affected regions, {{in order to make}} quantitative measurements as an aid to the subjective diagnosis, is felt. The use of active contours for this purpose is a classical approach [1, 2]. The performance of active contours for this purpose, however, is <b>heavily</b> <b>deteriorated</b> by the presence of speckle noise. In this article a new filter, incorporating prior statistics concerning medical features in these images, is proposed, that removes a significant amount of speckle noise in the healthy parts, while it makes regions affected by WMD more uniform, thus severely improving the performance of the active contour. The results of the active contour after applying the proposed technique are compared with the manual delineation of an expert. Furthermore the proposed technique is compared with two other popular speckle suppression techniques, namely the ones proposed by Lee and Frost...|$|R

The observed corrosion morphology,i. e., pitting corrosion or intergranular corrosion, was strongly dependent on the precipitation state, i. e., mainly the presence of intergranular Mg 2 Si precipitates. A ‘grain size – corrosion resistance’ relationship was also evidenced with an ennoblement of the corrosion potential for <b>wires</b> <b>heavily</b> cold drawn, which were characterized by a nanometric grain size. Dislocation density as well as the homogeneity of alloying element distribution were also found to be relevant parameters for explaining the electrochemical behavior of each microstructural state. Plastic deformation and recrystallization phenomena occurring during the manufacturing process were found to be associated with redistribution of alloying elements, which impeded the formation of intergranular Mg 2 Si precipitates. Therefore, in the present study, the cold drawing process was found to increase the intergranular corrosion resistance of AA 6101...|$|R

40|$|We are {{concerned}} with defining new globalization criteria for solution methods of nonlinear equations. The current criteria used in these methods require a sufficient decrease of a particular merit function at each iteration of the algorithm. As was observed {{in the field of}} smooth unconstrained optimization, this descent requirement can considerably slow the rate of convergence of the sequence of points produced and, in some cases, can <b>heavily</b> <b>deteriorate</b> the performance of algorithms. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show that the global convergence of most methods proposed in the literature for solving systems of nonlinear equations can be obtained using less restrictive criteria that do not enforce a monotonic decrease of the chosen merit function. In particular, we show that a general stabilization scheme, recently proposed for the unconstrained minimization of continuously differentiable functions, can be extended to methods for the solution of nonlinear (nonsmooth) equations. This scheme includes different kinds of relaxation of the descent requirement and opens up the possibility of describing new classes of algorithms where the old monotone linesearch techniques are replaced with more flexible nonmonotone stabilization procedures. As in the case of smooth unconstrained optimization, this should be the basis for defining more efficient algorithms with very good practical rates of convergence...|$|R

The geometry of the steam turbine seals changes throughout the machine life cycle. The rate of deterioration of these seals, in turn, affects heavily {{the efficiency of the}} thermal machine. However, the literature overview does not provide any research reports on flow phenomena occurring in <b>heavily</b> <b>deteriorated</b> seals. The paper describes the course and results of investigations into a model straight through labyrinth seal composed of 4 discs, each with the slot height of 2 mm. The investigations have been conducted with air as the working medium. Changes of gas flow parameters due to wear were analysed. Based on the experimental data, more intensive leakage was observed {{as the result of the}} increased slot height. The static pressure distribution along the examined segment was measured. The experimentally recorded distribution differed remarkably from the theoretical assumptions. Another part of the experimental research focused on comparing the gas velocities at points situated upstream of the first and second seal disc. The velocity measurements were carried out using a constant temperature wire probe. This part of the investigations provided opportunities for analysing the influence of seal wear on gas flow conditions in the seal segment. The paper compares the results of the experimental research with those obtained using the CFX software. The presented results of velocity distributions provide a clear picture of the nature of the gas flow in the seal, which enables its analysis...|$|R

Peru was willing to negotiate, but when Spain sent a Royal Commissary instead of an ambassador, the government of Peru was deeply offended and soon diplomatic relations would turn for the worse. For Peru, a Royal Commissary was a custom that applied to the colony of another nation, while an ambassador was the appropriate title for a discussion among independent nations. Aside from this matter of technical names, {{due to the lack of}} good diplomacy between the Spanish envoy and the Peruvian minister of foreign affairs, the Spanish [...] "scientific expedition" [...] invaded the Chincha Islands (Rich in guano) of Peru just off the coast of the port of Callao. No war had been declared, but this action <b>heavily</b> <b>deteriorated</b> relations to a critical point. Meanwhile, the government of Chile sought to avoid a war with Spain and declared neutrality by officially denying provisions of armaments and fuel to Peru and Spain. Still, just as this order was put into effect two Peruvian steamers were heading out of Valparaíso with supplies, armaments, and Chilean volunteers. Although this was the only incident that went against the Chilean order, the Spanish fleet (no longer a scientific expedition) took it as a pretext to increase hostilities against Chile.

40|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that infertility is a dramatic and frequent side effect in {{men and women of}} childbearing age who are undergoing chemotherapy for their cancer treatment. This, severe and often underestimated complication <b>heavily</b> <b>deteriorates</b> {{the quality of life of}} affected patients and risks to reduce the therapeutic efforts and the compliance towards the suggested treatments. Moreover, cancer related infertility is still considered a marginal aspect of the quality of life in cancer patients. Reproduction's preservation plays today an emerging role in the culture of industrialized countries and moves extraordinary interests from the scientific and economic points, of view. Unfortunately medical oncologists, surgeons and gynaecologists have little consideration, for this complication and often possess a limited knowledge about the clinical aspects of cancer, related infertility and the possibilities of prevention and treatment of cancer related gonadic failure. Since more young people are offered adjuvant treatments at earlier stages of cancer, the problem of, chemotherapy related gonadic toxicity has considerably increased in the last years. It is also important to consider the new opportunity derived from the assisted reproductive techniques available. From this point of view the treating physicians need to be able to make accurate assessments of risks and benefits of antineoplastic treatments in order to schedule the best approach to and to preserve the possibility of reproduction in their young patients. These aspects are more relevant in breast cancer patients, mainly in the early phase of the disease, due to the high probability to retain reproductive possibilities also after aggressive and integrated therapies.
