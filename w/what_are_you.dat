5|$|When Echo & the Bunnymen {{entered the}} studio to record <b>What</b> <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> Going to Do with Your Life?, bassist Les Pattinson {{received}} news {{that his mother was}} unwell. That, coupled with Pattinson's perception that McCulloch wanted everything his way, led to Pattinson announcing his retirement from the band. McCulloch and guitarist Will Sergeant were determined to continue as Echo & the Bunnymen and recruited session musicians so they could record the album. The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and was recorded at Doghouse Studios in Henley-on-Thames, Parr Street Studios in Liverpool, and Olympic Studios, Maida Vale Studios and CTS in London.|$|E
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact {{we were able to do}} our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

25|$|In a December 2015 {{interview}} with BBC Radio 4's Today programme Ahern said low pay workers had brought country {{to its knees}} because they got “cocky” and insisted on “second, third and even fourth homes”. The former Taoiseach said that the availability of cheap credit through Ireland's involvement in the eurozone created “a huge problem”. “Anyone could walk into any institution and seem to get any amount of money {{and this is where}} the cocky bit came in. “Unfortunately… Joe Soap and Mary Soap, who never had a lot, got the loans for the second house and leveraged the third house off the second house and the fourth on the third, and you know, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> having yourself.” People, among them those who had previously regarded the former Taoiseach highly, took to social media and the airwaves to criticise Ahern for his remarks.|$|E

The acoustic tracks were recorded at The Wade Studio from September 10 to September 21. Westfall said the band wasn't going to re-issue the album [...] "unless it's worth the fans' while." [...] The album, along with For Those Who Have Heart and Attack of the Killer B-Sides (2010), had a reissue on vinyl, in 2011. Three songs have featured on various artist compilations: the acoustic version of [...] "Homesick" [...] was released on the Victory Records Fall Sampler 2010, [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>You</b> Made Of?"

500|$|After working {{together}} as Electrafixion, McCulloch, Sergeant and Pattinson regrouped in 1997 and returned as Echo & the Bunnymen with the UK Top 10 hit [...] "Nothing Lasts Forever". An album of new material, Evergreen, was greeted enthusiastically by critics {{and the band}} made a successful return to the live arena. Though Pattinson left the group for a second time, McCulloch and Sergeant continue to record as Echo & the Bunnymen, releasing <b>What</b> <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> Going to Do with Your Life? (1999), Flowers (2001), Siberia (2005), The Fountain (2009), and Meteorites (2014).|$|E
500|$|<b>What</b> <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> Going to Do with Your Life? was {{released}} on 16 April 1999 through London Records following {{the release of the}} first single from the album, [...] "Rust", the previous month. One further single, [...] "Get in the Car", followed the album's release. The album received mixed reviews from the music press, being described as both flawless and having no appeal. The album was not as popular with the public as earlier releases from Echo & the Bunnymen; the album peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Albums Chart.|$|E

500|$|Released in March 1999, [...] "Rust" [...] was {{the first}} single to come from <b>What</b> <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> Going to Do with Your Life?. The single peaked at number twenty-two on the UK Singles Chart, and NME {{magazine}} named it their Single of the Week. The album was released the following month on 16 April and, having failed {{to appeal to the}} public as much as the band's previous albums, peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Albums Chart. [...] "Get in the Car", one of the tracks recorded with Fun Lovin' Criminals, was later released as a single.|$|E
500|$|Schulz {{recalled}} {{that the first}} time he stepped back from the line on defense, Coach Yost was horrified. [...] Yost said, [...] "Dutchman, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> trying to do?" [...] "Stop 'em", replied Schulz. [...] "But you're supposed to play in the line", Yost insisted. [...] "They'll run over us." [...] "Listen Yost", Schulz claims to have said, [...] "My way is best. [...] If any of 'em gets by me, I'll move back into the line and stay there". [...] Yost eventually saw the wisdom in Schulz's technique, and soon nearly all centers were backing up the line on defense.|$|E
500|$|Also in December, {{the music}} video for [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, <b>What</b> <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> Made Of?" [...] was filmed, {{directed}} by Dan Dobi. In early March 2010 the band announced via their Twitter account that the video {{was set for}} release, with a date of March 16. This was further confirmed a few days later, with some fans being able to view it before its release. A delay in releasing it occurred as the band were trying to negotiate with MTV, as Westfall commented: [...] "I think it's more important to have them [...] on board, instead of just putting it on, like, YouTube." [...] "Have Faith in Me" [...] was released as a radio single on March 2, 2010. The video for [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, <b>What</b> <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> Made Of?" [...] had its television premiere on MTV on March 16. The music video {{was based on an}} idea from a friend Kyle Crawford, as McKinnon said: [...] "He was like, 'Hey, you should totally make a video where you guys are playing kickball and you play a bunch of kids and just kick the s*** out of them?" [...] I was like, [...] "That is a great idea. Let's look into it.'" [...] Asked why it was the band's next music video, Westfall said [...] "it stands out compared to the other songs" [...] as [...] "it's a harder song." [...] The song was also released as a radio single.|$|E

It's soft, like your skin." [...] At the {{completion}} of filming, Hasselhoff said, [...] "That's ridiculously awesome. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> gonna do with it?" [...] Asked by the crew if he wanted to keep it, he answered, [...] "Uh, yeah. Okay." [...] Hasselhoff filmed in cold water, where he was pulled by a sled nine yards across the sea; he described the experience as [...] "cold but [...] lot of fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Echo & the Bunnymen left London Records {{in early}} 2000. McCulloch said, [...] "What they said is, 'We'll {{keep you on}} if you don't take {{as much money as}} in the contract,' and we had no {{intention}} of staying anyway, so it was kind of 'were we pushed or did we fall?'" [...] There was also a change in the band's management with Toogood departing to start his own record label. With the session musicians who recorded <b>What</b> <b>Are</b> <b>You</b> Going to Do with Your Life? moving on, McCulloch and Sergeant recruited a new band, with whom they would go on to record the 2000 EP, Avalanche, which was only available to buy over the internet.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Science Journal G. Wayne Clough, the 12th secretary of the Smithsonian Institution assuaged [...] the animosities between critics and proponents of the exhibition: [...] “So I don't think there's anything negative here. I think the Smithsonian tried to do it right. When we heard the concerns, we asked the community to come together and talk about it, and we listened, and some people in that audience had their minds changed, as a matter of fact, but not everybody. So, I think it's time {{in a situation like this}} to pause, and for the profession itself to say, [...] "Okay, there's a problem, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to do about it?
