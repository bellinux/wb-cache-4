[...] "Self-Identity" [...] signifies, e.g. during the hooponopono, that the three selves or aspects of {{consciousness}} are balanced and connected with the Divine Creator. Different from egoistic prayers, [...] "altruistic prayers like hooponopono, where you also pray {{for the release of}} other entities and objects, reach the Divine plane or Cosmos because of their high vibrations. From that plane the Divine energy or [...] "mana" [...] would come," [...] which would transform the painful part of the memory of the wrong actions in all participants to [...] "Pure Light", on whatever plane they are existing; [...] "all are set free". Through this transmutation in the mind the problems will lose their energy for physical effects, and healing or balancing is begun. In this sense, Simeona's mana {{is not the same as}} the traditional Polynesian understanding of mana.|$|E
