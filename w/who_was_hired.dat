5|$|In 1949, Hamilton hired Gordon Landsborough as an editor.

5|$|Tech's {{situation}} was not reflected at Clemson, where offensive coordinator Rich Rodriguez {{announced that he}} was leaving the team for the head football coach job at West Virginia University, where he competed as a player in the 1980s. Rodriguez did not participate in Clemson's practices prior to the Gator Bowl, and he did not coach during the game. Replacing Rodriguez as temporary offensive coordinator was Brad Scott. Joining him in the press box during the Gator Bowl was Mike O'Cain, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>hired</b> as Clemson's new quarterbacks coach. In an effort to prevent further defections, Clemson awarded head coach Tommy Bowden a seven-year contract extension worth $1.1 million annually plus incentives.|$|E
5|$|The 1955–56 {{season was}} the first as head coach for Toe Blake, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>hired</b> to help control Richard's temper. The 1956 victory began an {{unprecedented}} streak of five consecutive Stanley Cups for the Canadiens from 1956 to 1960; the 1960 final was Montreal's tenth consecutive appearance in the championship series. Richard, {{the first player to}} score 500 career goals in NHL history, retired in 1960 with 544 career goals and was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961. The customary three-year waiting period was waived in honour of his accomplishments.|$|E
5|$|Casting English-speaking lead {{actors in}} Spaghetti Westerns was a growing {{practice}} {{because it was}} believed to allow international marketability. Marcello Mastroianni had conceived {{the idea of a}} mute gunfighter when he told Corbucci that he had always wanted to appear in a Western, but would have been held back by his inability to speak English. When Corbucci first met Jean-Louis Trintignant, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>hired</b> for the leading role of the film by Les Films Corona after it was turned down by Franco Nero (who had previously played the title character of Django), he learned that Trintignant did not speak English either. To bypass the need for an English-speaking lead, Corbucci decided to turn Trintignant's character into a mute. At the time, Trintignant was known {{for his role in the}} critically acclaimed romantic drama A Man and a Woman, and is believed to have accepted the role in support of co-producer Robert Dorfmann, who was a friend of his. Silence was his only role in a Spaghetti Western.|$|E

5|$|Teaff is {{the all-time}} leader in years coached (21), games coached (239), and wins (128). R. H. Hamilton {{has the highest}} winning {{percentage}} of any Baylor coach, with a 5–1–1 record (.786) during his two-year tenure. Bill Beall is, in terms of winning percentage, the worst coach the Bears have had, winning only 3 of his 31 games (.097). Of the 25Baylor coaches, 2 have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame: Teaff and Morley Jennings. Teaff is also the only coach to have received any {{coach of the year}} accolades, winning two national coach of the year award in 1974 and the conference coach of the year award twice. The current coach is Matt Rhule, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>hired</b> on December 6th, 2016.|$|E
5|$|The new editor was Ejler Jakobsson, though Pohl {{continued}} to be listed as editor emeritus on the masthead until the July–August 1970 issue. Much of the editorial work was actually done by Judy-Lynn Benjamin, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>hired</b> by Pohl in 1969 as an editorial assistant. The new regime failed to impress readers, and circulation dropped from over 67,000 for the year ending October 1968 to under 45,000 the following year, a drop of over 30%. If went bimonthly in May 1970, as Abramson attempted to juggle the frequency of publication of several of his titles to maximize profits; the page count and price were also adjusted more than once over the next year, again increasing profitability. Abramson also began a British distribution of If, reprinted with a separate cover, priced in British currency. Circulation figures of the time show an increase of about 6,000 copies, but if this includes sales in the UK is not clear.|$|E
5|$|They {{were joined}} by Robert Lewin as writing producer, based on a {{recommendation}} by Justman {{who had worked with}} him previously. Lewin {{was the first person to}} be involved in the series who did not have a background working on the franchise. D. C. Fontana, who had originally been Roddenberry's secretary while working on The Original Series and went on to become the story editor for the show, was also brought onto the staff of The Next Generation. She was also the story editor on the new series, but sought a promised associate producer credit. Non-writing staff who were brought from working on the film franchise included Rick Sternbach and Andrew Probert, as well as Michael Okuda <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>hired</b> as a scenic artist. Roddenberry hired costume designer William Ware Theiss, who had designed The Original Series costumes, while Milkis and Justman recruited art director Herman Zimmerman. Rick Berman joined the team as the liaison between Roddenberry's team and Paramount Television.|$|E

5|$|After the 2004 season, four Trojan {{assistant}} coaches were offered and took jobs elsewhere. The most notable coach lost was offensive coordinator Norm Chow {{who took a}} job in the same position for the Tennessee Titans. Also leaving, were defensive line coach Ed Orgeron, who took the head coaching position at Ole Miss, quarterbacks coach Carl Smith, who became the offensive coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars, and offensive line coach Tim Davis <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>hired</b> by the Miami Dolphins. Carroll rebuilt his staff by elevating Ken Norton, Jr. from graduate assistant to full-time assistant coaching the linebackers, and hiring Steve Sarkisian, who was with the Oakland Raiders in 2004 and was formerly with the Trojans, as quarterbacks coach. Pat Ruel, who was with the New York Giants in 2004, to coach the offensive line, and Jethro Franklin, who spent 2004 with the Green Bay Packers, as defensive line coach, Sarkisian would additionally be named as assistant head coach and Lane Kiffin, wide receivers coach, would add recruiting and offensive coordinating to his duties.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the regular}} season, but before the postseason bowl game, Maryland lost two members of its {{coaching}} staff. On December 5, 2008, the school announced that defensive coordinator Chris Cosh would return to Kansas State to take over as assistant coach and co-defensive coordinator. He joined the staff of the recently re-hired Bill Snyder, who was Kansas State's head coach from 1996 to 2005. Cosh previously served under Snyder as his linebackers coach from 2004 to 2005. For the bowl game, Maryland appointed outside linebackers coach Al Seamonson as the interim defensive coordinator. Maryland also lost its special teams and tight ends coach, Danny Pearman, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>hired</b> by new Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney. Pearman was a Clemson alumnus and played there as a tight end from 1984 to 1987. At Alabama, he coached special teams and the offensive and defensive tackles from 1990 to 1997, during which time Swinney played there as a wide receiver. For Maryland's bowl game, third-year intern Brian White acted as interim tight ends coach, and he assisted head coach Ralph Friedgen in directing the special teams.|$|E
5|$|Established in 1969 as the Pilots in Seattle, Washington, {{the team}} moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin the {{following}} season, which brought top-flight baseball back to Wisconsin {{for the first}} time since the Braves departed after the 1965 season. The Brewers have been members of the National League since 1998; prior to that, the team played as a member of the American League Central Division. As such, they are the only team to appear in the Major League Baseball postseason representing both major leagues. Buck Rodgers and Harvey Kuenn led the team to one American League playoff appearance each, and Dale Sveum led the team to the 2008 National League wild card after replacing the fired Ned Yost with 12 games remaining in the season. Kuenn leads the franchise in playoff wins (6) and is the only manager inducted into the Milwaukee Brewers Walk of Fame, while Garner is the franchise's all-time managerial wins leader (563). The team's current manager is Craig Counsell, a former infielder who played part of his career with the Brewers, and <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>hired</b> after Ron Roenicke was fired on May 3, 2015.|$|E
