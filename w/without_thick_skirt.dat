50|$|The {{solar cycle}} is an {{approximately}} 11-year period of varying solar activity including solar maximum where {{the solar wind}} is strongest and solar minimum where the solar wind is weakest. Galactic cosmic rays create a continuous radiation dose throughout the Solar System that increases during solar minimum and decreases during solar maximum (solar activity). The inner and outer radiation belts are two regions of trapped particles from the solar wind that are later accelerated by dynamic interaction with the Earth's magnetic field. While always high, the radiation dose in these belts can increase dramatically during geomagnetic storms and substorms. Solar proton events are bursts of energetic protons accelerated by the Sun. They occur relatively rarely and can produce extremely high radiation levels. <b>Without</b> <b>thick</b> shielding, SPEs are sufficiently strong to cause acute radiation poisoning and death.|$|R

40|$|Crack-free In 0. 08 Al 0. 25 Ga 0. 67 N {{quaternary}} films, {{with and}} <b>without</b> <b>thick</b> (> 1. 5 mum) high-temperature-GaN (HTGaN) interlayer, have been grown on Si(1 1 1) substrates by a low-pressure metalorganic {{chemical vapor deposition}} (MOCVD) system. Mole fractions of In and Al in quaternary alloy layers are determined by Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), which are recorded as similar to 8 % and similar to 25 - 27 %, respectively. High-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) and room temperature photoluminescence (RT-PL) results evidence the film's single crystal structure {{and the existence of}} local In- and/or Al-rich regions. Compared with GaN film grwon on Si(1 1 1) substrate, no crack is observed in the quaternary ones. Two explanations are proposed. First, mismatch-induced strain is relaxed significantly due to gradual changes of In concentration. Second, the weak In-N bond is likely to break when the sample is cooled down to the room temperature, which is expected to favor the releasing of thermal stress. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In this article, {{we explore}} the {{kinematics}} of timelike geodesic congruences in warped five dimensional bulk spacetimes, with and <b>without</b> <b>thick</b> or thin branes. Beginning with geodesic flows in the Randall [...] Sundrum AdS (Anti de Sitter) geometry without and with branes we find analytical expressions {{for the expansion}} scalar and comment {{on the effects of}} including thin branes on its evolution. Later, we move on to congruences in more general warped bulk geometries with a cosmological thick brane and a time-dependent extra dimensional scale. Using analytical expressions for the velocity field, we interpret the expansion, shear and rotation (ESR) along the flows, as functions of the extra dimensional coordinate. The evolution of a cross-sectional area orthogonal to the congruence, as seen from a local observer's point of view, is also shown graphically. Finally, the Raychaudhuri and geodesic equations in backgrounds with a thick brane are solved numerically in order to figure out the role of initial conditions (prescribed on the ESR) and spacetime curvature on the evolution of the ESR.
