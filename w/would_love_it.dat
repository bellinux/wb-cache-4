Speculations of her appearance initially surfaced a year {{prior to the}} confirmation, and upon hearing of it, Cougar Town co-creator Bill Lawrence initially supported such allegations. Lawrence stated that he announced that Aniston would appear on the television series, but had not contacted her or her representatives. Eventually, Lawrence averted away from his claims and stated that [...] "nothing's happened yet". He continued in his interview with E! Online: [...] "I'd kill to get Jennifer on the show, and if I had any inclination it was happening, I would be telling everybody 'cause I don't really give a sh-t.

500|$|Despite the {{critical}} success, the third season of Parks and Recreation continued to suffer in the Nielsen ratings, {{just as it}} had during the second season. The average viewership for the 16 episodes of season three were 4.75 million household viewers, a slight increase over season two's 4.68 million average, but lower than season one's average of 5.45 million households. Michael Schur partially attributed the continually low viewership to a decline in ratings for NBC in general, as well as changing viewer trends due to a large amount of available channels. He added: [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> if our ratings went up and up, and we've done {{a pretty good job of}} making our show inviting and friendly, welcoming to new viewers. Other than that, I'm not sure what else we can do. It’s very disconcerting." ...|$|E

After Love {{subsequently}} left the record label, he and Zager formed the Michael Zager Moon's Band in 1976. Love was an habitué of Studio 54 and went to clubs every night. One evening, he went to Greenwich Village to visit several clubs and noted that people were continuously singing [...] "Ooh-ah, Ooh-ah" [...] to every tune which was played in order to increase their own participation and pleasure. The next day, he described the scene to Zager and suggested that Zager write a song incorporating the [...] "Ooh-ah, Ooh-ah" [...] vocals. Zager told Love: [...] "You have to be kidding; that's embarrassing!" [...] Love commented that everybody was doing it and that if Zager wrote a song using these chants, dancers <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

The video for [...] "Down", which features real-life ex-gang members, made its television premiere in June 2004. The single was a mixed success, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart {{during the week of}} July 31, 2004, but quickly falling off afterward. [...] "Always" [...] was announced as the fourth and final single from Blink-182 in August 2004. [...] "It's gonna change people's lives and might actually change the world forever", DeLonge jokingly predicted. After deciding on the video concept, the clip was recorded and released in November 2004 and continued success all the way into January 2005. A fifth single from the album ("All of This") was discussed; however, plans were dropped following the band's declaration of an 'indefinite hiatus' in February 2005. In response to the idea of [...] "All of This" [...] becoming a possible single, DeLonge joked [...] "We <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> because it's a bad-ass song, and The Cure's Robert Smith sings on it, and that makes us cooler than everybody else." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Masterpiece" [...] was {{composed}} by Madonna, Julie Frost and Jimmy Harry and produced by Madonna and William Orbit. When Madonna was directing her film W.E., her manager Guy Oseary persuaded the singer {{to compose a}} song for the soundtrack. Frost was living in Los Angeles {{at that time and}} was assessing her priorities in the music world, and wanted to collaborate with a number of artists, Madonna being the first. [...] "She is an icon", Frost said, [...] "But most importantly she has some of the best Pop songs in the history of music... so yeah it's always a dream to work with people like her." [...] Orbit, who was working with Frost and Harry on an assignment, contacted them for collaborating with Madonna on [...] "Masterpiece". He had heard Frost's initial composition of the song and knew that Madonna <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>it.</b> According to Frost the theme explained to them was about bittersweet love and the hardships felt being in a relationship. Madonna, Frost and Harry sat together with this idea and brainstormed and came up with the lyrics and the melody. Over time, Madonna changed the structure of the song and the final version was ready for recording. Madonna recalled: ...|$|E
500|$|Although Becky Bain of Idolator called Knowles' vocals [...] "gorgeous", {{he gave a}} mixed {{review for}} the song because it [...] "could have been {{recorded}} by anyone and ended with similar results" [...] with the one done by Knowles. Bain stated that Knowles should have [...] "procure more polarizing songs and take bigger risks — at least then half of her fans <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>it,</b> as opposed to her entire fanbase shrugging at everything they hear." [...] NMEs Hamish MacBain classified the song {{as one of the}} [...] "barely distinguishable slowies" [...] and added that the [...] "will to continue listening [...] departs." [...] Andrew Unterberger of the website Popdust gave a negative review for [...] "Start Over" [...] grading it with two out of five stars. Comparing it with Knowles' older material, Unterberger concluded: [...] "Beyoncé tries her best to imbue them with legitimate emotion, especially on the chorus, but it's just not happening this time around." [...] Ricky Schweitzer of the website Beats Per Minute concluded that songs like [...] "I Miss You" [...] and [...] "Start Over" [...] would earn deserved spots in [...] "the Beyoncé pantheon" [...] once fans take the time to grow attached to them. Elan Priya of NME wrote that the song was a [...] "trouble-in-paradise tune" [...] with an [...] "overblown chorus with hair-rock aspirations". However, he commented that the song was [...] "rather buried under sonic bluster".|$|E

500|$|When Chapter 27 premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, {{the film}} was debated {{fiercely}} by critics. A website reported, [...] "the audience's reactions made it obvious that some people <b>would</b> <b>love</b> <b>it</b> and others would not." [...] Andrew O'Hehir from Salon wrote, [...] "Some viewers may well find Chapter 27 sleazy or distasteful, and I won't argue the point. But Schaefer's movie creates its own highly compelling world, which {{is pretty much the}} prime directive in filmmaking." [...] He stated that [...] "Leto almost makes you feel how it happened," [...] and called his acting a [...] "highly compelling performance on many levels." [...] He also enjoyed Lohan's performance. Duane Byrge of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Chapter 27 is a smart attempt to distill the twisted psychology and motivation of Mark David Chapman, which we've all superficially gleaned through mass-media reports and intermittent updates on Chapman's incarceration." [...] He praised Leto's acting saying, [...] "Jared Leto is mesmeric as the bloated, deranged Chapman. It's a brilliantly measured performance, evincing the tale of a madman through his own awful rhyme and reason." [...] He also praised Schaefer's direction, the other cast and crew. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars saying, [...] "By the end of this modest, strange venture, Leto made me believe it was worth being forced to hang out on the sidewalk with this man, if only to get a creeping sense of what that might've been like." ...|$|E

That is, the business part of them, perhaps, <b>would</b> not <b>love</b> <b>it.</b> But the human part would. The human part fairly licks its lips {{at the thought}} of England's ruin. The commercial part, however, quite violently disclaims the anticipations of the human part. And there it is. The newspapers chiefly speak with the commercial voice. But individually, when you are got at in a railway carriage or as now on a ship, up speaks the human voice, and you know how they love you. This is no doubt inevitable. When the exchange stands at a hundred and six men go humanly blind, I suppose, however much they may keep the commercial eye open. And having gone humanly blind they bump into one's human self nastily: a nasty jar. You know then how they hate you. Underneath, they hate us, and as human beings we are objects of envy and malice. They hate us, with envy, and despise us, with jealousy. Which perhaps doesn't hurt commercially. Humanly it is to me unpleasant.|$|R

[...] United won their next five matches and were boosted by the return of Cantona, who made his comeback against Liverpool in October 1995. For much of the season, the team trailed league leaders Newcastle and found themselves ten points behind by Christmas; this later was narrowed to seven points after defeating them on 27 December 1995. The gap increased to 12 points, {{but a series of}} wins, coupled with Newcastle dropping points, meant by late March, United moved {{to the top of the}} table.

Lewis incorporated a substantial beatboxing component, making the song sound significantly different from its original version. Jon Bon Jovi, the lead singer of the band who also coached the contestants that week, noted that Lewis' rendition was [...] "rolling the dice".
