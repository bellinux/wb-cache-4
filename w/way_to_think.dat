25|$|Another <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of {{the proof}} is that B, empty or non-empty, is always in the power set of A. For f to be onto, some element of A must map to B. But {{that leads to a}} {{contradict}}ion: no element of B can map to B because that would contradict the criterion of membership in B, thus the element mapping to B must not be an element of B meaning that it satisfies the criterion for membership in B, another contradiction. So the assumption that an element of A maps to B must be false; and f cannot be onto.|$|E
25|$|The axis of {{symmetry}} of a two-dimensional figure is a line such that, if a perpendicular is constructed, any two points lying on the perpendicular at equal distances from the {{axis of symmetry}} are identical. Another <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{about it is that}} if the shape were to be folded in half over the axis, the two halves would be identical: the two halves are each other's mirror image. Thus a square has four axes of symmetry, because there are four different ways to fold it and have the edges all match. A circle has infinitely many axes of symmetry passing through its center, for the same reason.|$|E

25|$|One <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the Euclidean {{plane is}} {{as a set}} of points {{satisfying}} certain relationships, expressible in terms of distance and angle. For example, there are two fundamental operations (referred to as motions) on the plane. One is translation, which means a shifting of the plane so that every point is shifted in the same direction and by the same distance. The other is rotation about a fixed point in the plane, in which every point in the plane turns about that fixed point through the same angle. One of the basic tenets of Euclidean geometry is that two figures (usually considered as subsets) of the plane should be considered equivalent (congruent) if one can be transformed into the other by some sequence of translations, rotations and reflections (see below).|$|E

She draws upon feminist and ecofeminist literature to conceive of recognition theory beyond intersubjective self/other relations, allowing recognition beyond a human self, a concept which she challenges. Smith seeks to show that recognition theories should not be considered [...] "soft" [...] or [...] "naive" [...] as accounts of justice, and instead that they offer an appropriate mode for thinking about ecological and animal injustices.|$|E

2500|$|The slot-and-state syntax in MCell {{can also}} be used to model multimeric {{proteins}} or macromolecular complexes. When used in this way, a slot is a placeholder for a subunit or a molecular component of a complex, and the state of the slot will indicate whether a specific protein component is absent or present in the complex. A <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about this is that MCell macromolecules can have several dimensions: A [...] "state dimension" [...] and one or more [...] "spatial dimensions". The [...] "state dimension" [...] is used to describe the multiple possible states making up a multi-state protein, while the spatial dimension(s) describe topological relationships between neighboring subunits or members of a macromolecular complex. One drawback of this method for representing protein complexes, compared to Meredys, is that MCell does not allow for the diffusion of complexes, and hence, of multi-state molecules. This can in some cases be circumvented by adjusting the diffusion constants of ligands that interact with the complex, by using checkpointing functions or by combining simulations at different levels.|$|E
