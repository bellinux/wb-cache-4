2500|$|On 31 May Powell gave {{a speech}} at Downpatrick against nuclear weapons. Powell claimed that war could not be banished because [...] "War is {{implicit}} in the human condition". The [...] "true case against the nuclear weapon is the nightmarish unreality and criminal levity of the grounds upon which its acquisition and multiplication are advocated and defended". Thatcher had claimed nuclear weapons were our defence [...] "of last resort". Powell said he supposed this to mean [...] "that the Soviet Union, which seems always to be assumed to be the enemy in question, proved so victorious in a war of aggression in Europe as to stand upon the verge of invading these islands.... Suppose further, because this is necessary to the alleged case for our nuclear weapon as the defence of last resort, that, as in 1940, the United States was standing aloof from the contest but that, in contrast with 1940, Britain and the Warsaw Pact respectively possessed the nuclear weaponry which they do today. Such must surely be the sort of scene in which the Prime Minister is asserting that Britain would be saved by possession of her present nuclear armament. I can only say: 'One must be mad to think it'." [...] Powell pointed out that Britain's nuclear weaponry [...] "is negligible in comparison with that of Russia: if we could destroy 16 Russian cities she could destroy practically every vestige of life on these islands several times over. For us to use the weapon would therefore be equivalent to more than suicide: it would be genocide—the extinction of our race—in the literal and precise meaning of that much abused expression. <b>Would</b> <b>anybody</b> in their senses contemplate that this ought to be our choice or would be our choice?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 1992, when {{living in}} Los Angeles, Kelly {{recorded}} ten tracks {{for his next}} album, Wanted Man, at three studios: Stagg St, Clearlake and O'Henry. Kelly returned to Australia in 1993 and had a book collection of lyrics published, aptly titled Lyrics. In Melbourne he recorded three more tracks at the Metropolis Studio. The album was produced by Kelly, Randy Jacobs (member of [...] Was (Not Was)) and David Bridie (produced My Friend the Chocolate Cake's 1991 self-titled album). Jacobs and Kelly co-wrote [...] "Ball and Chain". The first track, [...] "Summer Rain", deals with a man's yearning for his girlfriend, Kelly thought the sentiment would translate well but found a curious Belgian interviewer asked, [...] "But why <b>would</b> <b>anybody</b> long for rain in summer? ... We get enough rain in winter. We don't want the summer rain. We want the sunshine". The lead single, [...] "Songs from the Sixteenth Floor" [...] was written by Kelly with John Clifforth of Deckchairs Overboard. The next single, [...] "Love Never Runs on Time" [...] was written by Kelly. The lyrics describe a truck driver struggling to meet his commitments to work and family. [...] Kelly uses the same protagonist from [...] "To Her Door" [...] on 1987's Under the Sun and then again in 1996's [...] "How to Make Gravy" [...] from the extended play How to Make Gravy. In the first song, the man moves from being newly married to having children and problems with a drug addiction and undergoing rehab to returning to the family home. By the time of [...] "How to Make Gravy", the man is in prison for assault and is writing {{a letter to his}} brother for Christmas. In 2002 Debbie Kruger of Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA) interviewed Kelly and found, [...] "Kelly’s attraction to the theatrical, however unconscious, has meant occasionally a song’s character will pop up again, sometimes unintentionally". Kelly conceded the three songs were linked, [...] "'I’ve got a feeling it’s the same guy. He keeps coming back'. Maybe he’ll be in a happier place next time? 'Yeah, he’s a bit of a fuck-up, that guy', Kelly laughs".|$|E

60|$|Done in despite of {{the general}} sentiment, the good deed of the {{merchant}} was not, perhaps, without its unwelcome return from the crowd, since that good deed seemed somehow to convey to them a sort of reproach.
