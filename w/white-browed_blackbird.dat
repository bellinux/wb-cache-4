50|$|The white-browed meadowlark (Sturnella superciliaris) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} New World family Icteridae. It {{was formerly}} named <b>white-browed</b> <b>blackbird</b> but is not {{closely related to the}} red-winged blackbird group.|$|E
5000|$|As a group, the meadowlarks {{have had}} a {{volatile}} taxonomic history. When Carl Linnaeus described the eastern meadowlark (the first of the meadowlarks to be scientifically described) in his epic 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758, {{he thought it was}} related to the Old World larks, and so put it in the genus Alauda with them. In the same work, he put the red-breasted blackbird in the bunting genus Emberiza. Less than a decade later, he described the eastern meadowlark again, this time putting it into the starling genus Sturnus, which Juan Ignacio Molina also used when he first described the long-tailed meadowlark in 1782. In 1816, Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot created the genus Sturnella, moving the meadowlarks into his new taxon. Most taxonomists accepted the new genus, and the western meadowlark, Peruvian meadowlark and Lilian's meadowlark were all placed in this taxon when they were later described. When Charles Lucien Bonaparte described the <b>white-browed</b> <b>blackbird</b> and pampas meadowlark, however, he assigned them to another newly created genus â€” Trupialis, for what he called [...] "ground-starlings"; he moved the red-breasted blackbird into that now-defunct genus as well.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, the meadowlarks were split again. Only the [...] "yellow-breasted" [...] meadowlarks (eastern and western meadowlarks, {{including}} Lilian's) {{remained in the}} genus Sturnella. The red-breasted and <b>white-browed</b> <b>blackbirds</b> were moved to the genus Leistes, while the pampas meadowlark, Peruvian meadowlark and long-tailed meadowlark made up the genus Pezites, which was established by Cabanis in 1851.|$|R
