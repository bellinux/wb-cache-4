50|$|In {{commercial}} glazing seals, Santoprene TPV is {{used for}} curtain wall, storefront, architectural window, and skylight <b>weatherseal</b> applications. It is also commonly used in residential glazing seals due to its low air and water infiltration ratings {{for the life of}} window and door systems.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} testing, drivers had road tested prototypes in {{everyday}} conditions including dry weather and dusty condition testing in Madrid, engine testing in Bayonne, cold testing at the Arctic Circle in Norway, suspension testing in Sicily, <b>weatherseal</b> testing in then-Yugoslavia - {{a total of more}} than two million kilometres of road and track testing.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} type are bottom-weighted flaps {{hung from}} the top of the opening, which swing shut on their own, but may be spring-aided to increase wind resistance. These flaps often feature magnets around the edges to help keep the door closed against weather and wind. Some doors have side-mounted hinges and more door-like operation—like a saloon door. These pet doors usually have a spring or other contrivance to force their closure after the pet has gone through. Instead of a rubber flap, saloon style doors are often made from plastic, acrylic, or plexiglas, and the panels are fitted with <b>weatherseal</b> to help keep weather outside.|$|E
50|$|Santoprene TPV {{is used in}} <b>weatherseals,</b> {{underhood}} and under-car applications, {{and interior}} components. In <b>weatherseals,</b> TPV {{is used as a}} lightweight alternative to thermoset rubber materials in semi-dynamic and static parts, while in underhood and under-car applications it is well-suited for air ducts, tubing, molded seals, grommets, suspension bellows, cable jacketing, plugs, bumpers and many other parts. This is due to its sealing performance and resistance to extreme temperatures, chemical exposure and harsh environments.|$|R
50|$|In addition, the K10D {{supports}} in-lens ultrasonic focusing motors, branded SDM by Pentax. Lenses thus equipped support quieter {{and faster}} autofocus operation. Two <b>weathersealed</b> ultrasonic lenses, developed in co-operation with Tokina, have been released.|$|R
50|$|The main {{competitor}} for the D200 was the Canon EOS 30D, {{which had}} {{many of the}} same features. The D200 was also often compared with the Canon EOS 5D, but these two cameras were intended for somewhat different uses - unlike the 30D or 5D, the D200 has <b>weathersealed</b> buttons, allowing it to be used in more demanding outdoor environments.|$|R
50|$|In 1999 Kennedy {{purchased}} the double-glazing manufacturer Everest. He then sold the company off in several instalments. In 2012 his company Latium Holdings also merged with Epwin Holdings. Epwin priced an IPO on 15 July 2014 with a market capitalisation of GBP135 million. In 2006 Kennedy led a takeover of Ultraframe. Brian was the majority shareholder of Entu (UK) Limited until its flotation on the London Stock Exchange (AIM) in October 2014. Brian retained a 30% {{stake in the}} company following the flotation, which was renamed Entu (UK) PLC. The company heads a group of home improvement companies including Zenith Staybrite, Job Worth Doing, <b>Weatherseal,</b> Penicuik and Europlas. At the time of the flotation Entu (UK) had a market capitalisation of £66 million. In property sales, Kennedy is the founder of Patrick Properties, a real-estate company based in Cheshire, which has purchased commercial, residential, and industrial properties.|$|E
40|$|The fourth NASA {{space shuttle}} flight {{incorporating}} redesigned solid rocket motors began on 4 May 1989. The flight motors were designated 360 Q 004 A (left-hand) and 360 H 004 B (right-hand); {{the mission was}} designated STS- 30 R. Overall engine performance was excellent. The low sample rate data that was available showed exceptional propulsion performance. All ballistic and mass property parameters closely matched the predicted values and were well within the required contract end item specification levels that could be assessed. No strain, vibration, or aft skirt heating environments could be addressed due to developmental flight instrumentation deletion. Infrared readings from the shuttle thermal imager were considered very good when compared with ground environment instrumentation readings taken during both the aborted and the actual countdowns. However, hand-held infrared gun reading/ground environment instrumentation comparisons were considered poor during both countdowns, {{with the exception of}} the T - 3 hour timeframe during the actual launch. Postflight inspection again verified superior performance of the insulation, phenolics, metal parts, and seals. All combustion gas was contained by the insulation in the field and case-to-nozzle joints. Inadequate parachute performance on the left-hand booster caused high splashdown loads, which resulted in a displaced nozzle and factory joint <b>weatherseal</b> unbond anomalies. Recommendations were made concerning improved thermal modeling and instruments. The rationale for these recommendations, the dispositions of all anomalies, and complete result details are given...|$|E
40|$|Flight {{motor set}} 360 L 007 was {{launched}} {{as part of}} NASA space shuttle mission STS- 33 R. As with all previous redesigned solid rocket motor launches, overall motor performance was excellent. There were no debris concerns for either motor. Both motors exhibited unbonds on one factory joint <b>weatherseal.</b> All ballistics contract end item specification parameters were verified, {{with the exception of}} ignition interval and rise rates. Ignition interval and rise rates could not be verified due to the elimination of developmental flight instrumentation from fourth flight and subsequent, but the low sample rate data that were available showed nominal propulsion performance. All ballistic and mass property parameters closely matched the predicted values and were well within the required contract end item specification levels that could be assessed. All 108 Ground Environment Instrumentation (GEI) measurements performed properly throughout the prelaunch phase. Evaluation of the GEI measurements again verified thermal model analysis data and showed agreement with predicted environmental effects. No launch commit criteria thermal violations occurred. All joint heaters operated normally, but a high voltage reading was noted on the left hand aft heater, which was immediately determined to be a voltage sensor error and not a heater anomaly due to no current increase. Postflight inspection again verified superior performance of the insulation, phenolics, metal parts, and seals. Postflight evaluation indicated both nozzles performed as expected during flight. All combustion gas was contained by insulation in the field and case-to-nozzle joints...|$|E

50|$|Next to be {{introduced}} was the F3P in 1983. Built primarily for use by photojournalists ("P"ress), the F3P included additional <b>weathersealing,</b> O-ring gaskets, the MF-6 Auto Film-Stop Back, Type-B Matte focusing screen, a modified Titanium DE-5 pentaprism with ISO-type accessory shoe and no eyepiece blind, rubber-covered waterproof shutter release with a modified lockout and no cable release threads, a round frame counter window with white numerals (some have been seen with blue numerals), and an extended shutter speed operating knob for easier operation in cold or wet environments. The F3P lacked a film door release lock, self-timer and multiple-exposure lever.|$|R
50|$|After the war {{the company}} {{expanded}} into making seals {{for all types}} of doors and windows. Schlegel started to make pile weatherstripping and plastic profiles for the building industry. In 1956 the president of Schlegel Manufacturing Company was Carl F. Schlegel, and the Vice President, Research was Norman C. Schlegel. The company's laboratory was investigating industrial textiles, plastics and adhesives. In the 1960s Schlegel introduced a continuous molded urethane process for foam weatherstripping. As of 1973 Schlegel Manufacturing, based in Rochester, New York, was supplying rigid vinyl strips for <b>weathersealing</b> doors. In 1973 it was announced that Schlegel Illinois. Inc., a subsidiary, had introduced a closed-cell sponge rubber gasket for drums.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} U value and energy {{consumption}} of typical curtainwall glazing systems used in commercial buildings. These glazing practices are {{popular in the}} major cities of the world. There are four basic types of systems that are compared.) Glazing systems that use Insulating glass which are mechanically fixed in gaskets, 2) 4 sided structural silicone glazed with wet weatherseals, 3) 4 sided structural silicone glazed with dry gasket <b>weatherseal,</b> and 4) Hybrid glazing system (structurally clamped). The thermal modeling is performed based upon WinIso 2 D using three different IG unit designs {{for the first three}} systems noted above. The IG unit designs evaluated are:) aluminium spacer 2) stainless steel spacer, and 3) warm edge spacer technology. The hybrid glazing system is modeled only with an aluminum spacer. After calculating the U Value for a system, the results can be used to demonstrate how to evaluate the energy consumption for a specific system in a specific location, and compare these results relative to different configurations. This paper details that mechanically fixed systems demonstrate good initial performance, but the aging of gaskets results in shrinkage. Furthermore, compression set of the gaskets allows additional air and water infiltration, rendering the system even less effective. Gasket joint systems also allow additional exposure to the elements of the middle of the aluminum system which further decreases the energy efficiency. Structural glazed systems using the warm edge technology provides an excellent U value and results in the most energy efficient system modeled...|$|E
50|$|The Heart of Midlothian {{young player}} of the year awards took place on 6 April 2013, with Angus Beith, Callum Tapping and Jamie Walker the {{recipients}} of the nights awards. The Heart of Midlothian {{player of the}} year awards took place on 19 May, with Jason Holt winning goal of the year, Jamie MacDonald save of the year, Marius Žaliūkas fans {{player of the year}} and Jamie MacDonald also taking player's player of the year. A special award the Doc Melvin Memorial Award was also given to ex Hearts physiotherapist Alan Rae, and the favourite moment of the year was declared as taking the lead at Anfield against Liverpool in the Europa League.
