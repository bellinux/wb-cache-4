6000|$|... 'Nothing particular, {{poor little}} thing; I believe {{she is always}} on the sofa. My aunt <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> so well as making a great fuss about her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Do {{not believe}} him. You {{do not know}} how vain this fool is. I gave him [...] the feathers, because I thought he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> so well.|$|R
60|$|Minnie {{said that}} she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> better; {{that she did not}} mind the night air; and, as to danger from men, she felt that she should be well cared for in present circumstances.|$|R
5000|$|Colonel Edward: Little {{is known}} about this EUF officer, just that it is clear he hates the Purgatory Squadron and is {{unnecessarily}} rude and who <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> better than to see the squadron fail.|$|R

500|$|When {{the musical}} {{returned}} to New York in 1949, The New York Times reviewer Brooks Atkinson described Carousel as [...] "a conspicuously superior musical play... Carousel, which was warmly appreciated when it opened, seems <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>less</b> than a masterpiece now."

6000|$|... "That will be great, {{if we can}} put it across," [...] {{declared}} Upton, [...] "and I for my part <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> {{better than}} to have the youngster along. It would be {{the event of a}} lifetime for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if he didn't, he's {{very sorry}} for it now. And {{you can take it}} from me, Uncle Barney, that he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> better than to patch up the matter somehow or other, and be friends once more." ...|$|R
60|$|I need hardly {{say that}} Captain Cameron and I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> {{better than to}} organise a {{movement}} of this kind; we would willingly do more good to the West African coast than the whole tribe of its so-called benefactors.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{like old}} Clarke, of Rocksand!" [...] sighed Fred. [...] "I know my system <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> {{better than to}} be re-invigorated with that splendid stuff; but you would know it would put them all in a dreadful state if they knew it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> better, poor fellow. But what {{strange things}} you have seen and done since we met! How little we thought that morning {{that it would be}} six years before we should sit side by side again! And Prince Rupert is kind to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They see well enough, madame, {{that you}} are more {{securely}} held than bolts and bars could detain you. I imagine that they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> better than {{for you to get}} away back to Villeroy, since it would give them an excuse for an attack on the castle." ...|$|R
5000|$|He's the Chief of the Miami City Police and is {{the father}} of Lu. He's a bit tight with money, {{especially}} when payday comes at the department. He also gets a lot of flak about his dated afro hairdo, and <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> more than to get rid of Yao.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll hunt up {{passage on}} some boat," [...] said Foster Portney to the boys. [...] "You remain here and watch our goods. Those fellows {{who lost their}} outfits are angry enough, {{and some of them}} <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> better than to {{appropriate}} ours and let us look to the steamboat company for redress." ...|$|R

2500|$|Summers then {{concluded}} {{his discussion}} of the three hypotheses by saying: [...] So my best guess, to provoke you, of what's behind all of this is that the largest phenomenon, by far, is the general clash between people's legitimate family desires and employers' current desire for high power and high intensity, that in the special case of science and engineering, there are issues of intrinsic aptitude, and particularly of the variability of aptitude, and that those considerations are reinforced by what are in fact lesser factors involving socialization and continuing discrimination. I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> better than to be proved wrong, because I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> better than for these problems to be addressable simply by everybody understanding what they are, and working very hard to address them. Summers then went on to discuss approaches to remedying the shortage of women in high-end science and engineering positions.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Mayor is an uptight, {{selfish and}} {{manipulative}} old tyrant that runs Ravenville. He <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> {{better than to}} ship the monsters off to the arctic, though he has a monster under his own roof - namely the Sea Serpent. Despite his unrivaled hatred of Brady, he is constantly calling him to help as Brady is the best available monster expert.|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} about Himeko Nonohara (野々原姫子 Nonohara Himeko), also known as Hime-chan (姫ちゃん), an aloof, childlike, yet boasty fourteen-year-old girl who frets {{over the fact that}} she is the biggest tomboy in the school.

60|$|Oh! Well may Di lay his loving {{cheek against}} her hand, and run off, and run back, and run round her, barking, and run headlong at anybody coming by, {{to show his}} devotion.

50|$|He has {{a younger}} sister named Thea Stilton, a cousin named Trap Stilton, and a {{favorite}} little nephew, nine-year-old Benjamin Stilton. Geronimo is a nervous, mild-mannered mouse who <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> {{better than to}} live a quiet life, but he keeps getting involved in far-away adventures with Thea, Trap, and Benjamin, and sometimes Aunt Sweetfur. The books are written {{as though they are}} autobiographical adventure stories.|$|R
6000|$|Could Miss Wetherell {{start in}} at once, {{provided}} the committee agreed? Cynthia replied that she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> better. There <b>would</b> be an examination before Mr. Errol, the Brampton Superintendent of Schools. In short, {{owing to the}} pressing nature of the occasion, the judge would take the liberty of calling the committee together immediately. Would Mr. Satterlee and Miss Wetherell make themselves {{at home in the}} parlor? ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} quite agree with little Frenchie in this, because of believing that the curs might find here and there among the privates one who <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> better {{in the way of}} {{pleasure}} than the smoking out of a rebel, and I strained my eyes in every direction that I might have ample warning of the approach of the soldiers. Yet none appeared.|$|R

Acoreus proceeds to give an account of the Nile, including the time and possible causes of its flooding and its course.|$|R
50|$|Mireille is Marise's {{mother in}} law. A stubborn, unhappy old lady, she detests Marise, believing {{that she has}} {{destroyed}} her son Tony's life, ultimately driving him to suicide. Another issue between them is that Marise will not let her see her granddaughter, Rosa, as she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> better than to take full custody of her. Whether she believes it or not, Mireille would tell everyone that Rosa is being mistreated.|$|R
50|$|Thinking {{she will}} do just as well, Fingers demands £25,000 ransom for her safe return. To his surprise, Gordon gleefully refuses. The philanderer has been {{carrying}} on an affair with his secretary and <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> better than {{to be rid of}} his dowdy wife. Fingers desperately lowers his price over and over again, finally offering to give her back for a mere £200, but is turned down.|$|R
50|$|A {{beautiful}} Kabuki {{actress and}} Toshiya's sister. She is very talented and also {{comes from a}} famous family from Rien. At Ryusei's request, she pretended to be his girlfriend so that the media would not bother Akari.

50|$|Like in {{the comics}} and {{animated}} shorts, the films feature Casper, a {{ghost of a}} dead child who refuses to frighten other people and <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>nothing</b> more than {{to be friends with}} them; however, his appearance would often get him shunned and petrified by whoever he encounters, but along the way, he would find and befriend a certain someone he could identify himself with, and would often help that someone in need.|$|R
5000|$|Holt Scotto - Holt is an {{influential}} community member and veteran fisherman {{who does not}} take nonsense from anybody. He is running for public office as harbormaster.

2500|$|Due to her testimony, Still {{and three}} of the dockworkers were acquitted. [...] "Two, John Ballard and William Curtis, were convicted of assault, fined $10, and imprisoned for a week.
