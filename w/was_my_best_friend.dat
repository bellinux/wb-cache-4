2500|$|In remembering Shelly, Ostroy {{said that}} [...] "Adrienne was the kindest, warmest, most loving, generous person I knew. She was {{incredibly}} smart, funny and talented, {{a bright light}} with an infectious laugh and huge smile that radiated inner and outer beauty... she <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> and the person with whom I was supposed to grow old".|$|E
2500|$|Capote based the {{character}} of Idabel in Other Voices, Other Rooms on his Monroeville neighbor and best friend, Harper Lee. Capote once acknowledged this: [...] "Mr. and Mrs. Lee, Harper Lee's mother and father, lived very near. She <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend.</b> Did you ever read her book, To Kill a Mockingbird? I'm a character in that book, which {{takes place in the}} same small town in Alabama where we lived. Her father was a lawyer, and she and I used to go to trials all the time as children. We went to the trials instead of going to the movies." [...] After the Pulitzer Prize was awarded to Lee in 1961 and Capote published In Cold Blood in 1966, the authors became increasingly distant from each other.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Noisey in March 2013, Jourgensen announced that Ministry would break up again, explaining {{that he did not}} want to carry on without Scaccia. He explained, [...] "Mikey <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> in the world and there's no Ministry without him. But I know the music we recorded together during the last weeks of his life had to be released to honor him. So after his funeral, I locked myself in my studio and turned the songs we had recorded into the best and last Ministry record anyone will ever hear. I can't do it without Mikey and I don't want to. So yes, this will be Ministry's last album." [...] The album, titled From Beer to Eternity, was released on September 6, 2013. Jourgensen stated that Ministry would tour in support of From Beer to Eternity, but would not record any more albums. In an April 2016 interview with Loudwire, however, Jourgensen mentioned the possibility of making another Ministry album [...] "if the circumstances are right." ...|$|E

6000|$|Torrance closed one hand. [...] "Grant of Fremont <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> {{and when}} he died I 'most brought the lad up as a son. When he got hold of his foolish notions it hurt me considerably, and I did what I could {{to talk him out}} of them." ...|$|E
60|$|Frankness <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> {{in dealing}} with Castelroux--frankness and his distaste for the {{business}} they had charged him with. As for Marsac and Lesperon, they were both eager enough to have the mystery explained, and when Castelroux having consented--I invited them to my chamber, they came readily enough.|$|E
6000|$|... "Since {{this has}} happened, Una, {{you must be}} told the whole truth; you must listen, and, above all, be reasonable. I am Dick's friend, as I am your own and Terence's. Your father <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> perhaps, and my {{gratitude}} to him is unbounded, as I hope you know. You and Dick are almost as brother and sister to me. In spite of this--indeed, because of this, I have prayed for news that Dick was dead." ...|$|E

60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Ah! {{you must}} be at home to me, Arthur. You <b>are</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend.</b> Perhaps by to-morrow you will <b>be</b> <b>my</b> only friend. My wife has {{discovered}} everything.|$|R

6000|$|... "I have {{no wish to}} {{weary and}} pain you by {{dwelling}} on this part of my childhood in detail. It will be enough if I tell you that I sank lower and lower until I ended in selling matches in the street. My mother's legacy got me many a sixpence which my matches would never have charmed out of the pockets of strangers if I had been an ugly child. My face. which {{was destined to be}} my greatest misfortune in after-years, <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> in those days.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it'll not be soon forgot, as you've come {{in between}} her and me, when she might ha' loved me--it'll not soon be forgot as you've robbed me o' my happiness, while I thought you <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> and a noble-minded man, as I was proud to work for. And you've been kissing her, and meaning nothing, have you? And I never kissed her i' my life--but I'd ha' worked hard for years {{for the right to}} kiss her. And you make light of it. You think little o' doing what may damage other folks, so as you get your bit o' trifling, as means nothing. I throw back your favours, for you're not the man I took you for. I'll never count you my friend any more. I'd rather you'd act as my enemy, and fight me where I stand--it's all th' amends you can make me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly, exactly," [...] {{said the}} old lady, with {{emphatic}} sharpness; [...] "you never thought of me at all. That is the sum and substance {{of what you have}} done. I gave you my confidence. I told you my intentions, my hopes, the plan which was to crown and finish the work of my life. I told you I would make the grandson of the only man I ever loved my heir, and I would do this, because I wished him to marry the daughter of the man who <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend</b> on earth. The marriage of these two and the union of the estate of Cobhurst with the wealth of the Bannisters was a project which, as I told you, had grown dear to my heart, and for which I was thinking and dreaming and working. All this you knew, and without a word to me, and if you speak the truth, all for the sake of your wretched stomach, you clap into Cobhurst a girl who will be engaged to Ralph Haverley in less than a month." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Crazy! The idea! Indeed, Mr. Fairwell, {{these boys}} are not crazy. They <b>are</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friends.</b> They <b>are</b> Tom and Sam Rover, {{and they are}} {{brothers}} to the Dick Rover I told you about." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Please tell me," [...] she said, [...] "did papa, in Rome, {{go to see}} Madame Catherine? He told me {{he would}} if he had time. Perhaps he had not time. Papa likes {{a great deal of}} time. He wished to speak about my education; it isn't {{finished}} yet, you know. I don't know what they can do with me more; but it appears it's far from finished. Papa told me one day he thought he would finish it himself; for the last year or two, at the convent, the masters that teach the tall girls are so very dear. Papa's not rich, and I should be very sorry if he were to pay much money for me, because I don't think I'm worth it. I don't learn quickly enough, and I have no memory. For what I'm told, yes--especially when it's pleasant; but not for what I learn in a book. There was a young girl who <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend,</b> and they took her away from the convent, when she was fourteen, to make--how do you say it in English?--to make a dot. You don't say it in English? I hope it isn't wrong; I only mean they wished to keep the money to marry her. I don't know whether it is for that that papa wishes to keep the money--to marry me. It costs so much to marry!" [...] Pansy went on with a sigh; [...] "I think papa might make that economy. At any rate I'm too young to think about it yet, and I don't care for any gentleman; I mean for any but him. If he were not my papa I should like to marry him; I would rather be his daughter than the wife of--of some strange person. I miss him very much, but not so much as you might think, for I've been so much away from him. Papa has always been principally for holidays. I miss Madame Catherine almost more; but you must not tell him that. You shall not see him again? I'm very sorry, and he'll be sorry too. Of everyone who comes here I like you the best. That's not a great compliment, for there are not many people. It was very kind of you to come to-day--so far from your house; for I'm really as yet only a child. Oh, yes, I've only the occupations of a child. When did YOU give them up, the occupations of a child? I should like to know how old you are, but I don't know whether it's right to ask. At the convent they told us that we must never ask the age. I don't like to do anything that's not expected; it looks as if one had not been properly taught. I myself--I should never like to be taken by surprise. Papa left directions for everything. I go to bed very early. When the sun goes off that side I go into the garden. Papa left strict orders that I was not to get scorched. I always enjoy the view; the mountains are so graceful. In Rome, from the convent, we saw nothing but roofs and bell-towers. I practise three hours. I don't play very well. You play yourself? I wish very much you'd play something for me; papa has the idea that I should hear good music. Madame Merle has played for me several times; that's what I like best about Madame Merle; she has great facility. I shall never have facility. And I've no voice--just a small sound like the squeak of a slate-pencil making flourishes." ...|$|E

60|$|WISE MAN. If {{there is}} one amongst you that believes, he will <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>friend.</b> Surely there <b>is</b> one amongst you. [They are all silent.] Surely what you learned at your mother's knees has not been so soon forgotten.|$|R
