500|$|Adult beetles average [...] {{in length}} and [...] in width. The beetles are orange-yellow in colour with ten {{characteristic}} black stripes on the elytra. The species name decemlineata, meaning 'ten-lined', derives from this feature. Adult beetles may, however, be visually confused with L. juncta, the false potato beetle, which is not an agricultural pest. L. juncta also has alternating black and white strips on its back, {{but one of the}} white strips {{in the center of each}} <b>wing</b> <b>cover</b> is missing and replaced by a light brown strip.|$|E
2500|$|Adults {{are very}} large insects with bodies ranging from [...] {{in length and}} {{antennae}} which can be as long as [...] or 1.52 times longer than {{the body of the}} insect. They are shiny black with about 20 white spots on each <b>wing</b> <b>cover</b> and long antennae conspicuously banded black and white. These beetles can fly, but generally only for short distances, which is a common limitation for Cerambycidae of their size and weight. The upper sections of the legs of the adults are whitish-blue. A. glabripennis can be distinguished from related species by the markings on the wing covers and the pattern of the antennae.|$|E
2500|$|A male cricket [...] "sings" [...] {{by raising}} his wing covers (tegmina) above {{the body and}} rubbing their bases against each other. The wing covers of a mature male cricket have protruding, irregularly shaped veins. The scraper of the left <b>wing</b> <b>cover</b> rubs against the file of the right wing, {{producing}} a high-pitched chirp. Crickets are {{much smaller than the}} sound wavelengths that they emit, which makes them inefficient transducers, but they overcome this disadvantage by using external natural resonators. Ground-dwelling field crickets use their funnel-shaped burrow entrances as acoustic horns; [...] attach themselves to leaves which serve as soundboards and increase sound volume by 15 to 47 times. Chinese handlers increase the apparent loudness of their captive crickets by waxing the insects' tympanum with a mixture of cypress or lacebark pine tree sap and cinnabar. A legend says that this treatment was discovered in the day of the Qing Dynasty, when the Emperor's cricket, held in a cage suspended from a pine tree, was observed to develop an [...] "unusually beautiful voice" [...] after accidentally dipping its wings in tree sap.|$|E

50|$|A close {{relative}} of the rice weevil, the maize weevil has a length of 2.5 mm to 4 mm. This small, brown weevil has four reddish-brown spots on the <b>wing</b> <b>covers</b> (elytra).

Sitophilus zeamais appears similar to the rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae), but has more clearly marked spots on the <b>wing</b> <b>covers,</b> and is somewhat larger. It is able to fly.|$|R

50|$|The striped {{flea beetle}} (Phyllotreta striolata) {{is a small}} flea beetle, shiny black with a greenish tinge, 1.5 to 2.5 mm long, having a wavy amber line running the length of each elytron (<b>wing</b> <b>cover).</b> It is a pest of cabbage and other brassicas. The hind legs are thickened, {{enabling}} the beetle to jump like a flea when disturbed.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{generally}} an oblong, flattened lady beetle species averaging about six millimetres long. Over {{most of its}} range the species is pink in coloration, except for subspecies fuscilabris which is bright orange or red. Each <b>wing</b> <b>cover</b> features 6 black markings. The thorax is a similar shade of red with two large triangular black patches. Similarity is most apparent with the seaside lady beetle, but that species is limited to coastal habitats and features much larger black markings. In that species the apical pair of spots on the elytra {{as well as the}} pronotum markings are merged, unlike Coleomegilla maculata.|$|E

50|$|L. juncta can {{be easily}} {{confused}} with its close cousin the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata. While the adult false potato beetle has alternating black and white strips on its back, just like the Colorado potato beetle, one of the white strips {{in the center of}} each <b>wing</b> <b>cover</b> is missing and replaced by a light brown strip. The eggs are slightly larger and fewer are found in a cluster. The hump-backed larva is similar, but with only one row of dark spots on each side. The two species are apparently incapable of crossbreeding. Of the two, only the Colorado potato beetle is a serious pest.|$|E

5000|$|Adult beetles average 6 - 11 mm {{in length}} and 3 mm in width. The beetles are orange-yellow in colour with ten {{characteristic}} black stripes on the elytra. The species name decemlineata, meaning 'ten lines' derives from this feature.

L. juncta also has alternating black and white strips on its back, {{but one of the}} white strips {{in the center of each}} <b>wing</b> <b>cover</b> is missing and replaced by a light brown strip. [...] The orange-pink larvae have a large, nine segmented, abdomen and black head, prominent spiracles and may measure up to 15 mm in length in their final instar stage. The beetle larva has four instar stages. The head remains black throughout these stages, but the pronotum changes colour from black in first- and second-instar larvae to having an orange-brown edge in its third-instar. In fourth-instar larvae, about half the pronotum is coloured light brown.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a bilevel {{strategy for the}} efficient optimum design of composite stiffened panels using VICONOPT, a fast-running optimization package based on linear eigenvalue buckling theory, and embracing practical composite design rules. Panel level optimization finds a minimum weight cross-sectional geometry based on a substitution of equivalent ortbotropic plates for laminated plates. Optimization at the laminate level finds stacking sequences satisfying laminate design rules. VICONOPT models are validated with ABAQUS finite element models, and with experimental compressive testing of two blade-stiffened panels. The buckling and postbuckling behavior of the two panels, with initial buckling in the stiffeners and skin, respectively, is investigated in a high load and high strain range. The bilevel strategy is evaluated by {{the design of a}} relatively short Z stiffened panel which has been manufactured and tested, and also by design of a long <b>wing</b> <b>cover</b> panel with combined loads. The weight saving from the <b>wing</b> <b>cover</b> panel is 13 % compared with an existing datum design.

None of the impacts produced visible damage. NASTRAN analyses were performed to simulate NDI-detected invisible damage...|$|E
