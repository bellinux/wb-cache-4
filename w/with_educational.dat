5|$|In a {{fundraising}} {{speech on}} 5 October 1843 at the Manchester Athenaeum, Dickens urged workers and employers to join together to combat ignorance <b>with</b> <b>educational</b> reform, and realised {{in the days}} following that {{the most effective way to}} reach the broadest segment of the population with his social concerns about poverty and injustice was to write a deeply felt Christmas narrative rather than polemical pamphlets and essays.|$|E
5|$|Like Usmar Ismail, Djajakusuma was {{influenced}} by realism. However, while Ismail preferred to focus on national-level themes, Djajakusuma was more drawn to simple, locally relevant storylines <b>with</b> <b>educational</b> messages. This realism carried over into Djajakusuma's work in wayang. The settings, traditionally drawn, were instead created as three-dimensional sets, including representations of trees, rocks, and water. According to Soemardjono, who often edited Djajakusuma's films, the director enjoyed experimenting with new techniques to better convey his intentions.|$|E

30|$|The {{existing}} literature on children <b>with</b> special <b>educational</b> needs outside Tanzania {{has focused on}} conceptualization of children <b>with</b> special <b>educational</b> needs and their diversity (Farrel 2003; DfES 2009; Hallahan and Kauffman 2003; Halliwell 2003). Some authors {{emphasize the importance of}} identifying children <b>with</b> special <b>educational</b> needs so as to plan for their intervention services (Bender and Shores 2007); to intervene before they fail (Hus 2001); and to facilitate their proper development alongside their typical growing peers (Fabian and Dunlop 2007). Similarly, available literature on children <b>with</b> special <b>educational</b> needs in Tanzania focuses on the taxonomy of services to these children (segregation, integration, and inclusion) (HAKIELIMU 2008; MOEVT 2016). Despite the fact that the impossibility of providing effective care and services to young children <b>with</b> special <b>educational</b> needs without establishing collaborative relationship with families is acknowledged (Klein et al. 2001), very few studies have been done in Tanzania to examine professional-parents relationship. Thus, this study sought to fill this gap.|$|R

As with the strict education and discipline received by her brothers, Lady Charlotte through the sub-governesses chosen by Queen Charlotte arranged expert tutors to give the princesses lessons in English, French, music, art, and geography; Sophia and her sisters were also allowed to play sports and boisterous games with their brothers. The queen sought to combine her daughters' entertainments <b>with</b> <b>educational</b> benefits. Sophia and her siblings were brought up with an exposure to theatre and were entertained with special performances. Princess Sophia's first appearance in public occurred when she accompanied her parents and elder siblings to a commemoration for George Frideric Handel, held at Westminster Abbey on 26 May 1784.|$|E

5|$|Blake Harrison {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} that would become Flocabulary while in high school. Inspired by hip hop artists like Outkast and A Tribe Called Quest, Harrison wanted to combine the easy retainability of hip hop lyrics <b>with</b> <b>educational</b> content. Harrison graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in English. He then moved to San Francisco, where he met Alex Rappaport, a music graduate of Tufts University. Harrison shared his idea with Rappaport, and in 2004 the two made a demo recording of two songs with a combined total of 80 SAT words. Within two months Sparknotes made the songs available for free streaming, and soon afterward Harrison and Rappaport set up a Flocabulary website. Cider Mill Press published Flocabulary books and distributed them through Sterling Publishing to sell the book at Barnes & Noble and Borders stores. The Hip Hop Approach to SAT Vocabulary sold 10,000 copies in its first year of publication and was reprinted five times. In 2005, Flocabulary went on a promotional tour of concerts at schools.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the most appropriate methods and techniques used for Teaching English to children <b>with</b> special <b>educational</b> needs and to determine whether they should take the courses in foreign languages in mainstream education or with a supporting teacher.

The theoretical part covers suggestions for teaching English to children <b>with</b> special <b>educational</b> needs and the practical part is a comparison between the answers provided by the interviewed teachers and students. The findings conclude that teachers are able to teach regular children simultaneously with mainstream children, though these are reluctant regarding the education of children <b>with</b> special <b>educational</b> needs in mainstream education...|$|R
