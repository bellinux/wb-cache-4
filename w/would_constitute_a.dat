5|$|In September 2007, it was {{reported}} that the U.S. Justice Department has launched a formal investigation into possible campaign finance violations by Hsu and his associates. One focal point for the investigation concerns whether any of the donations by the Paws were reimbursed by Hsu, which <b>would</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> felony. Through his attorney, Hsu has denied any wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of {{the plan}} criticize this tax rebate due to its costs. Economists at the Beacon Hill Institute {{estimated}} the overall rebate cost to be $489 billion (assuming 100% participation). In addition, economist Bruce Bartlett {{has argued that the}} rebate would create a large opportunity for fraud, treats children disparately, and <b>would</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> welfare payment regardless of need.|$|E
5|$|Rumors were {{circulating}} that Muhammad {{was conducting}} extramarital affairs with young Nation secretarieswhich <b>would</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> serious violation of Nation teachings. After first discounting the rumors, MalcolmX {{came to believe}} them after he spoke with Muhammad's son Wallace and with the women making the accusations. Muhammad confirmed the rumors in 1963, attempting to justify his behavior by referring to precedents set by Biblical prophets.|$|E

5|$|Section 4 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 had {{provided}} that two judges or justices <b>would</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> quorum. The practice of sending a single circuit rider was explicitly {{authorized by the}} Judiciary Act of 1793, but was already common before 1793. Under the Judicial Act of 1802, a single judge (either the district judge or the circuit rider) could preside alone.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1877, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B) {{announced}} it would reduce the wages of all workers by ten percent. One hundred miles <b>would</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> day's work, and crews would not receive allowances for time spent on delays at stations. Various meetings of railroad employees followed, and a committee was formed to meet with officers of the railroad. They appealed to the vice president, Mr. King, but he declined to meet.|$|E
5|$|Operation Badr {{called for}} an {{enlargement}} of the bridgeheads on October 8. To accomplish this, {{each of the five}} infantry divisions had to reorganize its forces. Mechanized infantry brigades in the second echelon of divisional lines were to advance between the two forward infantry brigades. Thus the mechanized brigade would form the first line, the two infantry brigades would form the second line, and the reserve armored brigade <b>would</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> third echelon.|$|E

5|$|One {{attempt to}} {{overcome}} these limitations is string theory, a quantum theory not of point particles, but of minute one-dimensional extended objects. The theory {{promises to be a}} unified description of all particles and interactions, including gravity; the price to pay is unusual features such as six extra dimensions of space in addition to the usual three. In what is called the second superstring revolution, it was conjectured that both string theory and a unification of general relativity and supersymmetry known as supergravity form part of a hypothesized eleven-dimensional model known as M-theory, which <b>would</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> uniquely defined and consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E
5|$|The Lords {{would only}} be able to delay money bills for one month, {{effectively}} ending their ability to do so. These were defined as any public bill which contained only provisions dealing with the imposition, repeal, remission, alteration, or regulation of taxation; the imposition for the payment of debt or other financial purposes of charges on the Consolidated Fund, or on money provided by Parliament, or the variation or repeal of any such charges; supply; the appropriation, receipt, custody, issue or audit of accounts of public money; and the raising or guarantee of any loan or the repayment thereof. It did not however, cover any sort of local taxes or similar measures. Some Finance Bills have not fallen within this criterion; Consolidated Fund and Appropriation Bills have. The Speaker of the House of Commons would have to certify that a bill was a money bill, endorsing it with a Speaker's certificate. The Local Government Finance Bill 1988, which introduced the Community Charge ("Poll Tax"), was not certified as a Money Bill and was therefore considered by the Lords. Whilst Finance Bills are not considered Money Bills, convention dictates that those parts of a Finance Bill dealing with taxation or expenditure (which, if in an Act alone, <b>would</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> Money Bill) are not questioned.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of May19 there were further discussions at Rodríguez Peña's house. Saavedra, called by Viamonte, joined the meeting, which {{involved}} military and civilian leaders. They arranged that Belgrano and Saavedra would meet with Juan José de Lezica, the senior alcalde (municipal magistrate), while Castelli would meet with the procurator Julián de Leiva, to ask for their support. They asked the Viceroy to allow an open cabildo, and said {{that if it was}} not freely granted the people and the criollo troops would march to the Plaza, force the Viceroy to resign by any means necessary, and replace him with a patriot government. Saavedra commented to Lezica that he was suspected of betrayal because of his constant requests for cautious and measured steps. This comment was designed to pressure Lezica into speeding up the legal system to allow the people to express themselves, or otherwise risk a major rebellion. Lezica asked for patience and time to persuade the Viceroy, and leave a massive demonstration as a last resort. He argued that if the Viceroy was deposed in that way, it <b>would</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> rebellion, which would turn the revolutionaries into outlaws. Manuel Belgrano gave the following Monday as the deadline to confirm the open cabildo before taking direct action. Leiva would later act as a mediator, being both a confidante of Cisneros and a trusted negotiator for the more moderate revolutionaries.|$|E

25|$|When Muhammad {{expelled}} the Jewish {{tribe of}} the Banu Qaynuqa, the Banu Nadir {{did not get}} involved, viewing the conflict as another example of tribal struggle.

25|$|In early 2008, Conservative MP Ken Epp tabled private member's bill C-484 {{in which}} harming a fetus <b>would</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> crime.

25|$|To {{go beyond}} power set algebras we need another construct. A subalgebra of an algebra A is any subset of A closed under the {{operations}} of A.

25|$|Before the new body's first meeting, Collins, {{tipped off}} by his network of spies, warned his colleagues of plans to arrest all its members in {{overnight}} raids. De Valera and others ignored the warnings on the argument that, if the arrests happened, they <b>would</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> propaganda coup. The intelligence proved accurate and de Valera, along with Sinn Féin MPs who followed his advice, were arrested; Collins and others evaded incarceration.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{plans to}} invest 2 billion USD {{in the water}} and sanitation sector between 2013 and 2030 as part of its program VIDA - Programa Integral Sectorial de Agua y Saneamiento Humano de Nicaragua, which was elaborated as a draft in 2012. The first phase includes about USD 350 million for 2013 to 2017, or about USD 70 million per year. This <b>would</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> significant increase compared to previous years.|$|E
25|$|Rajaraja, {{the clever}} leader he was, {{thought that it}} was in the best {{interests}} of the Cholas to see that the Eastern Chalukyas did not make common cause with their cousins in the west, for such a coalition <b>would</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> challenge to the rising Chola power.

25|$|Two central tools {{employed}} {{for this purpose}} were the Israel Defense Forces, and the education system. The Israel Defense Forces, by means of its transformation to a national army, <b>would</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> common ground between all civilians of the country, wherever they are. The education system, having been unified under Israeli law, enabled different students from different sectors to study together at the same schools. Gradually, Israeli society became more pluralistic, and the 'melting pot' declined over the years.|$|E
25|$|In 1883, church {{president}} John Taylor localized the quorums of seventy. Each stake {{was given}} a quorum of seventy, and seventies in that stake would belong to that quorum. Taylor also prescribed that the senior president of the first 64 quorums could meet with the seven presidents of the first quorum and that <b>would</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> meeting of the first quorum. This never happened, however. This organization continued until church president Spencer W. Kimball's reorganization of the seventies in 1976.|$|E
25|$|Then {{still an}} MP, Osborne was {{announced}} in March 2017 as the next editor of the London Evening Standard, a position which he assumed in May 2017. Critics of his appointment questioned his lack of journalistic experience and his intention to remain MP for Tatton during his tenure with the newspaper, which other MPs said <b>would</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> conflict of interest and devalued {{the role of an}} MP. He was also accused of breaking the post-ministerial employment rules of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments by accepting the editorship without the committee's approval.|$|E
