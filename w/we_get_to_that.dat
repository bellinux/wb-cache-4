40|$|Vivaldi's Four Seasons, or {{at least}} parts of it, can be {{recognised}} by enormous numbers of people on this planet, and its sounds seem to come from almost every elevator shaft, mobile phone, restaurant and television advert in the world.

That {{this may not be the}} case is one of the main points of this paper -�� but before <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> there are two matters that have to be set in place. The first is to define the characteristics of the Four Seasons as a global commodity (note that I refer to it in the singular, since the four individual pieces come as a package); the second is to describe the main tenets of globalization theories and some of their chief generating ideas. Trying to map the characteristics of the work onto the assertions of the theories will be the main business of this paper, and this process is designed not only to illuminate the work, but also to test the theories.

40|$|New {{disruptive}} {{technologies have}} had two major influences on the world of business. Firstly, they have created significantly more efficient mediums of exchange for goods and services, thus enabling individuals to liberate value embedded within many of the assets they own more efficiently. These assets can be either currently recognized, such as stocks and bonds, or unrecognized, what we describe as "new asset classes. " Secondly, they dramatically shifted the focus of power away from those that supply these goods and services to those that buy them. This shift {{has resulted in a}} growing recognition that individuals, as the ultimate benefactors, should also have the option to decide how they wish to liberate the value tied down within the assets they own. They would also {{like to be able to}} decide whether they wish to dispose of the underlying asset outright or secure its future revenue potential. Before <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> stage, however, the current frictions that exist within today's even more efficient financial markets need to be mitigated, if not eliminated. This paper highlights the potential savings that can accrue from eliminating many of the frictions that exist within today's global financial markets and how these savings could impact global liquidity. In addition, this paper describes the process that the "new asset classes" need to go through before they can be truly liberated.

40|$|The Block was Australia 2 ̆ 7 s hit TV show of 2003. Its viewing {{audience}} regularly {{topped the}} 2 million mark, easily surpassing {{all the other}} 2 ̆ 7 lifestyle 2 ̆ 7 shows - DIY Rescue, Burke 2 ̆ 7 s Backyard, Backyard Blitz, Changing Rooms, Better Homes and Gardens, Location Location, Auction Squad, Hot Auctions, the list is practically endless. Australian made TV drama has meanwhile delivered its worst ratings performance in years, virtually guaranteeing The Block {{will not only be}} repeated but cloned as well. David Castran, the managing director of Audience Development Australia, explains it this way: 2 ̆ 2 recent world turmoil has brought people closer to home to focus on what they control 2 ̆ 2 such as the colour of the dining room wall and the type of turf you sow in your backyard. Meanwhile social researcher Hugh Mackay attributes the turn toward lifestyle TV to a cultural shift in attitudes. On his view, Australians are becoming 2 ̆ 2 more self-obsessed and less compassionate 2 ̆ 2. 1 Why we are so willing and seemingly find so much satisfaction in making these kinds of pronouncements about the deteriorating quality of the national character is a question we will have to come back to because it touches on what I see as one of the central themes of Reality TV, namely civil society. But before <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> I think we need to start with the obvious: no viewer of The Block can have failed to notice, nationally, we {{are in the middle of}} an unprecedented property boom - no state or territory, not even the traditional laggers NT and Tasmania, has been left unaffecte...|$|E
40|$|One current {{signifier}} of {{the contemporary}} phenomena of late capitalism and globalisation is the challenges and opportunities engaging universities in Western nations. At the same time, the forms taken by those challenges and opportunities, and the drivers that frame their enactments, display distinctly regional, national and local touches and traces. This situation suggests that British and Australian universities have much to learn from one another. Even if the journey being travelled is similar, the itineraries can vary, affording {{the prospect of the}} mutually beneficial communication of “Interesting detour over here”, “Avoid that section of road like the plague” and “Let’s meet for some refreshments when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> point”. This paper examines five issues currently confronting British and Australian universities alike that encapsulate many of the challenges and opportunities that can provide the basis for such mutually beneficial dialogue and reflection: •	The commercialisation and internationalisation of university teaching and learning; •	Changes and constants in students’ attrition and retention; •	Changes and constants in academics’ working lives and identities; •	The application and impact of online learning management systems in and on universities; •	The promotion of the scholarship of university teaching and learning. The paper illustrates this examination by referring to two not necessarily consonant sites of policy formation about universities: •	The Australian Government (through initiatives such as the Australian Universities Quality Agency, the Learning and Teaching Performance Fund and the National Institute for Learning and Teaching in Higher Education); •	Central Queensland University (through providing higher education to regional Central Queensland campuses, international students on Australian metropolitan campuses and international students in overseas centres). The paper presents the argument that universities in the early 21 st century – whether in Australia or Britain – must engage proactively with globalised forces and government policies; that they need to develop and extend mutually respectful reciprocity with their multiple communities; and that they should reenergise and regenerate knowledge production and dissemination around ethically responsive and socially attentive scholarships. These are potentially effective strategies for enhancing university teaching and learning. They can also provide the agenda for ongoing and useful conversations and collaborations between Australian and British universities...|$|E
