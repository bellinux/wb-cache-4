40|$|Abstract. It is {{significant}} theoretically {{to study the}} nucleation laws of the phase transformation products of the supercooled austenite. The different iron and steel materials were used to study the nucleation of pearlite, bainite and martensite by QUANTA- 400 environmental scanning electron microscope and JEM- 2100 transmission electron microscope. The results show that, from the high-temperature zone to the low-temperature zone, the nucleation of the transformation products of the supercooled austenite is a gradually evolutionary process from two-phase nucleation to single-phase nucleation. Pearlite nucleates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> austenitic <b>grain</b> boundary, bainite nucleates preferentially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> boundary and sometimes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> interior and martensite nucleates preferentially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interface and generally <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> interior. <b>The</b> preferential nucleation sites are the interface, and with the decrease of the transformation temperature, they gradually shift to <b>the</b> defects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grain</b> interiors, which accord with the general rules of the phase transformation nucleation...|$|R
