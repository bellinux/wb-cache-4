5|$|As {{frigatebirds}} rely {{on large}} marine predators such as tuna for their prey, overfishing threatens to significantly impact on food availability and jeopardise whole populations.

Before he died, Karnath broke the key into sixteen pieces and hid them throughout his castle.

5|$|During the episode, Walter {{is shown}} to be agoraphobic and unwilling to leave his lab after Olivia {{arranged}} his release from a mental asylum. He becomes panicked when he briefly sees images of a man, Peter, in the lab; Olivia attributes this to Walter lacking any foothold in reality. That evening, Walter is preparing for bed while September, outside, readies a device he has assembled to <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> remains of Peter's existence.

Delta subsequently meet CIA agent Jeff Riggs, who is leading a raid on the city's last water supply. Delta aids Riggs {{with the aim of}} crippling the 33rd's operations, but Riggs destroys the supply instead, admitting he wanted to <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> remaining population of Dubai to cover up the atrocities of the 33rd.|$|E
5|$|Houlding died in 1902, and in 1905 the {{ownership}} of the club was restructured. Of the existing 3,000 shares, 2,000 were held by the Houlding family. The club owed a debt of £10,000 to Houlding, and a further £5,000 bank overdraft was guaranteed by his family. The family offered {{to give up the}} 2,000 shares and <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> debt, if the club relieved them of the bank loan guarantee. The board agreed, and a new share issue was released in 1906 with 15,000 shares available for £1 each. Following the share issue, McKenna became chairman of the club.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} {{was able to}} quickly replace lost birds – {{there is a high}} proportion of non-breeding, non-territorial birds able to fill vacant territories. The habitat conserved with gamebirds in mind also suited this species and its prey; gamekeepers' more successful efforts to <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> northern goshawk and pine marten – predators of the Eurasian sparrowhawk – may have benefited it. The population increased markedly when this pressure was relaxed, for example during the First and Second World Wars.|$|E

5|$|The final level {{takes place}} in Washington, D.C. again, where the two antagonists attempt to flee after {{escaping}} from prison.

5|$|A more {{coherent}} Walter explains that, {{according to}} the Observer September, the Observers made the Earth uninhabitable by 2609, and so traveled {{back in time to}} take over the planet themselves. As forces corner the three, Walter sets up an antimatter device to <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Massive Dynamic building and their pursuers. Walter is able to lead Simon and Etta to where Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) and William Bell have been encased in amber. They are able to free Astrid, but as Fringe forces approach they find the equipment to free the others has malfunctioned. Simon sacrifices himself to the amber in order to push Peter free, while Walter severs Bell's hand for an unknown purpose. They escape the area as Broyles and his team arrive, though Broyles finds a piece of licorice, a telltale sign of Walter's presence. As the group travels away from the city, Walter, in an ominous manner, reminds Astrid of what Bell did to Olivia (Anna Torv). Peter then comes to recognize Etta as his daughter, Henrietta, wearing a fired bullet as a necklace.|$|E

5|$|In the {{resulting}} Cabinet meeting on naval deployments on 7 September, Thorneycroft and Mountbatten argued {{the case for}} the forcing of the Strait with the task force, acknowledging that though the carrier would be at risk of severe damage or loss, preventing Sukarno from achieving a victory of brinkmanship was worth the peril. Though Foreign Secretary R.A. Butler strongly represented Begg's argument that the Victorious was too valuable an asset to lose, Thorneycroft's arguments won out. The Cabinet concurred that the ship should not be diverted, as a blockage of the carrier would increase Sukarno's prestige to no end, and approved preparations for Operation Althorpe, a plan to <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian air force in retaliation for an attack. Although no precipitous decision was made, and though the Cabinet had agreed to examine the matter further.|$|E
5|$|On July 3, {{international}} leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their aviation forces {{attack the}} saucers positioned above {{the ruins of}} the cities, but the saucers are protected by force fields. Each saucer launches a swarm of attack fighters, each with its own shield as well, which <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> human fighter squadrons. Captain Steven Hiller, a pilot with the USMC squadron VMFA-314 based out of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the Grand Canyon and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the injured alien pilot and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to Area 51, where Thomas' group has landed. Through Secretary of Defense Albert Nimzicki, they learn that a faction of the government has been involved in a UFO conspiracy since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in Roswell. Area 51 houses the refurbished alien fighter, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash.|$|E
5|$|Ryu fights back to {{the inner}} {{chambers}} of the Ancient Ship of Doom, where he prepares {{to engage in the}} final showdown against Clancy, who has now transmuted into a super bio-noid. Clancy offers Ryu to have him and Irene work for him by his side <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> human race and usher a new age, but Ryu refuses and commences with the final battle. After transforming twice into progressively-stronger versions of himself, Clancy is defeated by Ryu, and Ryu is transported outside the warship and back to Irene; they both watch as the Ancient Ship of Doom is brought down and explodes, and they witness the crumbling of Castle Rock fortress. In the aftermath, Ryu tells Irene that Clancy's and Foster's plan have been foiled, and that mankind will live on and refuse to be part of anyone's evil plans; he adds that mankind would never stoop to a level in which they would completely destroy themselves out of mere ambition. The two watch as the sun rises and as a new day begins.|$|E
