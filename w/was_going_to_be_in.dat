According to Lee, these deletions were due to time constraints caused by a break in filming during March 2007, while Depp's daughter recovered from an illness. Burton's domestic partner Helena Bonham Carter was cast in October 2006, as well as Sacha Baron Cohen. In December 2006, Alan Rickman was cast.

On why this was only used once in the season, DeKnight explained that it had in fact been budgeted to appear several more times, with the effect actually completed at least twice more for the season. It was removed for several reasons, including to avoid taking away the specialty of it, and to maintain the crime drama tone of the series. One instance where it would have been used again was in [...] "Stick", where the audience would have seen how Murdock saw Stick as he threw keys at him, and then when he is older and Stick throws fighting sticks at him and his senses are more refined. In that case, the effect was not finished on time. Another instance was in [...] "The Ones We Leave Behind" [...] when Murdock comes across a Chinese worker and realizes that he has been blinded. The final use of the effect <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> [...] "Daredevil" [...] when the camera pushes in on Page's reaction Murdock telling her that they can work together.

500|$|Many {{familiar}} voices {{inspired the}} animators in their {{creation of the}} characters and helped them shape their personalities.

Harris improvised most of his lines, as he considered the scripted lines [...] "didn't feel natural".

Walt also cast other prominent actors such as George Sanders as Shere Khan and Sebastian Cabot as Bagheera. Additionally, he cast regular Disney voices such as Sterling Holloway as Kaa, J. Pat O'Malley as Colonel Hathi and Buzzie the Vulture and Verna Felton as Hathi's wife. This was her last film before she died. David Bailey was originally cast as Mowgli, but his voice changed during production, leading Bailey to not fit the [...] "young innocence of Mowgli's character" [...] at which the producers were aiming. Thus director Wolfgang Reitherman cast his son Bruce, who had just voiced Christopher Robin in Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree. The animators shot footage of Bruce {{as a guide for}} the character's performance.
