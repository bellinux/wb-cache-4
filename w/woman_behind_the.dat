25|$|Maike Vogt-Lüerssen {{argues that}} the <b>woman</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> famous smile is Isabella of Aragon, the Duchess of Milan. Leonardo was the court painter for the Duke of Milan for 11 years. The pattern on Mona Lisa's dark green dress, art critic Maike Vogt-Lüerssen believes, {{indicates}} {{that she was a}} member of the house of Sforza. Her theory is that the Mona Lisa was the first official portrait of the new Duchess of Milan, which requires that it was painted in spring or summer 1489 (and not 1503).|$|E

500|$|The {{decision}} {{to change the}} album's name {{at the last minute}} resulted in a few different versions of the album. There are also different versions of the album that are unrelated to the title. Regarding the different versions of the album, some of the first pressings of the cassette still contained Five Against One printed on the cassette itself, the first couple of pressings of the cassette do not contain the title printed on the artwork at all, and the lyrics to [...] "Indifference" [...] are included in the cassette version. The first couple of pressings of the CD do not contain the title printed on the artwork at all, and the initial versions of the CD came in an Ecopak, which was a variation on the traditional CD-sized Digipak. While not rare, they went out of print quickly and are now hard to find. The song titles are not printed on the back cover of this version, but the artwork remains the same. The vinyl version has never had the title printed on it, and the cover art on the vinyl copies is different from the CD and cassette. For all versions, the picture of the [...] "elderly woman" [...] changed at some point after the first pressings. Allegedly, the original woman never gave permission for her picture to be used, so Pearl Jam changed the picture to another woman. The difference is easy to spot, as [...] "the new and improved <b>woman</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> counter" [...] is printed below the picture.|$|E

2500|$|Kumashiro's 1974 film, Man and <b>Woman</b> <b>Behind</b> <b>the</b> Fusuma Screen: Enduring Skin (Yojo-han Fusuma No Urabari: Shinobi Hada) starred Nikkatsu's reigning Roman porno Queen, Junko Miyashita. Movie critic Tadao Sato {{called the}} film [...] "a masterful porno film rich in emotion, anarchy, and nihilism." [...] Junko Miyashita won the Hochi News {{award for best}} actress of 1979 after {{starring}} in Kumashiro's Woman with Red Hair (Akai Kami No Onna) (1979), which the Weissers, in their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films call [...] "one {{of the very best}} Nikkatsu pink films." [...] Uncharacteristically for Kumashiro, Woman with Red Hair has a straightforward narrative structure, but Jasper Sharp writes that it is still a [...] "difficult" [...] film for viewers who are not familiar with Kumashiro's work. The story, in which a sexually voracious woman comes to live with a construction worker, can be read either as a male fantasy, or as a story of a woman's search for sexual satisfaction. Roughly one-third of the film takes place in the bedroom, with the claustrophobic atmosphere heightened by such exterior sounds as moaning from neighboring drug addicts, and non-stop rain. [...] Sharp writes that it is perhaps best interpreted as [...] "out-and-out fantasy".|$|E
