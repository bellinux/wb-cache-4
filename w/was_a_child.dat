5|$|Olaf's {{father is}} {{identifiable}} as Gofraid, who was king of Dublin between 920 and 934, and also briefly ruled Northumbria in 927. Gofraid was a grandson of Ímar but no patronymic {{is given in}} the original sources. This may be because he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> of a son of Ímar who never ruled Dublin, or he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> of a daughter of Ímar, which in either case would mean his legitimacy to rule {{in the eyes of}} his contemporaries was dependent on the identity of his grandfather, not his parents. Ímar, possibly identical to Ivar the Boneless, was the founder of the Uí Ímair {{and was one of the}} earliest kings of Dublin in the mid-ninth century.|$|E
