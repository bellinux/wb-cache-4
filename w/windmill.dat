40|$|Even if {{they have}} not read Miguel de Cervantes’s The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha, most people are {{familiar}} with Quixote’s adventure with the <b>windmills.</b> The impact of the episode is undeniable—from the allusive idiom tilting at <b>windmills</b> to Picasso’s famous painting of Don Quixote and his squire, Sancho, with <b>windmills</b> in the background. This project examines why the <b>windmills</b> episode continues to have an impact. Findings suggest that the <b>windmills</b> episode is Don Quixote’s best-known adventure because it transcends time and social class. For example, <b>windmills</b> are still present today, and Don Quixote’s fight with the <b>windmills</b> represents the ever-present struggle between man and machine. Additionally, <b>windmills</b> are typically not owned by individual people, but form part of the environment as icons that appeal to people across centuries and social classes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Windmilling</b> {{tests on}} a {{two-stage}} transonic compressor with a design over-all pressure ratio of 1. 85 produced the following results. The maximum <b>windmilling</b> equivalent speed was 30. 2 percent of design speed, and the maximum <b>windmilling</b> equivalent flow was 57. 4 {{percent of the}} design flow. The maximum flow was limited by choking in the last stator passage. A method was developed for estimating maximum <b>windmilling</b> speed and flow from known compressor design values and geometry for a compressor with exit stators. The method, {{which is based on}} the results of the analysis of the <b>windmilling</b> data, predicts the maximum <b>windmilling</b> equivalent speed within 3. 3 percent and the maximum <b>windmilling</b> equivalent flow within 0. 4 percent.

5000|$|The first {{practical}} <b>windmills</b> were {{in use in}} Sistan, {{a region}} in Iran and bordering Afghanistan, at least by the 9th century and possibly {{as early as the}} 7th century. These [...] "Panemone windmills" [...] were horizontal <b>windmills,</b> which had long vertical driveshafts with six to twelve rectangular sails covered in reed matting or cloth. These <b>windmills</b> were used to pump water, and in the gristmilling and sugarcane industries. The use of <b>windmills</b> became widespread use across the Middle East and Central Asia, and later spread to China and India. Vertical <b>windmills</b> were later used extensively in Northwestern Europe to grind flour beginning in the 1180s, and many examples still exist.

50|$|Although {{their origin}} is unknown, both <b>windmills</b> were first {{recorded}} in the Land Revenue Accounts of 1608. Both <b>windmills</b> were first featured on a 1626 map by William Simplon and included on the Hutchins map of 1710, where they were highlighted as prominent sea navigation landmarks. Although there had been similar <b>windmills</b> in Brittany, the Channel Islands {{and other parts of}} England, the Portland <b>windmills</b> are said to be two of the earliest of their type in the United Kingdom. Having kept the same primitive form throughout their 400-year existence, the <b>windmills</b> were probably built and maintained by island craftsmen and millers. Traditionally the <b>windmills</b> were operated by the Pearce family from the 17th century to the late 1890s, when the two mills ceased use due to cheap mass-produced flour and bread being readily available via Portland's modern rail and road links.|$|R
