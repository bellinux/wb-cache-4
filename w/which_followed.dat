5|$|The Court of Appeal's {{decision}} and the {{amendments to the}} Constitution and the ISA <b>which</b> <b>followed</b> have sparked much academic discourse. The following issues have been raised by commentators.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the compatibility of the {{equations of motion}} <b>which</b> <b>follow</b> from d’Alembert’s principle {{in the case of}} a general autonomous non-holonomic mechanical system in N dimensions, with those equations <b>which</b> <b>follow</b> for the same system by assuming the validity of a specific variational action principle, in which the non-holonomic conditions are implemented by means of the multiplication rule in the calculus of variations. The equations of motion <b>which</b> <b>follow</b> from the principle of d’Alembert are not identical to the equations <b>which</b> <b>follow</b> from the variational action principle. We give a proof that the solutions to the equations of motion <b>which</b> <b>follow</b> from d’Alembert’s principle do not in general satisfy the equations <b>which</b> <b>follow</b> from the action principle with non-holonomic constraints. Thus the principle of d’Alembert and the minimal action principle involving the multiplication rule are not compatible in the case of systems with non-holonomic constraints. For simplicity the proof is given for autonomous systems only, with one general non-holonomic constraint, which is linear in the generalized velocities of the system...|$|R
