5|$|On February 21, 2008, the Automobile Club of Southern California (ACSC) {{became the}} title {{sponsor of the}} raceway, making Auto Club Speedway the track's {{official}} name. The naming rights deal <b>will</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> ten years and is worth an estimated $50 to $75million. In addition to naming rights, the ACSC will have use of the facility for road tests for Westways Magazine and other consumer tests.

5|$|Bolton Wanderers had a {{long-established}} {{partnership with}} sporting goods firm Reebok, which {{was formed in}} the town. Between 1997 and 2009 this partnership encompassed shirt sponsorship, kit manufacture and stadium naming rights. The combined shirt sponsorship (1990–2009) and kit manufacture (1993–2012) deals covering 22 years represent the longest kit partnership in English football history. The stadium's naming rights were held by Reebok since its opening in 1997 and was due to run {{until the end of}} the 2015–16 season. Bolton's kit manufacturer from the 2014–15 season changed to Italian sportswear brand Macron who also manufacture kits for clubs including Aston Villa, Lazio and Napoli. The stadium was also re-branded as the Macron Stadium from July 2014 in an agreement that <b>will</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> an initial four years.|$|E
5|$|The {{repertoire}} of behaviour involves synchronised performances of various actions such as preening, pointing, calling, bill clacking, staring, and combinations of such behaviours (like the sky-call). When a bird first {{returns to the}} colony it will dance with many partners, but {{after a number of}} years the number of birds an individual will interact with drops, until one partner is chosen and a pair is formed. They then continue to perfect an individual language that will eventually be unique to that one pair. Having established a pair bond that <b>will</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> life, however, most of that dance will never be used again.|$|E

5|$|When Robbins wins {{a prestigious}} grant to help treat {{children}} in Malawi, a disgruntled Torres agrees to move there with her, as the position <b>will</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> three years; however, {{her lack of}} enthusiasm causes Robbins to end their relationship and go without her. A heartbroken Torres moves in with Sloan, {{and they have a}} one-night stand. Robbins returns for Torres, apologizing and hoping for forgiveness, but Torres initially rebuffs her, and later reveals that she is pregnant with Sloan's baby. Robbins agrees to raise the child with her, but dislikes that Sloan will be a permanent part of their lives. En route a weekend getaway, Robbins proposes to Torres, but before Torres can reply, the two are in a head-on collision with a truck, leaving Torres severely injured. In an attempt to save her life, obstetrician-gynecologist Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), delivers Torres's premature baby. Torres survives, and agrees to marry Robbins. After twelve weeks of recovery, both Torres and baby Sofia are discharged and allowed to leave the hospital. Torres recovers from her surgery, but deals with the backlash from her mother (Gina Gallego)'s attitude toward the wedding and her granddaughter. Torres and Robbins marry in a garden after the minister's wife falls ill, with general surgeon Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), officiating the ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Dying Light {{contains}} a dynamic {{day and night}} cycle. During the day, the player has {{to go out and}} scavenge for supplies to send back to the safe zones. They can set up traps, save random survivors, and make their way to airdrops. The infected are slow, apathetic, and easily visible, allowing the player to simply make their way past them, but their danger grows in numbers. Players can also use environmental traps, such as spikes and electrified fences to kill the infected. Lead game designer Maciej Binkowski stated that day time <b>will</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> approximately 64 minutes, while night time <b>will</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> approximately 7 minutes. The game also features a physics-based lighting system and a dynamic weather system, which includes a variety of conditions such as fog, rain, and wind.|$|E

25|$|All the {{characters}} immediately feel awe for Aslan. Jadis expresses this as fear and hatred, and before fleeing she assaults Aslan {{with an iron}} bar that she tore from a lamp-post in London. Aslan is unperturbed and continues calling plants and animals into existence. The power of his song {{is so great that}} even the iron bar, dropped on fertile earth, grows into a functioning lamp post, and toffees sprout into fruit trees. Aslan claims the power of his song <b>will</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> a few days.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{creating}} a plaster-cast model, directly on {{the skin of the}} patient’s thorax, can be used {{in the design of the}} implants. The evolution of medical imaging and CAD (computer-aided design) now allows customised 3D implants to be designed directly from the ribcage, therefore being much more precise, easier to place sub-pectorally and perfectly adapted to the shape of each patient. The implants are made of medical silicon rubber which is age-resistant and unbreakable (different to the silicon gel used in breast implants). They <b>will</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> life (apart from the case of adverse reactions) and are not visible externally.|$|E
25|$|After being {{successful}} with recent planning applications, {{the club has}} been able to increase capacity by 1,000 for the 2016/17 season onwards – taking the capacity to 14,500 spectators for home games. The works took place during the 2016 off-season and saw the West Stand partially demolished and improved facilities provided, including bars, food outlets and toilets. The new consents <b>will</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> four years and will enable Bath to focus solely on resolution of a permanent redevelopment solution for the Rec, without on-going debate around temporary stands during this period. Permanent development proposals are intended to be brought forward long before the expiry of the four-year period.|$|E

It will also be the second total eclipse visible from Little Rock in 21 years. Totality <b>will</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> at least 6 minutes along {{the part of the}} path that starts at Camden, Alabama, crossing Florida and ending near the southernmost Bahama Islands. The longest duration of totality will be 6 minutes 5.5 seconds at , which is over the Atlantic Ocean east of Fort Lauderdale and south of Freeport, Bahamas.|$|E
25|$|The Dolmens {{widespread}} in Europe {{and much of}} Asia are interpreted as Neolithic burial chambers. Large boulders make excellent long term markers for important and sacred places, just as burial plots are marked by large stones today. Some petroforms could be close to ancient burial areas, or near sacred areas associated with the dead. Large rocks are a universal marker that can last for generations. Boulders <b>will</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> {{tens of thousands of}} years. In memory of a person or the history about a place, these markers help future generations to learn about the past. These markers help to provide long term memories and reminders of a time long ago.|$|E
25|$|Combat {{is governed}} by a life points system. Every {{combatant}} has a maximum capacity of life points, and dies when their health is depleted to 0. Lost life points can be recovered by consuming certain food or drinks, or casting abilities. Players who die reappear at a respawn point of their choice with their life and skill points restored; however, they drop all but three chosen items, as well as certain common items. Dying spawns a gravestone that will hold all of the player's items and <b>will</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> an allotted time; however, there are situations in which all items will be lost upon death. If the player does not return in time, the grave will collapse and their items will disappear.|$|E

25|$|A main {{consideration}} regarding timber piles is {{that they}} should be protected from rotting above groundwater level. Timber <b>will</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> a long time below the groundwater level. For timber to rot, two elements are needed: water and oxygen. Below the groundwater level, dissolved oxygen is lacking even though there is ample water. Hence, timber tends to last for a long time below groundwater level. In 1648 the Royal Palace of Amsterdam was constructed on 13659 timber piles that still survive today since they were below groundwater level. Timber that is to be used above the water table can be protected from decay and insects by numerous forms of wood preservation using pressure treatment (alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ), chromated copper arsenate (CCA), creosote, etc.).|$|E

500|$|Estonia {{has adopted}} a {{national}} development plan that limits the annual mining of oil shale to 20million tonnes. [...] At this rate, mineable reserves <b>will</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> 25–30years. [...] In 2012, 15.86million tonnes of oil shale were mined. Mining losses were about four million tonnes. As of 2014, five oil shale mines are in operation; three are open-pit mines and two are underground mines. The mines are owned by four companies. Plans for opening several new mines are in the preparatory phase. Historically, the ratio of underground mining to open-pit mining has been approximately even, but as usable deposits {{close to the surface}} become scarcer, underground mining will probably increase.|$|E

500|$|Albatrosses {{are highly}} {{efficient}} in the air, using dynamic soaring and slope soaring to cover great distances with little exertion. They feed on squid, fish and krill by either scavenging, surface seizing or diving. Albatrosses are colonial, nesting {{for the most}} part on remote oceanic islands, often with several species nesting together. Pair bonds between males and females form over several years, with the use of [...] "ritualised dances", and <b>will</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> the life of the pair. A breeding season can take over a year from laying to fledging, with a single egg laid in each breeding attempt. A Laysan albatross, named Wisdom, on Midway Island is recognised as the oldest wild bird in the world; she was first banded in 1956 by Chandler Robbins.|$|E
500|$|On the CBS sitcom, The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon Cooper {{is a fan}} of Firefly.

[...] Upon its cancellation, he brands Rupert Murdoch, the owner of Fox, a traitor. During the second season of The Big Bang Theory, in episode 17 ("The Terminator Decoupling"), Summer Glau appears as herself, encountering Sheldon, Leonard, and their friends on a train to San Francisco. When Raj tries to hit on her he says that although he is an astrophysicist, she was actually in space during the shooting of Firefly.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} funeral, one of Pankhurst's bodyguards from her WSPU days, Katherine Marshall, began raising {{funds for a}} {{memorial}} statue. In spring 1930 her efforts bore fruit, and on 6 March her statue in Victoria Tower Gardens was unveiled. A crowd of radicals, former suffragettes, and national dignitaries gathered as former Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin presented the memorial to the public. In his address, Baldwin declared: [...] "I say with no fear of contradiction, that whatever view posterity may take, Mrs. Pankhurst has won for herself a niche in the Temple of Fame which <b>will</b> <b>last</b> <b>for</b> all time." [...] Sylvia was the only Pankhurst daughter in attendance; Christabel, touring North America, sent a telegram which was read aloud.
