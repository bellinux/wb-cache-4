500|$|Nora Ephron {{wrote the}} {{introduction}} to Beckerman's eponymous 1995 book, which she immediately thought had dramatic possibilities. [...] She identified with the stories in Love, Loss, and What I Wore because the book [...] "is not about fashion; it is about what clothes really are to us, those moments when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> trying to find our identity through them". [...] Soon after its publication, Ephron gave the book to eight of her friends for Christmas. She became interested in writing her {{own version of the}} book. [...] Once she decided to adapt Love, Loss, and What I Wore into a play, she and her sister emailed 100 women for stories.|$|E
500|$|In April 2006, the Flames {{announced}} {{that they would be}} opening a hybrid restaurant, bar and entertainment facility in downtown Calgary on Stephen Avenue. In announcing the venture, Flames' President and CEO Ken King stated: [...] "While hockey remains our core competency, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> seeking new opportunities in which to grow the Flames brand and allow our fans greater opportunities to enjoy hockey. We believe establishing a location outside of the Pengrowth Saddledome to share food, fun and hockey will bring our fans even closer to the team." [...] One year later, in April 2007, Flames Central opened to the public. In 2017, the facility reverted to its original name of The Palace Theatre.|$|E
2500|$|Activists say the {{movement}} is non-violent. According to the ALF's code, any act that furthers the cause of animal liberation, where all reasonable precautions are taken not to harm human or non-human life, may be claimed as an ALF action, including acts of vandalism causing economic damage to their victims. American activist Rod Coronado said in 2006: [...] "One thing that I know that separates us from the people <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> accused of being—that is, terrorists, violent criminals—is {{the fact that we}} have harmed no one." ...|$|E
30|$|Diagnosing {{was not a}} {{distinct}} phase before these cycles, but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>constantly</b> searching for clues which could lead us to improvements of the work process. For this purpose we looked at data from the online ticket system Jira and analyzed surveys and meeting notes. Results of the continuous diagnosing {{will be discussed in}} the related cycles.|$|R
5000|$|... "On {{location}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>constantly</b> concealing double yellow {{lines on}} the roads and pulling television aerials down," [...] continued Crozier. [...] "Road signs were always masked and replaced with period signage. Part of my kit when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> on location was large amounts of camouflage netting, because some stuff we just could not remove, we could only disguise, so this netting was quite popular." ...|$|R

2500|$|In Philadelphia Style {{magazine}} Emily emphasized her organization's personal approach: [...] "We’re {{trying to}} use my story to humanize the disease... People really respond to faces and stories and families in a way that’s different. There are so many important causes out there, but we can touch people’s hearts by making them feel like I could be anyone’s daughter or sister or best friend.'" [...] Yahoo! Health profiled Emily. She said, [...] "My disease is progressing and our race is getting more urgent. We’re doing some really groundbreaking work that is changing the paradigm of how research is done, what gets attention, who the players are, and what the pace of progress is. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> pushing the envelope because I literally don’t have time to wait." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am sure <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> hearing, ma'am, till {{it becomes}} quite nauseous, {{concerning}} {{their wives and}} families,' said Bitzer. 'Why look at me, ma'am! I don't want a wife and family. Why should they?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Brook had {{for some}} minutes played no audible part, but the acute {{observer}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> taking for granted would perhaps have detected in her, {{as one of}} the effects of the special complexion to-day of Vanderbank's presence, a certain smothered irritation. [...] "She couldn't possibly have been able," [...] she now interposed, [...] "with so loose--or rather, to express it more properly, with so perverse--a mother." ...|$|E
60|$|Our course led up some terrific steeps, densely wooded with larches and cedars, and traversed by paths {{which the}} rains had guttered {{and which were}} {{obstructed}} by loose stones. To add to the danger and inconvenience, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>constantly</b> meeting returning tourists on foot and horseback, and as constantly being crowded and battered by ascending tourists who were in a hurry and wanted to get by.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} was premiered on MuuMuse on 31 July 2012. It was {{directed}} by Hindrek Maasik and shot in Cuba. Volkova said of the shooting, [...] "I didn't expect that it would <b>be</b> so hot. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>constantly</b> trying {{to hide in the}} shadows. The sun was just unbearable. I was sweating like a mouse the whole time and my make-up was leaking. It was such a pain to film." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{spent as}} much money as we could, and got as little for it as people could make up their minds to give us. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> always more or less miserable, and most of our {{acquaintance}} were in the same condition. There was a gay fiction among us that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>constantly</b> enjoying ourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did. To the best of my belief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.|$|R
60|$|Take any {{moral or}} {{religious}} book, and, instead of understanding each sentence {{according to the}} main purpose and intention, interpret every phrase in its literal sense as conveying, and designed to convey, a metaphysical verity, or historical fact:--what a strange medley of doctrines should we not educe? And yet {{this is the way}} in which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> in the habit of treating the books of the New Testament.|$|E
6000|$|To this conciliatory and amicable public {{communication}} our sole answer, in effect, is this:--"Citizen Regicides! {{whenever you}} find yourselves in the humor, {{you may have}} a peace with us. That is a point you may always command. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> in attendance, and nothing you can do shall hinder us from the renewal of our supplications. You may turn us out at the door, but we will jump in at the window." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{beauty of}} life is its sudden changes. No one knows {{what is going to}} happen next, and so <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> being {{surprised}} and entertained. The many ups and downs should not discourage us, for if we are down, we know that a change is coming and we will go up again; while those who are up are almost certain to go down. My grandfather had a song which well expresses this and if you will listen I will sing it." ...|$|E
5000|$|The EP {{was written}} and {{recorded}} in Los Angeles which became Birds of Tokyo's home base {{for most of}} 2014. [...] "As <b>we</b> <b>were</b> writing through that time, {{there was so much}} going on for us there in L.A.," [...] Ian Kenny explained. [...] "There was lots of shows and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>constantly</b> {{in and out of the}} studio with a lot of commitments so we felt like fairly restless creatures - and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> considering calling the EP Restless Creatures," [...] he revealed.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2013, Violent Soho {{announced}} that their next album is entitled Hungry Ghost {{and will be}} released on the I Oh You label on 6 September 2013—the first single, [...] "In The Aisle", was released on 8 July 2013. Regarding {{the sound of the}} album, Boerdam asserted in an October 2013 interview: [...] "Theres no reason to lock the band down to that grunge label which <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>constantly</b> given, despite us never using that word. We realised that we didnt care, as long as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> happy with the music <b>we</b> <b>were</b> making." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's very clear; but, as he must go three fathoms to our one, {{running off}} with square yards before such a breeze, I think <b>we</b> should <b>be</b> <b>constantly</b> {{altering}} his bearings to the southward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of Waverley himself {{we shall}} say but little, as his {{character}} {{is far too}} common to need a comment; we {{can only say that}} his wanderings are not gratuitous, nor is he wavering and indecisive only because the author chooses to make him so. Every feature in his character is formed by education, and it is to this first source that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> referred for a just and sufficient cause of all the wandering passions as they arise in his mind.|$|E
60|$|If the Englishman {{is really}} fond of cold baths, he {{ought not to}} grumble at the English climate for being a cold bath. In these days <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> told that we should leave our little special {{possessions}} and join in the enjoyment of common social institutions and a common social machinery. I offer the rain as a thoroughly Socialistic institution. It disregards that degraded delicacy which has hitherto led each gentleman to take his shower-bath in private. It is a better shower-bath, because it is public and communal; and, best of all, because somebody else pulls the string.|$|E
60|$|But even {{in places}} where we have {{appeared}} to be stagnant, {{in the sense of}} not undertaking any new aggressive activities, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> making as a part of our regular warfare new captures from the enemy of souls, maintaining the care of congregations and people linked with us, working at full pressure our social machinery, training the children for future labour, raising up men and women {{to go out into the}} world as missionaries of one kind or another, and doing it all while carrying on vigorous efforts to bring to those who are most needy in every locality both material and spiritual support.|$|E
60|$|The Jury were housed at the London Tavern. We all {{slept in}} one large room on {{separate}} tables, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>constantly</b> in the charge {{and under the}} eye of the officer sworn to hold us in safe-keeping. I see no reason for suppressing the real name of that officer. He was intelligent, highly polite, and obliging, and (I was glad to hear) much respected in the City. He had an agreeable presence, good eyes, enviable black whiskers, and a fine sonorous voice. His name was Mr. Harker.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked why}} things didn't work between Kershaw and Wolf, Kershaw stated [...] "American {{producers}} {{are used to}} having total control over their production. But I {{wanted to have a}} say about my own songs myself. Americans want predictable songs and sounds whereas I chose the opposite. <b>We</b> have <b>been</b> fighting like cats and dogs in that studio, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>constantly</b> clashing. In the end we decided to make a compromise, but with the result that neither of us was happy with the final result. It was all very annoying, but I also learned from it." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a lengthy}} {{interview}} for Chums boys' annual in 1896, Herkomer recalled his childhood: [...] "We had an anxious {{time of it}} when I <b>was</b> a boy. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>constantly</b> in want of money..... I was always inclined to art, and {{as a little boy}} worked principally at my father's bench, but by the time I had turned twelve I had produced quite a number of water-colour drawings. The reputation I gained among my play fellows, however, was as a maker of kites". He also crafted mechanical toys including clowns and wagons to give to his friends.|$|R
60|$|One cheerful {{evidence}} of the decivilization of the Anglo-Saxon race is the late tendency to return to first principles in art, as manifested in substituting noise for music. Herein we detect symptoms of a rapid relapse into original barbarism. The savage who beats his gong or kettledrum until his face is of a delicate blue, and his eyes assert themselves like those of an unterrified snail, believes that musical skill is a mere question of brawn-a matter of muscle. If not wholly ignorant of technical gymnastics, he has a theory that a deftness at dumb-bells is a prime requisite in a finished artist. The advance-in a circle-of civilization has only partially unsettled this belief in the human mind, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> though unconsciously reverting to it.|$|E
60|$|The text of Pope's poems is {{more easily}} settled than elucidated. No other poet so near {{to our own}} time {{presents}} equal difficulties. His satires abound in uncertain allusions, and controverted topics which require {{a large amount of}} illustration and discussion. His philosophy was not understood by himself, and it is a study to disentangle his confused arguments, and interpret his doubtful language. He often expressed his opinions with wilful ambiguity, took refuge in equivocations, or had recourse to falsehoods, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> forced upon perplexing investigations to recover the truth he endeavoured to conceal. Fortunately his best poems and choicest passages are least incumbered with puzzling questions, and his obscurities have not much interfered with his popularity because the mass of readers are content to enjoy the beauties and leave the enigmas unsolved.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{need not}} say that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> talking about you. Now, take care of {{yourself}}, Terence. Bear in mind that, if you get yourself killed, {{there will be no}} more adventures for you--at least, none over which you will have any control. Your cousin has just expressed the opinion that she does not think you were born to be shot; she thinks that a rope is more likely than a bullet to cut short your career. She is writing to you herself; and as her tongue runs a good deal faster than mine, I have no doubt that her pen will do so, also. As you say, with your Portuguese pay and your own, you are doing well; but if you should get pinched at any time, be sure to draw on me, up to any reasonable amount.|$|E
5000|$|Fifty {{years later}} in her {{autobiography}} Meaning A Life (1978), Mary Oppen took note of these times, observing: [...] <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>constantly</b> searching--searching in our travels in our pursuit of friends and in our conversation concerning all that we saw and felt about the world. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> searching {{for a way to}} avoid the trap that our class backgrounds held for us if we relented in our attempts to escape from them ... We had learned at college that poetry was being written in our own times, and that {{in order for us to}} write it was not necessary for us to ground ourselves in the academic; the ground <b>we</b> needed <b>was</b> the roads <b>we</b> <b>were</b> travelling.|$|R
5000|$|Coulter dedicates {{a section}} of the book to {{discussing}} the O.J. Simpson murder case and how, after his acquittal when African Americans were cheering for his release, it led to the shutdown of the [...] "white guilt bank" [...] related to white people feeling [...] "guilty for racial unfairness". She continued saying that [...] "everyone — blacks especially — are better off" [...] because of this and that, afterward, [...] "people weren’t walking on eggshells, you could have then-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani enforcing sane criminal laws in New York and not caring that <b>we</b> <b>was</b> <b>constantly</b> being called a racist by liberals and Al Sharpton".|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} four or five miles the walking was very difficult, {{although}} the grade was tolerably steep. The ground was soft, there were tangled forests of sea-weed, old rotting ships, rusty anchors, human skeletons, and a multitude of things to impede the pedestrian. The floundering sharks bit our legs as we toiled past them, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>constantly</b> slipping down upon the flat fish strewn about like orange-peel on a sidewalk. Sam, too, had stuffed his shirt-front with such a weight of Spanish doubloons from the wreck of an old galleon, that I had to help him across all the worst places. It was very dispiriting.|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{comes of}} the error which I have often deprecated," [...] said the elder Corey. [...] "In fact I am always {{saying that the}} Bostonian ought never to leave Boston. Then he knows--and then only--that there can BE no {{standard}} but ours. But <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> going away, and coming back with our convictions shaken to their foundations. One man goes to England, and returns with the conception of a grander social life; another comes home from Germany {{with the notion of}} a more searching intellectual activity; a fellow just back from Paris has the absurdest ideas of art and literature; and you revert to us from the cowboys of Texas, and tell us to our faces that we ought to try Papa Lapham by a jury of his peers. It ought to be stopped--it ought, really. The Bostonian who leaves Boston ought to be condemned to perpetual exile." ...|$|E
60|$|But it {{is strange}} that while <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> {{in the habit}} of seeing the {{reflection}} of the sun, which ought to be a mere circle, elongated into a stream of light extending from the horizon to the shore, the elongation of the reflection of a sail or other object to one-half of this extent is received, if represented in a picture, with incredulity by the greater number of spectators. In one of Turner's Venices the image of the white lateen-sails of the principal boat is about twice as long as the sails themselves. I have heard the truth of this simple effect disputed over and over again by intelligent persons, and yet on any water so exposed as the lagoons of Venice, the periods are few and short when there is so little motion as that the reflection of sails a mile off shall not affect the swell within six feet of the spectator.|$|E
60|$|This {{points to}} the right answer to another {{question}} that is constantly asked. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>constantly</b> asked whether desultory reading is among things lawful and permitted. May we browse at large in a library, as Johnson said, or is it forbidden to open a book without a definite aim and fixed expectations? I am for a compromise. If a man has once got his general point of view, if he has striven with success to place himself at the centre, what follows is of less consequence. If he has got in his head a good map of the country, he may ramble at large with impunity. If he has once well and truly laid the foundations of a methodical, systematic habit of mind, what he reads will find its way to its proper place. If his intellect is in good order, he will find in every quarter something to assimilate and something that will nourish.|$|E
5000|$|The {{recording}} {{took place}} {{over a period of}} more than 6 months. Don Walker said, [...] "It was a very bad low point for the band. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>constantly</b> touring and when we got a weekend off <b>we</b> <b>were</b> thrown into the studio and expected to be creative." [...] Barnes said, [...] "There are really great songs on that record, but it wasn't the most enjoyable recording process. We wanted to go into Studio One at Alberts, where AC/DC and The Angels were doing great records. We booked, but couldn't get in, so we ended up in Studio Three, which was a new studio and didn't have the same atmosphere." [...] Barnes said of the album, [...] "Breakfast at Sweethearts stunk, and you can spell that f-u-c-k-e-d." ...|$|R
5000|$|While at Harvard, {{he joined}} TeamFranken, {{a group of}} {{students}} who assisted Al Franken in writing his #1 bestseller, Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right. Wikler took a term off to help Franken [...] "through every step of the process" [...] of writing the book. [...] "When I was staying with the Frankens finish the book, we'd get up around 10 or 11 and then work for fourteen or fifteen hours," [...] he told an interviewer. [...] "We'd stop only for meals and a little break before dinner. It was exhausting, but it was also exhilarating, because he's so funny. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>constantly</b> cracking up." ...|$|R
60|$|And at {{the right}} time it came, and most unexpectedly. Fully a month had passed, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>constantly</b> up and down the river, and down and up the bay, with no spare moments to devote to the {{particular}} fisherman who ran a Chinese line in the bight of Turner's Shipyard. We had called in at Selby's Smelter one afternoon, while on patrol work, when all unknown to us our opportunity happened along. It appeared {{in the guise of a}} helpless yacht loaded with seasick people, so <b>we</b> could hardly <b>be</b> expected to recognize it as the opportunity. It was a large sloop-yacht, and it was helpless inasmuch as the trade-wind was blowing half a gale and there were no capable sailors aboard.|$|R
