25|$|Roofing {{shingles}} {{account for}} most of the remaining asphalt consumption. Other uses include cattle sprays, fence-post treatments, and waterproofing for fabrics. Asphalt is used to make Japan black, a lacquer known especially for its use on iron and steel, and it is also used in paint and marker inks by some exterior paint supply companies to increase the <b>weather</b> <b>resistance</b> and permanence of the paint or ink, and to make the color darker. Asphalt is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process.|$|E
25|$|Chlorinated Polyethylene (PE-C) is an {{inexpensive}} material having a chlorine content from 34 to 44%. It {{is used in}} blends with PVC because the soft, rubbery chloropolyethylene {{is embedded in the}} PVC matrix, thereby increasing the impact resistance. In addition, it also increases the <b>weather</b> <b>resistance.</b> Furthermore, it is used for softening PVC foils, without risking the migrate of plasticizers. Chlorinated polyethylene can be crosslinked peroxidically to form an elastomer which is used in cable and rubber industry. When chlorinated polyethylene is added to other polyolefins, it reduces the flammability.|$|E

40|$|The <b>weathering</b> <b>resistance</b> of {{differently}} bonded medium density fibreboards (MDF) was evaluated. The MDF {{were prepared}} using thermomechanical pulps (TMP) from pine and melamine-urea-phenolformaldehyde (MUPF) resin, phenolformaldehyde (PF) resin, tanninformaldehyde (TF) resin, and adhesives based on polymeric 4, 4 ´-diphenylmethandiisocyanates (PMDI) as binders. After outdoor exposure {{for several years}} the unsealed boards were tested regarding the internal bond strength, bending strength and thickness swelling. The results show the outstanding <b>weathering</b> <b>resistance</b> of the boards after outdoor exposure for three years. Especially, the internal bond strength of PF-bonded MDF and the thickness swelling of TF-bonded MDF were remarable...|$|R

25|$|The density {{decreases}} up to a comonomer {{share of}} 10% {{because of the}} disturbed crystal formation. With higher proportions it approaches to the one of polyvinyl acetate (1.17 g/cm3). Due to decreasing crystallinity ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers are getting softer with increasing comonomer content. The polar side groups change the chemical properties significantly (compared to polyethylene): <b>weather</b> <b>resistance,</b> adhesiveness and weldability rise with comonomer content, while the chemical resistance decreases. Also mechanical properties are changed: stress cracking resistance and toughness in the cold rise, whereas yield stress and heat resistance decrease. With a very high proportion of comonomers (about 50%) rubbery thermoplastics are produced (thermoplastic elastomers).|$|E
25|$|The torch for the 1948 London Olympics was {{designed}} by architect Ralph Lavers. They were cast in Hiduminium aluminium alloy with a length of 47cm and a weight of 960g. This classical design of a long handle capped by a cylindrical bowl re-appeared in many later torch designs. The torch used for the final entry to the stadium and the lighting of the cauldron was of a different design, also a feature that would re-appear in later years. This torch did not require the long distance duration or <b>weather</b> <b>resistance</b> of the other torches, but did need a spectacular flame for the opening ceremony. At the Melbourne Olympics of 1956, the magnesium/aluminium fuel used for the final torch was certainly spectacular, but also injured its holder. Runners were also burned by the solid-fueled torch for the 1968 Mexico Games.|$|E
25|$|Marimba {{bars are}} {{typically}} made of either wood or synthetic material. Rosewood {{is the most}} desirable, while Padauk is a popular affordable alternative. Bars made from synthetic materials generally fall short in sound quality in comparison to wooden bars, but are less expensive and yield added durability and <b>weather</b> <b>resistance,</b> making them suitable for outdoor use; marimbas with wooden bars are usually played inside because the bars are susceptible to pitch change due to weather. Bubinga (Guibourtia demeusei) and mahogany have also been cited as comparable to rosewood in quality for use as marimba bars. The specific rosewood, Dalbergia stevensonii, only grows in Southern Guatemala and Belize, formerly the British Honduras. This wood has a Janka rating of 2200, which is about three times harder than Silver Maple. The bars are wider and longer at the lowest pitched notes, and gradually get narrower and shorter as the notes get higher. During the tuning, wood is taken from the middle underside of the bar to lower the pitch. Because of this, the bars are also thinner in the lowest pitch register and thicker in the highest pitch register.|$|E
40|$|Ethylene {{propylene}} diene monomer rubber (EPDM) is {{an excellent}} rubber for outdoor use. Natural rubber (NR) containing EPDM may show improved <b>weathering</b> <b>resistance.</b> EPDM was blended with natural rubber with various blend ratios, after which the processing, cure characteristics, and mechanical properties of the NR/EPDM blends were determined. The results of the experiments show that the tensile strength of the blends progressively decreased with an increased amount of EPDM. The morphology of NR/EPDM blends was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The heat and <b>weathering</b> <b>resistance</b> of the NR/EPDM blends were determined in terms of tensile properties of the blends with various blend ratios. The results showed that with the incorporation of EPDM, the blends possessed better stable tensile strength against thermal and weathering aging than NR rich blends. The effect of methyl methacrylate-butadiene-styrene (MBS) as a compatibilizer in a 50 / 50 NR/EPDM blend on the blend properties has been studied in detail. The addition of the compatibilizer improved the compatibility of the NR/EPDM blends...|$|R

30|$|Calcined ginger nut {{had been}} used as the biding {{materials}} in the building floors of the Dadiwan site in Gansu Qin’an during the Yangshao Period. No matter what percentage of CaO, β-CaSiO 3 and Ca 2 Al 2 SiO 7 was in calcined ginger nut, for thousands of years, the site of housing was buried under loess of farm land of hillside. Non-hydraulic and hydraulic materials mainly changed into porous CaCO 3 through their interaction with CO 2 and H 2 O. So after more than five thousand years, F- 901 floor material at Dadiwan is similar to modern No. 100 cement mortar floor in compressive strength. However for centuries, the Aga soil used in Tibetan building floors and roofs was never burned at high temperature. This material didn’t include non-hydraulic binding material and hydraulic material, thus this building material had low strength and poor <b>weathering</b> <b>resistance.</b> The roofs of temples have to be restored once in three to five years, not only involving {{a lot of work}} and time, and but also increasing cost and damages. Preliminary tests demonstrate the floor and roof material added with powder of 30 % calcined Aga soil as binding material can obviously improve the strength and <b>weathering</b> <b>resistance</b> of materials.|$|R
40|$|With {{the goal}} of {{improving}} the weathering behavior of wood by reducing its hygroscopicity and accompanying dimensional changes, samples of spruce and beech were heat-treated under nitrogen pressure at 175 to 195 C and subjected to natural and artificial weathering. Beech had a significantly lower hygroscopicity and improved dimensional stability after heat treatment and was more resistant to weathering than the unheated control.

40|$|Most flame-retarded polymer {{products}} need to {{be highly}} durable throughout their service lifetime in many demanding applications areas such as construction, transportation, electric equipment, and textiles, where low flammability in combination with high resistance toward oxidative deterioration triggered {{by the action of}} light, heat, and/or mechanical stress is a mandatory quality. To achieve this, it is essential to better understand the overall interplay (both physical and chemical processes) between different components such as different flame retardant structures in their respective polymers and in the presence of coadditives such as processing stabilizers, antioxidants, light stabilizers, metal deactivators, filler deactivators, ultraviolet absorbers, and so on, in the flame-retarded polymer product.

In that way crystallization and solidification processes of the aluminum-substrate itself, resulting in a decrease of the formability, can be prevented. The pre-coated aluminum sheets are extremely shapeable by deep drawing at room temperature to 3 -D-parts without showing any micro-cracks and negligible or no gloss reduction in forming zones...|$|R

50|$|ASA is {{structurally}} {{very similar}} to ABS. The spherical particles of slightly crosslinked acrylate rubber (instead of butadiene rubber), functioning as an impact modifier, are chemically grafted with styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer chains, and embedded in styrene-acrylonitrile matrix. The acrylate rubber differs from the butadiene based rubber by absence of double bonds, which gives the material about ten times the <b>weathering</b> <b>resistance</b> and resistance to ultraviolet radiation of ABS, higher long-term heat resistance, and better chemical resistance. ASA is significantly more resistant to environmental stress cracking than ABS, especially to alcohols and many cleaning agents. n-Butyl acrylate rubber is usually used, but other esters can be encountered too, e.g. ethyl hexyl acrylate. The latter has lower glass transition temperature than the former, -65 °C vs -45 °C, providing better low-temperature properties to the material.|$|R
