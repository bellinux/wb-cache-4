5|$|For the {{construction}} of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce the noise levels in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and neoprene pads. Continuously <b>welded</b> <b>rail,</b> which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change {{that is going to be}} made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have the ceilings lined with absorbent fiberglass or mineral wool that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders. The Second Avenue Subway has the first stations to test this technology.|$|E

25|$|On 16 February 1980, at Bushey, {{a broken}} <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> caused a train hauled by 87007 to derail at 96mph, {{injuring}} 19 passengers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>welds</b> (where <b>rail</b> {{sections}} {{are joined}} by welding) may fail due to poor workmanship; this may be triggered by extremely cold weather or improper stressing of continuously <b>welded</b> <b>rails,</b> such that high tensile forces are generated in the rails.|$|R

25|$|In 1981, the MTA began {{installing}} <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> {{on a few}} underground {{portions of}} the system.|$|R
25|$|In 2005 and 2007, Amtrak {{replaced}} the ties on the bridge, installed continuous <b>welded</b> <b>rail,</b> and installed new deck-level maintenance walkways, changes meant {{to extend the}} life of the bridge by 20 to 25 years.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance of {{the line}} was improved, {{inspection}} techniques and jointing methods were revised, and plans for replacing jointed track by continuous <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> were accelerated. Concrete sleepers were banned at rail joints on the Southern Region.|$|E
25|$|High-speed trains {{normally}} {{operate on}} standard gauge tracks of continuously <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> on grade-separated right-of-way that incorporates a large turning radius in its design. While high-speed rail {{is most often}} designed for passenger travel, some high-speed systems also offer freight service.|$|E
5|$|Barium {{peroxide}} is {{a catalyst}} in the aluminothermic reaction (thermite) for <b>welding</b> <b>rail</b> tracks. It {{is also a}} green flare in tracer ammunition and a bleaching agent.|$|R
50|$|The X2 was {{designed}} for old main lines with tight curves and with continuously <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> (the train has a maximum axle load of 17 t, which causes large forces on the track). However, since 1990 {{a lot of new}} high speed lines have been constructed in Sweden, both upgraded lines and new lines. These upgraded or new lines always have ATC, continuously <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> on concrete sleepers and no crossings with road and rail at the same level. The tilting function is not used on these lines.|$|R
50|$|Unlike track circuits, axle {{counters}} {{do not require}} insulated rail joints to be installed. This avoids breaking the continuity of long <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> for insulated joints to be inserted.|$|R
25|$|A {{major problem}} of jointed track is {{cracking}} around the bolt holes, {{which can lead}} to breaking of the rail head (the running surface). This was the cause of the Hither Green rail crash which caused British Railways to begin converting much of its track to continuous <b>welded</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{derailment}} {{was found}} to be due to a broken rail. The Ministry of Transport report criticised the maintenance of the line, especially following a recent increase of the maximum speed of trains over the route. Following the accident the maintenance of the line was improved and plans accelerated for replacing jointed track by continuous <b>welded</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, Amtrak {{upgraded}} the NEC {{north of}} New York to ready {{it for the}} higher-speed Acela Express trains. Dubbed the Northeast High Speed Rail Improvement Program (NHRIP), the effort eliminated grade crossings, rebuilt some bridges, and modified some curves. Concrete railroad ties replaced wood ties, and heavier continuous <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> (CWR) was laid down.|$|E
50|$|The up track (to Leeds) is {{currently}} laid with continuously welding track on concrete sleepers and the down track (to Harrogate) {{is currently}} laid with continuously <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> with steel sleepers.|$|R
40|$|Flash {{butt welding}} is {{commonly}} used {{in the manufacture of}} continuously <b>welded</b> <b>rails.</b> It is a resistance welding method, often performed in stationary plants, which consists of electrical heating and hydraulic forging of the rail ends. This method introduces a residual stress field in the foot, web and head of the rail. This investigation performs an electro-thermo-mechanical analysis using finite element techniques to analyze the residual stress in two continuously <b>welded</b> <b>rails.</b> The residual stress results are compared with ASTM E 837 - 99 standard test data.

40|$|On-site <b>welding</b> of <b>rails</b> is {{currently}} mainly done through manual work by skilled engineers. Fig. 1 shows photos of current grinding work. That <b>rail</b> <b>welding</b> work includes the actual <b>rail</b> <b>welding</b> along with <b>rail</b> grinding. Rail grinding is particularly hard, manual work using a stone grinder in a half-crouched position. It takes approx. 60 minutes to <b>weld</b> single <b>rail,</b> so second <b>welding</b> {{can be done}} only for three sets of rails a day within usual track maintenance time. Improvement of work efficiency thus has been demanded. In the light of that, we decided to develop a rail grinding machine for welds {{for the purpose of}} easing the work and reducing the work time of rail grinding work.

25|$|Since 1983, {{there has}} been {{interest}} from Bucks County passengers in resuming service to Newtown. In anticipation of a possible resumption, SEPTA performed extensive track upgrades in 1984. Street crossings in Newtown and Southampton received brand new <b>welded</b> <b>rail,</b> which were secured using sturdy Pandrol clips vs. traditional rail spikes. Though not promoted, this work was done in order {{to comply with a}} federal grant.|$|E
25|$|Rails are {{produced}} in fixed lengths {{and need to}} be joined end-to-end to make a continuous surface on which trains may run. The traditional method of joining the rails is to bolt them together using metal fishplates (jointbars in the US), producing jointed track. For more modern usage, particularly where higher speeds are required, the lengths of rail may be welded together to form continuous <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> (CWR).|$|E
25|$|The ballast {{also serves}} as a means of drainage. Some more modern track in special areas is {{attached}} by direct fixation without ballast. Track may be prefabricated or assembled in place. By welding rails together to form lengths of continuous <b>welded</b> <b>rail,</b> additional wear and tear on rolling stock caused by the small surface gap at the joints between rails can be counteracted; this also makes for a quieter ride (passenger trains).|$|E
5000|$|The railway {{started as}} 100 m of dual gauge track {{comprising}} [...] gauge rails laid within [...] gauge rails, to permit operation {{of both a}} [...] King Class Locomotive and a [...] Hall class locomotive. The track was unusual in being constructed of continuously <b>welded</b> <b>rails.</b>|$|R
50|$|When <b>welding</b> <b>rails</b> {{together}} {{using the}} Thermite process {{began at the}} start of the 20th century, a section of railhead approximately 3/4 in long, also called a dutchman, was often placed between the sections being joined, with only the web and foot of the rail being new Thermite steel.|$|R
25|$|As {{a part of}} the Keystone Corridor upgrade {{projects}} {{conducted by}} Amtrak and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, the line was upgraded in 2007 with new concrete ties, continuous <b>welded</b> <b>rails,</b> and overhead lines and substations. This upgrade allows SEPTA and Amtrak to operate multiple trains {{at the same time in}} the same manner as that found on the Northeast Corridor.|$|R
25|$|Joints {{are used}} in {{continuous}} <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> when necessary, usually for signal circuit gaps. Instead of a joint that passes straight across the rail, the two rail ends are sometimes cut {{at an angle to}} give a smoother transition. In extreme cases, such as at the end of long bridges, a breather switch (referred to in North America and Britain as an expansion joint) gives a smooth path for the wheels while allowing the end of one rail to expand relative to the next rail.|$|E
25|$|The Delaware and Hudson {{was one of}} (if not) {{the longest}} {{operating}} Class I railroads in American history. While in independent operation the railroad was well managed. In the 1930s, during the Great Depression, D President L.F. Loree ordered many of the railway's larger locomotives to {{be taken off the}} mainline and serviced with the sole reasoning being to keep men working so they didn't lose their jobs. Most of these engines were in excellent condition and didn't need repairs. Also, in 1939, the railroad experimented with <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> before many other railroads.|$|E
25|$|Most modern {{railways}} use continuous <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> (CWR), {{sometimes referred}} to as ribbon rails. In this form of track, the rails are welded together by utilising flash butt welding to form one continuous rail that may be several kilometres long. Because there are few joints, this form of track is very strong, gives a smooth ride, and needs less maintenance; trains can travel on it at higher speeds and with less friction. Welded rails are more expensive to lay than jointed tracks, but have much lower maintenance costs. The first welded track was used in Germany in 1924 and the US in 1930 and has become common on main lines since the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|The new service, named Shinkansen (meaning new trunk line) {{would provide}} a new alignment, 25% wider {{standard}} gauge, continuously <b>welded</b> <b>rails</b> between Tokyo and Osaka using new rolling stock, designed for 250 km/h. However, the World Bank, whilst supporting the project, considered {{the design of the}} equipment as unproven for that speed, and set the maximum speed to 210 km/h.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} promote the phased array {{technology}} {{for the application of}} weld inspection, the advantage of phased array technology was introduced and the application of <b>rails</b> <b>welding</b> inspection with phased array technology was also introduced. Through detecting nature and machining flaws of aluminum-themic <b>welding</b> of <b>rails,</b> contrast to results of conventional ultrasound test, validate the effectiveness of ultrasonic phased array method, concluding characteristics of ultrasonic phased array method for the aluminum-themic <b>welding</b> of <b>rails.</b> From the result of application, the efficiency of weld inspection could be greatly improved and the inspection cost could be greatly reduced by phased array technology...|$|R
50|$|<b>Welding</b> of <b>rails</b> into longer lengths {{was first}} {{introduced}} around 1893, making train rides quieter and safer.|$|R
25|$|On January 1, 1982, the MTA {{implemented}} {{the first of}} its five-year Capital Improvement programs to repair the existing system. Scheduled Maintenance Services were formed to replace components before they failed. Subway cars in classes R26 to R46 went through general overhaul programs to fix and rehabilitate rolling stock. Older equipment (any car classes with contract numbers below R32s on the B Division and R26s on the A Division) were retrofitted with air conditioning. The red tag areas were incrementally repaired and <b>welded</b> <b>rail</b> could be seen on many lines {{by the end of the}} 1980s. At the end of the century, the MDBF rates for the entire system were at record highs and steadily increasing. The Franklin Avenue Shuttle, however, was worse in 1989 than it was in 1980, and necessitated a complete renovation by 1998, because the MTA planned to abandon the line by the end of the century.|$|E
25|$|Amtrak {{provides}} {{service to}} and from Harrisburg. The passenger rail operator runs its Keystone and Pennsylvanian services between New York, Philadelphia, and the Harrisburg Transportation Center daily. The Pennsylvanian route, which operates once daily, continues west to Pittsburgh. As of April 2007, Amtrak operates 14 weekday roundtrips and 8 weekend roundtrips daily between Harrisburg, Lancaster, and Philadelphia 30th Street Station; most of these trains also travel {{to and from}} New York Penn Station. The Keystone Corridor between Harrisburg and Philadelphia was improved in the mid-first decade of the 21st century, with the primary improvements completed in late 2006. The improvements included upgrading the electrical catenary, installing continuously <b>welded</b> <b>rail,</b> and replacing existing wooden railroad ties with concrete ties. These improvements increased train speeds to 110mph along the corridor and reduced the travel time between Harrisburg and Philadelphia to as little as 95 minutes. It also eliminated the need to change locomotives at 30th Street Station (from diesel to electric and vice versa) for trains continuing to or coming from New York. As of Federal Fiscal Year 2008, the Harrisburg Transportation Center was the 2nd busiest Amtrak station in Pennsylvania and 21st busiest in the United States.|$|E
500|$|Once a grand hub, the Coney Island Terminal {{had started}} deteriorating by the 1960s. By 1980, {{the entire system}} {{was in a state}} of disrepair, and the {{terminal}} was no exception. It was slated to be rebuilt that year. According to the New York Daily News, the renovated station would get [...] "a bright, new airy look" [...] as well as one of the system's first installations of continuously <b>welded</b> <b>rail.</b> [...] The steel and concrete station was badly corroded by the effects of salt water and poor maintenance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technology}} was {{almost identical to}} that found on the high-speed lines of France's TGV system.
