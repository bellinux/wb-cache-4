Another setback {{occurred}} in 2009, <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> claimed to have suffered a head injury. The ride was closed indefinitely, with the only reference of its existence appearing on a tombstone outside the new Banshee coaster (showing a simple logo of the ride and the dates 2000-2009). On July 27, 2012, the closure was made permanent, as Kings Island announced that the roller coaster would be dismantled and removed from the park.|$|E

5|$|As a disorganized {{tropical}} cyclone {{in the northeastern}} Caribbean, Rafael produced major flooding across the region. As much as a foot of rain fell across portions of the Lesser Antilles, causing mudslides, landslides, and river flooding. In addition, the heavy rains led to significant crop loss. Sustained winds near hurricane force were recorded on Saint Martin, while tropical storm-force gusts occurred widespread. Lightning activity {{as a result of}} heavy thunderstorms caused many fires and power outages. One fatality occurred <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> in Guadeloupe unsuccessfully attempted to drive her car across a flooded roadway. As Rafael passed just to the east of Bermuda as a hurricane, light rainfall was recorded. Gusts over 50mph (85km/h) left hundreds of houses without electricity. Large swells from the system caused significant damage to the coastline of Nova Scotia, while many roads were washed away or obscured with debris, but overall, damage was minimal.|$|E
5|$|In Tampico, {{near the}} {{location}} of the storm's second landfall, the streets were littered with fallen trees branches, utility poles, and billboards.

One death occurred in Pueblo Viejo <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> was crushed by a tree that fell on her house. Six other deaths occurred in Veracruz, five from a ship capsizing near Boca del Río and another after a person was caught in an undertow offshore Úrsulo Galván.

5|$|After {{reaching}} Lawrence, {{the guerrillas}} immediately killed {{a number of}} Union Army recruits and one of Anderson's men took their flag. The Provost Marshal of Kansas, a Union captain who commanded military police, surrendered to the guerrillas and Anderson took his uniform. (Guerrillas often wore uniforms stolen from Union soldiers.) They proceeded to pillage and burn many buildings, killing almost every man they found, but {{taking care not to}} shoot women. Anderson personally killed 14 people. Although some men begged him to spare them, he persisted, but he relented <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> pleaded with him not to torch her house. The guerrillas under Anderson's command, notably including Archie Clement and Frank James, killed more {{than any of the other}} group. They left town at 9a.m., after a company of Union soldiers approached the town. The raiding party was pursued by Union forces, but eventually managed to break contact with the soldiers and scatter into the Missouri woods. After a dead raider was scalped by a Union-allied Lenape Indian during the pursuit, one guerrilla leader pledged to adopt the practice of scalping.|$|E

In the morning Scully suspiciously asks Mulder if he moved the car in the night. When Mulder tells her he only went out for a paper earlier, she believes he is lying. The next day a similar murder occurs <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> thinks she sees her husband in a hammock with another woman; in reality she has killed her neighbor who was in a hammock with his dog.
