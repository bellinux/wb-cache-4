This study starts with {{the description of the}} working process and the information flow that usually take place in viewed companies. Then, a combined solution of different type of traceability tools are presented and based on these following techniques: (i) the use of passive RFID to trace slabs during manufacturing process and handling, and (ii) the use of laser marking method to create a barcode on end product. Particular relevance is dedicated to the second technology proposed.

Eighteenth century algorithmic {{music is a}} contemporary of automaton machines, like Jacques de Vaucanson's duck or Wolfgang von Kempelen's chess player, or Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage's 1822 difference engine. In 1787, W.A. Mozart (1756-1791) devised an aleatoric system called Musikalisches Würfelspiel (Musical Dice) published 1793 by J.J.

Also, the Bar association at the time was a toothless tiger, unorganized, with no right to discipline its members.” The governor told Baxter and Cleveland (who later served as State Bar president in 1971-72) that his administration would indeed support the unified Bar proposal. He directed his House of Representatives floor leader, future Attorney General Arthur Bolton, and the lieutenant governor, future Supreme Court Justice George T.

5000|$|A written click {{track is}} a method of <b>writing</b> <b>bars</b> of music in {{consistent}} time values (i.e. 4 beats in :02⅔ seconds) to establish a constant tempo {{in lieu of a}} metronome value (e.g. 88 Bpm). A composer would use a written click if they planned to conduct live performers. When using other methods such as a metronome, the conductor has a perfectly spaced click playing in his ear which he conducts to. This can yield stiff and lifeless performances in slower more expressive cues. One can convert a standard BPM value to a written click where X represents the number of beats per bar, and W represents time in seconds, by using the following equation: ...|$|R
