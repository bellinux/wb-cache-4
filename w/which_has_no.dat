Later sources, among them Ovid, Hyginus, and the Bibliotheca of Pseudo-Apollodorus, and in modern literature the English romantic poets like Keats write that although she was tongueless, Philomela {{was turned into a}} nightingale, and Procne into a swallow. Eustathius' version of the story has the sisters reversed, so that Philomela married Tereus and that Tereus lusted after Procne.|$|E
5|$|However, in non-technical {{contexts}} and in {{software for the}} World Wide Web, the term URL remains widely used.

5|$|Periyar viewed Christianity {{similar to}} the monotheistic faith of Islam.

Martin Luther, where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer. Thus, Christian views such as that of Ram Mohan Roy's The Precepts of Jesus has had at least an indirect influence on Periyar.|$|E

5|$|Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan {{languages}} (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), {{also part}} of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain.

The Okinawan Japanese dialect is also spoken in the region. The Ainu language, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> proven relationship to Japanese or any other language, is moribund, with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido. Public and private schools generally require students to take Japanese language classes as well as English language courses.|$|E
5|$|HypSys are {{localised}} in {{the cell}} wall. The precursor for tobacco HypSys is transcribed as a 165 amino acid polypeptide <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> structural homology to the precursor for systemin in tomato. The structural properties of HypSys, containing hydroxyproline and being glycosylated, indicate that they are synthesised through the secretory system. The precursor to HypSys in tomato is a 146 amino acid polypeptide, exclusively synthesised within the vascular bundles of leaves and petioles associated with parenchyma cells of phloem bundles. Unlike systemin, it is primarily associated with the cell wall. The precursors to HypSys appear to represent a distinct subfamily of hydroxyproline-rich proteins found in cell walls. Upon wounding {{it is thought that}} a protease from the cytosol, the cell wall matrix, or the pathogen, processes the precursor producing active HypSys peptides.|$|E

5|$|The UEFA Champions League is a {{seasonal}} association football competition established in 1955. The UEFA Champions League {{is open to}} the league champions of all UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) member associations (except Liechtenstein, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> league competition), {{as well as to the}} clubs finishing from second to fourth position in the strongest leagues. Prior to the 1992–93 season, the tournament was named the European Cup. Originally, only the champions of their respective national league and the defending champion of the competition were allowed to participate. However, this was changed in 1997 to allow the runners-up of the stronger leagues to compete as well. The defending champion of the competition did not automatically qualify until the rules were changed in 2005 to allow title holders Liverpool to enter the competition.|$|E

On 10:20 AM when all the four are safe near the clock tower, a lorry driven by a drunk driver is shown rushing towards them. The biker and Chaitanya jump from the bike, which goes on to hit the lorry tyre, distracting the lorry's path. The four thank Chaitanya who urges them to thank the biker, Akhil.|$|E
5|$|After exit6, Route4 {{passes the}} Rhode Island Army National Guard base {{to the east}} and to the Hunt River to the west. Route4 {{northbound}} interchanges with Route403 at exit7; Route403, or the Quonset Freeway, is a four-lane, limited access freeway and spur route of Route4 that serves the Quonset Business Park and the village of Davisville. Heading southbound, exit7 is split into exit7B, which serves the Quonset Freeway, and exit7A, which serves Route402 (Frenchtown Road), another spur route connecting the highway to US1 and Route2. After exit7, Route4 continues northward as a six-lane expressway, passing farmlands to the west and entering a suburban region of East Greenwich. The highway crosses under an overpass at Middle Road before interchanging with Route401, the freeway's final spur, at another partial cloverleaf interchange. Exit8 is also used to access Route2 and I-95 south, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> direct freeway connection with Route4 north. Shortly after exit8, the Route4 designation ends and the mainline of the highway defaults onto I-95 north.|$|E

5|$|Bulgarian {{folk music}} {{is by far}} the most {{extensive}} traditional art and has slowly developed throughout the ages as a fusion of Eastern and Western influences. It contains Far Eastern, Oriental, medieval Eastern Orthodox and standard Western European tonalities and modes. The music has a distinctive sound and uses a wide range of traditional instruments, such as gadulka, gaida (bagpipe), kaval and tupan. One of its most distinguishing features is extended rhythmical time, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> equivalent in the rest of European music. The State Television Female Vocal Choir is the most famous performing folk ensemble, and received a Grammy Award in 1990. Bulgaria's written musical composition can be traced back to the early Middle Ages and the works of Yoan Kukuzel (c. 1280–1360). Classical music, opera and ballet are represented by composers Emanuil Manolov, Pancho Vladigerov and Georgi Atanasov and singers Ghena Dimitrova, Boris Hristov and Nikolay Gyaurov. Bulgarian performers have gained popularity in several other genres like progressive rock (FSB), electropop (Mira Aroyo) and jazz (Milcho Leviev).|$|E
5|$|In 1993 the {{evolutionary}} biologist Stephen Jay Gould compared Paley to Voltaire's Doctor Pangloss, {{the man who}} could argue any case (however hopeless). Gould is struck that Paley can claim that even the agonising pain of gallstones or gout could indicate the goodness of a loving God, with the justification that it felt so good when the pain stopped. Gould makes it clear he finds Paley's argument incorrect scientifically, but states that he respects it as a coherent and well-defended philosophy. Gould particularly respects Paley's method of identifying alternative possibilities and then systematically refuting them. Gould notes that Paley envisages a Lamarckist kind of evolution and rebuts it with the observation that men have not lost their nipples through disuse. However, Gould writes, Paley did not manage to think of one more alternative, natural selection, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>no</b> purpose at all but just kills off whatever works less well in every generation.|$|E

The N8 road (EN 8), the municipality's main roadway before the A8 motorway was built, crosses the municipality {{from north to south}} through the city centre, connecting with Alcobaça to the north and with Óbidos, Bombarral, Torres Vedras, and Loures—a suburb of Lisbon—to the south. The N114 road (EN 114), in the centre and southeast of the municipality, goes to Peniche, Rio Maior and Santarém. The N114-1 road (EN 114-1), in the centre and east of the municipality, connects the city centre to N114. The N115 road (EN 115), along the south and southwest border of the municipality, goes south to Loures. The N360 road (EN 360) crosses the municipality southwest to northeast through the city, connecting Foz do Arelho to Benedita in Alcobaça Municipality. The N361 road (EN 361), in the southwest of the municipality, connects Lourinhã and Rio Maior.
