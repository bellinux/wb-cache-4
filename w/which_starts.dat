5|$|Mineralocorticoid {{secretion}} {{is regulated}} mainly by the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), {{the concentration of}} potassium, {{and to a lesser}} extent the concentration of ACTH. Sensors of blood pressure in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys release the enzyme renin into the blood, <b>which</b> <b>starts</b> a cascade of reactions that lead to formation of angiotensin II. Angiotensin receptors in cells of the zona glomerulosa recognize the substance, and upon binding they stimulate the release of aldosterone.|$|E

5|$|Evolve {{features}} {{five different}} modes: Hunt, Nest, Rescue, Defend and Arena, which have different objectives {{for both the}} Hunters and the Monster. Evolve provides two different structures to these game modes: Quick Play, <b>which</b> <b>starts</b> a single playthrough match; and Evacuation, {{which serves as a}} five-match, multiplayer story mode. In Evacuation, each match gives the winning side an advantage in the next map, such as having a toxic gas the Monster is immune to, or autonomous gun turrets to assist the Hunters. The Evacuation mode ends with a 'Defend' match. Evolve also features an Observer Mode, allowing players to watch a match without playing in the match. The spectator can jump between cameras and view the match from both the Hunters' and the Monster's perspectives.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Kart is a kart racing game {{featuring}} several {{single and}} multiplayer modes. During the game, players {{take control of}} one of eight Mario franchise characters and drive karts around tracks with a Mario franchise theme. In {{order for them to}} begin driving, Lakitu will appear with a traffic light hanging on his fishing pole, <b>which</b> <b>starts</b> the countdown. When the light turns green, the race or battle officially begins. During a race, the player's viewpoint is from behind his or her kart. The goal of the game is to either finish a race ahead of other racers, who are controlled by the computer and other players, or complete a circuit in the fastest time. There is also a battle mode in which the aim is to attack the karts of the other human players.|$|E
5|$|The middlegame is {{the part}} of the game <b>which</b> <b>starts</b> after the opening. There is no clear line between the opening and the middlegame, but {{typically}} the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed. (Similarly, there is no clear transition from the middlegame to the endgame; see start of the endgame.) Because the opening theory has ended, players have to form plans based on the features of the position, {{and at the same time}} take into account the tactical possibilities of the position. The middlegame is the phase in which most combinations occur. Combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain. Middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent's king. Some typical patterns have their own names; for example, the Boden's Mate or the Lasker–Bauer combination.|$|E

5|$|In {{southern}} Kent County, M-37 follows Cherry Valley Road through Caledonia. As {{the highway}} transitions to Broadmoor Avenue, the landscape also transitions from rural to suburban. North of 76th Street, Broadmoor widens to a four-lane boulevard which passes a campus of Davenport University near the M-6 freeway {{on the outskirts}} of the Grand Rapids area. This section is dominated by light industrial complexes west of the Gerald R. Ford International Airport in the suburb of Kentwood. These complexes change over to retail establishments north of 32nd Street. At 28th Street, Broadmoor Avenue ends, and East Beltline Avenue begins. This same intersection also marks the western terminus of M-44, <b>which</b> <b>starts</b> concurrent with M-37 in Kentwood. These two highway designations follow East Beltline Avenue between the Woodland Mall and the Centerpointe Mall. North of the malls, M-37/M-44 passes through the campus of Calvin College and along residential areas at the east end of Reeds Lake. The intersection of East Beltine Avenue and Fulton Street is the western terminus for M-21, a highway that runs east across the state to Flint. North of this junction, M-37/M-44 meets I-96.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} part of the story, <b>which</b> <b>starts</b> {{immediately}} after the end of the first part but extends into the next seven years, Tomoya and Nagisa start living together, and eventually get married. Tomoya has to endure several hardships that the family has been suffering from, especially Nagisa's illness. Just after Nagisa gives birth to their daughter Ushio, she dies, which causes Tomoya to become severely depressed. He is barely able to function, let alone look after an infant. As a result, Nagisa's parents, Akio and Sanae, take care of their granddaughter. Five years later, Tomoya meets with Shino Okazaki, his paternal grandmother. Shino tells Tomoya of his father's traumatic past, which is eerily similar to Tomoya's current situation. Afterwards, Tomoya resolves to raise Ushio and acknowledges Naoyuki as his father. Shortly after Tomoya overcomes his depression, Ushio is stricken with the same disease that Nagisa had. Tomoya, Sanae and Akio struggle to save her—Tomoya even quits his job—but all of their efforts turn out to be in vain. In the coming winter, wanting to do anything for his daughter, Tomoya takes her on a trip, but she dies shortly after.|$|E
