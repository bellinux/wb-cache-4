5|$|Aircraft {{de-icing}} vehicles usually {{consist of}} a large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a <b>water</b> <b>feed</b> to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft deicing {{vehicles}} {{have also}} improved since the accident, usually {{consisting of a}} large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a <b>water</b> <b>feed</b> to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle. Airport runways are also deiced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are wide enough to cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip {{to take place in}} a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.|$|E
5|$|Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, James Clayton, brought {{functional}} Midland Railway influences to the design, such as {{the shape}} of the cab and the drumhead-type smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. Clayton was also responsible for the tender and chimney designs. Snifting valves were provided to prevent vacuum formation in the cylinders when the locomotive was stationary, and the outside Walschaerts valve gear incorporated single slide-bars and piston tail rods. Innovations added by Maunsell's team included steam-powered locomotive brakes, locating the boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and <b>water</b> <b>feed</b> pipes mounted on either side, and a new type of superheater that segregated saturated and superheated steam. Maunsell also incorporated a screw reverser to control valve events, which was easier to maintain than the complex steam reverser configuration of previous SECR designs. All components were standardised for interchange with similar locomotive classes to ease maintenance and reduce production costs.|$|E

25|$|Following re-assembly, the {{locomotive}} was steam tested at York before transport to Carrog {{station on the}} Llangollen Railway. Early tests showed up two major problems: firstly the linkage to the blower was not strong enough, and secondly operating the <b>water</b> <b>feed</b> pump caused very serious priming of the boiler. It was later shown that the feed pump was five {{times the size of}} that required for the engine. This caused air to be fed into the horizontal boiler tube probably caused the priming.|$|E
25|$|They did not thrive, however, {{and they}} came out of the valley in poor condition, due mainly due to {{insufficient}} number of men to <b>water,</b> <b>feed</b> and groom them and the conditions were unfavourable for exercise, which is essential for keeping horses in good health and condition. There was on average one man to look after six or seven horses, and at times in some regiments there was only one man for every 15 horses after the daily sick had been evacuated and men for outposts, patrols and anti-malarial work had been found.|$|E
25|$|Early boilers used {{seawater}} directly, {{but this}} gave {{problems with the}} build-up of brine and scale. For efficiency, as well as conserving feedwater, marine engines have usually been condensing engines. By 1865, {{the use of an}} improved surface condenser permitted the use of fresh <b>water</b> <b>feed,</b> as the additional feedwater now required was only the small amount required to make up for losses, rather than the total passed through the boiler. Despite this, a large warship could still require up to 100tons of fresh water makeup to the feedwater system per day, when under full power. Attention was also paid to de-aereating feedwater, to further reduce boiler corrosion.|$|E

50|$|The steam is {{provided}} by water {{commonly referred to as}} <b>feed</b> <b>water.</b> This <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> is sea water pumped into the boat and desalinated. The desalinated water is then fed to the steam generators.|$|R
25|$|Biloxi {{departed}} Okinawa on 20 April and steamed east to Ulithi, {{where she}} {{arrived on the}} 24th. After receiving battle repairs alongside , the light cruiser continued east, arriving at San Francisco via Pearl Harbor on 11 May. Moving into the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation yard the warship received three weeks of long overdue repairs and machinery maintenance. Following completion of this work on 6 July, Biloxi conducted two weeks of post overhaul checks and refresher training out of San Diego and San Clemente. These evolutions were disrupted on 14 July when a <b>water</b> <b>feed</b> line ruptured in the aft fire room, flashed into steam and burned eight men, none seriously.|$|E
500|$|At 18:30 on 19 September, the 4th Cavalry Division halted {{for three}} hours to <b>water,</b> <b>feed,</b> and rest. The 11th Cavalry Brigade {{concentrated}} and watered at Tell edh Dhrur; the 12th Cavalry Brigade reached Jelame on the railway north of Qaqun and also watered, while the 10th Cavalry Brigade rode on to Kerkur {{at the entrance to}} the Musmus Pass, [...] north of Tell edh Dhrur. After watering, the 2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse) (10th Cavalry Brigade) pushed forward with the 11th Light Armoured Motor Battery to occupy Kh. 'Ara, [...] north-east of Kerkur and about one-third of the way through the Musmus Pass, at 23:00.|$|E
500|$|Other {{innovations}} by Maunsell's team included greater superheating surface area, {{locating the}} boiler water top feed inside a dome-like cover with external clackboxes and <b>water</b> <b>feed</b> pipes mounted on either side, outside Walschaerts valve gear, and parts {{that could be}} shared with similar locomotive classes to reduce maintenance costs. The firebox was narrower towards the rear and featured a continuously sloping grate, whilst the ashpan was fitted with front and rear damper doors, the latter adjusted to clear the rear driving axle. The {{lower part of the}} coal bunker incorporated a water tank of [...] capacity. This was connected to two [...] side tanks by two rectangular pipes {{on either side of the}} locomotive that also formed supports for the cab footplate.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of {{non-conventional water resources}} in Egypt is essential in order {{to respond to the}} continuously increasing demand. The most advanced and charming desalination system is the reverse osmosis (RO) system. In this paper, the effect of the <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> temperature, the <b>feed</b> pressure, the inlet pH and the <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> salinity on the performance of a small-size brackish water reverse osmosis (RO) desalination test-rig are investigated. In the range of experimental runs, the maximum gain in recovery ratio has been obtained from the <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> pressure increase. The increase of <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> temperature or pressure results in a recovery ratio increase while the increase of <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> salinity or <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> pH leads to a decrease in recovery ratio...|$|R

2500|$|Novelty was {{the first}} {{locomotive}} to be tested. Starting {{on the second day}} of the trials, it began the planned series of runs but very quickly the blower failed and repairs had to be made. The repairs took up all of the next day. However, when Novelty next ran the <b>water</b> <b>feed</b> pipe burst and more repairs had to be made, which seem to have included a seal on the boiler. At the time, the boilers were sealed with a [...] cement-like substance which required days - if not weeks - to set properly. Time would not allow this and the seal quickly failed once the trial runs were restarted.|$|E
