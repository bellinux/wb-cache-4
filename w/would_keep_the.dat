5|$|Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. {{had planned}} to publish The Well of Loneliness in the United States {{at the same time}} as Cape in the United Kingdom. But after Cape brought forward the {{publication}} date, Knopf found itself in the position of publishing a book that had been withdrawn in its home country. They refused, telling Hall that nothing they could do <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> book from being treated as pornography.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} proposal <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> existing station open but with many services calling {{only at a}} new Westbrae Drive station. This proposal was backed in August 2001 by Charlie Gordon, then leader of Glasgow City Council, who said that having a second station in Jordanhill would assist students at the nearby Jordanhill campus of the University of Strathclyde. The proposed new station would have been only roughly 500 yd (460 m) away.|$|E
5|$|Braille {{created his}} own raised-dot system {{by using an}} awl, {{the same kind of}} {{implement}} which had blinded him. In the process of designing his system, he also designed an ergonomic interface for using it, based on Barbier's own slate and stylus tools. By soldering two metal strips across the slate, he created a secure area for the stylus which <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> lines straight and readable.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} Nation of Islam, MalcolmX {{announced}} {{his willingness to}} work with leaders {{of the civil rights}} movement, though he advocated some changes to their policies. He felt that calling the movement a struggle for civil rights <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> issue within the United States, while changing the focus to human rights would make it an international concern. The movement could then bring its complaints before the United Nations, where MalcolmX said the emerging nations of the world would add their support.|$|E
5|$|Also on 10 October 19, {{his wife}} Livilla {{had given birth}} to twin sons, Tiberius Gemellus and Germanicus, whom he named after his adoptive brother. Their birth was celebrated by his father who claimed that never before in the history of Rome had twins been born to a man as high in rank as Drusus, and the event was commemorated on the reverse of coins. Tiberius had hoped that Drusus <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> {{imperial}} family together and entrusted him with the guardianship of Germanicus' sons, Nero and Drusus.|$|E
5|$|Due to its poor performance, Friedman {{believed}} that the Federal Reserve Board should be abolished. Friedman was deeply critical about Federal Reserve policies, even during the so-called 'Volcker shock' that was labelled 'monetarist.' He further {{believed that}} if the money supply was to be centrally controlled (as by the Federal Reserve System) that the preferable {{way to do it}} would be with a mechanical system that <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> quantity of money increasing at a steady rate.|$|E

5|$|In Ancient Rome {{people did}} not eat or drink with the same pottery as that used by someone who was {{affected}}. People of the time would spit on their chest believing that this <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> problem from affected them. According to Apuleius and other ancient physicians, in order detect epilepsy it was common to light a piece of gagates, whose smoke would trigger the seizure. Occasionally a spinning potter's wheel was used, perhaps a reference to photosensitive epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Josh Grier, Wilco's lawyer, {{was able}} to {{negotiate}} a buy-out of the band from Reprise. The band <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> rights to the album if they paid Reprise $50,000. Before Wilco could accept the deal, Reprise called the band and changed their offer to give the band the rights to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot for free. Despite Reprise's efforts to accommodate Wilco's departure, the process marred public relations after {{an article in the}} Chicago Tribune described what had happened.|$|E
5|$|LeMond had to {{keep his}} eye on his {{teammate}} and rival throughout the race. Hinault rode aggressively and repeatedly attacked, and the division created in the La Vie Claire team was unmistakable. LeMond <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> yellow jersey {{to the end of}} the race and win his first Tour, but he felt betrayed by Hinault and the La Vie Claire team leadership. LeMond later stated the 1986 Tour was the most difficult and stressful race of his career.|$|E

5|$|The 24th Infantry {{consistently}} captured Battle Mountain in {{the same}} way. Artillery, mortar, and tank fire raked the crest and air strikes employing napalm blanketed {{the top of the}} peak. Then, the infantry attacked from the hill beneath the east slope of the summit. Supporting mortars would set up a base of fire and <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> heights under barrage until the infantry had arrived at a point just short of the crest. The mortar fire then lifted and the infantry moved rapidly up the last stretch to the top, usually to find it abandoned by the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|While other {{refineries}} <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> 60% of oil {{product that}} became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline {{to fuel the}} refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $.96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.|$|E
5|$|A {{successful}} {{invasion of}} Egypt would have several further advantages for the Byzantine Empire. Egypt {{was a rich}} province, and {{in the days of}} the Roman Empire it had supplied much of the grain for Constantinople before it was lost to the Arabs in the 7th century. The revenues that the Empire could have expected to gain from the conquest of Egypt would have been considerable, even if these would have to be shared with the Crusaders. Furthermore, Manuel may have wanted to encourage Amalric's plans, not only to deflect the ambitions of the Latins away from Antioch, but also to create new opportunities for joint military ventures that <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> King of Jerusalem in his debt, and would also allow the Empire to share in territorial gains.|$|E

5|$|Brigadier Richard N. Gale, {{who would}} later command the 6th Airborne Division, took command of the 1st Parachute Brigade on its {{formation}} in September 1941. A triangular brigade formation with three battalions, Gale decided that rather than dividing the 11th Special Air Service Battalion among the brigade's battalions, he <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> already trained unit together. On 15September it was renamed the 1st Parachute Battalion, which, together with the newly raised 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions, now formed the 1st Parachute Brigade. These battalions were formed from volunteers aged between twenty-two and thirty-two years of age. Only men in infantry units were selected and only ten men from any one unit were allowed to leave. Early in 1942 the brigade was joined by the 4th Parachute Battalion, the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance, and the 1st (Parachute) Squadron, Royal Engineers (RE). The 4th Parachute Battalion left the brigade in July {{to become the first}} battalion in the 2nd Parachute Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{wanted the}} SEC {{to limit the}} amount of {{scholarships}} to about 32 per year, which <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> other schools from offering 45 scholarships, picking the best, and withdrawing scholarships from the rest. A vote was to be taken by the presidents of the colleges on the issue, and Dodd made it clear that Tech would leave the SEC unless the rule was changed. Bear had promised Dodd he would get his president to vote for Dodd's position, which would have changed the rule; when the meeting was held on January 24, 1964, the Alabama president voted against Dodd's position and the 140 Rule was upheld when the presidents split 6-6. Tech's president immediately walked to the podium and announced Tech was withdrawing from the SEC.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} held in 2013, Galv√°n said that Nuevo Laredo, {{aside from the}} violence generated by organized crime, was plagued with extortions, armed robberies, car hijackings, and regular thefts. He recognized that restoring public safety was possible, but reiterated {{that it was a}} difficult and long process for all branches of the government. Among the solutions he proposed was the reconstruction of Nuevo Laredo's social fiber, since he believed that that <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> younger generations and those suffering from poverty away from the lure of organized crime. Galv√°n admitted that the Nuevo Laredo police force was composed entirely of members of the Mexican Armed Forces, the Federal Police, and Tamaulipas state law enforcement and not by municipal police officers, who had all been suspended for investigation and training. However, he said that the military had a role to play, but that he wanted to see civilian forces step up to the job in the future.|$|E

5|$|In early October 2006, Baird's {{department}} reviewed a promised $200 {{million grant}} to the City of Ottawa's light-rail expansion {{project for the}} O-Train. Baird indicated that the government <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> funding {{at least until the}} November election, but added that the Council elected in November would have the final say on the issue. He also leaked details of the city's contact with the German firm Siemens. As a result, the rail program became a focal issue in the 2006 Ottawa mayoral election and Baird's opponents accused him of trying to influence the outcome. Baird and Ottawa Mayor Bob Chiarelli accused one another of lying about details of the project, and Liberal MP Navdeep Bains asked the Federal Ethics Commissioner to investigate Baird's decision to release details of the private contract. Chiarelli was defeated in the election and the light-rail expansion was stopped by the new council.|$|E
5|$|Lyon later {{apologized to}} the House as a whole, {{claiming}} he had not known it was in session when he confronted Griswold, and meant no breach of decorum or disrespect to the body; he also provided a written letter of apology. Not satisfied with the apology, on February 15, 1798, Griswold retaliated by attacking Lyon with a wooden cane, beating him about the head and shoulders in view of other representatives on the House floor. Lyon retreated to a fire pit and defended himself with the tongs until other Congressmen broke up the fight, with several pulling Griswold by his legs {{to get him to}} let go of Lyon. Although the committee appointed to investigate recommended censure of both Lyon and Griswold, the House as a whole rejected the motion. The issue was resolved when both Lyon and Griswold promised the House that they <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> peace and remain on good behavior.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the four}} {{official}} mountain stages, three ended with climbs: stage 14 to Alpe di Pampeago, stage 15 to Passo Fedaia, and stage 19 to Presolana. Stage 20 earned its mountain designation {{by way of}} the Passo di Gavia and the Passo del Mortirolo, respectively the highest point reached and the steepest climb of this year's Giro. Two other stages had summit arrivals, stage 7 to Pescocostanzo and the demanding stage 16 climbing time trial to Plan de Corones, the summit of which the Giro had never before visited. It was hoped that the number of time trials, including one on the race's last day, <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> race hotly contested to the end.|$|E
