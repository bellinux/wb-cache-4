500|$|During James' meeting, he was {{informed}} that a letter bomb had exploded {{in a suburb of}} Bournemouth. In a documentary about the investigation in 2009, James said [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>knock</b> at the door and I was told by one of my officers that an incendiary device had just gone off. The atmosphere of the meeting changed. Clearly there was a risk and the threat was very real". Jean Evans, the woman who opened the letter bomb, was taken to hospital with minor injuries and a bomb disposal team from the British Army was dispatched to the scene. The device had used a party popper to detonate gunpowder inside the envelope. Immediately after the first letter bomb, Dorset Police alerted Royal Mail to look out for similar packages and several were found in a sorting office, having been delayed because insufficient stamps had been placed on them, and defused by the Army. A further seven of the packages were delivered to the homes of Tesco customers. Following the spate of letter bombs, the Army's bomb disposal team was stationed in Bournemouth—something that only usually happens when political party conferences are held in the town—and placed on stand-by.|$|E
