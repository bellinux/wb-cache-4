25|$|The {{second point}} of {{contention}} between freewill and open theists is exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future contingent events. Freewill theists have traditionally affirmed {{what is known as}} simple foreknowledge according to which God, prior to creation, just “sees” or knows all that will ever happen in history. Sanders argues that the simple foreknowledge view has conflicts with types of biblical texts mentioned below and has two philosophical problems. The first problem is the old debate about whether or not divine foreknowledge entails determinism. Open theists argue that exhaustive definite foreknowledge is incompatible with the freewill of creatures. The other problem with simple foreknowledge is that it is useless for God to possess it since once God knows {{what is going to happen}} God cannot change it from happening. Sanders argues that simple foreknowledge cannot explain such things as prophecy, divine guidance, or why God did not prevent particular evils. Instead, open theists affirm “dynamic omniscience” (a term coined by Sanders). God knows all that has happened in the past and all that is happening in the present. God knows those future events that are determined to occur and God knows all that could possibly happen but does not know as definite what creatures with freewill will do. God has anticipatory knowledge (foresight) of what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> do so God is not caught off-guard.|$|E

[...] Jane Grigson wrote of it, [...] "An Omelette and a Glass of Wine is different from any other book by Elizabeth David. Yet in a sense it includes them, holds them together.

2500|$|When {{applied to}} {{real-world}} problems, outcomes {{of success and}} failure {{may or may not be}} outcomes we ordinarily view as good and bad, respectively.

If we used the negative binomial distribution to model the number of goal attempts a sportsman makes before scoring r goals, though, then each unsuccessful attempt would be a [...] "success", and scoring a goal would be [...] "failure".

2500|$|After World War II {{broke out}} in Europe, President Franklin D. Roosevelt {{returned}} Stimson to his post {{at the head of}} the War Department. The choice of Stimson, a conservative Republican, was a calculated effort by the president to win bipartisan support for what was considered an almost inevitable US entrance into the war. Ten days before the Attack on Pearl Harbor, Stimson entered in his diary the following statement: [...] " [...] brought up the event that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be attacked perhaps next Monday, for the Japanese are notorious for making an attack without warning, and the question was what we should do. The question was how we should maneuver them into the position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves." [...] During the war, Stimson oversaw a great expansion of the military including the conscription and training of 13 million soldiers and airmen, and the purchase and transportation of 30% of the nation's industrial output to battlefields [...] He worked closely with his top aides Robert P. Patterson (who succeeded Stimson as Secretary), Robert Lovett (who handled the Air Force), Harvey Bundy and John J. McCloy (Assistant Secretary of War).|$|E
