Kanō's posthumous reputation was therefore assured. Nonetheless, his true legacy was his idealism. As Kanō {{said in a speech}} given in 1934, [...] "Nothing under the sun is greater than education.

500|$|Before the {{establishment}} of the National Action Plan, a variety of people and organizationsincluding First Nations, human trafficking victims, law enforcement, and victim service providerscriticized Canada for failing to have such a plan. Charles Momy, president of the Canadian Police Association, said that despite existing efforts from local law enforcement agencies, Canada lacked and required [...] "a coordinated response to ensure the offenders are prosecuted, and put a stop to this modern day form of slavery." [...] In October 2008, John Fenn of Toronto's Streetlight Support Services expressed his frustration that there was still no national action plan on this subject despite the passing of the corresponding motion the previous year. Fenn said, [...] "Even if <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> muck of the thing if we get started, let's get started." [...] Benjamín Santamaria of Project Desert Roses, another Toronto-based organization, voiced the same complaint.|$|E

2500|$|According to Schopenhauer, {{whenever}} <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> choice, [...] "We assume {{as necessary}} {{that decision was}} preceded by something from which it ensued, and which we call the ground or reason, or more accurately the motive, of the resultant action." [...] Choices are not made freely. Our actions are necessary and determined because [...] "every human being, even every animal, after the motive has appeared, must carry out the action which alone is in accordance with his inborn and immutable character". A definite action inevitably results when a particular motive influences a person's given, unchangeable character.|$|E
2500|$|By 1986, Black Flag's {{members had}} {{grown tired of}} the {{tensions}} of their relentless touring schedule, infighting, and of living in near-poverty. The band had been together almost a decade, and true commercial success and stability had eluded them. The band's erratic artistic changes were a barrier to their retaining an audience – Ginn was so creatively restless that Black Flag's albums were often very dissimilar. At one point, Rollins apparently said, [...] "Why don't <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> record that was like the last one so people won't always be {{trying to catch up}} with what we're doing?" [...] The next album, In My Head, with its powerful bluesy proto-grunge-metal, did seem to finally be a cohesive follow-up to their previous album Loose Nut, but it would be their last.|$|E

2500|$|Yet {{the scope}} of Brougham's {{interests}} and accomplishments is remarkable in itself. After addressing the public in an election he might on returning home complete an article, {{three or four of}} which would be published in a single number of the Edinburgh Review. He has, Hazlitt continues, mastered several languages, [...] "is a capital mathematician", and, [...] "among other means of strengthening and enlarging his views, has visited ... most of the courts, and turned his attention to most of the Constitutions of the continent." [...] Despite Brougham's shortcomings, Hazlitt concludes by offering him as an example of [...] "the versatility and strength of the human mind", showing how, [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> good use of our time", there is [...] "room enough to crowd into" [...] a single life [...] "almost every art and science".|$|E
2500|$|Esch is {{a reserve}} deputy sheriff in his {{hometown}} of Jasper, Alabama, and starred in the reality television documentary entitled Big Law: Deputy Butterbean, which debuted on the Investigation Discovery channel in August 2011. He described the genesis of the show: [...] "They came to me wanting to do a reality documentary on my restaurant and I {{was in the process of}} closing my restaurant down. I said 'If you want something interesting and fun to watch, follow us on our drug busts in the sheriff's department.' They agreed people would be interested in this. [...] "They started following us, filming it and documenting us actually making the busts. You arrest somebody and say 'Look, if you don't want to go to jail you've got to help us bust a bigger guy.' <b>We</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> bigger bust from that. The whole goal is to get people on file and lessen the number of criminals on the streets." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the events in}} Georgia {{demonstrated}} the necessity for greater concessions to the peasants; Stalin declared that an August 1924 uprising in Georgia was sparked by dissatisfaction among the peasants and called the party to conciliate them. He admitted that [...] "what has happened in Georgia may happen throughout Russia, unless <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> complete change in our attitude to the peasantry" [...] and placed {{the responsibility for the}} errors committed on subordinate officials. Vyacheslav Molotov, an influential member of the Politburo, for his part declared: [...] "Georgia provides a startling example of the breach between the Party and the mass of the peasantry in the country." [...] As a result, the Communist Party of Georgia chose, for the time being, to use peaceful persuasion rather than armed coercion to extend their influence over the peasant masses, and to moderate the attempts to enforce collectivization. The extension of the radical land reform and the relative freedom granted peasants reduced hostility to the new regime. Although the last attributes of Georgia's political and economic sovereignty, which both the Mensheviks and the [...] "national Communists" [...] had fought to preserve, had been eliminated, the final victory of the Soviet power in Georgia was accompanied by moderate economic growth, that ensured relative stability in the country. Another important factor in lessening opposition to the Bolsheviks, particularly from the intelligentsia, was the policy of [...] "nativization" [...] pursued by the Soviet government in the 1920s; Georgian art, language, and learning were promoted; the spread of literacy was sponsored and the role of ethnic Georgians in administrative and cultural institutions enhanced.|$|E
