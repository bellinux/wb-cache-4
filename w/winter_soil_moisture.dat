Modelling and observational data broadly support the theory of ASS, however evidence from manipulation experiments supporting this theory is limited. Here, we provide long-term manipulation and observation data supporting the existence of drought induced alternative stable soil moisture states (irreversible soil wetting) in upland Atlantic heath, dominated by Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull. Manipulated repeated moderate summer drought, and intense natural summer drought both lowered resilience resulting in shifts in soil moisture dynamics. The repeated moderate summer drought decreased <b>winter</b> <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> retention by ~ 10 %. However, intense summer drought, superimposed on the experiment, that began in 2003 and peaked in 2005 caused an unexpected erosion of resilience and a shift to an ASS; both for the experimental drought manipulation and control plots, impairing the soil from rewetting in winter. Measurements outside plots, with vegetation removal, showed no evidence of moisture shifts.

30|$|During the winter, low temperatures, plant physiology, and {{phenology}} may {{combine to}} constrain LFM. Although Ashe juniper {{has been shown}} to photosynthesize at moderate to high rates during the winter (Owens 1996, Bendevis et al. 2010), lower temperatures likely reduce evaporative demand, which, along with reduced competition from herbaceous plants, may limit water stress and prevent low LFM even during drought. But why do we not see high LFM during the <b>winter</b> when <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> is abundant? Jolly et al. (2014) found that older leaves of Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon exhibited higher proportional dry mass (kg·kg− 1) and lower proportional water mass (kg·kg− 1) than newer leaves, and that the higher proportional dry mass was related to foliar starch, sugar, and crude fat content. They conclude that, in Pinus contorta, changes to dry matter exert a stronger control on seasonal LFM than changes in leaf water content. Older leaf material may also simply have a reduced capacity to store water because of its higher proportional dry mass. Thus, although our results demonstrate that Ashe juniper LFM is strongly related to <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> availability (KBDI) during the summer, especially when <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> is limited (high KBDI), during the winter Ashe juniper LFM may be related more strongly to physiological processes, metabolites stored in older leaf material, and higher proportional dry mass in older leaf material than to <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> availability.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} new {{approach}} for comparing mid-Holocene climates from 18 PMIP simulations with climate reconstructions of winter and growing season temperatures and the annual water budget inferred from European pollen and lake-level data. A cluster analysis is used to extract patterns of multivariate climate response from the reconstructions; these are then compared to the patterns simulated by models. According to paleodata, summers during mid-Holocene were warmer-than-present in the north, and cooler-than-present in the south, while winters were colder-than-present in the southwest but milder-than-present in the northeast. Whereas warmer summers and colder winters may easily be explained as a direct response to the amplified seasonal cycle of insolation during the mid-Holocene, the other recorded responses are less straightforward to explain. We have identified, from the models that correctly simulate the recorded climate change, two important atmospheric and hydrological processes that can compensate for direct insolation effects. First, a stronger-than-present airflow from southwestern Europe that veers to the north over Eastern Europe, in winter, can consistently explain the reconstructed changes in this season's temperatures and water budget. Second, the increased <b>winter</b> <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> allows a shift of the partitioning of net radiative energy towards latent rather than sensible heat fluxes, thereby decreasing surface temperature during the following summer season. Our approach therefore solves one of the recurring problems in model-data comparisons that arises when a model simulates the correct response but in the wrong location (as a consequence, for instance, of model resolution and topography) ...|$|E

These models include {{a variety of}} different soil moisture parameterizations which influence their simulations of the entire land surface hydrology, including evaporation, soil moisture, and runoff, and their simulations of the energy balance at the surface. Here we compare these parameterizations, and evaluate their simulations of soil moisture by comparing them with actual observations of soil moisture, literally ground truth. We compared model-generated ‘data sets ’ and simulations of soil moisture with observations from 150 stations in the former Soviet Union for 1979 – 1985 and Illinois for 1981 – 1988. The spatial patterns, mean annual cycles, and interannual variations were compared to plant-available soil moisture in the upper 1 m of soil.

40|$|Spatial soil {{moisture}} patterns have been {{measured in the}} 10. 5 ha Tarrawarra catchment in temperate south-eastern Australia on 13 occasions using time domain reflectometry (TDR). Measurements are made on regular grids of between 500 and 2000 points for each occasion. The spatial correlation structure of these {{soil moisture}} patterns is analysed. Sample variograms are {{found to have a}} clear sill and a nugget. Exponential variogram models, including a nugget, fit the sample variograms closely. The geostatistical structure is found to evolve seasonally. High sills (15 - 25 (%v/v) 2) and low correlation lengths (35 - 50 m) are observed uring the wet winter period. During the dry summer period sills are smaller (5 - 15 (%v/v) 2) and correlation lengths are longer (50 - 60 m). This seasonal evolution is explained {{on the basis of the}} importance of lateral redistribution of moisture during different seasons. Both a nugget effect due to measurement error and variability at small scales contribute to the variability at the 10 m scale, which is the smallest scale in most of the data sets. For one occasion four soil moisture patterns containing 514 samples were collected on 10 x 20 m grids. These patterns are offset by 2 m in an easterly and/or a northerly direction. Variograms for these four patterns are similar which indicates that variograms used for the structural analysis are highly reliable.

The seasonal runoff and <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> for the Mesochora catchment in Central Greece were simulated using two hydrological models that were different in structure and time resolution. Variability was investigated via a monthly water balance (MWB) model which has a first-order memory and includes a rough estimation of snowmelt component, and via the coupling of the snow accumulation-ablation (SAA) conceptual model and the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> accounting (SMA) conceptual model of the US National Weather Service (US NWS). The last two models operated at a 6 h and daily time step, respectively. The SMA model predicted greater interannual variability of runoff changes than did the MWB model, for all alternative climates. However, greater runoff increases in winter (by month and season) and greater decreases in summer (by month and season) were predicted by the MWB model. During the spring and autumn months the results were much more complicated. The variability of runoff changes with respect to temperature increase showed that the MWB model is less sensitive to large temperature increase than the SAA-SMA models for all precipitation climates. Whereas the SMA model <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> varied substantially for the alternative climates and a particular month (and season), the MWB model <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> remained unaffected by any climate during <b>winter.</b> The <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> reduction predicted from the MWB model was greater than that predicted from the SMA model in late spring and summer.

40|$|Geomorphic {{processes}} in arid regions are particularly sensitive to climatic variability. In this context, integrated shldies are being conducted {{to understand the}} response of dust emission and deposition to climatic and land-use change in the arid southwestern United States. Several approaches are taken to monitor wind erosion and characterize modem dust - its sources, flux, and composition - to document the potential for desertification under future climatic conditions. Wind erosion is monitored at ecologically sensitive sites, using meteorological stations that measure sand flux within the saltation layer. Dust deposition is also monitored at these and many other sites using different types of dust collectors. In addition, new remote sensing methods detect the location, frequency, magnitude, and duration of large dust-emission events. Remotely sensed images ofvegetation change, combined with those that illustrate high soil reflectivity, complement dust-detection methods to identify areas especially susceptible to wind erosion. Dust trapped in collectors and in snow is characterized for its physical, mineralogic, and chemical properties. Combined with soil and weather data, such characterization sheds light on: (1) the relation between dust storms and synoptic climatic conditions; (2) the importance of Owens (dry) Lake (California) as a dominant source of southwestern U. S. dust. {{for as much as}} 400 km downwind; (3) the impacts of human disturbances in the desert, revealed by signatures of agricultural and construction dust; and (4) the composition and flux of regional background dust composition and flux. Past dust flux is studied from late Quaternary eolian deposits, partly using a new combinaticn of magnetic and chemical methods developed to recognize eoFan dust in soils and surficial deposits over large regions. Such studies have applications to understanding current plant distribution, substrates for biologic soil crust, and paleoenvironmental histories of ecosystems. A wind-erosion model based on wind strength, atmospheric shear stress on the surface, and almospheric stability is being developed. This model will be constrained by remote sensing and ground-based observations and will then be linked with a regional climate model and interactive vegetation package to forecast how various climatic and land-use scenarios interact with critical wind speeds required to move surface materials. will attempt to answer the following questions: How does wind strength vary with natural climate cycles on decadal and cenhlry time scales? To what extent will winds become stronger or weaker under future climate scenarios? How have soil moisture and vegetation changes affected wind erosion in the past, and what can we expect in the future? As an example of possible future conditions, projections of doubled atmospheric CO 2 (above preindustrial levels) for the southwestern U.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 Mountainous {{areas are}} {{challenging}} {{to manage and}} maintain access due to their remoteness and steep topography. Shifting hydrologic regimes from changing climate are projected to intensify these challenges. Of particular concern are the effects and uncertainties from climate change on hillslope stability {{that may lead to}} increased landslides, which adds sediment to streams, elevates flooding, and impacts downstream natural and built resources. This dissertation aimed to improve mapping landslide hazard by integrating process-based and data-driven statistical models. To achieve this, we organized the dissertation into four chapters that begins with motivation and background (Chapter 1) and a climate change vulnerability assessment to access over a large regional area (Chapter 2). Chapter 3 describes a new probabilistic model of shallow landsliding based on a physical model that is coupled with a macro-scale hydrologic model and a soil evolution model explicitly addressing spatial and temporal uncertainty. This physical model is integrated with a statistical model relating observed landslides with local site factors predisposing a hillslope to fail to produce regional-scale landslide hazards from initiation, transportation, and deposition processes (Chapter 4). Concerns about hillslope stability were identified during one of the largest climate change adaptation efforts undertaken on federal lands. This effort included a transportation vulnerability assessment conducted with research scientists and federal land managers of two national parks and two national forests in north-central Washington, USA. During this assessment documented in Chapter 2, one of the top four infrastructure sensitivities recognized was increased damage associated with landslides from projected higher <b>winter</b> <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> caused by changes in seasonal precipitation and snow accumulation. Numerous strategies were identified to increase resistance and resilience of the transportation system to this impact pathway, including information needs such as “site-specific stability analysis based on soil and geologic information” and “identification of areas sensitive to high landslide frequency. ” This dissertation takes on these information priorities by developing regional landslide models and demonstrates the models in one of the four jurisdictions: North Cascades National Park Complex (NOCA), Washington. Chapter 3 of the dissertation describes our development of a hydro-climatological approach to modeling of regional shallow landslide initiation that integrates spatial and temporal dimensions of parameter uncertainty. The physically-based model estimates annual probability of landslide initiation by solving the infinite slope stability equation coupled to steady-state topographic flow routing using a Monte Carlo approach. The uncertainty of soil depth often ignored in landslide hazard modeling is address by a soil development model, and subsurface flow recharge is obtained from the Variable Infiltration Capacity macro-scale hydrologic model. Thus, the model design allows for use of future hydrologic projections to estimate changing landslide probability as climate and landscape evolve. The model is available as a component in Landlab, an open-source, Python-based landscape earth systems modeling environment. It is designed to be easily reproduced and applied in various locations utilizing HydroShare cyberinfrastructure; therefore, it can be implemented in the other three federal jurisdictions and elsewhere. To better understand landslide transport and deposition impacts, we develop empirically-based probability hazard maps from a statistically-derived susceptibility index explained in Chapter 4 of this dissertation. This empirical model integrates the influence of seven site attributes on observed landslides, inventoried by NOCA park personnel, using a frequency ratio approach. The attributes assessed included: elevation, slope, curvature, aspect, land use-land cover, lithology, and topographic wetness index. The physically-based and empirically-based models were then combined to produce an integrated probabilistic map of landslide hazard for initiation, transport, and deposition processes. Thus, these maps identify locations of high and low probability of landslide impacts within the NOCA that can be used by land managers in their design, planning, and maintenance. Improved tools such as these with incorporated uncertainty can be used to reduce system vulnerabilities and lead to adaptations that allow continue use of natural areas with reduced risks...|$|E

However, <b>winter</b> <b>soil</b> carbon dynamics in these areas, which are often characterized by shallow snow cover, are poorly understood due to infrequent sampling at the soil surface. Our objectives were to continuously measure winter CO 2 flux from soils and the overlying snowpack while also monitoring drivers of <b>winter</b> <b>soil</b> respiration in a humid temperate forest. We show that the relative roles of <b>soil</b> temperature and <b>moisture</b> in driving winter CO 2 flux differed within a single soil-to-snow profile. Surface soil temperatures had a strong, positive influence on CO 2 flux from the snowpack, while <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> exerted a negative control on soil CO 2 flux within the soil profile.

In a subalpine meadow on Niwot Ridge, Colorado, soil CO 2 fluxes were quantified with the gradient method through the snowpack in winter 2006 and 2007 and with chamber measurements during summer 2007. The CO 2 fluxes of 0. 71  μmol m− 2  s− 1 in 2006 and 0. 86  μmol m− 2  s− 1 in 2007 are among the highest reported for snow-covered ecosystems in the literature. These fluxes resulted in 156 and 189  g C m− 2 emitted over the winter, ~ 30 % of the annual soil CO 2 efflux at this site. In general, the CO 2 flux increased during the <b>winter</b> as <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> increased. A conceptual model was developed with distinct snow cover zones to describe this as well as the three other reported temporal patterns in CO 2 flux from seasonally snow-covered soils.

To provide insight into how warming and changes in precipitation regimes affect the rate and temperature sensitivity of Rs and rhizosphere respiration (Rr) across the year, we subjected a New England old-field ecosystem to four levels of warming and three levels of precipitation (ambient, drought, and wet treatments). We measured Rs and heterotrophic respiration (Rh) monthly (in areas of the plots with and without plants, respectively) and estimated Rr by calculating the difference in respiration between Rs and Rh. Even in this mesic ecosystem, Rs and Rr responded strongly to the precipitation treatments. Drought reduced Rs and Rr, both annually and during the growing season. Annual cumulative Rs responded nonlinearly to precipitation treatments; both drought and supplemental precipitation suppressed Rs compared to the ambient treatment. Warming increased Rs and Rr in spring and <b>winter</b> when <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> was optimal but decreased these rates in summer when moisture was limiting. Cumulative winter Rr increased by about 200 % in the high warming (approximately 3. 5 degrees C) treatment.

However, these satellite <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> products are not spatially or temporally complete, {{primarily due to}} track changes, radio-frequency interference, dense vegetation, and frozen soil. These deficiencies limit the application of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in land surface process simulation, climatic modeling, and global change research. To fill the gaps and generate spatially and temporally complete <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data, a data assimilation algorithm is proposed in this study. A <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> model is used to simulate <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> over time, and the shuffled complex evolution optimization method, developed at the University of Arizona, is used to estimate the control variables of the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> model from good-quality satellite <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data covering one year, so that the temporal behavior of the modeled <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> reaches the best agreement with the good-quality satellite <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data. <b>Soil</b> <b>moisture</b> time series were then reconstructed by the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> model according to the optimal values of the control variables. To analyze its performance, the data assimilation algorithm was applied to a daily <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> product derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), the Microwave Radiometer Imager (MWRI), and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR 2). Preliminary analysis using <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data simulated by the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Noah model and <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> measurements at a multi-scale <b>Soil</b> <b>Moisture</b> and Temperature Monitoring Network on the central Tibetan Plateau (CTP-SMTMN) was performed to validate this method. The {{results show that the}} data assimilation algorithm can efficiently reconstruct spatially and temporally complete <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> time series. The reconstructed <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data are consistent with the spatial precipitation distribution and have strong positive correlations with the values simulated by the GLDAS Noah model over large areas of the region. Compared to the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> measurements at the medium and large networks, the reconstructed <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data have almost the same accuracy as the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> product derived from AMSR-E/MWRI/AMSR 2 for ascending and descending orbits...|$|R
40|$|In {{the western}} United States, the {{mountain}} snowpack {{is an important}} natural reservoir that extends spring and summer water delivery to downstream users and ecosystems. The importance of winter snow accumulation to upland ecosystems is not as clearly defined. This study investigates the relative contribution of winter precipitation to upland spring and summer <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> storage and availability in a semi-arid mountainous watershed. At this site, coarse soil textures and shallow soil depths limit soil storage capacity to 6 – 16 [*]cm. <b>Winter</b> precipitation exceeds <b>soil</b> storage capacity by 2. 5 times. Accordingly, <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> profiles at most locations in the watershed reach field capacity in early <b>winter.</b> With <b>soil</b> storage near capacity, water released by snowmelt primarily contributes to deep drainage and makes a limited contribution to the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> reservoir. Water that is retained by the soil after the snowpack melts is lost to evapotranspiration {{in as little as}} 10 [*]days. In contrast, spring precipitation extends moist soil conditions by up to 90 [*]days into the warm season, when ecological water demand is highest. These field observations suggest that changes in spring precipitation, not winter snowpack, may have the greater impact on upland ecosystems in this environment. Furthermore, because winter precipitation is in excess compared to the soil storage capacity, <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> availability may be fairly insensitive to climate change-induced transitions from snow to rain...|$|R

The field of remote sensing of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> has expanded greatly and the first dedicated <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> satellite missions (SMOS, SMAP) were launched, and new missions, such as SENTINEL- 1 provide long-term perspectives for land surface monitoring. This special issue aims to summarize the recent advances in <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> estimation from remote sensing, including recent advances in retrieval algorithms, validation, and applications of satellite-based <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> products. Contributions in this special issue exploit the estimation of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> from both microwave remote sensing data and thermal infrared information.

40|$|The {{importance}} of spatial variability of antecedent <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> conditions on runoff response is widely acknowledged in hillslope hydrology. Using a distributed hydrologic model, this paper aims at investigating {{the effects of}} <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> spatial variability on runoff in various field conditions and at finding {{the structure of the}} <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> pattern that approaches the measured <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> pattern in terms of field scale runoff. High spatial resolution <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> was surveyed in ten different field campaigns using a proximal ground penetrating radar (GPR) mounted on a mobile platform. Based on these <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> measurements, seven scenarios of spatial structures of antecedent <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> were used and linked with a field scale distributed hydrological model to simulate field scale runoff. Accounting for spatial variability of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> resulted in general in higher predicted field scale runoff as compared to the case where <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> was kept constant. The ranges of possible hydrographs were delineated by extreme scenarios where <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> was directly and inversely modelled according to the topographic wetness index (TWI). These behaviours could be explained by the sizes and locations of runoff contributing areas, knowing that runoff was generated by infiltration excess over a certain <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> threshold. The most efficient scenario for modelling the within field spatial structure of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> appeared to be when <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> is directly arranged according to the TWI, especially when measured <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> and TWI were correlated. The novelty of this work is to benefit from a large set of high-resolution <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> measurements allowing to model effectively the within field distribution of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> {{and its impact on the}} field scale hydrograph. These observations contributed to the current knowledge of the impact of antecedent <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> spatial variability on field scale runoff...|$|R

Therefore an accurate knowledge of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> might be useful for an improved prediction of convective cells. But still the model uncertainty overshadows the impact of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in realistic cases even in 1  km resolution and therefore convection resolving models. Only drastic <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> changes can exhibit the model uncertainties but the systematic behaviour is still complex and depends strongly {{on the strength of}} <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> change. Here we performed seven experiments with modified <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> using an ensemble approach for each experiment. Only a 50  % <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> enhancement and a complete dried soil impact precipitation patterns considerably in structure, amplitude and location in certain analysis areas. Both, the enhanced and reduced <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> result in a reduced precipitation rate.

40|$|Root-zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> is an {{important}} control over the partition of land surface energy and moisture, and the assimilation of remotely sensed near-surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> {{has been shown to}} improve model profile <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> [1]. To date, efforts to assimilate remotely sensed near-surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> at large scales have focused on <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> derived from the passive microwave Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) and the active Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT; together with its predecessor on the European Remote Sensing satellites (ERS. The assimilation of passive and active microwave <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> observations has not yet been directly compared, and so this study compares the impact of assimilating ASCAT and AMSR-E <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> data, both separately and together. Since the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> retrieval skill from active and passive microwave data is thought to differ according to surface characteristics [2], the impact of each assimilation on the model <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> skill is assessed according to land cover type, by comparison to in situ <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> observations...|$|R
40|$|Satellite-derived <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> {{provides}} more spatially and temporally extensive data than in situ observations. However, satellites can only measure {{water in the}} top few centimeters of the soil. Root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> is more important, particularly in vegetated regions. Therefore estimates of root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> must be inferred from near-surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> retrievals. The accuracy of this inference is contingent {{on the relationship between}} <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> in the near-surface and the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> at greater depths. This study uses cross correlation analysis to quantify the association between near-surface and root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> using in situ data from the United States Great Plains. Our analysis demonstrates that there is generally a strong relationship between near-surface (5 – 10 cm) and root zone (25 – 60 cm) <b>soil</b> <b>moisture.</b> An exponential decay filter is used to estimate root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> using near-surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> derived from the <b>Soil</b> <b>Moisture</b> and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. Root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> derived from SMOS surface retrievals is compared to in situ <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> observations in the United States Great Plains. The SMOS-based root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> had a mean R 2 of 0. 57 and a mean Nash–Sutcliffe score of 0. 61 based on 33 stations in Oklahoma. In Nebraska, the SMOS-based root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> had a mean R 2 of 0. 24 and a mean Nash–Sutcliffe score of 0. 22 based on 22 stations. Although the performance of the exponential filter method varies over space and time, we conclude that it is a useful approach for estimating root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> from SMOS surface retrievals...|$|R

Ground-based point measurement of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> is liable but expensive and impractical for watershed measurement. Remote sensing measurement has provided thriving perspective for spatial and instantaneous measurement of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture.</b> Microwave measurement is effective and successful for surface <b>soil</b> <b>moisture,</b> but {{influenced by the}} vegetation and land roughness, and can’t detect the root zone or below-root zone <b>soil</b> <b>moisture.</b> Vegetation growth is heavily dependent on the water availability in arid and semi-arid areas, and the vegetation index from satellites may respond to the change of <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> and reflect the <b>soil</b> <b>moisture</b> to some degree.
