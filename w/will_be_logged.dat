40|$|Logtype {{distributions}} {{were studied}} {{by a number}} of authors. Galton (1879) introduced log normal distribution and Italian Economist Vilfredo Pareto (1897) introduced Pareto distribution. The Pareto distribution is nothing but the log of truncated exponential distribution and the <b>log</b> normal <b>is</b> itself a logtype distribution. In this paper we have proposed some logtype distributions which belong to a family named 'Family of logtype distributions' (FLD). If X is a continuous random variable such that ln X follows a probability distribution, then the distribution of X <b>will</b> <b>be</b> called <b>log</b> of that distribution. For example, if ln X follows normal distribution then the distribution of X <b>will</b> <b>be</b> lognormal. Similarly, if ln X follows gamma distribution then the distribution of X <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>log</b> gamma and so on. In this article some new logtyped distributions are defined and then provided general formulae for the determination of Laplace transforms, characteristic functions and moments of the distributions belonging to FLD...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Using {{realistic}} hydrodynamical {{simulations of}} the solar surface convection as 3 D, time-dependent, inhomogeneous model atmospheres, the solar photospheric Si abundance has been determined to <b>be</b> <b>log</b> ɛSi = 7. 51 ± 0. 04. This constitutes a difference of 0. 04 dex compared with previous estimates based on the 1 D Holweger-Müller (1974) model, of which half is attributable to the adopted model atmosphere and the remaining part to the improved quantum mechanical broadening treatment. As a consequence, all meteoritic abundances should be adjusted downwards by the same amount. In particular the meteoritic Fe abundance <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>log</b> ɛFe = 7. 46 ± 0. 01, in good agreement with the recently determined photospheric Fe abundance (Asplund et al. 2000 b). The existing uncertainties unfortunately prevent an observational confirmation of the postulated effects of elemental migration of metals in the Sun...|$|R

40|$|Letters Because large old {{trees are}} {{essential}} for forest ecosystem integrity and biodiversity, timber extraction in managed forests should preferentially be concentrated where large old trees are least likely to develop ("Global decline in large old trees," D. B. Lindenmayer et al., Perspectives, 7 December 2012, p. 1305). However, timber extraction and the conservation of large old trees are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Current forest policy and management practices in Flanders, Belgium, aim to convert even-aged stands (areas in which trees {{are all the same}} age) to stands with trees of varying ages in an effort to increase forest ecosystem stability and resilience and to allow trees to grow old. As part of their ecologically sustainable forest management, public forest managers have adopted a large-tree retention approach [see also (1, 2) ]. Tree islands within stands managed for production of high-quality timber are reserved for conservation, and trees within these islands <b>will</b> never <b>be</b> extracted. Large old trees of commercially valuable species that have grown beyond the commercially optimal dimensions <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> <b>logged</b> either. And no tree beyond a threshold diameter [currently set at dbh (diameter at breast height) of more than 102 cm] <b>will</b> ever <b>be</b> <b>logged.</b> The strip-shelterwood system (in which trees are cut in linear strips and surrounding trees are given time to grow old) and the coppice-with-standards system (in which some trees are left to grow while others around them are cut) are two examples of forest management that allows the combination of sustainable forest exploitation and conservation of large old trees. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Bronchiolitis is {{the most}} common reason for {{admission}} of infants to hospital in developed countries. Fluid replacement therapy is required in about 30 % of children admitted with bronchiolitis. There are currently two techniques of fluid replacement therapy that are used with the same frequency-intravenous (IV) or nasogastric (NG). The evidence to determine the optimum route of hydration therapy for infants with bronchiolitis is inadequate. This randomised trial <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the first to provide good quality evidence of whether nasogastric rehydration (NGR) offers benefits over intravenous rehydration (IVR) using the clinically relevant continuous outcome measure of duration of hospital admission. Methods/Design A prospective randomised multi-centre trial in Australia and New Zealand where children between 2 and 12 months of age with bronchiolitis, needing non oral fluid replacement, are randomised to receive either intravenous (IV) or nasogastric (NG) rehydration. 750 patients admitted to participating hospitals <b>will</b> <b>be</b> recruited, and <b>will</b> <b>be</b> followed daily during the admission and by telephone 1 week after discharge. Patients with chronic respiratory, cardiac, or neurological disease; choanal atresia; needing IV fluid resuscitation; needing an IV for other reasons, and those requiring CPAP or ventilation are excluded. The primary endpoint is duration of hospital admission. Secondary outcomes are complications, need for ICU admission, parental satisfaction, and an economic evaluation. Results <b>will</b> <b>be</b> analysed using t-test for continuous data, and chi squared for categorical data. Non parametric data <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>log</b> transformed.
