5|$|June had offseason foot {{surgery in}} February 2008. During the opening {{game of the}} season, Brooks {{suffered}} a hamstring injury and removed himself from {{the game in the}} third quarter, which fueled speculation during the following <b>week</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would miss the first start of his fourteen-year career and that June would start on the weakside. Brooks, however, made his 194th-consecutive start the following week. In a story not published until four weeks later, Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson claims that June attempted to injure him in a November 16 game. June made his first interception of the season and second as a Buccaneer on a Drew Brees pass that was tipped by Ronde Barber in the twelfth game of the season as Tampa earned its fourth consecutive victory to improve its record to 93 on November 30 against the New Orleans Saints. After the Buccaneers lost their final four games to miss the playoffs, the Buccaneers replaced Jon Gruden and Bruce Allen with Raheem Morris and Mark Dominik as head coach and general manager. The team subsequently released five veteran players in a move that was said to be unrelated to the salary cap. June was released by the Buccaneers on February 25, 2009 along with Derrick Brooks, Ike Hilliard, Warrick Dunn and Joey Galloway. The transaction avoided a $2million roster bonus for June.|$|E

2500|$|Around this time, Stone Cold Steve Austin and Shawn Michaels won the WWF Tag Team Championships from Owen Hart and The British Bulldog, but Michaels {{was injured}} and {{could no longer}} compete. Mankind tried to replace him, but Austin said he wanted [...] "nothing {{to do with a}} freak" [...] and {{resigned}} himself to facing Hart and the Bulldog alone the next week. Halfway into the match, however, Foley debuted a new persona known as Dude Love who suddenly appeared and helped Austin take the victory, becoming the new Tag Team Champions. The following week in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Dude teamed with Austin, and Mankind's longtime nemesis, The Undertaker, to face Bret Hart, Owen Hart and Davey Boy Smith, members of villainous anti-American stable, the Hart Foundation, in a United States vs. Canada Flag Match—the first match of its kind broadcast on Raw. The Hart Foundation ultimately won the match due to assistance from another Foundation member, Brian Pillman. Austin and Dude vacated their tag team titles when Austin suffered a (legitimate) serious neck injury at the hands of Owen Hart at SummerSlam. Dude Love feuded with Hunter Hearst Helmsley, as the two competed in a Falls Count Anywhere match. One of Foley's most memorable vignettes aired before the match began, in which Dude Love and Mankind discussed who should wrestle the upcoming match. Eventually, [...] "they" [...] decided that it should be Cactus Jack, and Foley's old character made his WWF debut. The crowd's response to Cactus Jack was positive with many fans chanting [...] "E-C-W" [...] throughout the match. Cactus Jack won the match with a piledriver through a table. Shortly thereafter, ECW's Terry Funk joined the WWF as Chainsaw Charlie. At the 1998 Royal Rumble, he participated under three personas, Cactus Jack, Mankind, and Dude Love. Charlie and Jack defeated the New Age Outlaws at WrestleMania XIV in a Dumpster match to win the tag team titles. The next night, however, Vince McMahon stripped them of the belts and scheduled a rematch in a steel cage, which the Outlaws won with help from their new allies, D-Generation X. On April 6, 1998, Foley turned heel when Cactus Jack explained the fans would not see him anymore because they did not appreciate him and only cared about Stone Cold Steve Austin. Vince McMahon explained to Austin the next <b>week</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would face a [...] "mystery" [...] opponent at [...] That opponent turned out to be Dude Love, who won the match by disqualification, meaning that Austin retained the title. McMahon, displeased with the outcome, required Foley to prove he deserved another shot at Austin's title with a number one contendership match against his former partner, Terry Funk. The match was both the WWF's first ever [...] "Hardcore match" [...] and the first time that Foley wrestled under his own name. Foley won, and after the match, a proud McMahon came out to Dude Love's music and presented Foley with the Dude Love costume. At , Dude Love took on Austin for the title. McMahon designated his subordinates Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson as the timekeeper and ring announcer, and made himself the special referee. The Undertaker, however, came to ringside to ensure McMahon called the match fairly, and with his presence, Dude Love lost the match and was [...] "fired" [...] by McMahon on the June 1st edition of Raw.|$|E
