The characteristics of the daughter nuclei correlated with those of 256103, implying the assignment of the parent to 260105.|$|E

At Barking his high-church leanings were welcomed, and he was invited to preach from time to time at St Alban's Holborn, a central London bastion of Anglo-Catholicism. He was never physically strong, and his relentless work at Barking put a strain on his physique. In 1895 he accepted an offer from Lord Salisbury of a less arduous post, the chaplaincy of St Mary's Hospital, Ilford, which he held until 1900. In 1895 and 1896, Henson was select preacher at Oxford, and from 1897 he served as chaplain to John Festing, Bishop of St Albans. He had time for writing; between 1897 and 1900 he published four books, ranging from purely theological studies to analyses of Church politics. His beliefs had changed from his early high-churchmanship to a broad-church latitudinarianism; his 1899 Cui bono? set out his concerns about the strict ritualists in the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church.|$|E

40|$|The model {{dependence}} and <b>the</b> symmetry <b>energy</b> dependence of <b>the</b> core-crust transition properties for the neutron stars are studied using three different families of systematically varied extended relativistic mean field model. Several forces {{within each of}} the families are so considered that they yield wide variations in the values of <b>the</b> nuclear symmetry <b>energy</b> a_ sym and its slope parameter L at the saturation density. The core-crust transition density is calculated using a method based on random-phase-approximation. The core-crust transition density is strongly correlated, in a model independent manner, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> symmetry <b>energy</b> slope parameter evaluated at the saturation density. The pressure at the transition point dose not show any meaningful correlations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> symmetry <b>energy</b> parameters at <b>the</b> saturation density. At best, pressure at the transition point is correlated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> symmetry <b>energy</b> parameters and their linear combination evaluated at the some sub-saturation density. Yet, such correlations might not be model independent.
