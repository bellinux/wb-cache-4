5|$|At the marabout's zawiya, Eberhardt was {{weakened}} by fever. She returned to Aïn Sefra, and was treated {{at the military}} hospital. She left the hospital against medical advice and asked Ehnni, from whom she had been separated for several months, to join her. Reunited on 20October 1904, they rented a small mud house. The following day, a flash flood struck the area. As soon as the waters subsided, Lyautey launched a search for her. Ehnni was discovered almost immediately, saying that Eberhardt had been swept away by the <b>water.</b> <b>Based</b> on this information, Lyautey and his men searched the surrounding area for several days before deciding to explore {{the ruins of the}} house the couple had stayed in. Her body was crushed under one of the house's supporting beams. The exact circumstances of her death were never discovered. While some biographers have raised suspicions regarding Ehnni, most believe it more likely that Eberhardt, who had always believed she would die young, instead accepted her fate. Mackworth speculated that after initially trying to run from the floodwaters, Eberhardt instead turned back to face them. Blanch argued that due to Eberhardt's history of suicidal tendencies, she probably would have still chosen to stay in the area even if she had known the flood was coming. Lyautey buried Eberhardt in Aïn Sefra and had a marble tombstone, engraved with her adopted name in Arabic and her birth name in French, placed on her grave.|$|E

From the experiments, the following results are mainly attained: (1) The reasons of tool wear in the low cutting speed will be not attributed to chemical interaction between tool and work due to temperature, but the actions of mechanical attrition. (2) The amount of wear in <b>water</b> <b>base</b> cutting fluids is remarkably different from dry or cutting oils, which is attributed to the differences of falling type of the built-up-edge and type of chip flow. (3) The selections of suitable cutting conditions and tool materials for the work materials are the most significant for using <b>water</b> <b>base</b> cutting fluids at the low cutting speed...|$|R

25|$|Another form of {{atmospheric}} diffraction or bending of light occurs when light moves through fine layers of particulate dust trapped {{primarily in the}} middle layers of the troposphere. This effect differs from <b>water</b> <b>based</b> atmospheric diffraction because the dust material is opaque whereas water allows light to pass through it. This {{has the effect of}} tinting the light the color of the dust particles. This tinting can vary from red to yellow depending on geographical location. the other primary difference is that dust based diffraction acts as a magnifier instead of creating a distinct halo. This occurs because the opaque matter does not share the lensing properties of water. The effect is to make an object visibly larger while being more indistinct as the dust distorts the image. This effect varies largely based on the amount and type of dust in the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|The Islamic {{reaction}} towards magic did not condemn {{magic in}} general and distinguished between magic which can heal sickness and possession, and sorcery. Magic is therefore a special gift from God, while the latter is achieved through help of Jinn and devils. Ibn al-Nadim hold, Exorcists gain their power by their obedience to God, while sorcerers please the devils by acts of disobidience and sacrifices and they in return do him a favor. Being pious and strictly follow {{the teachings of the}} Quran can increase the probability to perform magic or miracles. According to Ibn Arabi Al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yusuf al-Shubarbuli was due to his piety able to walk on <b>water.</b> <b>Based</b> on the Quran, regarding islamic legends of Solomon, magic was taught by devils to the humans. Solomon took the writings of the sorcerer away and hid them under his throne. After his death, Iblis, unable to get close to Solomons court, told the people, they will find a treasure under the throne and thus lead them to sorcery. Another account hold, sorcery came with the fallen angels Harut and Marut to mankind.|$|E

25|$|Like ink jet {{material}} depositioning, inkjet etching (IJE) deposits precise {{amounts of}} solvent onto a substrate designed to selectively dissolve {{the substrate material}} and induce a structure or pattern. Inkjet etching of polymer layers in OLED's {{can be used to}} increase the overall out-coupling efficiency. In OLEDs, light produced from the emissive layers of the OLED is partially transmitted out of the device and partially trapped inside the device by total internal reflection (TIR). This trapped light is wave-guided along the interior of the device until it reaches an edge where it is dissipated by either absorption or emission. Inkjet etching can be used to selectively alter the polymeric layers of OLED structures to decrease overall TIR and increase out-coupling efficiency of the OLED. Compared to a non-etched polymer layer, the structured polymer layer in the OLED structure from the IJE process helps to decrease the TIR of the OLED device. IJE solvents are commonly organic instead of <b>water</b> <b>based</b> due to their non-acidic nature and ability to effectively dissolve materials at temperatures under the boiling point of water.|$|E
500|$|The show {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between technology and cultural traditions by personifying traditions as yōkai and mikuras. Ibira thought this up from observing a dramatic drop {{in the number of}} yōkai folk tales as Japan undergoes modernization. Electrical and gas lighting made light of these tales born from fear of darkness. The production team explained yōkai represent the city's culture and functions, and their strengths are inversely proportional to the level of technology of society. As society grows more advanced, the yōkai and the functions of the city they represent weaken. The mikuras [...] symbolize the five elements of Taoism. They turned to technology and became cyborgs to regain the strength to support the city. When a mikura dies, the city suffers a heavy loss of function associated with the element it represents; the water level of Tokyo fell after the death of Suiko the kappa (<b>water</b> <b>based</b> mikura). This theme implies a vibrant city requires a healthy mix of technology and culture.|$|E

[...] In 1998, he checked himself into a mental-health hospital, where {{he was diagnosed with}} bipolar disorder. The diagnosis helped him understand where the two sides of his music were coming from; he felt his disorder [...] "gave birth to the two extremes that are Strapping's City record and Ocean Machine: Biomech." [...] After being discharged from the hospital, Townsend found that [...] "everything just clicked" [...] {{and he was able to}} write his third solo album, Infinity, which he described as [...] "the parent project" [...] of City and Ocean Machine: Biomech, with music influenced by Broadway. Townsend returned to the studio, accompanied by Hoglan, to work on the album, on which Townsend played most of the instruments. Infinity was released in October 1998.
