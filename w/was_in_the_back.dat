25|$|At around 6:20p.m., a {{motorist}} in Orange County notified police {{after seeing}} Simpson {{riding in a}} white Ford Bronco that was being driven by his longtime friend Al Cowlings. The police tracked calls placed from Simpson on his cell phone. At 6:45p.m., police officer Ruth Dixon saw the Bronco head north on Interstate 405. When she caught up to it, Cowlings yelled out that Simpson <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> seat of the vehicle and had {{a gun to his}} own head. The officer backed off, but followed the vehicle at , with up to 20 police cars following him in the chase.|$|E

25|$|The album's {{front cover}} {{is taken from}} {{photographer}} Peter Sutherland's Sightings series. Sutherland has described his photograph as being a chance encounter with a wild fox that momentarily stopped and stared straight into his lens while he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> garden at a friend's wedding party. Lacey acknowledged {{that the decision to}} use Sutherland's fox photograph reflected a running theme of darkness and nature that had subconsciously crept into the album. Additional photographs were provided by Alexa Lambros and Accardi, while Lacey worked with Jason Noto of Morning Breath Inc. on the packaging and layout of the album. Due to an increased popularity in vinyl, the band's label rush released production of the vinyl, leaving the band out of the process - with Lacey later commenting that {{he would have liked to}} have made the release differ from the CD version.|$|E
25|$|Sebastian Bach was {{introduced}} to Skid Row by Dave Feld, {{a friend of the}} band, who saw Bach singing Led Zeppelin covers at rock photographer Mark Weiss wedding. After completing the lineup, the group signed with Richie Sambora's and Bon Jovi's publishing company Underground, unknowingly giving them the lion’s share of the group’s royalties. Skid Row later restored Sambora's share of the royalties, but Bon Jovi kept his, which caused a rift between Bon Jovi and Bach. After negotiating with a number of labels such Geffen, Atlantic, and A, Skid Row settled on Atlantic in 1988. The band entered the Royal Recorders in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin with producer Michael Wagener to record its debut. The studio <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> end of the hotel the band stayed in. Skid Row worked according to a schedule made by Wagener and stayed dry during recording. The recording went smoothly because the band had been performing the songs for a year. The label initially pressed 150,000 copies of the album and booked the band an opening slot on Bon Jovi's 1988–1989 New Jersey Syndicate Tour.|$|E
25|$|Several police {{officers}} who were present during the ambush complained that the attack {{was a result of}} a series of mistakes made by Jalisco State Police. They asked to have their identities protected to avoid retaliation by organized crime or the police. In an interview with the press, they stated that there were logistical and strategic mistakes the day the attack occurred. According to them, the policemen involved in the ambush were only carrying one load of ammunition for their rifles and handguns. They also stated that the police commander was not with his troops when the ambush occurred, and that he ordered {{the first part of the}} convoy to drive further away from the convoy and separate from the rest. He stated that the travel time between the first part of the convoy and his when the police were ambushed was at least 40 minutes. According to the source, a white Suburban passed the convoy and then did zig-zag moves ahead of them, apparently signaling the CJNG that the police convoy was coming up. They explained that when the ambush occurred, their vehicle tires were flattened by the bullets. They were able to escape by driving in reverse at full speed and hiding in a drainage system nearby. Nájera Gutiérrez de Velasco denied the claims that the police commander was not in the ambush. He also stated that the police did not go out on duty with one load of ammunition, and that the police commander <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> part of the convoy, where he was able to call for reinforcements to save a wounded officer.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, Vandross first {{spotted the}} talent of Jimmy Salvemini, who was fifteen at the time, on Star Search. He thought Salvemini had the perfect voice {{for some of}} his songs, and {{contacted}} him. He was managed by his brother, Larry Salvemini. A contract was negotiated with Elektra Records for $250,000 and Vandross agreed to produce the album. He contacted his old friends Cheryl Lynn, Alfa Anderson (Chic), Phoebe Snow and Irene Cara {{to appear on the}} record. After the album was completed, Luther, Jimmy, and Larry decided to celebrate. On January 12, 1986, they were riding in Vandross's 1985 convertible Mercedes-Benz on Laurel Canyon Boulevard, in the north section of Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles. Luther was driving at 48mph in a 35mph zone when his Mercedes veered across the double yellow center line of the two lane street, turned sideways and collided with the front of a 1972 Mercury Marquis that was headed southbound, then swung around and hit a 1979 Cadillac Seville head on. Vandross and Jimmy were rushed to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Larry, who was in the passenger seat, was killed during the collision. Vandross suffered three broken ribs, a broken hip, several bruises and facial cuts. Jimmy, who <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the car, had cuts, bruises and contusions. Vandross faced vehicular manslaughter charges as a result of Larry's death, and his driving license was suspended for a year. There was no evidence Vandross was {{under the influence of alcohol}} or other drugs; he pleaded no contest to reckless driving. At first, the Salvemini family was supportive of Vandross, but later filed a wrongful death suit against him. The case was settled out of court with a payment to the Salvemini family for about $630,000. Jimmy Salvemini's album, Roll It, was released later that year.|$|E
500|$|The D-Day {{scenes were}} shot in Ballinesker Beach, Curracloe Strand, Ballinesker, {{just east of}} Curracloe, County Wexford, Ireland. Hanks {{recalled}} to Roger Ebert that although {{he realized it was}} a movie, the experience still hit him hard, stating, [...] "The first day of shooting the D-Day sequences, I <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the landing craft, and that ramp went down and I saw the first 1-2-3-4 rows of guys just getting blown to bits. In my head, of course, I knew it was special effects, but I still wasn't prepared for how tactile it was." [...] Filming began June 27, 1997, and lasted for two months. Some shooting was done in Normandy, for the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer and Calvados. Other scenes were filmed in England, such as a former British Aerospace factory in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, Thame Park, Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. Production was due to also take place in Seaham, County Durham, but government restrictions disallowed this.|$|E

2500|$|Salt water taffy is {{a variety}} of soft taffy. Despite the name, it does not contain sea water. The legend of how salt water taffy got its name is disputed. The most popular story, {{although}} unconfirmed, concerns a candy-store owner, David Bradley, whose shop was flooded during a major storm in 1883. His entire stock of taffy was soaked with salty Atlantic Ocean water. When a young girl came into his shop {{and asked if he}} had any taffy for sale, he is said to have offered some [...] "salt water taffy". At the time it was a joke, because all his taffy had been soaked with salt water, but the girl was delighted, she bought the candy and proudly walked down to the beach to show her friends. Bradley's mother <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and heard the exchange. She loved the name and so Salt Water Taffy was born.|$|E

2500|$|Irving Nitzberg, who was [...] "imported" [...] by the Brooklyn [...] "Combination" [...] from The Bronx, was put {{on trial}} for the January 9, 1939, murder of Albert Shuman in Brooklyn based on the {{testimony}} of three accomplices, Abe Reles, Albert Tannenbaum and Seymour Magoon. Reles testified that Shuman was killed since he cooperated with the authorities who were conducting an inquiry of Lepke's involvement in labor racketeering. Reles also testified that he helped plan the murder of Shuman with Lepke, who was a fugitive at the time, and Mendy Weiss and that Lepke received approval from Albert Anastasia to use a person who lived outside Brooklyn to help with completing the assignment. Seymour Magoon testified that he stole the car used in the murder on Reles's orders. Albert Tannenbaum testified {{that he was the}} driver that picked up Nitzberg and Shuman under the pretense of performing a robbery. Nitzberg, who <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> seat, shot Shuman twice {{in the back of the}} head when Tannenbaum gave a predetermined signal. Tannenbaum and Nitzberg then exited the murder car to join Reles and another gangster in the getaway car and departed from the crime scene. Nitzberg was convicted of first-degree murder on May 23, 1941, and sentenced to death in the electric chair. However, on December 10, 1941, the conviction was overturned on a 4–3 vote by New York's Court of Appeals, which questioned the use of testimony of non-accomplice witnesses who were promised leniency to support the testimony of Reles, Tannenbaum and Magoon. Nitzberg was tried a second time in 1942 with the now-deceased Reles's testimony read to the jury. Nitzberg was convicted for a second time on March 12, 1942. The conviction was overturned again by the Court of Appeals on a 4–3 vote, but, this time, the court also dismissed the indictment as faulty since the only testimony presented to the Grand Jury was from accomplices without corroboration.|$|E
