5|$|American {{forces in}} Iraq were {{withdrawn}} {{in large numbers}} in 2009 and 2010, {{and the war in}} the region was declared formally over in December 2011. The withdrawal caused an escalation of sectarian insurgency, leading to the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the successor of al-Qaeda in the region. In 2014, Obama announced a restoration of full diplomatic relations <b>with</b> <b>Cuba</b> {{for the first time since}} 1961. The next year, the United States as a member of the P5+1 countries signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement aimed to slow the development of Iran's nuclear program.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{was drawn}} in Pool B for the 2009 tournament, along <b>with</b> <b>Cuba,</b> Mexico and South Africa, {{competing}} at Foro Sol Stadium in Mexico City. After beating Mexico in their opening game, {{they lost their}} next two games to Cuba and Mexico, and were eliminated from the tournament. The Australians set a WBC record against Mexico: 22hits in a single game is {{more than any other}} team has achieved in either tournament.|$|E
5|$|Following President Obama's {{announcement}} that the United States would move towards normalizing relations <b>with</b> <b>Cuba,</b> Pritzker traveled to Cuba. Although Obama's {{change in policy}} did not end the U.S. trade embargo, since ending the embargo required an act of Congress, Pritzker met with Cuban trade ministers and other officials to discuss the changing {{relationship between the two}} countries and {{to lay the groundwork for}} more economic involvement.|$|E

5|$|In {{international}} affairs {{the most dramatic}} event during Douglas-Home's premiership was the assassination of President Kennedy in November 1963. Douglas-Home, clearly moved, broadcast a tribute on television. He had liked and worked well with Kennedy, and did not develop such a satisfactory relationship with Lyndon Johnson. Their governments had a serious disagreement {{on the question of}} British trade <b>with</b> <b>Cuba.</b> Under Douglas-Home the colonies of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland gained independence, though this was as a result of negotiations led by Macleod under the Macmillan government.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Scott Armstrong {{attempted}} to convince Edward Bennett Williams, then {{the owner of}} the Baltimore Orioles, to play a game of Cuban All-Stars against his Orioles. Williams declined, as he had a position on an advisory board in the Reagan Administration, which opposed having any business <b>with</b> <b>Cuba.</b> Armstrong discussed the idea with MLB Commissioner Bart Giamatti and MLB Players Association (MLBPA) chair Donald Fehr. Though Giamatti was interested, he died before he could pursue the idea. Fehr visited Cuba during the 1994-95 MLB strike, but could not secure an antitrust exemption.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban Revolution {{led to the}} {{overthrow}} of Fulgencio Batista, an ally of the United States, in 1959. Fidel Castro severed Cuba's formerly strong ties with the United States. The United States soon instituted a embargo against Cuba, which has made it illegal for United States corporations to enter into business <b>with</b> <b>Cuba.</b> The Baltimore Orioles, who were slated to hold an 1960 exhibition series against the Cincinnati Reds in Havana, moved the games to Miami, Florida.|$|E
50|$|Keïta {{made it to}} {{the bronze}} medal match. He was forced to {{withdraw}} due to injury from the scheduled match <b>with</b> <b>Cuba's</b> Robelis Despaigne allowing Despaigne to win the bronze medal due to walkover.|$|R

50|$|The 1977-78 Cuban National Series was a {{watershed}} {{in that it}} coincided <b>with</b> <b>Cuba's</b> administrative restructuring of 1977, which created fourteen provinces. Pinar del Río's Vegueros won the title, with a slim victory over Havana's Industriales.|$|R
5|$|The U.S. has {{modified}} its stance {{since the}} 1970s, when the State Department and the CIA issued reports exploring {{the potential of}} food embargoes. Congressional Bill H.R. 5426, the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000, removed agricultural export sanctions applied to Libya, Sudan, and North Korea (agricultural trade <b>with</b> <b>Cuba</b> remained under some restrictions) and gave Congress veto power over unilateral presidential actions in this regard.|$|E
5|$|With the {{political}} situation in Spain relatively settled, Irving continued to closely monitor {{the development of the}} new government and the fate of Isabella. His official duties as Spanish Minister also involved negotiating American trade interests <b>with</b> <b>Cuba</b> and following the Spanish parliament's debates over slave trade. He was also pressed into service by the American Minister to the Court of St. James's in London, Louis McLane, to assist in negotiating the Anglo-American disagreement over the Oregon border that newly elected president James K. Polk had vowed to resolve.|$|E
5|$|Canada and the United States {{share the}} world's longest undefended border, co-operate on {{military}} campaigns and exercises, and are each other's largest trading partner. Canada nevertheless has an independent foreign policy, most notably maintaining full relations <b>with</b> <b>Cuba</b> since, and declining to officially {{participate in the}} 2003 invasion of Iraq. Canada also maintains historic ties to the United Kingdom and France and to other former British and French colonies through Canada's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the Francophonie. Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands, owing, in part, to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during World War II.|$|E

5|$|Following the Spanish–American War in 1898, this {{aggressive}} interpretation {{was used}} to create a U.S. economic empire across the Caribbean, such as with the 1903 treaty <b>with</b> <b>Cuba</b> that was heavily tilted in the U.S.' favor. U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt believed that the U.S. should be the main beneficiary of production in Central America. The U.S. enforced this hegemony with armed interventions in Nicaragua (1912–33), and Haiti (1915–34). The U.S. did not need to use its military might in Guatemala, where a series of dictators were willing to accommodate the economic interests of the U.S. in return for its support for their regimes. Guatemala was among the Central American countries of the period known as a banana republic. From 1890 to 1920, control of Guatemala's resources and its economy shifted away from Britain and Germany to the U.S., which became Guatemala's dominant trade partner. The Monroe Doctrine continued to be seen as relevant to Guatemala, and {{was used to}} justify the coup in 1954.|$|E
5|$|The 1935 Jérémie {{hurricane}} was {{a highly}} destructive and catastrophic tropical cyclone that impacted the Greater Antilles and Honduras in October 1935, killing well over 2,000 people. Developing on October 18 over the southwestern Caribbean Sea, the storm proceeded to strike eastern Jamaica and southeastern Cuba while overwhelming southwestern Haiti in a deluge of rain. The hurricane—a Category 1 at its peak—completed an unusual reversal of its path on October 23, heading southwestward toward Central America. Weakened by its interaction <b>with</b> <b>Cuba,</b> the storm soon regained strength and made its final landfall near Cabo Gracias a Dios in Honduras on October 25. The cyclone weakened upon moving inland and dissipated two days later.|$|E
5|$|After winning {{re-election}} by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama {{was sworn}} in {{for a second term}} in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, with his administration filing briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges). Obama advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations <b>with</b> <b>Cuba.</b> Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating. He currently resides in Washington, D.C. His presidential library will be built in Chicago.|$|E

5|$|Mired in {{economic}} problems, Cuba was {{aided by the}} election of socialist and anti-imperialist Hugo Chávez to the Venezuelan Presidency in 1999. Castro and Chávez developed a close friendship, with the former acting as a mentor and father-figure to the latter, and together they built an alliance that had repercussions throughout Latin America. In 2000, they signed an agreement through which Cuba would send 20,000 medics to Venezuela, in return receiving 53,000 barrels of oil per day at preferential rates; in 2004, this trade was stepped up, <b>with</b> <b>Cuba</b> sending 40,000 medics and Venezuela providing 90,000 barrels a day. That same year, Castro initiated Misión Milagro, a joint medical project which aimed to provide free eye operations on 300,000 individuals from each nation. The alliance boosted the Cuban economy, and in May 2005 Castro doubled the minimum wage for 1.6 million workers, raised pensions, and delivered new kitchen appliances to Cuba's poorest residents. Some economic problems remained; in 2004, Castro shut down 118 factories, including steel plants, sugar mills and paper processors to compensate for a critical shortage of fuel.|$|E
5|$|On July 25, 1898, at the {{outbreak}} of the Spanish–American War, Puerto Rico was invaded by the United States when, following a brief armed conflict, the United States Army landed at Guánica. Following the conclusion of the war, Spain was forced to cede Puerto Rico, along <b>with</b> <b>Cuba,</b> the Philippines and Guam, to the United States under the 1898 Treaty of Paris. Puerto Rico began the twentieth century under the military rule of the United States with officials, including the governor, who were appointed by the President of the United States. In 1900, William McKinley signed the Foraker Act as a United States federal law, this established civilian (limited popular) government on Puerto Rico. The new government had a governor and an executive council appointed by the President, a House of Representatives with 35 elected members, a judicial system with a Supreme Court, and a non-voting Resident Commissioner in Congress. The first civilian governor of the island under the Foraker Act was Charles Herbert Allen. This system was still used after the approval of the Jones–Shafroth Act, which altered the structure of government in Puerto Rico, and was in use until 1948.|$|E
25|$|The {{second wave}} of nationalizations {{prompted}} the Eisenhower administration, {{in one of its}} last actions, to sever all diplomatic relations <b>with</b> <b>Cuba,</b> in January 1961.

25|$|Trade {{relations}} also deteriorated {{in equal}} measure. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy broadened the partial trade restrictions imposed {{after the revolution}} by Eisenhower to a ban on all trade <b>with</b> <b>Cuba,</b> except for non-subsidized sale of foods and medicines. A year later travel and financial transactions by U.S. citizens <b>with</b> <b>Cuba</b> was prohibited. The United States embargo against Cuba was to continue in varying forms.|$|E
