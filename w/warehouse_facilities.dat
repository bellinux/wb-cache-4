25|$|As secretary, Cunningham {{oversaw the}} design and {{construction}} of the non-highway capital construction projects in Pennsylvania, {{as well as the}} state's minority and women-owned business contracting program and the Bureau of Commonwealth Media Services. Additionally, he served as the state’s real estate agent and insurance broker, and doubled the state's property insurance coverage while reducing premiums nearly by half, saving more than $4 million annually. He also ran the Governor's management and productivity initiative, which saved the state $500 million in operating costs. Cunningham also led initiatives to sell surplus state property, with the intention of saving taxpayer money, putting the properties back onto tax rolls, and creating community and economic development opportunities. He urged local governments and school districts in Pennsylvania to buy equipment from state contracts, thus realizing financial savings, and also consolidated <b>warehouse</b> <b>facilities</b> in Harrisburg from 17 buildings to four, for an annual saving of $4 million.
