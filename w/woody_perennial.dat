25|$|Vitex rotundifolia, the roundleaf chastetree or beach vitex is {{a species}} of Vitex that is native to seashores {{throughout}} the Pacific. Its range includes continents and islands stretching from India east to Hawaii and from Korea south to Australia. This <b>woody</b> <b>perennial</b> plant typically grows approximately 1 m in height. It has a sprawling growth habit and produces runners that root regularly at nodes. This rooting pattern allows the plant to spread rapidly. At maturity, V. rotundifolia produces blue-purple flowers that are borne in clusters and ultimately yield small brown-black fruits. Its leaves are rounded at the tips with green upper surfaces and silver lower surfaces. While the plant is a seashore obligate, it grows over a wide latitude range. It {{has been used for}} medicinal purposes throughout its native range. More recently, it was imported to the eastern United States where it has become a seashore invasive. Control efforts are presently underway to protect the fragile beach dune ecosystem.|$|E

40|$|A highly {{effective}} and versatile {{technology for the}} isolation of RNAs from grapevines and other <b>woody</b> <b>perennials</b> for use in virus diagnostics Huogen Xiao 1, Won-Sik Kim 2 and Baozhong Meng 1 * Background: Isolation of pure RNA from <b>woody</b> <b>perennials,</b> especially fruit crops such as grapevine rich in complex secondary metabolites, has remained very challenging. Lack of effective RNA isolation technology has resulted in difficulties in viral diagnosis and discovery as well as studies on many biological processes of these highly important woody plants. It is imperative to develop and refine methodologies with which large amounts of pure nucleic acids can be readily isolated from <b>woody</b> <b>perennials.</b> Methods: We compared five commonly used RNA isolation kits in isolating total RNA from twelve species of <b>woody</b> <b>perennials.</b> We made modifications to select RNA isolation systems to simplify and improve their efficiency in RNA isolation. The yield and quality of isolated RNAs were assessed via gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometric measurement. We also performed RT-PCR and RT-qPCR to detect several major viruses from grapevines...|$|R

50|$|Annual and {{perennial}} {{species are}} known to respond to selection in different ways. For instance, annual domesticates tend to experience more severe genetic bottlenecks than perennial species, which, at least in those clonally propagated, {{are more prone to}} continuation of somatic mutations. Cultivated <b>woody</b> <b>perennials</b> are also known for their longer generation time, outcrossing with wild species (introducing new genetic variation), and variety of geographic origin. Some <b>woody</b> <b>perennials</b> (e.g., grapes or fruit trees) also have a secondary source of genetic variation within their rootstock (base to which the above-ground portion, the scion, is grafted).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- An {{overview}} of the various agroforestry systems and practices that exist around the tropics and subtropics indicates that there are various ways in which farmers deliberately incorporate trees and shrubs ou farm production fields. Many of the species so incorporated are legumes. The role of <b>woody</b> <b>perennials</b> in agroforestry systems can be productive and/or protective. The former includes the production of food, fodder, fuelwood, mulch, green manure, wood and various other useful products. The most important protective funetions entail lhe use of <b>woody</b> <b>perennials</b> for soil protection and conservation, and for enhance-ment of soil's productivity ou a sustainable basis, especially ou account of the nitrogen [...] fixing capacity of lhe vast majority of them. Legumes {{are not the only}} group of woody species that have potential role ia agroforestry, but they offer by far the maximum range of choice of woody species for agroforestry iii terms of their economie uses as well as ecological adaptabiity. In addition to the several leguminous woody species that are well known in agroforestry, there are many whose potentiais have hitherto not been fully understood.

50|$|Artificial {{selection}} {{seems to}} have favored the annual habit, {{at least in the}} case of herbaceous species, likely due to fast generation time and therefore a quick response to domestication and improvement efforts. However, <b>woody</b> <b>perennials</b> also exemplify a major group of crops, especially fruit trees and nuts. High yield herbaceous perennial grain or seed crops, however, are virtually nonexistent, despite potential agronomic benefits. Several common herbaceous perennial fruit, herbs, and vegetables exist, however; see perennial plants for a list.|$|R
