40|$|Many {{major river}} deltas {{in the world}} are subsiding and {{consequently}} become increasingly vulnerable to flooding and storm surges, salinization and permanent inundation. For the Mekong Delta, annual subsidence rates up to several centimetres have been reported. Excessive groundwater extraction is suggested as the main driver. As groundwater levels drop, subsidence is induced through aquifer compaction. Over the past 25 years, groundwater exploitation has increased dramatically, transforming the delta from an almost undisturbed hydrogeological state to a situation with increasing aquifer depletion. Yet the exact contribution of groundwater exploitation to subsidence in the Mekong delta has remained unknown. In this study we deployed a delta-wide modelling approach, comprising a 3 D hydrogeological model with an integrated subsidence module. This provides a quantitative spatially-explicit assessment of groundwater extraction-induced subsidence for the entire Mekong delta since the start of widespread overexploitation of the groundwater reserves. We find that subsidence related to groundwater extraction has gradually increased in the past decades with highest sinking rates at present. During the past 25 years, the delta sank on average ~ 18 cm as a consequence of groundwater <b>withdrawal.</b> <b>Current</b> average subsidence rates due to groundwater extraction in our best estimate model amount to 1. 1 cm yr− 1, with areas subsiding over 2. 5 cm yr− 1, outpacing global sea level rise almost by an order of magnitude.

40|$|Historically, {{methadone}} {{has been}} the favoured medication for treating opioid dependency and numerous trials have demonstrated that higher prescribed methadone doses result in reduced illicit drug use (Trafton et al. 2006). However, high-level dosing is also associated with increased risk of serious health problems, including the potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia, torsades de pointes (Pimentel and Mayo 2007). Buprenorphine, also now used {{for the treatment of}} opioid dependence, is less likely to produce these side effects and some cardiologists now request that methadone patients with prolonged QTc be transferred to this agent (Wedam et al. 2007). Owing to the partial agonist and antagonist actions of buprenorphine, transfer is not a straightforward procedure because the differing modes of action can lead to withdrawal symptoms, as buprenorphine displaces methadone at the μ-receptors. To avoid the risk of precipitated <b>withdrawal,</b> <b>current</b> guidelines (Lintzeris et al. 2006) recommend that methadone doses should be tapered to 30 mg/day before patient transfer to buprenorphine. This process may lead to risk of relapse to illicit drug use, which makes extensive dose reductions unachievable (Wallace 2011). Attempts to identify efficient transfer procedures for high-dose methadone patients through the elucidation of clinical symptoms and biochemical measures that indicate when transfer is optimal have produced debate but little evidence as to which measures most reliably predict the optimal time for the first buprenorphine administration. Many patients are now being transferred to buprenorphine and this is most commonly achieved by admitting the patient to hospital, an expensive but effective option. Outpatient transfer has been described and we sought to define appropriate measures to identify when a patient can safely be given a first dose of buprenorphine in an outpatient department (OPD) setting. Despite recommendations to taper methadone, there are conflicting opinions as to whether a correlation between methadone dose and blood serum concentrations exists. Studies by Okruhlica and colleagues (2005) and Wolff and colleagues (1991) support a linear relationship only at doses < 80 mg. Adelson and colleagues (2007) report good correlation in patients receiving methadone doses of 40 – 290 mg and without illicit substance use. With a dose-versus-serum relationship unconfirmed, particularly in high-dose patients, many clinicians distrust methadone serum concentrations and as a result do not use them as a tool to aid their patient management. Many simply use clinical signs to guide their first dosage. We have measured serum concentrations of methadone on stable dose, at transfer dose and at the time of first buprenorphine dose and have measured the COWS score (Wesson and Ling 2003) on patients transferring to buprenorphine and we report our experience in treating 29 patients...|$|E

Thus, objectives were formulated to: (1) describe a general methodology for making optimum water use decisions, and (2) develop a multi-season water allocation model {{that could be used}} for producer planning purposes. ^ A general methodology was developed to assist in farm-level irrigation management decisions under a wide variety of irrigation situations. The management decisions which were conceptually addressed included irrigation system modifications, cropping pattern selection, multi-season water allocations and single season irrigation scheduling. However, only the cropping pattern selection and multi-season water allocation decision were addressed empirically in this study. ^ The cropping pattern model utilized a non-linear optimization methodology to determine the optimal crop acreages and planned annual water allocation. A non-linear optimization technique was selected to enable the direct consideration of non-linear water-yield response functions. ^ The multi-season, field-level water allocation planning model was designed to address the temporal planning decisions associated with a limited multi-year water allocation. The model used a two-state dynamic program model to optimally allocate water between years and to make irrigation system disinvestment decisions. The model also determined the optimal spatial water distribution in a multi-field environment by the use of a second, single-state dynamic programming model. ^ The models were tested using a representative farm case in South Central Nebraska. It was found that the optimum cropping pattern was sensitive to relative crop prices and grain yields. The optimum temporal water distribution was found to be quite sensitive to the water allocation level and the water allocation period, as well as to the cost of irrigation system disinvestment. ^ In total the methodology developed was found to be an effective and efficient approach to analyzing producer irrigation management alternatives under water limiting conditions. ...|$|R

To increase retention a university must know the factors that lead to <b>withdrawal.</b> However, <b>current</b> <b>withdrawal</b> studies focus on aggregate enrollment. At the University of Northern Iowa (UNI), students who have decided to withdraw from classes during the semester complete a form that asks for their reason of withdrawal. The Enrollment Management Department at UNI could use the student responses to identify the causes of concern and create strategies to decrease the number of withdrawals and subsequently increase enrollment. One method of identifying the popular causes of withdrawal is to conduct a multiple decrement analysis. This type of analysis calculates the probability of decrement, or withdrawal from a group, for each reason listed on the exit form. This paper attempted to conduct a multiple decrement analysis to provide probabilities that a student leaves the University due to a particular cause, given her credit classification. Current data does not allow such a multiple decrement analysis, but one would give the Enrollment Management Department the ability to identify areas of concern as well as predictions of dropouts and enrollment. Due to the limited availability of data, this paper was only able to analyze total withdrawals. This does not allow the University to identify significant causes of withdrawal, but it does allow the University to predict total withdrawals and enrollment. The results of this analysis may also assist the Enrollment Management Department with questions such as how many students should be admitted for each student group to reach a desired steady state of enrollment and how many students should be admitted to reach a desired number of undergraduates who complete their degrees in four years.

40|$|Much {{research}} has focused on pathways leading to opiate addiction. Pathways opposing addiction are more difficult to study but may be critical in developing interventions to combat drug dependence and withdrawal. Galanin decreases firing of locus coeruleus neurons, an effect hypothesized to decrease signs of opiate <b>withdrawal.</b> The <b>current</b> study addresses whether galanin affects morphine withdrawal signs by using a galanin agonist, galnon, that crosses the blood–brain barrier, and mice genetically engineered to under- or overexpress galanin peptide.

40|$|Lobster {{muscle fibers}} develop hyperpolarizing {{responses}} when subjected to sufficiently strong hyperpolarizing currents. In contrast to axons of frog, toad, and squid, the muscle fibers produce their responses {{without the need}} for prior depolarization in high external K+. Responses begin at a threshold polarization (50 to 70 mv), the potential reaching 150 to 200 mv hyperpolarization while the current remains constant. The increased polarization develops at first slowly, then becomes rapid. It usually subsides from its peak spontaneously, falling temporarily to a potential less hyperpolarized than at threshold for the response. As long as current is applied there can be oscillatory behavior with sequential rise and subsidence of the polarization, repeating a number of times. <b>Withdrawal</b> of <b>current</b> leads to rapid return of the potential to the resting level and a small, brief depolarization. Associated with the latter, but of longer duration, is an increased conductance whose magnitude and duration increase with the antecedent current. Hyperpolarizing responses of lobster muscle fibers are due to increased membrane resistance caused by hyperpolarizing K inactivation. The oscillatory characteristic of the response is due to a delayed superimposed and prolonged increase in membrane permeability, probably for Na+ and for either K+ or Cl-. The hyperpolarizing responses of other tissues also appear to result from hyperpolarizing K inactivation, on which is superimposed an increased conductance for some other ion or ions...|$|R

50|$|This latter {{analysis}} also differs {{by using}} the Retrenchment Rule to determine {{the value of the}} withdrawal each period. This rule is discussed in Pye (2010) and also Pye (2012). When using the Retrenchment Rule the default withdrawal each period is the prior withdrawal adjusted for inflation as in the earlier studies. There are conditions, however, when this default withdrawal is not applicable. In particular, the initial withdrawal is related to the prior standard of living of the retiree, not just the withdrawal that is reasonably sustainable. Also, the withdrawal for a period is reduced when a test indicates that such retrenchment is necessary. This occurs when the risk of running out of funds before the end of a plan has become too high given the size of the then <b>current</b> <b>withdrawal</b> and the funds that remain.|$|R
