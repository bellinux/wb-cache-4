5|$|After {{watching}} a dinosaur show at an arena in Springfield, Lisa discovers {{one of her}} favorite authors, T. R. Francis, working there in a dinosaur costume. The woman reveals to a shocked Lisa that she is just an actress the book publishing company used for the jacket photos, and that T. R. Francis is a complete fabrication. She further reveals that all popular young-adult book series were never each written by a single author with any inspiration, they are conceived by book publishing executives through market research and the use of multiple ghostwriters, just to make more money. When Homer finds out about this, he decides to get rich by group-writing a fantasy novel. He recruits a team consisting of Bart, Principal Skinner, Patty Bouvier, Moe Szyslak, and Professor Frink, all of whom have personal attributes or experiences that will help with writing the book: Skinner knows what teens like, Patty is a fantasy fiction fan, Moe has already published some children's books, and Frink has a computer. Lisa is shocked to find that they are group-writing a book, as she knows the only reason one <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> is to gain money. To show that what they are doing is wrong, she decides to write a novel on her own with a personal story that readers will connect with.|$|E

[...] "I actually wasn't in [...] that much because they created an entire head. They did a live cast of {{me from the}} shoulders up. They created me and then put the teeth in", stated Fox. [...] "To save my face, they had a photo double that {{would come in and}} do most of the crazy monster makeup - they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> on her. So it would go from me, then in post-production it would somehow go to her and the fake head. They would mix them all together." ...|$|E
500|$|After joining Black Flag in 1981, Rollins {{quit his}} job at Häagen-Dazs, sold his car, and moved to Los Angeles. Upon {{arriving}} in Los Angeles, Rollins got the Black Flag logo tattooed on his left biceps and also {{on the back of}} his neck, chose the stage name of Rollins, a surname he and MacKaye had used as teenagers. Rollins played his first show with Black Flag on August 21, 1981 at Cuckoo's Nest in Costa Mesa, California. Rollins was in a different environment in Los Angeles; the police soon realized he was a member of Black Flag, and he was hassled as a result. Rollins later said: [...] "That really scared me. It freaked me out that an adult <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> [...] My little eyes were opened big time." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{sequences}} where Superman utilizes close-combat fight {{scenes with}} the other Kryptonians {{proved to be a}} major challenge for the filmmakers and the visual effects crew. Desjardin explained, [...] "When we do these fights and these hyper-real things, we don’t want to do the traditional, 'OK I’m a cameraman, I'm shooting a clean plate, I'm going to pan over here to follow the action that’s not really there yet but we'll put the action in later. Because that's us animating the characters to the camera. So we <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> animation with the characters—grappling, punching or flying away—and we would take the real guys up until the point until they were supposed to do that and we'd cut. Then we'd put an environment camera there and take the environment. And then a camera for reference of the actors and get each moment. So then we had a set of high-res stills for the environment and the characters. Then, in post, we take the digi-doubles and animate them according to the speeds we want them to move in our digital environment." ...|$|E
500|$|Seeking {{inspiration}} for Gothel and Rapunzel's [...] "bizarre" [...] relationship, Greno and Howard conducted {{a series of}} interviews with several female Disney employees, asking them to list qualities in their mothers that [...] "they found annoying and cloying or restricting", specifically [...] "the things that their [...] mothers <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> made them feel trapped or made them feel smothered" [...] {{in order to make the}} villain appear more relatable. Gothel's [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] line [...] "Getting kind of chubby" [...] was in fact borrowed from one of these interviews. Gothel embodies [...] "the darker side" [...] of [...] overprotective parents; at the beginning of the film, Gothel and Rapunzel's relationship resembles more-so of [...] "a pure mother-daughter relationship." [...] Elaborating on Gothel's [...] "unique mothering style", Howard explained to Den of Geek that the character [...] "has to convince this smart girl that she is her mother ... whatever her motivations are." [...] Citing Gothel as one of the film's most difficult characters to develop as a result of her complex relationship with Rapunzel, Greno explained to Den of Geek: ...|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} nomination, Garfield {{was ordered to}} report to War Secretary Edwin Stanton in Washington to discuss his {{military}} future. [...] There, Garfield met Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, who befriended him, seeing him as a younger version of himself. The two men agreed politically, and both {{were part of the}} Radical wing of the Republican Party. Once he took his seat in December 1863, Garfield was frustrated that Lincoln seemed reluctant to press the South hard. Many radicals, led in the House by Pennsylvania's Thaddeus Stevens, wanted rebel-owned lands confiscated, but Lincoln threatened to veto any bill that <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> on a widespread basis. Garfield, in debate on the House floor, supported such legislation and, discussing England's Glorious Revolution, hinted that Lincoln might be thrown out of office for resisting the bills. Although Garfield had supported Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, the congressman marveled that it was a [...] "...strange phenomenon in the world's history, when a second-rate Illinois lawyer is the instrument to utter words which shall form an epoch memorable in all future ages." ...|$|E

500|$|Discussing his {{decision}} to join The Young and the Restless, Burton said on The Talk, [...] "I told my manager if I can keep my family there and I can spend time with them {{and come back and}} forth, I <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> in a second. Without hesitation, CBS Daytime made that deal. Really quickly. This is crazy, but I'm just so happy to have {{the best of both worlds}} for my family, because before, I couldn't." [...] Burton was happy with the flexibility of his [...] "short term" [...] contract, [...] "I'll get a lot of long weekends and frequent weeks off so I can get back to Nashville. I don't want to work five days a week like I did at GH", he said during a TV Guide interview. The actor said he had [...] "those first-day-of-school jitters" [...] when he first arrived at the CBS building, but was welcomed by everyone. A week before Burton's debut on the series, a promotional ad aired, teasing his arrival with the slogan Daytime's Hottest Soap Just Got Hotter!. In November 2014, Burton confirmed he had re-signed for another year with the series.|$|E
500|$|Producer {{and writer}} Chip Johannessen {{felt that the}} scene in this episode in which a human hair is {{discovered}} with a message inscribed upon it was a [...] "perfect" [...] moment, in that it [...] "told you everything about this guy ... but {{you had no idea}} what he was or what he was going to do next ... you know what kind of crazy motherfucker <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> but where he is or what he's going to do next, who knows". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Marc Cherry {{was in a}} {{precarious}} financial situation and was having trouble finding a job. He commented, [...] "I was broke, unable to get even an interview for a writing job, and seriously concerned about my future. I had just turned forty and was starting to wonder if I {{was one of those}} deluded writers that wander around Hollywood, convincing themselves they're talented when all the evidence points to the contrary." [...] While watching television coverage of the Andrea Yates trials with his mother, Cherry turned to her and asked, [...] "Can you imagine being so desperate that you <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> to your children?" [...] to which his mother replied, [...] "I've been there." [...] Cherry was intrigued by the idea that a [...] "perfectly sane, rational woman could have the life she wanted, being a wife and mother... and still have moments of insanity;" [...] he began writing the pilot episode soon after. Cherry originally developed the concept as a half-hour comedy. However, after his agent was arrested for embezzlement, Cherry signed with Paradigm Talent Agency, where he was advised to rewrite the script as a soap opera. Cherry completed the first draft of the pilot in April 2002 and pitched the script to CBS, NBC, Fox, HBO, Showtime, and Lifetime, all of which turned it down.|$|E

[...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan.

[...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking.

2500|$|Max has {{a history}} of cheating, which Inside Soap said would make him the most obvious person, but as he has {{recently}} reunited with his former wife Tanya Jessop (Jo Joyner), it would be the worst thing he could do.

[...] They also said he was busy with his own problems, but had form finding Slater (Kat's maiden name) women irresistible (he had an affair with Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) years earlier). They said Kat's fiery personality would appeal to Max and [...] "he loves illicit liaisons with unsuitable partners".
