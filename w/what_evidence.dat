5|$|Little {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} East Saxons during the 8th century, but <b>what</b> <b>evidence</b> there is {{indicates}} that both London and Middlesex, which had been part of the kingdom of Essex, were finally brought under Mercian control during the reign of Æthelbald. Both Æthelbald and Offa granted land in Middlesex and London as they wished; in 767 a charter of Offa's disposed of land in Harrow without a local ruler as witness. It is likely that both London and Middlesex were quickly under Offa's control at the start of his reign. The East Saxon royal house survived the 8th century, so it is probable that the kingdom of Essex retained its native rulers, but under strong Mercian influence, for most or all of the 8th century.|$|E
5|$|At present, it is {{not clear}} <b>what</b> <b>evidence</b> the President may rely on to be {{satisfied}} that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence of a majority of MPs, as the Singapore courts have not yet had to decide the issue. In the Sarawak case of Stephen Kalong Ningkan v. Tun Abang Haji Openg, decided on provisions similar to those in the Singapore Constitution, the court found that the phrase ceased to command the confidence of a majority of the Members of Parliament was a term of art which had to be signified by a formal vote of no confidence taken by the legislature. In contrast, a Sabah court held in Datuk Amir Kahar v. Tun Mohd Said bin Keruak, Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sabah that loss of confidence could be assessed on the basis of evidence other than a legislative vote. This might include, for instance, media reports or letters addressed to the President.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} evidence allows a general reconstruction of how Lindow Man was killed, although some details are debated, {{but it does}} not explain why he was killed. In North West England, there is little evidence for religious or ritual activity in the Iron Age period. <b>What</b> <b>evidence</b> does survive is usually in the form of artefacts recovered from peat bogs. Late Iron Age burials in the region often took the form of a crouched inhumation, sometimes with personal ornaments. Although dated to the mid-1st centuryAD, the type of burial of Lindow Man was more common in the pre-historic period. In {{the latter half of the}} 20thcentury, scholars widely believed that bog bodies demonstrating injuries to the neck or head area were examples of ritual sacrifice. Bog bodies were associated with Germanic and Celtic cultures, specifically relating to head worship.|$|E

25|$|The next emperor, Caracalla, {{in order}} to {{increase}} tax revenue and boost his popularity (at least to the historian Cassius Dio), extended the citizenship to all males throughout the empire, with the exception of slaves. In 213, {{on his way to the}} east to begin his Parthian campaign, Caracalla passed through Dacia. While there, he undertook diplomatic manoeuvrings to disturb the alliances between a number of tribes, in particular the Marcomanni and the Quadi. At Porolissum he had Gaiobomarus, the king of the Quadi, killed under the pretext of conducting peace negotiations. There may have been military conflict with one or more of the Danubian tribes. Although there are inscriptions that indicate that during Caracalla's visit there was some repair or reconstruction work undertaken at Porolissum and that the military unit stationed there, Cohors V Lingonum, erected an equestrian statue of the emperor, certain modern authors, such as Philip Parker and Ion Grumeza, claim that Caracalla continued to extend the Limes Transalutanus as well as add further territory to Dacia by pushing the border around 50 kilometres east of the Olt river, though it is unclear <b>what</b> <b>evidence</b> they are using to support these statements, and the timeframes associated with Caracalla's movements do not support any extensive reorganization in the province. In 218, Caracalla's successor, Macrinus, returned a number of non-Romanized Dacian hostages whom Caracalla had taken, possibly as a result of some unrest caused by the tribes after Caracalla's assassination.|$|E

500|$|Another {{controversy}} {{which may}} have involved Brundage was {{the question of the}} US 4×100 meters relay squad. The expected team included Sam Stoller and Marty Glickman, both Jewish. After Owens won his third gold medal, both men were removed from the relay squad in favor of Owens and fellow black athlete Ralph Metcalfe. The US track coach, Lawson Robertson of the University of Pennsylvania, told Stoller and Glickman that the Germans had upgraded their squad and it was important to have the fastest team possible. In the event, the US team turned in back-to-back world record times in the heats and final to take the gold medal; the Italians were a distant second, edging out the Germans for the silver medal. Neither Stoller nor Glickman (who were the only Jews on the US track team, and the only US athletes in any sport to be on the team in Berlin, and not compete) believed the stated reason for their replacement; Stoller recorded in his diary that he and Glickman had been left out of the relay because the two other participants, Foy Draper and Frank Wykoff, had been coached by one of Robertson's assistants at the University of Southern California. Glickman conceded college favoritism as a possible reason, but thought anti-Semitism more likely, and hardened his position in the years to come: that he and Stoller had been replaced so as not to embarrass Hitler by having him see Jews, as well as blacks, win gold medals for the US track team. He believed Brundage was behind the replacement. Brundage denied any involvement in the decision, which remains controversial. Glickman went on to a lengthy career as a sports broadcaster, and was given the inaugural Douglas MacArthur Award (for lifetime achievement in the field of sports) in 1998, after Stoller's death, by the United States Olympic Committee (successor to the AOC). USOC chairman William Hybl stated that while he had seen no written proof that Brundage was responsible, [...] "I was a prosecutor. I'm used to looking at evidence. The evidence was there"—though, as Large notes, [...] "exactly <b>what</b> <b>evidence,</b> he didn't say." [...] In his report submitted after the Games, Brundage called the controversy [...] "absurd": he noted that Glickman and Stoller had finished fifth and sixth at the Olympic trials at New York's Randall's Island stadium and that the US victory had validated the decision.|$|E
