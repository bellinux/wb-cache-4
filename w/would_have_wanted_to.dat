5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E
25|$|Inside, {{the house}} was more in accord with {{traditional}} stone house, at least in its early years, in having little decoration save the doors and trim, since the Major despite his wealth and fame <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> appear humble and pious. His son's efforts to change this by adding a decorated archway, plastering over the ceilings and using charcoal to marbleize some of the walls suggest he was uncomfortable with the already dated style of the house {{as well as its}} physical limitations to his family. A similar impulse may have been behind Maurice Hasbrouck's additions of distinctly contemporary features to the house later in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|At this feast Ahasuerus gets {{thoroughly}} drunk, {{and at the}} prompting of his courtiers, orders {{his wife}} Vashti to display her beauty before the nobles and populace, wearing only her royal crown (the Rabbis of the Oral Torah understand this to mean naked, something she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do, but due to a skin condition she refuses to do). Her refusal prompts Ahasuerus to have her removed from her post. Ahasuerus then orders all young women to be presented to him, so he can choose a new queen to replace Vashti. One of these is Esther, who was orphaned {{at a young age}} and was being fostered by her first cousin Mordecai. Some rabbinic commentators state that she was actually Mordecai's wife, since the Torah permits an uncle to marry his niece. She finds favor in the king's eyes, and is made his new wife. Esther does not reveal her origins and that she is Jewish.|$|E

25|$|The group {{tracks the}} masked man, who they suspect to be Krei, to an {{abandoned}} Krei Tech laboratory {{on an island}} which had been used for teleportation research until a test pilot was lost in an accident. The masked man attacks, but the group manages to knock off his mask, revealing the man to be Callaghan who had stolen Hiro's microbots to shield himself from the explosion on campus. Hiro realizes that Tadashi died without reason, while Callaghan refuses {{to take responsibility for}} Tadashi's death. This prompts an enraged Hiro to remove Baymax's healthcare chip, leaving only the battle chip, and to order him to kill Callaghan. Honey re-installs the healthcare chip at the last second, preventing Baymax from carrying out the kill order. Callaghan escapes, and Hiro leaves with Baymax, intent on avenging Tadashi. Back home, Hiro tries to remove the healthcare chip again, but Baymax stops him and states that vengeance is not what Tadashi <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>wanted.</b> <b>To</b> calm him down, Baymax shows Hiro videos of Tadashi running numerous tests during Baymax's development as a demonstration of Tadashi's benevolence and legacy. A remorseful Hiro apologizes to his friends, who reassure him they will catch Callaghan the right way.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the history}} of ancient Egypt, animals were highly respected. In no other culture have animals been as {{influential}} in so many aspects of life, nor has any culture depicted animals as often in their artwork or writing. It is estimated that 2 in every 4 or 5 Egyptian hieroglyphs relates to animals. Egyptians believed that animals were crucial to both physical and spiritual survival—vital to physical survival because they were {{a major source of}} food and to spiritual survival based on how well a person treated animals during their life on earth. Some animals were considered to be literal incarnations of the gods, and therefore, it is understandable why Egyptians <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hold such animals in the highest regard, giving them a proper burial through mummification. The Egyptian religion taught of life after death. In order to determine a person’s admittance or denial to the afterlife, the gods would ask a series of judgment questions. One of these crucial questions would be whether they had mistreated any animals during their life on earth. Because of this religious belief, the killing of an animal was considered a serious crime punishable by death. Diodorus Siculus, a Greek historian from the 1st century B.C., witnessed the lynching of a Roman who had accidentally killed a cat during a visit to Egypt. Understandably, this punishment frightened many Egyptians to the point that if one would happen upon a dead animal, they would flee from it as to avoid the accusation of being its killer.|$|E

However, Bửu contradicted Phát, telling journalists the meeting with Johnson had lasted around 90 minutes. One week later, the charges were dropped, because Khánh needed support for his fragile regime and wanted to have a counterweight against Kỳ and Thi. Khánh sentenced Phát and Đức to two months of detention; their subordinates were given even shorter sentences.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of the recording, {{numerous}} artists commented on the process, the 1985 version of the song and co-writer Michael Jackson. R singer Jordin Sparks revealed that, despite having been born after the release of the original, the song had a [...] "huge impact" [...] on her. Celine Dion said that the release of the song would not only benefit the Haitian people, but also serve as a remembrance of [...] "the passion [...] Jackson had for helping those in need". Lionel Richie and Quincy Jones echoed Dion's sentiments and further stated that if the singer were alive, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be just as involved as he had been {{a quarter of a century}} ago.

500|$|The famous {{win against}} José Raúl Capablanca at St. Petersburg in 1914, which Lasker {{needed in order}} to retain any chance of {{catching}} up with Capablanca, is sometimes offered as evidence of his [...] "psychological" [...] approach. Reuben Fine describes Lasker's choice of opening, the Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez, as [...] "innocuous but psychologically potent". However, an analysis of Lasker's use of this variation throughout his career concludes that he had excellent results with it as White against top-class opponents, and sometimes used it in [...] "must-win" [...] situations. Luděk Pachman writes that Lasker's choice presented his opponent with a dilemma: with only a ½point lead, Capablanca <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> play safe; but the Exchange Variation's pawn structure gives White an endgame advantage, and Black must use his [...] aggressively in the middlegame to nullify this. In Kramnik's opinion, Lasker's play in this game demonstrated deep positional understanding, rather than psychology.|$|E

500|$|Other {{conspiracy}} theories {{point to the}} British, the German Abwehr intelligence agency or the Poles themselves, some of whom (especially {{under the command of}} General Anders) had shown animosity toward Sikorski for, at least from their point of view, his policy of [...] "colluding" [...] with Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin, which reached new heights by the Germans' April 1943 discovery of mass graves filled with thousands of Polish prisoners of war murdered by the Soviets at Katyn Forest in 1940. Most notably though, in 1967 the controversial British historical writer David Irving published a book dedicated to this incident, and suggesting British complicity in the incident. Meanwhile, it seems unlikely to some that the Nazis — dedicated adversaries of Sikorski and vice versa — who had secret agents of the Abwehr just across the border in neutral Spain, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> murder Sikorski, as he was worth more to them alive instead of dead.|$|E

Filming at the studio ended on Day 4, and subsequently, the cast and crew relocated to the mountains resort Big Bear, located near Big Bear Lake, California. The forests around the area provided an [...] "ideal backdrop" [...] for the bulk of the episode, which was supposed to take place in Oregon; the setting for both [...] "Requiem" [...] and the series pilot were supposed to take place in the same fictional city, Bellefleur. However, in the pilot, the outdoor scenes had originally been shot on location in Lynn Valley in North Vancouver, British Columbia, in the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve—formerly known as the Seymour Demonstration Forest.
