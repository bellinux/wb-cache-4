It is a debate that is important to resolve. Labor economists need to know more about the potential for labor market events, work environments, compensation schedules, and institutional arrangements to shape workers’ locus of control. While providing no evidence, Miller et al.

If this is true, locus of control might be expected to evolve dynamically throughout individuals’ careers.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe {{inclusion}} of musculoskeletal conditions within multimorbidity research is inconsistent, and <b>working-age</b> <b>populations</b> are largely ignored. We aimed to: (1) estimate multimorbidity prevalence among working-age {{individuals with a}} range of musculoskeletal conditions; and (2) better understand the implications of decisions about the number and range of conditions constituting multimorbidity on the strength of associations between multimorbidity and burden (e. g., health status and health care utilization). Study Design and SettingUsing data from the Australian National Health Survey 2007 – 08, the associations between burden measures and three ways of operationalizing multimorbidity (survey, policy, and research based) within the working-age (18 – 64  years) musculoskeletal population were estimated using multiple logistic regression (age and gender adjusted). ResultsDepending on definition, from 20. 2 % to 75. 4 % of working-age individuals with musculoskeletal conditions have multimorbidity. Irrespective of definition, multimorbidity was associated with increased likelihood of subjective health burden, pain or musculoskeletal medicines use, nonmusculoskeletal specialist and pharmacist (advice only) consultations, and reduced likelihood of not consulting health professionals. A group with intermediate health outcomes was considered multimorbid by some, but not all definitions. With the restrictive policy and research multimorbidity definitions, this intermediate group is included within the reference population (i. e., are considered nonmultimorbid). This worsens the reference group's apparent health status thereby leveling the comparative burden between those with and without multimorbidity. Consequently, dichotomous cut points lead to similar associations with burden measures despite the increasingly restrictive multimorbidity definitions used. ConclusionsAll multimorbidity definitions were associated with burden among the <b>working-age</b> musculoskeletal <b>population.</b> However, dichotomous cut points obscure the gradient of increased burden associated with restrictive definitions...|$|R

As most advanced economies are experiencing a continuous decline in <b>working-age</b> <b>populations</b> (Chaloff and Lemaître 2009), the competition for highly skilled migrant workers has become increasingly intense.

Our analysis distinguishes between migration aspirations and realization rates of college-educated and less educated individuals at the bilateral level. Between one-third and one-half of the slope of the increasing segment is due to the changing skill composition of <b>working-age</b> <b>populations,</b> and another third is due to changing network size.

The resulting increase in the demand for health care and old-age pensions–in the face of a more or less constant tax base–has left governments searching for strategies to cope with the anticipated fiscal pressures stemming from population aging. Whether or not increased immigration might reverse the trend toward population aging and increasing dependency ratios has been hotly debated. In 2001, the United Nations undertook a major study of the 'replacement migration’ question and concluded that it was extremely unlikely that the magnitude of the immigration flow necessary to prevent ageing in most countries could ever be achieved (United Nations (UN) 2001). Since then, most experts have come to agree that immigration alone cannot provide a long-term, permanent solution to the effects of population aging since immigrants will also age and generate their own fiscal pressure (Bermingham 2001; Bijak et al. 2007; Boersch-Supan 2003; Holzmann 2005; Rendall and Ball 2004).|$|R

While there are several issues related to the representativeness of the sample that are discussed at length in Albisinni and Quattrociocchi ([1]), the advantage of using this source is that one can restrict the analysis to the effects of the <b>working‐age</b> foreign <b>population.</b> Not surprisingly, the results are similar to the main specification as the <b>working‐age</b> foreign <b>population</b> is highly correlated with the foreign population in the province and registered in the Municipal Records (MR). It is worth noting that there might be unobserved factors at the province level that are not captured by the main specification of the model. While I control for a set of current and past province characteristics and region‐year fixed effects, I do not include province‐fixed effects in the baseline model because of lack of enough time‐variation in the immigrant population within the provinces between 2006 and 2008. When including province fixed effects, the point‐estimate is smaller than the one obtained in the baseline specification (see column 3), yet relevant. In column 4, I present the results obtained using the immigrant population in the LLM as the main explanatory variable. Not having data on foreign population at the LLM’s level before 2002, and information on the country of origin of immigrants residing in a LLM, I instrument for the foreign population in a given LLM with the province foreign population predicted using the 1995 distribution of immigrants over Italian provinces.
