5|$|Feminist economists {{join the}} UN {{and others in}} {{acknowledging}} care work, {{as a kind of}} work which includes all tasks involving caregiving, as central to economic development and human well-being. Feminist economists study both paid and unpaid care <b>work.</b> <b>They</b> argue that traditional analysis of economics often ignores the value of household unpaid work. Feminist economists have argued that unpaid domestic work is as valuable as paid work, so measures of economic success should include unpaid <b>work.</b> <b>They</b> have shown that women are disproportionately responsible for performing such care work.|$|E

5|$|It is {{a long-standing}} practice, {{as with many}} Jesuit schools around the world, that pupils write A.M.D.G. in the top left hand corner of any piece of <b>work</b> <b>they</b> do.

5|$|A riot {{occurred}} on 4 June 1968, precipitated by the serving of allegedly contaminated food to prisoners the previous evening. Other factors that contributed were the rudimentary and deplorable state of sanitation and personal cleanliness facilities, tougher sentencing introduced with the Parole Act of 1964, and the overcrowding. When the work bell was rung at 1 pm, prisoners rebelled; refusing {{to go back}} to <b>work,</b> <b>they</b> assembled themselves in the exercise yards. The prison superintendent Mr Thorpe negotiated with two deputations of prisoners. As well as better food, they demanded single cells and the dismissal of specific wardens.|$|E

5|$|After {{these initial}} {{observations}} in plants, laboratories searched for this phenomenon in other organisms. Craig C. Mello and Andrew Fire's 1998 Nature paper reported a potent gene silencing effect after injecting double stranded RNA into C. elegans. In investigating {{the regulation of}} muscle protein production, they observed that neither mRNA nor antisense RNA injections {{had an effect on}} protein production, but double-stranded RNA successfully silenced the targeted gene. As a result of this <b>work,</b> <b>they</b> coined the term RNAi. This discovery represented the first identification of the causative agent for the phenomenon. Fire and Mello were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} {{drive to}} beautify the coinage, five {{denominations}} of US coins had received new designs between 1907 and 1909. In 1911, Taft administration officials decided to replace Charles E. Barber's Liberty Head design for the nickel, and commissioned Fraser to do the <b>work.</b> <b>They</b> were impressed by Fraser's designs showing a Native American and an American bison. The designs were approved in 1912, but were delayed several months because of objections from the Hobbs Manufacturing Company, which made mechanisms to detect slugs in nickel-operated machines. The company was not satisfied by changes made in the coin by Fraser, and in February 1913, Treasury Secretary Franklin MacVeagh decided to issue the coins despite the objections.|$|E

5|$|Developments in late nineteenth-century Scottish art are {{associated}} with the Glasgow School, a term that is used for a number of loose groups based around the city. The first and largest group, active from about 1880, were the Glasgow Boys, including James Guthrie (1859–1930), Joseph Crawhall (1861–1913), George Henry (1858–1943) and E. A. Walton (1860–1922). They reacted against the commercialism and sentimentality of earlier artists, particularly the work associated with Royal Academy. They were particularly influenced by London-based US artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler and French painting, incorporated elements of impressionism and realism into their <b>work.</b> <b>They</b> have been credited with rejuvenating Scottish art and with making Glasgow a major cultural centre.|$|E
5|$|During Mao's rule (1949–1976), Chinese {{women were}} needed for their manual labor for farming and for urban industrialization.

The percentage of girls attending school was 96.2% compared to below 20% before the People's Republic (1949). The Chinese government has tried to decrease {{the number of women}} illiterates while promoting adult and vocational schools. The percentage number of illiterates has gone down from 90% in 1949 and 32% from 1993. In the first 30 years of Communist rule women's discrimination was decreasing, but they did not have jobs that had real decision-making power.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, while patriarchal {{marriages are}} one of the great wrongs perpetrated upon women, Wollstonecraft argues that a greater wrong is women's lack of independence. Because they are unable to find respectable, well-paid <b>work,</b> <b>they</b> are reliant upon men. Women such as Jemima are reduced to hard {{physical}} labor, stealing, begging, or prostituting themselves in order to survive; they are demeaned by this work and think meanly of themselves because of it.|$|E

5|$|Historian Luis Alberto Sánchez writes that, after Morris {{closed his}} bar, {{some of his}} {{bartender}}s left to work in other locales.

As other former apprentices of Morris found other <b>work,</b> <b>they</b> also spread the pisco sour recipe. During the 1930s the drink made its way into California, reaching bars {{as far north as}} the city of San Francisco. By at least the late 1960s the cocktail also found its way to New York.|$|E

5|$|In January 1937, the Ordnance Committee {{recommended}} {{development of}} such a weapon; two PaK 36 guns were acquired for study.
