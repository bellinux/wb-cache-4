5|$|The {{question}} of Maria Theresa's marriage was raised {{early in her}} childhood.

These plans were forestalled by his death from smallpox.|$|E
5|$|Death (McKinney) is a grim reaper {{assigned}} to collects souls from Shuckton. He has personal vendetta against Ricky – <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be aborted {{before he was}} born, but who survived the procedure because Death was late to collect his soul. When off duty, he hangs out at the tavern, drinking owl's blood and flirting with voluptuous red-headed women.|$|E
5|$|Parizeau's {{hopes for}} {{international}} recognition, a practical requirement of statehood, rested with France and the Francophonie. He {{believed that if}} Quebec declared independence in these circumstances, President of the French National Assembly Philippe Séguin, a powerful Gaullist power broker who was sympathetic to the sovereignty movement, would pressure President Chirac to recognize the declaration. He counted on a French recognition to spread quickly to the Francophonie and bring the issue to a head. Benoit Bouchard, Canada's ambassador at the time, believed that the plan was irrational as he doubted Séguin, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be a neutral figure in his role, could bring sufficient pressure in the country's semi-presidential system.|$|E

5|$|The Macdonalds {{initially}} {{lived with}} another family, but then resided over a store which Hugh Macdonald ran. Soon after their arrival, John's younger brother James {{died from a}} blow to the head by a servant <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> look after the boys. After Hugh's store failed, the family moved to Hay Bay (south of Napanee, Ontario), west of Kingston, where Hugh unsuccessfully ran another shop. His father, in 1829, was appointed a magistrate for the Midland District. John Macdonald's mother was a lifelong influence on her son, helping him in his difficult first marriage and remaining a force in his life until her 1862 death.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempts}} of the Mortaras {{and their allies}} to identify <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have baptised Edgardo quickly bore fruit. After their present servant Anna Facchini adamantly denied any involvement, they considered former employees and soon earmarked Morisi as a possible candidate. In late July 1858 the Mortara home was visited by Ginerva Scagliarini, a friend of Morisi's who had once worked for Marianna's brother-in-law Cesare De Angelis. Marianna's brother Angelo Padovani tested Scagliarini by saying falsely {{that he had heard}} it was Morisi who had baptised Edgardo. The ruse worked—Scagliarini said that she had been told the same thing by Morisi's sister Monica.|$|E
5|$|At Massive Dynamic, Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes to {{the team}} that Observers are time travelers, {{as they have been}} {{documented}} during several major events in history. They write in an incomprehensible language, and the number of Observer sightings has increased over the past few months, leaving the team wondering why. Meanwhile, August visits the other Observers, who are not happy that he saved a girl <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> die in the plane crash. To correct his mistake, they send Donald Long (Paul Rae), an assassin affiliated with the Observers to correct August's actions. In an attempt to save Christine, August sends a secret message to Walter. During the meeting, August reveals Christine will die because she is not important; Walter tells August that he has to make her important.|$|E

5|$|Doggett and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{return to}} Squamash, {{and the two}} ask the sheriff about the murder of an {{unidentified}} transient. Doggett believes that the transient was murdered by Mulder. Doggett and Skinner travel to the cemetery and discover that the grave dug up by the backhoe earlier {{is that of the}} transient. The two find the casket empty, but Doggett notices that the transient tunneled out of his own coffin. The sheriff arrives with the creature—revealed to be a soul eater, a creature that subsists off human disease—at the Hangemuhl home, where the symbol in blood is on the door again. The hideous creature opens its jaws wide and bites Hangemuhl. Doggett suggests to Skinner that Mulder shot someone to protect Hangemuhl from the man <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be in that grave. Meanwhile, deep underground, the creature vomits {{what appears to be the}} visceral remains of Marie into a person-shaped mold in the soil.|$|E
5|$|In 1571, Cecil and Walsingham {{uncovered}} the Ridolfi Plot, {{which was a}} plan to replace Elizabeth with Mary {{with the help of}} Spanish troops and the Duke of Norfolk. Norfolk was executed, and the English Parliament introduced a bill barring Mary from the throne, to which Elizabeth refused to give royal assent. To discredit Mary, the casket letters were published in London. Plots centred on Mary continued. Pope Gregory XIII endorsed one plan {{in the latter half of}} the 1570s to marry her to the governor of the Low Countries and half-brother of Philip II of Spain, Don John of Austria, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> organise the invasion of England from the Spanish Netherlands. After the Throckmorton Plot of 1583, Walsingham introduced the Bond of Association and the Act for the Queen's Safety, which sanctioned the killing of anyone who plotted against Elizabeth and aimed to prevent a putative successor from profiting from her murder. In February 1585, William Parry was convicted of plotting to assassinate Elizabeth, without Mary's knowledge, though her agent Thomas Morgan was implicated. In April, Mary was placed in the stricter custody of Sir Amias Paulet, and at Christmas she was moved to a moated manor house at Chartley.|$|E
5|$|Six of the 12 {{films have}} been adapted into novels—Friday the 13th 1 – 3, Jason Lives, Jason X, and Freddy vs. Jason—with Friday the 13th Part 3 being adapted twice. The first novel was Michael Avallone's 1982 {{adaptation}} of Friday the 13th Part 3; Avallone had previously adapted Beneath the Planet of the Apes and Shock Treatment. The author {{chose to use}} an alternate ending, one that was filmed for Part 3 but never used, as the conclusion for his adaptation. In the alternate ending, Chris, {{who is in a}} canoe, hears her boyfriend Rick's voice and immediately runs back to the house. When she opens the door, Jason is standing there with a machete and decapitates her. The next book was not published until 1986, when Simon Hawke adapted Jason Lives. Hawke would also adapt the first three films into novels, and his adaptation of the original Friday the 13th was published in 1987, with novelizations of Part 2 and 3 both being published in 1988. Hawke's first adaptation, Jason Lives, introduced the character of Elias Voorhees, Jason's father, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> appear in the film before being cut by the studio. The book explains how Elias has Jason's body buried, instead of the planned cremation, after his death in The Final Chapter.|$|E

25|$|Because the British edition {{lacked the}} Epilogue, which {{accounts}} for Ishmael's survival, {{it seemed that the}} story was told by someone <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have perished. Many reviewers in British magazines recognized a violation of the rules of fiction and criticized the author for the serious flaw. Other reviewers, however, found the book too fascinating to dismiss for these reasons. Some of the scornful British reviews were either reprinted or quoted in American periodicals, wrong-footing the American readers because they had access to the Epilogue. About 3,200 copies were sold during the author's life.|$|E
