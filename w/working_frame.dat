Sinking upon a chair herself, she sat long looking at the convulsed and <b>working</b> <b>frame</b> of Sigismund in silent horror. It {{appeared}} to her, that Providence, for some great but secret purpose, was disposed to visit them all with more than a double amount of its anger, and that a family which had been accursed for so many generations, was about to fill the measure of its woes. Still her own true heart did not change. On the contrary, its long-cherished and secret purpose rather grew stronger under this sudden appeal to its generous and noble properties, and never was the resolution to devote herself, her life, and all her envied hopes, to the solace of his unmerited wrongs, so strong and riveted as at that trying moment.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this article, {{we propose}} a dynamic {{model of the}} {{three-dimensional}} eel swim. This model is analytical and suited to the on-line control of eel-like robots. The proposed solution {{is based on the}} Large Amplitude Elongated Body Theory of Lighthill and a <b>working</b> <b>frame</b> recently proposed in [1] for the dynamic modeling of hyper-redundant robots. This <b>working</b> <b>frame</b> was named "macro-continuous" since at this macroscopic scale, the robot (or the animal) is considered as a Cosserat beam internally (and continuously) actuated. This article proposes new results in two directions. Firstly, it achieves an extension of the Lighthill theory to the case of a self propelled body swimming in three dimensions, while including a model of the internal control torque. Secondly, this generalization of the Lighthill model is achieved due to a new set of equations which is also derived in this article. These equations generalize the Poincaré equations of a Cosserat beam to the case of an open system containing a fluid stratified around the slender beam...|$|E

Furthermore, we have reduced the computational time of the 3 D-DWT stage, but the time of the coding stage has not been considered at this time. So, in order to improve the global coding time, we consider implementing a two-phase pipeline strategy considering both the 3 D-DWT and the coding stage.

40|$|ABSTRACT In software-oriented multithread-ing {{execution}} model, the compiler {{identifies the}} re-mote accesses and performs fast context switches t,o hide remote =cess latency. In TAM model of execu-tion, threads access the local memory through a data structure called “frame”. This paper introduces a cache memory for frame structure and applies two techniques {{to reduce the}} cache miss ratio. One is a frame prefetching, {{which is based on}} the frame scheduling information, and the other is a changing frame execution sequences by the <b>working</b> <b>frame</b> set concept. Multithreading simulation is performed us-ing benchmark programs and causes of cache misses are classified and analyzed. This paper shows the promising result that the frame prefetching based on scheduling information is very effective to reduce the cache miss ratio. But the effect of reordering the sequence of the frame execution is not so big than the prefetching. ...|$|E

Embedded systems came into limelight with the birth of microcontrollers and have invaded and embedded themselves into all fields of our lives and this ubiquity is increasing in our daily lives. Despite this, the level of awareness of embedded system is low, hence this paper is written. During the survey of embedded systems evolution the point that they perform dedicated functions was brought to the fore. Most embedded systems are encapsulated within the main <b>working</b> <b>frame</b> of the device being controlled. The widespread and diverse natures of the system as seen in the numerous applications confirm the revolution of this ubiquitous system.

40|$|In this paper, an {{approach}} to improve the spatial resolution of color video is presented. Such high resolution images are desired, for example, in video printing. Previous work {{has shown that the}} most important step in achieving high quality results is the accuracy of the motion field. It is well known that motion estimation is an ill-posed problem. However, in processing color video, additional information contained in the color channels may be used to improve the accuracy of the motion field over the motion field obtained with the use of only one channel. In turn, this improvement in the motion field will be shown through several experimental results to significantly improve the estimation of a high resolution image sequence from a corresponding observed low resolution sequence. 1 Introduction Improved resolution of a still image from a monochrome image sequence has been demonstrated in [8, 9].

40|$|International audienceSatellite {{positioning}} is a {{key technology}} for autonomous navigation in outdoors environments. When using standalone computation with mono-frequency receivers, positioning errors are not {{in accordance with the}} required performance. Nevertheless, since errors are strongly time-correlated, a GPS fix is quite informative if a shaping model of the positioning errors is carefully handled and made possible by exteroceptive sensors. When driving in a road with a camera detecting lane markings, the lateral error is directly observable by using a lane marking map. It can be well modeled by mixing auto-regressive and random constant models. An algebraic observability study is conducted to prove that this modeling is completely observable in a road frame. A new road invariant Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is then presented to conserve the observability of every component of the state vector for any road whatever its orientation. The filter manages road changes by using bijective transformations that are detailed. Real experimental results indicate that the performance of the estimation process is significantly improved compared to a classic EKF that is implemented in a fixed <b>working</b> <b>frame</b> with a less informative error modeling...|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} awareness {{on the role}} played by circadian rhythm abnormalities in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). The characterization of the circadian dysfunction parallels the mounting evidence that the hallmarks of neurodegeneration also affect the retina and frequently lead to loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and to different degrees of optic neuropathy. In the RGC population, there is the subgroup of cells intrinsically photosensitive and expressing the photopigment melanopsin [melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) ], which are now well known to drive the entrainment of circadian rhythms to the light–dark cycles. Thus, the correlation between the pathological changes affecting the retina and mRGCs with the circadian imbalance in these neurodegenerative diseases is now clearly emerging, pointing to the possibility that these patients might be amenable to and benefit from light therapy. Currently, this connection is better established for AD and PD, but the same scenario may apply to other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington’s disease. This review highlights similarities and differences in the retinal/circadian rhythm axis in these neurodegenerative diseases posing a <b>working</b> <b>frame</b> for future studies...|$|E
40|$|The main {{result of}} this paper is a {{coefficient}} formula that sharpens and generalizes Alon and Tarsi’s Combinatorial Nullstellensatz. On its own, it is a result about polynomials, providing some information about the polynomial map P |X 1 ×···×Xn when only incomplete information about the polynomial P (X 1, [...] ., Xn) is given. In a very general <b>working</b> <b>frame,</b> the grid points x ∈ X 1 × · · · × Xn which do not vanish under an algebraic solution – a certain describing polynomial P (X 1, [...] ., Xn) – correspond to the explicit solutions of a problem. As a consequence of the coefficient formula, we prove that the existence of an algebraic solution is equivalent to the existence of a nontrivial solution to a problem. By a problem, we mean everything that “owns ” both, a set S, which may be called the set of solutions; and a subset Striv ⊆ S, the set of trivial solutions. We give several examples of how to find algebraic solutions, and how to apply our coefficient formula. These examples are mainly from graph theory and combinatorial number theory, but we also prove several versions of Chevalley and Warning’s Theorem, including a generalization of Olson’s Theorem, as examples and useful corollaries. We obtain a permanent formula by applying our coefficient formula to the matrix polynomial, which is a generalization of the graph polynomial. This formula is an integrative generalization and sharpening of: 1. Ryser’s permanent formula. 2. Alon’s Permanent Lemma. 3. Alon and Tarsi’s Theorem about orientations and colorings of graphs. Furthermore, in combination with the Vigneron-Ellingham-Goddyn property of planar n-regular graphs, the formula contains as very special cases: 4. Scheim’s formula for the number of edge n-colorings of such graphs. 5.

40|$|Thesis (MCom.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2005. This study {{seeks to}} engage in a {{discourse}} on the praxis of strategy and more specifically, marketing strategy. Within the confines of this study, an exploratory analysis is done looking at the difference between the theory and praxis of marketing, as motivated by concerns about the current emphasis and methodology in which marketing theory is taught and applied in practice. The findings of the study showed that the majority of practitioners working in senior strategic marketing positions had not received specific marketing training. This suggests that marketing, in the current degree structure, is not reaching its desired target market. Although there was an acknowledgement of the value of theory as a frame for thinking, the majority of practitioners spoke to the need for compromise between the ideal and the 'practical-implementable'; the need to augment the strategic theory with practical, tactical skills and a dualistic approach to the dissemination of the theory. This approach should work firstly, to master the theory and/or theoretical model as designed and written and secondly, to enable creative use of the model in different contexts. The practitioners further pointed to the need for marketing and accountancy as core subjects in the Bachelor of Commerce degree, explaining that both subjects provide a meaningful platform for understanding how business works. Practitioners expressed a lack of support for marketing in their organizations using ongoing internal education and feedback to massage a fundamental overhaul of current perceptions relating to the ineffectiveness of marketing. Practitioners suggested a lack of full utilization of marketing capacity explaining that their primary responsibility related to the promotion function only. Finally, they discussed the need for tools to assist in the management of marketing in a complex environment. In terms of practitioner responses to theoretical constructs, it was suggested that strategy developed for the organisation and for marketing specifically did not follow a linear, traditional format, but was more flexible and adaptive working inclusively and consultatively to develop core objectives and issues used as a <b>working</b> <b>frame.</b> In terms of the measurement of implementation success, most of them alluded to the use of feedback as a monitoring mechanism, talking further about the benefit of communication, internal marketing, teams, education and learning as drivers of successful implementation...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn most of {{classical}} fusion problems modeled from belief functions, {{the frame of}} discernment is considered as static.
