They evaluated officials on criteria of competence, honesty, obedience to the imperial court, adherence to the law, their treatment of convicts, and any signs of extortion, nepotism, or factionalism. These reports <b>were</b> <b>submitted</b> to the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk and Imperial Counselor during Western Han, but by Eastern Han these reports <b>were</b> <b>submitted</b> to each of the Three Excellencies. The reports were then used to promote, demote, dismiss, or prosecute local officials.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} decrees that were {{probably}} fraudulent <b>were</b> <b>submitted</b> and duly printed in local newspapers, {{and it is}} believed that in at least a few cases, newspaper editors themselves drafted fictitious edicts to suit their own agendas.

Two finalist designs were presented to the Provo City Council in September, featuring a stylized mountain against a white or blue field. On January 6, 2015, the Provo City Council unanimously selected the city's new flag, a new design that incorporated the city's new logo (adopted in 2012).|$|E
5|$|After Israel {{captured}} East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967, {{a number}} of plans <b>were</b> <b>submitted</b> {{for the design of}} a new building. After years of deliberation and indecision, a commemorative arch was erected instead at the site in 1977, itself becoming a prominent landmark of the Jewish Quarter. The plan to rebuild the synagogue in its 19th-century style received approval by the Israeli Government in 2000, and the newly rebuilt synagogue was dedicated on March 15, 2010.|$|E
5|$|During {{the long}} history of the British science fiction {{television}} programme Doctor Who, a number of stories were proposed but, for a variety of reasons, never fully produced. Below is a list of unmade serials which <b>were</b> <b>submitted</b> by recognised professional writers and the BBC had intended to produce, but {{for one reason or another}} were not made. Many have since been the subject of a feature in Doctor Who Magazine, or other professional periodicals or books devoted to the television show.|$|E

5|$|During the {{petition}} drive, national organizations {{on both the}} gun rights and gun control sides became involved by providing mailings and donations. Once {{the petition}}s <b>were</b> <b>submitted,</b> Morse and Giron challenged the effort in court, but were denied the injunction that they had requested from the court. A further court hearing resulted in the election being conducted in-person rather than by mail, which also led to Giron complaining of voter suppression.|$|E
5|$|Featuring {{only four}} engines, the design also {{required}} new engine designs with greatly increased power and better fuel economy. In May 1964, airframe proposals arrived from Boeing, Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, and Martin Marietta; engine proposals <b>were</b> <b>submitted</b> by General Electric, Curtiss-Wright, and Pratt & Whitney. After a downselect, Boeing, Douglas, and Lockheed were given additional study contracts for the airframe, along with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for the engines.|$|E
5|$|Further {{proposals}} {{based on}} the delta wing resulted in {{two versions of the}} design known as C104: the single engine C104/4 and twin-engined C104/2. The designs were otherwise similar, using a low-mounted delta-wing; the primary advantages of the C104/2 were a larger overall size which offered a much larger internal weapons bay, at the time a cutting-edge feature in a fighter, and gave it twin-engine reliability. The proposals <b>were</b> <b>submitted</b> to the RCAF in June 1952.|$|E

The first and second drafts of the pilot script, written by Benioff and Weiss, <b>were</b> <b>submitted</b> in August 2007, and June 2008, respectively. While HBO found both drafts to their liking, a pilot was not ordered until November 2008, with the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike possibly delaying the process.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, WPD {{applied to}} Cardiff County Council for {{planning}} permission for a miniroundabout on Lisvane Road and listed building consent {{to alter the}} structure of the reservoir.

The appeal was heard during the Summer of 2011.|$|E
5|$|New {{legislation}} {{stopped the}} TMB from investigating anonymous complaints concerning physicians {{as of the}} fall of 2011. The change was seen as a victory by physicians rights groups, who said that it would promote accountability in the investigations of physicians. Other groups worried that the new law would discourage the reporting of legitimate complaints against physicians. The board received 6,849 complaints in 2010; four percent of the complaints <b>were</b> <b>submitted</b> anonymously.|$|E

5|$|Rowling {{finished}} writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in January 2007. Before its release, Bloomsbury reportedly spent £10million to {{keep the}} book's contents safe before its release date. American publisher Arthur Levine refused any copies of the novel {{to be released in}} advance for press review, although two reviews <b>were</b> <b>submitted</b> early. Shortly before release, photos of all 759 pages of the U.S. edition were leaked and transcribed, leading Scholastic to look for the source that had leaked it.|$|E
5|$|Several design {{proposals}} <b>were</b> <b>submitted,</b> all {{calling for}} heavy main guns, between 30.5cm(12in) and 34.3cm(13.5in) calibers. However, financial limitations dictated that smaller, less expensive weaponry {{would be used}} instead. The final design therefore used the same 28cm(11in) double turret introduced {{for the last two}} s— hydraulic elevated Drh LC/1907 instead of electrical elevated Drh LC/1906. In compensation, the design was given a relatively heavy secondary armament.|$|E

Both sides of the coin were designed by Frank Gasparro, the Chief Engraver of the United States Mint.|$|E
5|$|Three bids <b>were</b> <b>submitted</b> by the {{deadline}} of 1 April 1997, and {{the contract with}} Talbot, which had just been bought by Bombardier, was finalized on 27 November 1997. By this time the order had been extended to eleven units, which are variations of the Talbot Talent. Before delivery a further four units were purchased, so the trains could operate all the services on the Nordland Line, replacing most of the locomotive-hauled day trains. Only the night train would remain locomotive-hauled.|$|E
5|$|A {{committee}} {{was set up}} in October 1838 to investigate the viability of a causeway at the site. On 16 February 1839 plans which had been prepared by Roe <b>were</b> <b>submitted</b> by the committee's chairman to Henry Trigg, the Superintendent of Public Works. Trigg called for other plans and prepared estimates. At a meeting of the committee on 27 February 1839, Trigg submitted a plan designed by Major Frederick Irwin, which was estimated to cost £2,300. The committee cut the estimated figure to £1,800, and waited for Governor Hutt to specify how much could be funded by the government.|$|E
