5|$|A Folding@home {{participant}} installs {{a client}} program {{on their personal}} computer. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics. The computer clients run continuously in the background at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected. The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings. The client connects to a Folding@home server and retrieves a <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to uniprocessor and multi-core processor systems, and graphics processing units. The diversity and power of each hardware architecture provides Folding@home {{with the ability to}} efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.|$|E
5|$|Similarly {{to other}} {{distributed}} computing projects, Folding@home quantitatively assesses user computing {{contributions to the}} project through a credit system. All units from a given protein project have uniform base credit, which is determined by benchmarking one or more work units from that project on an official reference machine before the project is released. Each user receives these base points for completing every <b>work</b> <b>unit,</b> though {{through the use of}} a passkey they can receive added bonus points for reliably and rapidly completing units which are more demanding computationally or have a greater scientific priority. Users may also receive credit for their work by clients on multiple machines. This point system attempts to align awarded credit with the value of the scientific results.|$|E

This research refers to the previous research by Haryo Kuncoro (2007). The object of this research is the Performance of Regional <b>Work</b> <b>Units</b> (SKPD) of Semarang City and Country. This research was using a purposive sampling method. The data used are secondary data, obtained from the Financial Report of the Performance of Regional <b>Work</b> <b>Units</b> (SKPD) of Semarang City and Country from 2007 until 2009.

25|$|By 1987 {{rural society}} was {{more open and}} diverse than in the 1960s and 1970s, and the rigid {{collective}} units of that period, which had reflected the state's overwhelming concern for security, {{had been replaced by}} networks and clusters of smaller units. The new, looser structure demonstrated the priority placed on efficiency and economic growth. Basic security, in the sense of an adequate supply of food and guarantees of support for the disabled, orphaned, or aged, was taken for granted. Less than half of China's population remembered the insecurity and risks of pre-1950 society, but the costs and inefficiencies of the collective system were fresh in their minds. Increased specialization and division of labor were trends not likely to be reversed. In the rural areas the significance of the <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> appeared to have diminished, although people still lived in villages, and the actions of low-level administrative cadres still affected ordinary farmers or petty traders in immediate ways.|$|E
25|$|One {{disadvantage}} of this feature {{is that the}} computers which are actually performing the calculations might not be entirely trustworthy. The designers of the system must thus introduce measures to prevent malfunctions or malicious participants from producing false, misleading, or erroneous results, and from using the system as an attack vector. This often involves assigning work randomly to different nodes (presumably with different owners) and checking {{that at least two}} different nodes report the same answer for a given <b>work</b> <b>unit.</b> Discrepancies would identify malfunctioning and malicious nodes. However, {{due to the lack of}} central control over the hardware, there is no way to guarantee that nodes will not drop out of the network at random times. Some nodes (like laptops or dial-up Internet customers) may also be available for computation but not network communications for unpredictable periods. These variations can be accommodated by assigning large work units (thus reducing the need for continuous network connectivity) and reassigning work units when a given node fails to report its results in expected time.|$|E
5|$|Before public release, <b>work</b> <b>units</b> {{go through}} several quality {{assurance}} steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home. Folding@home's <b>work</b> <b>units</b> are normally processed only once, {{except in the}} rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution.

30|$|The worst {{performance}} was obtained with VMR- 30 R 2, when using more reduce <b>work</b> <b>units,</b> {{with a low}} replication factor. This {{is due to the}} increased probability of a slow or faulty node being assigned a reduce task. With 30 reduce <b>work</b> <b>units,</b> and a replication factor of 2, there are 60 tasks that may negatively impact the MapReduce jobâ€™s turnaround time. On VMR- 15 R 2 there are only 15 reduce <b>work</b> <b>units,</b> which translates to half the total number of tasks.|$|R

500|$|A <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> is {{the protein}} data {{that the client}} is asked to process. Work units are a {{fraction}} of the simulation between the states in a Markov state model. After the <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> has been downloaded and completely processed by a volunteer's computer, it is returned to Folding@home servers, which then award the volunteer the credit points. [...] This cycle repeats automatically. All work units have associated deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding occurs serially, and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> is not returned after a reasonable period of time. Due to these deadlines, the minimum system requirement for Folding@home is a Pentium3 450MHz CPU with Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE). However, work units for high-performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as {{a major part of the}} scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.|$|E
500|$|Prisoners were {{generally}} divided into camp by rank. Officers, given different status to other ranks, were imprisoned in Oflags (short for Offizierslager or [...] "Officers' Camp") while NCOs and other ranks were imprisoned in Stalags (or Stammlager). The {{vast majority of}} prisoners ( [...] 93 percent) were not confined behind barbed wire, but instead worked in German factories or in farms, sometimes without guards. Each prison camp comprised both the camp itself, {{as well as a}} Kommando (<b>Work</b> <b>unit)</b> which could be hundreds of kilometers from the main camp itself.|$|E
500|$|Sayn-Wittgenstein {{attended}} numerous {{schools in}} various locations, including a private tutor at Lake Geneva, {{a boarding school}} in Neubeuern in Upper Bavaria, a brief stay at Davos in Switzerland, and a private school in Montreux. He received his Abitur from the Realgymnasium, a higher education facility, in Freiburg im Breisgau on 17 December 1935. He joined the Hitler Youth on 12April 1932 in Freiburg. On 15January 1933, he became a KameradschaftsfÃ¼hrer (group leader). From Easter 1933 until fall of 1933 he led the group's military-sports activities as a Wehrsportleiter. He then became head of the instruction unit until May 1934.

500|$|However, the {{campaign}} was unsettling to othersâ€”particularly the intelligentsia. A 57-year-old lawyer told The Washington Post, [...] "I saw the beatings of the teachers by the Red Guards. It was horribleâ€¦Young people may not recognize it. But for us who lived through it, how can we possibly sing?" [...] An academic quoted in The Daily Telegraph described the mandatory campaign as akin to being [...] "drowned in a Red sea." [...] In September 2009, a mid-level official in the city committed suicide after being pressured to organize his <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> {{to participate in the}} red songs campaign. The official, Xie Dajun, reportedly disagreed with {{the campaign}}, which evoked painful memories of the Cultural Revolution.

500|$|Specialized {{molecular}} dynamics programs, {{referred to as}} [...] "FahCores" [...] and often abbreviated [...] "cores", perform the calculations on the <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> as a background process. A large majority of Folding@home's cores are based on GROMACS, {{one of the fastest}} and most popular {{molecular dynamics}} software packages, which largely consists of manually optimized assembly language code and hardware optimizations. Although GROMACS is open-source software and there is a cooperative effort between the Pande lab and GROMACS developers, Folding@home uses a closed-source license to help ensure data validity. Less active cores include ProtoMol and SHARPEN. Folding@home has used AMBER, CPMD, Desmond, and TINKER, but these have since been retired and are no longer in active service. Some of these cores perform explicit solvation calculations in which the surrounding solvent (usually water) is modeled atom-by-atom; while others perform implicit solvation methods, where the solvent is treated as a mathematical continuum. The core is separate from the client to enable the scientific methods to be updated automatically without requiring a client update. The cores periodically create calculation checkpoints so that if they are interrupted they can resume work from that point upon startup.|$|E

2500|$|The {{quality of}} Higher {{education}} {{at various times}} in modern China has changed at various times, reflecting the changes in political policies implemented by the central government. Following {{the founding of the}} PRC, in 1949, the Chinese government's educational focus was largely on political [...] "re-education". In periods of political upheaval, such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, ideology was stressed over professional or technical competence. During {{the early stages of the}} Cultural Revolution (1966-1969), tens of thousands of college students joined Red Guard organizations, which persecuted many university faculty members as [...] "counter-revolutionaries" [...] and effectively closed China's universities. When universities reopened in the early 1970s, enrollments were reduced from pre-Cultural Revolution levels, and admission was restricted to individuals who had been recommended by their <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> (danwei), possessed good political credentials, and had distinguished themselves in manual labor. In the absence of stringent and reasonably objective entrance examinations, political connections became increasingly important in securing the recommendations and political dossiers necessary to qualify for university admission. As a result, the decline in educational quality was profound. Deng Xiaoping reportedly wrote Mao Zedong in 1975 that university graduates were [...] "not even capable of reading a book" [...] in their own fields when they left the university. University faculty and administrators were demoralized by the political aspects of the university system.|$|E
2500|$|SETI@home was {{conceived}} by David Gedye along with Craig Kasnoff {{and is a}} popular volunteer distributed computing project that was launched by the University of California, Berkeley, in May 1999. It was originally funded by The Planetary Society and Paramount Pictures, and later {{by the state of}} California. The project is run by director David P. Anderson and chief scientist Dan Werthimer. Any individual can become involved with SETI research by downloading the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) software program, attaching to the SETI@home project, and allowing the program to run as a background process that uses idle computer power. The SETI@home program itself runs signal analysis on a [...] "work unit" [...] of data recorded from the central 2.5MHz wide band of the SERENDIP IV instrument. After computation on the <b>work</b> <b>unit</b> is complete, the results are then automatically reported back to SETI@home servers at University of California, Berkeley. By June 28, 2009, the SETI@home project had over 180,000 active participants volunteering a total of over 290,000 computers. These computers give SETI@home an average computational power of 617 teraFLOPS. In 2004 radio source SHGb02+14a set off speculation in the media that a signal had been detected but researchers noted the frequency drifted rapidly and the detection on three SETI@home computers fell within random chance.|$|E
