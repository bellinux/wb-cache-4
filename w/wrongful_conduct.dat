Hodge has argued that [...] "acceptance of the narrower view would not only impose upon a person seeking to establish a secret trust the heavy onus of showing at what point of time the secret trustee decided to resile from his promise, but would also make the validity of the secret trust dependent upon what is in fact an irrelevant consideration".|$|E

This definition clearly encompasses two separate <b>wrongful</b> <b>conducts</b> by different actors. It is less clear how international responsibility arises for both the aggressor state and the individual, and why responsibility for the latter can be predicated only upon the former. This dissertation analyses the way in which aggression is attributed to the aggressor State and the individual, and how State and individual responsibility is delineated from each other, with a particular focus on the legal interest of the aggressed State. First, the argument considers the way in which international law prohibits and criminalizes aggression, elaborating international obligations of States and individuals in that regard (Part I). It then analyses the interconnection between obligations of States to refrain from an act of aggression and obligations of individuals to refrain from conduct relating to the crime of aggression (Part II). Finally, the enforcement against the crime of aggression in the ICC and domestic courts is explored (Part III) ...|$|R

40|$|Alcohol {{consumption}} {{is one of}} our species’ vestiges. Fermentation was discovered in prehistoric times and that is why its history appears parallel to the evolution of mankind. Alcohol {{consumption is}} conceived as a social behavior, hence as a cultural rite, which has been source to a culture of alcohol. In ancient times, it was conceived as a mystical and cathartic experience; in the Middle Ages, as the deserved punishment of the poor; in the 19 th century, as an addiction; and in the 20 th century, as a risky chronic disease. Nowadays, the medical concerns for alcohol predominate in the area of health. So does the management of “alcohol risks“ at work. Hence, medical, social and legal aspects of the problem are to be taken into consideration. According to the 2014 World Health Organization’s report, in 15 years Europe’s average alcohol consumption will be twice the World’s. The traditional dichotomy between countries with “wet cultures” and those with “dry cultures” is disappearing and being homogenized in new ways of risky consumption that spread in younger populations. In this respect, Spain {{is considered to be a}} country in transition towards the “binge drinking” model; whereas in France the above mentioned model is already deeply settled. Nevertheless, both cases predict important social, medical and labor repercussions. This cultural change of consumption habits is forcing governments to undertake prevention policies to face today’s high-risk alcohol consumption and its ruinous demographic and economic consequences. Both from a social and an individual perspective, alcohol consumption has its bigger impact on a country’s morbidity, mortality and epidemiology rates and its economy alike. At work, alcohol consumption is measured following economic and subjective criteria and assessing its negative repercussions in work performance. Working environment, business lunchs and parties can mean alcohol consumption at work; and so do pressure on workers, demands of productivity, the establishment of working objectives and stress. In all these cases, alcohol consumption may symbolize a relief from labor suffering. This double-edged sword turns alcohol into the most consumed drug by workers. The association of alcohol consumption to higher accident rates, to a drop in working performance, to work absenteeism, to an increase in <b>wrongful</b> <b>conducts</b> or in labor risks triggers prevention policies that aim to diminish the risks for the employable population derived from alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption has been source to many different studies based on both its social and medical repercussions, but none of them seems to have dealt with the medical-legal approach of case law. Through judicial decisions – conceived as the social mirror of conflict resolution – and through combining the realms of Medicine and Law, this thesis aims to provide a glimpse into the problem of alcohol consumption within the workforce [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, School of Law, 2014. This thesis {{explores the}} {{sufficiency}} {{and effectiveness of}} legal guarantees for the socioeconomic rights of refugees in Southern Africa. In order to achieve effective protection of these rights for refugees, the thesis argues that legal and policy responses to refugeehood should distinguish between political and humanitarian refugees. This distinction is necessary for principled as well as pragmatic reasons. Political refugees are forced to flee from their own countries by reason of <b>wrongful</b> rights-violating <b>conduct</b> by the State; or similar conduct by non-state actors but with the acquiescence of State authorities; and they seek substitute State protection and political community membership in other countries. The thesis argues that political refugees ought to be accorded preferential treatment over other foreign nationals who are not members of the host State’s political community. These include humanitarian refugees who, by contrast, are compelled to flee {{their country of origin}} due to various factors that threaten to seriously harm their lives; but which are neither directly nor indirectly attributable to <b>wrongful</b> State <b>conduct.</b> Based on this distinction, the thesis critiques international and domestic legal instruments, exploring the extent to which socioeconomic rights are guaranteed for refugees in the region. On the international plane, the thesis observes that international human rights law proceeds from the premise that nationals and foreign nationals ought to receive equal human rights guarantees, including in the sphere of socioeconomic rights, but that limitations on these rights, premised on nationality, are permissible based on reasonable and objective criteria. A problem with this position is that it makes no special case for the necessary preferential treatment that political refugees ought to receive in comparison with other foreign nationals. On the domestic front, the general position in the region is that the socioeconomic rights of foreign nationals, including refugees, are only narrowly guaranteed. This is in contrast with the general principle of international law that nationals and foreign nationals should receive equal treatment with only limited exceptions permitted. Further, this domestic position does not comport with the principled case for the preferential treatment of political refugees over other foreign nationals that the ix thesis advocates. In order to achieve a more effective guarantee of socioeconomic rights for refugees in the region, the thesis recommends that States in the region should comprehensively entrench these rights in applicable Bills of Rights. It also argues that courts in the region should be more progressive in their interpretation and application of the Bills of Rights. These measures should be blended with legal provisions that provide for a split between political refugees and humanitarian refugees in terms of the standards of treatment. There is also need for the harmonisation of domestic refugee law regimes, as well as a well-defined scheme of refugee burden-sharing, in the region...|$|R

This article reflects the recent developments in the States’ technological capacity to identify the sources of cyber attacks from the perspective of international law. It revisits Article 8 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility in order to ‘decode’ its contents vis-à-vis its drafting history and with an eye on its future application to the conduct in cyberspace. The article argues that there are three autonomous standards of attribution built into that provision: instructions, direction, and control. It then demonstrates the utility and limitations of each of them against the backdrop of actual and hypothetical cyber operations.

40|$|This Article {{addresses}} the timely and controversial topic of constitutional limits on punitive damages and brings a criminal punishment theory perspective {{to the analysis}} of this issue. The question of how to determine when punishment is unconstitutionally excessive has been and continues to be a subject of intense debate in the courts and scholarly circles. The United States Supreme Court has subjected criminal sanctions, criminal forfeitures, and punitive damages to a proportionality requirement, but the Court uses different approaches to the proportionality analysis {{depending on the type of}} punishment. In the criminal context, the Court has retreated in large part from proportionality review, deferring to legislative maxima for criminal sentences. By contrast, where there is no legislative cap on the punitive damages a jury can award, the Court has undertaken a more active role in determining the proportionality of punitive damages. Similarly, where there is no legislative limit to the amount of property that can be forfeited, the Court has engaged in a more active proportionality review. An analysis of the Supreme Court's different proportionality reviews demonstrates that the different approaches are explained by the presence or absence of legislative limits on punishment. This Article examines the nature of punishment and the requirements for just punishment-notice, proportionality, and limits-and applies these principles to punitive damages. It concludes that a system that imposes no limits on the amount of punitive damages awards contravenes the principle of notice and leaves courts with little guidance in assessing the excessiveness of particular awards. To bring punitive damages into conformity with the principles of just punishment and to provide courts with a benchmark for evaluating the proportionality of punitive damages awards, the Article concludes with proposals for legislative limits on such awards. Because of the importance of limits on punishment, including punitive damages, this Article suggests how states can impose caps on punitive damages awards that serve the policy interests of punishing and deterring <b>wrongful</b> and harmful <b>conduct,</b> and how states can use caps to justify large awards in appropriate cases that will survive excessiveness challenges...|$|R

40|$|Where there's smoke, there's fire"' says {{a venerable}} adage that informs {{many of our}} {{everyday}} decisions. Although what looks like smoke may have a cause other than fire, smoke is so often the indicator of fire that it is rarely a bad strategy to presume the presence of fire from the observation of smoke. Similarly, when a promised payment does not arrive we assume it was not sent, even though checks sometimes do {{get lost in the}} mail. When a road is slippery in winter we presume the cause is ice, even though it could be spilled oil. And when a physician sees yellowing skin and nausea she concludes that her patient has hepatitis, although some rare diseases produce identical symptoms. Yet although it is common to infer a cause from the presence of its typical indicator, much of legal and regulatory practice is to the contrary. In criminal, civil, and regulatory law, we are often more reluctant to take action based on the likely cause of an observed consequence than a physician is to prescribe treatment based on the likely cause of observed symptoms. On the whole, our regulatory apparatus appears to believe that it needs more direct evidence than is provided by the inference from observed smoke to unseen fire, and that individuals subject to regulation, liability, or punishment must be given an opportunity to demonstrate that even the most reliable of indicators has produced the wrong conclusion in their particular case. The inferential logic lying behind "Where there's smoke, there's fire" may be satisfactory for presuming the existence of fire, it seems, but not for presuming the existence liability-incurring acts. In this Article we argue that the common aversion to what we can call 'evidentiary regulation' or 'regulation by generalization' makes little sense. Although it is often thought repugnant to hold people legally responsible on the basis of probabilistically reliable but non-universal indicators of <b>wrongful</b> or regulable <b>conduct,</b> we argue that this reaction is a product of undue skepticism about probabilistic inference coupled with undue faith in the reliability and costlessness of eyewitness and other forms of sensory observation. Moreover, even the most seemingly direct forms of regulation, the typical speed limit, for example, rely on inferences closely related to the inference from smoke to fire. Accordingly, using "Where there's smoke, there's fire" as a heuristic for regulation may turn out to have more merit than is commonly believed. ...|$|R

40|$|Culture, like race, class, gender, sexual {{orientation}} and wealth {{is one of}} many ways in which the law is not neutral. Indeed, culture is a source of law. Yet, as traditional legal positivists have taught us, the law or legal doctrine can prove to be more powerful than culture, often outlasting it. The “mirror image” theory states that the laws of a particular locale reflect the culture of that locale. The law merely serves as enforcement of the common decency, propriety and morality of that culture. Not only is this understanding appealingly simple, it is often invoked by judges and legislators who see the law and their roles in shaping the law as nothing more than an expression of the common sense and morality of their communities. However, as leading scholars in this area explain, this simplistic mirror image of law and culture is not true. First, the law does not merely enforce cultural norms; indeed, the law frequently creates new norms which may be contrary to cultural tendencies. Second, culture itself is not stable, coherent, or singular, and thus its malleability challenges the law. Within any culture, there are differences among subgroups, inconsistency and conflict between tenets, variance in adherence, and ever constant change. In countries harboring a multitude of cultures, like the United States, this second complication is even more palpable. Given multiple cultures, the likelihood of differences in values and moral sensibilities is multiplied. Whose norms should the law reflect? Which values should the law pursue? For those countries that regard their diversity as an asset, the challenge is how to balance respect for cultural heterogeneity against the need to enforce a distinctive and hegemonic set of cultural values. This Essay focuses on the interplay between culture and the substantive criminal law. The criminal law has two basic functions: it serves as an expression of moral condemnation, and it determines formal punishment by the state. Given the importance of these functions, it is imperative that the complex interplay between culture and the criminal law is brought to light and understood, especially in multi-cultural jurisdictions where a single criminal law is brought to bear upon members of numerous, varying cultures. The relationship between culture and the criminal law reflects the mirror image theory as well as two complications identified by Robert Post. For example, the laws against homicide articulate that in the judgment of most, if not all cultures, killing another human being, under most circumstances, is <b>wrongful</b> moral <b>conduct</b> and is therefore, a crime. Such laws are a clear example of the mirror image theory. On {{the other end of the}} spectrum, other criminal offenses such as marijuana possession do not necessarily reflect a societal judgment against low level drug use, but instead represent the need to maintain a distinction between illicit and legal drugs and the need to deter the abuse of even more dangerous drugs. This is the first complication suggested by Post at work. Such drug offenses aspire to create norms, as opposed to reflecting already existing norms, and are very controversial. This debate about whether rules of liability should be fashioned to achieve the instrumental goal of deterrence or instead to reflect the moral judgment of the community in criminal law is “fierce and ongoing. ” The second complication of differences in norms and values due to the existence of many cultures and intra-cultural conflict is also seen in criminal law. It usually arises in the context of a defendant who is charged with a crime but then defends his act as an expression of his culture. Whether the criminal law should accept a claim of culture as a defense has been the subject of numerous academic articles; however, very few, if any, jurisdictions have formally considered the issue. In this Essay, Prof. Chiu argues that several familiar doctrines in American criminal law are better understood as cultural constructs. These fundamental doctrines reflect the values of the dominant culture in the United States. They are: (1) the rejection of the rule of retreat in deadly self-defense; (2) the defense of habitation; and (3) the defense against forcible rape. These defense doctrines demonstrate simple mirror reflection as well as Post 2 ̆ 7 s second complication of changes in culture. By viewing these established criminal defenses specifically as constructs of the dominant culture, this Essay puts forth a selective mirror image theory. The criminal law is yet another source of power for the segment of the population that is in control. Thus, the values expressed in the substantive criminal law are those held by that segment. This view of the law is an important place to begin our look at culture and the criminal law. It achieves two important ends. First, the Essay dispels the myth that culture does not exist or belong in the substantive criminal law. Those who worry that a cultural defense will inject culture where there is no culture have no reason to worry. The current criminal law is already infused with culture. Second, this Essay establishes that it is not just any culture that exists in the criminal law. Rather, it is only the dominant culture that exists in American criminal law. These foundational perspectives about substantive criminal law are critical to understand and accept before going further in the study of the relationship between criminal law and culture. Part II of this Essay explains two concepts that are important to these foundational perspectives. The first discusses the meaning of dominant culture, and the second explores the connection between culture and motive in the criminal law. Parts III, IV, and V then explore in detail how the rejection of the rule of retreat, the defense of habitation and the defense against forcible rape are expressions of the dominant culture. Finally, Part VI features some brief conclusory remarks...|$|R
