5|$|The Dakota were {{hunters and}} gatherers and soon found {{themselves}} in debt to fur traders. Pressed by a <b>whooping</b> cough outbreak, loss of buffalo, deer, and bear, and loss of forests to logging, in 1851 in the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux, the Mdewakanton sold the remaining land west of the river, allowing settlement in 1852.|$|E
5|$|California condors {{have the}} largest {{wingspan}} of any North American bird. They are surpassed in both body length and weight only by the trumpeter swan and the introduced mute swan. The American white pelican and <b>whooping</b> crane also have longer bodies than the condor. Condors are so large {{that they can be}} mistaken for a small, distant airplane, which possibly occurs more often than they are mistaken for other species of bird.|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that vocal signals communicate information about the age, sex and affective state of callers. However, the mechanisms by which these types of information are communicated are less well understood. Here we investigated variation in the acoustic properties of the long-distance vocalizations, called ‘whoops’, emitted by free-living spotted hyenas, Crocuta crocuta. Specifically we investigated whether the fundamental frequency, length and rate of <b>whoops</b> provide information about the caller’s age, sex and/or level of arousal. We determined the latter by contrasting <b>whoops</b> emitted spontaneously with <b>whoops</b> emitted during periods of social excitement, when callers typically also exhibited visual sig-nals associated with heightened arousal. We found that the minimum fundamental frequency of a <b>whoop</b> provides reliable information about the caller’s general age and, for adult callers, information about sex as well. The vast majority of adult male <b>whoop</b> bouts were emitted spontaneously, but juveniles and adult females produced many of their bouts during periods of social excitement. Although context did not significantly affect the <b>whoop</b> bouts of adult females, juvenile bouts emitted during social excitement had higher maximum fundamental frequencies, greater proportions of asymmetric <b>whoop</b> subtypes, and reduced inter-whoo...|$|R
5|$|In {{the area}} around Green Lake there are forests of pecan, black willow, cedar, American elm, {{hackberry}} and green ash. To the south, the Guadalupe Delta Wildlife Management Area serves as a wetland habitat for thousands of permanent egrets, and other birds, including the brown pelican, reddish egret, white-faced ibis, wood stork, bald eagle, white-tailed hawk, peregrine falcon, and the <b>whooping</b> crane. American alligators reside in the area as well.|$|E
5|$|St. Charles Bay is an inlet of Aransas Bay in Aransas County, Texas. It is {{flanked by}} Lamar {{peninsula}} on the west and Blackjack peninsula on the east. The bay hosts a valued ecosystem for the endangered <b>whooping</b> crane, and is a prime location for birding and fishing. Goose Island State Park and the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge are located along the bay's shores, attracting nature enthusiasts year-round.|$|E

5|$|Saint Charles Bay {{serves as}} a habitat for {{approximately}} 300 species of birds. Birders venture to the site between November and March, when the creatures winter near the bay. The endangered <b>whooping</b> crane, the largest bird in North America, is the most highly prized sight as {{only a few hundred}} remain, including three families on St. Charles Bay. The bird was near extinction in the early 20th century, as only two flocks between Canada and Texas remained. The population increased following the organization of the Aransas Migratory Waterfowl Refuge in 1937, after the Federal government purchased the land of the St. Charles ranch from San Antonio oilman Leroy G. Denman, using funds from commemorative stamps. The Refuge later became known as the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. <b>Whooping</b> cranes are also protected by Goose Island State Park, which was established by the State of Texas in 1931. Other birds that migrate to the bay include the sandhill crane, American white pelican, brown pelican, roseate spoonbill, great blue heron and Canada goose. The blue crab and other shellfish, help sustain the bird population. Thirty seven species of mammals are found on Blackjack peninsula, including white-tailed deer, nine-banded armadillos and collared peccaries. The spotted seatrout and redfish are the common finfish that reside in the bay. While trout are generally found in the bay's deeper waters, redfish live in shallow waters; their tail fins can be spotted above the surface during the peak summer and fall months. The bay also supports a healthy population of American alligators, which reside in shallow waters. Signs alert visitors to be careful.|$|E
5|$|Tucker's {{maritime}} {{roots in}} Bermuda instilled {{an interest in}} navigation, and he began an intense campaign with the legislatures of North Carolina and Virginia to improve the waterways to Norfolk along the Roanoke, Dan, and Staunton Rivers, {{in order to avoid}} inefficient portage required to Petersburg and Richmond. This effort culminated in his own bids for election to a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates representing Pittsylvania County, which failed in 1813 and 1814 but then succeeded in 1816. Tucker and Maria then suffered the first loss of a child, Harriett, from <b>whooping</b> cough at age three.|$|E
5|$|African {{tribes in}} several {{countries}} have termites as totems, {{and for this reason}} tribe members are forbidden to eat the reproductive alates. Termites are widely used in traditional popular medicine; they are used as treatments for diseases and other conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, hoarseness, influenza, sinusitis, tonsillitis and <b>whooping</b> cough. In Nigeria, Macrotermes nigeriensis is used for spiritual protection and to treat wounds and sick pregnant women. In Southeast Asia, termites are used in ritual practices. In Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, termite mounds are commonly worshiped among the populace. Abandoned mounds are viewed as structures created by spirits, believing a local guardian dwells within the mound; this is known as Keramat and Datok Kong. In urban areas, local residents construct red-painted shrines over mounds that have been abandoned, where they pray for good health, protection and luck.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Concurrency errors, such as data races, make device drivers {{notoriously}} hard {{to develop}} and debug without automated tool support. We present <b>WHOOP,</b> a new automated approach that statically analyzes drivers for data races. <b>WHOOP</b> is empowered by symbolic pairwise lockset analysis, a novel analysis that can soundly detect all potential races in a driver. Our analysis avoids reasoning about thread interleavings and thus scales well. Exploiting the race-freedom guarantees provided by <b>WHOOP,</b> we achieve a sound partial-order reduction that sig-nificantly accelerates CORRAL, an industrial-strength bug-finder for concurrent programs. Using the combination of <b>WHOOP</b> and CORRAL, we analyzed 16 drivers from the Linux 4. 0 kernel, achieving 1. 5 – 20 × speedups over standalone CORRAL. I...|$|R

5|$|As the 1876 presidential {{election}} approached, Garfield was {{loyal to the}} candidacy of Senator Blaine, and fought for the former Speaker's nomination at the 1876 Republican National Convention in Cincinnati. When it became clear, after six ballots, that Blaine could not prevail, the convention nominated Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes. Although Garfield had supported Blaine, he had kept good relations with Hayes, and wholeheartedly supported the governor. Garfield had hoped to retire from politics after his term expired to devote himself full-time {{to the practice of}} law, but to help his party, he sought re-election, and won it easily that October. Any celebration was short lived, as Garfield's youngest son, Neddie, fell ill with <b>whooping</b> cough shortly after the congressional election, and soon died.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from <b>whooping</b> cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E
5|$|Copano Bay is a northwestern {{extension}} of Aransas Bay, west of Rockport, Texas in Refugio and Aransas counties. It is supplied with seawater from the Gulf of Mexico via Aransas Bay, and fed freshwater from the Aransas River, Mission River and Copano Creek. As an estuary, the bay {{is home to}} a diverse ecosystem consisting of various birds including the endangered <b>whooping</b> crane, and numerous finfish including the redfish as well as shellfish such as oysters. It is classified as a nursery for shrimp, which prohibits production from the bay. Copano Bay is also a historic location for human usage and settlement that dates back to the 18th century, beginning with the historic port of El Copano and the 19th century settlements of St. Mary's of Aransas and Copano. The present-day towns of Bayside, Copano Village and Holiday Beach were all founded in the 20th century. Oil and natural gas are pumped from below the bay's surface, and contribute to the livelihood of the local economies. Recently, areas around the bay were affected by Hurricane Harvey which crossed over the bay as a Category 3 hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Over 300 {{species of}} birds have been sighted in the park {{including}} the calliope hummingbird, the smallest bird species in North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America's largest waterfowl. In addition to trumpeter swans, another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including blue-winged teal, common merganser, American wigeon and the colorful but reclusive harlequin duck which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon. Both bald and golden eagles and other birds of prey such as the osprey, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel and occasional sightings of peregrine falcon have been reported. Of the 14 species of owls reported, the most common is the great horned owl, though the boreal owl and great grey owl are also seen occasionally. A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported, as have a similar number of species of warblers, plovers and gulls. The vocal and gregarious black-billed magpie frequents campgrounds while Steller's jay and Clark's nutcracker {{are found in the}} backcountry. The sage covered plains of Jackson Hole are favored areas for sage grouse, Brewer's sparrow and sage thrashers, while the wetlands are frequented by great blue heron, American white pelican, sandhill crane and on rare occasions it's endangered relative, the <b>whooping</b> crane.|$|E
5|$|Due to the storm's slow {{movement}} just offshore the Louisiana coast, {{the hurricane}} became the wettest tropical cyclone in state history, with numerous locations reporting record rainfall across the state. Of the state's ten highest official rainfall measurements associated with tropical cyclones, the two highest were measurements {{taken during the}} hurricane. Precipitation peaked at 37.5in (953mm) on Miller Island. For any given 20,000mi2 (50,000km/h2) area of Louisiana, the maximum rainfall averaged 12.1in (307.3mm). Thirteen official weather stations in the state reported monthly 24-hour rainfall total records. The highest of these was in Crowley, where 19.76in (501.9mm) of precipitation fell on August9; the station would record 33.71in (856.2mm) of rain {{over the course of}} the storm. The torrential rainfall submerged the city under 2ft (0.6m) of floodwater. In Cameron, the storm dropped 21in (533mm) of rain was reported. In St. Landry Parish, bayous flowed over their banks, causing refugees to evacuate to Opelousas. In the Acadiana region of southern Louisiana, the resulting floods were considered worse than the floods that resulted from the Sauvé's Crevasse in 1927. There, <b>whooping</b> crane populations were severely impacted by the rainfall, and only one was known to be alive by 1947. The floods inundated roughly 2,000,000acres (800,000hectares) of land in Louisiana. Much of the lowland areas remained underwater until October1940. As a result, cotton and corn crops experienced significant losses, as well as pecans. Livestock also saw large losses. Impassable areas caused by rising floodwaters prevented firefighters from extinguishing a fire which burned down much of the Shell Oil Company's offices and supply warehouses in the town of Iowa. Across the state, the hurricane caused $9million in damages, though only six fatalities resulted, relatively less than most storms of similar scale. The low death count was attributed to large evacuation procedures which underwent prior to the storm, as well as guidance provided from the newly opened Weather Bureau east of Lake Charles.|$|E

25|$|This {{family is}} also known as Ptx and {{contains}} the toxin responsible for <b>whooping</b> cough. Pertussis toxin is secreted by the gram-negative bacterium, Bordetella pertussis. <b>Whooping</b> cough is very contagious and cases are slowly increasing in the United States despite vaccination. Symptoms include paroxysmal cough with <b>whooping</b> and even vomiting. The bacterium Bordetella pertussis was first identified as the cause of <b>whooping</b> cough and isolated by Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou in France in 1900.|$|E
