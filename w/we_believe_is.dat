500|$|Daniels {{announced}} the first tuition freeze {{before the state}} had determined Purdue's funding for the next biennium. [...] Amidst questions about the timing, Daniels argued that he didn't need to wait because [...] "it doesn't matter what the General Assembly does. This {{is the right thing}} to do and we are going to do it...the same way families do; the same way some governments do and all businesses do. [...] We are going to adjust our spending to what <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> the available and in this case the fair amount of revenue. [...] I know often with good reason there has been an opportunity in higher education to adjust tuition to match what the place wanted to spend, and I just think we've reached the point where we ought to break that pattern." [...] The first tuition freeze required the university to find $40 million in savings or new revenue. In order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes, Daniels and the Purdue Board of Trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers, investing cash reserves and switching to a consumer-driven health plan for employees.|$|E

He also explains that [...] "Sonnet 65 makes use of the same words [...] and more or less specific notions, but it proceeds and culminates far more impressively," [...] in comparison to Sonnet 64. The last two couplets are Shakespeare's own summary on the theme that love itself is a [...] "miracle" [...] that time nor human intervention can destroy.|$|E

However, the Foreign Minister of the Palestinian Authority, Nabil Shaath, said: [...] "Whether a state is announced now or after liberation, its borders must be those of 4 June 1967.

60|$|At {{first sight}} we might imagine that {{knowledge}} could {{be defined as}} 'true belief'. When what <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> true, it might be supposed that we had achieved a knowledge of what we believe. But this would not accord with {{the way in which}} the word is commonly used. To take a very trivial instance: If a man believes that the late Prime Minister's last name began with a B, he believes what is true, since the late Prime Minister was Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman. But if he believes that Mr. Balfour was the late Prime Minister, he will still believe that the late Prime Minister's last name began with a B, yet this belief, though true, would not be thought to constitute knowledge. If a newspaper, by an intelligent anticipation, announces the result of a battle before any telegram giving the result has been received, it may by good fortune announce what afterwards turns out to be the right result, and it may produce belief in some of its less experienced readers. But in spite of the truth of their belief, they cannot be said to have knowledge. Thus it is clear that a true belief is not knowledge when it is deduced from a false belief.|$|E
60|$|Oct. 29.--Leaving this port, Columbus {{stood to}} the west, and having sailed six leagues, {{he came to}} a point of the island running N.W., which we take to be the Punta Gorda; and, ten leagues farther, another {{stretching}} easterly, which will be Punta Curiana. One league farther he discovered a small river, and beyond this another very large one, to which he gave the name of Rio de Mares. This river emptied into a fine basin resembling a lake, and having a bold entrance: it had for landmarks two round mountains at the S. W., and to the W.N.W. a bold promontory, suitable for a fortification, which projected far into the sea. This we take to be the fine harbor and river situated west of Point Curiana; its distance corresponds with that run by Columbus from Caravelas Grandes, which we have supposed identical with Port San Salvador. Leaving Rio de Mares the 30th of October, Columbus stood to the N. W. for fifteen leagues, when he saw a cape, to which he gave the name of Cabode Palmas. This, <b>we</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>is</b> the one which forms the eastern entrance to Laguna de Moron. Beyond this cape was a river, distant, according to the natives, four days' journey from the town of Cuba; Columbus determined therefore to make for it.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Johnson is {{the first}} of our Presidents who has descended to the stump, and spoken to the people as if they were a mob. We do not care to waste words in criticising the taste of this proceeding, but deem it our duty to comment on some of its graver aspects. We shall leave entirely aside {{whatever}} was personal in the extraordinary diatribe of the 22d of February, merely remarking that we believe the majority of Americans have too much good sense to be flattered by an allusion to the humbleness of their chief magistrate's origin; the matter of interest for them being rather to ascertain what he has arrived at than where he started from,--we do not mean in station, but in character, intelligence, and fitness for the place he occupies. We have reason to suspect, indeed, that pride of origin, whether high or low, springs from the same principle in human nature, and that one is but the positive, the other the negative, pole of a single weakness. The people do not take it as a compliment to be told that they have chosen a plebeian to the highest office, for they are not fond of a plebeian tone of mind or manners. What they do like, <b>we</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>is</b> to be represented by their foremost man, their highest type of courage, sense, and patriotism, no matter what his origin. For, after all, no one in this country incurs any natal disadvantage unless he be born to an ease which robs him of the necessity of exerting, and so of increasing and maturing, his natural powers. It is of very little consequence to know what our President was; of the very highest, to ascertain what he is, and {{to make the best of}} him. We may say, in passing, that the bearing of Congress, under the temptations of the last few weeks, has been most encouraging, though we must except from our commendation the recent speech of Mr. Stevens of Pennsylvania. There is a pride of patriotism that should make all personal pique seem trifling; and Mr. Stevens ought to have remembered that it was not so much the nakedness of an antagonist that he was uncovering as that of his country.|$|E

6000|$|Those young persons {{had not yet}} {{known each}} other a single day, yet both felt that {{confidence}} which years alone, in the crowds of the world, can ordinarily create in the human mind. The cause of the sympathy which draws heart to heart, which generates friendships, and love, and passionate attachments, is not obvious to all who choose to talk of it. There is yet a profound mystery in our organization, which has hitherto escaped the researches of both classes of philosophers, and which it probably was {{the design of the}} Creator should not be made known to us until we draw nearer to that great end which, sooner or later, is to be accomplished in behalf of our race, when [...] "knowledge will abound," [...] and we shall better understand our being and its objects, than is permitted to us in this our day of ignorance. But while we cannot trace the causes of a thousand things, we know and feel their effects. Among the other mysteries of our nature is this of sudden and strong sympathies, which, as between men for men, and women for women, awaken confidence and friendship; and as between those of different sexes, excite passionate attachments that more or less color their future lives. The great delineator of our common nature, in no one of the many admirable pictures he has drawn of men, manifests a more profound knowledge of his subject, than in that in which he portrays the sudden and nearly ungovernable inclination which Romeo and Juliet are made to display for each other; an inclination that sets reason, habit, prejudice, and family enmities at defiance. That such an attachment is to be commended, we do not say; that all can feel it, we do not believe; that connections formed under its influence can always be desirable, we are far from thinking: but that it may exist <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>is</b> just as certain as any of the incomprehensible laws of our wayward and yet admirable nature. We have no Veronese tale to relate here, however, but simply a homely legend, in which human feeling may occasionally be made to bear an humble resemblance to that world-renowned picture which had its scenes in the beautiful capital of Venetian Lombardy.|$|E
6000|$|The Indians ejaculated their assent; but Gershom {{was a man}} {{who could}} not express {{anything}} sententiously. As the bee-hunter led the way toward his cabin, or shanty, he made his comments with his customary freedom. Before recording what he communicated, however, we shall digress for one moment in order to say a word ourselves concerning this term [...] "shanty." [...] It is now in general use throughout the whole of the United States, meaning a cabin that has been constructed in haste, and for temporary purposes. By a license of speech, it is occasionally applied to more permanent residences, as men are known to apply familiar epithets to familiar objects. The derivation of the word has caused some speculation. The term certainly came from the West-perhaps from the Northwest-and the best explanation we have ever heard of its derivation is to sup-pose [...] "shanty," [...] as we now spell it, a corruption of [...] "chiente," [...] which it is thought may have been a word in Canadian French phrase to express a [...] "dog-kennel." [...] "Chenil," [...] <b>we</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>is</b> the true French term for such a thing, and our own word is said to be derived from it--"meute" [...] meaning [...] "a kennel of dogs," [...] or [...] "a pack of hounds," [...] rather than their dwelling. At any rate, [...] "chiente" [...] is so plausible a solution of the difficulty, that one may hope it is the true one, even though he has no better authority for it than a very vague rumor. Curious discoveries are sometimes made by these rude analogies, however, though they are generally thought not to be very near akin to learning. For ourselves, now, we do not entertain a doubt that the sobriquet of [...] "Yankees" [...] which is in every man's mouth, and of which the derivation appears to puzzle all our philologists, is nothing but a slight corruption of the word [...] "Yengeese," [...] the term applied to the [...] "English," [...] by the tribes to whom they first became known. We have no other authority for this derivation than conjecture, and conjectures that are purely our own; but it is so very plausible as almost to carry conviction of itself. [Footnote: Since writing the above, the author has met with an allusion that has induced him to think he {{may not have been the}} first to suggest this derivation of the word [...] "Yankee." [...] With himself, the suggestion is perfectly original, and has long since been published by him; but nothing is more probable than the fact that a solution so very natural, of this long-disputed question in language, may have suggested itself to various minds.] ...|$|E
6000|$|So {{much for}} the master's motto, [...] "Every man in his place." [...] Next for the laborer's motto, [...] "Every man his chance." [...] Let us mend that for them a little, and say, [...] "Every man his certainty"--certainty, {{that if he does}} well, he will be honored, and aided, and {{advanced}} in such degree as may be fitting for his faculty and consistent with his peace; and equal certainty that if he does ill, he will by sure justice be judged, and by sure punishment be chastised; if it may be, corrected; and if that may not be, condemned. That is the right reading of the Republican motto, [...] "Every man his chance." [...] And then, with such a system of government, pure, watchful and just, you may approach your great problem of national education, or in other words, of national employment. For all education begins in work. What we think, or what we know; or what <b>we</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>is</b> in the end, of little consequence. The only thing of consequence is what we do; and for man, woman, or child, the first point of education is to make them do their best. It is the law of good economy {{to make the best of}} everything. How much more to make the best of every creature! Therefore, when your pauper comes to you and asks for bread, ask of him instantly--What faculty have you? What can you do best? Can you drive a nail into wood? Go and mend the parish fences. Can you lay a brick? Mend the walls of the cottages where the wind comes in. Can you lift a spadeful of earth? Turn this field up three feet deep all over. Can you only drag a weight with your shoulders? Stand at the bottom of this hill and help up the overladen horses. Can you weld iron and chisel stone? Fortify this wreck-strewn coast into a harbor; and change these shifting sands into fruitful ground. Wherever death was, bring life; that is to be your work; that your parish refuge; that your education. So and no otherwise can we meet existent distress. But for the continual education of the whole people, and for their future happiness, they must have such consistent employment as shall develop all the powers of the fingers, and the limbs, and the brain: and that development is only to be obtained by hand-labor, of which you have these four great divisions--hand-labor on the earth, hand-labor on the sea, hand-labor in art, hand-labor in war. Of the last two of these I cannot speak to-night, and of the first two only with extreme brevity.|$|E
