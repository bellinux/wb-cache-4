So the founder of Mysidia, the great magician Ming-Wu, broke the Crystal into eight pieces. He then scattered the shards to the four winds. He did so to assure later restoration of the Magicite Crystal...when all eight pieces are brought together again." ...|$|E

Ramiro Burr of Billboard magazine believed that the song could have easily been successful in European clubs thanks to its striking resemblance to Euro-pop and Eurodance songs that were popular in Europe at the time. Tom Whitehurst Jr. of the Corpus Christi Caller Times wrote {{that he did not know}} what [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] meant but, after a friend played him a tape of the recording, he became a fan of the singer. Andrew Mitchell, also from the Corpus Christi Caller Times, called the song [...] "happy" [...] and said that it was [...] "only natural to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> meaning of , not just memorize [...] lyrics to sing along. Music can teach. It can remove barriers of the mind and soul." [...] Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle, called the song [...] "bouncy". Musicologists Ilan Stavans and Harold Augenbraum called [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom", [...] "No Me Queda Más", and [...] "Techno Cumbia" [...] the [...] "key hits of [...] ". Peter Watrous of The New York Times called the song [...] "lightweight" [...] but found it to be: [...] "better than [...] ". Sue Anne Pressley of the Washington Post wrote that [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] was [...] "sprightly carefree", and [...] "infectious". Writing for the San Antonio Express-News, Michael Clark complimented A.B.'s addition of [...] "world-music flourishes" [...] to the song. Katherine Seligman, also from the San Antonio Express News, described the recording as an: [...] "infectiously happy song". Sun Sentinel contributor, Steve Bennett also called the recording [...] "infectious".|$|E

500|$|William J. Bell {{had created}} the {{character}} of Phillip Chancellor III in 1976, and he remained {{a vital part of}} the soap opera's storylines until his death onscreen in 1989. In 2007, Latham rewrote Chancellor's birth by establishing that Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), Jill's enemy and Phillip Chancellor II's wife, switched their child with another hours after his birth; the character was brought back to the series as an adult named Cane Ashby, an Australian looking for his birth mother. During that time, Goddard did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> real motives of his character because he did not want that to influence his performance. After the revelation that Jill was Cane's mother, his views changed, saying he [...] "now welcomed the information as it added more color to his portrayal". The initial lack of information made portraying Cane difficult since there was an amount of ambiguity over whether he was a good, bad, or mediocre character. The ambiguity deepened when Goddard read the script revealing that a DNA test performed for Jill and Cane came back negative. He stated that he had never asked Latham [...] "what was going on" [...] with the storyline, but told her that he could [...] "play anything he needed to". A second DNA test later confirmed Cane as Jill's son. Goddard also said it was [...] "too good to be true" [...] for Cane to be Jill's son, adding that, [...] "But, down the road you realize these people actually do care about you, that you can reciprocate that care. For Cane, he's had so much time without them it's pointless to have the time with them and not enjoying it." [...] Though the maternity question was answered, more ambiguity about Cane's intentions appeared as the character received a phone call from his uncle Langley that hinted about Cane scheming against Jill and Katherine. The original intent of the call was to show that Cane wanted what was owed to him after being given away as an infant. The writers changed directions after the popularity of the character grew. Goddard said he felt the phone call was resolved within the story when Cane sent money to his uncle as part of taking care of him.|$|E

(b) In {{rejecting the}} idea that laws merely {{describe}} or independently ground phenomena, Hegel revives the Aristotlean position that law or principle is something implicit in a thing, a potentiality which is not actual but {{which is in the}} process of becoming actual.

Additionally, The WMA International Code of Medical Ethics explicitly states, [...] "“A physician shall...report to the appropriate authorities those physicians who practice unethically or incompetently or who engage in fraud or deception." [...] There is also the conflict with physicians who are tempted to report made up incidents or make an incident worse than what it was for their own personal motives.
