5|$|Brown was {{mentioned}} {{by the press}} in the expenses crisis for claiming for the payment of his cleaner. However, no wrongdoing was found and the Commons Authority did not pursue Brown over the claim. Meanwhile, the Commons Fees Office stated that a double payment for a £153 plumbing repair bill <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> on their part and that Brown had repaid it in full.|$|E
5|$|Co-writer Glen Morgan felt {{doing an}} episode on vampires <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> {{and said that}} they were also criticized for having Mulder fall for Kristen. Co-writer James Wong was also disappointed, saying that the script was a lot better than the show and that the episode was {{weakened}} when Fox censors had problems with the episode. Actor David Duchovny thought the episode had style, but suffered some lapses in logic, including the scene where Kristen shaves Mulder before the two kiss.|$|E

5|$|Most Polish historians {{agree that}} the Polish {{capitulation}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> both from the military perspective, and the political one. In the realm of military, the Poles had reasonable chances to defend the Vistula river line, and exhaust the Russian invading forces. From the political one, showing willingness to fight could have persuaded the partitioning powers that their plan was too costly.|$|E
5|$|Sheila's {{mental health}} {{continued}} to decline, with episodes of banging {{her head against}} walls. In 1983, her family doctor referred her to Dr. Hugh Ferguson, the psychiatrist who had treated June. Ferguson said she was in an agitated state, paranoid and psychotic. She was admitted to St Andrew's Hospital, a private psychiatric facility in Northampton, where {{she was diagnosed with}} schizoaffective disorder, although Ferguson said this diagnosis <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and that she was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Speaking {{after the}} game's release, Sonic Team member and Sonic and the Black Knight {{director}} Tetsu Katano remarked {{that although he}} did not feel the Werehog concept <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> time and resources were a limiting factor in the game's production. He also remarked that the Werehog may reappear in future games, or possibly in a sequel to Sonic Unleashed, should one be made.|$|E

5|$|At first, Schwarzkopf was {{ambivalent}} {{during the}} run-up to the Iraq War in 2003. He initially endorsed an invasion after Colin Powell's presentation to the United Nations on February 6, 2003. When weapons of mass destruction were not located in the country after the invasion, he changed his stance. He was critical of the lack of a reconstruction plan after the fall of Baghdad, feeling the initial offensive operations plans did {{not take into account the}} cultural complexities of Iraq. In 2004, he was critical of Donald Rumsfeld and his handling of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He felt it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> to send U.S. Army Reserve troops into the country without adequate training.|$|E
5|$|Bree and her husband, Orson (Kyle MacLachlan), find it {{increasingly}} difficult to stage her fake pregnancy. Their hoax is almost revealed at a neighborhood barbecue when a fork stabs her pregnancy stomach pads. Orson suggests coming clean to avoid the humiliation if their lies were to be discovered, but Bree tells him that this child is her second chance at successfully raising a child. Meanwhile, Susan worries that Mike is dissatisfied with their marriage, especially after Adam, her new gynecologist, reveals that she may be entering menopause. However, Adam later informs Susan that his earlier assessment <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and that she is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Cisneros and Martínez {{were arrested}} and charged with capital murder, which in Texas is {{punishable}} with a life sentence or death by lethal injection. Cisneros was taken to the Cameron County jail. On her way there, reporters asked if she was responsible for Fischer's murder, and she shook her head. Cisneros' husband also refused to comment. The police denied her bail, but her attorney said that she was a respected member of the Brownsville community and deserved bail. Cisneros's attorney told the press that the arrest <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> and that he was confident the police had no solid evidence against her. Police responded by saying they were content with her arrest, but still needed to go after other people involved in the murder plot. Martínez' family also said they were shocked by the arrest, saying they hoped it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> and {{that they did not know}} the Fischers or Cisneros. On April 13, Cisneros was released from prison on a $300,000 bond, refusing to comment as she left. According to court documents, Cisneros did not go before a judge to obtain a bond. Her attorney reached an agreement with the Cameron County Court District after her bond was denied the week before. Martínez remained in prison, and her bond was set at the same amount the next day. Her lawyer stated that she deserved a bond as well because she was a senior citizen and had a clean criminal record.|$|E

He returned to his regular racquet {{for the second half}} of the season. After Wimbledon, Federer continued to be upset early in tournaments in Hamburg and Gstaad because of a serious back injury through October, when he announced that he was parting ways with Paul Annacone, his coach for the last three years. Federer made the final in Basel, succumbing to Juan Martín del Potro in three sets, and indicated it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> to have played certain tournaments while suffering from a back injury.|$|E
5|$|Father McCue (Arnie Walters) {{contacts}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and asks}} for her help in the case. Scully visits the Kernofs, and learns that Dara was adopted six years earlier. Due to her severe spinal deformities, there is no explanation as to how Dara {{walked out of the}} house. Lance is convinced that it was the Devil that stood over her in the street. Scully examines Dara's body with a pathologist Vicki Belon (Lorraine Landry), who notes her surgically removed extra fingers. Belon reluctantly proposes that the girl was struck down by God, as if she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b>|$|E
5|$|In April 1996, after {{continued}} Hezbollah rocket {{attacks on}} Israeli civilians, the Israeli armed forces launched Operation Grapes of Wrath, which {{was intended to}} wipe out Hezbollah's base in southern Lebanon. Over 100 Lebanese refugees {{were killed by the}} shelling of a UN base at Qana, in what the Israeli military said <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> Finally, following several days of negotiations, the two sides signed the Grapes of Wrath Understandings on 26 April 1996. A cease-fire was agreed upon between Israel and Hezbollah, which would be effective on 27 April 1996. Both sides agreed that civilians should not be targeted, which meant that Hezbollah would be allowed to continue its military activities against IDF forces inside Lebanon.|$|E

Solo {{said in a statement}} she had been prescribed a pre-menstrual medication and was not aware it contained any banned substances. She cooperated with the USADA and provided them with the necessary information to prove that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> Her story checked out and she was cleared with a public warning. The positive test did not require Solo to withdraw from any pre-Olympic matches.|$|E
5|$|Michael takes relish {{in being}} able to freely {{proclaim}} his relationship with Jan to his bosses, making Jan uncomfortable. She eventually pulls him aside and tries to get him to have sex with her in the bathroom. Michael refuses and she becomes angry. As they drive home together, Jan hypothesizes that she only enjoyed being with Michael because their relationship was undisclosed and therefore unethical, and that disclosing it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake.</b> Michael is hurt and upset at this, and Jan takes back her comments to keep him from crying.|$|E

Holly feels out of her depth as a teacher, having enabled Mercedes' behavior.

Terri arrives while they are talking and is angered by Holly's presence. Will asks her to leave, telling her that their reunion <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and concluding their relationship for good.|$|E

5|$|Written by Mike Tucker & Robert Perry, {{this was}} a three-part Cybermen story set in war-torn London of the 1940s. They had {{completed}} the first two episodes in script form and the final episode as a storyline, and were planning to submit it during the start of production on season 26. Fellow writer Ben Aaronovitch intercepted the script, suggesting that submitting to script editor Andrew Cartmel a World War II script when he was currently already editing something similar (The Curse of Fenric) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and to instead submit it for the following series. Tucker & Perry later adapted the story as a novel for the BBC Past Doctors range in October 1997.|$|E
5|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the game is}} heroism, where being a hero may bring more harm than help. During development, there was a point at the {{beginning}} of the game where players could choose to leave Dubai. This was cut from the game, as the team found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in the game. According to Williams, the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload the game and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that it might make the game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E
5|$|At the department, with April {{absent from}} work, Ron asks Andy {{to fill in}} as an {{assistant}} because the anti-government oriented Ron believes Andy will be ineffective.

Although initially not wishing to get involved, Ron reluctantly tells Andy she is at the hospital and he should visit her. Meanwhile, Ann remains pleasant throughout her nursing shift despite April's constant abuse. The second her shift ends, however, Ann immediately loses her temper and curses at April. Ann apologizes for kissing Andy, but insists it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> and that April should stop taking it out on Andy. Later, Andy visits April, who pretends to be asleep but smiles, revealing she is happy he came.|$|E
