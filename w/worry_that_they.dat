25|$|There {{were some}} {{problems}} in Yggdra Union's development. One such situation was a <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{would not be}} able to fit all of the data onto the cartridge, but Sting okayed the release of the game on a larger cartridge, alleviating any space problems. The largest problem was character design. Many different character designs were produced, but the creators of the game had difficulty agreeing on which ones to use.|$|E
25|$|There also {{exists a}} strong urge and need in {{preserving}} the many dialects existing Singapore. The {{decline of the}} Chinese indigenous religion, Taoism, has also indirectly contributed to the deterioration of Chinese cultural heritage. Unless the government and Chinese Singaporeans take their own initiative in preserving non-Mandarin varieties, there is <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may disappear from Singapore in the near future. There is thus {{a strong desire to}} restore the Chinese identity or risk it falling into extinction one day. This exigency is translated into recent renewed efforts by Chinese clan associations in Singapore to impart and revive their respective Chinese mother tongues, which are met with warm receptions, including by the younger generations. Therefore, there lies a greater challenge for the Chinese community in Singapore – the preservation of the Chinese identity – than just the satisfaction of linguistic domination and material gains.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of July 1, 1872 the leaders of strike {{assembled}} {{in front of the}} Lycoming County Courthouse. They then marched to each sawmill and gathered the mill workers and/or shutdown the machinery of the mill. The strike on July 1 was relatively peaceful. The leaders of the strike became worried that the lumbermen would return to work without gaining the new working hours and higher pay that they sought. Many of the mill workers expressed <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be unable to feed their families if they did not earn their wages by working. The leaders of the strike assembled once again on July 22 and they descended on the mills once again. This time they were met by a police force that was ordered to prevent the mills from being closed down. The strikers attempted to force their way past the police force. They threw stones at the police and the mill and the riot began. Many of the strikers armed themselves with clubs and revolvers. They chased away mill workers and tried to chase away the police.|$|E

500|$|The euro fell {{against the}} US dollar {{for the two}} trading days {{preceding}} the vote on speculation that a win for the True Finns would hinder the prospects for the Portuguese bailout. Questions were raised whether {{the fall of the}} US dollar to a one-year low could be stemmed. The questions were partially answered on the last trading day before the election, when the dollar rose on concern for a shake-up for European confidence {{as a result of the}} election which caused bearish traders to cover their open positions. The strong showing by the True Finns and the Social Democrats caused EU leaders to <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may not be able to count on Finland's future support for any such bailout measure. Concerns for the euro grew in the run-up to the election and caused worry after the result. Eurozone stock markets were also upset and could be further upset as the bailout talks, expected to be concluded in mid-May, were affected. While there was no expectation that the bailout wound be derailed, [...] "caution" [...] was said to be the [...] "watchword." [...] The London Stock Exchange also considered the result a possible obstruction to the bailout.|$|E
500|$|When the Persians arrived off {{the coast}} of Lade and learned the number of Ionian ships, they began to <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{would not be able to}} defeat the Greeks, and feared Darius's wrath should they fail. The Ionian tyrants who had been {{expelled}} at the beginning of the revolt were present, and according to Herodotus, they were now given instructions by the Persians: [...] "Men of Ionia, let each one of you now show that he has done good service to the king's house; let each one of you try to separate your own countrymen from the rest of the allied power. Set this promise before them: they will suffer no harm for their rebellion, neither their temples nor their houses will be burnt, nor will they in any way be treated more violently than before. But if they will not do so and are set on fighting, then utter a threat that will restrain them: if they are defeated in battle, they will be enslaved; we will make eunuchs of their boys, and carry their maidens captive to Bactra, and hand over their land to others." [...] The tyrants thus sent messages to their own kinsman, but the Ionians refused the offers. Critically, each group thought that only they had been approached—there does not seem to have been any discussion of this offer between the different contingents, and the possibility for treachery does not seem to have been realised.|$|E
