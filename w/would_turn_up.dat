5|$|Swannell {{played as}} a forward, {{and in his}} last Test {{specifically}} at number eight. He was an unconventional and hard rugby player, known for his violent play. He <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> for training in unwashed kit, and wore the same pair of breeches for every game, again unwashed. His poor personal hygiene and overly violent playing style, made him an unpopular character {{in the eyes of}} other players.|$|E
5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E

25|$|Paul Georgescu died in October 1989, {{some two}} months before the Romanian Revolution toppled communism. He was buried on the {{outskirts}} of Bucharest, at the cemetery in Străuleşti. According to writer Bedros Horasangian, the funeral ceremony was interrupted in the hope that more people <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up.</b> Columnist and literary historian Nicolae Manolescu signed Georgescu's obituary in România Literară, voicing a call for moderation in assessing his colleague's career. A final volume of the Huzurei series, titled Între timp ("Meanwhile"), was published posthumously in 1990.|$|E
25|$|The global American and European weather models {{encountered}} exceptional {{difficulty in}} portraying {{the path of}} the storm. The main issue that the models were trying to resolve was whether or not the upper-level low pressure system from Central Canada was going to phase in time with the southern stream energy, thereby revealing if the resulting storm would come up the Eastern Seaboard or simply continue to move east out to sea in the Atlantic Ocean. The latter solution would have only caused the storm to affect the Mid-Atlantic states of Virginia and North Carolina with a modest winter storm instead of the entire Eastern coastline up to Atlantic Canada. As such, it was only 24 hours prior to the storm's arrival in the Northeastern states when all the European and American models were in agreement that the storm <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> the entire coastline. The National Weather Service's Hydrometeorological Prediction Center and many other private forecasters were skeptical of the storm impacting the Northeastern states until about 24 hours of the storm's arrival as well; although, some models depicted the storm delivering a full-blown blizzard to the New York City metropolitan area as early as a week in advance. The Hydrometeorological Prediction Center even issued a statement on Christmas Eve, 48 hours prior to the storm, that they suspected the American models of having model initialization errors; thus, they believed these errors may have forced the storm to be erroneously modeled to come up the Northeastern coast.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, {{scientists}} from the State University of New York at Stony Brook and the University of Antananarivo began the Mahajanga Basin Project, a series of expeditions to examine the fossils and geology of the Late Cretaceous sediments {{near the village of}} Berivotra, in Mahajanga Province. Among these scientists was paleontologist David W. Krause of Stony Brook. [...] The first expedition turned up hundreds of theropod teeth identical to those of Majungasaurus, some of which were attached to an isolated premaxilla that was described in 1996. The following seven expeditions <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> tens of thousands of fossils, many of which belonged to species new to science. The Mahajanga Basin Project claims credit for quintupling the known diversity of fossil taxa in the region.|$|E

500|$|Princess Caroline's {{unconventional}} behaviour led, in 1807, to {{accusations that}} she had had sexual relations with other men since the separation. [...] Caroline was caring for a young child, William Austin, who was alleged to be her child by another man. [...] The Prince of Wales hoped that what was termed [...] "the Delicate Investigation" [...] <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> evidence of adultery that would permit him to get a divorce, and forbade Charlotte to see her mother. Charlotte was aware of the investigation. [...] The ten-year-old was deeply hurt when mother and daughter caught sight of each other in the park, and Caroline, obedient to the Prince's command to have no contact with Charlotte, pretended not to see her. [...] To George's bitter disappointment, the investigating committee found no evidence Caroline had had a second child, though it noted that the Princess's behaviour was very much open to misconstruction. [...] The King, who was fond of Caroline, had refused to see her during the investigation, but began to receive her again afterwards. [...] After the conclusion of the Delicate Investigation, the Prince reluctantly allowed Charlotte to see her mother again, with the condition that William Austin not be a playmate.|$|E
500|$|The Black Crowes {{played a}} few {{shows in the}} eastern US in early January before the release of By Your Side, then {{spent the rest of}} the month {{promoting}} the album via television appearances in the US, Canada and Europe. [...] A brief warm-up show in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on February10 preceded a two-month tour of North American theaters, called the Souled Out Tour, with Moke as the opening band. [...] Every song from By Your Side was played at some point on this tour – [...] "Go Faster", [...] "Kickin' My Heart Around", [...] "By Your Side" [...] and [...] "Virtue and Vice" [...] were performed at most shows, but [...] "Diamond Ring" [...] was played only twice. [...] A 1963 Fender Esquire guitar belonging to Rich was stolen from the backstage area at DeVos Performance Hall in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on February16. [...] The band's management waited six weeks before issuing a press release asking for its return, hoping the guitar <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> in a local pawnshop. No update on the guitar was ever provided. [...] After taking two weeks off, the band spent six weeks playing outdoor amphitheaters in the US on a co-headlining tour with Lenny Kravitz; opening acts were Everlast and Cree Summer.|$|E
500|$|... "The Xindi" [...] {{was seen}} as a new pilot by {{executive}} producers Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, who also wrote the episode. Braga said [...] "We were re-establishing an Enterprise {{that was going to be}} a little bit different this year, so we had to think of it in those terms." [...] They felt the best way to do this was to immediately reveal the Xindi to the audience, and to give the MACOs something to do in order to introduce them as well. He called it a [...] "big episode" [...] as they sought to set up the rest of season. The shoot began on June 26, 2003, with the expectation that it would take nine days (as opposed to the usual seven) to complete. One of the special effects on the episode used ground Styrofoam which had been painted blue and processed through a wood chipper. It was used to represent the mineral Trellium-D within the mine. However, the ground Styrofoam stuck to the actors' shoes and costumes and ended up being spread throughout the Paramount lot where the series was filmed. It <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> in unexpected places on set for the rest of the series, and was found in among the sets as they were being dismantled after the end of [...]|$|E

500|$|The {{term was}} {{originally}} coined as [...] "Hoorah Henry" [...] in 1936 by American author Damon Runyon in his short story [...] "Tight Shoes". Runyon used it when describing his character Calvin Colby, a rich layabout, saying, [...] "He is without strict doubt a Hoorah Henry, {{and he is}} generally figured as nothing but a lob as far as doing anything useful in this world is concerned". Albert Jack challenges the idea that Runyon made the term popular, crediting Jim Godbolt with the correct explanation of its popularity. Godbolt remembers that in 1951 {{it was used to}} refer to the fans of Old Etonian jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton who <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> in droves to the 100 Club in Oxford Street, London and shout in loud, upper class voices between songs, [...] "Hooray!, Hooray!". Lyttelton himself has commented on the term but credits Runyon with coining it; he once stated in an interview, [...] "In jazz circles, aggressively [...] "upper class" [...] characters are known as Hoorays, an adaption, I believe, of Damon Runyon's [...] "Hooray Henries". For the English language specialist David Crystal, the term is usually given to the [...] "loud-mouthed ineffectual upper class twit". He explains that it began appearing in British literature in the 1950s, although the Americans then [...] "seemed to lose track of the term". As a result, it was often included in British English guides in order to assist Americans. By the 1960s, the term was likened to Sloane Rangers, a term later applied to women such as Lady Diana Spencer before she married Prince Charles.|$|E
500|$|Popular was {{uncertain}} {{of the sales}} potential for the two new titles and decided to publish them under its Fictioneers imprint, which was used for lower-paying magazines. Astonishings first issue was dated February 1940; it was bimonthly, alternating monthly with Super Science Stories. [...] Pohl's budget for an issue was $405: in Pohl's memoirs he recalls Harry Steeger, {{one of the company}} owners, breaking down the budget for him: [...] "Two hundred seventy-five dollars for stories. [...] A hundred dollars for black and white art. Thirty dollars for a cover." [...] Pohl could only offer half a cent per word for fiction, well below the rates offered by the leading magazines. [...] At ten cents, the magazine was cheaper {{than any of the other}} sf magazines of the day, and it sold well, despite Pohl's limited resources. [...] It was certainly assisted by Popular's wide and effective distribution network, and the publisher soon increased Pohl's budget, to pay bonuses for popular stories. [...] Pohl later commented that he {{was uncertain}} whether the additional funds really helped to bring in higher quality submissions, although at the time he assured Steeger it would improve the magazine. [...] Some of the additional money went to long-time writer Ray Cummings, who was sufficiently well known that the young Pohl felt unable to reject his stories, even though he disliked his work. [...] Cummings came to see Pohl in person to submit his work, and refused to sell for less than one cent a word; since the first visit came on a day when Pohl had some extra money available, Pohl was never able to bring himself to tell Cummings that he could not really afford to pay that rate. [...] Pohl comments in his memoirs that [...] "for months he <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> regularly as clockwork and sell me a new story; I hated them all, and bought them all." ...|$|E

2500|$|Coll {{agreed to}} murder Luciano for a $25,000 {{payment in advance}} and a $25,000 payment on {{completion}} of the job. On September 10, 1931, Maranzano invited Luciano to visit his office.

However, Luciano had received a tip-off about this plan (although probably not {{the identity of the}} hitman), so he instead sent over a squad of his own hitmen who stabbed and shot Maranzano to death. According to the 1963 testimony of government witness Joseph Valachi, Coll arrived at the office to kill Luciano, only to meet Luciano's hitmen fleeing the scene. [...] After learning from them that Maranzano was dead, Coll immediately left the building, $25,000 richer.|$|E

[...] Andrew Winistorfer of Prefix Magazine: [...] "a milquetoast selection of mid-tempo stadium anthems," [...] though he found some positivity in [...] "Golden Web", and claimed that {{the high point of}} the album was the soaring chorus of [...] "Digital Hearts". He ended by retorting: [...] "a featureless product that neglects the band’s distinct former character." [...] Corban Goble of Adequacy, had good things to say about the instrumentation and commented that the record had a great feel, though he felt that the album was missing any kind of strong hook or melody, and that the band lacked passion.|$|E
