5000|$|Before {{and during}} 1937, two paint companies, Kay & Ess and Chadeloid Chemical Co., were in patent {{litigation}} with each other. Each company claimed that it controlled the basic patents on <b>wrinkle</b> <b>finish,</b> and each company {{contended that the}} patents of the other {{could not be used}} without infringing its own patents. In November 1937 they decided to settle the litigation by forming a new, jointly-owned company, New Wrinkle, to which they assigned their patents. They agreed that they would license the wrinkle-finish industry to make and sell at fixed prices. Kay & Ess and Chadeloid then worked together to induce all manufacturers of <b>wrinkle</b> <b>finish</b> products to accept the price-fixing patent licenses from New Wrinkle. The prospective licensees were assured that the other manufacturers were being dealt with on the same basis [...] "in order to establish minimum prices throughout the industry." [...] By September 1938 the leading manufacturing companies and some 200 other manufacturers—substantially all manufacturers of wrinkle finishes in the United States—held nearly identical ten-year extendable license agreements from New Wrinkle, fixing prices. These license agreements required that a licensee observe in all sales of products covered by the licensed patents a schedule of minimum prices, discounts, and selling terms. Unlike its organizers, Kay & Ess and Chadeloid, New Wrinkle does not manufacture and sell the patented products. It just owns and licenses the patents.|$|E
5000|$|United States v. New Wrinkle, Inc., 342 U.S. 371 (1952), is a 1952 Supreme Court {{decision}} {{in which the}} Court held that a claim of conspiracy to fix uniform minimum prices and to eliminate competition throughout substantially all of the <b>wrinkle</b> <b>finish</b> industry of the United States by means of patent license agreements was, if proved, a violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act. That one of the defendants, a patent-holding company, abstained from manufacturing activities, did not ship goods in commerce, and engaged solely in patent licensing did not insulate its activity from § 1. Making these license contracts {{for the purpose of}} regulating distribution and fixing prices of commodities in interstate commerce is subject to the Sherman Act, even though the isolated act of contracting for the licenses occurs within a single state. Patents give no protection from the prohibitions of the Sherman Act when the patent licensing agreements are used to restrain interstate commerce and fix prices of goods shipped in commerce.|$|E
50|$|To equip US Army Air Corps planes, the US Army {{adopted in}} 1941 a reduced set of radios from the ARA/ATA range. Designated SCR-274-N, these Army radios were {{electrically}} {{almost identical to}} their ARA/ATA counterparts, except for receiver output and modulator sidetone audio transformer output impedance. Structurally and in appearance, they were virtually identical except for most later units being left unpainted aluminum {{in contrast to the}} black <b>wrinkle</b> <b>finish</b> of the Navy sets. The designation SCR-274-N is a pre-World War II Army equipment nomenclature. The Army never acquired the ARA 1.5 to 3.0 MHz receiver, nor the ATA 2.1 to 3.0 MHz transmitter. Initially, it did not acquire the 3.0 to 4.0 MHz transmitter, nor the 0.52 to 1.5 MHz receiver, but the need to communicate on the common civil airfield frequency of 3.105 MHz plus the anticipated USAAF use of the AN/ARR-1 homing adapter (see below) compelled adding these units to the SCR-274-N. Early Army units were made by Aircraft Radio Corporation, but the vast majority was made by Western Electric, plus a few by Colonial Radio and others.|$|E
5000|$|Tung oil or China {{wood oil}} is a drying oil {{obtained}} by pressing the seed from the nut of the tung tree (Vernicia fordii). Tung oil hardens upon exposure to air, {{and the resulting}} coating is transparent and has a deep, almost wet look. Used mostly for finishing/protecting wood, after numerous coats the finish can even look plastic-like. Related drying oils include linseed, safflower, poppy and soybean oils. The oil and its use {{are believed to have}} originated in ancient China and appear in the writings of Confucius from about 400 B.C.Raw tung oil tends to dry to a fine wrinkled finish; the US name for this is gas checking: this property was used to make <b>wrinkle</b> <b>finishes,</b> usually by adding excess cobalt drier. To stop this, the oil is heated to gas-proof it, and most oils used for coating are gas-proofed. Thus, to avoid the wrinkling, all tung oil available for finishing today is [...] "boiled".|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Resin or <b>wrinkle</b> free <b>finishing</b> {{is widely}} used in the textile {{industry}} to impart wrinkle-resistance to cotton fabrics and garments. Considerable loss in strength of the finished fabrics {{has been a major}} concern for the industry. The overall objectives of this work are to investigate the effect of resin <b>finish</b> on <b>wrinkle</b> recovery, tensile strength, bending length & DP ratings of cotton and cotton blended fabrics. However the changes due to crease resist finish are found to be statistically significant. In addition, the wrinkle recovery angle increases approximately 42 %, breaking strength reduces about 64 %, Stiffness increases 8 % after the crease resistant finishing. To find out the varieties of cotton blended fabrics in order to develop market viable new products is also another purpose of this project.

40|$|There {{are five}} low-stress {{mechanical}} properties (tensile, shearing, bending, surface, and compression) {{that affect the}} fabric handle. Dimethyloldihydroxyethyleneurea (DMDHEU) is a conventional agent for imparting wrinkle-resistant properties to cotton fabric. DMDHEU-crosslinked fabrics provide excellent wrinkle recovery properties but may affect the fabric hand. In this study, fabrics treated for wrinkle resistance were assessed by the Kawabata Evaluation System for Fabric (KES-F), which objectively evaluates low-stress mechanical properties of textiles. Four curing temperatures, 110, 130, 150, and 170 ºC, {{were used in the}} <b>wrinkle</b> resistant <b>finishing</b> and effects of different concentrations of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) used as co-catalyst were also studied. It was found that changes in curing temperature (from 110 to 170 ºC) have an obvious effect on tensile, shearing and bending properties. Surface and compression properties, however, did not show a significant variation. Moreover, the use of TiO 2 particles in the treatment affected low-stress mechanical properties of fabrics to a certain extent, especially in compression properties, due to the increase in thickness.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} awareness of environmental pollution and the extensive 	consideration of mankind health, {{there has been}} an increased demand for natural fibers 	in textile materials recently. As a typical natural fiber, ramie is an increasingly popular 	because of its excellent properties including a high tensile strength, excellent thermal 	conductivity, coolness, ventilation function, moisture absorption, and antibacterial 	function. However, ramie fiber and ramie fabric have some disadvantages such as poor 	elasticity, low wrinkle recovery, low resilience, itchiness, harsh handle, which decreases 	the competitiveness of ramie fabric in the high-grade garment-fabric market. It is 	necessary to use the advanced technologies in the dyeing and finishing for enhancing 	the competitiveness of ramie fabric. This study is aimed to study the natural dyeing and 	functional finishing of ramie fabric. At present, ramie fabrics are mostly dyed with synthetic colorants which can give rise 	to serious environmental pollution and potential harm to mankind health. Thus the 	natural and healthy features of ramie fabric are greatly weakened. In this study, ramie 	fabrics were dyed with the several natural extracts. But heavy metal ions, which lead to 	environmental pollution, are usually used as mordant in natural dyeing. In this study, the 	eco-friendly rare earth was used as mordant in natural dyeing of ramie fabrics. The 	influences of dyeing conditions were studied. The ramie fabrics dyed using rare earth as 	mordant exhibited higher color shade stability against pH variation. Using rare earth as 	mordant in natural dyeing apparently enhanced the color fastness to washing, rubbing 	and light of the ramie fabrics. As compared with Fe 2 + and Cr 6 +, rare earth was more 	efficient, resulting in decrease of mordant concentration in natural dyeing. Thus rare 	earth was effective mordant in the natural dyeing of ramie fabrics. One of the shortcomings of ramie fabric is its lower wrinkle recovery. The typical 	<b>wrinkle</b> resistant <b>finishing</b> via cross-linking usually decreases strength of cellulose 	fabrics. In this study, ramie fabrics were pretreated with liquid ammonia (NH 3) prior to 	<b>wrinkle</b> resistant <b>finishing.</b> Meanwhile, a kind of thermally reactive polyurethane (PU) 	emulsion was used as strength protector. The liquid NH 3 pretreatment was proved todecrease crystallinity of ramie fiber and bring about apparent swelling effect. As a result, 	the accessibility of the ramie fabrics treated by liquid NH 3 was elevated. The liquid NH 3 	pretreatment prior to resin finishing gave rise to better wrinkle resistant effect and less 	strength loss. The thermally reactive PU emulsion was proved to decrease strength loss 	of ramie fabric without influencing wrinkle resistant effect. Using liquid NH 3 	pretreatment and employing reactive PU as protector in the <b>wrinkle</b> resistant <b>finishing</b> 	of ramie fabric can raise strength retention up to 80 %. After 10 laundry cycles, the flat 	appearance and the crease retention of these ramie fabrics were over grade 3. 0. Developing electromagnetic shielding textiles has drawn increasing attention recently 	since electromagnetic pollution is harmful to mankind health. In this study, super critical 	carbon dioxide (scCO 2) fluid technology was used to develop electromagnetic shielding 	ramie fabric. The scCO 2 treatment could remove the impurities of the ramie fibers 	prominently. The scCO 2 fluid could result in the swelling of ramie fiber and thus 	increase the absorbency of ramie fiber to additives. Using scCO 2 fluid, the Palladium 	(II) -hexafluoroacetylacetonate could be impregnated into the ramie fiber under 	appropriate conditions. After thermal decomposition at high temperature, the Palladium 	film formed on ramie fibers. The ramie fabrics bearing Palladium catalyst were plated 	with a cooper film via electroless cooper plating. The cooper coated ramie fabrics 	exhibited good shielding effect. This study presented a new way for developing 	electromagnetic shielding fabric. Nanoparticles have been extensively used for the functional finishing of textiles. But 	the nano finishing of ramie fabrics has less been studied. In this study, the 	multifunctional ramie fabrics coated by TiO 2 nanoparticle were developed. The optimal 	dispersion conditions of TiO 2 nanoparticles in aqueous suspension were studied in 	details. A kind of hydrophilic silica aerogel product was proved to be suitable for 	serving as dispersant for dispersion of TiO 2. Using the TiO 2 suspension prepared in 	optimal conditions, ramie fabrics were coated with TiO 2 via a dip-pad-dry process. In 	order to enhance the finishing durability the ramie fabric were pretreated by citric acid 	prior to nano finishing. The ramie fabric finished with working bath containing 0. 8 g/L 	TiO 2 was proved exhibited excellent UV protection and antibacterial property, and high capability for decomposing formaldehyde. Treating fabric with citric acid before coating 	could improve the washing durability of the resultant TiO 2 loaded ramie fabrics. This study explored several ways for developing healthy and highly functional ramie 	fabrics with high added value. The resultant ramie fabrics exhibited high quality. The 	newly developed dyeing and finishing processes are supposed to be helpful for raising 	the competitiveness of ramie and expanding its application...|$|R
