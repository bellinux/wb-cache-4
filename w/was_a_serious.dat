5|$|A {{declared}} {{purpose of}} the Treaty of the Triple Alliance was the demolition of the Humaitá fortifications and that none others of that sort should be built again. However the fortress, though not by then invulnerable to the latest armour-plated warships, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> obstacle to the Allies’ plans to proceed upriver to the Paraguayan capital Asunción and to recapture the Brazilian territory of Mato Grosso: it delayed them {{for two and a}} half years. It was taken in the Siege of Humaitá (1868), then razed pursuant to the Treaty.|$|E
50|$|What is {{considered}} serious varies widely across cultures and is studied in sociology, cultural anthropology, and criminology; {{being of the}} wrong religious faith may <b>be</b> considered <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> crime in some cultures; smoking marijuana may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> crime in some cultures and not others; homosexuality <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> crime in some cultures; and prostitution <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> crime in some cultures. Perception of seriousness is measured in assessing varying cultural perceptions on health risks.|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} discovery Wigner {{made during}} the project was the Wigner effect. This is a swelling of the graphite moderator caused by the displacement of atoms by neutron radiation. The Wigner effect <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> problem for the reactors at the Hanford Site in the immediate post-war period, and resulted in production cutbacks and a reactor being shut down entirely. It was eventually discovered {{that it could be}} overcome by controlled heating and annealing.|$|E
5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from the roof and from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E
5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> {{allegation}} to make {{against a}} physician.

5|$|Rothman showed Linnaeus that botany <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> subject. He taught Linnaeus to {{classify}} plants according to Tournefort's system. Linnaeus was also taught about the sexual reproduction of plants, according to Sébastien Vaillant. In 1727, Linnaeus, age 21, enrolled in Lund University in Skåne. He was registered as , the Latin form of his full name, which he also used later for his Latin publications.|$|E
5|$|The armor {{scheme of}} the Gangut-class ships had some {{significant}} weaknesses. The rear transverse bulkhead was unprotected {{by any other}} armor but was the same thickness as the forward bulkhead which was defended by the upper belt armor. The thinness of the barbette armor <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> defect which could have proved fatal in a battle. And {{the lack of a}} splinter bulkhead behind the armor of the turrets, barbettes and conning towers left all of those locations vulnerable to main gun hits. But the biggest weakness was the lack of an anti-torpedo bulkhead, which made them highly vulnerable to mines or torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{was very}} close to his younger sister, Princess Helen, Alexander was less warm towards his elder brother George, with whom he had little in common. While his elder brother <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> and {{thoughtful}} child, Alexander was mischievous and extroverted; he smoked cigarettes made from blotting paper, set fire to the games room in the palace, and recklessly lost control of a toy cart in which he and his younger brother Paul were rolling down a hill, tipping his toddler brother a distance of six feet into brambles.|$|E

5|$|Although airpower {{was to be}} a {{major factor}} in the defense of Lima Site 85, it could not be applied without {{limitations}} and restrictions. The defense of Lima Site 85 was not the sole focus of limited air resources at the time. During this period, the 1968 Tet Offensive was underway in South Vietnam, the Marine outpost at Khe Sanh was under siege, and there existed an unprecedented flow of enemy logistical traffic which had to be interdicted. Lima Site 85 had provided direction to about a quarter of the USAF missions over North Vietnam and Barrel Roll from November1967 to 11March1968. No other facility existed to provide a similar coverage over these areas. While this loss <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> blow to the USAF air effort, it was not crippling.|$|E
5|$|Batavian {{control of}} the Dutch Cape Colony <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> risk to British {{shipping}} rounding the Cape of Good Hope, and a substantial force under Sir George Keith Elphinstone was sent from Britain to eliminate it. Arriving in early August, Elphinstone initially attempted to intimidate the governor into surrender, but eventually authorised a landing at Simon's Town. On 7 August the expeditionary force fought a skirmish at Muizenberg and clashes continued throughout August. A major Dutch attack on 3 September was forestalled {{by the arrival of}} a large fleet of Indiamen carrying British reinforcements, and as these troops came ashore the outnumbered Dutch surrendered. A much-delayed Batavian expeditionary force, sent to retake {{control of the}} Cape, arrived in August 1796, but was out-manoeuvered and forced to surrender by Elphinstone at the Capitulation of Saldanha Bay.|$|E
5|$|Buckingham Palace finally {{became the}} {{principal}} royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria, {{who was the}} first monarch to reside there; her predecessor WilliamIV had died before its completion. While the state rooms were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence. Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when it was decided to install gas lamps, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> worry about the build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty. Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, Prince Albert, concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace. The problems were all rectified by the close of 1840. However, the builders were to return within the decade.|$|E

5|$|During Muñoz Rivera's childhood, Barranquitas was a {{small rural}} town. The family's house was {{moderately}} large for the time; it was built with wood and its roof was made with zinc. When he was four, his mother home-schooled him with books from a private library owned by his father. By the age of ten, Muñoz Rivera completed the education offered in the town's school, and finished first in his class. He was educated in Spanish and French, and took music classes with Jorge Colombani. His father hired private tutors to continue his instruction. Muñoz Rivera <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> student with {{a strong interest in}} Miguel de Cervantes' works, in particular Don Quixote. Other authors that he studied include Fernando de Herrera, Tirso de Molina, Luis de Góngora, and Lope de Vega.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, {{sea otter}} numbers rebounded in {{about two-thirds of}} their {{historic}} range, a recovery {{considered one of the}} greatest successes in marine conservation. However, the IUCN still lists the sea otter as an endangered species, and describes the significant threats to sea otters as oil pollution, predation by orcas, poaching, and conflicts with fisheries– sea otters can drown if entangled in fishing gear. The hunting of sea otters is no longer legal except for limited harvests by indigenous peoples in the United States. Poaching <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> concern in the Russian Far East immediately {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union in 1991; however, it has declined significantly with stricter law enforcement and better economic conditions.|$|E
5|$|Financially the Militia was {{neglected}} also. Despite the upturn in {{the economic}} situation in the early 1930s there was little financial respite for the Militia in this time. As the situation continued to improve, however, the defence vote was increased steadily after 1935. Indeed, in 1938 the government decided to double {{the strength of the}} Militia as war clouds began to loom on the horizon, and late in the year a recruiting campaign was launched that saw the size of the Militia increase from 35,000 to 43,000 men over the space of three months. This trend continued into 1939 and by midway through the year there were over 80,000 men serving on a part-time voluntary basis. Nevertheless, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> shortage of equipment and as a result, when World War II broke out in September 1939 the Militia was by no means an effective fighting force and {{the nation as a whole}} was not as well prepared for war as it had been in 1914.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{interest}} in the 1886 season concerned the newly inaugurated Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in July, which offered a then record prize of £10,000. From {{the start of the}} year, St. Gatien was seen as one of the leading contenders for the new race together with Bendigo and Minting. For the second year in succession, St. Gatien's spring preparation was disrupted, this time by injury, although he was able to resume his training in time for Royal Ascot. It was reported that St. Gatien had been defeated by Melton in a private trial race in early 1886, but there are few details and it is unclear whether or not this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> contest.|$|E
5|$|Others like Stroud, Krause and Phillips opine {{that even}} Rommel's {{recklessness}} and disobedience during {{the invasion of}} France benefitted the German cause, while rescuing Hitler's mercurial objectives and inventing the actual application of blitzkrieg ("lightning war"), and it was Hitler who downgraded strategic victory to operational victory. According to Alan J. Levine, contrary to the allegation {{that he was only}} a genius tactician without a good grasp of logistics, Rommel was a clearer thinker than most of his colleagues (shown by his judgements on developing situations), and although he was the most defeatist German general, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> qualification to his pessimism and he was capable of displaying a surprising amount of energy in building the Normandy defense at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Smetana {{did not act}} {{immediately}} on this aspiration. The announcement that a Provisional Theatre was to be opened in Prague, as a home for Czech opera and drama pending {{the building of a}} permanent National Theatre, influenced his decision to return permanently to his homeland in 1861. He was then spurred to creative action by the announcement of a prize competition, sponsored by the Czech patriot Jan von Harrach, to provide suitable operas for the Provisional Theatre. By 1863 he had written The Brandenburgers in Bohemia to a libretto by the Czech nationalist poet Karel Sabina, whom Smetana had met briefly in 1848. The Brandenburgers, which was awarded the opera prize, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> historical drama, but even before its completion Smetana was noting down themes for use in a future comic opera. By this time he had heard the music of Cornelius's Der Barbier, and was ready to try his own hand at the comic genre.|$|E
