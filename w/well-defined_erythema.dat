30|$|The albino Wistar rats were {{housed in}} cages, with free excess to {{standard}} laboratory diet and water. The dorsal abdominal {{skin of the}} rats was shaved carefully avoiding peripheral damage, before 24  h of conducting the study. Transdermal patch was applied onto the nude skin {{and covered with a}} non-sensitizing microporous tape. A 0.8 % v/v aqueous solution of formalin was applied as standard skin irritant. The animals were applied with new patch each day up to 7  days. The formulation was removed after 7  days; score of erythema was recorded and was compared with standard. The score of erythema was read and recorded by the Draize scoring method (Draize et al. 1944) as score 0 for no erythema, score 1 for very slight erythema (light pink), score 2 for <b>well-defined</b> <b>erythema</b> (dark pink), score 3 for moderate to severe erythema (light red), and score 4 for severe erythema (dark red).|$|E
