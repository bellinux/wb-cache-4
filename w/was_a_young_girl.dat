5|$|This episode {{originated}} as {{a script}} from freelance writer Scott Kaufer, {{who was an}} acquaintance of Chris Carter and former employee of California magazine and Warner Bros comedy development department. Chris Carter rewrote the script, which included the addition of Barnett's salamander hand. Fox's standards and practices department fought with the producers over the scene where Barnett strangles Reggie Purdue, {{and as a result}} the producers were forced to reduce the length of the scene. The footage of the young girl with progeria was filmed after the production crew contacted the Progeria Society and were put in touch with the family of Courtney Arciaga, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl</b> with the disease. She and her family were fans of the series, and were flown from their San Diego home to Vancouver to shoot the scene.|$|E

5|$|Kerrigan {{appears in}} several StarCraft novels that greatly expand her backstory {{before the first}} StarCraft game. The novel Uprising portrays Kerrigan's {{training}} as a Ghost assassin from an early age, where she is subjected to intense psychological abuse from her Confederate trainer, Lieutenant Rumm. When she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl,</b> an accident, most likely involving her powers, kills her mother and puts her father in a vegetative state. Consequently, Kerrigan is terrified to use her psionic abilities, and refuses Rumm's demands to show her power, even when he threatens to kill her father. Kerrigan is eventually subdued with mental implants and used as a top Confederate assassin until she is rescued by Arcturus Mengsk. The novels Liberty's Crusade and Queen of Blades provide novelisations for Kerrigan's actions in Episodes I and II of StarCraft respectively. Liberty's Crusade develops the implied relationship between Jim Raynor and Kerrigan, while Queen of Blades serves to demonstrate Kerrigan's complete transformation by the Zerg, her removal of her inhibitions and morality, {{and its effect on}} her former love, Raynor.|$|E

25|$|Bone-setting in the 18th {{century was}} often {{carried out by}} men, {{specifically}} farriers and blacksmiths, because it required a lot of strength. Mapp's career started out when she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl.</b> She served as the announcer at her father's booth during local races and fairs. When Mapp started helping her father's patients when he couldn't see them, she often performed amazing feats and treated them better than her father could. Mapp went on to start her own practice and her fame spread. Around 1735, Mapp's fame for fixing decade-old dislocations and fractures brought her to Epsom. Epsom was home to {{a large number of}} wealthy families and horse-racing, which provided Mapp with many patients. Even though Mapp had a limited knowledge of anatomy, she had the strength and innate talent for putting dislocations back into place.|$|E
25|$|Amrita Sher-Gil {{was born}} on 30 January 1913 in Budapest, Hungary, to Umrao Singh Sher-Gil Majithia, a Sikh aristocrat and a scholar in Sanskrit and Persian, and Marie Antoniette Gottesmann, a Hungarian-Jewish opera singer who came from an {{affluent}} bourgeois family. Her parents first met in 1912, while Marie Antoinette was visiting Lahore. Her mother came to India as a companion of Princess Bamba Sutherland, the granddaughter of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Sher-Gil was the elder of two daughters; her younger sister was Indira Sundaram (née Sher-Gil), born in March 1914), mother of the contemporary artist Vivan Sundaram. She spent most of early childhood in Budapest. She was the niece of Indologist Ervin Baktay. Baktay noticed Sher-Gil's artistic talents {{during his visit to}} Shimla in 1926 and was an advocate of Sher-Gil pursuing art. He guided her by critiquing her work and gave her an academic foundation to grow on. When she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl</b> she would paint the servants in her house, and get them to model for her. The memories of these models would eventually lead to her return to India. Her first teachers were Major Whitmarsh, who was later replaced by Beven Pateman.

25|$|In the Mahabharata, Durvasa {{is known}} for {{granting}} boons {{to those who had}} pleased him, particularly when he had been served well as an honoured guest. An example of such behaviour is the episode between him and Kunti, the future wife of Pandu and the mother of the Pandavas. When Kunti <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>girl,</b> she lived in the house of her adopted father, Kuntibhoja. Durvasa visited Kuntibhoja one day and sought his hospitality. The king entrusted the sage to his daughter's care and tasked Kunti with the responsibility of entertaining the sage and meeting all his needs during his stay with them. Kunti patiently put up with Durvasa's temper and his unreasonable requests (such as demanding food at odd hours of the night) and served the sage with great dedication. Eventually, the sage was gratified. Before departing, he rewarded Kunti by teaching her the Atharvaveda mantras, which enables a woman to invoke any god of her choice to beget children by them. Curious and skeptical, Kunti decided to test the mantra. After invoking Surya, the son god, she bore her first son, Karna. Fearing the fate of an unwed mother, she placed the newborn in a basket and set him afloat down a river. The infant Karna was later found and raised by Adhiratha, a charioteer for the monarch of Hastinapur, and his wife Radha. Soon after this episode, Kunti was married to Pandu, the king of Hastinapur, and, by invoking those same mantras taught to her by Durvasa, she bore the three eldest of Pandu's five sons. Karna would go on to become an accomplished warrior and a formidable adversary of the Pandavas. This enmity would eventually culminate in his death on the battlefield of Kurukshetra at the hands of Arjuna, his younger brother, who was unaware of their fraternal bond.|$|E
