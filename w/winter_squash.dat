The five domesticated species are Cucurbita argyrosperma, C.ficifolia, C.maxima, C.moschata, and C.pepo. All of these can be treated as <b>winter</b> <b>squash</b> because the full-grown fruits can be stored for months; however, C.pepo includes some cultivars that are better used only as summer squash.|$|E

Small-scale farm products of the town include potatoes and kabocha, a Japanese <b>winter</b> <b>squash.</b> Tourism is {{an important part of}} the economy of Shakotan, with most tourists visiting in the summer.

25|$|Kappa are {{not entirely}} {{antagonistic}} to human beings. They are curious about human civilization, and they can understand and speak Japanese. They may even befriend human beings in exchange for gifts or offerings of nasu (茄子, Japanese eggplant), soba (そば or 蕎麦, buckwheat noodles), nattō (なっとう or 納豆, fermented soybeans), or kabocha (カボチャ, 南瓜, <b>winter</b> <b>squash),</b> but especially cucumbers, the only food kappa are known to enjoy more than human children. Japanese parents sometimes write {{the names of their}} children, or their own names, on cucumbers and toss them into waters believed to be infested with kappa in order to mollify the creatures and allow the family to bathe. In some regions, it was customary to eat cucumbers before swimming as protection, but in others it was believed that this act would guarantee an attack. There is a cucumber-filled sushi roll known as kappamaki.|$|E

500|$|A {{system of}} {{companion}} planting called the Three Sisters {{was developed in}} North America.

40|$|Florida {{is ranked}} second nationally in the {{production}} of fresh market squash (2). ● Florida squash growers produce primarily summer squashes (Cucurbita pepo), such as crookneck squash, straightneck squash, scallop squash, and zucchini squash. Growers also produce some <b>winter</b> <b>squashes</b> (4), such as acorn (C. pepo), butternut squash (C. moschata), and spaghetti squash (C. pepo). There is some commercial production of calabaza or Cuban squash (Cucurbita moschata) in South Florida, and Floridians produce a variety of tropical squashes and related cucurbits [such as pumpkin (Cucurbita spp.), chayote (Sechium edule), banana squash (Cucurbita maxima), and gourds (Lagenaria spp. and Luffa spp.) ] in home gardens, but this profile includes only summer and <b>winter</b> <b>squashes</b> (12, 13, 14, 15, 16). ● Cash receipts for squash produced in Florida in 1999 - 2000, which totaled $ 45. 9 million, accounted for approximately 20 percent of the total U. S. cash receipts for squash production (2, 8). ● Of Florida's vegetable crops, squash is ranked 6 th in terms of harvested acres and 7 th in terms of total value (4). ● During the 1999 - 2000 crop year, Florida squash growers planted 12, 100 acres and harvested 11, 800 acres, producing a total of 3. 45 million bushels (145 million pounds).

Approximately 4, 000 acres were planted in Tennessee during 2001 and approximately 3, 500 acres were harvested.

40|$|There are {{at least}} three major species {{differences}} among the pumpkins and <b>winter</b> <b>squashes.</b> And, their response to herbicides differ, so {{it is important to know}} which types are sensitive to a particular herbicide to avoid crop injury. The major jack o’lantern pumpkin belongs to Cucurbita pepo (as does summer squash, acorn squash, and gourds), butternut wintersquash is a member of C. moschata, and the buttercups and hubbards belong to C. maxima. The primary preemergence herbicides used are Curbit, Command, Sandea, and Strategy. Curbit and Command control a number of broadleaves and grasses, and Sandea has both pre and postemergence activity on many broadleaves. Strategy, a premix of Curbit and Command, is labeled for all the vine crops, including jack-o-lanterns. All of the vine crops are somewhat sensitive to Sandea, so careful use is recommended.

50|$|In {{traditional}} European cuisine, nutmeg and mace {{are used}} especially in potato dishes and in processed meat products; {{they are also}} used in soups, sauces, and baked goods.

5000|$|Tromboncino (...) , {{also known}} as zucchetta (...) , {{is a type of}} squash most often used as a summer squash. While nearly all summer squash are {{cultivar}}s of Cucurbita pepo, tromboncino is a cultivar of Cucurbita moschata. The vining growth habit, is similar to many <b>winter</b> <b>squashes,</b> but unlike most other summer squash. It is more tolerant to some common summer squash pests, including squash vine borer, squash bugs, and powdery mildew, than the more commonly grown, bushy, C. pepo summer squash cultivars. The plants are slower to start producing than some C. pepo types. The fruit color is usually pale green, fading to beige upon maturity, and it is picked around one foot long for summer squash. It is an heirloom, originally from Liguria, and remains popular throughout Italy and abroad. Tromboncino squash can be left to mature into a winter squash; such is often compared to a watery butternut squash. If left to ripen, the fruits can grow over three feet in length.|$|R

Another aim was to determine whether coaches use the winter to concentrate and use compensation exercises. Methods: In my thesis I used a method of data collection, concretely document analysis and a public inquiry. Inquiry questions are divided into three groups: close questions (answers YES/NO), select from concrete answers and open answers. In document analysis are used multi media, virtual dates and objective dates. Results: I found out that most of squash instructors organize sports concentrations. Most of respondents prefer summer preparation to <b>winter</b> preparation. <b>Squash</b> instructors use compensational exercise regularly, but do not use supplemental sports very often. Winter sports use just about third of respondents. Some instructors forbid some sports. Especially it concerns tennis and badminton (because of the different struck technique).
