500|$|Hiddleston is {{well known}} for his {{portrayal}} of Loki in the 2011 Marvel Studios film, Thor. He was invited to audition by Kenneth Branagh, the film's director, after having previously worked with Branagh on Ivanov and Wallander. Hiddleston said of Branagh, [...] "Ken has had a life-changing effect. He was able to say to the executives, 'Trust me on this, you can cast Tom and he will deliver'. It was massive and it's completely changed the course of what is available to me to do. Ken gave me my break." [...] In the beginning, he originally auditioned for the part of Thor. [...] "I initially auditioned to play Thor. That <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being considered for, because I'm tall and blonde and classically trained, and that seemed to be the mold for what Thor was, he was to be a classical character. And it was in my auditions. I owe this entirely to Marvel and their open-mindedness, they saw something that they thought was interesting. They saw some temperament that they liked." [...] The casting director gave Hiddleston six weeks to bulk up, so he went on a strict diet and gained twenty pounds of muscle. In the end, Branagh decided he was more suitable as the antagonist and cast him as Loki.|$|E

In high school, Fortney was {{interested}} in baseball until the audience reaction he got playing John Mellencamp’s [...] "Small Town" [...] for the school talent show made an impression on him. Although he had played guitar for a while, he didn’t start writing music until he wrote a song for a friend’s funeral. He says of it, “That {{was the first time}} I ever put words and melody together. I realized in the future that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to be.” ...|$|E

His closest contact with a French Impressionist artist {{occurred}} when Hassam took over Renoir's former studio and found some of the painter's oil sketches left behind. [...] "I did not know anything about Renoir or care anything about Renoir.

2500|$|In 2009, Lords {{appeared}} in the direct-to-DVD science fiction movie, Princess of Mars, alongside Antonio Sabàto, Jr. She later regretted making the movie saying: [...] "Somewhere in my heart of hearts I was worried that I might be doing something wrong but I believed the voices of those around me who said 'No, it'll be artistic, no it'll be creative. You'll look beautiful. We have a very limited budget but honest, you'll be proud.' And it was bad, very bad. At least that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> told.

2500|$|... "If you flew wisely, the P-40 was a {{very capable}} aircraft. [...] could outturn a P-38, a fact that some pilots didn't realize when they made the {{transition}} between the two aircraft. [...] The real problem with it was lack of range. As we pushed the Japanese back, P-40 pilots were slowly {{left out of the}} war. So when I moved to P-38s, an excellent aircraft, I did not [...] that the P-40 was an inferior fighter, but because I knew the P-38 would allow us to reach the enemy. I was a fighter pilot and that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> supposed to do." [...] The 8th, 15th, 18th, 24th, 49th, 343rd and 347th PGs/FGs, flew P-40s in the Pacific theaters between 1941 and 1945, with most units converting to P-38s from 1943–44. In 1945, the 71st Reconnaissance Group employed them as armed forward air controllers during ground operations in the Philippines, until it received delivery of P-51s. They claimed 655 aerial victories.|$|E
2500|$|According to Weiner, {{he chose}} the 1960s because [...] "every time I would try and find {{something}} interesting that I wanted to do, it happened in 1960. It will blow your mind {{if you look at}} the year on the almanac. And it's not just the election [...] The pill came out in March 1960, that's really what I wanted it to be around.... That's the largest change in the entire world. Seriously, it's just astounding. Especially {{if you look at the}} movies from the 50s. Once it was acceptable to talk about this idea that teenagers were having sex, which they have been doing, obviously, since time immemorial, there were all these movies like Blue Denim, and Peyton Place ... he central tension in every movie that does not take place on the battlefield is about a girl getting pregnant. So all of a sudden that entire issue [...] has been removed from society. That <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> interested in in 1960." ...|$|E

2500|$|On D-Day, June 6, 1944, Schroeder was a 25-year-old {{captain in}} command of the 219men of Company F of the 2nd Battalion, 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division. The 8th Infantry Regiment was ordered to make the initial D-Day landing on Utah Beach as part of the invasion. [...] As they sailed to France from England on the night of June5 aboard the navy's USS Barnett on the rough English channel, they heard Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower's exhortation to the troops over the radio, [...] "Together, we shall achieve victory". Afterwards, the company commanders were summoned by the 2nd Battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Carlton MacNeely, to Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.'s {{quarters}} for a final briefing before the invasion. When the meeting ended near midnight, Schroeder later recounted, the officers [...] "wished each other well and shook hands", and MacNeely put his arm around Schroeder's shoulders. Addressing the young captain by his nickname, [...] "Moose", MacNeely said, [...] "Well, Moose, this is it. Give 'em hell!" [...] Schroeder said they both [...] "choked up" [...] and he replied, [...] "Well, colonel, I'll see you on the beach!" [...] Roosevelt said, [...] "Moose, take me in your boat when you go ashore". At 2:30a.m. on June 6, Schroeder's company left the Barnett to board their LCVP landing craft. Before departing the Barnett to face the enemy, Schroeder wrote a letter to his wife: [...] "I told her where I <b>was,</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> about to do, and how much I loved her".|$|E
