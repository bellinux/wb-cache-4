5|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of heliumII {{is greater than}} that of any other known substance, a million times that of heliumI and several hundred times that of copper. This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. HeliumII has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at 20 meters per second at 1.8K through heliumII as waves in a phenomenon known as second sound.|$|E
5|$|Thrombolysis is the {{administration}} of an enzyme (intravenous or directly into the affected vein through a catheter), which acts to enzymatically break up clots. This may {{reduce the risk of}} post-thrombotic syndrome by a third, and possibly reduce the risk of leg ulcers, but is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. The ACCP currently suggests anticoagulation rather than thrombolysis, but patients may choose thrombolysis if prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome outweighs concerns over the complexity, bleeding risk, and cost of the procedure. NICE recommends that thrombolysis is considered in those who have had symptoms for less than two weeks, are normally <b>well,</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good life expectancy and a low risk of bleeding.|$|E

25|$|Pitches in Australia have {{traditionally}} been known {{to be good for}} fast bowlers because of the amount of bounce that can be generated on these surfaces. In particular, the pitch at the WACA Ground in Perth is regarded as being possibly the quickest pitch in the world. The Gabba in Brisbane is also known to assist fast bowlers with its bounce. However, these kinds of bouncy pitches also open up more areas for run-scoring, as they promote the playing of a lot of pull, hook and cut shots.

Due to a failed weld, a steel cable snapped {{from a car}} being towed and hit the extra's car, damaging her skull. The extra, identified as Gabriela Cedillo, had to undergo brain surgery. The injury has left her permanently brain-damaged, paralyzed on her left side and her left eye stitched shut. Paramount admitted responsibility for the accident and covered all of Cedillo's medical costs. Nevertheless, Cedillo's family filed a lawsuit on October 5, citing seven counts of negligence against Paramount, and several other defendants (not including Bay), with total damages sought in excess of $350,000. Cedillo's attorney, Todd Smith, said, [...] "This was an attractive 24-year old girl who had dreams and aspirations involving acting, {{and this kind of}} injury may <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> serious impact on her dreams." [...] The filed complaint reads that [...] "Cedillo has endured and will in the future endure pain and suffering; has become disfigured and disabled; has suffered a loss of the enjoyment of a normal life; has been damaged in her capacity to earn a living; has incurred and will in the future incur expenses for medical services, all of which are permanent in nature." [...] In response to the suit, Paramount released the following statement: [...] "We are all terribly sorry that this accident occurred. Our thoughts, prayers and best wishes are with Gabriela, her family and loved ones. The production will continue to provide all the help we can to Gabriela and her family during this difficult time." [...] On May 2012, it was revealed that an $18 million settlement had been reached between Paramount and the Cedillo family.|$|E

2500|$|Huhne {{was an avid}} {{supporter}} of Professor David Nutt after he was dismissed by Home Secretary Alan Johnson {{as chairman of the}} Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) in November 2009.

Huhne said the decision to sack Nutt was [...] "disgraceful" [...] and commented: [...] "what is the point of having independent scientific advice if {{as soon as you get}} some advice that you don't like, you sack the person who has given it to you?". Attacking the government, he said that if they did not want to take expert scientific advice they might as <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> [...] "committee of tabloid newspaper editors to advise on drugs policy".

2500|$|After Love Never Dies {{opened on}} 9 March 2010 in London, it {{received}} mostly negative critical reviews. Perhaps {{the most positive}} review was Paul Taylor's in The Independent giving the show five stars, and writing, [...] "What is in no doubt is the technical excellence of Jack O'Brien's seamlessly fluent, sumptuous (and sometimes subtle) production, or the splendour of the orchestra which pours forth Lloyd Webber's dark-hued, yearning melodies as if its life depended on them. Special praise {{should go to the}} lyrical lavishness of Bob Crowley and Jon Driscoll's designs, with their gilt interiors where the vegetation-imitating contours and giant peacock-plumage of Art Nouveau run rampant, and their ghostly external locations where a brilliantly deployed combination of flowing projection (timed to perfection with emotional/ rhythmic shifts in the music) and solidly presented stage-effects create a dizzying Coney Island of the mind". In stark contrast, Ben Brantley of The New York Times gave it zero stars, calling the production [...] "a big, gaudy new show. And he might as <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> [...] "kick me" [...] sign pasted to his backside. ... This poor sap of a show feels as eager to be walloped as a clown in a carnival dunking booth.

2500|$|The {{critical}} {{first step}} in homology modeling is {{the identification of the}} best template structure, if indeed any are available. [...] The simplest method of template identification relies on serial pairwise sequence alignments aided by database search techniques such as FASTA and BLAST. More sensitive methods based on multiple sequence alignment â of which PSI-BLAST is the most common example â iteratively update their position-specific scoring matrix to successively identify more distantly related homologs. This family of methods has been shown to produce a larger number of potential templates and to identify better templates for sequences that have only distant relationships to any solved structure. Protein threading, also known as fold recognition or 3D-1D alignment, can also be used as a search technique for identifying templates to be used in traditional homology modeling methods. Recent CASP experiments indicate that some protein threading methods such as RaptorX indeed are more sensitive than purely sequence(profile)-based methods when only distantly-related templates are available for the proteins under prediction. When performing a BLAST search, a reliable first approach is to identify hits with a sufficiently low E-value, which are considered sufficiently close in evolution to make a reliable homology model. [...] Other factors may tip the balance in marginal cases; for example, the template may have a function {{similar to that of the}} query sequence, or it may belong to a homologous operon. [...] However, a template with a poor E-value should generally not be chosen, even if it is the only one available, since it may <b>well</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wrong structure, leading to the production of a misguided model. [...] A better approach is to submit the primary sequence to fold-recognition servers [...] or, better still, consensus meta-servers which improve upon individual fold-recognition servers by identifying similarities (consensus) among independent predictions.|$|E
