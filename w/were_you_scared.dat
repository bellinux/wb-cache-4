However, her memory is as alive to me now as it was 27 years ago when I {{travelled}} with her bloodied body in the ambulance to the Ulster Hospital. It is the same for the other victims of the Troubles."

5000|$|Roversi {{has said}} of his technique: My {{photography}} is more subtraction than addition. I always try to take off things. We all {{have a sort of}} mask of expression. You say goodbye, <b>you</b> smile, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>scared.</b> I try to take all these masks away and little by little subtract until you have something pure left. A kind of abandon, a kind of absence. It looks like an absence, but in fact when there is this emptiness I think the interior beauty comes out. This is my technique.|$|R

5000|$|Rod, {{putting his}} newly {{acquired}} climbing skills to use, climbs the scaffolding {{in an attempt}} to rescue Bart using Toot Toot's son (Mr. Teeny, Krusty the Clown's pet Chimp) as an exchange. Marge convinces Ned to learn that he must believe in his son and not worry about harm in order for Rod {{to make it to the}} top, and successfully rescue Bart from the chimp. At that rate, Ned praises Rod to be brave and go up the scaffolding to get the job done. Eventually Rod reaches the top, rescuing Bart while Toot Toot reunites with Mr. Teeny, much to Krusty's annoyance, who now needs to hire a new animal sidekick. While Bart and Rod climb, Bart tells Rod not to hold hands with him because it's 'gay', which he tells Todd means 'when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>scared</b> of something and now <b>you</b> aren't <b>scared</b> of it anymore'. The main section of the episode ends with Rod yelling to Ned that 'Mrs. Simpson made me gay!' ...|$|R
