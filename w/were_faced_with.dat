5|$|During {{the early}} 1880s, Alexandru Macedonski and his Literatorul {{attempted}} to preserve Heliade's status and his theories when these <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> criticism from Junimea; by 1885, this rivalry ended in defeat for Macedonski, {{and contributed to}} the disestablishment of Literatorul.|$|E
5|$|The Glorious First of June {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} the major problems inherent in the French and British navies {{at the start of the}} Revolutionary Wars. Both admirals <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> disobedience from their captains, along with ill-discipline and poor training among their shorthanded crews, and they failed to control their fleets effectively during the height of the combat.|$|E
5|$|The ages of {{globular}} clusters place a bound {{on the age}} limit of the entire universe. This lower limit {{has been a significant}} constraint in cosmology. Historically, astronomers <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> age estimates of {{globular clusters}} that appeared older than cosmological models would allow. However, better measurements of cosmological parameters through deep sky surveys and satellites such as the Hubble Space Telescope appear to have resolved this issue.|$|E

50|$|The {{station is}} a shallow level design with two side {{platforms}} and {{a row of}} pillars in between. Decoratively, the pillars <b>are</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> pink marble, whilst {{the top of the}} walls <b>are</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> dark red ceramic tiles, and the bottom with beige marble. The floor is laid with grey granite.|$|R

5|$|The {{scattered}} {{nature of}} the airborne landings caused some confusion among the German high command. At the LXII Corps headquarters, several reports of the landings exaggerated their strength, causing the Germans to believe they <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> a far greater force. Also, 600 dummy paratroops that had landed {{to the north and}} west of Toulon, as part of the Allied deception plan, convinced the Germans another landing had taken place there.|$|E
5|$|The {{sides of}} the {{building}} <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> plain brick, and flanked by narrow alleys with iron gates at each entrance. The walls generally had plain windows, {{though there was a}} round arched one {{on each side of the}} fourth floor. One fire escape remained, in the east alley.|$|E
5|$|As {{the reigning}} {{champions of the}} UEFA Champions League, Manchester United began their title defence at the group stage, {{for which they were}} given the top seed. This {{position}} amongst the top eight European clubs meant that they would avoid drawing former European champions Barcelona, Internazionale and Real Madrid until at least the first knockout round, although they <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> the prospect of drawing Bayern Munich or Roma. Nevertheless, United ended up being drawn into Group E with two teams they had played against before: Villarreal (whom they had drawn in 2005–06) and Celtic (2006–07); and one they had not: Aalborg BK.|$|E

5|$|Following World War I (a {{period when}} the Machine Gun Corps was based in the park, as {{referred}} to in Henry Williamson's Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight), the Brownlows, like many of their peers, <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> mounting financial problems. In 1984 they gave the house away—complete with most of its contents. The recipients of their gift, the National Trust, today fully open Belton to the public. It is in a {{good state of repair}} and visited by many thousands of tourists each year.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the landing}} the BBCAU {{detachment}} and 24th Brigade <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> a significant humanitarian challenge. The Allied air and naval attacks had destroyed {{almost all of}} the buildings on Labuan, rendering large numbers of civilians homeless. Within days of the invasion, about 3,000 civilians were housed in a compound within the beachhead. The BBCAU party were unable to assist so many civilians, and the 24th Brigade needed to assign soldiers to support them and transport supplies.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu's nephew, Grigore, {{himself a}} local {{leader of the}} Conservative Party and a major landowner, married to Adela Cantacuzino-Pașcanu, {{a member of the}} Cantacuzino family. He died in 1904, leaving his wife a large fortune, which she spent on a large {{collection}} of jewels and fortune-telling séances. Adela Kogălniceanu was robbed and murdered in October 1920; rumor had it that she had been killed by her own son, but this path was never pursued by authorities, who were quick to cancel the investigation (at the time, they <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> the major strikes of 1920).|$|E

5|$|When {{the time}} came to begin You Only Live Twice, the {{producers}} <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> the problem of a disenchanted star. Sean Connery had stated that he was tired of playing James Bond and all of the associated commitment (time spent filming and publicising each movie), together with finding it difficult to do other work, which would potentially lead to typecasting. Saltzman and Broccoli were able to persuade Connery by increasing his fee for the film, but geared up to look for a replacement.|$|E
5|$|Writing in 2009, Biran {{suggests}} that De Stem des Bloeds was clearly written from an Indo {{point of view}} because of the positive roles of Indo children. He finds the film sympathetic to native culture, including the faithful njai. He notes with interest that, although in real life mixed-race children <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> a sense of disgust, in De Stem des Bloeds an Indo man is heroic enough to rescue a pure Dutch woman and fight with a Dutchman.|$|E
5|$|After the Democrats' electoral {{victories}} in 1951 and 1955, {{they hoped to}} further solidify their hold on city offices by ousting the few Republicans left in power. At the same time, however, they <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> growing divisions within their own party. Democrats had won in 1951 by combining with reform-minded Republicans and independents. By 1954, however, some Democrats led by Council President James Hugh Joseph Tate tried to weaken the civil service reforms of the new charter by allowing city employees {{to become involved in}} electioneering once more. They fell just short of the two-thirds vote in Council to put their amendments on the ballot, but in 1956, Tate's faction again proposed charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections and this time found the required vote to put it on to the ballot for popular approval. The referendum failed in a vote that April.|$|E

5|$|After {{the rest}} day, the riders <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> the Giro's longest stage, with {{numerous}} high mountain climbs along {{the course and}} {{the distinction of being}} the race's queen stage. It was originally scheduled to include the Col d'Izoard, which has been featured numerous times in the Tour de France as an Hors Categorie climb. Race officials later decided to alter the course, staying on the Italian side of the Alps, believing the stretches that were to take place in France were too remote and that radio communication in the area could not be assured. The course as it originally was designed mimicked exactly a course used in the 1949 Giro d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|Following Temple's marriage, {{his father}} had {{invested}} in a farming venture by Edward Whalley who was the brother-in-law of Temple's stepsister - Mary Penistone. Sir Alexander apparently intended this to provide an inheritance for his grandchildren (the children of James Temple). As a younger son himself, Sir Alexander wanted to ensure suitable provision for his own younger son. This investment made by Temple's father {{for the benefit of}} his children had apparently become valueless when Edward Whalley fled to Scotland in the late 1630s. However, in the 1650s, Whalley had become a prominent and successful member of the Puritan establishment and there was a possibility of recovering some money. In the late 1650s, Temple and Whalley went to the Court of Chancery to determine what was due to Temple and his children. However, with the death of Oliver Cromwell and the subsequent restoration of Charles II, both regicides <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> the possibility of execution and the case appears to have been unresolved.|$|E
5|$|Fonseca and the navy's {{high command}} <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> two {{extremely}} unpalatable choices. They {{could use the}} government-controlled ships to attack and possibly destroy the rebel ships, but doing so would mean destroying three incredibly expensive ships that had received significant global attention and were—in their eyes—a crucial part of refashioning Brazil as a serious international power. Worse, {{there was a significant}} chance that the remaining Brazilian ships, all of which were smaller and much older than the ships controlled by the mutineers, would lose if it came to open combat. But by folding and giving into the rebel's list of demands—that is, demands from the underclass and broadly black naval crews—the elites would suffer an incredible embarrassment.|$|E

5|$|In 1796, {{after three}} years of the French Revolutionary Wars, Spain and the French Republic signed the Treaty of San Ildefonso. The secret terms of this treaty {{required}} Spain to renounce its alliance with Great Britain and subsequently to declare war on its former ally. In the East Indies this shift of political allegiance meant that the dominant British forces in the region <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> the threat of attack from the Spanish Philippines to the east. Britain dominated the East Indies in 1796, controlling the trade routes through the Indian Ocean from the ports of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta. Dutch Ceylon, the Dutch Cape Colony and parts of the Dutch East Indies had been captured in 1795, and the French presence in the region had been confined to Île de France and a few subsidiary islands in the Western Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, naturalists <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> {{increasing}} pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. Ecology had {{emerged as a}} combination of biogeography with the biogeochemical cycle concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the quadrat and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution and the Marine Biological Laboratory provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.|$|E
5|$|Often {{armed with}} no more than shovels and spades, {{soldiers}} and civilians dug for bodies in the rubble. Other than this, rescue workers <b>were</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> a number of obstacles, including the temperatures of the villages damaged. They were warm during the day, although the villages grew colder at night, making rescue work harder and threatening the health of the homeless and anyone alive and trapped under the debris. Many civilians were discouraged from helping due to fear of aftershocks. According to Gary Oshea of International Rescue, the volunteers did not have enough technical equipment, and the religious leaders seemed unwilling to contribute much. Official rescue work ended on June 24, 2002, when rescue workers said there were no more survivors.|$|E
