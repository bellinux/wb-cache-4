By the 1980s, such discrimination <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of the past, and today most U.S. Grand Lodges recognise their Prince Hall counterparts, and the authorities of both traditions are working towards full recognition. The United Grand Lodge of England has no problem with recognising Prince Hall Grand Lodges. While celebrating their heritage as lodges of black Americans, Prince Hall is open to all men regardless of race or religion.|$|E

25|$|World War II and the {{war effort}} in Montreal resurrected trams crowding. In 1944, the MTC {{proposed}} a two-line network, one line running underneath Saint Catherine Street, the other under Saint Denis and Notre-Dame and Saint Jacques Streets. In 1953 the newly formed public Montreal Transportation Commission replaced streetcars by buses and proposed a single subway line reusing the 1944 plans and extending {{it all the way}} to Boulevard Crémazie, right by the D'Youville maintenance shops. By this point, construction was already well underway on Canada's first subway line in Toronto under Yonge Street, which would be opened in 1954. Still, Montreal councillors remained cautious and no work was initiated. For some of them, including Jean Drapeau during its first municipal term, public transit <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of the past.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1920s {{a large number}} of Cangaço bandit groups were in existence. When Lampião became a cangaceiro, joining the Cangaço was almost the {{equivalent}} of a career choice. At the time of Lampião's death, he was the only independent bandit leader remaining. However, his major subordinates, such as Ângelo Roque and Corisco, often led bandits in semi-independent operations at a considerable distance from the main camp, sometimes across state borders. It was Lampião's intelligence and charisma that ensured that large-scale banditry remained viable in the changing environment of late 1930s Brazil. Within two years of his death Cangaço <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of the past. A number of potential bandit leaders, such as Corisco, and lesser bandits were killed; many more, like Ângelo Roque, gave themselves up to the authorities on assurance of escaping the death penalty and leniency. Some bandits even turned on colleagues, killing and decapitating them; they then reported to the police with the severed head to show that their renunciation of banditry was sincere.|$|E

We also had some nice development in the Jim-Pam-Karen triangle, with Pam giving Jim relationship advice, then bawling her eyes out afterwards. Maybe the best scene in the episode saw Dwight comfort her." [...] Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A.|$|E

500|$|The Allman Brothers Band were {{considerably}} influential {{within the}} Southern United States. Their arrival on the musical scene {{paved the way}} for several other notable Southern rock acts — among those Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Marshall Tucker Band and Wet Willie — to achieve commercial success, and also [...] "almost single-handedly" [...] made Capricorn Records into [...] "a major independent label." [...] Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, writing for Rolling Stone, wrote that the group [...] "defined the best of every music from the American South in that time. They were the best of all of us." [...] He went on to call the band [...] "a true brotherhood of players — one that went beyond race and ego. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of beauty."

500|$|Upon release, {{the album}} was well {{received}} by reviewers. Sounds gave Join Hands a grade of 4.5 out of 5, with the reviewer, Pete Silverton, noting {{a change in the}} sound: [...] "The mix is different to the last album. Now there's a clarity which frames Sue's voice like it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of treasure". Silverton also wrote that some of the songs have [...] "Siouxsie's voice double-tracked with devastating effect". Jon Savage, a Melody Maker reviewer, described the first track, [...] "Poppy Day", as a [...] "short, powerful evocation of the Great War graveyards in Flanders". He also wrote that [...] "Placebo Effect" [...] "has a stunning flanged guitar intro, chasing clinical lyrics covering some insertion or operation". About [...] "Icon", Savage wrote: [...] "The brilliantly reverbed guitar is a perfect foil for Siouxsie's soaring and, for once, emotional vocal." [...] Savage noted that the five songs of the first side [...] "rise and fall into another in a stunning segue". Similarly, Paul Morley [...] wrote in NME that [...] "Side one's five songs [...] are all addictive Banshees mini-dramas". Ronnie Gurr, a Record Mirror reviewer, also hailed the record, saying: [...] "Poppy Day establishes the band's perfect employ of atmospherics and sets the tone of all the tracks". [...] "Mother" [...] was compared to the soundtrack of an Alfred Hitchcock film, with Gurr noting that the [...] "track features a musical box, echoes menacing guitar grumblings and Siouxsie providing vocals that would befit any of Hitchcock's best matricides". Gurr concluded that with [...] "Severin's truly disturbing scratchings", Join Hands was a dangerous work that [...] "should be heard".|$|E
500|$|Although Cherry {{points out}} that Chamberlain was an egotist, {{he added that he}} had good {{relationships}} with many contemporaries and enjoyed a great deal of respect. He was especially lauded for his good rapport with his fans, often providing tickets and signing autographs. Dr. Jack Ramsay recalled that Chamberlain regularly took walks in downtown Philadelphia and acknowledged honking horns with the air of a man enjoying all the attention. Jerry West called him a [...] "complex... very nice person", and NBA rival Jack McMahon even said: [...] "The best thing that happened to the NBA is that God made Wilt a nice person... he could have killed us all with his left hand." [...] Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy even assumed that if Chamberlain had been less fixated on being popular, he would have been meaner and able to win more titles. During most of his NBA career, Chamberlain was good friends with Bill Russell. Chamberlain often invited Russell over to Thanksgiving, and at Russell's place, conversation mostly concerned Russell's electric trains. But as the championship count became increasingly lopsided, the relationship got strained, and turned hostile after Russell accused Chamberlain of [...] "copping out" [...] in the notorious Game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals. The two men did not talk to each other for over 20 years, until Russell apologized privately, then publicly in a 1997 joint interview with Bob Costas: [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> almost 30 years ago... I was wrong." [...] Still, Chamberlain maintained a level of bitterness, regretted that he should have been [...] "more physical" [...] with Russell in their games and privately continued accusing his rival for [...] "intellectualizing" [...] basketball in a negative way.|$|E
