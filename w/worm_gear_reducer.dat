Optimal level cut-set method is introduced to conduct comprehensive evaluation on constraining fuzziness and convert the fuzzy constraint into general constraint according to the actual conditions and requirements; for multi-objectives, single-objective optimal solutions are fuzzified to form fuzzy sets to establish the membership functions of the fuzzy sets by taking the fuzziness between the single objectives and between the single objectives and multiple objectives into consideration, and multi-objective optimal solutions are obtained by maximizing the membership functions of the fuzzy set intersection. For an actual worm reducer, the fuzzy theory and method are applied to obtain results, and the validness of the method is demonstrated by comparing such results with the conventional design data.

In order to substitute for the bronze, {{a new kind of}} antifriction composite material of polymer-matrix, ZW- 1 material has been successfully developed.

In order to bring the excellent properties of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> transmission of ZW- 1 material into play and substitute for bronze, the test for anti-fracture capacity of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> made of ZW- 1 material under static load has been made. A simple test-bed is designed. The test has been carried out under static load. The test of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> with ZW- 1 and nylon materials, different teeth numbers、tooth width and tooth forms is made. The test findings show that in the test conditions the invalidation of ZW- 1 <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> is radial fracture in gear rim. Applying stress transmission theory and micrographic analysis, fracture mechanism of ZW- 1 material is found out, namely degumming on the interface between fiber and polymer. Anti-fracture capacity of <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> of ZW- 1 material is twenty three times as much as that of bronze worm gear(Q/ZB 125 - 73).
