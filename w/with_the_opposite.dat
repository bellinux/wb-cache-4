5|$|Eve is an American {{television}} sitcom, {{created by}} Meg DeLoatch, which originally aired for three seasons on United Paramount Network (UPN) from September 15, 2003 to May 11, 2006. Featuring an ensemble cast consisting of Eve, Jason George, Ali Landry, Natalie Desselle-Reid, Brian Hooks, and Sean Maguire, the show revolves around {{two sets of}} male and female friends attempting to navigate relationships <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> sex. The executive producers were Robert Greenblatt and David Janollari; the series was produced by The Greenblatt-Janollari Studio and Mega Diva Inc. in association with Warner Bros. Television for UPN.|$|E
5|$|Each {{particle}} {{of matter}} has a corresponding antimatter particle <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> electrical charge. Thus, the positron is a positively charged antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged {{equivalent of a}} proton. When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an imbalance {{between the number of}} matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this imbalance are not yet fully understood, although theories of baryogenesis may offer an explanation. As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature. However, in 1996 the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom (antihydrogen) was synthesized at the CERN laboratory in Geneva.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds of cross-dressing and many different reasons why an individual might engage in cross-dressing behavior.

25|$|CRTs with an unphosphored {{front glass}} but with fine wires {{embedded}} in it {{were used as}} electrostatic print heads in the 1960s.

25|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} studies {{on the effectiveness of}} both approaches, and conflicting data on American public opinion. Public opinion polls conducted over the years have found that the majority of Americans favor broader sex education programs over those that teach only abstinence, although abstinence educators recently published poll data <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> conclusion. The poll sponsored by the National Abstinence Education Association and conducted by Zogby International reported information that has not been replicated in methodologically sound surveys.|$|E
25|$|There are an infinitude {{of lines}} that bisect {{the area of}} a {{triangle}}. Three of them are the medians of the triangle (which connect the sides' midpoints <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> vertices), and these are concurrent at the triangle's centroid; indeed, {{they are the only}} area bisectors that go through the centroid. Any line through a triangle that splits both the triangle's area and its perimeter in half goes through the triangle's incenter (the center of its incircle). There are either one, two, or three of these for any given triangle.|$|E

More precisely, the two representations are related by the parity involution ' of ClnC (also known as the principal automorphism), which is the identity on the even subalgebra, and minus the identity on the odd part of ClnC. In other words, there is a linear isomorphism from S to S, which identifies the action of A in ClnC on S with the action of '(A) on S.|$|E
25|$|An {{altitude}} of a triangle is {{a straight line}} through a vertex and perpendicular to (i.e. forming a right angle <b>with)</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> side. This opposite side is called {{the base of the}} altitude, and the point where the altitude intersects the base (or its extension) is called the foot of the altitude. The length of the altitude is the distance between the base and the vertex. The three altitudes intersect in a single point, called the orthocenter of the triangle, usually denoted by H. The orthocenter lies inside the triangle if and only if the triangle is acute.|$|E
25|$|Sexual dimorphisms {{in animals}} are often {{associated}} with sexual selection – the competition between individuals of one sex to mate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> sex. Antlers in male deer, for example, are used in combat between males to win reproductive access to female deer. In many cases the male of a species {{is larger than the}} female. Mammal species with extreme sexual size dimorphism tend to have highly polygynous mating systems—presumably due to selection for success in competition with other males—such as the elephant seals. Other examples demonstrate that it is the preference of females that drive sexual dimorphism, such {{as in the case of}} the stalk-eyed fly.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} between these two approaches, and their impact on teen behavior, remains a controversial subject. In the U.S., teenage birth rates had been dropping since 1991, but a 2007 report showed a 3% increase from 2005 to 2006. From 1991 to 2005, the percentage of teens reporting that they had ever had sex or were currently sexually active showed small declines. However, the U.S. still has the highest teen birth rate and one of the highest rates of STIs among teens in the industrialized world. Public opinion polls conducted over the years have found {{that the vast majority of}} Americans favor broader sex education programs over those that teach only abstinence, although abstinence educators recently published poll data <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> conclusion.|$|E
25|$|Crocodiles {{are also}} the most vocal of all reptiles, {{producing}} {{a wide variety of}} sounds during various situations and conditions, depending on species, age, size and sex. Depending on the context, some species can communicate over 20 different messages through vocalizations alone. Some of these vocalizations are made during social communication, especially during territorial displays towards the same sex and courtship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> sex; the common concern being reproduction. Therefore most conspecific vocalization is made during the breeding season, with the exception being year-round territorial behaviour in some species and quarrels during feeding. Crocodiles also produce different distress calls and in aggressive displays to their own kind and other animals; notably other predators during interspecific predatory confrontations over carcasses and terrestrial kills.|$|E
25|$|The progeny in {{this case}} {{received}} two dominant alleles linked on one chromosome (referred to as coupling or cis arrangement). However, after crossover, some progeny could have received one parental chromosome with a dominant allele for one trait (e.g. Purple) linked to a recessive allele for a second trait (e.g. round) <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> being true for the other parental chromosome (e.g. red and Long). This {{is referred to as}} repulsion or a trans arrangement. The phenotype here would still be purple and long but a test cross of this individual with the recessive parent would produce progeny with much greater proportion of the two crossover phenotypes. While such a problem may not seem likely from this example, unfavourable repulsion linkages do appear when breeding for disease resistance in some crops.|$|E
