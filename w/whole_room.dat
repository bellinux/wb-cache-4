5|$|I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! (sometimes I Can See the <b>Whole</b> <b>Room</b> and There's Nobody in It! {{or simply}} I Can See the <b>Whole</b> <b>Room!)</b> is a 1961 {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein. It is {{a painting of}} a man looking through a peephole. It formerly held the record for highest auction price for a Lichtenstein painting.|$|E
5|$|Lichtenstein {{frequently}} explored vision-related themes {{after he}} began {{to work in the}} pop art genre; early examples include I Can See the Whole Room...and There's Nobody in It! and Look Mickey. In this painting, Donald's large eyes indicate his belief that he has caught something big while Mickey's small eyes indicate his disbelief that Donald has caught anything significant. Like Lichenstein's works with subjects looking through a periscope (Torpedo...Los!), a mirror (Girl in Mirror) or a peephole (I Can See the <b>Whole</b> <b>Room...</b> and There's Nobody in It!), Look Mickey, with a subject looking at his reflection in the water, is a prominent example of the theme of vision. He uses narrative to emphasize this motif, while presenting several visual elements.|$|E
25|$|The camera (or 'camera obscura') is a {{dark room}} or chamber from which, as far as possible, all light is {{excluded}} except the light that forms the image. It was discovered and used in the 16th century by painters. The subject being photographed, however, must be illuminated. Cameras can range from small to very large, a <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> that is kept dark while the object to be photographed is in another room where it is properly illuminated. This was common for reproduction photography of flat copy when large film negatives were used (see Process camera).|$|E
50|$|The mansion was {{abandoned}} by its builders {{in the middle}} of construction, leaving behind a building that appears complete from the outside, but with floors, plaster and <b>whole</b> <b>rooms</b> missing inside. It has remained in this state since the mid-1870s.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{after an}} initial 'walk-round sale' or auction was carried out, fixtures, {{fittings}} (and occasionally <b>whole</b> <b>rooms)</b> were sold off to museums or for re-installation in other properties. The main buildings were then un-roofed or demolished (see Destruction of country houses in 20th-century Britain).|$|R
50|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{is common}} usage of black marble. Altars, fonts, portals, balustrades, columns, monuments, tombstones, headstones and <b>whole</b> <b>rooms</b> (e.g. Marble Room at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, St. Casimir Chapel of the Vilnius Cathedral and Vasa Chapel of the Wawel Cathedral) were decorated with black marble.|$|R
500|$|We {{did three}} or four songs in {{three or four}} days. The way we was doing it, I had [...] down there along with me. We had the <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> set up with candles, some nice wine a very good vibe. It was {{completely}} stripped down, like 'Mariah Carey Unplugged'. She stripped herself down to her talent. She was really trusting of me and my vision, and I was trusting of who she was.|$|E
500|$|The work is {{an example}} of Lichtenstein's {{presentation}} of the uncertainty of the one-eyed perspective. It {{is considered to be a}} work on the subject of [...] "focal vision and blindness", and it is a prominent example of the theme running through Lichtenstein's art relating to vision. He uses the narrative to emphasize this theme, while playing on both the circular peephole and the circular eyes. The depicted mechanical device, a peephole in this case, forces the vision into a monocular format. Monocularity is funnelled through the primitive peephole apparatus that almost mimics a camera lens. In some senses, monocularity of this work is a strong theme that is directly embodied although only by allusion. In addition, the work is considered to be closely related to his later work, Image Duplicator (1963), which is regarded as a correction of I Can See the <b>Whole</b> <b>Room!</b> with its glaring and aggressive binocularity. The monocularity of I Can See the <b>Whole</b> <b>Room!</b> should be viewed as a concentrated form of monocularity, such as [...] "the common experience of closing one eye in order to fix an object in the gaze", but a subordinated form of monocularity that is enhanced by technology.|$|E
500|$|Tesla {{theorized that}} the {{application}} of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence. In 1912, he crafted [...] "a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity," [...] wiring {{the walls of a}} schoolroom and, [...] "saturating [...] with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency. The <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> will thus, Mr. Tesla claims, be converted into a health-giving and stimulating electromagnetic field or 'bath.'" [...] The plan was, at least provisionally, approved by then superintendent of New York City schools, William H. Maxwell.|$|E
50|$|He {{is known}} for decorations for <b>whole</b> <b>rooms,</b> though little has survived of the work he did for Teylers Stichting. On the Gedempte Oude Gracht, Haarlem, a series of wall decorations symbolizing the four seasons remain as they were {{installed}} in 1776 in house number 90-92 (today a furniture store, open to the public).|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} half of the twentieth century we have been {{experiencing}} an extraordinary technological revolution, especially in the computer and telecommunications fields. Twenty-five years ago, the latest computers not only took up <b>whole</b> <b>rooms</b> in computer centers, but were orders of magnitude slower and more expensive than today’s PC that can easily be carried aroun...|$|R
50|$|Pynacker is {{considered}} {{an example of an}} Italianate landscape painter, along with Jan Both, Jan Baptist Weenix, Nicolaes Berchem and Jan Asselyn. He specialized in decorating <b>whole</b> <b>rooms.</b> According to Houbraken, he would turn in his grave if he knew how the fashions had changed, but fortunately the poet P. Verhoek wrote a poem about one of his decorated rooms.|$|R
500|$|Destiny Jones was in {{the studio}} when they were {{recording}} [...] "Daughters". [...] "We were in a big studio so Destiny was doing other things", Nas later told Vibe. [...] "She {{walked into the room}} where I was recording it and heard a few words and said, ‘What’s going on?’ The <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> just started laughing and she kind of smiled and walked backwards out of the room. She didn’t know what it was about and she didn’t want to listen to it, but later on she heard the song." ...|$|E
500|$|Sutcliffe {{was fascinated}} by the trio, but {{especially}} Kirchherr, and thought they looked like [...] "real bohemians". Bill Harry later said that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way, and that she always captivated the <b>whole</b> <b>room.</b> Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly take his eyes off her and had tried to talk to Kirchherr during the next break, but she had already left the club. Sutcliffe managed to meet them eventually, and learned that all three had attended the Meisterschule, which was the same type of art college that Lennon and Sutcliffe had attended in Liverpool. (Note: Meisterschule für Mode, Textil, Grafik und Werbung , although it is now called the University of Applied Sciences).|$|E
500|$|The picture teases {{the viewer}} who {{is given the}} feeling that he is in a dark room being viewed by the main subject of the {{painting}} who is a man that peeks {{through a hole in the}} door. The narrative element of the image, which included a speech bubble that presents the caption [...] "I Can See the <b>Whole</b> <b>Room</b> and There's Nobody in It", clarifies that the man can not see anything in the room although he has a good look at it. The work is a satirical reference to abstraction because it can be imagined as a monochrome canvas that is affected by an actor that has inserted his finger as well as a narrative that also violates this imagining. This finger is also regarded as phallic.|$|E
25|$|St. Peter's Church also {{contains}} thirteenth century remnants of St. Louis' citadel located outside {{and to the}} right of the sacristy. The remnants include two <b>whole</b> <b>rooms</b> which are circular in shape, have low ceilings and fire embrasures. It is in these rooms that Napoleon is said to have lived while he was at St. Peter's in 1799 during the French campaign in Egypt and Syria.|$|R
50|$|The first era ({{mainframe}} and minicomputer) {{was ruled}} by IBM and their mainframe computers; these computers would often take up <b>whole</b> <b>rooms</b> and require teams to run them—IBM supplied the hardware and the software. As technology advanced, these computers {{were able to}} handle greater capacities and therefore reduce their cost. Smaller, more affordable minicomputers allowed larger businesses to run their own computing centers in-house / on-site / on-premises.|$|R
50|$|Weber's unwilling {{collaborator}} was Roque de Alcubierre, {{previously in}} charge of the excavations, whose treasure-hunting technique provided the fine bronzes and other works of art that kept royal patronage stimulated. Alcubierre was jealous of Weber, treated his system of excavating <b>whole</b> <b>rooms</b> with a concern for context that makes him a heroic forerunner of today's architectural profession, and attempted to sabotage Weber's his work. On Weber's death, the architect Francisco La Vega was put {{in charge of}} excavations.|$|R
2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the comic strip came from Dennis Ketcham, the real life son of Hank Ketcham, who was only four {{years old when he}} refused to take a nap and somehow messed up his <b>whole</b> <b>room.</b> Hank tried many possible names for the character, and translated them into rough pencil sketches. But when his studio door flew open and his then-wife Alice, in utter exasperation, exclaimed, [...] "Your son is a menace!", the [...] "Dennis the Menace" [...] name stuck. The character of Henry Mitchell bore a striking resemblance to Ketcham. The Mitchell family of Dennis, Hank/Henry, and Alice were all named after the Ketchams.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the desert}} scenes, Pecorini wanted a specific, {{undefined}} quality without a real horizon {{to convey the}} notion that the landscape never ended and to emphasize [...] "a certain kind of unreality outside the characters' car, because everything that matters to them is within the Red Shark." [...] For the scene where Duke hallucinates a lounge full of lizards, the production was supposed to have 25 animatronic reptiles but they only received seven or eight. The production used motion-control techniques {{to make it look like}} they had a <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> of them and made multiple passes with the cameras outfitting the lizards with different costumes each time.|$|E
2500|$|The word {{itself is}} thought to have {{linguist}} roots tied to the word hordeum which in Latin means 'barley'. In the John's Hopkin's University Press, The Classical Weekly states that [...] "Pliny the Elder does indeed make a distinction between the two words6. He describes the horreum as a structure made of brick, the walls of which were not less than three feet thick; it had no windows or openings for ventilation". Furthermore, the storehouses would also host oil and wine and also utilize large jars that could serve as cache's for large amounts of products.These storehouses were also used to house keep large sums of money and were used much like personal storage units today are. Romans were [...] "These horrea were divided and subdivided, so that one could hire only so much space as one wanted, a <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> (cella), a closet (armarium), or only a chest or strong box (arca, arcula, locus, loculus)." ...|$|E

50|$|In the 17th century, Dutch traders brought Chinese mother-of-pearl, lacquer, silks and {{porcelain}} to Europe. In {{the noble}} courts of the baroque era, {{an interest in}} Oriental arts grew during the rococo period into Chinoiserie, a genuine fashion for all things Chinese. In addition to the enthusiasm for Asian luxury goods which harmonized with the certain forms of rococo, travelogues and exhibitions portrayed the carefree living of the Chinese, which corresponded with the European courts' ideal of a relaxed lifestyle. <b>Whole</b> <b>rooms</b> of palaces were decorated with porcelain, small Chinese-style furniture and wall murals which presented the ideal world that was supposedly China.|$|R
50|$|Many rows of shelves cover every wall, all {{filled to}} {{capacity}} with dolls from the 19th century to present. Many collections are specific. The collection contains over 50 Shirley Temple dolls, over a hundred Madame Alexander, Effenbe, and many other makers both foreign and domestic. Ethnic Dolls, celebrities, dolls used in Advertising, and many other themes hold specific rooms of the house. In addition, {{there are two major}} fully furnished dollhouses that take up <b>whole</b> <b>rooms</b> of their own: A complete replica of Tara, the mansion from the movie Gone With The Wind, as well as a New England Saltbox house complete with furnishings.|$|R
2500|$|During this period, he {{is known}} to have resorted to extreme {{measures}} of sense control which involve self-abnegation methods like fasting for months together (having just a cup of tea a day) while taking huge quantities of food at other times. During this time, he confined himself in a dark room with a lamp that used to be lit up at all times. He would often be found lying on bed while facing the wall. He did not allow very many people in his room during this period. <b>Whole</b> <b>room</b> and his bed used to be covered with a lot of dust and one could find cobwebs and spiders around the room but he wouldn't bother cleaning it or let anyone else clean it. A rat is said to have nibbled a hole into one of his heels during this time though he {{is said to have been}} oblivious to its pain. His only constant companion in the room besides the burning lamp was his pipe. During this time he would take intoxicants like opium and sometimes vomit a lot of blood. His whole body had swollen and had become weak. On one occasion his sister reminded him of the financial difficulties they were going through but he is said to have responded by saying (translated here into English) [...] "our boat is in the middle of ocean right now, either we would reach ashore safe or drown". Some religious writers think he might have practised some form of tantric spiritual practice like pranabhasya during this time. After seven such years of his spiritual practice, his devotees affirm that he had become, what they call in Hinduism, a siddha purusha (one who attains spiritual powers) as it was right after this period that people started flocking him to get their worldly problems solved.|$|E
60|$|The {{darkness}} {{began to}} tear at her nerves. She felt {{along the wall}} for the switch, and flooded the <b>whole</b> <b>room</b> with light.|$|E

60|$|Dominey felt {{as though}} he were {{breathing}} an atmosphere of turgid and poisoned sweetness. There was a flavour of unreality about the <b>whole</b> situation,--the <b>room,</b> this child woman, her beauty, her deliberate, halting speech and the strange things she said.|$|R
5000|$|In the early-to-mid-1960s, slot {{car racing}} became a fad, {{and like many}} other companies, Revell {{attempted}} to enter the fray by using its plastic model car bodies with mechanicals underneath—fit for the track. In 1965 Revell acquired International Raceways, planning high grade race tracks that could fill <b>whole</b> <b>rooms.</b> [...] It {{may have been too}} much too late: The competition was too keen and the slot car hobby was already starting to wane in influence. [...] Slot car kings like Chicago's Strombecker would eventually be purchased by Tootsietoy and end up making simple plastic cars and other toys. By 1967, Revell's experiment in the hobby had racked up a nearly half-million dollar loss.|$|R

50|$|One {{of the few}} {{sites where}} wall-paintings survived in {{quantity}} is Panjakent in modern Tajikistan, and ancient Sogdia, which was barely, if at all, {{under the control of}} the central Sassanid power. The old city was abandoned in the decades after the Muslims eventually took the city in 722 and has been extensively excavated in modern times. Large areas of wall paintings survived from the palace and private houses, which are mostly now in the Hermitage Museum or Tashkent. They covered <b>whole</b> <b>rooms</b> and were accompanied by large quantities of reliefs in wood. The subjects are similar to other Sasanian art, with enthroned kings, feasts, battles, and beautiful women, and there are illustrations of both Persian and Indian epics, as well as a complex mixture of deities. They mostly date from the 7th and 8th centuries.|$|R
60|$|As she hovered at {{the door}} before entering, she could watch him while he walked the <b>whole</b> <b>room's</b> length away, and she felt a pang at sight of him. If she could have {{believed}} that he loved her, {{she could not have}} faced him, but must have turned and run away; and even as it was she grieved for him. Such a man would not have made up his mind to this step without a deep motive, if not a deep feeling. Her heart had been softened so that she could not think of frustrating his ambition, if it were no better than that, without pity. One man had made her feel very kindly toward all other men; she wished in the tender confusion of the moment that she need not reject her importunate suitor, whose importunity even she could not resent.|$|R
50|$|The Exhibition Room, 208, {{with its}} fine {{paneling}} and fireplace, {{was a gift}} from the builder at no cost to the citizens. The principal’ s office occupied the <b>whole</b> of <b>Room</b> 202 It was beautifully paneled in dark red mahogany with a beamed ceiling and plaster medallions that were masterpieces of the plasterer’s art.|$|R
