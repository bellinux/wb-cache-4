In the final <b>wire</b> <b>rod</b> <b>products,</b> defects {{originating}} from the steel making, casting, pre-rolling of billets {{and during the}} wire rod rolling can appear. In this work, artificial V-shaped longitudinal surface cracks has been analysed experimentally and by means of FEM.

40|$|In {{the fast}} {{changing}} economic scenario world over, the economic strength of any organization {{depends on the}} management’s ability in improving quality, cutting production costs and providing better customer services to compete effectively in the global market. Even though every management aims at improving the productivity, there is a limitation {{on the part of}} various production facilities located in any plant as they cannot be stretched beyond a point. However, management can exploit the existing facilities to the maximum extent possible by introducing the latest state of art technology. Against this backdrop, present production scenario at Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) is described. The key variables considered for the simulation of steel plant production activities are: production of hot metal, liquid steel, prime blooms, bar mill products and <b>wire</b> <b>rod</b> <b>products</b> over a period of 20 years from 1994 - 2013.

40|$|Very often defects {{are present}} in rolled <b>products.</b> For <b>wire</b> <b>rods,</b> defects are very {{deleterious}} since the <b>wire</b> <b>rods</b> are generally used directly in various applications. For this reason, the market nowadays requires <b>wire</b> <b>rods</b> to be completely defect-free. Any wire with defects must be rejected as scrap which is very costly for the production mill. Thus, {{it is very important}} to study the formation and evolution of defects during <b>wire</b> <b>rod</b> rolling in order to better understand and minimize the problem, at the same time improving quality of the <b>wire</b> <b>rods</b> and reducing production costs. The present work is focused on the evolution of artificial defects during rolling. Longitudinal surface defects are studied during shape rolling of an AISI M 2 high speed steel and a longitudinal central inner defect is studied in an AISI 304 L austenitic stainless steel during ultra-high-speed <b>wire</b> <b>rod</b> rolling. Experimental studies are carried out by rolling short rods prepared with arteficial defects. The evolution of the defects is characterised and compared to numerical analyses. The comparison shows that surface defects generally reduce quicker in the experiments than predicted by the simulations whereas a good agreement is generally obtained for the central defect.
