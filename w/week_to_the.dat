The expanded Second Chance takes place on a Saturday night, adding an extra <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> event's timetable. The format of voting also changed {{with the introduction of}} a knock-out system. The system pairs the eight songs off against each other, then narrows them down to four before pairing them off again. The winners of the two second round pairings go through to the final. The two finalists do not reprise their songs {{at the end of the}} programme.|$|E
5|$|Vick {{returned}} {{to form in}} 2004, passing for 2,313 yards with 14 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. He added 902 yards of rushing and three touchdowns as the Falcons finished with an 11–5 record. On October 31, 2004 {{in a game against}} the Denver Broncos, he became the first quarterback to throw for more than 250 yards and rush for over 100 yards in the same game. Vick set an NFL postseason record for a quarterback with 119 rushing yards {{in the first round of}} the 2004 NFL playoffs; Atlanta beat the St. Louis Rams in that game, but lost the following <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Philadelphia Eagles in the conference championship game. Vick, whose single-season rushing total was the third-highest for a quarterback in NFL history, was named to his second Pro Bowl after the season after leading Atlanta to their third division title. He signed a nine-year $130 million extension on December 23.|$|E

25|$|In early 2006, Virgin Blue {{announced}} {{its intention to}} operate up to seven flights a <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S. through either Los Angeles International Airport or San Francisco International Airport. At the time, only Qantas and United Airlines competed in the Australia-US transpacific market. The airline was given permission for ten flights a <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S. by Australian regulators on 24 July 2007. The plans were approved by US regulators on 15 February 2008, due to the signing of an open skies agreement between Australia and the US. Instead of using its existing brand, Virgin Blue launched a fully owned subsidiary with a separate Air Operator's Certificate, named V Australia {{as the result of}} a public naming competition, with a fleet of five specifically branded 777-300ERs.|$|E

The Boston service started on June 11 and the new JFK daily flights commenced on July 1, both being operated with new Airbus A330-200 delivered in June {{of the same year}} from Azul Brazilian Airlines. These two new routes reinforce the presence in the American market, with TAP also serving Miami from Lisbon and Newark from Lisbon and Porto. Altogether, TAP Air Portugal service grew to 30 flights per <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US.|$|E
25|$|Nebraska then {{proceeded}} to lose a close game to Virginia Tech Hokies, and then suffered the worst home loss in school history to the Missouri Tigers 52–17 the next week. The first road {{game of the season}} produced a loss to the Texas Tech Red Raiders in overtime despite giving up 8.77 yards per play. Then the Huskers traveled to Ames, Iowa and beat a 2–10 Iowa State Cyclones. They came back home and won against the Baylor Bears. Pelini's Huskers then lost on the road the following <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Oklahoma Sooners by a tune of 62–28, where Oklahoma scored 35 straight before Nebraska answered. By halftime, the score was 49–14. This game marked the first time Pelini went up against Bob Stoops who he formerly worked under as defensive coordinator for the Sooners in 2004. This game also marks the most points ever scored against Nebraska in a single quarter.|$|E
25|$|The ACT Government and Canberra Airport {{had been}} {{attempting}} {{for years to}} attract international airlines such as Air Asia X, Air New Zealand, and Emirates or persuade Qantas or Virgin Australia to commence international flights from Canberra. The airport argues {{there is a strong}} business case for flights to New Zealand. Canberra Airport managing director Stephen Byron said he believed there was a case to support about three flights a <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> capital of Wellington and another three to Auckland. In addition, the airport believes in the viability of a direct daily flight to an Asian Hub airport (such as Singapore or Hong Kong) to accommodate one-stop flights to onward destinations in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Canberra has a population of 900,000 in its catchment area (approximately 75% of that of Adelaide which has 42 weekly international services from its airport). Its status as Australia's capital city and the above average income of residents in the surrounding area provide more arguments in favour of international services at the airport.|$|E

They would rebound the next week where on the road Thursday night game they defeated Chicago 41–28 for their 9th win of the year to clinch their first winning season since 2009.

Then the Eagles put up 24 answered points but Dallas came back to win 38–27 to go into first place for the first time in the season and improve to 10–4. Going into their Week 16 matchup at home against Indianapolis, Dallas was in a position to clinch their first division title since 2009 by defeating the Colts thanks to the Eagles losing that <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Redskins. They would not disappoint as they blew out the Colts 42–7 to become the 2014 NFC East Champions, eliminating the Eagles from the playoffs. Dallas would end the regular season with a 12–4 record and an 8–0 away record when they won on the road against Washington 44–17. They would also finish December 4–0 which was huge for the Cowboys since they had struggled in the recent years in the month of December.|$|E
