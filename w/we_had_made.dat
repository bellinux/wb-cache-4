500|$|In 1999, BBC {{producer}} Rodney Wilson asked Stockhausen {{to collaborate}} with Stephen and Timothy Quay on a film for the fourth series of Sound on Film International. Although Stockhausen's music had been used for films previously (most notably, parts of Hymnen in Nicolas Roeg's Walkabout in 1971), {{this was the first}} time he had been asked to provide music specially for the purpose. He adapted 21 minutes of material taken from his electronic music for Freitag aus Licht, calling the result Zwei Paare (Two Couples), and the Brothers Quay created their animated film, which they titled In Absentia, based only on their reactions to the music and the simple suggestion that a window might be an idea to use [...] When, at a preview screening, Stockhausen saw the film, which shows a madwoman writing letters from a bleak asylum cell, he was moved to tears. The Brothers Quay were astonished to learn that his mother had been [...] "imprisoned by the Nazis in an asylum, where she later died. … This was a very moving moment for us as well, especially because <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> the film without knowing any of this" [...]|$|E

2500|$|Dixon {{had worked}} with Brian Higgins, of Xenomania, on her {{previous}} single, [...] "Knockdown", but it failed to enter the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, resulting in Dixon being dropped by her record label, Polydor Records. In early 2007, still with no recording contract, Dixon {{received a phone call}} from Higgins, who asked if she would like to continue working together. Dixon stated, [...] "The plan was to make the whole record with Brian without talking to any record labels, we were just going to wait until <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> something special and then approach people with a finished album." [...] However Dixon's profile was raised when she signed up to compete in Strictly Come Dancing, which she eventually won. Soon afterwards, Dixon signed a deal with Asylum Records. [...] "The Boy Does Nothing", by this time already written, was originally intended to be a jazz orientated track, but Dixon and Higgins decided to change the genre, incorporating mambo influences, due to her experience on Strictly Come Dancing. Dixon described the song as [...] "a very tongue-in-cheek record" [...] and Higgins likened the song to [...] "bottled happiness".|$|E
2500|$|Schieble {{gave birth}} to Jobs on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco and chose an adoptive couple for him that was [...] "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy." [...] The couple changed their mind, however, and decided to adopt a girl instead. The baby boy was then placed with the Bay Area blue collar couple Paul and Clara Jobs, neither of whom had a college education, and Schieble refused to sign the {{adoption}} papers. She then took the matter to court {{in an attempt to}} have her baby placed with a different family and only consented to releasing the baby to Paul and Clara after they promised that he would attend college. When Steve Jobs was in high school, his mother Clara admitted to his girlfriend, 17-year-old Chrisann Brennan, that she [...] "was too frightened to love [...] {{for the first six months}} of his life ... I was scared they were going to take him away from me. Even after we won the case, Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> a mistake. I wanted to return him." [...] When Chrisann shared his mother's comment with Steve, he stated that he was already aware of that and would later say he was deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara. Many years later, Steve Jobs's wife Laurene also noted that [...] "he felt he had been really blessed by having the two of them as parents." [...] Jobs would become upset when Paul and Clara were referred to as [...] "adoptive parents" [...] as they [...] "were my parents 1,000%." [...] With regard to his biological parents, Jobs referred to them as [...] "my sperm and egg bank. That's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more." [...] Jandali has also stated that [...] "I really am not his dad. Mr. and Mrs. Jobs are, as they raised him. And I don't want to take their place." ...|$|E

2500|$|James Cook led three {{separate}} voyages to chart unknown {{areas of the}} globe for the British Empire. It was on his third and final voyage that he encountered what is known today as the Islands of Hawaii. He first sighted the islands on 18 January 1778. [...] He anchored off {{the west coast of}} the island of Kauai near Waimea and met inhabitants to trade and obtain water and food. On 2 February 1778, Cook continued on to the coast of North America and Alaska searching for a Northwest Passage for approximately nine months. He returned to the island chain to resupply, initially exploring the coasts of Maui and the big island and trading with locals, then making anchor in Kealakekua Bay in January 1779. Cook and his crew was initially welcomed and treated with honor. He and his men were given much food, various gifts from the islands inhabitants. They were shown traditional native performances and ceremonies, and generally treated as privileged guests, as his arrival coincided with the Makahiki, a festival celebrating the yearly harvest while worshipping the Hawaiian deity Lono. However, after he and the crews of both ships, [...] and , left the islands, the festival season had ended and the season for battle and war had begun under the worship and rituals for Kūkaʻilimoku, the god of war. Although Cook's sequential visits may have coincided with native traditional seasons, the natives had soured on Cook and his men by the time of Cook's initial departure. John Ledyard was the only american aboard Cook's ship during this time and the only citizen aboard the ship not loyal to the crown. Ledyard was present during the events leading up to and during Cook's death, and wrote a detailed, neutral account of the events in his journals [...] During Cook's initial visit, he attempted to barter and forcibly stole the wood used to border the natives sacred [...] "Morai" [...] burial ground, used for high ranking individuals and depictions of their gods. Ledyard says in his journals, Cook offered two iron hatchets for the wooden border around the Morai and when the dismayed and insulted chiefs refused, Cook proceeded to give orders to ascend the Morai, break down the fence and load the boats with it. John Ledyard quotes in his journal: [...] "The poor dismayed chief's dreading his (Cook's) displeasure, which they saw approaching followed him upon the Morai to behold the fence that enclosed the mansions of their noble ancestors, and the images of their gods torn to pieces by a handful of rude strangers without the power, or at least without the resolution of opposing their sacrilegious depredations. When Cook had ascended the Morai he once more offered the hatchets to the chiefs. It was a very unequal price if the honest chiefs would have accepted of the bribe and Cook offered it only to evade the imputation of taking their property without payment." [...] [...] John Ledyard also tells of an episode where Captain Clerke accused a native chieftain friend of stealing the Resolution's jolly boat. The boat was soon found unstolen and the native chief soured from the false accusation. After staying in the bay for 19 days, Cook and his two ships sailed out of the bay. John Ledyard goes on to say in his journal: [...] "On the evening of the (January) 15th we struck our tents, and everything was taken on board, and it was very manifestly much to the satisfaction of the natives. A little after dark an old house that stood {{on the corner of the}} Morai took fire and burned down. This we supposed was occasioned by our people carelessly leaving their fire near it, but it was not the case. The natives burnt it themselves to show us the resentment they now entertained towards us, on account of our using it without their consent, and indeed manifestly against their consent. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> a sail loft of one part of it, and a hospital for our sick for the other part, though it was evidently esteemed by the natives as holy as the rest of the Morai, and ought to have been considered by us." [...] On the 6th of February Cook's ships unmoored and left Kealakekua bay. They were met with an unexpected hard gale which wrenched the mainmast of the Resolution. On February 11th, the Resolution again entered Kealakekua bay on the night of 13 February. [...] Ledyard quotes in his journal: [...] "Our return to this bay was as disagreeable to us as it was to the inhabitants, for we were reciprocally tired of each other. They had been oppressed and were weary of our prostituted alliance.....It was also equally evident from the looks of the natives as well as every other appearance that our friendship was at an end, and that we had nothing to do but to hasten our departure to some different island where our vices were not known, and where our intrinsic virtues might gain us another short space of being wondered at..." [...] While anchored in Kealakekua Bay, one of only two long boats (lifeboats used to ferry to/from ship/shore) was stolen by the Hawaiians, testing the foreigners' reaction to see how far they could go with such a significant loss. The Hawaiians had begun openly challenging the foreigners. In retaliation, and in an attempt to force good behavior on the natives, Cook attempted to kidnap the aliʻi nui of the island of Hawaii,Kalaniʻōpuʻu. Possibly being quite sick at this point, Cook made what were later described as a series of mistakes. The idea or suggestion that the Native Hawaiians considered Cook to be the God Lono himself is considered to be inaccurate and is attributed to William Bligh. It is possible that some Hawaiians may have used the name of Lono as a metaphor when describing Cook or other possible explanations other than Hawaiians mistaking the explorer for their own deity.|$|E
