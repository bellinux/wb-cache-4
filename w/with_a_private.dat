5|$|After this {{demonstration}} of power, AJ is promoted by his manager. A montage of AJ being promoted for doing absurd tasks follows. Soon, AJ is promoted to a rank <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> office. Danny and Morgan refuse {{to work for}} AJ further, finding him corrupt with power. AJ throws them out, and afterward he is promoted to CEO by a former officer—a decrepit man within a robotic business suit. AJ floats {{to the top of}} the suit, from which he spots a beach ball-destroying machine to the side. He hallucinates the beach balls as the heads of Morgan and Danny, who say that he has destroyed the spirit of summer. Realizing his mistake, AJ rejects the promotion. He returns to his friends outside, and together they plan the rest of their summer.|$|E
5|$|Born in Mayesville, South Carolina, {{to parents}} who had been slaves, she started working in fields with her family at age five. She took an early {{interest}} in becoming educated; {{with the help of}} benefactors, Bethune attended college hoping to become a missionary in Africa. She started a school for African-American girls in Daytona Beach, Florida. It later merged <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> institute for African-American boys, and was known as the Bethune-Cookman School. Bethune maintained high standards and promoted the school with tourists and donors, to demonstrate what educated African Americans could do. She was president of the college from 1923 to 1942, and 1946 to 1947. She {{was one of the few}} women in the world to serve as a college president at that time.|$|E

40|$|We examine firms' {{decisions}} to hire managers in a duopoly where a public firm competes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> foreign <b>private</b> firm. In {{contrast with the}} {{case in which the}} public firm competes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> domestic <b>private</b> firm -where only the private firm decides to hire a manager- we find that both firms hire managers. This leads to a social welfare higher than the one obtained when neither firm hires a manager. Mixed oligopoly...|$|R
5|$|Founded in 988 AD, the Mezhyhirya Monastery {{was one of}} {{the first}} monasteries {{established}} in the East Slavic state of Kievan Rus'. Throughout its existence, it was destroyed, and then restored numerous times, yet it was not spared destruction by Soviet authorities in 1935. At the time of its height, the Mezhyhirya Monastery was considered a spiritual center of Rus royal Rurikid house and later Cossacks. Currently, the area of the former monastery is located on a fenced-in woodland territory next to Novi Petrivtsi village and is directly connected <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> residence for Ukrainian government officials.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Diệm {{recalled}} him to Saigon to help {{deal with}} the Hòa Hảo, a religious sect equipped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> army. The Hòa Hảo was effectively an autonomous entity in the Mekong Delta, as its private army enforced a parallel administration and refused to integrate into the Saigon administration. While the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) General Dương Văn Minh led the military effort against the Hòa Hảo, Thơ helped to weaken the sect by buying off its warlords.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn {{probably}} {{made his first}} public concert appearance {{at the age of}} nine, when he participated in a chamber music concert accompanying a horn duo. He was also a prolific composer from an early age. As an adolescent, his works were often performed at home <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> orchestra for the associates of his wealthy parents amongst the intellectual elite of Berlin. Between the ages of 12 and 14, Mendelssohn wrote 12 string symphonies for such concerts, and a number of chamber works. He wrote his first published work, a piano quartet, {{by the time he was}} 13. It was probably Abraham Mendelssohn who procured the publication of Mendelssohn's early piano quartet by the house of Schlesinger. In 1824, the 15-year-old wrote his first symphony for full orchestra (in C minor, Op.11).|$|E

5|$|My father... was {{the richest}} man in Palestine. He marketed about ten percent of all the citrus crops sent from Palestine to Europe—especially to England and Germany. He owned a summer house in Marseilles, France, and another house in İskenderun, then in Syria and {{afterwards}} Turkey, and a number of houses in Palestine itself. Most of the time we lived in Jaffa. Our house had about twenty rooms, and we children would go down to swim in the sea. We also had stables with Arabian horses, and one of our homes in Ashkelon even had a large swimming pool. I think we must have been the only family in Palestine <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|The {{coming of}} the Yorkshire Dales Railway to Threshfield in 1902 opened up Hebden as a {{destination}} for day visitors and holiday makers. A purpose-built timber guest house was opened in 1909 {{at the south end}} of the village by the Co-operative Holiday Association, founded by Thomas Arthur Leonard. It passed into private hands in 1960, and continued as a holiday centre until 1990, mainly catering for school parties. It was demolished in 2016 and replaced <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> residence.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{the city}} and Amtrak {{attempted}} to fund a second renovation <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> partner, but plans fell through. In 1991, Amtrak constructed a rectangular concrete and glass station building {{on the north side}} of the tracks, in front of the passenger tunnel. Access from the south was blocked off. In 1999, the original station building was renovated at a cost of $7 million for use as commercial space. The front parking lot was expanded on a slope to the west; it covered much of the ground level (similar to the station before 1915). The mechanical building and the covered ramp to the trolley station were removed. A strip mall was built just to the east, with balustrades and archways referencing the historic station. The passageway from the subway station, long closed, was likely buried at this time. The 1901-built station building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 8, 1999.|$|E

5|$|Rich {{families}} from Rome usually {{had two or}} more houses, a townhouse (domus, plural domūs) {{and at least one}} luxury home (villa) outside the city. The domus was a privately owned single-family house, and might be furnished <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> bath (balneum), {{but it was not a}} place to retreat from public life. Although some neighbourhoods of Rome show a higher concentration of well-to-do houses, the rich did not live in segregated enclaves. Their houses were meant to be visible and accessible. The atrium served as a reception hall in which the paterfamilias (head of household) met with clients every morning, from wealthy friends to poorer dependents who received charity. It was also a centre of family religious rites, containing a shrine and the images of family ancestors. The houses were located on busy public roads, and ground-level spaces facing the street were often rented out as shops (tabernae). In addition to a kitchen garden—windowboxes might substitute in the insulae—townhouses typically enclosed a peristyle garden that brought a tract of nature, made orderly, within walls.|$|E
5|$|The Federation fleet try {{to destroy}} the Kukai base as {{it appears to be}} the source of the Song, but Wilhelm—who has been {{secretly}} observing events—arrives <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> fleet that destroys the Gnosis and protects the base. KOS-MOS then uses an advanced weapon to detect the Song's source in a cloaked spaceship. Boarding the spaceship, the group rescue MOMO and fight Albedo, but are stopped by a blue-cloaked man who allows Albedo to escape with a piece of data extracted from MOMO that could grant access to Miltia. Albedo then summons Proto Merkebah, a research ship created by Mizrahi to summon U-DO, and destroys the Federation fleet before aiming Proto Merkebah's weapons at Second Miltia's capital. The blue-cloaked man—revealed to be a resurrected Virgil—observes events before being summoned away. Shion's group infiltrates Proto Markebah and destroys its core while Albedo flees. Escaping Proto Merkebah as it self-destructs, KOS-MOS shields the damaged Elsa as it enters Second Miltia's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The Mumbai Police {{announced}} its move to put Raj under their custody on 13 February, which created an upsurge {{of violence in}} the state and led to two deaths. Attacks on North Indians were reported from Mumbai, Pune, Jalna, Beed, Aurangabad and Latur. Shops, offices and other business establishments were shut down in different parts of Mumbai, as MNS workers threatened violence in case their leader was arrested. Central Mumbai localities were most affected, especially around Dadar and Shivaji Park, the strongholds of both the MNS and the Shiv Sena. The police blocked roads in front of the residence of Raj in the Shivaji Park area. A civic activist named James John was assaulted by suspected MNS workers while he was attempting to photograph them forcing shop owners to down shutters in JB Nagar, Andheri. John suffered two rib fractures and bruises on his lungs. In Nashik, an employee of the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, a Maharashtrian, died during a stone pelting on state-run buses by MNS supporters. A migrant from Bihar, who was a security guard <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>private</b> company at Igatpuri in Nashik district, was killed by a mob.|$|E

50|$|He {{enlisted in}} the {{regiment}} as <b>a</b> <b>private</b> in Company D {{so that he could}} be promoted chaplain when recruitment was complete. The last four companies of the regiment did not fill quickly, however, and his official promotion was significantly delayed. He served as acting chaplain but <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>private's</b> pay before promoted. White claimed to be willing to serve as <b>a</b> <b>private</b> should his elevation to chaplain be denied, but his writing expressed a sense of superiority over other privates in the regiment, and it is unlikely that he performed ordinary duties as <b>a</b> <b>private,</b> and was still active as a recruiter for that time. While still <b>a</b> <b>private,</b> the regiment left Indianapolis on April 24, 1864 for Washington DC. White continued to advocate for his promotion to the chaplaincy of the 28th USCT and wrote another letter to Seward about this time.|$|R
