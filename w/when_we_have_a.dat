500|$|In {{casting the}} first series of Holby City, Young—who had {{previously}} {{worked on the}} soap operas Brookside and Family Affairs—selected actors who were already established names in the acting industry, particularly from a soap opera background. French had starred in the BBC's EastEnders, while Stephenson and Faulkner had starred in Brookside. Griffin had also appeared in ITV's Coronation Street. Young explained: [...] "Some of the best performances on screen {{have come out of}} soaps in the past few years. There is a fantastic amount of talent on those shows." [...] This propensity for hiring established actors continued as the soap progressed, with former Brookside actress Patricia Potter cast as registrar Diane Lloyd, Star Wars actor Denis Lawson cast as consultant Tom Campbell-Gore, and Family Affairs star Rocky Marshall cast as SHO Ed Keating. Later roles were awarded to comedian Adrian Edmondson, former film actress Patsy Kensit, and Jesus of Nazareth star Powell. When Jane Asher was cast in the recurring role of Lady Byrne in 2007, Inside Soap magazine asked Kyle whether the production team intentionally sought out [...] "well-known-names".

[...] After the reveal of multiple release dates for films through 2019 in July 2014, Feige stated, [...] "I think if you look at some of those dates that we've announced, we're going to three in a few of those years. Again, not because there's a number cruncher telling us to go to three, do more than two pictures a year, but because of the very reason just laid out: it is about managing [...] franchises, film to film, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> team ready to go, why tell them to go away for four years just because we don't have a slot? We'd rather find a way to keep that going." [...] After the titles were revealed in October 2014, Feige said, [...] "The studio's firing on all cylinders right now ... which made us comfortable for the first time ... to increase to three films a year [...] instead of just two, without changing our methods." ...|$|E

The extra 6,400 cycle steals per second added the equivalent of 13% load, leaving just enough time for all scheduled tasks to run to completion. Five minutes into the descent, Buzz Aldrin gave the computer the command 1668 which instructed it to calculate and display DELTAH (the difference between altitude sensed by the radar and the computed altitude). This added an additional 10% to the processor workload, causing executive overflow and a 1202 alarm.

2500|$|The LTTE was a self-styled {{national}} liberation organization {{with the primary}} goal of establishing an independent Tamil state. Tamil nationalism was the primary basis of its ideology. The LTTE was influenced by Indian freedom fighters such as Subhas Chandra Bose. The organization denied being a separatist movement and saw itself as fighting for self-determination and restoration of sovereignty in what it recognized as its homeland. Although most Tigers were Hindus, the LTTE was an avowedly secular organization; religion did not play any significant part in its ideology. Leader Velupillai Prabhakaran criticized what he saw as the oppressive features of traditional Hindu Tamil society, such as the caste system and gender inequality. The LTTE presented itself as a revolutionary movement seeking widespread change within Tamil society, not just independence from the Sri Lankan state. Therefore, its ideology called for the removal of caste discrimination and support for women's liberation. Prabhakaran described his political philosophy as [...] "revolutionary socialism", with the goal of creating an [...] "egalitarian society". When asked about the LTTE's economic policy, Velupillai Pirabaharan [...] said an [...] "open market economy." [...] But he pointed out that: [...] "We can only think about a proper economic structure when the ethnic problem is resolved. ...

2500|$|Gonet is an {{established}} actress in British television, {{known for her}} role in the 1990s BBC series The House of Eliott. Her casting as Jayne follows a trend of Holby City producers towards hiring established British actors - with Gonet joining a series 9 cast alongside former film actress Patsy Kensit as Ward Sister Faye Morton, comedian Adrian Edmondson as Consultant Surgeon Abra Durant and Jesus of Nazareth star Robert Powell as Nursing Consultant Mark Williams. Series creator Mal Young commented on the preference for established names when discussing Holby Citys inception, explaining: [...] "Soap actors are the best actors. There’s been so much snobbery before. The whole thing about typecasting was probably invented by actors who couldn’t get other work. From day one I knew I wanted to put on screen people that viewers want to watch. There’s no downside to that." [...] Series producer Diana Kyle also addressed this trend in November 2007, when asked: [...] "When you cast an actor, do you actively seek out well-known names - like Jane Asher (Lady Byrne) and Patsy Kensit (Faye) - or will a role simply go to whoever's better suited?". She responded to this question: [...] "It's lovely <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them.

2500|$|On 28 November, in an {{interview}} with TIME magazine [...] Morsi said of his 22 November constitutional declaration: [...] "If we had a constitution, then all of what I have said or done last week, will stop.... <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> constitution, what I have issued will stop immediately.... The Constituent Assembly of Egypt rushed to finish its work amid widespread protests against Morsi and his declaration. The rush toward a new constitution spurred a walkout among its drafters, i.e. liberals, human rights activists, and others who were unsatisfied with a range of provisions dealing with {{the role of religion in}} the state, the status of women, and the privileges accorded to the country's army. According to the BBC's Jon Leybe the move was designed to preempt a ruling by Egypt's Supreme Constitutional Court on 2 December, which might once again dissolve the assembly. The Brotherhood hoped that the decree replaced by a completely new constitution would be approved on a referendum and put an end to the unrest. Low-level rallies continued in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Wednesday. Dozens of police officers, backed by trucks firing tear gas, arrested numerous protesters, some of whom were beaten by officers as others continued to throw stones at police. The Brotherhood organized counter-demonstrations, including one in Egypt's second city, Alexandria, which attracted a few thousand participants. As protests mounted over Morsi's decision to grant himself sweeping powers until the text of the constitution was ratified in a referendum, the panel tasked with writing the constitution wrapped up its deliberations on Wednesday and readied for a vote on Thursday. By 28 November two more people were killed and hundreds more injured. Egypt Independent reported that one of the dead was Fathy Ghareeb, a founder of the Socialist Popular Alliance Party, who died by suffocation caused by the tear gas fired by the Central Security Forces (CSF) in Tahrir Square. Egypt's Court of Cassation, the country's highest appeals court, the Cairo Appeals Court, and other appeals courts suspended their work until Morsi's decree is rescinded.|$|E
