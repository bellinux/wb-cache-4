5|$|Specialised {{football}} boots {{began to emerge}} in the professional era, taking the place of everyday shoes or <b>work</b> <b>boots.</b> Players initially simply nailed strips of leather to their boots to enhance their grip, leading the Football Association to rule in 1863 that no nails could project from boots. By the 1880s these crude attachments had become studs. Boots of this era were made of heavy leather, had hard toecaps, and came high above a player's ankles.|$|E

25|$|Many North American {{hardcore}} punk fans {{adopted a}} dressed-down style of T-shirts, jeans, combat boots or sneakers and crewcut-style haircuts. Women in the hardcore scene typically wore army pants, band T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts. The clothing style was {{a reflection of}} hardcore ideology, which included dissatisfaction with suburban America and the hypocrisy of American culture. It was essentially deconstruction of American fashion staples—ripped jeans, holey T-shirts, torn stockings for women, and <b>work</b> <b>boots.</b> The style of the 1980s hardcore scene contrasted with the more provocative fashion styles of late 1970s punk rockers (elaborate hairdos, torn clothes, patches, safety pins, studs, spikes, etc.).|$|E

40|$|Well-fitted {{footwear}} {{provides an}} appropriate level of protection, support and comfort during walking (de Castro et al., 2010), {{and reduces the}} potential for foot problems and foot pain (Manna et al., 2001). To fit properly, the internal footwear shape should match {{the shape of a}} wearer 2 ̆ 7 s foot. In underground coal miners, however, there are mismatches between the shape of their feet and the internal <b>work</b> <b>boot</b> dimensions. The impact these boot-foot mismatches have on work footwear satisfaction remains unclear (Dobson et al., 2017). Uncomfortable footwear does not have poor fit ratings at every point on a shoe. This indicates that <b>work</b> <b>boot</b> fit might be more important at some areas of the foot rather than others (Au 2 ̆ 6 Goonetilleke, 2007), although this notion remains unexplored...|$|R
25|$|Freddy Krueger's {{physical}} appearance has remained largely consistent throughout the film series, although minor {{changes were made}} in subsequent films. He wears a striped red-and-green sweater (solid red sleeves in the original film), a dark brown fedora, his bladed glove, loose black trousers (brown in the original film), and worn <b>work</b> <b>boots,</b> {{in keeping with his}} blue collar background. His skin is scarred and burned as a result of being burned alive by the parents of Springwood, and he has no hair at all on his head as it presumably all burned off. In the original film, only Freddy's face was burned, while the scars have spread to the rest of his body from the second film onwards. His blood is occasionally a dark, oily color, or greenish in hue when he is in the Dreamworld. In the original film, Freddy remains in the shadows and under lower light much longer than he does in the later pictures. In the second film, there are some scenes where Freddy is shown without his bladed glove, and instead with the blades protruding from the tips of his fingers. As the films began to emphasize the comedic, wise-cracking aspect of the character, he began to don various costumes and take on other forms, such as dressing as a waiter or wearing a Superman inspired version of his sweater with a cape (The Dream Child), appearing as a video game sprite (Freddy's Dead), a giant snake-like creature (Dream Warriors), and a hookah smoking caterpillar (Freddy vs. Jason).|$|E

He was {{the embodiment of the}} spirit of the poorer parts of London, wearing shabby, ill-fitting clothes, old <b>work</b> <b>boots</b> and a frayed top hat. One critic noted [...] "Like music hall itself, Harry Champion was of the people, he expressed the tastes of practically all his listeners, even those who would not openly admit it, and in World War 2 he sang to troops who found him a splendid tonic".|$|E
40|$|Safety {{boots are}} {{compulsory}} in many occupations {{to protect the}} feet of workers from undesirable external stimuli, particularly in harsh work environments. The unique environmental conditions and varying tasks performed in different occupations necessitate a variety of boot designs to match each worker 2 ̆ 7 s occupational safety and functional requirements. Unfortunately, safety boots are often designed more for occupational safety {{at the expense of}} functionality and comfort. In fact, there is a paucity of published research investigating the influence that specific variations in <b>work</b> <b>boot</b> design have on fundamental tasks common to many occupations, such as walking. This literature review aimed to collate and examine what is currently known about the influence of boot design on walking in order to identify gaps in the literature and develop evidence-based recommendations upon which to design future research studies investigating <b>work</b> <b>boot</b> design...|$|R

At {{the back of the}} store, they had a wall of TVs which were all tuned to MTV. Knopfler said there was a man working there dressed in a baseball cap, <b>work</b> <b>boots,</b> and a checkered shirt delivering boxes who was standing next to him watching. As they were standing there watching MTV, Knopfler remembers the man coming up with lines such as [...] "what are those, Hawaiian noises?...that ain't workin'," [...] etc. Knopfler asked for a pen to write some of these lines down and then eventually put those words to music.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "hip-pop" [...] era {{also saw}} the split {{between male and female}} hip hop fashion, which had {{previously}} been more or less similar. Women in hip hop had emulated the male tough-guy fashions such as baggy pants, [...] "Loc" [...] sunglasses, tough looks and heavy workboots; many, such as Da Brat, accomplished this with little more than some lip gloss and a bit of make-up to make the industrial work pants and <b>work</b> <b>boots</b> feminine. The female performers who completely turned the tide such as Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown popularized glamorous, high-fashion feminine hip hop styles, such as Kimora Lee Simmons fashion line of Baby Phat. While Lauryn Hill and Eve popularized more conservative styles that still maintained both a distinctly feminine and distinctly hip hop feel.|$|E
50|$|Over-the-knee boots (or cuissardes, {{which include}} thighboots, top boots, hip-boots, and waders) are long boots that fully or partly cover the knee. Originally {{created as a}} man's riding boot in the 15th century, {{in the latter part}} of the 20th century, the style was redefined as a fashion boot for women. Over-the-knee boots are also used as a <b>work</b> <b>boot</b> in {{circumstances}} requiring additional protection for the legs (e.g. fishing waders).|$|R
5000|$|Modeled after a <b>work</b> <b>boot,</b> {{the house}} was built by shoe {{salesman}} Mahlon Haines in 1948 {{as a form of}} advertisement. His shoe business claimed it made shoes [...] "from hoof to hoof" [...] because the company began the process with raising the cattle. The house, which is 25 ft tall and contains five stories, was once rented out to couples, and is now open for public tours. It is located on Shoe House Road, next to a shoe-shaped doghouse. Haines requested the design by handing a <b>work</b> <b>boot</b> to an architect and saying, [...] "Build me a house like this." [...] The living room is located in the toe, the kitchen is located in the heel, two bedrooms are located in the ankle, and an ice cream shop is located in the instep. There is also a stained glass panel that shows Mahlon holding a pair of shoes with a message below it that reads, [...] "Haines the Shoe Wizard". Fire escapes were added in the 1960s.|$|R
40|$|Maintaining {{postural}} {{stability is}} crucial, especially in hazardous occupational environments. The {{purpose of the}} study was to assess the role of three occupational footwear (low top shoe (LT); tactical <b>work</b> <b>boot</b> (TB) and steel-toed <b>work</b> <b>boot</b> (WB)) on postural stability when exposed to an occupational workload (4 -h) involving standing/walking using the sensory organization test (SOT) equilibrium (EQ) scores and comparing current results with previously published postural sway variables from the same study. Fourteen male adults were tested on three separate days wearing a randomized occupational footwear, at the beginning (pre) and every 30 min of the 4 -h workload until 240 th min. SOT EQ scores were analyzed using a 3 × 9 repeated measures analysis of variance at an alpha level of 0. 05. Significant differences between footwear was found in eyes open (p = 0. 03) and eyes closed (p = 0. 001) conditions. Pairwise comparisons revealed that LT had significantly lower postural stability compared to TB and WB. No other significant differences were found between footwear and over time. Significant differences between footwear can be attributed to design characteristics of footwear. Lack of significant differences over time suggests that, even though the average EQ scores decreased during the workload implying less postural stability, SOT EQ scores alone may not be sufficient to detect postural stability changes over the 4 -h workload...|$|R
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 60s, {{the hard}} mods had become known as skinheads, who, in their early days, would be known for the same love of soul, rocksteady and early reggae. [...] Because of their fascination with black culture, the early skinheads were, except in {{isolated}} situations, largely devoid of the overt racism and fascism that would later become associated with whole wings of the movement in the mid to late 70s. The early skinheads retained basic elements of mod fashion—such as Fred Perry and Ben Sherman shirts, Sta-Prest trousers and Levi's jeans—but mixed them with working class-oriented accessories such as braces and Dr. Martens <b>work</b> <b>boots.</b> Hebdige claims that as early as the Margate and Brighton brawls between mods and rockers, some mods were seen wearing boots and braces and sporting close cropped haircuts (for practical reasons, as long hair was a liability in industrial jobs and street fights).|$|E
2500|$|Superboy is a {{principal}} character in the Young Justice animated series, voiced by Nolan North. He {{has been referred to}} as the [...] "breakout character" [...] of the show by its producers and is the only member of Young Justice from the comics to appear {{as a member of the}} team in the first season, with other characters either appearing or joining next season. He first wore a white form-fitting solar suit and later wears a black T-shirt with the Superman logo across his chest and blue army-type pants with brown <b>work</b> <b>boots.</b> The result of Project Cadmus' [...] "Project Kr" [...] in the two-part pilot [...] "Independence Day", Superboy is a sixteen-week-old genomorph clone of Superman, created as a living weapon by Project Cadmus and Dr. Mark Desmond to either replace Superman if he falls or destroy him should he go rogue. Kept in a pod beneath the Cadmus facility, he was telepathically force-fed advanced knowledge in various areas including languages, history, math, reading, writing, culture, etc. While he possesses Superman's super strength, enhanced speed, telescopic vision, infrared vision, super hearing, and invulnerability, these powers are not at Superman's level, nor at the proportionate level for a Kryptonian of his physical age. In addition, he lacks Superman's more advanced powers such as flight, x-ray and heat vision, due to missing sequences in Superboy's Kryptonian DNA being bridged with human DNA, which stabilizes Superboy and withholds full Kryptonian powers. After being released by Aqualad, Robin, and Kid Flash, defeating the transformed Desmond (a.k.a. Blockbuster) and the Justice League's arrival, Superboy meets Superman, who has since found it uncomfortable being around his clone, and Superboy's failed attempts to work with and talk to Superman make Superboy angry and irrational. He has a burgeoning romantic relationship with Martian Manhunter's niece, M'gann. In [...] "Targets", Superboy is given the name [...] "Conner Kent"; the first name suggested by M'gann after the love interest of a sitcom titled [...] "Hello Megan" [...] whom he greatly resembles; and the surname by Martian Manhunter after Superman, which Miss Martian thought was in homage to Doctor Fate (Kent Nelson). At the end of [...] "Terrors", he kisses Miss Martian after Killer Frost had almost killed her. Since then, the two have started a romantic relationship, but attempted to keep it from their teammates, showing their affection in privacy or speaking telepathically. In [...] "Agendas", Superboy learns that he is the half-human clone of Lex Luthor, who gives him Shield-shaped patches to defeat the Superclone Match. Afterwards, Lex tells him the shields are a gift [...] "from a father to his son" [...] and quotes [...] "Red Sun" [...] to incapacitate Superboy when he tries to attack him. In [...] "Performance", Superboy displays signs of addiction to the [...] "shields", using them continuously in the field, but making him more aggressive when fighting Parasite. In [...] "Usual Suspects", Superboy confesses this to the Team, and agrees to meet Luthor on Santa Prisco for a restock on the [...] "shields". Upon arriving, Miss Martian and Artemis also appear to find Lex Luthor accompanied by Queen Bee, Bane, Blockbuster, Cheshire, and Sportsmaster. However the villains are surprised and attacked by them and the rest of the Team, as the [...] "Red Sun" [...] program has been wiped from his mind by Miss Martian. Luthor admits that no other programs were installed in time by Dr. Desmond. In [...] "Auld Acquaintance", he and Superman finally interact and reveal their civilian identities to one another. In the five-year gap, Superboy remained with the team sporting a long-sleeved Superman T-shirt, but retaining his appearance from season one, due to being force grown. He is now more relaxed, controlled, and makes use of strategy and technology in battles. In the episode [...] "Alienated", his relationship with Superman has visibly improved. Kal-El refers to Superboy as his little brother with the Kryptonian name Kon-El. At some point, he ended his relationship with Miss Martian in part because he does not outwardly age, but also because of her violent probing of hostile minds, leaving them in a catatonic state. Worse, she attempted to erase his memory of this argument. M'gann is shocked out of her ways after she telepathically attacks Aqualad, and eventually breaks up with Lagoon Boy, deciding with Connor to renew their relationship.|$|E
