500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "In the Middle" [...] was {{directed}} by Matthew Rolston, who directed the video for the group's previous single [...] "Hole in the Head". It was filmed at Pinewood Studios, London in February 2004. The photography was completed by Martin Ahlgren. Buchanan refrained from revealing details about the video before its release, saying: [...] "The shoot went very well but what actually happens in the video is being kept a secret until it's shown. We’re all really excited and can't <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> what our fans think about it!" [...] It aired on the Sugababes' official website, and on television, on 20 February 2004 and was included on the single's CD release.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the album was {{revealed}} through the 'Smoking Section' of Rolling Stone magazine on February 2, 2009, where it was also announced that a music video would be filmed for the track [...] "I Want to Kill You Like They Do in the Movies". Throughout March, five rough mixes of songs from the album were leaked. In {{an interview with a}} fansite, Chris Vrenna said of the leak: [...] "I hate stealing of music in any form. If a band chooses to put tracks online, that's great. [...] I think true fans know that usually songs found online before the record is released are rough mixes, and will <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the music the way the artist intended." [...] "We're from America" [...] was released as a free download on the band's website from March 27, with a one-track digital single released through online retailers on April 7. A CD single was released on April 14, and was exclusively sold at Hot Topic. It peaked at number three on Billboards Hot Singles Sales, spending six weeks on the chart.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its release, [...] "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" [...] was the subject of {{controversy}} with the Asian community, as well as comedian Margaret Cho. In the film Full Metal Jacket, an Asian prostitute approaches US troops and offers to engage in lewd conduct in exchange for money. She uses terms such as [...] "Me so horny" [...] and [...] "me love you long time", which were heavily parodied and popularized. Accordingly, those terms have been used as humor at the expense of Asian people, and have been described as [...] "racial slurs" [...] by Cho. Other female acts have been known to use the phrase, such as Fergie on her track [...] "London Bridge" [...] (2006), and Nelly Furtado in [...] "Maneater" [...] (2006). In an interview with MTV News, Cho retracted her earlier comments, and expressed how if used in song, and by a female then it wouldn't be offensive: [...] "I don't mind it when it's used in songs, like when women use it," [...] Cho continued. [...] "Fergie uses it, that doesn't bother me. But when it's shouted in the street and they don't <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the response? What if I was actually going to go, 'Oh, OK'? They never stick around to hear the answer." ...|$|E

500|$|Rosie O'Donnell reacted {{negatively}} to Fink's casting and first solo musical performance. In {{an interview with}} Access Hollywood, she deemed her rendition of [...] "I Know What Boys Like" [...] underwhelming, and stated that it failed to meet her expectations. She called Lauren [...] "so unlikable," [...] and questioned why the producers had not cast a [...] "pretty heavy girl". Fink brushed off O'Donnell's comments. O'Donnell later apologized, and said, [...] "Oh, Ashley – I love your swagger – your acting – your face – your heart – as a famous fat person – I am often asked about the issue… I love the story line – I love the show – and if in any way something I said hurt you – I apologize MORE. You are so talented, and I can't <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> you belt it…as I know you can—the often misquoted Rosie." [...] Fink was defended by Justin Thompson of Socialite Life, who commented: [...] "I've loved her character and how they've developed her and she's just {{become a source of}} great comedy – is that because she's full-figured? No. Is it because her character is well-written? Yes. It’s kind of sad to see Rosie lambaste what the show is trying to do." ...|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery from MTV {{commented that}} [...] "Gaga {{has created a}} world that, while oppressive, also looks great." [...] In a {{separate}} piece Montgomery added that [...] "... she may have finally reached the point in her career where not even she can top herself." [...] Rolling Stones Daniel Kreps called the video a [...] "cinematic epic." [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly, liked the video; however, {{he had no idea}} what was going on: [...] "I can’t <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Lady Gaga explain her latest video, “Alejandro.” Mostly because after watching it (twice!), I have absolutely no clue what’s going on beyond the obvious." [...] Anthony Benigno from Daily News felt that [...] "the shock songstress' new music video [...] is chock full of bed-ridden S imagery that makes it look like the softcore answer to The Matrix. Randall Roberts from Los Angeles Times said [...] "the clip reinforces the notion that no one understands the convergence of image and music right now better than Gaga." [...] Jed Gottlieb from the Boston Herald said that [...] "The plot [...] is hard to decipher, but it’s clearly not a story that ends happily ever after." [...] Jen Dose from National Post commented [...] "Gaga’s new vid for 'Alejandro' certainly brings the crazy we’ve all come to expect from her. It’s like an 8+ minute homage to Madonna—with some gay Nazis thrown in for good measure". Amy Odell of New York said the video's outfits were not as [...] "intense" [...] as those of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] or [...] "Telephone." [...] Nate Jones of Time Magazine disliked the song, but felt the video [...] "looks fantastic... the self-conscious ballsiness of Gaga and director Steven Klein works here." [...] Jennifer Cady from E! liked the video, but did not think it was as good as Gaga's previous work. Julie Moult from Daily Mail said [...] ", no-one could accuse Lady Gaga of being the shy and retiring type." ...|$|E
2500|$|BP {{decided to}} restructure its Australian {{operations}} and on 15 December 1969 {{wrote to the}} Shire of Hastings stating [...] "I hope I may assume {{that there will be}} no difficulty over transferring" [...] the rights and privileges including the Rating Agreement to BP Australia Ltd. That the Rating Agreement would transfer was apparently so obvious to BP that it did not <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the position of the Shire of Hastings before transferring the assets to BP Australia Ltd. Under the Rating Agreement the rates would have been $50,000 however the Shire of Hastings said the Rating Agreement no longer applied and assessed the rates in excess of $150,000.|$|E

2500|$|The {{suspects}} were charged {{and brought to}} trial in September 1935, the Crown alleging that they conspired together to kill Mr John Neilson. [...] A short time into the trial, before the prosecution could complete their case, there was a dramatic turn of events when the jury indicated they {{did not wish to}} continue, as 'the evidence was not good enough to convict the accused'. The prosecutor appealed to the jury to <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> more witness and police testimony. However, after taking {{no more than a few}} seconds to consider the request, the jury members agreed there was no point continuing. Consequently, the judge acquitted both the accused and allowed them to go free.|$|E
