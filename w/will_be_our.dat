500|$|No. 80 Wing {{had begun}} {{transferring}} to the Dutch East Indies in December 1944, {{and the main}} body followed in January 1945. Gibbes' injuries prevented him from joining the formation at its base on Morotai, where it came {{under the control of}} the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), until 9March. Once there, he took over as temporary commanding officer for a few days when Caldwell was called to Manila. In April, Gibbes was one of eight senior pilots, including Caldwell and fellow aces Wilf Arthur and John Waddy, who tendered their resignations in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground-attack missions. The incident became known as the [...] "Morotai Mutiny". Gibbes later declared that [...] "...after I myself had been operating for a week or so and had a really good look around and seen the futility of the operations which had been given, I could not see any point in carrying on. I certainly lost all keenness for remaining in the service." [...] As a former jackaroo, he was especially upset about one sortie that involved attacking cattle: [...] "I felt horrible about it, being an ex bushy...at about lunch time I went out and darned if I didn't have to turn butcher. And Heavens, it was butchering too, in every sense of the word. No—not the Japs. Cattle...If we are to get the Japs out of this area without loss of human lives, starvation <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>our</b> main weapon...God, I hated doing it but could do nothing else. Felt as sick as hell." [...] No action was taken against the [...] "mutineers" [...] for their attempted resignations; a subsequent government inquiry found that their protest was justified. In the meantime, Gibbes and Caldwell were court martialled for their involvement in alcohol trafficking on Morotai. Both were reduced to the rank of flight lieutenant; the Air Officer Commanding No.1 TAF, Air Commodore Harry Cobby, himself shortly to be dismissed over the [...] "mutiny", restored Gibbes to squadron leader effective [...] 23April.|$|E

[...] He has been described as [...] "a modern-era, media-savvy scientist with the right amounts of showmanship, populist sensibility, and disregard for the normal avenues of scientific prestige required to pull this off". The debut in [...] "an astonishingly slick, multi-component media package" [...] required exceptional coordination between networks, museums, producers and scientists while maintaining a level of secrecy which is hard to attain in modern circumstances. In interviews published on 27 May, Hurum stated that it was good that they had got the message out that primates were rooted deep in time, but that some of the slogans were too much and the publicity got completely out of control. He disclosed that he paid nearly $750,000 (£465,000) for the specimen, but felt it was worthwhile to make the fossil available for scientific investigation instead of it being bought by a private collector and hidden away. Others including Chris Beard were concerned that the price and publicity could lead to profiteering by amateur collectors, and make acquisition of specimens for research purposes more difficult.|$|E
