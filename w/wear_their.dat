5|$|As both Manchester United and Bayern Munich {{traditionally}} wore red {{as their}} primary kit colour, UEFA regulations would normally have required both teams to <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> change kits. However, the two clubs felt {{it would have been}} a shame for neither to <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> traditional colours, and they agreed to toss a coin to see who would have first choice. Manchester United won the toss and therefore wore their usual European colours of red shirts, white shorts and white socks, while Bayern wore silver shirts, shorts and socks, all with maroon trim.|$|E

5|$|Clan chiefs may <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> crest simpliciter, that {{is without}} being encircled by the motto {{and without any}} feathers. It is more common, however, for a clan chiefs to <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their motto or slogan (pictured left). The chief's crest badge does not contain the strap and buckle that other clan members are permitted to wear. Clan chiefs are also entitled to wear three eagle feathers behind the circlet of their crest badge. On certain occasions, such as clan gatherings, it may be appropriate to use real eagle feathers. Clan chiefs that {{are members of the}} British Peerage or a feudal baron are entitled to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge, though {{this is a matter of}} personal preference.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, the 27-year-old Rimsky-Korsakov became Professor of Practical Composition and Instrumentation (orchestration) at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, as well {{as leader}} of the Orchestra Class.

Transgender personnel are also permitted to serve in the ADF, and are provided with support when necessary.

5|$|Wear of the {{insignia}} is {{according to}} guidelines {{issued by the}} Chancellery of Honours, which stipulate that the badges be worn before most other national orders—that is, {{at the end of}} an individual's medal bar closest to the centre of the chest or at the wearer's neck—with only the Victoria Cross, the Cross of Valour, and the badge of the Order of Merit permitted to be worn before the badges of the Order of Canada. Those in the grades of Companion or Officer may <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> badges on a neck ribbon, while those in the Member group display their insignia suspended by a ribbon from a medal bar on the left chest. Protocol originally followed the British tradition, wherein female appointees wore their Order of Canada emblem on a ribbon bow positioned on the left shoulder. These regulations were altered in 1997, and women may <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> insignia in either the traditional manner or in the same fashion as the men.|$|E

5|$|Armigers, like clan {{chiefs and}} chieftains, may <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed {{with their own}} motto or slogan. Armigers are permitted to wear one silver eagle feather behind the circlet (or on certain occasions a real eagle feather). If an Armiger {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge. If an Armiger is a member of a Scottish clan he or she may wear the crest badge of their chief, however it must be encircled by a strap and buckle (see Un-armigerous clan members below).|$|E
5|$|For the regiment, {{expansion}} {{was on a}} {{more modest}} scale {{than that of the}} Great War. Ten battalions (see List of battalions of the King's Regiment (Liverpool)) were formed between 1939 and 1940, including the reconstituted 8th (Liverpool Irish) Battalion. Two of the battalions converted to armour and anti-air roles in 1941: the 11th became the 152nd Regiment in the Royal Armoured Corps, but continued to <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> King's Regiment cap badge on the black beret of the RAC, as did all infantry units converted in this way, while the 12th transferred to the Royal Artillery as 101st Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the tournament, Homer threatens Bart to win {{no matter}} what. In an {{extremely}} close match, Bart and Todd each do well, and tie by the time they reach the eighteenth hole. Bart and Todd agree that the competition is not worth the stress, that they are equally good and that they should call it a draw, splitting the award evenly. As a result, Ned and Homer are forced to <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> respective wives' Sunday dresses and mow each other's lawn. People around the neighborhood laugh at them and Ned actually enjoys it (commenting that it reminds him of his fraternity days in college), much to Homer's dismay.|$|E

5|$|Springbok colours {{are only}} awarded to South Africans. Australian Eddie Jones, {{who worked as}} a {{technical}} advisor to South Africa for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, was not allowed to be issued with Springbok colours as a non-South African and was obliged to wear a South Africa tracksuit when pitchside. Following South Africa's victory in the Rugby World Cup, all players and coaching team members were expected to <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> Springbok colours to the post-tournament awards dinner. In protest at Jones not being issued with colours, Bryan Habana gave Jones his Springbok colours and the team attended the awards dinner in suits instead of in Springbok colours.|$|E
5|$|The Aggie Band {{is unique}} among college bands; no other band eats and lives {{together}} as a military unit, even at the Service Academies and military colleges. Bandsmen <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> cadet uniforms to class, drill, meetings, and other functions on campus. As a requested component of football away games, they perform at more football games than any other band. As of 1993, the band performed at 125 of the last 131 football games, including a streak of 42 straight from 1981 to 1984. Demand is extremely high for the band and one person, upon finding out the Aggie Band would not be performing at the local football game versus A, returned and requested a refund for 40 tickets.|$|E
5|$|The manager, or {{head coach}} of a team, oversees the team's major {{strategic}} decisions, such as establishing the starting rotation, setting the lineup, or batting order, before each game, and making substitutions during games—in particular, bringing in relief pitchers. Managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches; they may have specialized responsibilities, such as working with players on hitting, fielding, pitching, or strength and conditioning. At most levels of organized play, two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat: the first base coach and third base coach, occupying designated coaches' boxes just outside the foul lines, assist {{in the direction of}} baserunners when the ball is in play, and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners during pauses in play. In contrast to many other team sports, baseball managers and coaches generally <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> team's uniforms; coaches must be in uniform in order to be allowed on the field to confer with players during a game.|$|E

5|$|Clan chieftains, like clan chiefs, may <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed {{with their own}} motto or slogan. Clan chieftains may also wear two small eagle feathers (unlike the chief's three). On certain occasions real eagle feathers may be worn behind the crest badge. If a clan chieftain {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge. Recently feudal barons have taken to wearing two eagle feathers behind their armiger's badge but there is no ancient tradition of this and it is solely based upon the fact that anciently feudal barons were most likely to have been chiefs or chieftains. If the feudal baron is a member of a clan it is advisable to consult the clan chief on clan customs and traditions. The Lord Lyon only gives guidance and not governance on the wearing of feathers and recommends consulting with a clan chief who approves the number of feathers worn by members of the clan.|$|E
5|$|Since the Second World War, most {{but not all}} Commonwealth {{countries}} have created their own honours systems and no longer participate in the British honours system. This began soon after the Partition of India in 1947, when the new countries of India and Pakistan introduced their own systems of awards. The VC {{was replaced by the}} Param Vir Chakra (PVC) and Nishan-e-Haider (NH) respectively. Most if not all new honours systems continued to permit recipients of British honours to <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> awards according to the rules of each nation's order of wear. Sri Lanka, whose defence personnel were eligible to receive the Victoria Cross until 1972, introduced its own equivalent, the Parama Weera Vibhushanaya medal. Three Commonwealth realms—Australia, Canada and New Zealand—have each introduced their own decorations for gallantry and bravery, replacing British decorations such as the Victoria Cross with their own. The only Commonwealth countries that still can recommend the VC are the small nations, none of whose forces have ever been awarded the VC, that still participate in the British honours system.|$|E
5|$|The Tang {{capital was}} the largest {{city in the world}} at its time, the {{population}} of the city wards and its suburban countryside reaching 2 million inhabitants. The Tang capital was very cosmopolitan, with ethnicities of Persia, Central Asia, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Tibet, India, and many other places living within. Naturally, with this plethora of different ethnicities living in Chang'an, there were also many different practiced religions, such as Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and Islam being practiced within. With widely open access to China that the Silk Road to the west facilitated, many foreign settlers were able to move east to China, while the city of Chang'an itself had about 25,000 foreigners living within. Exotic green-eyed, blonde-haired Tocharian ladies serving wine in agate and amber cups, singing, and dancing at taverns attracted customers. If a foreigner in China pursued a Chinese woman for marriage, he was required to stay in China and was unable to take his bride back to his homeland, as stated in a law passed in 628 to protect women from temporary marriages with foreign envoys. Several laws enforcing segregation of foreigners from Chinese were passed during the Tang dynasty. In 779 the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced Uighurs in the capital, Chang'an, to <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> ethnic dress, stopped them from marrying Chinese females, and banned them from passing off as Chinese.|$|E
50|$|In {{the ongoing}} tour, {{the band members}} also <b>wore</b> <b>their</b> red jumpsuits from the self-titled album.

Mick, Joey, and Craig <b>wore</b> <b>their</b> All Hope Is Gone masks for the whole show. An effigy of Paul Gray stood between Craig and Joey's drum kit. The effigy {{included}} Paul's self-titled mask, his self-titled jumpsuit and his left-handed bass guitar beside it. For the American leg of the tour, they <b>wore</b> <b>their</b> red Iowa jumpsuits along with some matching to their Iowa masks.|$|R
