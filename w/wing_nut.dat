2500|$|On the Leeds and Liverpool Canal {{there is}} a variety of {{different}} lock gear. Some paddles are raised by turning what is in effect a large horizontal <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> (butterfly nut) lifting a screw-threaded bar attached {{to the top of the}} paddle. Others are operated by lifting a long wooden lever, which operates a wooden plate which seals the culvert. These are known locally as [...] "jack cloughs". Bottom gate paddles are sometimes operated by a horizontal ratchet which also slides a wooden plate sideways, rather than the more common vertical lift. Many of these idiosyncratic paddles have been [...] "modernised" [...] and they are becoming rare.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968 and 1969 Buick {{offered the}} GS 400 in a {{convertible}} and hardtop model. [...] Standard {{issue of the}} GS 400 was a 400 cubic inch (6.6L) engine (with likely lower stated horsepower rating to keep insurance premiums lower) of 340 horsepower (350hp stage 1 [...] ) and 440ft. lbs. torque, a four barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor, dual exhaust, 2.93 standard gear ratio optional ( [...] limited slip differential, (3.64 stage 1 option, 3.42 with A/C [...] ), and the available three speed turbo Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission (revered as the finest automatic transmission ever built, and commonly called Turbo Hydramatic 400), U-shape Hurst (automatic transmission) shifter and linkage, located on a center console. [...] A 1968 or 1969 GS400 equipped with the TH400 auto transmission was faster off the line than many of its contemporaries thanks to an unusually [...] "low" [...] 1st gear. Shift pattern for the TH400 from most forward position is Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, Second, First. A standard 3 spd or optional 4 spd manual gearbox was also available. [...] Compression ratio on this engine was a very sensible 10.25:1, which allowed {{for the use of}} any grade gasoline to be used in normal driving without pinging. [...] The factory air cleaner was covered with a large round chromed cover, secured with a <b>wing</b> <b>nut.</b> [...] The small air scoop behind the hood hinge-line on the 1968 model was fake, although it could perhaps technically be called functional, as it could have bettered the air flow available to the climate control system.|$|E

5000|$|The late 20s {{and early}} 30s were {{an era of}} {{transition}} in relation to bicycle equipment and race conditions. Areas of controversy were the use of variable gears and two sprocket wheels, single tyres, the use of butterfly or <b>wing</b> <b>nuts</b> [...] {{and the provision of}} outside assistance. The Dunlop Grand Prix permitted variable gears but prohibited butterfly or <b>wing</b> <b>nuts</b> and singles. The riders were required to repair their own bikes during the stage, were not able to change bicycles unless it was bona fide damaged [...] and no spare parts or other assistance were permitted. Similarly the riders were not permitted to accept food or drink other than from officials at feeding stations or procured by rider from established store, hotel or refreshment room.|$|R

50|$|The blade {{is usually}} clamped into {{position}} using {{a pair of}} wingnuts. Although <b>wing</b> <b>nuts</b> are usually intended for operation without tools it is often impossible to apply sufficient force purely by hand. Wingnut spanners (US English: wrenches) greatly increase the torque that may be applied, ensuring that the blade is securely clamped.|$|R

50|$|Scribe-compasses is an {{instrument}} used by carpenters and other tradesmen. Some compasses {{can be used}} to scribe circles, bisect angles and in this case to trace a line. It is the compass in the most simple form. Both branches are crimped metal. One branch has a pencil sleeve while the other branch is crimped with a fine point protruding from the end. The <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> serves two purposes, first it tightens the pencil and secondly it locks in the desired distance when the <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> is turned clockwise.|$|E

50|$|Knutsen started {{building}} Hawaiian steel guitars {{as early as}} 1908. Most of the guitars produced by Knutsen have spruce tops, all have lateral or diagonal bracing on the back, also due to his eccentric building skills many of his guitars used some crude solutions such as: wide number of screws, brackets, <b>wing</b> <b>nuts,</b> sheared-off tuning machine plates, odd-shaped nuts and dressmaker's seam tape rather than wood strips to reinforce ribs and butt fitted back plates.|$|R
5000|$|The MON-100 {{mine body}} has a smooth, well {{finished}} appearance with a webbing handle {{mounted on the}} upper edge, it is usually attached to a mounting shackle by <b>wing</b> <b>nuts</b> {{on either side of}} the mine body (the shackle is connected to a spike for securing the mine to buildings, trees etc.). The concave face of the mine has a detonator cavity in its center (this is the side aimed at the target).|$|R

Some jurisdictions, including West Germany, prohibited eared hubcaps. Some manufacturers (e.g. Maserati) preferred to hold the wheel on the splined hub by capping with a single conventional unwinged nut requiring a special large spanner.|$|E
50|$|A sliding T bevel, {{also known}} as a bevel gauge or false square is an {{adjustable}} gauge for setting and transferring angles. The handle is usually made of wood or plastic and is connected to a metal blade with a thumbscrew or <b>wing</b> <b>nut.</b> The blade pivots and can be locked at any angle by loosening or tightening the thumbscrew.The bevel can be used to duplicate an existing angle, or set to a desired angle by using it with any number of other measuring tools (such as a protractor, or framing square).|$|E
50|$|The risk of firemen {{tying down}} the safety valve remained. This was {{encouraged}} by them being fitted with easily adjustable <b>wing</b> <b>nuts,</b> the practice of adjusting the boiler's working pressure via the safety valve being an accepted behaviour well into the 1850s. It was later common with Salter valves {{for them to be}} fitted in pairs, one adjustable and often calibrated for use as a gauge, the other sealed inside a locked cover to prevent tampering.|$|R
50|$|The storage/floor sections, each 1.2 by 2.4 m {{were made}} from plywood and {{insulated}} with R-7 fiberglass insulation, which provided a portable, warm and cleanable floor. The wooden arches holding up the roof were attached to the floor sections with steel fittings and <b>wing</b> <b>nuts,</b> and were strong {{enough to hold a}} winter‚Äôs snow. The arches, the key to the design, were curved, glue-laminated wooden 15 cm beams on 1.2 m centers that folded in quarters on steel hinges and removable pins.|$|R
30|$|Version 2 (Fig.¬† 3 b) {{was created}} to improve the {{shortcomings}} of Version 1. Two stainless steel clamps were made to house {{the body and the}} two end-caps by using four stainless steel studdings and <b>wing</b> <b>nuts</b> holding the clamps. This design improved the leakage problem and minimized incidences of breakage. However, this design was inconvenient for packing sediment material because the lower end-cap and the body were not fixed together once the upper end-cap was taken off for packing. Furthermore, manufacturing of the stainless steel clamps was costly.|$|R
5000|$|Screw You: Played in two-player pairs, {{teams have}} to advance each player through {{a pair of}} {{obstacle}} courses and unscrew an oversize <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> {{at the end of}} the first two obstacles. Once each pair advances to a stairway at the third obstacle, the next pair repeats the process, and the process continues until each pair crosses the finish line. (Note: Since the Rookies were short one male player, one guy has to go through the obstacle course twice.) The first team to advance all of their players through the obstacle course wins.|$|E

5000|$|Garlasco {{has made}} it a {{personal}} objective to prevent the use of cluster munitions. He co-authored the 2006 Human Rights Watch report condemning Israel‚Äôs use of such weapons in Lebanon and a report in 2008 documenting how civilians living in South Ossetia suffered the use of cluster munitions by both the Russian and Georgian armies. Colin Kahl, a professor of security studies at Georgetown University, said that Garlasco [...] "knows more about airstrikes {{than anyone in the}} world who isn't in the military currently", adding that [...] "when Marc says stuff is messed up, the military has to take it seriously. It's not some <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> in a human rights group out to get the military".|$|E

25|$|In August {{the balloon}} was {{commissioned}} to fly despite known technical flaws. The commissioners {{emphasized that the}} crew, although equipped with personal parachutes, had few chances of bailing out in case of emergency: the sole airtight hatch was held in place with twelve <b>wing</b> <b>nuts.</b> Opening it, even on solid ground, required minutes. The crew did not wear pressure suits (they simply did not exist at that time) or individual breathing sets, relying on stored supplies of compressed oxygen and carbon dioxide absorber cartridges. Crew survival depended on the gondola's integrity; bailing out without breathing sets was feasible only at altitudes below 8,000 metres.|$|R
