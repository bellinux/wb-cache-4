25|$|A proper lubricant, {{typically}} graphite powder, is essential. <b>Wheel</b> <b>alignment</b> {{is important}} both to minimize wheel {{contact with the}} axle head and body {{as well as to}} limit the contact between the wheels and guide rail as the car travels down the track. There are 32 friction causing surfaces on a pinewood derby car. These include the surfaces of all four wheels which touch either the axle, the body or the track and the surfaces of all four axles which touch the wheel. Neglecting to polish and lubricate any of these 32 surfaces will result in degraded performance. The center of mass of a typical car is low and slightly ahead of the rear axle, which helps the car track straight as well as providing a slight advantage due to the additional gravitational potential energy.|$|E

30|$|Theory and {{practice}} of management in terms of wheel and rail contact during the past 20  years are to increase the life of wheel and track and improve their adaptability {{and the use of}} greater axial loads. Wheels combined with high-strength steel-polished rail profiles lower wear and improve lubrication. Various effects such as difficulty of body contact, coefficient of friction, changes in lateral and longitudinal creep and wear volume are effective. Due to the lack of accurate predictions of actions and reactions created between rail and wheel (adhesion between the rail and the <b>wheels,</b> the <b>alignment</b> of rails and wheels together, rail level pollution, ambient temperature, humidity, hard surfaces, railways, the quality of the natural and physical infrastructure and other factors), determination of the level of each factor on the force between the rail and wheel wear rate is difficult [5].|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{performance}} of the future high-energy physics experiments depends on the stability and design of the supporting structures of the particle's detection elements. These structures, typically with several meter long, must be light, highly stable, stiff and radiation tolerant {{in an environment where}} external vibrations, high radiation levels, material ageing, temperature and humidity gradients are not negligible [1]. These requirements generally orient the materials choice towards Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) with highly performing fibres and resins qualified for aerospace applications. The engineering design of these structures comprises a careful development of finite element models and further validation by prototype testing. This paper presents the methodology used in the certification process of one of these structures: a 2. 5 meter CFRP-honeycomb disc known as <b>alignment</b> <b>wheel.</b> A comparison of simulation results with experimental measurements in a full-scale prototype, concerning the dynamic characterisation of the structure, is presented. The analysis and the full-scale test provide an optimised approach of the construction with respect to deformations, natural frequencies and material used...|$|R

5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} was a heavily {{modified version of}} the Chapman strut, originally developed for Chapman's earlier Formula racing car designs and used in the Lotus Elan. In the Europa, the vertical [...] "strut" [...] element pivots on the wheel hub at its lower end and doesn't control wheel camber angle as-in earlier Lotus designs. <b>Wheel</b> location and <b>alignment</b> is controlled instead by interaction between a fixed-length, articulated driveshaft top link, a simple tubular lower link, and a large box-section radius arm running diagonally forward to the chassis. These radius arms {{played a critical role in}} giving the precise tracking and handling desired, as the Chapman Strut's use of the driveshaft to resist lateral forces was compromised by the rubber engine and transaxle mounts needed to isolate vibrations from the car body. A careful compromise between the radius arm mount's stiffness, isolation and car handling was required, culminating eventually in a sandwich bush that was flexible against shear but stiff in compression and tension. The car's subsequent resulting handling prompted automotive writers to describe the Europa as the nearest thing to a Formula car for the road.|$|R

40|$|Amtrak's Northeast {{corridor}} (NEC), with 150 mph Acela {{passenger trains}} operating on tracks shared with much slower and heavier freight trains, places unique {{demands on the}} wheel/rail system. The traffic mix runs the gamut between slow moving heavy axle load trains operating at considerable under-balanced elevations and high speed trains running at up to 7 inches of cant deficiency over an alignment far more curved than any other high speed corridor around the world. This poses a particularly challenging maintenance environment in which to operate a high-speed service. Among its many efforts to facilitate higher speeds and more efficient services on passenger lines, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has initiated a landmark project to help Amtrak engineer the wheel/rail interaction on the NEC for improved safety, ride quality and lower maintenance costs. This paper reports on the improved curved-rail profiles that {{have been designed to}} maximize the effectiveness of limited rail grinding resources during the 2002 grinding cycle. It reports on an alternate wheel profile that will soon be tested for its ability to reduce flange wear on the high-speed Acela vehicles and for its impact on stability, wheel climb, wear and contact fatigue. Beyond the important safety implications of this program, Amtrak is working to apply the findings to improve system reliability and to maximize the cost effectiveness of wheel and rail maintenance. The paper discusses maintenance management in general and reports on a wheel/rail management system being developed jointly between Amtrak and the National Research Council of Canada. This system will perform an integrated engineering analysis of an increasing number of data streams (e. g. measured rail and <b>wheel</b> profiles, track <b>alignment</b> and geometry measurements, and vehicle performance data) to provide guidance on wheel and rail maintenance policies and practices.

He put this new product on the market and during the Great Depression, the Lee Hunter, Jr., Manufacturing Co. sold the $497 Kwikurent charger as fast as the company could make them. After serving in both the U.S. Army Engineering Corps and Ordnance Corps during World War II, Hunter returned to St. Louis in 1946 and reopened his business under the name of Hunter Engineering. Lee Hunter also laid the foundation for a global distribution base for Hunter products. In 1955 Hunter developed a new <b>wheel</b> <b>alignment</b> system called 'Lite-A-Line,' which became the industry standard.
