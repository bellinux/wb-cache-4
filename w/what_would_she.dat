500|$|The episode {{features}} mash-up {{covers of}} [...] "It's My Life" [...] by Bon Jovi and [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] by Usher, and [...] "Halo" [...] by Beyonc√© Knowles and [...] "Walking on Sunshine" [...] by Katrina and the Waves. Both tracks were released as singles, available for digital download. [...] "It's My Life / Confessions Part II" [...] charted at number 7 in Ireland, 14 in the UK, 22 in Australia, 25 in Canada and 30 in America, while [...] "Halo / Walking on Sunshine" [...] charted at number 4 in Ireland, 9 in the UK, 10 in Australia, 28 in Canada and 40 in America. Michele {{has revealed that}} she practiced talking [...] "manically" [...] for several days in order to convey the effects of pseudoephedrine on Rachel. In order to portray the character in her altered state, she questioned: [...] "How manic is {{the right amount of}} manic? What would Rachel be like on uppers? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> sound like?" [...] She deemed performing the mash-up piece in that state [...] "so much fun".|$|E
500|$|Filmmaker Walt Disney {{himself had}} first {{attempted}} {{to adapt the}} Brothers Grimm fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into a feature-length animated film during the 1930s. However, he abandoned the project because the story was considered too [...] "small." [...] When they were approached to direct Tangled in 2008, directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided {{that it would be}} best to update the story [...] "for a modern audience", soon discovering [...] "that the problem with having a prison character ... is that they don't have anyone to talk to." [...] Howard explained that because Rapunzel is incapable of having a decent conversation with Mother Gothel, the isolated, incarcerated heroine [...] "needed someone to relate to." [...] Unwilling to default to using the traditional [...] "boring, ordinary side-kick," [...] Greno and Howard created Pascal, conceiving the character as a chameleon because Rapunzel is, according to Greno, [...] "a rough-and-tumble girl." [...] Howard explained that [...] "we wanted to do ... something fresh, something different. This girl, she's not a dainty, precious girl ... So <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> have? ... She's going to have a lizard." [...] Additionally, Howard believed that a reptile would compliment Rapunzel's personality best, describing the character as [...] "a quirky pet for a quirky young woman." ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly I {{was filled}} with the thought of her and a great longing for her. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> do when she {{realised}} our immense disaster? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> do? How would she take it? It filled me with astonishment to realise how little I could tell....|$|E
60|$|She acted of her {{own free}} will. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> do <b>she</b> did, and made nobody responsible.|$|R
60|$|As Dorothy {{had no idea}} <b>what</b> <b>would</b> do, <b>she</b> {{could make}} no reply to this.|$|R
60|$|Kate {{stood at}} the front gate looking after them. Do <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would,</b> <b>she</b> could not help a tear or two rising to her eyes. Mr. Loudon noticed her {{standing}} there, and {{he went down to}} her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well! What did you see. Didn't {{you know}} him?' She forgot {{that the other}} did not know him from her point of view. But the {{question}} went through Stephen's heart like a sword. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> not have given to have known him! <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> not give to know him now! [...] . She spoke mechanically: ...|$|E
6000|$|Ashurst {{released}} the hair. Stella! <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> call him--after this? But {{she called him}} nothing; till at bedtime he said, deliberately: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What are {{you talking}} about, Jeff Durgin?" [...] Cynthia demanded, severely. [...] "What would your mother do? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> do this winter?" ...|$|E
60|$|All day he {{had waited}} for this awful moment, forgetting his own misery, his own agonised feeling of an irretrievable loss, in the horrible thought of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> endure, <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> think, when first she {{realised}} the terrible indignity, {{which was to be}} put upon her.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} well," [...] Victor said; [...] "but <b>what</b> opinion <b>would</b> <b>she</b> have of me if she thought me capable of deserting her in that way?" ...|$|R
60|$|Eleanor {{found that}} it was quite {{impossible}} for herself to commence a conversation. In the first place she could find nothing to say; words, which were generally plenty enough with her, would not come to her relief. And moreover, do <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would,</b> <b>she</b> could hardly prevent herself from crying.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wouldn't she, now? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> be? Can {{either of}} {{you tell me what}} the wife of a Prince of Chitakov would call herself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Madge sobbed out {{the whole}} story disconsolately. Burton's father would not let him marry {{her because she was}} an Oliver. And, oh, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> do? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{could that}} be, my dear?" [...] asked the husband; [...] "in <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> {{be better off}} for leaving her own {{property}} to her husband?" ...|$|E
60|$|Jess {{turned to}} see <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen. <b>She</b> knew the whole story, and hoped {{he would take the}} man's hand; next, remembering their position, she hoped that he would.|$|R
6000|$|She blushed scarlet--do <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> {{could not}} help it--when he rose and bowed to her. Half choked, she came forward and offered her hand. She was so [...] "shocked to hear {{that he had been}} so dangerously ill,-- no one had even told them of it,--it had come upon them so suddenly;" [...] and so forth.|$|R
60|$|I {{paused for}} a bare second to collect my thoughts, so as to put the thing clearly to her. I might have known <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen. <b>She</b> dashed right in and {{collared}} the conversation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me," [...] {{she went}} on. [...] "If {{you met with}} your little Mary now, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> be like? What sort of woman would you expect to see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And this is February. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> have? She {{had better}} put her dirty {{money into the}} three per cents., if she is frightened at having to wait a week or two." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{dropped his}} hands to the counter by habit and {{stood for a moment}} {{regarding}} her awkwardly. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> do? Would she cut him? She came across the shop to him.|$|E
60|$|Bob wondered, {{in his own}} mind, <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> do if <b>she</b> {{was making}} bad weather.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Misery? Hear the witch, senors! Oh, have I not pampered her, {{heaped with}} jewels, clothes, coaches, what not? The saints alone know what 'I have spent on her. <b>What</b> more <b>would</b> <b>she</b> have of me?' ...|$|R
60|$|Now, Perronel {{might do}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> with him--he cared not.|$|R
6000|$|I {{remember}} how I handled and scrutinized that letter, seeking for some intimation that our former intimacy was still alive. We were to meet. How should we meet? How would she look at me? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> think of me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{she should}} {{make her way}} to London, which is likely--for where could she lose herself so readily as in this vast city; and <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> wish to do, but lose and hide herself, if she does not go home?--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a very {{different}} sort of thing, you know--that's absurd. But I must say I think Sir Lionel's behaviour is perfect." [...] <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> have said of Sir Lionel's behaviour had she known all the secrets of his establishments? ...|$|E
50|$|Margarita, Gabby's mother, asked Nene <b>what</b> more <b>would</b> <b>she</b> want? How {{much more}} can she ruin her son's life? Nene learned {{she could not}} change Gabby. He always had girls around him and {{continuously}} cheated on her.|$|R
60|$|It may {{be beyond}} the grave She shall find <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have.|$|R
6000|$|Aladdin bade her {{keep her}} cotton, for he would sell the lamp instead. As {{it was very}} dirty she began to rub it, that it might fetch a higher price. Instantly a hideous genie appeared, and asked <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have. <b>She</b> fainted away, but Aladdin, {{snatching}} the lamp, said boldly: ...|$|R
6000|$|Siegmund {{went back}} to his seat. He was relieved, but he trembled with sickness. We are all glad when intense moments are done with; but why did she fling round in that manner, {{stopping}} the keen note short; <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> do? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know how}} that may be, but he hasn't done it yet. Come, father; you don't like the man any more than she does. If {{you get tired of}} him in three days, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> do in her whole life?' ...|$|E
60|$|Making {{a violent}} effort she sat up. The silence of Ciccio {{in his bed}} was as horrible {{as the rest of}} the night. She had a horror of him also. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> do, where should she flee? She was lost--lost--lost utterly.|$|E
60|$|But {{that was}} not all. Either from sheer mischief, or from curiosity to see <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen, <b>she</b> insisted upon stopping, as the dance drew to a close, by Mildred's corner. That lady, however, proved herself equal to the occasion.|$|R
50|$|Yuruzu asks Rikka N. <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like, and <b>she</b> {{tells him}} {{she just wants}} a normal life with him.|$|R
60|$|Now, do <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{to prevent}} it, her alarm showed itself in Mary's eyes.|$|R
