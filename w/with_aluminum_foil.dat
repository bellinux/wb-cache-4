25|$|Individual shield (U/FTP): Individual {{shielding}} <b>with</b> <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil</b> {{for each}} twisted pair or quad. Common names: pair in metal foil, shielded twisted pair, screened twisted pair.

50|$|The G.P.C. label usually sold {{merchandise}} {{with unusual}} packaging, as such, the Gesticulate CD was a limited-edition release <b>with</b> an <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil</b> cover and screen-printed artwork.

25|$|Following this, the dinners {{are either}} covered <b>with</b> <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil</b> or paper, {{and the product}} is tightly packed with a partial vacuum created to ensure no {{evaporation}} takes place that can cause the food to dry out. Then the packaged dinners are placed in refrigerated storage facility, transported through a refrigerated truck, and are stored in the grocers freezer. TV dinners prepared with the aforementioned steps that is frozen and packaged properly can remain in near-perfect condition {{for a long time}} so long as it is stored at -18°C during shipping and storage.|$|E
25|$|Many plastic {{items for}} medical or {{laboratory}} use {{can be made}} from polypropylene because it can withstand the heat in an autoclave. Its heat resistance also enables it to be used as the manufacturing material of consumer-grade kettles. Food containers made from it will not melt in the dishwasher, and do not melt during industrial hot filling processes. For this reason, most plastic tubs for dairy products are polypropylene sealed <b>with</b> <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil</b> (both heat-resistant materials). After the product has cooled, the tubs are often given lids made of a less heat-resistant material, such as LDPE or polystyrene. Such containers provide a good hands-on example of the difference in modulus, since the rubbery (softer, more flexible) feeling of LDPE with respect to polypropylene of the same thickness is readily apparent. Rugged, translucent, reusable plastic containers made {{in a wide variety of}} shapes and sizes for consumers from various companies such as Rubbermaid and Sterilite are commonly made of polypropylene, although the lids are often made of somewhat more flexible LDPE so they can snap on to the container to close it. Polypropylene can also be made into disposable bottles to contain liquid, powdered, or similar consumer products, although HDPE and polyethylene terephthalate are commonly also used to make bottles. Plastic pails, car batteries, wastebaskets, pharmacy prescription bottles, cooler containers, dishes and pitchers are often made of polypropylene or HDPE, both of which commonly have rather similar appearance, feel, and properties at ambient temperature.|$|E
50|$|Most {{systems can}} be {{circumvented}} by placing the tagged goods in a bag lined <b>with</b> <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil.</b> The booster bag will act as a Faraday cage, shielding the tags from the antennas. Although some vendors claim that their acousto-magnetic systems cannot be defeated by bags shielded <b>with</b> <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil,</b> a sufficient amount of shielding (in the order of 30 layers of standard 20 µm foil) will defeat all standard systems.|$|E

5000|$|Foil-backed bubble pack. This is thin, more {{flexible}} than rigid panels, {{works as a}} vapor barrier, and resembles plastic bubble wrap <b>with</b> <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil</b> on both sides. Often used on cold pipes, cold ducts, and the underside of roof sheathing.|$|E
5000|$|The ASC-15 {{was built}} on an {{aluminum}} frame about 1.5x1.5x1 feet. [...] The sides, top and bottom were covered by pieces of laminated plastic, covered <b>with</b> gold-plated <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil.</b> These covers were slightly convex and ribbed for stiffness. Inside the covers were fifty-two logic sticks, each containing four welded encapsulated modules. These surrounded a bell frame housing a drum memory. See Figure 2.|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} for manufacturing long slender graphite tubing is desired. Such tubing has considerable application in truss supported spacecraft applications. The {{motivation for the}} selection of the tubing size developed in this program is for use as struts in a NASA, Langley Research Center truss supported antenna concept. The manufacturing procedure uses the LMSC vertical winding machine. A {{procedure for}} fabricating graphite epoxy tubing <b>with</b> an <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil</b> inner and outer wrap was also developed. The <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil</b> provides a vapor barrier, significantly improves the thermal conductivity, and provides an excellent thermal control surface...|$|R

30|$|Analysis of {{anthocyanins}} {{was conducted}} {{according to the}} method described by Hara et al. (2003). The fresh parts of C. heratensis (0.2  g) were extracted by rubbing with 3.0  mL of acidified methanol (MeOH: HCl; 99 : 1, v/v). The crude extract was centrifuged at 6000  rpm for 30  min and set it aside in dark (covered <b>with</b> an <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil)</b> overnight (yield of extraction: 1.1 %). The absorbance of the supernatant was recorded at 550  nm to detect anthocyanins.|$|R
50|$|By 1919, {{six other}} flavors (Wint-O-Green, Cl-O-Ve, Lic-O-Rice, Cinn-O-Mon, Vi-O-Let and Choc-O-Late) had been developed, and these {{remained}} the standard flavors {{until the late}} 1920s. In 1920, a new flavor called Malt-O-Milk was introduced. This flavor was received so poorly that it was discontinued {{after only a few}} years. In 1925, the tinfoil was replaced <b>with</b> <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil.</b>|$|E

50|$|Although {{the amount}} of {{shielding}} required depends on the system, its sensitivity, and the distance and orientation of the tags relative to its antennas, total enclosure of tags is not strictly necessary. Indeed, some shoplifters use clothes lined <b>with</b> <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil.</b> Low-frequency magnetic systems will require more shielding than radio-frequency systems due to their use of near-field magnetic coupling. Magnetic shielding, with steel or mu-metal, would be more effective, but also cumbersome and expensive.|$|E
50|$|His {{interests}} {{extended to}} loudspeaker design. With {{the help of}} Bozak, he developed a direct-radiator design using a single speaker <b>with</b> an <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil</b> cone, operating out of a vertical column, and offering a wide frequency response. A Simple Quality Rating System for Loudspeakers and Audio Systems appeared in the Journal of the Audio Engineering Society for July, 1963. He went on to invent the wide-range coherent transmission-line loudspeaker, which was granted U.S. Patent 3,424,873 in 1969 (filed in 1964).|$|R

50|$|A {{chocolate}} bomb is a firecracker {{which is}} exploded by revelers during Diwali and New Year's Eve celebrations in India. Chocolate bombs {{are made of}} tiny paperboard boxes stuffed with gunpowder. A fuse is inserted {{in one of the}} corners. The boxes are then tightly wrapped with jute strings and dried in the sun for three days. After that they are wrapped <b>with</b> colorful <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil,</b> making them resemble chocolates. The Burima brand of chocolate bombs were very popular in Kolkata in the 1990s. The firecracker has been declared illegal in West Bengal.|$|R

Garib also introduced Mac Farlane to Christopher Santos, another costume designer in Trinidad. Both Garib and Santos greatly influenced Mac Farlane’s work throughout his career.|$|E
50|$|Finnmark {{was created}} <b>with</b> <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil</b> {{applied to the}} fabric; a {{technique}} that gives a special light to this painting. It represents an arctic landscape in Finnmark, Norway near the border with Russia in Murmansk. A strong contrast is expressed with light and dark areas in horizontal lines, representing the snow objects in the dark northern winter, the relationship between light and shadow in the landscape, creating a perspective effect that allows the viewer {{to look beyond the}} tundra of Finnmark.|$|E
50|$|The ration {{differed}} from the standard wet-pack Meal, Combat, Individual (MCI) {{in that it was}} a freeze-dried, vacuum-packed individual ration meal weighing 11 oz packed in a waterproof grey-green canvas envelope lined <b>with</b> <b>aluminum</b> <b>foil.</b> Due to its discovered tendency to spoil in a wet or humid environment (e.g., all of South-east Asia), later ration packs came enclosed in an outer zip-lock clear-plastic bag to keep out the moisture. This drawback made it less than desirable as a standard ration.|$|E
