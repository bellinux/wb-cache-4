25|$|Fairly {{straightforward}} statistics provide {{estimates of}} whether associations between genes on lists {{are greater than}} what one would expect by chance. These statistics are interesting, even if they represent a substantial oversimplification of {{what is really going}} on. Here is an example. Suppose there are 10,000 genes in an experiment, only 50 (0.5%) of which play a known role in making cholesterol. The experiment identifies 200 regulated genes. Of those, 40 (20%) turn out to be on a list of cholesterol genes as well. Based on the overall prevalence of the cholesterol genes (0.5%) one expects an average of 1 cholesterol gene for every 200 regulated genes, that is, 0.005 times 200. This expectation is an average, so one expects to see more than one some of the time. The question becomes how often <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> 40 instead of 1 due to pure chance.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} March 1941, Hitler {{wanted the}} convoys {{supplying}} the British Expeditionary force in Greece stopped, and the Italian Navy was the only force able to attempt this. Cunningham stated in his biography: [...] "I myself was inclined {{to think that the}} Italians would not try anything. I bet Commander Power, the Staff Officer, Operations, the sum of ten shillings that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> nothing of the enemy." [...] Under pressure from Germany, the Italian Fleet planned to launch an attack on the British Fleet on 28 March 1941.|$|E

[...] Van Gogh uses impasto paint and color to reflect light, much as <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> it in with our eye. Two tall cypress trees and a white house flank the drawbridge which has a moveable center section between stone abutments. The painting is currently at the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne, Germany.|$|E
500|$|All {{band members}} of Bloc Party {{conceived}} A Weekend in the City during 2005 while on tour {{in support of}} their critically acclaimed debut album Silent Alarm. Despite missing their home city of London, the quartet became increasingly disillusioned with the culture in the area each time they sporadically returned. Band member Gordon Moakes has noted, [...] "The contrast we saw between being away on tour and being home... <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> that London wasn't changing really and that the people we'd grown up with were part of that." [...] Okereke wrote many songs in 2005 and early 2006 and used a concept he called [...] "Urbanite Relaxation" [...] to expand upon the themes of life and leisure in the metropolis. The band recorded around 30soundchecks for the initial lyrics using a MiniDisc player. The rest of the tracks were written in April 2006 before they entered the studio recording process.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, John Lasseter {{spoke about}} how they worked {{hard to make the}} {{animation}} believable, saying: [...] "It took many months of trial and error, and practicing test animation, to figure out how each car moves and how their world works. Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator {{to be able to put}} some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, it was so much fun because <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> things that we had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way." ...|$|E
500|$|La Dispute {{recorded}} {{the remainder of}} the album in a month in StadiumRed in New York City in April 2011. Dreyer wanted to give the album the most organic feel possible by using no artificial reverb or studio techniques that would give the album a synthesized quality. Joe Pedulla stated that he wanted to give the album a more raw and authentic sound: [...] "We were just trying to capture {{what it would be like}} for an audience member sitting and listening to a guitar in a room." [...] He also credited Dreyer's vocal range: [...] "Jordan Dreyer has this crazy dynamic range – a 20dB swing from how loud and quiet he gets. So there are some vocal parts with no resonance at all, where he's speaking/singing softly, the room is not echoing, and he sounds close and in-your-face. Then the dynamic swing happens, and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> how big it can get." [...] When recording vocals, Dreyer makes very long takes, trying to emulate the sound of his voice in live performances. The album's recording features what the band considers [...] "auxiliary instrumentation", including trumpet and rhodes piano, and even improvised instruments that Sterenburg's brother created out of scrap metal.|$|E

One of the witnesses, Ed Cabansag, said in his statement: [...] "We figured the lights were coming from past the forest since nothing was visible when we passed through the woody forest. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> a glowing near the beacon light, but as we got closer we found it to be a lit-up farmhouse. We got to a vantage point where we could determine that what we were chasing was only a beacon light off in the distance." [...] Another participant, John Burroughs, also stated: [...] "We could see a beacon going around so we went towards it. We followed it for about two miles [...] before we could [...] it was coming from a lighthouse." ...|$|E
2500|$|Source-critical {{scholarship}} {{suggests that}} these two roles come from different sources, which later were spliced together to form the Book(s) of Samuel. The oldest {{is considered to be}} that marking Samuel as the local seer of Ramah, who willingly anointed Saul as king in secret, while the latter presents Samuel as a national figure, begrudgingly anointing Saul as king in front of a national assembly. This later source is generally known as the Republican Source, since it denigrates the monarchy (particularly the actions of Saul) and favours religious figures, in contrast to the other main source [...] the Monarchial Source [...] which treats it favourably. Theoretically if we had the Monarchial Source <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>see</b> Saul appointed king by public acclamation, due to his military victories, and not by cleromancy involving Samuel. Another difference between the sources is that the Republican Source treats the ecstatic prophets as somewhat independent from Samuel (1 Samuel 9:1ff) rather than having been led by him (...)
