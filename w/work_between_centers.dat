A new class of nanodiamond hybrid nanostructures was developed using bottom-up synthesis methods. In this <b>work,</b> coupling <b>between</b> NV <b>centers</b> and plasmonic, excitonic and magnetic nanoparticles in these nanodiamond hybrid nanostructures is investigated using fluorescence lifetime measurements, spin relaxometry measurements and modeled using finite element method (FEM) and Monte Carlo simulations. This work not only characterizes the properties of these nanodiamond-hybrid nanostructures but also facilitates design guidelines for future hybrid structures with enhanced metrological and imaging capabilities...|$|R
40|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} one of the most common {{malignancies}} in women worldwide. Due to an effective screening programme, in the Netherlands cervical cancer is often detected in early stages of disease. For early stage (International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IB/IIA) cervical cancer, radical surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy in the finding of poor prognostic factors and primary (chemo-) radiotherapy are equally effective treatment options. Survival rates after treatment are relatively good with 5 year survival rates of 85 - 95 %. Unfortunately, treatment for cervical cancer may induce morbidity. Both surgery and radiotherapy are known to affect bladder-, bowel- and sexual functioning after treatment. When the morbidity of the treatment is high and life after treatment is long, loss of quality of life (QoL) is an important aspect. Hereby, more and more attention is focused on tailored treatment, finding the optimal balance between good survival results with maintenance of QoL. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the role of radicality of surgery and the resultant impact on tumour control, survival and morbidity. Collaborated <b>work</b> <b>between</b> oncological <b>centers</b> in the Netherlands made it possible to conduct a series of studies finding answers to the importance of the extent of surgery and morbidity and QoL after treatment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A good {{plant layout}} creates an {{efficient}} process flow of products, materials, tools, equipment and workers. This results in saving on material handling costs and movement time <b>between</b> <b>work</b> <b>centers,</b> {{in addition to}} reducing operator’s fatigue. Most companies start small and grow into big establishments, expanding and adjusting plant layout to accommodate new lines or work stations. The flow of work becomes disrupted and non-value motions are created. This paper report on a re-organization of a section in a small and medium industry manufacturing wheel barrows. Systematic Layout Procedure (SLP) proposed by Muther is used. Time study is used to show the effect of the re-organized layout. The improved layout reduced the travel distances by 52 % and cycle time effectively reduced by 12 %...|$|R

40|$|The {{toxicity}} and {{hazard level}} {{associated with the}} use of hypergolic fuels necessitates the development of technology capable of detecting the presence of such fuels in a variety of different environments and conditions. The most commonly used sensors for the detection of hypergolic fuels are electrochemical in nature, which have serious limitations when used as area monitoring devices. Recent collaborative <b>work</b> <b>between</b> Kennedy Space <b>Center</b> and ASRC Aerospace has led to the development of indicators which exhibit a color change upon exposure to hydrazine under different conditions. The indicators under investigation on this developmental effort are para-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (PDAB), various formulations of universal pH indicators, and potassium tetrachloroaurate (KAuCl 4). These chemochromic indicators have been tested for the detection of hydrazine under various conditions: pure liquid fuel, aqueous fuel solution, saline aqueous fuel solutions, vapor fuel, and 3 -month shelf life study, which included UV protection, thermal extremes, and normal storage conditions. The hypergolic fuel indicator test was conducted with the indicator impregnated into a wipe material to test the applicability of the indicator to be used to capture (absorb) and indicate the presence of hypergolic fuels. Each of the indicators performed well, with the universal pH indicator being the best candidate because of the visible response color change and the indicator stability after the shelf life study...|$|R

40|$|Early-onset {{mitochondrial}} encephalopathies {{comprise a}} challenging group of neurodegenerative disorders. This {{is due to}} their progressive nature, often leading to major disability and premature death, {{as well as their}} diagnostic complexity and lack of customized treatments. The overall aim of the research presented in this thesis was to explore the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of childhood-onset mitochondrial diseases with central nervous system involvement. The present thesis focuses on early-onset mitochondrial encephalopathies with particular emphasis on Alpers and Leigh syndromes. We studied 19 patients with Alpers syndrome and showed specific genotype-phenotype correlations depending on the presence or not of POLG 1 mutations. We have further identified, with the help of whole exome sequencing, mutations in NARS 2 and PARS 2 in two of our patients with Alpers syndrome not associated to POLG 1, being the first to link mutations in these genes to human disease and to Alpers syndrome. We also present the natural history data on a unique cohort of 130 patients with Leigh syndrome, along with predictors of long-term outcomes. Disease onset before six months of age, failure to thrive, brainstem lesions on neuroimaging and intensive care treatment were associated with poorer survival. Based on the findings from this study, we suggest revised diagnostic criteria for Leigh syndrome. We also studied the brain MRIs of 66 patients with mitochondrial disorders with central nervous system involvement. We describe the optimal use of brain neuroimaging in the diagnostic work-up of suspected mitochondrial disorders, as well as its role in the differential diagnosis among mitochondrial encephalopathies and from other diseases with similar features. This thesis advances our knowledge of the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of early-onset mitochondrial encephalopathies and discusses the applicable diagnostic methods, from the diagnostic criteria used to define clinical syndromes, {{to the role of the}} traditional and modern methodologies in the diagnostic work-up of these complex disorders. The study of patients with Leigh syndrome is the first joint research <b>work</b> <b>between</b> eight <b>centers</b> from six European countries specializing in mitochondrial diseases, creating a strong platform for ongoing collaboration on mitochondrial research projects...|$|R
