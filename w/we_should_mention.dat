6000|$|They now took {{on to his}} fancy, Miss Gostrey and he, {{the image}} of the Babes in the Wood; they could trust the merciful {{elements}} to let them continue at peace. He had been great already, as he knew, at postponements; but he had only to get afresh into the rhythm of one to feel its fine attraction. It amused him to say to himself that he might for all the world have been going to die--die resignedly; the scene was filled for him with so deep a death-bed hush, so melancholy a charm. That meant the postponement of everything else--which made so for the quiet lapse of life; and the postponement in especial of the reckoning to come--unless indeed the reckoning to come were to be one and the same thing with extinction. It faced him, the reckoning, over the shoulder of much interposing experience--which also faced him; and one would float to it doubtless duly through these caverns of Kubla Khan. It was really behind everything; it hadn't merged in what he had done; his final appreciation of what he had done--his appreciation on the spot--would provide it with its main sharpness. The spot so focussed was of course Woollett, and he was to see, at the best, what Woollett would be with everything there changed for him. Wouldn't THAT revelation practically amount to the wind-up of his career? Well, the summer's end would show; his suspense had meanwhile exactly the sweetness of vain delay; and he had with it, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention,</b> other pastimes than Maria's company--plenty of separate musings in which his luxury failed him but at one point. He was well in port, the outer sea behind him, and {{it was only a matter}} of getting ashore. There was a question that came and went for him, however, as he rested against the side of his ship, and it was a little to get rid of the obsession that he prolonged his hours with Miss Gostrey. It was a question about himself, but it could only be settled by seeing Chad again; it was indeed his principal reason for wanting to see Chad. After that it wouldn't signify--it was a ghost that certain words would easily lay to rest. Only the young man must be there to take the words. Once they were taken he wouldn't have a question left; none, that is, in connexion with this particular affair. It wouldn't then matter even to himself that he might now have been guilty of speaking BECAUSE of what he had forfeited. That was the refinement of his supreme scruple--he wished so to leave what he had forfeited out of account. He wished not to do anything because he had missed something else, because he was sore or sorry or impoverished, because he was maltreated or desperate; he wished to do everything because he was lucid and quiet, just the same for himself on all essential points as he had ever been. Thus it was that while he virtually hung about for Chad he kept mutely putting it: [...] "You've been chucked, old boy; but what has that to do with it?" [...] It would have sickened him to feel vindictive.|$|E

25|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>mention</b> {{that many}} {{attempts}} at CLP were {{also based on}} the following result, first proved by Bulman-Fleming and McDowell in 1978 by using a categorical 1974 result of Shannon, see also Goodearl and Wehrung in 2001 for a direct argument.|$|R

30|$|Notice that if {{we choose}} p= 0 in (1.2), we get the q-Bernstein-Kantorovich {{operators}} which were defined by Mahmudov and Sabancıgil in [25]. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>mention</b> that in [26] the authors defined a different version of q-Bernstein-Kantorovich operators, where they used the usual integral instead of q-integral in the definition.|$|R
50|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> {{the fire}} {{which led to}} the {{decision}} to tear down the auditorium and several classrooms that had smoke damage. Fire was started by a cigarette in the class room on the southwest side of the building. Students missed only one day of instruction as classes were held in the cafeteria and elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|Among other sights in Hrodna and its environs, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> the Orthodox cathedral, a polychrome Russian Revival extravaganza from 1904; {{the botanical}} garden, {{the first in}} the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, founded in 1774; a curiously curved {{building}} on the central square (1780s); a 254-metre-high TV tower (1984); and Stanisławów, a summer residence of the last Polish king.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{this author}} has written {{numerous}} articles and book chapters, not just focused in the African musical contributions in Latino America, but also extending his interest to Linguistics, Epistemology and History, {{as well as}} to the contribution of the Chinese musical traditions to the Cuban culture. In those areas of study <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> works such as: ...|$|E

30|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>mention</b> the {{difficulty}} of incorporating the effects of technological progress. Marginal reduction costs studies in general make predictions about the medium-term with considerable uncertainties regarding the development of individual technologies, their costs and fuel prices. This is an unresolved question; the most attractive remedy is transparency concerning the assumptions of the model, and to evaluate {{the sensitivity of the}} results against these assumptions.|$|R
50|$|Most recently, some {{recordings}} of Rumbas gallegas {{in which the}} Cuban rhythmic component is highlighted have been produced in Galicia. We can point out, among others, {{a version of the}} “Rumba dos cinco marinheiros” by the renowned group Muxicas., where we can perceive the well known “clave cubana” rhythm in the instrumental background. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>mention</b> a recording of the same piece by the bagpiper Carlos Núñez Muñoz and the legendary Irish group “The Chieftains,” accompanied by an autochthonous Cuban musical ensemble.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first people}} from day-present Togo emigrated to modern United States arrived as slaves {{during the colonial}} period. So, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> to Cudjo Lewis (ca. 1840 - 1935), {{considered}} the last person born on African soil to have been enslaved in the United States when slavery was still lawful and arrived to Mobile from Dahomey in 1859.|$|E
5000|$|Several other {{regional}} styles of knife and stick fighting remain in existence. These are kept alive by individual Masters at Arms who teach their techniques privately. Amongst the knife styles <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> the styles of Rome, Neaples, Salerno, Calabria and Corsica (which nowadays is a French region). Disciplines focusing on staff fighting include, Bastone Calabrese (Calabrian Stick Fighting), Bastone Milanese, Bastone Piemontese, Taccaro and Bordone ...|$|E
50|$|Cuba {{also has}} {{produced}} a wealth of folk musical instruments. Among the most important ones <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> the Claves, the Bongo drum and the Conga, derived from original African instruments; {{as well as the}} Tres, a descendant of the Spanish Laúd. There are also others less well known folk instruments such as the Tingo-Talango or Tumbandera (Ground bow), the Botija and the Marímbula, a sort of African Mbira.|$|E
30|$|While an auroral breakup was {{occurring}} simultaneously with the launch, the sounding rocket {{flew through the}} auroral active region. There were two auroral active arcs which crossed the rocket trajectory. The second arc around 124 – 131 km altitude was {{within the range of}} sheath analysis. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>mention</b> that observations by the N 2 temperature instrument (NTV), which emitted the artificial electron beam (Kurihara et al., 2006), onboard the rocket affected the electron densities and the probe potentials below about 115 km altitude in the ascent (see Wakabayashi and Ono, 2006).|$|R
60|$|He now resumed the labors of the pen, {{which his}} recent {{excursion}} to Paris rendered doubly necessary. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> have <b>mentioned</b> a Life of Parnell, published by him {{shortly after the}} Deserted Village. It was, as usual, a piece of job work, hastily got up for pocket-money. Johnson spoke slightingly of it, and the author, himself, thought proper to apologize for its meagerness; yet, in so doing, used a simile which for beauty of imagery and felicity of language is enough of itself to stamp a value upon the essay.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>mention</b> other {{measures}} which combat CO 2 emissions. The “CO 2 charter” {{brought in by}} the MEEDDAT in 2007 {{in order to meet}} the country’s undertakings under the Kyoto protocol, i.e. not to emit more greenhouse gases in 2012 than in 1990. It had been signed by 10 road haulage companies in 2008 (including Chronopost, Geodis and Dentressangle), but has been signed by many more companies since the abandonment of the carbon tax, as though road haulage firms felt that they ought to choose their manner of participating in carbon emissions reductions themselves.|$|R
50|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> that, {{although}} his Provostship terminated in 1854, Mr. Stewart {{remained in the}} Town Council {{until the end of}} 1855, in order that, as Chairman of the Water Scheme, he might give the town the benefit of his services in carrying through the Bill. On retiring from the Council he ceased to take any interest in municipal affairs; but as a county proprietor he took an active part in all county matters.|$|E
50|$|Turning now to {{the field}} of photography, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> such avant-garde artists as Josep Masana, Josep Batlles, Pere Català Pic and Emili Godes, as well as Agustí Centelles for his {{important}} graphic work documenting the Spanish Civil War. Finally, the new avant-garde that emerged during the post-war years is represented by Otho Lloyd and Joaquim Gomis, whose pioneering work found its continuation in the Neorealists Francesc Català-Roca, Joan Colom, Oriol Maspons and Xavier Miserachs, among others.|$|E
50|$|The Prophet owned six bows: az-Zawra’, ar-Rauha’, as-Safra’, al-Bayda’, al-Katum - {{which was}} broke {{during the battle}} of Battle of Uhud, and was taken by Qatadah bin an-Nu’man - and as-Saddad. The Prophet had a quiver called al-Kafur, and a strap for it made from tanned skin, as well as three silver {{circular}} rings, a buckle, and an edge made of silver. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> that Ibn Taymiyyah said that there are no authentic narrations that the Prophet ever wore a strap around his waist.|$|E
30|$|We {{used this}} system with our first patient {{enrolled}} in our BCT study. The patient was seated upright {{in a comfortable}} chair. Our cameras and video projector system were mounted on {{a small piece of}} furniture that could easily slide on the floor. The picture taking process took only a few minutes and did not interfere significantly with the standard clinical exam by the surgeon. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>mention</b> that the room for the clinical exam was small and had very standard lighting conditions. We did not use the flash and obtained pictures with a 3, 008 × 2, 000 resolution.|$|R
50|$|Among the operatic composers {{that worked}} in Cuba {{during the first}} half of the 19th century we can mention the Spanish José María Trespuentes and Narciso Téllez, as well as the Italian Enea Elia. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>mention</b> two other renowned Italian composers, which arrived at a very young age to Havana to work as {{instrumental}} performers during the season of 1846-1847, and stayed in Cuba several years. One of them, Giovanni Battista Bottesini, composed his first opera, named Colón in Cuba, in the Island; and the other composer, Luigi Arditi, also premiered his opera Gulnara in Cuba, only four days after Bottesinis.|$|R
40|$|In {{our studies}} on diet and blood {{pressure}} in normotensive volunteers (1) {{there was a slight}} decrease in blood pressure over time on almost all diets. Burstyn (2) suggests that this trend was due simply to the effect of repeated measurements and not to the diets them-selves. We completely agree with this sugges-tion and perhaps <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>mentioned</b> this possibility in our paper. However, in evaluating the effect of a specific diet we could eliminate the effect of time trends, whatever their origin, because in each exper-iment some of the subjects were randomized into a control group that received a constant diet throughout the trial. In such a design...|$|R
50|$|The painter Louis Dewis {{has just}} made a small {{exhibition}} of his works at the Galerie Marguy Paris, which has obtained the greatest and most legitimate success. This excellent painter, whose talent asserts itself at each new exhibition, this time gives us landscapes quite crowned with success. We must mention in particular: The Reapers, a very luminous work; The Canal at Bruges, of a character well interpreted; St. Jean de Luz, which shines with the sun of the South; The Stone Bridge at Rouen, etc., but <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> them all.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} photoionization {{processes}} involved in optical breakdown, which depend on the wavelength, local intensity, and pulse duration, {{as well as on}} the electronic structure of the material. First, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> that optical breakdown is only observed at very high intensities. For pulse durations greater than a few tens of fs avalanche ionization plays a role. The longer pulse duration, the greater the avalanche ionization’s contribution. Multi-photon ionization processes are important in the fs time regime, and their role increases as the pulse duration decreases. The type of multi-photon ionization processes involved is also wavelength dependent.|$|E
5000|$|Deprived of his post, Tissot {{was left}} still more free {{to attack the}} {{government}} in the press. He was {{one of the founders of}} the newspaper Le Constitutionnel, and of the review, the Minerve. Without laying stress on his literary works (Traité de la poésie latine, 1821; translation of the Bucolics, 3rd ed., 1823; Études sur Virgile, 1825) <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> the Mémoires historiques et militaires sur Carnot (on Lazare Carnot, which he based on the papers left by the [...] "Organizer of Victory"; 1824), the Discours du Général Foy (1826) and a Histoire de la guerre de la Péninsule - both inspired by General Foy (1827).|$|E
40|$|The reader {{should be}} warned {{that we have}} taken some liberties with {{terminology}} (especially the terms &quot;flock &quot; and &quot;herd&quot;) by redefining objects in a more general context. This was deemed necessary {{to avoid having to}} introduce a more cumbersome set of terms. However, the use of modifiers will insure that the new definitions are in agreement with the more commonly used ones in the appropriate context. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>mention</b> that <b>we</b> have restricted ourselves to the finite case only out of preference for that setting. Infinite analogs of almost everything that appears here do exist, but we shall leave it to others to develop these...|$|R
30|$|Most of the {{difference}} arises due to intensive fundamental Rayleigh mode generation {{in the case of}} a shallow source in the velocity model without a water layer. The velocity model including the water layer strongly suppresses fundamental mode (mode 0) generation, likely due to the fundamental mode having its largest amplitude at zero depth, i.e., on the contact surface of ground with the water layer. An additional layer of deep water above this surface suppresses Rayleigh fundamental mode generation. To the contrary, a higher mode has its largest amplitudes at some depth and the water layer has only a small effect. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>mention</b> that shallow sources easily generate fundamental mode surface waves, while deeper sources generate higher modes.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{production and}} decay of the Λ_c^+ hyperon. The production considered {{is through the}} e^+e^- annihilation channel, e^+e^-→Λ_c^+ Λ̅_c^-, with summation over the Λ̅_c^- anti-hyperon spin directions. It is in this situation that the Λ_c^+ decay chain is identified. Two kinds of sequential decays are studied. The first one is the doubly weak decay B_ 1 → B_ 2 M_ 2, followed by B_ 2 → B_ 3 M_ 3. The other one is the mixed weak-electromagnetic decay B_ 1 → B_ 2 M_ 2, followed by B_ 2 → B_ 3 γ. In both schemes B denotes baryons and M mesons. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>mention</b> that the initial state of the Λ_c^+ hyperon is polarized. Comment: Added applicatio...|$|R
50|$|After {{the provincial}} {{restructuring}} made in 1833, either in Rascafría or Oteruelo, which {{were part of}} Segovia, turned {{to belong to the}} province of Madrid. The vegetative growth continued increasing and their principal source of income kept being the cattle industry and agriculture, with a minimum industrial activity. In 1975 the township of Oteruelo disappeared and annexed to Rascafría, which enhanced its population up to 1218 people. However, before Oteruelo joined Rascafría, the number of residents living there was just 208 people, who made a living working in different posts.Among the edifices build in that period, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> the schools, situated {{in the northern part of}} the village, next to the road.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{the above}} founders of Claridade, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> two other very {{important}} contributors: painter and critic Jaime de Figueiredo and writer João Lopes, who cooperated immensely at {{early stages of}} the magazine. Additionally, throughout the existence of Claridade several other bilingual writers contributed greatly to the magazine’s development, in particular, and to modern Cape Verde literature in general. They were Pedro Corsino de Azevedo and José Osório de Oliveira on the first issues, and Henrique Teixeira de Sousa, Félix Monteiro, Nuno Miranda, Sergio Frusoni, Abílio Duarte, Arnaldo França, Corsino Fortes, Tomás Martins, Virgílio Pires, Onésimo Silveira, Francisco Xavier da Cruz, Artur Augusto, Virgílio de Melo, Luís Romano de Madeira Melo, among others, in other published magazine issues.|$|E
50|$|The {{members of}} the second {{generation}} of Cuban musicologists that appeared during the Cuban Revolution period, graduated in their great majority either from the Havana Municipal Conservatory or the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA), which from 1976 offered the first Musicology Degree {{in the history of}} Cuba. Many of them worked at a later time at the newly created Centro para la investigación y desarrollo de la música cubana (CIDMUC), founded in 1978.From this group <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>mention</b> two renowned musicologists that frequently worked in collaboration with each other: Victoria Elí (b. 1945) and Zoila Gómez (b. 1948). We should also mention Tamahra Martín (b. 1945), who dedicated two books to the Cuban choral music: “La música coral en Cuba” (1987) and “Música Coral” (1990).|$|E
40|$|To the editor, We are {{thankful to}} Jiang and colleagues for their {{critical}} appraisal of our paper. This pilot study fulfills {{a range of}} important functions, and can provide valuable insights for other researchers. There {{is a need for}} more discussion amongst researchers of both the process and outcomes of such studies. I agree that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>mentioned</b> in our con-clusion that this study showed the beneficial role of vitamin D in patients with knee osteoarthritis, especially those with insufficient vitamin D. Whether vitamin D is effective for all knee osteoarthritis patients requires more randomized controlled trials with on a broader patient population than we included.

5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>mention</b> {{that within}} the album, there are two covers of high quality: In the first, Elisa made a Spanish version of the item {{entitled}} [...] "Everything I Own", a song originally performed by David Gate, renamed in this adaptation that Elisa did as [...] "Cada Día Mucho Más" [...] (Every day More Much) a version where the naked ear it feels the influence of reggae music. And the second cover, this time the song [...] "Groovin'", original of UB-40 group, renamed in Spanish as [...] "Vive, Siente" [...] (Lives, Feels). This album also has 2 bonus tracks and they are these same songs sung in Spanish; but in English this time sung {{in the voice of}} Elisa Rego.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>should</b> also <b>mention</b> that <b>we</b> {{generated}} only single frames for classification and not nine or eleven {{for context}} {{as in other}} studies [38, 47]. We leave those experiments for future work on purpose, because our goal here {{is to focus on}} the usefulness of the CNN as a feature extractor for small datasets, contrary to the popular belief that the CNN requires a lot of data. To satisfy the readers curiosity, after 30 training epochs, the CNN settled at a cross-entropy loss of 1.0533. Also, it took less than half an hour to execute the CNN on a computer with 8 GB of RAM and conventional hardware (Intel i 7). We believe this information is important because it shows that this careful technique can be applied even in low-resource scenarios.|$|R
