40|$|An {{efficient}} way to find the <b>workability</b> <b>limit</b> for powder metallurgy parts has been suggested. Compacts of Al- 4 %TiC, Al- 4 %WC, Al- 4 %Fe 3 C, and Al- 4 %Mo 2 C were produced to the relative density of 0. 82 and 0. 86 with three different geometries through primary operations of powder metallurgy routes. Each sintered compact was hot deformed to various strain levels till a visible crack appeared at the free surface. Oyane’s fracture principle was used to develop a theory to study powder metallurgy compacts. A least square technique {{was used to determine}} the constants in fracture criteria and these equations were finally used to find <b>workability</b> <b>limit.</b> It is found that the projected technique was well in agreement with the experimental values...|$|E
40|$|Information on {{workability}} limits {{is highly}} valuable {{at the farm}} level to help the farmer in deciding when and possibly how to carry out tillage. On higher levels (e. g. on regional scale) this knowledge will form a basis for obtaining guidelines with respect to required number of tractors, equipment etc. and so help in planning and policy making. Data of this kind are often lacking. The study reported here is the laboratory component of research {{carried out in the}} tropical area of Veracruz, Mexico. In this study, laboratory methods to determine workability limits were assessed for a typical clay and loam soil. For the dry <b>workability</b> <b>limit</b> (where energy for producing specifically sized aggregates is the decisive factor), the drop test was applied. Results in terms of soil moisture tension at the point of lowest energy expenditure were comparable with the field results. although energy levels were different. For the determination of the wet <b>workability</b> <b>limit</b> (WWL), an air permeability test and a compression test were used. Both tests yielded limits that were very close to the ones determined in the field. The compressibility test allows the assessment of other soil characteristics such as prediction of modification of pF curve and aeration properties under compressive forces. For field or farm scale, workability limits can be obtained from representative areas and then used in combination with water balance models to determine the number of workable days under a certain weather (rainfall) regime. The applicability on a regional scale is as yet more difficult, soil physical information from soil maps is usually not sufficient to allow reliable interpretations. The use of existing pedo-transfer functions to obtain input for models to predict workable days did not produce satisfactory results. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{state of}} {{compactness}} of the arable soil layer changes {{during the growing}} season as a result of tillage and traction. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess and predict some soil mechanical and physical properties governing machine performance and crop response. The following mechanical properties were studied: compressibility, workability and cone index, CI, the latter as indicator of load-bearing capacity or root penetration resistance. Compressibility of the soil could be described as a semi-log function of pressure versus air volume and moisture content, with texture-specific coefficients for three representative soils, in the range of 6 – 35 ir content. The wet <b>workability</b> <b>limit</b> for 16 Dutch soils was reached when the compaction process turned from "dry" into "wet" at 408 kPa of pressure. Soil rebound after pressure release was taken into account and quantified. Semi-log relations were found for CI versus porosity and moisture. Other physical properties were also studied and it was found that the nature of the pF curve of three representative soils (for seven levels of bulk density) was highly affected by the initial seven pressure–moisture combinations. The "effectivity" of the pore system, indicating the effect of tortuosity and discontinuity on the oxygen diffusion rate, turned out to be proportional to air content in the range of 6 – 25 &Eth;Critical machine and plant related limits for aeration and mechanical resistance, CI, are available from the literature. Aeration is associated with minimum values for air volume and oxygen diffusion rate, respectively. Using this information, CI was associated with minimum values for load-bearing capacity and maximum values for root penetration...|$|E

40|$|A split {{hopper barge}} is a {{dredging}} vessel that can split over its longitudinal axis to discharge its cargo. To allow {{for such an}} operation, the barge consists of two half-hulls that are connected by hinges {{at the top and}} hydraulic cylinders at the bottom. Any forces that act at the interface between the half-hulls have to be transferred by the hinges and cylinders as a result. The aim of this thesis is to develop a method to determine the <b>workability</b> <b>limits</b> of split hopper barges in irregular seas. For this workability of the barge, the design limits of the hinges and hydraulic cylinders are assumed to be governing. A quasi-static model is formulated {{to determine the effects of}} roll, different types of cargo, opening the barge and discharging the cargo on the forces in the hinges and cylinders. The results of the quasi-static model are a set of governing load cases for the split hopper barge. From the quasi-static model, it is found that the forces of interest are the largest for a closed split hopper barge and that either a solid or a liquid cargo will yield the governing load case. To account for the dynamics in irregular sea conditions, a calculation method is proposed based on Ansys AQWA. Since AQWA is not able to account for liquid cargo motions, its effects are incorporated separately. Using WAMIT simulations, the influences of the liquid cargo to the added mass and stiffness of the barge are determined. Based on the WAMIT results the AQWA model is adjusted. Superimposing the results from the quasi-static and dynamic models, the maximum forces in the hinges and hydraulic cylinders are obtained for the governing load cases. By comparing the obtained maximum forces to the design forces, a conclusion on the <b>workability</b> <b>limits</b> of the split hopper barge is drawn. For the barge carrying a solid cargo only one resonance frequency is found, while, due to the liquid cargo motions, the barge with a liquid cargo has two resonance frequencies. As a result, a larger number of combinations of wave directions and periods yield considerable forces. For a 3 -hour-extreme with a significant wave height of 3 meters, the governing hydraulic cylinder forces are found for a barge carrying a liquid cargo. The maximum resulting hinge forces however, are found for a barge carrying a solid cargo. Because the limits of the hinges are exceeded before the limits of the hydraulic cylinders, it is concluded that the <b>workability</b> <b>limits</b> of the split hopper barge in irregular waves are most limited, and therefore governing, for a barge carrying a solid cargo...|$|R
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{behind this}} study is the lack of specialized analysis regarding internal failure caused by the adiabatic shear hand (ASB) phenomenon in the cold-headed products. Its aim was to present an integrated workability study to improve and assist cold-heading (CH) multistage design procedures to replace the current design rules of thumb, as they are neither effective nor adequate in fulfilling the needs of the new developments in the rapidly expanding CH industry. To achieve these goals, a comprehensive testing methodology and FE modeling, implemented within ABAQUS/Explicit, were established. This methodology includes an instrumented Drop Weight Compression Test (DWCT) tower equipped with a guided pocket die-set configuration capable of developing internal failure at different stages of ASBs and integrated metallographic inspection techniques. A validated FE model of the DWCT and guided pocket die-set configuration was a valuable tool in establishing the failure criteria and indicating the <b>workability</b> <b>limits.</b> A detailed experimental and FE study for the ASB stages in the CH process was introduced to uncover the affect of different parameters controlling the failure mechanisms within the ASBs in the CH process. This study investigated the effect of the thermal, geometric and the material flow softening and hardening mechanisms affecting ASB evolution. Moreover, a detailed metallurgical and FE study of the internal ductile and Transformed Adiabatic Shear Band (TASB) failures caused by the ASB phenomenon in DWCT was conducted. Three ductile failure criteria were introduced to predict the initiation and location of the internal ductile failure in the ASBs. One TASB failure criteria was introduced to predict the phase transformation to undesirable brittle martensite. These failure criteria were employed to establish integrated workability methodologies to indicate the objective <b>workability</b> <b>limits.</b> Applying these <b>workability</b> methodologies on multistage CH FE models showed that these methodologies are an efficient tool to predict the damage levels and failure initiation locations within the cold-headed bolts. Moreover, these methodologies were successful in optimizing the die designs in order to reduce damage levels...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{addition}} of fibers from end-of-life tires to commercial mortar mixtures. Two different types of mortar, one lime-plastic and other cement-fluid, are mixed with different percentage of fibers ranging from 0 % to 1 %. The changes in bulk density, consistency, compressive and flexural strength, dynamic Young modulus and water absorption are studied. According to the results, consistency is the property that shows more relevant changes for an addition of 0. 25 % fibers. Consistency is related to workability and affects the water absorption and the Young modulus values. On the contrary, bulk density and mechanical properties did not change with {{the addition of}} fibers. The results prove that this fiber, considered a waste from recycling of end-of-life tires, can be used in commercial mixtures without losing strength.

40|$|Cold <b>Workability</b> <b>limits</b> of Brass {{were studied}} as a {{function}} of friction, aspect ratio and specimen geometry. Five standard shapes of the axis symmetric specimens of cylindrical with aspect ratios 1. 0 and 1. 5, ring, tapered and flanged were selected for the present investigation. Specimens were deformed in compression between two flat platens to predict the metal flow at room temperature. The longitudinal and oblique cracks were obtained as the two major modes of surface fractures. Cylindrical and ring specimen shows the oblique surface crack while the tapered and flanged shows the longitudinal crack. Machine Vision system using PC based video recording with a CCD camera was used to analyze the deformation of 4 X 4 mm square grid marked at mid plane of the specimen. The strain paths obtained from different specimens exhibited nonlinearity from the beginning {{to the end of the}} strain path. The circumferential stress component θσ increasingly becomes tensile with continued deformation. On the other hand the axial stress zσ, increased in the very initial stages of deformation but started becoming less compressive immediately as barreling develops. The nature of hydrostatic stress on the rim of the flanged specimen was found to be tensile. Finite element software ANSYS has been applied for the analysis of the upset forming process. When the stress values obtained from finite element analysis were compared to the measurements of grids using Machine Vision system it was found that they were in close proximity...|$|R
40|$|Deformation {{processing}} of alloys with <b>limited</b> <b>workability</b> {{is one of}} the principal technological challenges for the metal manufacturing industry. Traditional processes (rolling, extrusion) are usually performed at high temperatures (0. 5 Tm) for increased plasticity and crack-free products, which makes them costly, energy intensive and raw material inefficient. In this thesis, extrusion machining (EM) a shear-type deformation process is applied to alloys with <b>limited</b> <b>workability</b> for sheet and foil production from bulk forms in a single step. EM is shown to have a narrowly confined deformation zone with much wider control of deformation than in conventional deformation processing (e. g., severe plastic deformation). Controllable deformation parameters include strain, strain rate, hydrostatic pressure, temperature and deformation path. These attributes are highlighted in deformation {{processing of}} two classes of <b>limited</b> <b>workability</b> alloys: 1) Alloys with intrinsic susceptibility to cracking (and segmentation) due to flow localization and shear band formation and 2) Alloys with extrinsic susceptibility to cracking due to macroscopic defects such as porosity, casting defects and weak second phases. Magnesium AZ 31 alloy is selected as a model material for the first class and sintered copper, cast brass alloy 360 and cast Mg AZ 31 are selected for the second class. Noteworthy features of the process are: suppression of segmentation by combinations of high hydrostatic pressures (p/ 2 k 3 ̆e 1. 2) and deformation temperatures (T 3 ̆e 0. 5 Tm) realized by in-situ plastic heating, realization of a range of strains and deformation rates, engineering of microstructures ranging from conventional to ultrafine grained, shear type deformation textures (non-basal in the case of Mg AZ 31) and creation of sheet from the bulk in a single step of deformation without pre-heating. The thermo-mechanical conditions and microstructural processes (e. g. continuous dynamic recrystallization for Mg AZ 31) that are responsible for continuous and sound sheet products are established. Guidelines for scalability and cost-effectiveness of EM for commercial production are analyzed and discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Since cement-based {{composites}} {{have been}} used for more than one century in civil and other engineering areas, a relevant number of international and local standards has been produced in order to ensure the quality and durability of employed materials and, so, structural safety for users. Among all meaningful chemical, physical and mechanical properties early age properties represent a key parameter to predict the extent of early age cracking risk, {{which is one of the}} main causes of reduction in service life (the so-called "Vita Nominale" in Italian Structural Code Ministerial Decree 14 / 01 / 2008) respect to design hypothesis. The knowledge of shrinkage phenomena, which are deformations associated to the complex chemical reactions of cementitious materials, is related to the reliability of the measurement method and, if a proper measure is accomplished, an adequate mitigation strategy can be chosen among existing alternatives (shrinkage reducing admixtures, internal curing, superabsorbent polymers, etc.). Geopolymer matrices represent one of the main sustainable alternatives to traditional cementitious binders such as ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and other clinker-based materials offering several potential advantages like higher fire resistance, durability, etc. At the moment, real scale applications are limited and, so, a relevant amount of data is still needed to assess the actual early age and long-term behavior of these systems. Particularly, the early-age monitoring of geopolymers represent a key parameter for mix design optimization. In order to assist in describing these processes, which are related to complex chemistry and drying phenomena, in this paper we have simultaneously measured the early-age shrinkage and temperature changes of metakaolin-based geopolymers by using Fiber Bragg Grating FBG-based sensors. Furthermore, we have evaluated <b>workability</b> <b>limits</b> respect to designed layout, in order to reduce the risk of excessive entrapped air, which could affect measurement accuracy.

40|$|The {{workability}} {{of floating}} construction equipment {{is one of}} the elements in the construction phasing of the design of the Ashdod port extension in the south of Israel by DHV Consultancy and Engineering. Waves {{play an important role in}} the workability of floating equipment, since they induce motions to floating equipment with the possibility of adverse effects on the workability. For the purpose of assessing the workability of this equipment in relation to the wave climate during several critical phases of the construction, wave modelling should provide insight. A recent development is the availability of Boussinesq-type models for this type of studies. Boussinesq-type models are phase-resolving, which means that they describe the individual wave behaviour. This gives Boussinesq-type wave models the capability of describing wave propagation in relatively shallow regions (e. g. harbours and foreshores), where nonlinear effects and dispersion play an important role. Boussinesq-type wave models are suited to deal with complex harbour geometries, including modelling of diffraction, partial reflection and wave-wave interactions. In this study, it is investigated whether TRITON, an experimental Boussinesq-type wave model currently under development at Deltares, is suitable for the purpose of workability assessment of floating equipment. The suitability of TRITON depends on aspects like the applicability of Boussinesq-type models in general, the correctness of results and the computational effort for TRITON. As part of this study, the results of TRITON are compared with measurement data from a physical scale model of Ashdod port, which was mainly set-up for measuring moored vessel motions. For the validation of TRITON for the purpose of workability assessments, the Ashdod port extension is used as a case study. The plausible floating equipment scenario for the construction phasing of the Ashdod port extension (consisting of typical dredgers, stone dumpers and crane barges) is sensitive for primary waves within a peak period range of 5 - 12 s. The estimation of the <b>workability</b> <b>limits</b> of the plausible equipment is based on a combination of ship motion theory, information from contractors and personal communication with experts. Based on the present study, TRITON is considered technically capable for the purpose of workability assessments in port applications. The appropriateness for using TRITON in this type of application is however limited by the application range of TRITON – due to the mathematical background of Boussinesq-type models – and by computation times. msc thesisHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Variations in workability and bar ductility were correlated to variations in incipient melting temperature and gamma prime solvus, both of which varied with cobalt content. Heat treatments were defined to yield, as far as possible, similar structures from alloy to alloy. At the lowest cobalt levels N- 115 <b>workability</b> was severely <b>limited</b> and the alloys could not be worked to bar.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of silica and alumina {{contents}} on setting, phase development, and physical properties of high calcium fly ash (ASTM Class C) geopolymers. The characteristic rapid setting properties and, hence, <b>limited</b> <b>workability</b> range of high calcium fly ash geopolymers has restricted both development and potential application of these binder systems compared to conventional geopolymer binders derived from bituminous coal, i. e., (ASTM Class F) sources or from calcined kaolin feedstocks. For this study, control of setting and hardening properties were investigated by adjusting SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio of the starting mix, via series of mixes formulated with varying SiO 2 or Al 2 O 3 contents to achieve SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 in the range 2. 87 - 4. 79. Foremost is the observation that {{the effect of}} varying silica and alumina in high calcium fly ash systems on setting and hardening properties is markedly different from that observed for traditional Class F geopolymer systems. Overall, increases in either silica or alumina content appear to shorten the setting time of high calcium-based systems unlike conventional geopolymer systems where increasing Al 2 O 3 accelerates setting. The setting process was associated primarily with CSH or CASH formation. Furthermore, {{there appears to be a}} prevailing SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio that prolongs setting, rather than Ca 2 + ion content itself, while NASH primarily contributes to strength development. SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratios in the range of 3. 20 - 3. 70 resulted in products with highest strengths and longest setting times. These results suggest that initial predominance of Ca 2 + ions and its reactions effectively help maintaining a SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio at which amorphous geopolymer phase is stable to influence setting and initial strength development...|$|R
40|$|The {{stochastic}} volatility (SV) models had {{not been}} popular as the ARCH (autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) models in practical applications until recent years even though the SV models have close relationship to financial economic theories. The main {{reason is that the}} likelihood of the SV models is not easy to evaluate unlike the ARCH models. Developments of Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) methods have increased the popularity of Bayesian inference in many fields of research including the SV models. After Jacquire et al. (1994) applied a Bayesian analysis for estimating the SV model in their epoch making work, the Bayesian approach has greatly contributed to the research on the SV models. The classical analysis based on the likelihood for estimating the (SV) model has been extensively studied in the recent years. Danielson (1994) approximates the marginal likelihood of the observable process by simulating the latent volatility conditional on the available information. Shephard and Pitt (1997) gave an idea of evaluating likelihood by exploiting sampled volatility. Durbin and Koopman (1997) explored the idea of Shephard and Pitt (1997) and evaluated the likelihood by Monte-Carlo integration. Sandmann and Koopman (1998) applied this method for the SV model. Durbin and Koopman (2000) reviewed the methods of Monte Carlo maximum likelihood from both Bayesian and classical perspectives. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose the Laplace approximation (LA) method to the nonlinear state space representation, and to show that the LA method is workable for estimating the SV models including the multivariate SV model and the dynamic bivariate mixture (DBM) model. The SV model can be regarded as a nonlinear state space model. The LA method approximates the logarithm of the joint density of current observation and volatility conditional on the past observations by the second order Taylor expansion around its mode, and then applies the nonlinear filtering algorithm. This idea of approximation is found in Shephard and Pitt (1997) and Durbin and Koopmann (1997). The Monte-Carlo Likelihood (MCL: Sandmann and Koopman (1998)) is now a standard classical method for estimating the SV models. It is based on importance sampling technique. Importance sampling is regarded as an exact method for maximum likelihood estimation. We show that the LA method of this paper approximates the weight function by unity in the context of importance sampling. We do not need to carry out the Monte Carlo integration for obtaining the likelihood since the approximate likelihood function can be analytically obtained. If one-step ahead prediction density of observation and volatility variables conditional on the past observations is sufficiently accurately approximated, the LA method is workable. We examine how the LA method works by simulations as well as various empirical studies. We conduct the Monte-Carlo simulations for the univariate SV model for examining the small sample properties and compare them with those of other methods. Simulation experiments reveals that our method is comparable to the MCL, Maximum Likelihood (Fridman and Harris (1998)) and MCMC methods. We apply this method to the univariate SV models with normal distribution or t-distribution, the bivariate SV model and the dynamic bivariate mixture model, and empirically illustrate how the LA method works for each of the extended models. The empirical results on the stock markets reveal that our method provides very similar estimates of coefficients to those of the MCL. As a result, this paper demonstrates that the LA method is workable in two ways: simulation studies and empirical studies. Naturally, the <b>workability</b> is <b>limited</b> to the cases we have examined. But we believe the LA method is applicable to many SV models based on our study of this paperStochastic volatility, Nonlinear state space representation...|$|R
