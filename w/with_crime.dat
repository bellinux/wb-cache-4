Metro's attempts to reduce crime, combined with how the station environments were designed <b>with</b> <b>crime</b> prevention in mind, has contributed to Metro being among the safest and cleanest subway systems in the United States. There are nearly 6,000 video surveillance cameras used across the system to enhance security.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, Southeast D.C. {{has been}} synonymous <b>with</b> <b>crime</b> and violence, and {{has one of}} the highest crime rates in the District of Columbia (albeit not the highest rates in all {{categories}} of crimes). Concern about crime at the Anacostia, Congress Heights, and Southern Avenue stations has existed for many years, although statistics only partially support these concerns. Fear of crime was one of the reasons why, in 1991, Prince George's County residents fought bus route changes that would have forced riders to disembark at Anacostia Station.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{federal highway}} {{subsidies}} and postwar development encouraged outward migration as residents moved to gain newer housing; this suburbanization significantly reduced the city's middle-class population. The city made {{efforts to create}} new attractions, such as the Gateway Arch, which construction became a focus {{of the civil rights}} movement to gain non-segregated jobs in the skilled trades. The first litigation under the 1964 Civil Rights Act was against St. Louis unions. The city worked to replace substandard housing by new public housing projects such as PruittIgoe. A combination of factors resulted in this being notoriously unsuccessful, and it was demolished in the late 20th century. Starting in the 1980s and continuing into the following century, construction and gentrification have increased in some areas of St. Louis, particularly downtown. City beautification and crime reduction have made progress, although St. Louis has continued to struggle <b>with</b> <b>crime</b> and perceptions of crime. The city saw modest population growth during the mid-2000s, but showed a decline in the 2010 U.S. Census.|$|E

5|$|George Wilkes (1817– September 23, 1885) was an American {{journalist}} and newspaper editor. A native of New York, Wilkes became a {{journalist and}} after losing a libel case was imprisoned in New York City's jail; his imprisonment led him to write a pamphlet on the jail's conditions in 1844. The next year, Wilkes and a friend started publishing National Police Gazette, a newspaper dealing <b>with</b> <b>crime</b> reporting and other sensationalistic topics. In 1856 Wilkes bought a sporting newspaper called The Spirit of the Times, which he had previously worked for. After selling the Gazette, Wilkes continued to publish and edit the Spirit {{until his death in}} 1885. Wilkes also wrote a couple of books on non-sporting topics as well as introducing pari-mutuel betting into the United States.|$|E

As a means of dealing <b>with</b> <b>crime</b> in the area (including violence, police corruption and the infiltration by organized crime), he introduced a bill into the Massachusetts General Court that would have legalized the sex-for-hire business but kept it quarantined in a red light district, which would have been moved to Boston’s Financial District. The bill, which had the support of Boston’s Police Commissioner, never came up for a vote. Later, when Frank was running for Congress, opponents erroneously portrayed him as having attempted to permit red-light districts in all Bay State communities.|$|E
