25|$|Paddington on Albion Street: in 1925, with an {{enrolment}} of 421, Sydney Tech High {{was transferred}} to Albion Street, Paddington. Although it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> of expansion, it was a vigorous P campaign that encouraged the State Government to fund an entirely new site for the school.|$|E
25|$|He {{wrote his}} sermons out fully before he preached, {{but what he}} carried up to the pulpit <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> card with an outline sketch. Stenographers would take down the sermon as it was {{delivered}} and Spurgeon would then have opportunity to make revisions to the transcripts the following day for immediate publication. His weekly sermons, which sold for a penny each, were widely circulated and still remain {{one of the all-time}} best selling series of writings published in history.|$|E
25|$|In 1825 John Limbird was {{interested}} in founding a Mechanics' Newspaper with Robertson. The project was diverted by the intervention of John Gast's committee, becoming the Trades Newspaper of 1825 to 1827. Robertson was squared by being made editor, a decision unacceptable to Francis Place, who thought Robertson {{was not to be}} trusted, and wanted Edward Baines. In radical politics, Robertson and Hodgskin actually differed in their analysis. When Labour Defended, Hodgskin's landmark pamphlet, was reviewed in the Newspaper in 1825, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> of dissent from Robertson on fixed capital. This attitude diminished the ground on which Hodgskin was innovative. On the other hand, his ideas were quickly spread through the paper. Place attacked Robertson in consequence, in the Artizan.|$|E

John's son Charles Edward Anthon (1822-1883) {{made a name}} for himself as a numismatist. Another of his sons, William Henry Anthon (1827-1875), <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>noted</b> lawyer.|$|R
500|$|One of Kaczynski's tactics {{was leaving}} false clues in every bomb. He would {{deliberately}} make them {{hard to find}} to mislead investigators into thinking they had a clue. The first clue was a metal plate stamped with the initials [...] "FC" [...] hidden somewhere (usually in the pipe end cap) in every bomb. One false clue he left <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> in a bomb that did not detonate which reads [...] "Wu—It works! I told you it would—RV". Another clue was the Eugene O'Neill $1 stamps used to send his boxes. One of his bombs was sent embedded in a copy of Sloan Wilson's novel Ice Brothers.|$|E
500|$|One offbeat {{feature of}} the {{magazine}} was the habit of including very short (less than a page) vignettes of fiction, usually but not always relating to the cover, without credit. These were most probably {{the work of the}} editor in many cases, though Frank Belknap Long wrote several of these for the inside front cover of the magazine. There was never a letter column, though in the very last issue there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> that one was planned for future issues. The book review column, always titled [...] "Universe in Books", appeared fairly regularly but was liable to be dropped if {{there was no room for}} it. It was originally signed [...] "The Editor", and was presumably written by Sam Merwin; Robert Frazier took the column on when Merwin left at the end of 1953. Santesson took over in October 1955 and wrote every column that appeared from that point on. After the first few issues, which contained editorial essays from both editor and publisher, the editorials disappeared, though Santesson did sometimes fill a blank space with a few editorial comments.|$|E

2500|$|A {{note was}} found inside a B·B {{fountain}} pen. Poison {{was found on}} the cap. The note inside the pen contained clues to the combination of a lock box. Not in the mood for playing games, the police forced the lock box open. Inside was a View-Master with several rolls of film of Mexico and a stack of papers. Under the stack of papers <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> confessing to the Texarkana killings. The note read: ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{suicide note}} was not {{discovered}} {{during the initial}} investigation, but a note was later discovered in another Bible that had been included in Benoit's possessions that were sent to his first wife. According to professional wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer, [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> that {{was found in a}} Bible by the mother of Chris's two children (Martina Benoit) who lives in Canada. The Bible was mixed in with Chris's personal belongings that were shipped to them." [...] Chris Benoit's father Michael Benoit stated, [...] "He had a hand-written notation in there saying 'I'm preparing to leave this Earth.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 1930, {{shortly after}} his {{indictment}} on bribery charges, Crawford was baptized and admitted into the membership of St. Paul’s Presbyterian Church. [...] The pastor at St. Paul’s was Rev. Gustav A. Briegleb, the noted minister portrayed by John Malkovich in the 2008 film Changeling. [...] On {{the day of his}} baptism, Crawford [...] placed a ring set with two large diamonds, and valued at $3,500, in the collection plate at Briegleb’s church. [...] Accompanying the ring <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> from Crawford asking Briegleb to sell the ring and use the proceeds to help build a parish house.|$|E

2500|$|When [...] "To Erskine" [...] was {{published}} in the 1 December 1794 Morning Chronicle, a note addressed to the editor was printed before it and read: [...] "If, Sir, the following Poems will not disgrace your poetical department, I will transmit you a series of Sonnets (as it is the fashion to call them), addressed, like these, to eminent Contemporaries." [...] Following the poem <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> by the editor that read, [...] "Our elegant Correspondent will highly gratify every reader of taste by the continuance of his exquisitely beautiful productions. No. II. shall appear on an early day." ...|$|E
2500|$|By this time, Mortier's and Wellesley's cavalry {{were already}} bickering near Navalmoral only about [...] west of Oropesa. On 3 August, the French {{horsemen}} captured a Spanish courier carrying {{a message from}} Wellesley to General William Erksine at Lisbon in which Soult's forces were estimated at only 12,000 men. Soult saw that Wellesley was marching right into his hands. Luckily for the Allies, Spanish guerillas caught a French agent near Ávila and delivered his message to Cuesta on the 3rd. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> from Soult to Joseph, informing the king that he was advancing with over 30,000 soldiers. Cuesta quickly passed along the message to Wellesley.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 October 2012, Cherrytree Records/Universal Russia {{announced}} {{that they would be}} issuing a special re-release of t.A.T.u's 200 km/h in the Wrong Lane.

2500|$|Loos {{returned}} to California just as Griffith, {{who wanted to}} make longer films, was leaving Triangle, and she joined director and future husband John Emerson for a string of successful Douglas Fairbanks films. Loos and company realized that Douglas Fairbanks' acrobatics were an extension of his effervescent personality and parlayed his natural athletic ability into swashbuckling adventure roles. His Picture in the Papers (1916) was noted for its wry style of discursive and witty subtitles: [...] "My most popular subtitle introduced {{the name of a}} new character. The name was something like this: 'Count Xxerkzsxxv.' Then there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>note,</b> 'To those of you who read titles aloud, you can't pronounce the Count's name. You can only think it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|One threat a {{journalist}} faced <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>note</b> placed on her car by someone {{belonging to the}} Tupamaros. The note was titled, [...] "Operation Defense of the Socialist Revolution, Anti-Imperialist, and Madurista Chavista" [...] said that her actions [...] "promote destabilizing actions of fascist groups and stateless persons who seek to overthrow the legitimate government of President Nicolas Maduro, probably financed and paid by the squalid and bourgeois right have burned the country". They gave the reporter and ultimatum saying they knew {{where she and her}} family stayed telling her to [...] "immediately stop communication" [...] or she would suffer consequences in order to [...] "enforce the Constitution and keep alive the legacy of our supreme commander and eternal Hugo Chavez".|$|E
