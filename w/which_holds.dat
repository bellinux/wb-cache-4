40|$|A {{formalism}} {{is presented}} for tracking assertions <b>which</b> <b>hold</b> universally, i. e., {{at the end}} of all the execution paths to a given program point, and assertions <b>which</b> <b>hold</b> existentially, i. e., {{at the end of}} some execution paths. In the formalism, the assertions <b>which</b> <b>hold</b> at a given execution path are uniformly defined by an entry environment which contains the assertions <b>which</b> <b>hold</b> when the execution of the program begins and an environment transformer for every program construct. The novel aspect of our formalism is that Horn clauses are used to specify the consistent environments and the meaning of program constructs. The best iterative algorithm (a notion defined by P. Cousot and R. Cousot) for tracking universal and existential assertions simultaneously is given. Conditions are presented under which the best iterative algorithm can be efficiently implemented. The formalism is applied to the pointer equality problem in Pascal. It is shown that universal pointer equalities may be used [...] ...|$|R
