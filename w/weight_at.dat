5|$|The {{tactical}} methods {{had been}} {{tested by the}} Australians in a local counter-attack at the Battle of Hamel on 4 July. The German defenders of Hamel were deeply dug in, and their position commanded a very wide field of fire. Similar positions had resisted capture for two months in the Battle of the Somme. The Australians had used surprise rather than <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> Hamel. The artillery had opened fire only {{at the moment the}} infantry and tanks advanced, and the Germans were rapidly overrun.|$|E
5|$|Aluminium {{cylinders}} {{are usually}} manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets {{in a process}} which first presses the walls and base, then trims {{the top edge of}} the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength, but the extra <b>weight</b> <b>at</b> the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1873 {{started a}} five-year {{shipping}} depression that strained the finances {{of all of}} the Atlantic competitors. In 1876 the mail contracts expired and the Post Office ended both Cunard's and Inman's subsidies. The new contracts were paid on the basis of <b>weight,</b> <b>at</b> a rate substantially higher than paid by the United States Post Office. Cunard's weekly New York mail sailings were reduced to one and White Star was awarded the third mail sailing.

40|$|The data {{analysed}} {{consisted of}} body <b>weight</b> records <b>at</b> birth, and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 {{months of age}} of 549 half Friesian x Bunaji crossbred heifers collected over a twenty-five year period (1965 - 1989). Least squares means ± s. e. of body <b>weights</b> <b>at</b> birth, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age were 26. 7 ± 1. 3, 72. 4 ± 4. 5, 112. 9 ± 6. 9, 147. 2 ± 9. 2 and 182. 1 ± 11. 1 kg, respectively. Year of birth was highly significant(p< 0. 01) in affecting body <b>weights</b> <b>at</b> all ages, while the effect of month of birth was not. Seasonal influence on birth weight and body <b>weights</b> <b>at</b> 3 and 6 months of age was significant(p< 0. 05). Phenotypic correlations between body <b>weights</b> <b>at</b> all ages were positive and highly significant(p< 0. 01), ranging from 0. 30 to 0. 79. The {{results of this study}} showed that the beneficial effect of crossbreeding Friesian with Bunaji cattle was reflected in the growth performance of the F 1 crosses, since they grew faster than the indigenous Bunaji from birth to yearling age. The study also indicated that heifer selection for yearling body weight can be done early on the basis of <b>weights</b> <b>at</b> 3 and 6 months of age...|$|R
5|$|The {{design of}} a Dive Coaster can vary {{slightly}} from one to another. Depending on the amusement park's request, one row on the train can seat anywhere from 6 to 10 riders. Stadium seating {{is also used to}} give every rider a clear view. Next, compared to standard Bolliger & Mabillard 4 abreast cars, because of the extra weight of each car on a Dive Coaster, the size of the track must be larger than other B models (such as the Hyper Coaster) to support the <b>weight.</b> <b>At</b> the top of the primary vertical drop, a braking system holds the train for 3 to 5 seconds, giving riders a view of the drop ahead before being released into the drop.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have low}} basal {{metabolic}} rates (BMR), which helps them to conserve energy {{during the dry}} season, when water and food are scarce. They can optimize their energy use by lowering their metabolic rate to 20% below the values predicted for mammals of similar body mass. The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), for instance, reportedly {{has one of the}} lowest metabolic rates among mammals. Its low metabolic rate may be linked to its generally folivorous diet and relatively small body mass. Lemurs exhibit behavioral adaptations to complement this trait, including sunning behaviors, hunched sitting, group huddling, and nest sharing, in order to reduce heat loss and conserve energy. Dwarf lemurs and mouse lemurs exhibit seasonal cycles of dormancy to conserve energy. Before dry season, they will accumulate fat in white adipose tissue located {{at the base of the}} tail and hind legs, doubling their <b>weight.</b> <b>At</b> the end of the dry season, their body mass may fall to half of what it was prior to the dry season. Lemurs that do not experience states of dormancy are also able to shut down aspects of their metabolism for energy conservation.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Artillery Monument {{attempted}} {{a very different}} effect. Jagger takes a realist approach to his figures, embracing detailed images of military power {{with none of the}} classical symbolism of other monuments, or even Jagger's own pre-war pieces. The art historian Reginald Wilenski likens the memorial to the work of Frank Brangwyn, who focused on depicting the physical labour of soldiers and workers during the war. The memorial shows the three upright bronze figures stood at ease, rather than to attention; the driver even leans back against the parapet, his cape hanging over his outstretched arms, suggesting an attitude of exhaustion or contemplation. The faceless, heavily laden statue of the fallen soldier appears less at rest than tired, pulled down as if by a great <b>weight.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, the sheer size of the memorial, including the oversized gun and the larger-than-life bronze figures, exudes a sense of strength and power; the figures are stocky, confident and imposing. This strength and power contributes to the sense of masculinity that pervades the work, from the phallic image of the howitzer, to the solid, muscular figures of the gunners.|$|E
