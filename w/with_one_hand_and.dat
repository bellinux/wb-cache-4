5|$|When {{mechanical}} engineer Robert Fulton {{went to see}} the machine, he noticed that the machine was unsteady as if someone would have powered it manually and irregularly with a crank. Fulton also detected that the sound was uneven, uncharacteristic of a machine's motions. He announced the machine was a fraud, and challenged Redheffer exclaiming he would expose the secret power source, otherwise he would pay for all the damage he would cause. Redheffer agreed, so Fulton removed some boards from the wall alongside the machine and exposed a catgut cord that led to the upper floor. Upstairs he found an old man who was turning a hand-crank <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> eating bread with the other. Spectators realized they had been duped and destroyed the machine; Redheffer fled the city.|$|E
25|$|Dribbling is {{the act of}} {{bouncing}} {{the ball}} continuously <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> is a requirement for a player to take steps with the ball. To dribble, a player pushes the ball down towards {{the ground with the}} fingertips rather than patting it; this ensures greater control.|$|E
25|$|Stoning {{by these}} baboons is done from the rocky {{walls of the}} canyon where they sleep and retreat when they are threatened. Stones are lifted <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> dropped over the side. The stones tumble {{down the side of}} the cliff or fall {{directly}} to the canyon floor. The researchers recorded 23 such incidents involving the voluntary release of 124 stones.|$|E
60|$|So well I am, dear Mr. Westwood, and {{so happy}} after a year's {{trial of the}} stuff of marriage, happier than ever, perhaps, and the {{revolution}} is so complete {{that one has to}} learn to stand up straight and steadily (like a landsman in a sailing ship) before one can do any work <b>with</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> brain.|$|R
50|$|Hunt's {{grandparents}} lived a {{few miles}} from his family home and he would frequently visit his Grandfather who had suffered a stroke. The stroke left his grandfather with the use of only one arm and during visits he often emphasized the importance of appreciating the ability to do things <b>with</b> <b>ones</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> to try make the most of your hands to create things that solve problems.|$|R
5000|$|He {{proposed}} a curriculum {{framework within which}} each state or school district could pluralistically vary constituent areas of study. The curriculum of the Paidea Proposal was divided into five broad categories, with the first three being conventionally intellectual. The fourth involved manual skills (not for a vocational purpose, but to acquire the mental agility of learning <b>with</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hands),</b> <b>and</b> the fifth category introduced students {{to the world of}} work: ...|$|R
25|$|Beach Volleyball {{takes place}} at Waveside. Players serve by making an upward {{throwing}} motion <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> then a swinging motion with the other. The ball is passed or returned using bump, set and spike motions. Single player, local multiplayer and online multiplayer game modes are available. Beach Volleyball mini games include Bump Bash, in which the player must avoid as many thrown objects as possible, and Body Ball, where the player is required to return the ball using a specific body part.|$|E
25|$|Giorgio Vasari {{describes}} Aspertini {{as having}} an eccentric personality: half-insane but ambidextrous, he worked so rapidly with both hands {{that he was able}} to divide chiaroscuro between them, painting chiaro <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> scuro with the other. Vasari also quotes Aspertini as complaining that all his Bolognese colleagues were copying Raphael. Aspertini also painted façade decorations (all now lost), and altarpieces, many of which are often eccentric and charged in expression. For example, his Bolognese Pietà appears to occur in an other-worldly electric sky.|$|E
25|$|After {{being hired}} at a farm, the pair are confronted by Curley—The Boss's small, {{aggressive}} son with a Napoleon complex who dislikes larger men, {{and starts to}} target Lennie. Curley's flirtatious and provocative wife, to whom Lennie is instantly attracted, poses a problem as well. In contrast, the pair also meets Candy, an elderly ranch handyman <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> a loyal dog, and Slim, an intelligent and gentle jerkline-skinner whose dog has recently had a litter of puppies. Slim gives a puppy to Lennie and Candy, whose loyal, accomplished sheep dog was put down by fellow ranch-hand Carlson.|$|E

50|$|Aid {{climbing}} {{is sometimes}} errantly {{referred to as}} class 6 climbing, since its reliance on ascent by one's equipment rather than merely being protected by it is regarded by purists as falling outside the traditional Classes 1-5 Yosemite Decimal System rankings that rely on making progress <b>with</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet {{in direct contact with}} the rock alone. Aid climbing has its own ranking system, using a separate scale from A0 through A5.|$|R

25|$|Bench {{planes are}} {{characterized}} by the cutting iron bedded with the bevel facing down and attached to a chipbreaker. Most metal bench planes, and some larger wooden ones, are designed with a rear handle known as a tote. Block planes {{are characterized by}} the absence of a chipbreaker and the cutting iron bedded with the bevel up. The block plane is usually a smaller tool that can be held <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> is used for general purpose work such as taking down a knot in the wood, smoothing small pieces, chamfering edges, and making the end of a sawed board square and smooth.|$|E
25|$|A {{well-documented}} {{example of}} social transmission of a behaviour {{occurred in a}} group of macaques on Hachijojima Island, Japan. The macaques lived in the inland forest until the 1960s, when a group of researchers started giving them potatoes on the beach: soon, they started venturing onto the beach, picking the potatoes from the sand, and cleaning and eating them. About one year later, an individual was observed bringing a potato to the sea, putting it into the water <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> cleaning it with the other. This behaviour was soon expressed by the individuals living in contact with her; when they gave birth, this behaviour was also expressed by their young - a form of social transmission.|$|E
25|$|The left {{panel has}} St Anthony Abbot (a saint {{commonly}} associated with sickness and healing in the Middle Ages) with his emblematic pig and St James standing behind two male donors, identified as Anthony Seghers, master of the hospital, and Brother James Ceuninc. Seghers joined the hospital as a brother in 1445 and by 1461 had risen to hospital master, a position he held intermittently {{until his death in}} 1475. He faces the center of the panel, flanked by his patron saint, Anthony, who leans on a tau staff <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> holds a bible in the other. Ceunic, a hospital brother from 1469 and bursar between 1488 and 1490, kneels to the left behind Seghers. His patron saint, James (identifiable by his attributes of pilgrim's staff and hat), stands behind him.|$|E

60|$|L. I don't {{know what}} you call 'much.' It {{is a long time}} since I met with {{anything}} in which there was little. There's not much in this, perhaps. The crystal must be either dirty or clean,--and there's an end. So it is <b>with</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>one's</b> heart--only you can wash your hands without changing them, but not hearts, nor crystals. On the whole, while you are young, it will be as well to take care that your hearts don't want much washing; for they may perhaps need wringing also, when they do.|$|R
25|$|If {{there be}} an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of {{independency}} <b>with</b> the <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> <b>with</b> the other brandishing a whip over his affrighted slaves.|$|R
25|$|Arriving at Suriname, Candide meets Martin, a local pessimist. He {{shows him}} a slave <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> one foot lost while {{harvesting}} sugar-cane, {{which is the}} result of Europeans eating sugar; Candide is unable to convince Martin otherwise ("Words, Words, Words"). Vanderdendur, a Dutch villain, offers his ship, the Santa Rosalia, in exchange for the golden sheep. Candide is excited when he is told that the Santa Rosalia is to depart for Venice. The locals and Vandendur wish Candide a safe journey to Venice ("Bon Voyage"). However, the ship sinks and Martin drowns as a result. After reuniting with his golden sheep, Candide is picked up by a galley, meeting five deposed kings. The galley is rowed by slaves, including Pangloss, revived once again. The kings say that they will live humbly, serving both god and men, and Pangloss leads their debate ("The Kings' Barcarolle").|$|E
25|$|Western riding is a {{style of}} horseback riding which evolved from the {{ranching}} and warfare traditions brought to the Americas by the Spanish Conquistadors, and both equipment and riding style evolved to meet the working needs of the cowboy in the American West. American cowboys needed to work long hours in the saddle over rough terrain, sometimes needing to rope cattle with a lariat (or lasso). Because of the necessity to control the horse <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> use a lariat with the other, western horses were trained to neck rein, that is, to change direction with light pressure of a rein against the horse's neck. Horses were also trained to exercise {{a certain degree of}} independence in using their natural instincts to follow the movements of a cow, thus a riding style developed that emphasized a deep, secure seat, and training methods encouraged a horse to be responsive on very light rein contact.|$|E
25|$|With much of Spain in open revolt, Napoleon {{established}} a headquarters at Bayonne on the Spanish frontier to reorganize his beleaguered forces and redress the situation. Having little {{respect for his}} Spanish opponents, the Emperor decided that a swift display of force would cow the insurgents and quickly consolidate his control of Spain. To this end, Napoleon dispatched a number of flying columns to throttle the rebellion by seizing and pacifying Spain's major cities: from Madrid, Marshal Bessières pushed northwest into Old Castile with 25,000 men and sent a detachment east into Aragón, aiming to capture Santander <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> Zaragoza with the other; General Moncey marched toward Valencia with 29,350 men; and General Duhesme marshalled 12,710 troops in Catalonia and put Gerona under siege. Finally, General Dupont, a distinguished field commander, was to lead 13,000 men south toward Seville and ultimately the port of Cádiz, which sheltered Admiral François Rosilly's fleet from the Royal Navy.|$|E

6000|$|L. I don't {{know what}} you call [...] "much." [...] It {{is a long time}} since I met with {{anything}} in which there was little. There's not much in this, perhaps. The crystal must be either dirty or clean,--and there's an end. So it is <b>with</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>one's</b> heart-- only you can wash your hands without changing them, but not hearts, nor crystals.

25|$|In {{the morning}} the three guides came back, {{traversing}} the face from a hole near the Eigerwand station and risking their lives under incessant avalanches. Toni Kurz was still alive but almost helpless, <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> one arm completely frozen. Kurz hauled himself off the cliff after cutting loose the rope that bound him to his dead teammate below and climbed back onto the face. The guides {{were not able to}} pass an unclimbable overhang that separated them from Kurz. They managed to give him a rope long enough to reach them by tying two ropes together. While descending, Kurz could not get the knot to pass through his carabiner. He tried for hours to reach his rescuers who were only a few metres below him. Then he began to lose consciousness. One of the guides, climbing on another's shoulders, was able to touch the tip of Kurz's crampons with his ice-axe but could not reach higher. Kurz was unable to descend further and, completely exhausted, died slowly.|$|E
25|$|The player {{may only}} wield two melee weapons and two {{secondary}} weapons at one time. Most melee weapons, called Trick Weapons, can transform into an alternate state; each state encourages {{a different approach}} to combat. For example, the Hunter Axe in its initial state is wielded <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> can be used to quickly dispatch enemies in cramped areas, but when transformed into its secondary state, it becomes an extended two handed weapon more suited for crowd control. With most Trick Weapons, one state is usually a slower, bigger weapon, that deals heavier damage per hit, while the other state is smaller, faster, and deals its damage in hit streaks. The player's main secondary weapon is a firearm; the firearm, usually a pistol, {{can be used in a}} traditional sense, as well as a way to stun enemies. When an enemy is stunned, the player can perform a Visceral attack; Visceral attacks cause a large amount of damage in one hit and can also be performed after the player strikes an enemy from behind with a charged attack. Other secondary weapons include a torch, cannon, and wooden shield, while other main melee weapons include a hammer, sword, two-handed gun, which serves as the melee and ranged weapon, and a whip. The player can carry other offensive weapons, such as molotovs, throwing knives, and pebbles.|$|E

500|$|The {{movement}} of pieces {{is to be}} done with one hand. Once the hand is taken off a piece after moving it, the move cannot be retracted unless the move is illegal.

500|$|Kate Swoger of The Montreal Gazette called Lucy a [...] "gorgeous mistake", {{describing}} her thus: [...] "an elderly woman dancing in a lush spring field, sagging breasts flopping willy-nilly, as she inexplicably seems {{to hold a}} red chair to her behind <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> a clutch of daisies in the other". Author Cash Peters, using less florid language, summarized it as [...] "the old woman with an armchair glued to her ass".|$|E

50|$|Holes {{could be}} ground out of stones {{with the use}} of sharp pointed stones or {{hardened}} sticks. By spinning the ground stone <b>with</b> <b>one's</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> applying substantial pressure to the sharp point into the ground stone, a hole could be drilled into the stone with a large amount of time and effort. Sand would be used to help quicken the process by putting it in the partially formed hole as the sharp point was being pressed. The sand would help grind more of the stone away. To put a hole all the way through a piece of stone, it would be first drilled half way in one direction and be finished on the opposite side.|$|R
