After she had appeared in four pornographic films in the softcore and fetish genrestrample fetish specificallypublic discussion about the Year 2000 problem {{and the end of the}} world caused her to think that she might experience divine judgment for her lifestyle. She then became a Christian, married her boyfriend Jon, started and completed a course in cosmetology, left the sex industry, and became a hairdresser all by September 1999. In 2003, Veitch discovered that a friend of hers who was working as a stripper had died as a result of alcoholism. Veitch began to evangelize to strippers because she <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> had told her friend about the gospel before she died.|$|E
5|$|After her husband's death, Mary Shelley {{lived for}} a year with Leigh Hunt and his family in Genoa, where she often saw Byron and {{transcribed}} his poems. She resolved to live by her pen and for her son, but her financial situation was precarious. On 23 July 1823, she left Genoa for England and stayed with her father and stepmother in the Strand until a small advance from her father-in-law enabled her to lodge nearby. Sir Timothy Shelley had at first agreed to support his grandson, Percy Florence, only if he were handed over to an appointed guardian. Mary Shelley rejected this idea instantly. She managed instead to wring out of Sir Timothy a limited annual allowance (which she had to repay when Percy Florence inherited the estate), but {{to the end of}} his days he refused to meet her in person and dealt with her only through lawyers. Mary Shelley busied herself with editing her husband's poems, among other literary endeavours, but concern for her son restricted her options. Sir Timothy threatened to stop the allowance if any biography of the poet were published. In 1826, Percy Florence became the legal heir of the Shelley estate after the death of his half-brother Charles Shelley, his father's son by Harriet Shelley. Sir Timothy raised Mary's allowance from £100 a year to £250 but remained as difficult as ever. Mary Shelley enjoyed the stimulating society of William Godwin's circle, but poverty prevented her from socialising as she <b>wished.</b> <b>She</b> also felt ostracised by those who, like Sir Timothy, still disapproved of her relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley.|$|E

25|$|One of the show's most {{maligned}} storylines of all-time involved show matriarch Rachel Cory Hutchins being {{kidnapped and}} then impersonated by an evil doppelgänger countess, Justine Duvalier (also played by Victoria Wyndham). It was panned by the soap press as being {{worthy of a}} Mystery Science Theater 3000 level of ridicule. During the storyline, the show was dealt another major blow when fan favorite Paul Michael Valley was fired and his character, Ryan, was killed off. Fans were relieved when Justine's reign of terror was put to an end when Carl finished her off with a letter opener. Wyndham was quoted as liking the storyline at first, but after it played out, she stated that she <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> had never appeared in it.|$|E

She spent her first day on a sunny beach lamenting to a stranger that she <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> had the time to meet Mr. Right, get married and have kids. Unbeknownst to her, the stranger was a man from her past who was in love with her when they met years ago. He proposed to her the next day and she married him, but when the prank was revealed, her new husband felt cheated and unleashed his wrath on her.|$|E
25|$|Sada Abe {{was born}} in 1905. Her mother doted on Sada, who was her {{youngest}} surviving child, and allowed her to do as she <b>wished.</b> <b>She</b> encouraged Abe to take lessons in singing and in playing the shamisen, both activities which, at the time, were more closely associated with geishas and prostitutes than with classical artistic endeavor. Geishas were considered glamorous celebrities at the time, and Abe herself pursued this image by skipping school for her musical lessons, and wearing stylish make-up. As family problems over her siblings, sister Teruko and brother Shintaro, became more pressing, Abe was often sent {{out of the house}} alone. She soon fell in with a group of similarly independent teenagers. At the age of 14, during one of her outings with this group, she was raped by one of her acquaintances. Her parents initially defended and supported her, but she became a difficult teenager. As she became more irresponsible and uncontrollable, her parents sold her to a geisha house in Yokohama in 1922, hoping to find her a place in society with some direction. Toku Abe, Sada's oldest sister, testified that Sada wished to become a geisha. Sada herself, however, claimed that her father made her a geisha as punishment for her promiscuity.|$|E

Mary Priestley died on September 17, 1796; {{she was already}} ill and never fully recovered after the shock of her son's death. On September 19 of that year Joseph wrote: [...] "This day I bury my wife....she had taken much thought in planning the new house and {{now that it is}} far advanced and promises to be everything she <b>wished,</b> <b>she</b> is removed to another." [...] After dinner on Monday 14 April 1800, various members of Priestley's household fell ill, with symptoms of food poisoning, which prompted the Reading Advertiser to falsely accuse Priestley's son William, of trying to poison them with arsenic.|$|E

500|$|Based on six reviews,Truth Serum {{received}} an average score of 3.2/5.0 on website Kritiker, which assigns a normalised rating out of 5.0 to reviews from mainstream critics across Sweden. Camila Astorga Díaz of the Swedish edition of Gaffa wrote that Truth Serum [...] "fulfils {{its role as}} background music while traveling", but considered that it lacks [...] "that one thing that {{makes you want to}} play repeat". Peter Carlsson of Allehanda called it a strong debut but stated that it did not help Lo to stand out from other pop artists. Svenska Dagbladets Sara-Märta Höglund compared the EP to Katy Perry's Prism (2013) and stated that, [...] "though Lo knows how to make a hit, I have <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> had ventured out on a more stripped-down production and dropped the tiresome drug romanticism".|$|E

Following White's death in 1813, Beswick's body was bequeathed to a DrOllier, on whose death in 1828 it was donated to the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society, where she became known as the Manchester Mummy, or the Mummy of Birchin Bower. She was displayed in the museum's entrance hall, next to a Peruvian and an Egyptian mummy, and her relatives were allowed free access to visit her as they <b>wished.</b> <b>She</b> was described by a visitor in 1844 as [...] "one of the most remarkable objects in the museum".

Matt Brown, Veitch's pastor at Sandals Church, arrived for a haircut and Veitch asked him for help to start an organization to minister to sex workers. He was interested. Veitch and Brown started Matthew's House, an organization they founded as [...] "a ministry to help people working in or addicted to the sex industry".

[...] To a friend she wrote, [...] " [...] how open and bare and wide my own vulnerability would be ... the body wounds are deep."

500|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Robbins as [...] "confident", [...] "ambitious", and [...] "cheerful". Shortly {{after her}} {{arrival in the}} show, Robbins became a love-interest for Torres (Ramirez). The {{relationship between the two}} is referred to by fans by the portmanteau [...] "Calzona". Torres' previous girlfriend Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith) was written out of Grey's Anatomy in 2008, {{due to a lack of}} chemistry between the characters. Rhimes praised the chemistry between Robbins and Torres in contrast, comparing it to that between the show's primary couple Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Shepherd (Dempsey), and stating: [...] "They have that little thing that makes you want to watch them." [...] Rhimes named the addition of Capshaw to the cast as one of the elements of the season she was most proud of, commenting that she <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> could have found Callie a love interest that [...] "sparkled" [...] sooner, but was pleased with eventually having found one in Robbins.|$|E

Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe graded {{the production of the}} song as [...] "B", complimenting the lyrics in particular, by writing [...] "it’s always a good sign when there’s a line as memorable as that one, the kind that lingers around in your head more than the song itself." [...] He also added that he [...] "appreciate(s) the restrained vocal, though a more varied melody would’ve made the chorus quite a bit more distinctive." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite having {{released}} two {{highly successful}} albums, Mariah Carey and Emotions (1991), the singer {{had yet to}} embark on world tour because of stage-fright and the possible negative effects of singing vocally strenuous songs every night. Many critics were unconvinced with her reasoning, and accused her of manipulating her vocals in the studio. In response, Carey appeared on MTV Unplugged to perform a small selection of her songs live in 1992. For her rendition of [...] "Someday", she altered the arrangement and stripped it back {{to give it a}} rawer sound. This version was produced by Carey and Afanasieff and recorded live at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York City on March 16, 1992. In the liner notes of #1 to Infinity, Carey expressed her dislike toward the original studio version on Mariah Carey and stated that she <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> could [...] "delete some of the overproduction," [...] which is why she decided to include the MTV Unplugged version on the compilation instead. In addition to MTV Unplugged, the song was included on the set-list of Carey's Las Vegas residency show, Number 1 to Infinity (2015–17).|$|E
500|$|While {{promoting}} the album, Cole said [...] "R, rock and pop {{has always been}} my forte" [...] and called the music something she <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> had recorded [...] "at least five years ago". She revealed her dissatisfaction with being labeled a jazz singer and her desire to showcase her versatility as an artist, saying she aimed to [...] "put out some music that we hadn't heard {{in a long time}} from anybody, really". The project was Cole's first collaboration with R producer Dallas Austin. Rashod Ollison of The Virginian-Pilot wrote the album represented how [...] " [...] had hung up the gowns and returned to her soul roots"; in past performances, Cole would wear gowns when singing jazz. During the production of the album, Verve Records stipulated that it must include original material. One of the two new songs [...] "Five Minutes Away" [...] was based on Cole's experiences with Austin and keyboard player Chanz Parkman. Prior to the album's release, CBS News Caitlin Johnson wrote that it was [...] "a sharp turn for a woman perhaps best known for singing jazz standards." [...] She connected the project to Cole's decision to reinvent herself, saying that its title represented [...] "leaving the past behind".|$|E
500|$|The musical {{performances}} in this episode were mostly praised by critics, {{though there was}} little said {{about the quality of}} the abbreviated performance by the Hipsters in competition.

Jen Harper of BuddyTV echoed Kurt's words in the episode; she said [...] "Rachel really is as talented as she is irritating", but <b>wished</b> <b>she</b> [...] "didn't always look like she's crying while she's singing", and added that she was [...] "really digging Kurt in a lower register". Futterman noted that Rachel, as is usual with her [...] "power ballads", [...] "uses the time to grapple with the latest obstacle to her future stardom, while we see Kurt deliver a clear, restrained take. Benigno called Michele's voice [...] "astounding", and added that her solo alternated [...] "with Kurt's audition with the Warblers, which is predictably outstanding", and gave the song a [...] "B+". Even those who disliked the song or the composer were won over by the performance: Berk gave it three stars out of five, and Burns thought it was [...] "fantastic"; both liked the song's tag-team presentation.|$|E
