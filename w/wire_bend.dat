Eigenfrequency of the domain wall free oscillations at the pinning potential and the effective friction are determined as functions of the curvature and domain wall width. The pinning potential originates from the effective curvature induced Dzyaloshinsky-like term in the exchange energy.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{integration}} of computation and digital technology to support design in the Trinidad Carnival. I argue that computation can contribute to design in the Trinidad Carnival by (1) addressing the dying art of <b>wire</b> <b>bending,</b> (2) improving design, and (3) by fostering a more inclusive design process. My study is motivated by the current design problems in the Trinidad Carnival. They include the dying art form of <b>wire</b> <b>bending,</b> the lack of time and resources to generate design alternatives, {{the lack of an}} inclusive design process, and the lack of community involvement in "making" in Carnival. To address these problems, I develop support based on a comprehensive study of the existing situation, and explore {{the integration of}} computational tools and digital technology in the design process. To that end, I (1) develop the Bailey-Derek <b>wire</b> <b>bending</b> grammar to capture the unique, traditional art form of <b>wire</b> <b>bending,</b> (2) propose a new, more inclusive design process, (3) use computation and digital technology to enable the generation of design alternatives and create "objects to think with" in the design process, and (4) add to the understanding of a design process outside the domains of product, industrial, architecture, and engineering design. These explorations are significant because: 1. The <b>wire</b> <b>bending</b> shape grammar can be used as an educational tool to address the current absence of a system to pass on this dying art form; 2. A digital tool can be developed from the encoding of the visual design features in <b>wire</b> <b>bending</b> further supporting this art form; and 3. The integration of computation and digital technology in the design process can improve design by creating a more inclusive design process, allow the generation of design alternatives, and creating "objects to think with" in design. The Carnival of Trinidad has spawned more than 70 carnivals around the globe. It is the most copied, but yet most understudied carnival in the world.

30|$|In our study, {{we found}} that <b>wire</b> <b>bending</b> played an {{essential}} role on the mechanical properties of SS wires. It lowered Young’s modulus, and this influence was enhanced by the increase of pH. A higher flexural Young’s modulus indicates a stiffer wire with a greater resistance to deformation. <b>Wire</b> <b>bending</b> was originally introduced to elongate {{the length of a}} wire and thus to increase the flexibility and to lower Young’s modulus in order to deliver a moderate and persistent optimal force for tooth movement.

30|$|Determining {{the surface}} {{roughness}} {{of stainless steel}} wires is a fundamental concern in corrosion resistance of a wire for orthodontic clinic.

Even though the preformed SS archwires are popularly used nowadays, the chairside <b>wire</b> <b>bending</b> is inevitable due to the variations in the malocclusions of individual patient. In this research it is determined that bent SS wires have a highly significantly rougher surface than straight SS wires, ignoring pH. These divergences in surface roughness between bent and straight wires could be caused by the use of pliers when <b>bending</b> the <b>wires,</b> which could easily cause damages to the protective oxide layer.|$|R

At this dedicated reset appointment, both clinical and radiographic examination were performed to assess the position of the crown and roots, and one reason to reposition a bracket would be to address a root parallelism problem. However, an accurate radiographic technique controlling beam angulation or using volumetric imaging is required to assess root parallelism.|$|R
