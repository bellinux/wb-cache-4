40|$|Aims To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} unilateral PIC and specific dentofacial parameters. Materials and methods A sample of 216 subjects, with 108 subjects in the retrospective and prospective samples respectively. Dental parameters: The following dental parameters were assessed: Inter-canine and intermolar width; palatal depth and palatal area; anterior Bolton tooth-size discrepancy (TSD); maxillary arch shape and ratio and maxillary central and lateral incisor shape and ratio. Facial parameters: Three-dimensional (3 D) images were taken for subjects in the prospective sample only, and {{were used to assess}} the following facial parameters: Face shape; face ratio and 3 D distances and angles. Results Dental parameters: Inter-canine width <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> smaller in the test group compared to the control group in the retrospective (p= 0. 0002) and prospective (p= 0. 0018) samples respectively. Anterior Bolton TSD <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> higher in the prospective test group compared to controls (p= 0. 0070). Arch ratio <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> smaller in the test group than the control group for the retrospective sample (p= 0. 0029), whereas no significant difference was recorded in the prospective sample (p= 0. 1017). Arch shape distribution <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> different in the retrospective sample (p= 0. 009). Tooth shape distribution <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> different for the maxillary right central incisor in the retrospective sample (p= 0. 030).

No significant difference was found in all other 3 D distances and angles measured. Conclusion Inter-canine width <b>was</b> <b>significantly</b> smaller in unilateral PIC subjects compared to controls.
