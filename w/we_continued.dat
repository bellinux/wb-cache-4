25|$|Thus {{the young}} Chinaman's proud dream {{of one day}} riding through the gates of Peking and beholding the palace (yamen) of his fabulously mighty emperor, {{as well as of}} perhaps securing, through my recommendation, a lucrative post, and finally, though by no means last in his estimation, of exchanging the Turki wife he had left behind in Khotan for a Chinese bride—this proud dream was pricked at the foot of Arka-tagh. Sadly and silently he stood alone in the desert, gazing after us, as <b>we</b> <b>continued</b> our way towards the far-distant goal of his {{youthful}} ambition.|$|E
500|$|Several {{film and}} {{entertainment}} critics have noted similarities and {{parallels between the}} stories of The Lion King and William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet, and their protagonists. [...] Allers said that these similarities were not initially intentional and {{came as a surprise}} to the filmmakers themselves; they noticed the similarities only after the story was established and they eventually decided to pursue it. [...] According to Hahn, [...] "When we first pitched the revised outline of the movie ... someone in the room announced that its themes and relationships were similar to Hamlet. [...] Everyone responded favorably to the idea that we were doing something Shakespearean, so <b>we</b> <b>continued</b> {{to look for ways to}} model our film on that all-time classic." ...|$|E
500|$|At that time, a Parisian ballet {{audience}} typically {{consisted of}} two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a [...] "Bohemian" [...] group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would [...] "acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes". Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions [...] began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: [...] "Everything available was tossed in our direction, but <b>we</b> <b>continued</b> to play on". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with {{the intervention of the}} police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. Things grew noticeably quieter during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final [...] "Sacrificial Dance" [...] was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.|$|E

She was coaxed to lie down again, but {{remained}} agitated. [...] "The child turned to me, and said anxiously, 'Send a telegram to mama.'" [...] Eagar promised it would be done. [...] "She added, 'immediately.' ... <b>We</b> <b>continued</b> to fan the feeble spark of life, but moment by moment it declined. She began to talk to her cousins, and seemed to imagine she was playing with them. She asked for little Anastasie and I brought the wee thing into the room. The dying eyes rested on her for a moment, and Anastasie said, 'Poor cousin Ella! Poor Princess Elizabeth!' I took the baby out of the room." [...] Doctors told Alexandra that the child's mother should be notified, but the telegram did not arrive until the following morning, when Elisabeth had already died. An autopsy following her death confirmed that she had died of virulent typhoid, although it was rumored she had eaten from a poisoned dish intended for the Tsar.|$|E
500|$|As the Union cavalry approached, {{about half}} of the 120 local civilians fled south toward the {{railroad}} depot, and took positions closer to the men from the Confederate army. The initial volley fired by the remaining (and nervous) locals was ineffective because it had been fired too soon. The second volley, fired after a signal by Major Kent, found many in Captain Delaney's Company A. His group was fired upon by a company of Confederate soldiers in the street and from locals in the houses. One local, recalling this volley many years later, said [...] "The colonel commanding the raiding party was killed, {{and the head of the}} column went down, men and horses in a confused mass." [...] He also said [...] "The momentum of the column of cavalry carried many who were near the front over the dead and wounded men and horses. It was death to them to remain or hesitate. They spurred their horses forward over their dead and dying comrades and passed between our ranks as we opened out to the sidewalks. While they dashed by us firing their pistols, <b>we</b> <b>continued</b> the use of the musket. The bugle sounded the retreat, and the column of cavalrymen faced about and retired, only to re-form and come at us again." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{system has}} also been {{upgraded}} to use high-definition technology. However, the systems at Texas Stadium (Dallas Cowboys), RCA Dome (Indianapolis Colts), and Giants Stadium (New York Giants and Jets) did not receive the HDTV updates since those stadiums were scheduled to be (and since have been) replaced in the forthcoming years. One reason that the technology was improved was that fans with high-definition televisions at home were having better views on replays than the officials and according to Dean Blandino, the NFL's instant replay director [...] "that could have bit us in the rear if <b>we</b> <b>continued</b> [...]" [...] In addition, {{the amount of time}} allotted for the referee to review a play was reduced from 90seconds to one minute.|$|E

I kept reaching up for his hand, but he hadn't looked down and seemed unaware.

When he took my hand in his, it felt large and cool. For a few moments, <b>we</b> <b>continued</b> walking in silence. [...] "Can I call you Uncle Billy?" [...] I asked.

2500|$|DeLonge would reunite with Blink-182 {{near the}} end of 2008. Barker had been {{involved}} in a fatal private plane crash, which laid grounds for the band's reformation. DeLonge found out via the TV news at an airport while waiting to board a flight; within minutes, he was crying in his seat. [...] "I {{thought he was going to}} die," [...] says DeLonge, who quickly reached out to his former bandmate, mailing him a letter and photograph. [...] "Instantly after the plane crash, I was like, 'Hey, I want to play music with him again.'" [...] DeLonge was the first to approach the subject of reuniting, and Blink-182 announced their reunion, a new album, and a reunion tour in February 2009 at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards. Blink-182 embarked on a reunion tour of North America from July to October 2009, supported by Weezer and Fall Out Boy. The tour was wildly successful, selling out amphitheaters nationwide: [...] "I was completely blown away and dumbfounded by how big that reunion tour was. [...] We were very fortunate, very blessed," [...] DeLonge later said. [...] "And truthfully, that's why <b>we</b> <b>continued,</b> because we were so blown away. We were like, [...] "Wow, we got to suck this up and start acting like adults because this is beautiful.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Amongst the Cuman-Kipchaks ethnic names often became {{personal}} names– {{this was}} also practiced amongst the Mongols. This practice involved naming newborns after the names of conquered tribes and people. Names such as 'Baskord' (from the Bashkirs), 'Imek' (from the Kimeks), 'Kitan' (from the Mongol Khitan people), and 'Urus' were used by the Cumans. Friar William of Rubruk, a Franciscan traveler who visited the Mongols in 1253-55, provides another account of Cuman customs. He mentions that Cumans built statues for dead notables, facing east and holding a cup (these statues {{are not to be}} confused with the balbals, which represent the enemies that were killed by him). He also notes that for richer notables, the Cumans built tombs in the form of houses. Rubruk gives an eyewitness account about a man who had recently died: the Cumans had hung up sixteen horses' hides, in groups of four, between high poles, facing the four points of the compass. The mourners then also placed kumis (a fermented mares' milk drink widely drunk in Inner Asia) for the dead man to consume. Other graves had plenty of stones statues placed around them (balbals), with four tall ones placed to face the points of the compass. Rubrick also wrote [...] "Here the Cumans, who are called Chapchat [...] used to pasture their flocks, but the Germans call them Valans and their province Valania, and Isidorus calls (the region stretching) from the river Don as far as the Azov Sea and the Danube, Alania. And this land stretches from the Danube as far as the Don, the borderline of Asia and Europe; one can reach there in two months with quick riding as the Tatars ride.... and this country which extends from the Danube to the Tanais [...] was all inhabited by the Chapcat Comans, and even further from the Don to the Volga, which rivers are at a distance of ten days' journey...And in the territory between these two rivers [...] where <b>we</b> <b>continued</b> our way, the Cuman Kipchaks lived." ...|$|E
