5|$|Like the {{national}} language, {{the people of}} Sandakan mainly speak Malay, with a distinct Sabahan creole. The Malay language in Sandakan {{are different from the}} Malay language in the west coast which resembles Brunei Malay. In Sandakan, this language has been influenced by many <b>words</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Suluk language. As Sandakan had also been dominated by the Hakka and Cantonese Chinese, Hakka and Cantonese widely spoken, while today Mandarin dominates as the lingua franca among both dialect subgroups. While for the east coast Bajau, their language has similarities with the Sama language in the Philippines and also borrowed many <b>words</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Suluk language which is different from the west coast Bajau who had been influenced by the Malayic languages of Brunei Malay.|$|E
5|$|Although some eyewitnesses {{expressed}} {{the view that}} Joseph Locke, driving Rocket, was at fault, following a few <b>words</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> coroner the jury returned a verdict of accidental death. The directors and engineers of the L were explicitly absolved of all blame, and no deodand was to {{be attached to the}} locomotive or the railway.|$|E
5|$|Punic was {{spoken at}} the highest level of society: the emperor Septimius Severus (reigned 193–211) was born in Leptis Magna and spoke Punic as well as Latin and Greek, while his sister {{supposedly}} had little command of Latin at all. Augustine, who was from North Africa, several times mentions Punic; he observed that it was related to Hebrew and Syriac, and his knowledge of Punic helped him figure out transliterated Semitic <b>words</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bible.|$|E

5|$|The {{people of}} Tawau mainly speak Malay, with a {{distinct}} Sabahan creole. The Malay language here {{are different from the}} Malay language in the west coast which resembles Brunei Malay. In Tawau, the language had been influenced by the Indonesian language spoken by the Buginese, Florenese and Timorese. As most Tawau Chinese are Hakka Chinese, Hakka Chinese is widely spoken. The east coast Bajau's language has similarities with the Sama language in the Philippines and has borrowed <b>words</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Suluk language.

5|$|They speak a dialect of Sri Lankan Tamil {{that is used}} in the region. During {{religious}} festivals, {{people who}} enter a trance or spirit possession sometimes use a mixed language that contains <b>words</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Vedda language. Most Vedar are Hindu Saivites and worship a plethora of folk deities, as well as the main Hindu deities such as Murugan, Pillaiyar and Amman. They also maintain the ancestor worship tradition of the interior Veddas. Clan divisions, if they still exist, do not {{play an important role in}} choosing of marriage partners or place of domicile. Most identify themselves as a caste among the Tamils as opposed to a separate ethnic group. Their economic conditions have been impacted by the Sri Lankan civil war.|$|E
5|$|Taylor and his Secretary of State, John M. Clayton, both lacked {{diplomatic}} experience, {{and came}} into office at a relatively uneventful time in American–international politics. Their shared nationalism allowed Taylor to devolve foreign policy matters to Clayton with minimal oversight, although no decisive foreign policy was established under their administration. As opponents of the autocratic European order, they vocally supported German and Hungarian liberals in the revolutions of 1848, although they offered {{little in the way}} of aid. A perceived insult from the French minister Guillaume Tell Poussin nearly led to a break in diplomatic relations until Poussin was replaced, and a reparation dispute with Portugal resulted in harsh <b>words</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Taylor administration. In a more positive effort, the administration arranged for two ships to assist in the United Kingdom's search for a team of British explorers, led by John Franklin, who had gotten lost in the Arctic. While previous Whig administrations had emphasized Pacific trade as an economic imperative, the Taylor administration took no major initiative in the Far East.|$|E
