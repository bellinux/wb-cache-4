5|$|In {{economic}} and environmental fields, the term decoupling is becoming increasingly used {{in the context of}} economic production and environmental quality. When used in this way, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure. Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism, the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to environmental quality. An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled. Exactly how, if, or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate. In 2011 the International Resource Panel, hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year—three times its current rate of consumption—unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling. The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum (ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries). By comparison, the average person in India today consumes four tons per year. Sustainability studies analyse ways to reduce resource intensity (the amount of resource (e.g. <b>water,</b> <b>energy,</b> or materials) needed for the production, consumption and disposal of a unit of good or service) whether this be achieved from improved economic management, product design, or new technology.|$|E

The approach considers variations in behavioral and technological <b>water</b> and <b>energy</b> use {{factors that affect}} U.

The study uses a recent, large, national, disaggregated household water use data set collected from 11 cities, as well as national <b>energy</b> data on <b>water</b> heater efficiency and setpoint/intake temperatures. First, probability distributions of <b>water</b> and <b>energy</b> use factors are identified and correlated.

Water supply accounts for 4 % of U.

Further, city-wide <b>water</b> and <b>energy</b> use and conservation estimates assume deterministic (homogenous) household characteristics and often do not include uncertainties in <b>water</b> and <b>energy</b> system parameters. Here, we present a stochastic simulation-optimization model that considers uncertainties and variability in household <b>water</b> and <b>energy</b> use and conservation. The model also embeds the city’s energy consumption to extract, convey, treat and distribute water to households, and treat wastewater. At the household scale, <b>water</b> and <b>energy</b> use are modeled stochastically using Monte Carlo simulation by considering the likelihood of each value <b>water</b> and <b>energy</b> parameter can take (i. e., probability distributions of use frequency and duration, use volume or flowrate, household size, hot water use percentage, water heater efficiency, etc.) for major household toilet, shower, faucet, clothes-washers, dishwasher, and outdoor water uses. We develop probability distributions for model parameters from a recent, large, national, disaggregated water use dataset comprising 1. 4 million water use events over 7, 900 days by 400 single family households in 11 U.

We embed the household water use simulation model in a city scale optimization model that selects the cost minimizing mix of conservation actions that achieve specified city-wide <b>water</b> and <b>energy</b> conservation targets within certain budgets. The optimization includes the energy required to extract, convey, treat, and distribute water to households and treat wastewater. The model helps cities size and target city-wide water conservation actions to meet <b>water</b> and <b>energy</b> reduction targets.

The approach is tested onto a dataset of smart metered <b>water</b> and <b>energy</b> consumption data from over 1000 households in South California.

As the majority of SADC’s population lives in poverty, regional development and integration are underpinned by <b>water</b> and <b>energy</b> security as the watercourses {{in the region are}} transboundary in nature. This paper reviews the region’s <b>water</b> and <b>energy</b> resources and recommends policies based on the water–energy nexus approach. This is achieved by reviewing literature on <b>water</b> and <b>energy</b> resources as well as policy issues. Water resources governance provides a strong case to create a water–energy nexus platform to support regional planning and integration as SADC countries share similar climatic and hydrological conditions. However, there has been a gap between <b>water</b> and <b>energy</b> sector planning in terms of policy alignment and technical convergence. These challenges hinder national policies on delivering economic and social development goals, as well as constraining the regional goal of greater integration. Regional objectives on sustainable energy and access to clean water for all can only be achieved through the recognition of the water–energy nexus, championed in an integrated and sustainable manner. A coordinated regional water–energy nexus approach stimulates economic growth, alleviates poverty and reduces high unemployment rates.

System dynamics is based on systems thinking, which focuses on the system structure and offers a deeper insight into problems.

The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate water/energy consumption and to propose alternatives that reduce <b>water</b> and <b>energy</b> in the processing of three food products; 1) edible bean, 2) dairy products, and 3) corn masa. Three main approaches were; 1) plant-scale audit data collection to determine energy consumption, 2) laboratory scale experiments to assess product quality changes with a reduction in <b>water</b> and <b>energy</b> usage, and 3) computer-aided simulation to design systems for reduced <b>water</b> and <b>energy</b> consumption and wastewater generation.

In dairy plant, the optimal heat recovery option could economically decrease the boiler fuel requirement by 50 times, and reduce the operating cost to 2. 7 % of the present cost. The water reuse process in redesigned corn masa process could reduce 90 % of wastewater and 55 % of water usage compared to the traditional process.
