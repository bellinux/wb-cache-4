25|$|Vergara's plan {{avoided the}} bloody frontal attack, nullified all defense works, cut any Peruvian <b>withdrawal</b> <b>line</b> {{to the east}} into the {{formidable}} Andes and would have a demoralizing effect on the Peruvians. However, there were no steady roads for movement of Chilean artillery and baggage, no water, no support from the navy was possible and many bottlenecks – where a small force might stop the whole Chilean army either {{on the way to}} Lima, or if it had to withdraw – were a feature of this line of approach. In addition, Vergara's plan required a well trained and disciplined army. Baquedano pushed and eventually succeeded in having his plan adopted.|$|E
2500|$|The Chilean General Staff had two {{alternative}} {{plans for}} their attack. Baquedano, the army chief, advocated {{a direct and}} frontal advance through the [...] "Tablada de Lurín", a known area with large areas of relatively plain terrain, against the line of Chorrillos. The advantages of this axis of advance were the shorter distances {{that had to be}} covered, a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>line,</b> sea side support from the Chilean navy, water supply (from Lurín), less requirement to train the troops and, as important, less need for complex Chilean discipline to control any advance and subsequent attack. The alternative plan of War Minister José Francisco Vergara laid down a turning movement, bypassing the Peruvian line by attacking from further to the east: through the Lurín valley, moving via Chantay and reaching Lima at Ate. Utilising this approach meant that Lima could be seized without resistance or both defense lines could be attacked from the rear.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{pump control}} system using a {{microcomputer}} for cardiopulmonary bypass has been developed. The parameters {{monitored by the}} computer are central venous pressure, aortic pressure, blood volume in a reservoir, and collapsing of a small vinyl bag in a venous withdrawal tube. Both pumps in the arterial infusion and the venous <b>withdrawal</b> <b>lines</b> are automatically controlled through an interface unit throughout cardiopulmonary bypass. The system regulates central venous pressure with a proportional-integral control algorithm to maintain intravascular volume constant. A screening algorithm is devised to remove artifacts introduced to the pressure measurement. During the weaning period, a perfusionist can select either the central venous pressure control or a reservoir blood volume control. Computerized pump perfusion was applied on 15 children during cardiac operations. Perfusion flow and central venous pressure were controlled satisfactorily with stable operation. Compared with conventional manually controlled pump perfusion, no significant difference was noted in mean aortic pressure, central venous pressure, net fluid balance, total urination, blood chemistry, and urinalysis. This system is useful {{and is expected to}} improve the safety of pump perfusion. (J THORAC CARDIOVASC SURG 1995; 109 : 428 - 38...|$|R

40|$|Cyclical {{changes in}} {{production}} of neuroactive steroids during the oestrous cycle induce {{significant changes in}} GABAA receptor expression in female rats. In the periaqueductal grey (PAG) matter, upregulation of ÃŽÂ± 4 ÃŽÂ² 1 ÃŽÂ´ GABAA receptors occurs as progesterone levels fall during late dioestrus (LD) or during withdrawal from an exogenous progesterone dosing regime. The new receptors {{are likely to be}} extrasynaptically located on the GABAergic interneurone population and to mediate tonic currents. Electrophysiological studies showed that when ÃŽÂ± 4 ÃŽÂ² 1 ÃŽÂ´ GABAA receptor expression was increased, the excitability of the output neurones in the PAG increased, due to a decrease in the level of ongoing inhibitory tone from the GABAergic interneurones. The functional consequences in terms of nociceptive processing were investigated in conscious rats. Baseline tail flick latencies were similar in all rats.
