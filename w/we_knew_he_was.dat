6000|$|... "I can't help it, sir," [...] Harris said; [...] "we {{all felt}} we couldn't {{go to bed}} to-night without telling Norris that <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> innocent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A horrible place, truly," [...] {{said the}} Captain, [...] "and one {{that it would}} be hard to find a fellow in even if <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't <b>know.</b> How can <b>we</b> <b>know?</b> <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> infatuated, that <b>is</b> all. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> {{up there}} in Folkestone, and she is in Folkestone, {{and they may be}} meeting----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But the {{initials}} stand for Sigismund Palsdorf, and <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a German baron," [...] broke in Amy, forgetting prudence in eagerness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Clever--" [...] Matt broke out. [...] "That's the way reputations is made ... in the noos-papers. How'd <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> robbin' his pardner?" ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{would not}} have been safe for us to say he was mistaken, but <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> Nikolaus said, [...] "We ask pardon for the mistake, but we meant to say seven." ...|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, he vaulted {{with a light}} leap on {{his hands}} up {{the edge of the}} precipice. The next thing <b>we</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> standing, safe and sound, with the rope round his waist, a living soul, on the further brink beyond the chasm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't see as it's any {{different}} {{from what it was}} before. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> bound to drive me away, an' it wasn't likely he'd stop after what little he's done. Now, Carrots, there's jest this much about it: you wouldn't be in any fuss with him if it wasn't for me, an' you can square things up this very minute by sayin' you've shook me. Why not do it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jeff was on {{the first}} raft, and for all <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> now safe at Fort Henry. Our {{steersman}} was shot, and we were captured." ...|$|R
60|$|And then, {{there being}} {{sufficient}} pennies in the cap, the author starts away, and pretends that Angelina thought this and said that, and that Edwin did {{all sorts of}} wonderful things. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> making it all up as <b>he</b> goes along. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> making up just what he thinks will please us. He, on the other hand, has to make-believe that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> doing it because he cannot help it, he being an artist. But <b>we</b> <b>know</b> well enough that, were we to stop throwing the pennies into the cap, he would find out precious soon that he could.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe Sobber {{will ever}} return to Putnam Hall," [...] came from Tom. [...] "Especially {{when he finds}} out that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the nephew of such a swindler as Merrick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We do not know. As long as Lady Alison lived (his aunt) she let us {{hear about}} him, and <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{recovering}} from his wound. Then came her death, {{and then my}} father's, and all the rest, and we {{lost sight of the}} Beauchamps. We saw the name in the Gazette as killed at Lucknow, but not the right Christian name nor the same rank; but then, though the regiment is come home, we have heard nothing of him, and though she has never spoken of him to me, I am sure Ermine believes he is dead, and thinks of him as part of the sunshine of the old Beauchamp days--the sunshine whose reflection lasts one's life." ...|$|E
60|$|In October, Stephen Shaw {{came home}} from the west to visit his father and mother after an absence of fifteen years. Jerry and I met him at a party at his brother-in-law's. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a {{bachelor}} of forty-five or so and had made heaps of money in the lumber business, so we expected to find him short and round and bald, with bulgy blue eyes and a double chin. On the contrary, he was a tall, handsome man with clear-cut features, laughing black eyes like a boy's, and iron-grey hair. That iron-grey hair nearly finished Jerry; she thinks there is nothing so distinguished and she had the escape of her life from falling in love with Stephen Shaw.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What of that?' Ernest answered, smiling. 'Didn't we meet Prince Strelinoffsky at Oriel last term, and didn't we {{talk with}} him too, {{as if he was}} an honest, hard-working, bread-earning Christian? and yet <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a member of the St. Petersburg office clique, and at the bottom of half the trouble in Poland for the last ten years or so. Grant even that Borodinsky is quite wrong in his way of dealing with noxious autocrats, and yet which {{do you think is the}} worst {{criminal}} of the two--he with his little honest glazier's shop in a back slum of Paddington, or Strelinoffsky with his jewelled fingers calmly signing accursed warrants to send childing Polish women to die of cold and hunger and ill-treatment on the way to Siberia?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is that so?" [...] said Mr. Crewe. <b>He</b> {{wanted to}} <b>be</b> of service, as <b>we</b> <b>know.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> {{a man of}} ideas, and the opening {{sentences}} of the speech were already occurring to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{knew that}} Paul was doin' well, you see, sir. <b>'E</b> <b>was</b> that splendidly dressed when Emily and young Smith seed 'im they was quite respectful like to 'im. So <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>'e</b> <b>was</b> all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{creature}} {{come from}} nobody knows where {{is not your}} cousin! How do <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> your cousin? <b>He</b> may <b>be</b> a valet who has taken his master's portmanteau, and run away in his postchaise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I think, sir,' {{observed}} Mr. Snitchey, gravely addressing {{himself to}} his partner, 'that of all the scrapes Mr. Warden's horses have brought him into at one time and another - {{and they have been}} pretty numerous, and pretty expensive, as none know better than himself, and you, and I - the worst scrape may turn out to be, if he talks in this way, this having ever been left by one of them at the Doctor's garden wall, with three broken ribs, a snapped collar- bone, and the Lord knows how many bruises. We didn't think so much of it, at the time when <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going on well under the Doctor's hands and roof; but it looks bad now, sir. Bad? It looks very bad. Doctor Jeddler too - our client, Mr. Craggs.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then he {{was gone}} from sight, and <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> hidden safely in the stump, where we could not follow him, for the weasel's body is slim and slender. But I have not lived in the forest all my life without {{learning}} something, and I whispered a plan to Judge Bullfinch that met with his approval. He sent messengers at once for the ivory-billed woodpeckers, and soon four of those big birds appeared and agreed to help us. They began tearing away at the stump with their strong beaks, and the splinters flew in every direction. It was not yet dark when the cunning weasel was dragged from his hole and was {{at the mercy of}} the birds he had so cruelly offended. We fell upon him in a flash, and he was dead almost instantly." ...|$|E
6000|$|The thirty-second day out of Bombay began inauspiciously. In {{the morning}} a sea smashed {{one of the}} galley doors. We dashed in through lots of steam and found the cook very wet and indignant with the ship:--"She's getting worse every day. She's trying to drown {{me in front of}} my own stove!" [...] He was very angry. We pacified him, and the carpenter, though washed away twice from there, managed to repair the door. Through that {{accident}} our dinner was not ready till late, but it didn't matter in the end because Knowles, who went to fetch it, got knocked down by a sea and the dinner went over the side. Captain Allistoun, looking more hard and thin-lipped than ever, hung on to full topsails and foresail, and would not notice that the ship, asked to do too much, appeared to lose heart altogether {{for the first time since}} we knew her. She refused to rise, and bored her way sullenly through the seas. Twice running, as though she had been blind or weary of life, she put her nose deliberately into a big wave and swept the decks from end to end. As the boatswain observed with marked annoyance, while we were splashing about in a body to try and save a worthless wash-tub:--"Every blooming thing in the ship is going overboard this afternoon." [...] Venerable Singleton broke his habitual silence and said with a glance aloft:--"The old man's in a temper with the weather, but it's no good bein' angry with the winds of heaven." [...] Jimmy had shut his door, of course. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dry and comfortable within his little cabin, and in our absurd way were pleased one moment, exasperated the next, by that certitude. Donkin skulked shamelessly, uneasy and miserable. He grumbled:--"I'm perishin' with cold outside in bloomin' wet rags, an' that 'ere black sojer sits dry on a blamed chest full of bloomin' clothes; blank his black soul!" [...] We took no notice of him; we hardly gave a thought to Jimmy and his bosom friend. There was no leisure for idle probing of hearts. Sails blew adrift. Things broke loose. Cold and wet, we were washed about the deck while trying to repair damages. The ship tossed about, shaken furiously, like a toy in the hand of a lunatic. Just at sunset there was a rush to shorten sail before the menace of a sombre hail cloud. The hard gust of wind came brutal like the blow of a fist. The ship relieved of her canvas in time received it pluckily: she yielded reluctantly to the violent onset; then coming up with a stately and irresistible motion, brought her spars to windward in the teeth of the screeching squall. Out of the abysmal darkness of the black cloud overhead white hail streamed on her, rattled on the rigging, leaped in handfuls off the yards, rebounded on the deck--round and gleaming in the murky turmoil like a shower of pearls. It passed away. For a moment a livid sun shot horizontally the last rays of sinister light between the hills of steep, rolling waves. Then a wild night rushed in--stamped out in a great howl that dismal remnant of a stormy day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say {{that you}} will wait till you have seen him. Say that I may have a hope,--a chance; that if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> cold, and hard, and,--and,--and, just what <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> then I may have a chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At least a thousand," [...] said Poke Stover, but, as <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> mistaken; {{the force}} of the enemy {{numbered}} nearly seven times that many, although, to be sure, they were not all in that immediate vicinity.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Blundell never married, but {{lived with}} his grand niece Mary Ann Harriet Noyes. From the 1871 British Census, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> living at 80 Piccadilly in London, {{but he also had}} a home in Westminster at No. 1 Great George Street.|$|R
60|$|Lucy and Eliza's family relations, I {{am sorry}} to say, were not, we found, of a kind to endear them to a {{critical}} public already sufficiently scandalized by their general mode of behaviour to their inoffensive neighbours. As mothers, indeed, gossip itself had not a word of blame to whisper against them; but as wives, their conduct was distinctly open to the severest animadversion. The males of the garden spider, {{as in many other}} instances, are decidedly smaller than their big round mates; so much so is this the case, indeed, in certain species that they seem almost like parasites of the immensely larger sack-bodied females. Now, just as the worker bees kill off the drones as soon as the queen-bee has been duly fertilized, regarding them as of no further importance or value to the hive, so do the lady-spiders not only kill but eat their husbands as soon as they find they have no further use for them. Nay, if a female spider doesn't care for the looks of a suitor who is pressing himself too much upon her fond attention, her way of expressing her disapprobation of his appearance and manners is to make a murderous spring at him, and, if possible, devour him. Under these painful circumstances the process of courtship is necessarily to some extent a difficult and delicate one, fraught with no small danger to the adventurous swain who has the boldness to commend himself by personal approach to these very fickle and irascible fair ones. It was most curious and exciting, accordingly, to watch the details of the strange courtship, which we could only observe {{in the case of the}} cruel Eliza, the rather gentler Lucy having been already mated, apparently, before she took up her quarters in our climbing white rose-bush. One day, however, a timid-looking male spider, with inquiry and doubt in every movement of his tarsi, strolled tentatively up on the neat round web where Eliza was hanging, head downward as usual, all her feet on the thread, on the look-out for house-flies. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a male at once by his longer and thinner body, and by his natural modesty. He walked gingerly on all eights, like an arachnid Agag, in the direction of the object of his ardent affections, with a most comic uncertainty in every step he took towards her. His claws felt the threads as he moved with anxious care; and it was clear he was ready at a moment's notice to jump away and flee for his life with headlong speed to his native obscurity if Eliza showed the slightest disposition, by gesture or movement, to turn and rend him. Now and again, as he approached, Eliza, half coquettish, moved her feet a short step, and seemed to debate within her own mind in which spirit she should meet his flattering advances--whether to accept him or to eat him. At each such hesitation, the unhappy male, fearing the worst, and sore afraid, would turn on his heel and fly for dear life as fast as eight trembling legs would carry him. Then, after a minute or two, he would evidently come to the conclusion that he had wronged his lady-love, and that her movement was one of true, true love rather than of carnivorous and cannibalistic appetite. At last, as I judged, his constancy was rewarded, though his ominous disappearance very shortly afterwards made me fear for the worst as to his final adventures.|$|E

"Clive Davis {{had just}} taken over RCA Records and <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{not a fan of}} our band and {{certainly}} didn’t like me or our music much...We knew this album was going to virtually end up stillborn. I remember walking around to seven different record stores that day and finding only one copy of the new album." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fairly sure. Of course, {{we might}} have <b>been</b> mistaken. But <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in Crumville--Laura was sure of that--and {{it would be just}} like him to sneak up to our place to see what he could do to annoy or injure us." ...|$|R
60|$|The tramp {{was caught}} between two fires, as it were, {{and did not}} know what to do. As <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a good deal of a coward at heart, and the sight of the shotgun in Snap's hands made him quake.|$|R
6000|$|... "Big {{and rather}} quiet, {{although}} he had a twinkle. Weighs all he says, and you feel that if he's satisfied he doesn't mind if you <b>are</b> or not. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> up North for some time; he looks like it, if you get me." ...|$|R

5000|$|On September 26, {{in front}} of a {{hometown}} crowd of 8,471 in attendance, Wilder beat French boxer Johann Duhaupas (32-2, 20 KOs) by TKO in the 11th round at the Legacy Arena, Alabama. Duhaupas, who was battered and bloodied claimed he still had plenty of fight left when referee Jack Reiss waved off his brave challenge. Duhaupas had never been stopped before in his career inside the distance. It was a very one sided fight, after taking punishment in round 7, referee Jack Reiss went over to Duhaupas' corner telling him he would need to do more or he would stop the fight. Wilder was ahead on all judges scorecards at the time of stoppage (100-90, 99-90, 99-91). Wilder landed 326 of 587 punches thrown (56%), whilst Duhaupas landed 98 of 332 (30%). In the post fight, Wilder praised Duhaupas' toughness, [...] "We knew he was tough. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> mentally tough. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to come. That's why you can't criticize nobody you don't know. The most scariest people are the ones you don't know." [...] For the fight, Wilder made $1.4 million and Duhaupas earned a $140,000 purse. The fight was the main even of Premier Boxing Champions on NBC and averaged 2.2 million viewers, peaking at 3 million viewers.|$|E
