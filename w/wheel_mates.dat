Phase I - 50 Coupés, 50 Convertibles and phase II (ROW) - 94 Coupés and 175 Convertibles were produced in celebration of Jaguar's 2001 return to Formula One (F1) racing. They featured unique platinum paint finish (only available on the Silverstone XKR), specific badges and tread plates, a high-performance package (with the same engine as the standard XKR, but improved transmission, steering, suspension and brakes), 20-inch Silver BBS <b>wheels</b> <b>mated</b> to nearly 14 inch front Brembo's {{in the front and}} 13 inch rears producing a remarkable 60 to 0 in a scant 103 feet and a custom interior (red-stitched black leather and silver birds-eye maple wood) [...] All possible factory options were included, {{with the exception of the}} telephone and the navigation system, which had to be ordered separately. The production figures for the U.S.( [...] Jaguar's biggest market) are 31 coupes and 139 convertibles. All Silverstones were manufactured in calendar year 2000, the last one being a coupe for the Japanese market built on 12/23/2000. Motorweek posted a 0 to 60 time of 4.9. The coupe in the harder setting often produced a skip in the CD changer. The dealer fix was to tell the owners to use the soft mode when listening to a CD.|$|R

60|$|His countenance {{was calm}} and composed, but the cook’s {{forehead}} had wrinkled itself into {{his hair in}} a strong brain effort, while Ben was looking for light on the deck, and not finding it.

50|$|As {{the input}} torque of the {{driveshaft}} {{tries to turn}} the differential center, internal pressure rings (adjoining the clutch stack) are forced sideways by the pinion cross shaft trying to climb the ramp, which compresses the clutch stack. The more the clutch stack is compressed, the more coupled the <b>wheels</b> are. The <b>mating</b> of the vertical ramp (80-85° in practice to avoid chipping) surfaces in a one-way LSD on overrun produces no cam effect or corresponding clutch stack compression.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the hub has three main {{elements}} - a splined hub to locate the <b>wheel</b> and two <b>mating</b> cones, one at the inner end which centres the wheel and the other at the nut end. These cones transmit {{the majority of the}} torque to the wheel freeing the splines of much of the load. One of the key features of the Pugh design is that it is self tightening. The wheels {{on the right side of}} the car have a left hand thread on the nut and vice versa. If the wheel becomes loose the tendency is for the locking nut to tighten and hold the wheel securely.|$|R
60|$|As Mr Dicey did {{not seem}} {{inclined}} to say more, the captain went below and flung himself on a locker, having given orders {{that he should be}} called if any change for the worse took place in the weather. Soon afterward a tremendous sea rose high over the stern, and part of it fell on the deck with a terrible crash, washing Mr Dicey into the lee-scuppers, and almost sweeping him overboard. On regaining his feet, and his position beside the <b>wheel,</b> the second <b>mate</b> shook himself and considered whether he ought to call the captain. Having meditated some time, he concluded that the weather was no worse, although it had treated him very roughly, so he did not disturb the captain's repose.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the method of}} the discretization of the gear tooth flank in involute segments for the determination of conjugate gear tooth profiles. Instead of following a point-to-point analytical approach {{to the problem of}} determining the path of contact and the geometry of the generating rack and the <b>mating</b> <b>wheel,</b> the actual tooth flank is considered to be composed of infinitesimal local involutes and therefore a closed solution can be achieved. Due to its simplicity, the method is faster than the standard theory of gearing and this is particularly useful in problems requiring iterative calculations of the tooth geometry such as gear optimization. The method is implemented on modified involute as well as loboid gears used in lobe pumps and it is verified against existing theories. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|International audienceGestational {{hypertensive}} disorders, such as preeclampsia, affect 6 % to 8 % of all pregnancies in North America, {{and they}} are the leading cause of maternal mortality in industrialized countries, accounting for 16 % of deaths. Women with hypertension have an increased risk (15 % to 25 %) of developing preeclampsia. Our aim was to investigate the mechanisms implicated in preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension and in the protective effects of exercise in a mouse model. Female mice overexpressing human angiotensinogen and human renin were used as a model of preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension. In the trained group, mothers were placed in cages with access to a <b>wheel</b> before <b>mating,</b> and they remained within these throughout gestation. Blood pressure was measured by telemetry. We found that angiotensin II type I receptor was increased, whereas the Mas receptor was decreased in the placenta and the aorta of pregnant sedentary transgenic mice. This would produce a decrease in angiotensin-(1 - 7) effects in favor of angiotensin II. Supporting the functional contribution of this modulation, we found that the prevention of most pathological features in trained transgenic mice was associated with a normalization of placental angiotensin II type 1 and Mas receptors and an increase in aortic Mas receptor. We also found reduced circulating and placental soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase- 1 in trained transgenic mice compared with sedentary mice. This study demonstrates that modulation of the renin-angiotensin system is a key mechanism in the development of preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension, which can be altered by exercise training to prevent disease features in an animal model...|$|R
60|$|The {{latter part}} of this {{assertion}} {{seemed to be more}} warranted by facts than the former, but Evans made a choking noise, which he intended as a sign of unbearable joy, and, relinquishing the <b>wheel</b> to the <b>mate,</b> walked forward. The clear sky was thick with stars, and a mind at ease might have found enjoyment in the quiet beauty of the night, but the skipper was too interested in the behaviour of the young couple at the wheel to give it a thought. Immersed in each other, they forgot him entirely, and exchanged little playful slaps and pushes, which incensed him beyond description. Several times he was on the point of exercising his position as commander and ordering the mate below, but in the circumstances interference was impossible, and, with a low-voiced good-night, he went below. Here his gaze fell on William Henry, who was slumbering peacefully, and, with a hazy idea of the eternal fitness of things, he raised the youth in his arms, and, despite his sleepy protests, deposited him in the mate’s bunk. Then, with head and heart both aching, he retired for the night.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the hitherto unknown matutinal mating behaviour of Aeshna grandis {{and found that}} matings basically occurred at dawn. With the first morning light males began performing a searching flight for females that roosted deep in terrestrial vegetation characterized by reed, rush and grass. Matutinal mating in the distinctive twisted wheel position is documented. Twisted wheels are unique as they are not formed in flight but while perching on vegetation and they show no readiness to escape. The twisted position, with the male hanging upside down and his appendages being obliquely slipped across the female’s head, {{is the result of}} the formation of <b>mating</b> <b>wheels</b> with the female perched. Later in the morning we observed feeding flight at suitable sites and resting in low vegetation of a wet meadow. During this resting phase some males inspected the vegetation on the wing, described here as ‘mid-morning searching flight’. In this situation and also when foraging individuals aggregated, we found untwisted, upright hanging couples, which we interpret as wheels formed in flight – an indication of alternative mating tactics. Aeshna viridis, also known to exhibit matutinal matings, occurred syntopically and behaved similarly. We interpret the energy-sapping searching flight at dawn as sexual selection: females select genetic quality by choosing only the fittest mates. uploaded for Odonatologica by Plaz...|$|R
40|$|Micropitting {{damage is}} one of the failure modes {{commonly}} observed in gears leading to destructive failures, which in turn results in unplanned shutdown and expensive replacement, such as those observed in wind turbine gearboxes. This study investigates gear micropitting initiation and propagation when subjected to varying torque loads under a constant rotational speed. The study employs both experimental gear testing and analytical evaluation based on the ISO Technical Report of Gear Micropitting, ISO/TR 15144 - 1 : 2010 and the recently revised ISO/TR 15144 - 1 : 2014. Initiation and propagation of micropitting are assessed in testing by quantifying the development of micropits and their progressive rate after specific numbers of running cycles at step-up torque levels. The analytical study is conducted to validate the prediction of micropitting using the ISO/TR recommended procedures by comparing the results with the occurrence of micropits in the tested gears. The gear test results show that micropitting initiates at the pinion dedendum but escalates at the addendum, because of the greater severity of progressive micropitting at the dedendum of the <b>mating</b> <b>wheel</b> where the tip relief area first comes into mesh. The analytical results, based on varying surface roughness measurements obtained from the tested gears, confirm that the maximum contact stresses and minimum specific lubricant film thicknesses occur in these regions. The specific lubricant film thickness varies considerably because of changes of surface roughness after gears are subjected to various running cycles under varying torque levels. It has found that the excessive loading, gear tooth micro-geometry, surface roughness and lubricant film thickness are the main factors affecting micropitting...|$|R
