5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control <b>welding</b> <b>current</b> can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E
5|$|To {{identify}} different electrodes, the American Welding Society {{established a}} system that assigns electrodes with a four- or five-digit number. Covered electrodes made of mild or low alloy steel carry the prefix E, followed by their number. The first two or three digits of the number specify the tensile strength of the weld metal, in thousand {{pounds per square inch}} (ksi). The penultimate digit generally identifies the welding positions permissible with the electrode, typically using the values 1 (normally fast-freeze electrodes, implying all position welding) and 2 (normally fast-fill electrodes, implying horizontal welding only). The <b>welding</b> <b>current</b> and type of electrode covering are specified by the last two digits together. When applicable, a suffix is used to denote the alloying element being contributed by the electrode.|$|E
5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the <b>welding</b> <b>current.</b> The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} the <b>weld</b> <b>current</b> on the {{microstructure}} and mechanical properties of a resistance spot-welded twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steel sheet was investigated using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy–electron back-scattered diffraction (SEM–EBSD), microhardness measurements, a tensile shear test and fractography. Higher <b>weld</b> <b>currents</b> promoted the formation of a macro expulsion cavity in the fusion zone. Additionally, higher <b>weld</b> <b>currents</b> led to a higher indentation depth, a wider heat-affected zone (HAZ), coarser grain structure and thicker annealing twins in the HAZ, and a relatively equiaxed dendritic structure in the centre of the fusion zone. The hardness values in the weld zone were lower than that of the base metal. The lowest hardness values were observed in the HAZ. No strong relationship was observed between the hardness values in the weld zone and the <b>weld</b> <b>current.</b> A higher joint strength, tensile deformation and failure energy absorption capacity were obtained with a <b>weld</b> <b>current</b> of 12 kA, a welding time of 300 ms and an electrode force of 3 kN. A complex fracture surface with both brittle and limited ductile manner was observed in the joints, while the base metal exhibited a ductile fracture.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the machine specific instantaneous current wave forms on weld nugget dimensions and weld strength is investigated over six spot welding machines. It is observed {{that the nature of}} the real-time current wave forms corresponding to a common rms value can vary in different ac spot welding machines. The variations exist in the values of peak current and in the current-on and -off times in every ac cycle. It is observed that real-time current wave form involving higher peak current leads to slightly larger weld nugget diameter compared to wave form with smaller peak current even if the overall rms value remains similar The real-time current wave form from a medium frequency dc confirms-to a fast rise to the set <b>weld</b> <b>current</b> and remains steady for the complete weld time. A detailed experimental study has depicted that-the real-time ac wave forms especially with high peak values and sharp rise characteristics offer a relatively smaller permissible range of <b>weld</b> <b>currents</b> compared to the wave forms with relatively flatter characteristics. The steady instantaneous current wave form confirming to the medium frequency dc machine has facilitated a larger permissible range of <b>weld</b> <b>current.</b> A numerical analysis of the spot welding process based on finite element process is carried out using both the instantaneous current wave forms and the corresponding rms values of <b>weld</b> <b>current.</b> The predicted <b>weld</b> dimensions using instantaneous current wave forms have showed slightly better agreement with the corresponding measured weld dimensions...|$|R

500|$|The {{level of}} heat input also affects weld quality. [...] Low heat input, caused by low <b>welding</b> <b>current</b> or high welding speed, can limit {{penetration}} and cause the weld bead to lift {{away from the}} surface being welded. If {{there is too much}} heat input, however, the weld bead grows in width while the likelihood of excessive penetration and spatter increase. Additionally, if the welding torch is too far from the workpiece the shielding gas becomes ineffective, causing porosity within the weld. This results in a weld with pinholes, which is weaker than a typical weld.|$|E
500|$|In the pulsed-current mode, the <b>welding</b> <b>current</b> rapidly {{alternates}} {{between two}} levels. [...] The higher current state {{is known as}} the pulse current, while the lower current level is called the background current. [...] During the period of pulse current, the weld area is heated and fusion occurs. [...] Upon dropping to the background current, the weld area is allowed to cool and solidify. [...] Pulsed-current GTAW has a number of advantages, including lower heat input and consequently a reduction in distortion and warpage in thin workpieces. [...] In addition, it allows for greater control of the weld pool, and can increase weld penetration, welding speed, and quality. [...] A similar method, manual programmed GTAW, allows the operator to program a specific rate and magnitude of current variations, making it useful for specialized applications.|$|E
