50|$|Wet {{welding with}} a stick {{electrode}} is done with similar equipment to that used for dry welding, but the electrode holders are designed for water cooling and are more heavily insulated. They will overheat if used out of the water. A constant current welding machine is used for manual metal arc welding. Direct current is used, and a heavy duty isolation switch is installed in the <b>welding</b> <b>cable</b> at the surface control position, so that the welding current can be disconnected when not in use. The welder instructs the surface operator to make and break the contact as required during the procedure. The contacts should only be closed during actual welding, and opened at other times, particularly when changing electrodes.|$|E

The first is a concept utilizing a ground plate to which crew station, avionics racks, electrical power distribution system, master electrical common connection assembly and marshall mated elements system grounds are connected by 4 / 0 <b>welding</b> <b>cable.</b> An alternate approach has an aluminum sheet interconnecting the signal ground reference points between the crew station and avionics racks. The comparison analysis quantifies {{the differences between the}} two concepts in terms of dc resistance, ac resistance and inductive reactance. These parameters are figures of merit for ground system conductors in that the system with the lowest impedance is the most effective in minimizing noise voltage.

From the time the GMAW process was introduced, typical shielding gas flow sys-tems utilize a minimum pressure of 170 kPa (25 lb/in. 2) as the output of regulator/flowmeters and flow gauge regulators for cylinder use or in pipeline gas supply. This pressure provides au-tomatic flow compensation for the inevitable gas restrictions that occur in production.

50|$|For {{applications}} that need even more flexibility, even more strands are used (<b>welding</b> <b>cables</b> are the usual example, but also any application {{that needs to}} move wire in tight areas). One example is a 2/0 wire made from 5,292 strands of #36 gauge wire. The strands are organized by first creating a bundle of 7 strands. Then 7 of these bundles are put together into super bundles. Finally 108 super bundles are {{used to make the}} final cable. Each group of wires is wound in a helix so that when the wire is flexed, the part of a bundle that is stretched moves around the helix to a part that is compressed to allow the wire to have less stress.|$|R

Voltage sensing at the out put terminals of secondary winding of welding transformer {{is used as a}} one and only input signal for the control circuit. Reduced voltage 24 VAC is supplied to primary during idling and during operation it converts in to 400 VAC, and this conversion takes place automatically. By that, able to reduce idling power loss on primary winding due to open circuit core loss & iron loss. During designing of new system special attention was made, not to change existing conventional welding procedure and not to introduce additional external sensors and cables other than conventional welding electrode and <b>welding</b> <b>cable.</b> New system was practically implemented in yard and tested for long period of time in different work conditions in Colombo Dockyard PLC.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{experimental}} characterization of a commercial industrial welding equipment with respect to magnetic field emissions up to 400 kHz. The frequency range of this analysis {{is due to the}} fact that the equipment under test is a manual metal arc (MMA) welding power source using inverter technology and an active dynamic control, resulting in frequency components in the tens and hundreds of kHz range. A simple and low cost new measurement probe consisting of three mutually perpendicular concentric coils for magnetic field analysis up to 400 kHz has been developed. This equipment has been combined with a commercial one for the analysis at low frequencies down to 5 Hz. Experimental data have been obtained at 400 A, maximum current for the equipment under test, with a resistive load corresponding to an MMA conventional load voltage of 36 V, in agreement with Standard EN 60974 - 1.

[...] Divers usually use around 300-400 amps of direct current to power their electrode, and they weld using varied forms of arc welding.

50|$|The {{pontoons}} for {{the bridge}} were fabricated in the Duwamish Waterway in Seattle; during fabrication, {{two of the}} pontoons sank. When they were attached for the first time, and then towed into place and anchored, sea conditions in the Hood Canal were too severe and the pontoons were returned to a nearby bay until a better method of attaching could be devised. The structural engineers and the contractor decided the design was faulty. A new contractor was hired and the design modified. It was decided to use a large rubber dam between {{each of the two}} pontoons as they were attached, clean the concrete surfaces of all marine growth, epoxy, and tension them with a number of <b>cables</b> <b>welded</b> to a variety of attachment points. This system seemed to work from when the bridge opened in 1961 until the disaster of 1979.|$|R
40|$|Objectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the susceptibility of an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator to electromagnetic interference in an electrically hostile work site environment, with the ultimate goal of allowing the patient to return to work. Background. Normal operation of an implanted cardioverterdefibrillator depends on reliable sensing of the heart's electrical activity. Consequently, there is concern that external electromagnetic interference from external sources in the work place, especially welding equipment or motor-generator systems, may be sensed and produce inappropriate shocks or abnormal reed switch operation, temporarily suspending detection of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Methods. The effects of electromagnetic interference on the operation of one type of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (Medtronic models 7217 and 7219) was measured by using internal event counter monitoring in 10 patients operating arc welders at up to 900 A or working near 200 -hp motors and 1 patient close to a locomotive starter drawing up to 400 A. Results. The electromagnetic interference produced two sources of potential interference on the sensing circuit or reed switch operation, respectively: 1) electrical fields with measured frequencies up to 50 MHz produced by the high currents during welding electrode activation, and 2) magnetic fields produced by the current in the <b>welding</b> electrode and <b>cable.</b> The defibrillator sensitivity was programmed to the highest (most sensitive) value: 0. 15 mV (model 7219) or 0. 3 mV (model 7217). The ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation therapies were temporarily turned off but the detection circuits left on. Conclusions. None of the implanted defibrillators tested were affected by oversensing of the electric field as verified by telemetry from the detection circuits. The magnetic field from 225 -A welding current produced a flux density of 1. 2 G; this density was not adequate to close the reed switch, which requires ∼ 10 G. Our testing at the work site revealed no electrical interference with this type of defibrillator. Patients were allowed to return to work. The following precautions should be observed by the patient: 1) maintain a minimal distance of 2 ft (61 cm) from the <b>welding</b> arc and <b>cables</b> or large motors, 2) do not exceed tested currents with the welding equipment, 3) wear insulated gloves while operating electrical equipment, 4) verify that electrical equipment is properly grounded, and 5) stop welding and leave the work area immediately if a therapy is delivered or a feeling of lightheadedness is experienced...|$|R
40|$|Apparatus for {{sensing the}} {{magnitude}} of a load on a cable as the cable is employed to support the load includes a beam structure clamped to the cable so that a length of the cable lies along the beam structure. A spacer associated with the beam structure forces a slight curvature in {{a portion of the}} length of cable under a cable no-load condition so that the portion of the length of cable is spaced from the beam structure to define a cable curved portion. A strain gauge circuit including strain gauges is secured to the beam structure by <b>welding.</b> As the <b>cable</b> is employed to support a load the load causes the cable curved portion to exert a force normal to the cable through the spacer and on the beam structure to deform the beam structure as the cable curved portion attempts to straighten under the load. As this deformation takes place, the resistance of the strain gauges is set to a value proportional to {{the magnitude of}} the normal strain on the beam structure during such deformation. The magnitude of the normal strain is manipulated in a control device to generate a value equal to the magnitude or weight of the load supported by the cable...|$|R
500|$|Filming was {{temporarily}} delayed on September 2, 2010, when an extra was seriously injured during a stunt in Hammond, Indiana. Due to a failed <b>weld,</b> a steel <b>cable</b> snapped {{from a car}} being towed and hit the extra's car, damaging her skull. The extra, identified as Gabriela Cedillo, had to undergo brain surgery. The injury has left her permanently brain-damaged, paralyzed on her left side and her left eye stitched shut. Paramount admitted responsibility for the accident and covered all of Cedillo's medical costs. Nevertheless, Cedillo's family filed a lawsuit on October 5, citing seven counts of negligence against Paramount, and several other defendants (not including Bay), with total damages sought in excess of $350,000. Cedillo's attorney, Todd Smith, said, [...] "This was an attractive 24-year old girl who had dreams and aspirations involving acting, {{and this kind of}} injury may well have a serious impact on her dreams." [...] The filed complaint reads that [...] "Cedillo has endured and will in the future endure pain and suffering; has become disfigured and disabled; has suffered a loss of the enjoyment of a normal life; has been damaged in her capacity to earn a living; has incurred and will in the future incur expenses for medical services, all of which are permanent in nature." [...] In response to the suit, Paramount released the following statement: [...] "We are all terribly sorry that this accident occurred. Our thoughts, prayers and best wishes are with Gabriela, her family and loved ones. The production will continue to provide all the help we can to Gabriela and her family during this difficult time." [...] On May 2012, it was revealed that an $18 million settlement had been reached between Paramount and the Cedillo family.|$|R
