25|$|Track {{bicycles}} do {{not have}} brakes, because all riders ride {{in the same direction}} around a track which does not necessitate sharp deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all track bicycles are fixed-gear, meaning that there is no freewheel. Without a freewheel, coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is moving, the cranks are moving. To slow down, the rider applies resistance to the pedals, acting as a braking system which can be as effective as a conventional rear <b>wheel</b> <b>brake,</b> but not as effective as a front <b>wheel</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|E

25|$|An older Sachs {{drum brake}} kit ("Hydro Pull") allows {{to rebuild a}} regular Sachs bicycle drum brake to {{hydraulic}} lever and action. A piston is added outside the drum instead of the bowden clamp. This solution is often seen on modified Long John cargo bikes, allowing a low friction lever pull front <b>wheel</b> <b>brake</b> action. After Sachs ceased production of this kit a similar solution is sometimes done by welding on a Magura piston to the drum cylinder lever. Welding was necessary because the Magura action is reverse {{to that of the}} Sachs kit.|$|E

2500|$|The Trident was {{routinely}} able {{to descend}} at rates {{of up to}} 4500ft/min (23m/s) in regular service. In emergency descents it was permissible to use reverse thrust of up to 10,000ft/min. Below 280kn IAS, it was also possible to extend the main landing gear for use as an airbrake. The Trident's first version, Trident 1C, had the unusual capability of using reverse thrust prior to touchdown. The throttles could be closed in the flare and reverse idle set to open the reverser buckets. At pilot discretion, up to full reverse thrust could then be used prior to touchdown. This was helpful to reduce hydroplaning and give [...] very short landing runs on wet or slippery runways while preserving <b>wheel</b> <b>brake</b> efficiency and keeping <b>wheel</b> <b>brake</b> temperatures low. Brakes were fitted with the Dunlop Maxaret anti-skid system.|$|E
2500|$|Pit {{bikes are}} {{frequently}} heavily customized with decorative add-ons and performance-enhancing parts.

There were no injuries {{to the flight}} crew of two. The airplane was 60 pounds over Max. takeoff weight and during the long [...] taxi to position for takeoff the crew used a higher than normal power setting and rode the brakes in an attempt lower weight by burning fuel.

2500|$|The Meteor has a pod-and-boom style {{fuselage}}, with a long, single-piece canopy {{above the}} upper fuselage line, {{forward of the}} wing, under which the pilot sits in a reclined position. [...] The under-wing, retractable monowheel undercarriage is assisted by a short, retractable, forward skid. [...] Retraction is manual; there is a <b>wheel</b> <b>brake.</b> [...] Behind the wing the fuselage has a circular cross-section. [...] There is a long, shallow fillet or sub fin between fuselage and fin, both straight edged, and both rudder and fin extend well below the lower fuselage line to form a tail bumper. The rudder is horn balanced. Later revisions slightly increased rudder area. The high aspect ratio, straight tapered tailplane is mounted above the fuselage on the fillet forward of the fin's leading edge. [...] The elevators are also aerodynamically balanced and originally carried a ground adjustable trim tab, later removed.|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{statements}} {{given by}} the pilots to the NTSB reveal {{a number of factors}} that {{may have contributed to the}} accident. The pilots stated they based their decision to land on braking action reports of [...] "good," [...] which they received from air traffic control before landing (based on reports given by aircraft landing immediately before them). Another Delta MD-88 landed on the same runway just three minutes prior to the accident flight's landing. The runway appeared [...] "all white" [...] to the pilots when they broke out of the overcast, indicating it was covered with snow. The NTSB investigation found that runway snow clearing had most recently taken place about 20â€“25 minutes prior to the accident. Upon landing, the pilots noted that the automatic spoilers did not deploy to slow the aircraft as they should have, but the first officer quickly deployed them manually. Also, the autobrakes were set to [...] "max," [...] but the pilots did not sense any <b>wheel</b> <b>brake</b> deceleration. The captain also reported that he was unable to prevent the airplane from drifting left.|$|E

2500|$|... 1 September 1957 - {{a diesel}} hauled train of 12 wooden {{carriages}} leaves Kingston for Montego Bay. The outbound journey had 900 passengers on board, correlating {{with the design}} limit of 80 passengers per carriage. However, the return journey had 1,600 passengers loaded at 130-150 persons per carriage including hundreds {{of members of the}} Holy Name Society of St. Anne's Roman Catholic Church, hundreds of pickpockets, and their targets the tourists who made up over 1,000 of the total passenger loading. At 23:30 near Kendal, Manchester three shrill whistle blasts signalled that the driver had lost control of the train, and it derailed minutes later at speed. 200 people lost their lives, and 700 sustained injuries in the worst transport disaster in Jamaica's history, and the second worst rail disaster in the world at that time. The cause of the accident was determined to be the closure of an angled <b>wheel</b> (<b>brake)</b> cock, with survivors suggesting that the pickpockets had tampered with the brakes while riding on the carriage platforms. Confidence in the rail service was shaken and much looting and robbing of the dead and injured occurred after the crash. The ensuing investigation found a number of deficiencies within the Jamaica Railway Corporation, which was resultantly given its independence in 1960.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cockpit of}} the Sky is of {{standard}} Slingsby design and {{built on the}} same jigs as those used on the Gull IV and Kite II, with a single piece perspex canopy hinged on the starboard side. [...] It is placed immediately {{in front of the}} leading edge of the wing and the fuselage neck on which the wing is mounted. [...] Behind the cockpit the fuselage is a semi-monocoque structure, with a stress bearing 1/16 in (1.6mm) plywood skin formed over light frames positioned by three longitudinal stringers. There is additional strengthening around the wheel bay, where the single wheel has its axle held clear of the fuselage by small triangular pieces. An ash skid is mounted away from the fuselage, running forward to the nose. [...] The <b>wheel</b> <b>brake</b> is applied at the greatest air brake extension. [...] As a weight saving alternative to the mono-wheel, a jettisonable two wheel dolly can be used for take-off. [...] Another ash skid at the rear forms a bumper. [...] The tail unit was initially identical to that of the Gull IV: the tailplane has a ply covered leading edge and fabric behind, mounted forward of the ply covered fin so that the rudder hinge is in line with the trailing edge of the single piece, fabric covered elevator. [...] The latter carries trim tabs.|$|E

50|$|Brakes are {{generally}} applied to rotating axles or wheels, {{but may also}} take other forms such as {{the surface of a}} moving fluid (flaps deployed into water or air).

Each of the two cars were provided with a <b>wheel</b> <b>brake</b> that acted on all four wheels, and two grip brakes (one for each end) that acted on the central cable conduit slot. However, they were actuated manually (the <b>wheel</b> <b>brake</b> by a lever, the grip brake by a handwheel and chain in a manner similar to conventional tramcar brakes). The latter was too slow to apply {{in the event of a}} car runaway, and the former was found to be insufficient to hold the car when the rails were slippery.|$|E
