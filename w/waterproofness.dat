5000|$|In horology, the <b>waterproofness</b> of a {{watch is}} defined by its {{resistance}} under pressure. The manufacturers indicate mostly the degree of <b>waterproofness</b> in metres (m), feet (ft) or atmospheres (atm). Watches with the [...] "waterproof" [...] name, with or without indication of overpressure, have to be complied and have to undergo successfully the tests planned in the standard ISO-2281. These watches are intended for a current daily use and have to resist to the water during exercises such as the short-term swimming.|$|E

The Delfin line of watches launched in 1961, with industry-first double case backs for high standards of shock protection, water resistance, and ruggedness. The Hydrosub line was launched in 1963 featuring the first crown system with tension ring allowing <b>waterproofness</b> of 500 meters. In 1965 Victor Flury-Liechti took over the company from his uncle, and invested in new manufacturing technologies. This led to the 1970 Geoscope timepiece, the first watch covering all time-zones. In 1973, the third-generation Delfin was released. It used elements from to the Gerald Genta-designed Audemars Piguet Royal Oak.|$|E

50|$|A rugged tablet {{computer}} may be semi-rugged or fully rugged. The semi-rugged {{might have a}} protective case, rain-resistant body. Fully rugged tablets are engineered from the inside-out to work in extreme temperatures and other harsh conditions. They are designed to resist drops, shocks and vibrations while maintaining strength to be dust- and waterproof. A tablet has internally a solid state hard drive and no moving parts. It doesn't need a fan as a laptop requires, improving its dust and <b>waterproofness.</b> Many rugged ones have options such as a barcode scanner because they serve in the logistics and transport sector. The levels of ruggardization of a tablet are not standardized within the telecommunications industry, but they are measured by various certifications such as IP, MIL-STD-810 or ATEX.|$|E
50|$|Tent fabric {{may be made}} of many {{materials}} including cotton (canvas), nylon, {{felt and}} polyester. Cotton absorbs water, so it can become very heavy when wet, but the associated swelling tends to block any minute holes so that wet cotton is more waterproof than dry cotton. Cotton tents were often treated with paraffin to enhance water resistance. Nylon and polyester are much lighter than cotton and do not absorb much water; with suitable coatings {{they can be very}} waterproof, but they tend to deteriorate over time due to a slow chemical breakdown caused by ultraviolet light. The most common treatments to make fabric waterproof are silicone impregnation or polyurethane coating. Since stitching makes tiny holes in a fabric seams are often sealed or taped to block these holes and maintain <b>waterproofness,</b> though in practice a carefully sewn seam can be waterproof.|$|E
50|$|Marine canvas is a catch - all {{phrase that}} covers {{hundreds}} of materials, for instance: acrylics, PVC coated polyester vinyls, silicon treated substrates and many coated meshes {{suitable for outdoor}} use. Most ¨marine canvas¨ materials offer UV and UVB resistance, and, to some extent, water resistance or <b>waterproofness.</b> One {{of the most popular}} fabrics used today is solution dyed acrylic such as Sunbrella. Such synthetic fabrics last for many years before deteriorating due to harsh UV rays. UV damages varnish (causes degradation, loss of color and elasticity and finally cracking and peeling) and the materials of which sails are made (often Dacron today). To avoid constant boat repair, covers are fabricated for all sails that are left outside, and all , or highly varnished wood. Hatches are covered for interior sun protection and winches are covered to protect them from deterioration of airborne particles and rain.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePreen glands {{exist in}} almost every bird species and several non-exclusive {{functions}} have been proposed for this gland and the oils that it produces. One function generally admitted is that the oily secretions of the preen gland would provide a waterproofing layer when spread over feathers. Alternatively, several authors have proposed that plumage <b>waterproofness</b> is mostly due to the spatial micro-structure of feathers. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine, by manipulating the access to the preen gland, the effect of the preen oil on the plumage <b>waterproofness</b> and condition. To explore this question, we carried out two independent experiments where we temporarily blocked access to the preen gland secretions with a removable mechanism in one group of captive mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), whilst a second group of birds had access to gland secretions. In a long-term experiment (3 months of treatment) and a short-term experiment (10 days), we measured plumage water retention and condition. After 3 months without access to preen glands, we found a significant decrease of plumage condition and an associated increase in plumage water retention. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between plumage condition and water retention ability. In contrast, after 10 days of treatment, no significant effect was found on plumage condition and water retention. Our study shows that preen oil acts to maintain plumage condition and suggests that feather microstructure is essential to maintain plumage <b>waterproofness...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} the <b>waterproofness</b> of {{desulfurization}} building gypsum had been improved by polyacrylamide(PAM) emulsion. The effect of dosage and molecular weight of PAM emulsion {{on the physical}} mechanical properties and <b>waterproofness</b> have been investigated and XRD, SEM have been employed to determine the phase compositions of the material. The results showed that softening coefficient of desulfurization building gypsum increased from 0. 34 to 0. 69, the compressive strength after soaking in water for 24 h increased from 4. 9 MPa to 6. 1 MPa. The effect of PAM emulsion modification prepared by PAM with molecular 3 million weight of on desulfurization building gypsum are better than with molecular weight of 5 million. The effect mechanism of PAM on desulfurization building gypsum was that PAM reacts with the Ca 2 + cations produced desulfurization building gypsum hydration to form the ionic compounds acting as a filler and reinforcement in the porosity of desulfurization building gypsum, and also PAM covered the surface of desulfurization building gypsum particles to prevent the crystallization of CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} the research results of high performance modified concretes with complex hydrophobization modifiers and hydrophobic tragers. It {{is known that}} the concrete durability largely depends on its filtering characteristics, which can be lowered by adding hydrophobization additives to the concrete compositions, which, in turn, reduce the concrete strength and raise the concrete creep. The objective of the research {{was to develop a}} method of concrete hydrophobization without reducing its strength by applying hydrophobic water insoluble organic-and-mineral tragers. The paper provides the compositions of developed complex hydrophobization additives and water insoluble organic-and-mineral tragers. The influence of hydrophobization modifiers on the concrete workability has been studied as well. It was proved that complex hydrophobization modifiers allow producing high-mobility concrete mixtures and reducing their water separation value by 15 … 20 % providing high preservation of concrete mixtures. The cube and prism strength values for concretes with modifiers are by 15 … 20 % higher as compared to the concrete without additives. It was proved that the creep flow for all examined modified concrete samples was by 10 … 20 % higher, and the concrete creep had damped characteristics. It was shown that the use of complex hydrophobization modifiers may reduce the water absorption as well as the capillary infiltration effect in concrete by 3 … 3. 5 times. The concrete <b>waterproofness</b> is considerably improved as well; the <b>waterproofness</b> grade is almost 3 levels higher as compared to the concrete without additives...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to determine the effect of Silica Fume (SF) and ground granulated blast- furnace slag (GGBS) Incorporating Super plasticizers on Concrete properties. The experimental program was divided in two phases: First phase : preliminary studies on basic materials and the effect of recommended doses of admixtures on the properties of fresh and hardened concrete. Second phase: concrete testing program which contains four mixes: • Ordinary reference mix. • Two mixes with admixtures silica fume (SF) (5 % & 7 %) and Super plasticizers (dosage 1. 3 litter/ 100 kg cement). • One mix with admixtures ground granulated blast- furnace slag (GGBS) (50 %) and Super plasticizers (dosage 1. 3 litter/ 100 kg cement). The results of preliminary tests were carried out to ensure that the main constituents of concrete were adequate and conforming with the requirements of the standards. The results of second phase were studied and analysed as follow: • The research indicated that the replacement of Portland cement by silica fume admixture (5 % & 7 %) increase the compressive strength of concrete, especially at the early age of concrete. • The Research indicated that the use of silica fume in concrete decrease the permeability of concrete and greater <b>waterproofness</b> obtained. IV • The research indicated that the replacement of Portland cement by ground granulated blast- furnace slag (GGBS) admixture (50 %) demonstrated that the early (3 - 7 days) strength of GGBS concrete is significantly lower than that of OPC concrete, and that the 28 -day strength was very similar to that of OPC concrete. • The Research indicated that the use of ground granulated blastfurnace slag (GGBS) admixture in concrete decrease the permeability of concrete and greater <b>waterproofness</b> obtained.

40|$|A new macroporous, {{waterproof}} and breathable {{material has}} been synthetized. The synthesis {{of these materials}} consists in {{a modified version of}} the classical resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) xerogels synthesis. This new process includes a further treatment, after the gelation-curing-drying process, with methanol at 240 °C in order to passivate the hydrophilic phenolic groups of the surface of the RF xerogel. It was found that the treatment time strongly depends on the pore size of the xerogels. After reaching a threshold time, the hydrophilic materials become superhydrophobic. It is postulated that the exohedral inner surface of the porous xerogels, different from most porous materials, is responsible for this behavior. Although the materials exhibit a superhydrophobic behavior against liquid water and maintain its <b>waterproofness</b> for a long period of time, they are able to adsorb/desorb water vapor, which makes them also breathable.

40|$|This thesis proposes {{the design}} of {{portable}} housing for use in scientific research applications in remote locations. Currently, remote research is conducted from tents or other portable shelters. Larger, more hospitable structures are often too heavy or bulky to carry to these locations. This thesis proposes a shelter that is lightweight, packable, and biodegradable. The shelter is constructed of cardboard panels, which can easily be left to decompose in most environments, or can be recycled after use. The shelter is meant to last only for one season (up to six months), and then be recycled. The shelter requires upkeep {{on a weekly basis}} to maintain its <b>waterproofness,</b> and responds to the climatic changes of its surroundings by opening or closing as temperature and conditions warrant. It is, hopefully, much more livable than a tent. This thesis explores a method of studying the city of Banaras, located in the north-central part of India, through Satyajit Ray's movie Aparajito (1957). This method attempts to disengage the all-subsuming sacred aura of Banaras to reveal underlying historic and cultural formations. As the inter-play between the movie and the city excavates peripheral discourses engrained in the film, these discourses are further subjected to the aesthetic parameters of Ray. His engagement with traditional practices and the psychology of individuals re-structure different cultural and spatial aspects of Banaras. Through the simultaneously engagement with the aesthetics of the film and Banaras multiple readings are formed. This process of re-aestheticizing Banaras reaches its conclusion in are-edited 'Aparajito'. By inhabiting the film I attempt to reveal the manner in which Ray positions and contextualizes the characters of the film to the city and its culture. by Keith V. McCluskey. Thesis (M. Arch.)
