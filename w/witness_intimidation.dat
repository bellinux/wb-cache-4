25|$|On November 29, 2012 Ramush Haradinaj {{was acquitted}} a second time. This time, {{due to the}} extreme {{diligence}} of the court and of the parties there was no allegation of <b>witness</b> <b>intimidation.</b> Instead the judges found {{that not only was}} there no evidence to convict Mr. Haradinaj, the Court held that the evidence established that he had acted to prevent criminal behaviour where he could.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial was}} {{regarded}} as farcical, with reports of blatant <b>witness</b> <b>intimidation</b> and evidence tampering. For example, fragments of a broken car light found at the Navarra murder scene which had been identified as belonging to an Alfa Romeo car owned by Leggio had, {{by the time of}} the trial, been replaced by bits of a broken light from a completely different make of car. The judges and prosecutors were sent anonymous letters threatening them with death.|$|E

According to the District Attorney, Habay engaged in a campaign of harassment against several individuals involved in litigation against him.|$|R
40|$|The {{protection}} of <b>witnesses</b> from <b>intimidation</b> or harm {{has become a}} firmly entrenched part of modern criminal justice systems. The ICC’s decision-making with regard to procedural and non-procedural protective measures has on one hand reinforced the integrity and success of the judicial process, while {{on the other hand}} has led to numerous interpretational and applicability challenges of both policy and legal framework. This article aims at designating policy-oriented jurisprudence as a possible theoretical approach and solution to the ICC’s international law making of witness protective measures. Policy-oriented jurisprudence approaches international law as a decision-making process where decisions are made pursuant to shared community interests and expectations. This is likely to aid an adviser, scholar, or those entrusted with decision-making to pay particular attention to all factors necessary for the security of witnesses...|$|R
25|$|Because <b>witness</b> <b>intimidation</b> {{had been}} such an {{important}} issue during the initial trial, witness protection was a prominent feature in both trials. During both trial the Prosecution took great pains to protect the identity of witnesses called to testify. This often included, voice modification, pseudonyms, {{and in some cases}} witness relocation. During the retrial, the Court took the extraordinary measure of moving the entire court to an undisclosed secret location in order to secure the testimony of a protected witness. These efforts paid off.|$|E
25|$|In {{a series}} of reports between 1898 and 1900, Ermanno Sangiorgi, the police chief of Palermo, {{identified}} 670 mafiosi belonging to eight Mafia clans that went through alternating phases of cooperation and conflict. The report mentioned initiation rituals and codes of conduct, as well as criminal activities that included counterfeiting, kidnappings for ransom, murder, robbery, and <b>witness</b> <b>intimidation.</b> The Mafia also maintained funds to support the families of imprisoned members and pay defense lawyers. In an attempt to annihilate the Mafia, Italian troops arrested 64 people of Palermo in February 1898.|$|E
25|$|For years, Turner {{has engaged}} in a {{campaign}} of intimidation against public officials and private citizens alike. Even Turner’s arrest in this case failed to deter him. Turner continued his tactics by using intimidation against a key witness in the government’s case against him. All the while, Turner has displayed defiance and no regret for his actions. Turner remains utterly incapable of acknowledging the genuine fear experienced by his innumerable victims – that is, except when he {{is the victim of}} a perceived threat. Turner has committed a serious crime, engaged in <b>witness</b> <b>intimidation,</b> lied repeatedly under oath, and has shown no regret whatsoever.|$|E

5000|$|Kirkus Reviews {{described}} Mob Lawyer as a [...] "riveting {{memoir of}} life inside the murderous world of Mafia chieftain Santo Trafficante and Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa, by their personal lawyer" [...] and an [...] "insider's impossible-to-put-down account of life within the 'Honorable Society.'" [...] In a review for ABA Journal, Martin Kimel {{called it an}} [...] "intelligent memoir" [...] and wrote: [...] "Despite the seaminess of its cast of characters, Mob Lawyer is engrossing reading and an object lesson in lifestyles {{of the rich and}} infamous." [...] Publishers Weekly said: [...] "The story, which profits from the smooth style of New York Times crime reporter Raab, has less impact as an account of a man who woke up too late than for its revelations about significant events of our time." [...] Ronald Goldfarb reviewed the book for The Washington Post stating: [...] "Ragano's biography of his career is full of naive rationalizations about the virtues of these men he cavorted with and represented..., and self-serving criticism of the government's Gestapo-like tactics, selective prosecution, use of spies as <b>witnesses</b> and <b>intimidation</b> of suspects' families." [...] Goldfarb added, [...] "Cynics will wonder whether Mob Lawyer is merely the latest entry in the books-by-crooks genre. Except for the shocking disclosures about his deceased former clients, {{there is no reason to}} read this book. With them, however, it joins a select few that provide critical links in the circumstantial case that the mob planned JFK’s killing." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Gacaca {{court system}} faced many controversies and challenges; they {{were accused of}} being puppets of the RPF-dominated government. The judges (known as Inyangamugayo, which means [...] "those who detest dishonesty" [...] in Kinyarwanda) who preside over the {{genocide}} trials were elected by the public. After election, the judges received training, but there was concern that the training was not adequate for serious legal questions or complex proceedings. Furthermore, many judges resigned after facing accusations of participating in the genocide; 27.1% of them were so accused. There was also a lack of defense counsel and protections for the accused, who were {{denied the right to}} appeal to ordinary courts. Most trials were open to the public, but there were issues with <b>witness</b> <b>intimidation.</b> The Gacaca courts did not try those responsible for massacres of Hutu civilians committed by members of the RPF, which controlled the Gacaca Court system.|$|E
2500|$|Gotti {{was tried}} three times by {{federal and state}} officials, but was acquitted each time, earning him the {{nickname}} [...] "The Teflon Don." [...] It {{turned out that the}} trials had been compromised by <b>witness</b> <b>intimidation,</b> juror misconduct, and jury tampering. Gotti's flamboyance, however, proved to be his undoing. The FBI had managed to bug an apartment above his headquarters in the Ravenite Social Club in Little Italy, where an elderly widow let mobsters hold top-level meetings. Gotti was heard planning criminal activities and complaining about his underlings. In particular, he complained about Gravano, portraying him as a [...] "mad dog" [...] killer. Gravano responded by turning state's evidence and testifying against Gotti {{and other members of the}} family. Gotti and consigliere Frank [...] "Frankie Loc" [...] LoCascio were convicted on all charges on April 2, 1992, largely on the strength of Gravano's testimony, and sentenced to life without parole.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, Gravano {{and several}} {{other members of the}} Gambino family became disenchanted with Gotti's lust for the media and {{high-profile}} antics, feeling they brought too much heat. Several members of the family informed Gravano that Gotti's high profile and large gatherings of mob members at the Ravenite Social Club were constant targets for the FBI and that the media attention put a large spotlight on the Gambinos. Many members of the family, according to Gravano, complained to him about Gotti's use of Gravano in murders despite Gravano's position as underboss of the family. Members were also concerned about Gotti's frequent appearances in court. He was first tried for assaulting a refrigerator repairman over a parking space. Through <b>witness</b> <b>intimidation,</b> he was acquitted. Gravano had paid a juror in Gotti's second trial to vote in favor of an acquittal allowing Gotti to beat the RICO charges lodged against him. Gotti's third trial on state assault charges ended the same way. Gotti's ego began to bother Gravano as well as several other members of the family. Gotti was first known as the [...] "Dapper Don" [...] in the press for his Brioni suits and hand-painted ties as well as his well-combed hair and quick wit with reporters. Gotti required Gravano and Gambino consigliere Frank LoCascio to be at the Ravenite social club five days a week and all of his captains to make an appearance once a week. When Gravano warned Gotti about the negative attention from reporters as well as the constant surveillance from the FBI, Gotti instructed Gravano not to worry about it, as Gotti said that {{he knew what he was}} doing.|$|E
50|$|Gary Tyler, St. Rose. He {{was charged}} {{at the age}} of 16 for a capital crime and convicted in 1975 of first-degree murder by an all-white jury, despite the lack of {{physical}} evidence. There has long been controversy about the case, as the alleged weapon disappeared from police custody, and <b>witnesses</b> complained of <b>intimidation</b> by police; four later recanted their testimony. He was sentenced to death as required by the mandatory provisions of the state law. This was ruled as unconstitutional in 1976 by the United States Supreme Court. In 1977 the state supreme court commuted his sentence to life without parole. In 1980 the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated his conviction and called for a new trial, but the next year it reversed its position because of his original court-appointed attorney's error at trial. In 2012, the sentence of life imprisonment without parole also was ruled unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court for persons who were minors at the time of a crime for which they were convicted. The state court reviewed his case; in 2016 Tyler accepted a plea deal in order to gain his freedom; he pleaded guilty to manslaughter after serving 41 years, nearly twice the maximum of 21 years for this charge. He had been recommended three times for pardons, but governors failed to act.|$|R
