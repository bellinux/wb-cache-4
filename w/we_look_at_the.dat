The Reese’s brand also accounts for over 47% of all seasonal sales within the {{convenience store}} channel, with the top two items in all four seasons (Valentine's, Easter, Halloween, and Holiday). As a comparison, the next largest brand accounts for only 10% of seasonal sales.|$|E

But I felt he was a greenhorn, {{and it turned out}} he didn't have {{experience}} in decision-making." [...] As for McCain, Eastwood reflected, [...] "I voted for McCain, not because he was a Republican, but because he had been through war (in Vietnam) and I thought he might understand the war in Iraq better than somebody who hadn't. I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff." [...] On August 3, 2012, he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, suggesting that Romney would boost the country and [...] "restore a decent tax system... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [...] who's paying taxes and who isn't." [...] During a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood talked to an empty chair as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it. The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different. [...] "My only message was [...] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked. I'd probably say something else but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly. That's {{the way to do it}} in life and every other subject, but sometimes in America we get gaga, <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wrong values." ...|$|E

It is the consequences the statement holds for that person’s purposes which constitute its meaning, and its usefulness in accomplishing that person’s purposes that constitutes the statement’s truth or falsity. After all, when <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sentence [...] "diamonds are hard" [...] in a particular situation we may find it actually has {{nothing to say about}} diamonds. A speaker may very well be using the sentence as a joke, as a codephrase, or even simply {{as an example of a}} sentence with 15 letters.

Scott noted that while perhaps the ABC was more concerned about gay marriage than about electricity prices, he did not accept the criticism of bias because [...] "a lot of that criticism comes from right wing commentators and they wonder where are the strong right wing commentators on the ABC.

[...] Following the interview, conservative ABC critic Andrew Bolt wrote [...] "How can the man heading our biggest media organisation be so blind to the ABC's unlawful and dangerous Leftist bias?" [...] while former Media Watch host Jonathan Holmes wrote for The Age that this interview indicated that ABC management had failed to recognise a clear problem of left wing bias among some capital city radio presenters.|$|E

2500|$|The alleged {{intention}} of the law, which was published during World War I, was a [...] "temporary movement of the Ottoman citizens" [...] during the conflicts and not the permanent displacement as there was a decree (regulation, or adjunct) {{with respect to the}} relocated citizens by the [...] "Tehcir Law" [...] who wanted to return; it claimed [...] "except those people , no one else will be touched." [...] Also if <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fourth section of the Tehcir law, it was specifically designed to hold the enforcer units responsible to follow up and record the properties owned by the subjects of the immigration. The law included a responsible party for the protection of properties the owners could/will return in a later term. Another law was passed to regulate the enforcement of this section On 10 June 1915. In this section, it was demanded that there would be three copies of this information; one kept in the regional churches, one in the regional administration, and one kept by the commission responsible for the execution of the law.

2500|$|The {{economies of}} the world have {{developed}} unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis. From around 1980 through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly developing countries, life expectancies began to rise. If <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Gini coefficient for world income, since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed—between Asia and the advanced {{economies of the}} West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally. [...] Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little. Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark. With a few exceptions—France, Japan, Spain—the top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead, while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind. [...] By 2013, a tiny elite of multibillionaires, 85 to be exact, had amassed wealth equivalent to all the wealth owned by the poorest half (3.5 billion) of the world's total population of 7 billion.|$|E
