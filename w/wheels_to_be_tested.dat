40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of wear tests obtained for 4 groups of materials: surface-hardened alloy steels and alloy cast steels for structural applications, hard-wearing surface-hardened alloy cast steels, and austempered alloy cast irons. The wear <b>tests</b> have <b>been</b> performed on a specially designed test rig that allows reproducing the real operating conditions of chain wheels, including the rolling and sliding form of contact between elements. The chain <b>wheels</b> subjected <b>to</b> <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> operated with the use of loose quartz abrasive. This study presents results of measurements of material parameters, micro-structure of a surface subject to wear, as well as the linear wear determined for the materials considered. Based on the results, the following was found: the best wear properties were obtained for surface-hardened alloy steels and wear surface; strengthening of the ADI surface took place - most probably as a result of transformation of austenite into martensite; the uniformity {{of the structure of the}} materials affects the surface wear process. The study also indicated a significant degree of graphite deformation in ADI characterized by the upper ausferritic structure and its oblique orientation in relation to the surface, which resulted in a facilitated degradation of the surface caused by the quartz abrasive...|$|R
40|$|The current {{practice}} for experimentally evaluating {{the performance of}} extraterrestrial rovers/rover <b>wheels</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> conduct <b>tests</b> on earth on a soil simulant, appropriate to the regolith on the extraterrestrial body of interest. In the tests, the normal load (force) applied by the rover/rover <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> the soil simulant <b>is</b> set identical <b>to</b> that expected on the extraterrestrial surface, taking into account its acceleration due to gravity. It should be pointed out, however, that the soil simulant used in the <b>tests</b> <b>is</b> subject <b>to</b> earth gravity, while the regolith on the extraterrestrial surface <b>is</b> subject <b>to</b> a different gravity. Thus, it is uncertain whether {{the performance of the}} rover/rover wheel obtained from tests on earth represents that on the extraterrestrial surface. This issue has been explored previously. A method has been proposed for conducting tests of the rover/rover wheel on earth with identical mass to that on the extraterrestrial surface, instead of with identical normal load used in the {{current practice}} [1]. This paper provides further evidence to substantiate the merits of the proposed method, based on a detailed analysis of the test data obtained under various gravity conditions, produced in an aircraft undergoing parabolic flight manoeuvres [8]. In the study, the effect of slip on wheel sinkage has been evaluated. It is found that gravity has little effect on the slip and sinkage relationship of the rover wheel under self-propelled conditions. ...|$|R

50|$|Imagine {{that the}} true {{rotation}} of a four-spoke wheel is clockwise. The first instance of visibility of the wheel may occur when one spoke is at 12 o'clock. If {{by the time the}} next instance of visibility occurs, the spoke previously at 9 o'clock has moved into the 12-o'clock position, then a viewer will perceive the <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stationary. If at the second instance of visibility, the next spoke has moved to the 11:30 position, then a viewer will perceive the <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rotating backwards. If at the second instance of visibility, the next spoke has moved to the 12:30 position, then a viewer will perceive the <b>wheel</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rotating forwards, however more slowly than the wheel is actually rotating. The effect relies on a motion perception property called beta movement: motion is seen between two objects in different positions in the visual field at different times providing the objects are similar (which is true of spoked wheels—each spoke <b>is</b> essentially identical <b>to</b> the others) and providing the objects are close (which is true of the originally 9-o'clock spoke in the second instant—it <b>is</b> closer <b>to</b> 12 o'clock than the originally 12-o'clock spoke).|$|R
