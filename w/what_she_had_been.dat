500|$|Brady {{admitted}} under police questioning {{that he and}} Evans had fought, but {{insisted that}} he and Smith had murdered Evans between them; Hindley, he said, had [...] "only done <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> told". Smith told police that Brady {{had asked him to}} return anything incriminating, such as [...] "dodgy books", which Brady then packed into suitcases. Smith had no idea what else the suitcases contained or where they might be, but he mentioned in passing that Brady [...] "had a thing about railway stations". The police consequently requested a search of all Manchester's left-luggage offices for any suitcases belonging to Brady, and on 15 October British Transport Police found {{what they were looking for}} at Manchester Central railway station—the left-luggage ticket was found several days later in the back of Hindley's prayer book. Inside one of the suitcases were nine pornographic photographs taken of a young girl, naked and with a scarf tied across her mouth, and a 13-minute tape recording of her screaming and pleading for help. Ann Downey, Lesley Ann Downey's mother, later listened to the tape after police had discovered the body of her missing 10-year-old daughter, and confirmed that it was a recording of her daughter's voice.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} of Enough wanted Lopez {{to write a}} new song for the film. According to Lopez, writing a song is something that cannot be forced; [...] "It kinda just has to happen". While on their honeymoon in October 2001, Cris Judd played Lopez a melody that he had written on the piano. She thought that the melody was [...] "really beautiful" [...] {{and that it would}} make a [...] "wonderful song". Lopez felt that a [...] "little bit of it sounded like the movie, a little haunting". When she heard the melody, Lopez said to herself: [...] "I can write something to that right now. And we can use it in Enough". She then began to think about the film and the character that she portrays and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> through. In addition, she also thought about the things that she had gone through in her own life. According to Lopez, it was easy to be inspired by the melody Judd had written, [...] "and just kind of that grateful feeling, to just be here [...] And keeping it simple. Because life can get so crazy and everything. And then you realize, it's all just kinda about the simplicity of being here, and being healthy. And being alive. So that's where the song came from." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to her {{dissatisfaction with}} Kisss {{constrained}} timeframe of two months, Jepsen went into writing Emotion {{with the intent}} of crafting a project that was authentic and timeless. Whereas Kiss was developed in a acquiescent manner as Jepsen was simply grateful for the opportunity, Emotion was spurred by her desire to take more creative control. Jepsen commented that much of the album is about [...] "trying to get some power back" [...] after a recent break up and subsequent move to New York. She sought to channel a [...] "heart-on-your-sleeve sensibility" [...] reminiscent of the 1980s era after attending a Cyndi Lauper concert in Japan: [...] " [...] this is when pop was at its finest. [...] I would put out 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' today and I wouldn’t change a bloody thing." [...] These themes were further explored through [...] "old-school" [...] Prince and Madonna records on morning runs before Cinderella rehearsals. An epiphany came to Jepsen after finishing [...] "Emotion", the album's title track, where she realized that the 1980s pop sound combined with a more [...] "alternative" [...] production was <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> seeking. This fashioned the album's direction entirely, which developed as the midway point between the [...] "pure" [...] pop she recorded in Los Angeles and the indie folk effort that was scrapped in New York. Jepsen has stated that the album is not strictly a period piece, but is [...] "tinted with shades of that era".|$|E
2500|$|On June 17, 2015, a {{radio host}} from KDND stated that [...] "Good for You" [...] would be {{featuring}} ASAP Rocky. On the next day, On June 18, 2015, Gomez posted a short spoken-word snippet which music journalists widely speculated {{to be the}} song's intro. In the snippet, Gomez said: [...] "But I'm blinded by the sun. I'm reborn at every moment, so who knows what I'll become?" [...] A heavy bass beat featured {{for a few seconds}} before the snippet, in which Gomez captioned, [...] "I feel like I can exhale". According to Christina Garibaldi of MTV News the snippet echoed an earlier statement Gomez made on Instagram where she said her listeners would learn the truth about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> experiencing on her upcoming album. On June 20, 2015, the song leaked online. On June 22, 2015, [...] "Good for You" [...] received its radio premiere across all iHeartRadio contemporary hit radio stations at 06:00 EST (11:00 UTC) — which also played the track at the top of every hour in that day —, and was released as a digital download at 00:00 EST (05:00 UTC).
