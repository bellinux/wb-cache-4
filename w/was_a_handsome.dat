5|$|Atangana {{travelled}} {{frequently in}} the French colonial period. He {{made a point of}} attending his subjects' weddings and funerals, for example. He had more opportunities to visit Europe, including the Paris Colonial Exposition in 1931 and the French Colonial Conference in 1935. In 1938, his wife died. Atangana <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>handsome</b> man by Ewondo standards: strong, well groomed, with a reputation as a good fighter, dancer, and husband. He remarried on 6 January 1940 to Julienne or Yuliana Ngonoa, a young Beti woman of the Mvog Manga sublineage from the village Nkolafamba. She bore him two children: Marie-Thérèse and René Grégoire. Atangana seems to have adhered to Catholic strictures against polygamy, despite the fact that other Beti chiefs at the time had several hundred wives.|$|E
5|$|Character {{designer}} Tetsuya Nomura {{has explained}} that Vincent's character shifted {{from that of}} horror researcher, to detective, to chemist, and finally to {{the figure of a}} former Turk with a tragic past. Director Yoshinori Kitase {{was in charge of the}} cutscene in which Vincent joins the party, while scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wrote his backstory. Nojima had a great deal of trouble with Vincent's dialogue, as he very rarely speaks. In the original script of the game, Vincent was introduced in a similar fashion, but <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>handsome,</b> sarcastic personality. He would join Cloud's group after learning they were in pursuit of Hojo, but he had no knowledge of the results of the experimentation to which he was subjected. Additionally, he would be also privy to more information regarding Shinra's involvement with the creation of Sephiroth, and it is he who would explain to Cloud the story of Sephiroth's origins. When the game was still in development, Nomura and his staff considering removing Vincent and Yuffie Kisaragi altogether, as they did not have enough time to work them into the story properly. As a result, Vincent and Yuffie ultimately appeared as optional characters in the game.|$|E
5|$|The Creeper sneaks out and escapes while Donelly and Gates {{infiltrate}} his hideout {{and discover}} Jimmy's corpse. Donnelly also finds a newspaper clipping {{with a man}} named Hal Moffet {{and two of his}} friends, Clifford Scott (Tom Neal) and Virginia Rogers (Jan Wiley), during their college days. The police visit Clifford and Virginia, who are now married and wealthy. Clifford tells the officers during college, Hal <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>handsome</b> college football star who competed with Clifford for Virginia's affections. One day, while helping Hal prepare for a chemistry exam, a jealous Clifford deliberately gave him the wrong answers, resulting in Hal being asked by Professor Cushman to remain after class for extra work. While working on a chemistry experiment, Clifford walks by the window with Virginia to boast. Furious, Hal hurls a beaker to the ground, accidentally causing an explosion that disfigures his face. Donnelly speculates that Hal is the Creeper, and that he killed Professor Cushman and Joan because he holds them partially responsible for his accident.|$|E

25|$|The Belt of Orion Award for Excellence {{was founded}} by Canada's Aviation Hall of Fame in 1988 to honour organizations, groups, {{societies}} or associations who have made outstanding contributions {{to the advancement of}} aviation in Canada. The Belt of Orion Award for Excellence was bestowed upon the Air Cadet League of Canada in 1989. Orion, the son of Neptune, according to Greek Mythology, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>handsome</b> and energetic hunter who possessed the power to walk through the sea and on its surface. Artemis, the Goddess of the hunt, fell in love with Orion, but her twin brother, Apollo, was jealous and sent a scorpion to kill him. In her sorrow and remorse for his death, Artemis placed him in the sky as a constellation. Orion, the Great Hunter, is a brilliant constellation, second to the Big Dipper on the roster of major constellations. It straddles the celestial equator, and is outlined by a quadrilateral of three brilliant stars—Betelgeuse, Bellatrix and Rigel, and one of lesser magnitude. Inside the quadrilateral are three second-magnitude stars forming the Belt of Orion. The three stars of the Belt point south-eastward to Sirius, the brightest star of the heavens.|$|E

[...] She took some nourishment after her lengthy fast and seemed to be recovering. [...] Leopold, who had remained with his wife throughout, apparently took an opiate and collapsed into bed.|$|E

500|$|Steiger {{was born}} on April 14, 1925 in Westhampton, New York, {{the only child of}} Lorraine (née Driver) and Frederick Steiger, of French, Scottish and German descent. Rod was raised as a Lutheran. He never knew his father, a vaudevillian who had been part of a {{traveling}} song-and-dance team with Steiger's mother, but was told that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>handsome</b> Latino-looking man, who was a talented musician and dancer. Biographer Tom Hutchinson describes him as a [...] "shadowy, fugitive figure", one who [...] "haunted" [...] Rod throughout his life and was an [...] "invisible presence and unseen influence".|$|E
500|$|In mid-1891 Lionel Johnson {{introduced}} Wilde to Lord Alfred Douglas, {{an undergraduate}} at Oxford at the time. Known {{to his family}} and friends as [...] "Bosie", he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>handsome</b> and spoilt young man. An intimate friendship sprang up between Wilde and Douglas and by 1893 Wilde was infatuated with Douglas and they consorted together regularly in a tempestuous affair. If Wilde was relatively indiscreet, even flamboyant, in the way he acted, Douglas was reckless in public. Wilde, who was earning up to £100 a week from his plays (his salary at The Woman's World had been £6), indulged Douglas's every whim: material, artistic or sexual.|$|E
500|$|News {{arrived in}} Montevideo in late 1822 that Prince Dom Pedro, son and heir of King JoãoVI, had {{declared}} {{the independence of}} Brazil on 7 September and had been acclaimed emperor as Dom PedroI on 12 October. Marques de Sousa was dispatched to Rio de Janeiro by the Baron of Laguna to pledge loyalty to the Emperor {{on behalf of the}} army in the south. The young alferes was an apt choice for the task; he was well connected in the imperial capital (his uncle, married to a paternal aunt, was Minister of War), cultured, and well educated. Marques de Sousa <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>handsome</b> man of average height with dark, curly hair and brown eyes. Fastidious about his appearance, he always took care to dress well, even during battles, and contemporaries made note of his trimmed and clean nails. He was also merry and gallant, with a [...] "pleasant and well-tuned voice in conversation, ample and resounding in command".|$|E

500|$|Carneiro Leão had a keen eye for {{spotting}} potential, and Paranhos—who {{had revealed}} himself a very capable man {{during his tenure}} as a Liberal politician in Rio de Janeiro province—had talents which could be put to use. As Carneiro Leão told Paranhos when justifying his choice of the young and inexperienced journalist: [...] "I consulted no one about appointing you. What influenced my mind was your merit, which I prize: I hope, sir, that you will prove I got it right." [...] Paranhos <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>handsome</b> and charming man, tall at , with blue eyes and golden hair. Historian Jeffrey D. Needell remarked that in Paranhos, Carneiro Leão had [...] "a man with marked literary skill, with a military background and unusually fine technical knowledge, with political instincts and proven political courage, and with a clear {{need for a new}} patron, with Aureliano 's recent eclipse". That, along with cool-headedness, outstanding oratory skills, inexhaustible energy, and a gifted and cultured mind, made him seem the ideal person for the post.|$|E
500|$|The Brute Man is a quasi-prequel to House of Horrors, {{in which}} Hatton played a {{deformed}} madman named [...] "The Creeper" [...] who kills people by breaking their backs. In The Brute Man Hatton also plays [...] "The Creeper", while the story explains how he became deformed {{and why he}} has a murderous personality. Hatton also played a disfigured killer called the Huxton Creeper in The Pearl of Death, a 1944 Sherlock Holmes film, but neither House of Horrors nor The Brute Man have any connection to that film. In establishing a backstory explaining the Creeper's motives, The Brute Mans script seeks to humanize the character and elicit more sympathy for him than the Creeper's other films, {{in which he is}} generally portrayed as a two-dimensional murderer. The origin of the Creeper is based partially on autobiographical details from Hatton's real life. Before becoming disfigured by an accident, the Creeper <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>handsome</b> young college football hero. Hatton himself was also a football player at the University of Florida before suffering from the effects of acromegaly, a syndrome that causes abnormal bone growth due to excess growth hormone from the pituitary gland. In the film, the character is disfigured by chemicals during a laboratory accident in school. While Hatton's real-life abnormalities stemmed from acromegaly, it was often incorrectly stated by Universal Pictures publicity materials that they were the result of exposure to mustard gas attacks during Hatton's service in World War I.|$|E

2500|$|Known as Modì (which {{plays on}} the French word 'maudit', meaning 'cursed') by many Parisians, but as Dedo {{to his family and}} friends, Modigliani <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>handsome</b> man, and {{attracted}} much female attention. Women came and went until Beatrice Hastings entered his life. She stayed with him for almost two years, was the subject of several of his portraits, including Madame Pompadour, and the object of much of his drunken wrath. When the British painter Nina Hamnett arrived in Montparnasse in 1914, on her first evening there the smiling man at the next table in the café introduced himself as [...] "Modigliani, painter and Jew".

[...] He also said, [...] "No, he didn't do any real police work himself.

It got to where after a while some officers wouldn't tell him anything." ...|$|E

[...] His sister, Mary, who was a frequent companion of Anthony Wayne, lived with Vining, and together they entertained frequently and lavishly. Because of this hospitality and generosity he was known as [...] "the pet of Delaware." [...] But he spent through his fortune and suffering from alcoholism, and the death of his wife, went through a rapid decline on the way to an impoverished and premature death. His sister dedicated herself to raising Vining's four sons, but they died young as well, within a year of her death in 1821.|$|E

[...] The two developed a warm friendship, and it became very clear that he was so restrained that he never made any declaration of love or formal proposal to her. [...] Masha purposely arranged a situation in which {{they would be able to}} talk freely with no one else near.
