When you're pregnant, it's {{a little bit harder}} to breathe, so it was hard doing all the choreography and singing at the same time. I just got my strength from all the love from the fans. I can see all of my super fans in the audience when I'm performing because they're doing the choreography harder than me. Some of the fans were like, 'B, you better put me in this DVD.' So I made sure I did." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mmm Papi" [...] is a latin pop {{song that}} lasts {{for three minutes}} and twenty-two seconds. The song has dancehall {{elements}} and a 1960s go-go vibe, and incorporates into its melody handclaps and a rock guitar. Anna Dimond of TV Guide perceived influences of Madonna's [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] (1987) in the song, and called it an [...] "ode to the tropical life (and perhaps its masculine fruits)". It {{has been suggested that}} its lyrics deal with either her father Jamie Spears or paparazzi [...] However, this was denied by Morier, who said [...] "the song is definitely not about Adnan and in the <b>whole</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> worked with [...] last spring and summer I never once saw that guy." [...] Morier described [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] as a fun upbeat song, while saying the title [...] "came out of [...] Mmm Papa Luv U." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Dylan Kickham described the song as a [...] "bizarre attempt at combining Latin pop with ’60s psychedelic soul".|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was directed by}} Philipp Stölzl and it was filmed in Los Angeles, California in mid-April 2004. Talking about the filming {{and the development of}} the video, Lee said: [...] "There's this one scene with everybody on motorbikes that every time I see it I just crack up. It's the slow-mo scene where I take off the helmet and swoosh my hair and look at the camera ... and it kills me. It's so hilarious, it's ridiculous. [...] It's a really different thing for us to do because it's not performance at all. Everybody was laughing at me the <b>whole</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> was just like, 'Please don't laugh at me. Just give me five minutes so I can do this.'" [...] Lee added that the message of the video is {{in the name of the}} products her character is advertising, each of which are called [...] "Lies" [...] because according to her [...] " [...] whole life is a lie. Every smile, that's a lie." ...|$|E

5000|$|Paul T. Taylor, who portrays Pinhead in Hellraiser: Judgment, {{described}} the character as [...] "twisted and intelligent". Finding Pinhead's mannerisms and demeanor to be unique among horror icons, Taylor tried to capture {{that in his}} performance: [...] "It's about the stillness. He's already so terrifying that when he makes a move, it means something. He's very economical and when he speaks, he's so eloquent." [...] Taylor also incorporated the uncomfortable make-up and costume into his presentation of the sadomasochist, stating [...] "Pinhead’s always in agony so he likes it. I feel like I was in character the <b>whole</b> <b>time,</b> and <b>I</b> don’t mean that {{in some sort of}} artistic, lofty way. I mean I maintained the demeanor the <b>whole</b> <b>time</b> because <b>I</b> had to." ...|$|R
500|$|In his own words, Ocean {{calls the}} album [...] "nostalgic." [...] He explains, [...] "it's {{a longing for}} the past. That's what this record felt like." [...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to get off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the <b>whole</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> guess it all starts with the stories for me." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for the {{extended}} remix of [...] "Video Phone" [...] {{was directed by}} Hype Williams, along with producer Cisco Newman and art director Lenny Tso. On October 15, 2009, a spokesperson for Williams confirmed to MTV, that reports of Gaga and Beyoncé working on the music video together were true. It was shot at Brooklyn's Greenpoint neighborhood, under tight security. The artists were reported to be wearing fashionable dresses, with Knowles in [...] "a feathered dress" [...] and Gaga sporting [...] "something wild". In an interview with New York's Z100 radio station, Gaga further commented on her collaboration with Knowles, for the music video. She said, [...] "When I was doing her video with her, she called me and she said, 'What {{do you want to}} do?' [...] And I'm like, 'I don't want to show up in some frickin' hair bow and be fashion Gaga in your video.' I said, 'I want to do you.' [...] I want to do my version of Beyoncé. So the <b>whole</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was learning the choreography they were calling me Gee-yoncé." [...] Later, during an interview with MTV News, she explained: ...|$|E
2500|$|The studio {{pressured}} Carpenter {{to cast a}} {{rock star}} {{in the role of}} Gracie Law, Jack Burton's love interest, but Carpenter wanted Kim Cattrall. The studio was not keen on the idea because at the time Cattrall was primarily known for raunchy comedies like Porky's and Police Academy. She was drawn to the film because of the way her character was portrayed. [...] "I'm not screaming for help the <b>whole</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> think the humor comes out of the situations and my relationship with Jack Burton. I’m the brains and he's the brawn".|$|E
60|$|Afterwards, in the {{excitement}} of our cousins' visit, the matter passed {{out of my mind}} completely. They stayed two weeks, and I was so busy the <b>whole</b> <b>time</b> that <b>I</b> {{never got a chance to}} develop that third plate and, in fact, I had forgotten all about it.|$|R

I've been qualified now for nine months, and got a post as house-surgeon at our hospital; but I've waited to come and tell you till I'd saved up that money, you know, out of my salary, and now I'm coming back to settle down in practice here, uncle." ...|$|R
2500|$|An {{officer in}} the attack wrote of the {{importance}} of Wellesley's personal leadership: [...] "The General was {{in the thick of the}} action the <b>whole</b> <b>time...</b> <b>I</b> never saw a man so cool and collected as he was... though I can assure you, 'til our troops got the order to advance the fate of the day seemed doubtful..." [...] With some 6,000 Marathas killed or wounded, the enemy was routed, though Wellesley's force was in no condition to pursue. British casualties were heavy: the British losses were counted as 409 soldiers being killed out of which 164 were Europeans and the remaining 245 were Indian; a further 1,622 British soldiers were wounded and 26 soldiers were reported missing (the British casualty figures were taken from Wellesley's own despatch). Wellesley was troubled by the loss of men and remarked that he hoped [...] "I should not like to see again such loss as I sustained on 23 September, even if attended by such gain". Years later, however, he remarked that Assaye and not Waterloo, was the best battle he ever fought.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{deciding}} {{to become a}} full time storyteller, Irwin worked as a stand-up comedian [...] "for a few minutes". [...] During this time, Irwin won the Farber Invitational stand-up competition at the Punchline comedy club in Atlanta. [...] However, Irwin came {{to see that the}} days of storytelling comedians had passed. Irwin also realized that his style of performance was at odds with the main venue available to comedians today: comedy clubs. (Irwin joking refers to comedy clubs as [...] "evil, smelly places".) [...] Some of his stories are an hour in length, and Irwin notes, [...] "here was a time when comedians could do that but they can't anymore because the clubs give them three minutes, and they are timing the laughs per minute." [...] Using storytelling as a theatrical form allows Irwin to create more fully drawn characters and to explore darker subject matters as well. [...] "Although I like to think of my storytelling as funny, I can have these serious moments. I’m not depending on the audience to laugh the <b>whole</b> <b>time...</b> <b>I</b> hope there’s content with the form." ...|$|E
2500|$|The largely unenthusiastic press {{reaction}} to the album caused the individual members of the band to lose faith {{in the concept of}} an ongoing, periodic series of band reunions and ultimately, all five members returned to their own careers following the album's release. [...] In the following years, the band themselves would echo many of the sentiments expressed by the music press, with the general consensus being that the recording of the album was rushed and ill-thought out. [...] Gene Clark offered his thoughts on the album during a 1977 interview: [...] "I am disappointed in that album. Some of the harsh criticism is unjust, because, if you listen to it carefully, the album isn't that bad, but it just hasn't got the punch that it could have had if we'd taken the time." [...] Chris Hillman concurred with Clark, telling The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan [...] "In all honesty, we didn't have enough time on the album. They gave us one-and-a-half months to do that album, expecting guys to regroup after a five to six year absence." [...] Hillman also cited the band's eagerness to avoid conflict as a contributing factor to the album's artistic failure: [...] "everybody was so afraid of stepping on the other person's feet because of the tension that had gone down six years prior to that, that it became a bland album. Everybody was being too nice to each other." [...] McGuinn blamed the reunion album's lack of success, at least partly, on the hedonism exhibited by members of the band during the recording process: [...] "David had this incredibly strong pot. Half a joint and you couldn't do anything. We were stoned out of our minds the <b>whole</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> don't remember much recording." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I {{took out}} my plate, {{put it in}} the holder and {{gathered}} up my traps.

"No wonder," [...] said Miss Winter, [...] "for Flora and Mary tell me {{she hardly}} spends five minutes over it in the morning, and with a book before her the <b>whole</b> <b>time.</b> If <b>I</b> send her up to make it fit to be seen, I meet with looks of annoyance. She leaves her books {{in all parts of}} the school-room for Mary to put away, and her table drawer is one mass of confusion.

"When {{the first}} of hers reached me (as it {{immediately}} did, for I was in town the <b>whole</b> <b>time,)</b> what <b>I</b> felt is--in the common phrase, not to be expressed; in a more simple one--perhaps too simple to raise any emotion--my feelings were very, very painful.--Every line, every word was--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer, were she here, would forbid--a dagger to my heart. To know that Marianne was in town was--in the same language--a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof would she have given me!--her taste, her opinions--I believe they are better known to me than my own,--and I am sure they are dearer." ...|$|R
25|$|I {{turned a}} face to him of such joy that no-one in that great crowd could have had one moment's doubt. I just said, Oh Tom, & he seized my hand, & said how do you do, in quite a loud voice. He walked {{straight}} on to the platform then & gave a most remarkably clever, well thought out lecture.... <b>I</b> stood the <b>whole</b> <b>time,</b> holding Polly up high in my arms. Polly was very excited & wild. I kept my eyes on Tom's face the <b>whole</b> <b>time,</b> & <b>I</b> kept nodding my head at him, & making encouraging signs. He looked a little older, more mature & smart, much thinner & not well or robust or rumbustious at all. No sign of a woman's care about him. No cosy evenings with dogs and gramophones I should say.|$|R

I was blindfolded the <b>whole</b> <b>time,</b> but <b>I</b> would try to see somehow. All you see is blood: your own blood, the blood of others.
