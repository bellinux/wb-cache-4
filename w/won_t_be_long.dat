We have looked far into the future, then on occa¬ sion taken the story back to European settlement of Australia to add perspective. Change can be rapid, slow or anywhere in between. It can be foreseen with a degree of certainty or simply appear out of the unknown. Looking back we now know that China, unexpectedly becoming a communist 2 ̆ 7 capitalist country, doubled its gross domestic product on average every seven years.

Despite these morphological differences between the two species, there are still situations where the two species cannot be easily differentiated. Therefore, the mitochondrial DNA of both species was encoded. Results confirm that the two species are indeed distinct from each other.|$|R

This book {{will help you}} get beyond memorizing electricity-related formulas, rules, and {{procedures}} so you can understand the topic at a deep level deep enough to teach it with confidence and comfort. By covering the basics of static electricity, current electricity, and magnetism, the book develops a scientific model showing that electricity and magnetism are really the same phenomenon in different forms. A bonus feature: access to interactive software that you can download from the NSTA Web site. The software will help you investigate electrical circuits from simple to complex without having to {{buy a lot of}} expensive materials (or risking electrocution!). Electricity and Magnetism is the fifth title in the award-winning NSTA Press Stop Faking It! Series. As author Bill Robertson writes, The book you have in your hands is not a textbook.

40|$|We {{present a}} high {{precision}} frequency determination method for digitized NMR FID signals. The method employs high precision numerical integration rather than simple summation {{as in many}} other techniques. With no independent knowledge of the other parameters of a NMR FID signal (phase ϕ, amplitude A, and transverse relaxation time T_ 2) this method can determine the signal frequency f_ 0 with a precision of 1 /(8 π^ 2 f_ 0 ^ 2 T_ 2 ^ 2) if the observation time <b>T</b> <b>is</b> <b>long</b> enough. The method is especially convenient when the detailed shape of the observed FT NMR spectrum is not well defined. When T_ 2 is +∞ and the signal becomes pure sinusoidal, the precision of the method is 3 /(2 π^ 2 f_ 0 ^ 2 T^ 2) which is one order more precise than a typical frequency counter. Analysis of this method shows that the integration reduces the noise by bandwidth narrowing as in a lock-in amplifier, and no extra signal filters are needed. For a pure sinusoidal signal we find from numerical simulations that the noise-induced error in this method reaches the Cramer-Rao Lower Band(CRLB) on frequency determination. For the damped sinusoidal case of most interest, the noise-induced error is found to be within a factor of 2 of CRLB when the measurement time <b>T</b> <b>is</b> a few times larger than T_ 2. We discuss possible improvements for the precision of this method...|$|R
