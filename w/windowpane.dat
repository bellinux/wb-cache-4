25|$|Traditional {{business}} suits are generally in solid colours or with pin stripes; <b>windowpane</b> checks are also acceptable. Outside business, {{the range of}} acceptable patterns widens, with plaids such as the traditional glen plaid and herringbone, though apart from some very traditional environments such as London banking, these are worn for business now too. The colour of the patterned element (stripes, plaids, and checks) varies by gender and location. For example, bold checks, particularly with tweeds, have fallen out of use in the US, while {{they continue to be}} worn as traditionally in Britain. Some unusual old patterns such as diamonds are now rare everywhere.|$|E
500|$|... the indie {{rock band}} Guillemots have {{recorded}} more than 80 songs for their four studio albums and other official releases. The band {{was formed in}} November 2004, with their first official material being I Saw Such Things in My Sleep, an extended play (EP) released in September 2005. The EP contained four songs, including [...] "Made-Up Lovesong #43", a track that would also feature on their first studio album, Through the <b>Windowpane.</b> The release of I Saw Such Things in My Sleep was followed three months later by Guillemots' debut single, [...] "Trains to Brazil". Like [...] "Made-Up Lovesong #43", it was also included on Through the <b>Windowpane,</b> which was released in July 2006. The album's songs were well received by critics: review aggregator Metacritic gave the record a score of 81 out of 100, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Craig McLean of The Observer described them as [...] "gorgeous tunes that are lithe enough {{to cope with the}} little bursts of sonic madness". Two additional tracks were released as singles from the album: [...] "We're Here" [...] and [...] "Annie, Let's Not Wait".|$|E
500|$|Guillemots' third album, Walk the River, was {{released}} in April 2011. It was the first Guillemots album to feature neither a strings nor brass section– its tracks were described by The Independent as being more [...] "noticeably stripped down" [...] than those of previous releases. Unlike Through the <b>Windowpane</b> and Red, singles from Walk the River were distributed exclusively online, with no accompanying physical release. Reviews were generally favourable, with Metacritic reporting a score of 69 out of 100 for the record. Three singles {{were taken from the}} album: [...] "The Basket", [...] "I Must Be a Lover" [...] and [...] "I Don't Feel Amazing Now". On 7 May 2012, the band announced their intention to release four albums during the year, each representing a different season– the first, Hello Land!, {{was released}} through Greedbag the same day.|$|E

500|$|Since {{forming in}} 2004, Guillemots have {{recorded}} songs {{that have not}} been included on their official releases. At the end of 2005, the band uploaded a demo of their song [...] "Cold Cool Moon" [...] to their official website for fans to download for free. They also uploaded three improvised songs that had been recorded during jam sessions. During a series of live shows in 2006, the group featured in their set lists the Christmas carol [...] "In the Bleak Midwinter" [...] and original songs that had not formed part of Through the <b>Windowpane.</b> One such track, [...] "21st May", was described by The Times as [...] "gleefully [...] a hip-shaking reggae beat to jazz sax". In 2011, Guillemots recorded a version of [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] by John Lennon and Paul McCartney for the BBC's coverage of Glastonbury Festival 2011.|$|E
500|$|McCay came to {{be known}} by his middle name, Winsor. His drawing skills emerged early. [...] According to a story told within the family, McCay made his first drawing in the {{aftermath}} of one of the many fires that hit Spring Lake: he picked up a nail and etched the scene of the fire in the frost of a <b>windowpane.</b> [...] Drawing became obsessive for him; he drew anything he saw, and the level of detail and accuracy in his drawing was noted at a young age. [...] He was able to draw accurately from memory even things he had never before drawn—what McCay called [...] "memory sketching". [...] His father thought little of his son's artistic talents, though, and had him sent to Cleary Business College in Ypsilanti, Michigan. [...] McCay rarely attended classes. [...] He bragged about how he would catch the train to Detroit to show off his drawing skills at the Wonderland and Eden Musee dime museum. [...] He drew portraits there for 25 apiece, of which he kept half.|$|E
500|$|Of {{the twelve}} songs on Through the <b>Windowpane,</b> nine {{were written by}} lead singer Fyfe Dangerfield. Speaking in 2008, Guillemots member MC Lord Magrão remarked: [...] "For the first album, Fyfe handled most of the songs.... We worked with him and {{developed}} [...]" [...] In October 2006, Guillemots brought out Of the Night, a four-track EP that featured one song written by {{each member of the}} band. Eighteen months later, the band released their second album, Red. This album's songs were more pop-orientated than their debut's, and were written by all four members of the group. Magrão explained: [...] "With the second , we ended up improvising loads and getting all the new songs from all of the improvised sessions we had." [...] Of the eleven tracks on the record, nine were credited to Guillemots, with the remaining two being credited to Dangerfield alone. Red songs received less critical acclaim than their debut's; Metacritic awarded the album a score of 60 out of 100, suggesting [...] "mixed or average reviews". Four tracks—"Get Over It", [...] "Falling Out of Reach" [...] and a double A-side of [...] "Kriss Kross" [...] and [...] "Clarion"—were released as singles in the UK.|$|E

Though in poor health at the time, Davis memorized her own and everyone else's lines as she always had. The film earned good reviews, with one critic writing, [...] "Bette crawls across the screen like a testy old hornet on a <b>windowpane,</b> snarling, staggering, twitching—a symphony of misfired synapses." [...] Davis became an honouree of the Kennedy Center Honors for her contribution to films in 1987.|$|E

60|$|She {{went down}} to get herself {{something}} to eat, and Philip watched curiously the process of death. There was nothing human now in the unconscious being that struggled feebly.

A bluebottle buzzed against the <b>windowpane.</b> Suddenly there was a loud rattle, it made Philip start, it was horribly frightening; a movement passed through the limbs and the old man was dead. The machine had run down. The bluebottle buzzed, buzzed noisily against the <b>windowpane.</b>|$|E

60|$|Murray and Lindsay came in {{as he was}} speaking, and Morton {{told them}} of the message that Darnley had brought. Murray moved heavily across to a window-seat, and sat down.
