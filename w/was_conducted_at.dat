5|$|On 21 October 1960, {{the initial}} {{tethered}} flight, performed by XP831, <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>at</b> Dunsfold; {{at this stage}} of development, this feat had required the airframe to have been stripped of all extraneous weight and restrictions on the engine meant it could not be run at full power for more than 2.5 minutes at a time. Several tethered flights took place, partially so that the test pilots could familiarise themselves with the hovering controls; on 4 November, the first tethered flight without use of the auto-stabiliser system was accomplished. In mid-November, conventional taxying trials were performed at speeds of up to 70 knots.|$|E

5|$|The U-boat base at Bergen grew {{exponentially}} {{after the}} liberation of France by the Western Allies, when the senior commanding officer of U-boat operations in the west ("FdU West") was moved from Angers, France to the city. A large expansion program <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>at</b> the base and several new anti-aircraft guns were set up to protect the U-boat bunkers. More engineers and technicians were moved to Bergen to accommodate the increased technical requirements of the base as well. Two more bunkers named Werft Gemeinschaftslager 1 and Gemeinschaftslager 2 were also built during this time.|$|E

Up to 18 Swiss Mirages and Tigers per year conducted air combat maneuvering training on its instrumentation range. Following its fifth SAKA exercise in 1989, however, demands by NATO air forces for the facility resulted in permission for Swiss Air Force usage to be withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|The move to {{functional}} classification {{coincided with the}} rise of sports science. The first detailed international swimming sport science project <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>at</b> the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. This was followed by a similar project at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona. These studies provided an increasingly detailed understanding of the factors involved in high performance swimming. Henceforth sports science became the driver of both performance and classification.|$|E

Richard Nixon, who presided over Johnson's funeral, declined to have a state funeral in 1994. Reagan was the first U.S. former president to die in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|After their {{fitting-out}} stage, the {{two ships}} were put through sea trials {{to ensure they}} met their contracted specifications. The first attempt at putting Michigan through a trial <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>at</b> the navy's traditional testing grounds off Rockland, Maine beginning on 9 June 1909. Although the ship completed its standardization run, other tests were disrupted when it ran aground on a sand bar. Although Michigan was pulled off without incident, the navy soon discovered that both propellers required repair, delaying {{the completion of the}} trials until 20â€“24 June. The battleship was commissioned several months later on 4 January 1910â€”making the United States the third country to have a dreadnought in commission, behind the United Kingdom and Germany, but just ahead of Brazil's â€”and its shakedown cruise lasted until 7 June.|$|E

5|$|Digital {{intermediate}} (DI) <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>at</b> Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad. A high-end DI {{system was}} imported {{and the process}} took six months to complete. Singer Chinmayi, who dubbed for Samantha in Eega, found the process difficult because the footage did not contain the animated fly. Rajamouli approached Anuj Gurwara to write the dialogue for the Hindi-dubbed version titled Makkhi. The Hindi dubbing began in Hyderabad, and Gurwara dubbed for Nani in the film. Ajay Devgan and his wife Kajol, acting as parents telling the film's story to their child at bedtime, provided voiceovers during the opening credits of Makkhi. The visuals accompanying the closing credits were altered to show the fly mimicking the antics of Devgan, Salman Khan, and Akshay Kumar.|$|E
5|$|Early in the game's development, {{the music}} team were shown an early build before {{starting}} {{work on the}} score.

Edgar Froese, Tangerine Dream's founding member, initially rejected the offer of producing music for a video game. After he was flown to the studio and shown the game, he was impressed by its scale and cinematic nature, and changed his mind. Froese's first eight months of work on the score produced 62 hours of music. He recorded with Tangerine Dream in Austria but further work <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>at</b> Jackson's United States studio, which The Alchemist and Oh No used as well.|$|E
