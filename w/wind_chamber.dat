5000|$|Lawrence (Larry) Cleveland Chambers (born June 10, 1929) was {{the first}} African American to command a U.S. Navy {{aircraft}} carrier and the first African American graduate of the Naval Academy to reach flag rank.

50|$|The water {{creating}} the music arrived {{first at the}} top of the ‘’Castellum aquae’. It went first through a series of whirlpools, which mixed air with the water; then it dropped down a pipe into the ‘’camera aeolia’’, or <b>wind</b> <b>chamber,</b> where the air and water were separated; the water turned a wheel, rotating a cylinder which opened the valves of the twenty-two pipes, so the air could pass through the pipes and make the music.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{water is}} {{supplied}} from some height above the instrument through a pipe, and air is {{introduced into the}} water stream by aspiration (using the Bernoulli effect) into the main pipe from a side-pipe holding its top above the water source. Both water and air arrive together in the camera aeolis (<b>wind</b> <b>chamber).</b> Here, water and air separate and the compressed air is driven into a wind-trunk {{on top of the}} camera aeolis, to blow the organ pipes. Two perforated ‘splash plates’ or ‘diaphragms’ prevent water spray from getting into the organ pipes.|$|E

In few places is this more evident than on A Biography of the Rev. Absalom Dawe, on which Surman acts {{as a sort of}} one-man <b>wind</b> <b>chamber</b> ensemble... Elements of modern composition, jazz, and European folk can be heard throughout and the mood is one of reflection and wintry quiet. Overall, this is one of Surman's most daring and yet most successful projects to date".|$|E

50|$|A sompoton {{consists}} of eight pieces of bamboo pipe inserted into a dried gourd sealed with bees wax, {{which serves as}} a <b>wind</b> <b>chamber.</b> Unlike a bamboo flute, which is a straight pipe, the sompoton is a 'mouth organ' as it contains vibrating reeds. Curiously, also unlike a flute which is played only by expelled air; a sompoton can be played by both inhalation and exhalation. In Kota Kinabula, capital of Sabah, at the Filipine crafts market one is likely to find 'ornamental sompotons' with only two reeds; but at the Sabah Cultural Center one finds completely functional/playable sompotons with the full complement of 7 reeds. Traditionally, the individual pipes have their own names, such as lombohon, monongkol, suruk, baranat, randawi, tuntuduk and tinangga.|$|E
