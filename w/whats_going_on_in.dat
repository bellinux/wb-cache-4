5000|$|As Editor, Killenberg’s {{focus was}} on the {{interests}} of the people, resulting in him and his staff putting out [...] "a damned good paper" [...] that won a Pulitzer Prize among other prestigious awards for public service, including the Alfred Sloan Award for stories about highway safety. [...] With his insistence on the localization of national news and humanization of victims beyond mere statistics, he literally brought stories home to the reader. When his story ideas were met with little enthusiasm at meetings with his news editors, Killenberg was known to say, [...] "Nobody’s going to like this story but the readers!" [...] Killenberg shared his passion for local news with Globe-Democrat publisher Richard H. Amberg. Both men were highly involved in civic organizations.

5000|$|The films {{experimental}} plot and dense dialogue were controversially received. Esquires Mike DAngelo claimed that [...] "anybody who claims {{he fully understands}} <b>whats</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> Primer after seeing it just once is either a savant or a liar". Scott Tobias writes for The A.V. Club: [...] "The banter is heavy on technical jargon and almost perversely short on exposition; {{were it not for}} the presence of voiceover narration, the film would be close to incomprehensible." [...] For the Los Angeles Times, Carina Chocano writes: [...] "sticklers for linear storytelling are bound to be frustrated by narrative threads that start promisingly, then just sort of fall off the spool". Some reviewers were entirely put off by the films obfuscated narrative. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter complained that Primer [...] "nearly gets lost in a miasma of technical jargon and scientific conjecture".|$|E
5000|$|Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times was {{the most}} negative, calling the film a [...] "porno chic." [...] He said: [...] "It is {{impossible}} to imagine how Radha Bharadwajs Closet Land {{is going to do}} much good for the cause of human rights in general, and the oppression of women in particular. Surely, anyone with the slightest degree of awareness of <b>whats</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the world knows of the horrible plight of political prisoners subjected to unspeakable torture. Consequently, why should anyone subject himself or herself to this pretentious and contrived two-person drama, which punishes the audience rather than enlightens it?" [...] He criticised the lack of a proper setting for the film, an unnamed police state, saying: [...] "Right off, the filmmaker lets us off the hook, making it easy to reject the incessant cruelty we witness as artificial." [...] Confused about the films lack of focus on a single theme, he added: [...] "In any event, this bit of Freudianism put in the service of protesting child abuse overloads and sidetracks the film from its main purpose of protesting all human rights violations." [...] He finally concluded by praising Madeleine Stowes performance, noting that she [...] "is actually quite moving in her unshakable dignity." [...] On the other hand, he was more critical of Alan Rickmans delivery, noting that [...] "Rickman, whose diction often seems muddled, is needlessly, hissably arch." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{think the}} idea is to—not all the time, and not with a set regularity—but I think it is {{critical}} to explore how he went from the person that he was when he left the island—which is extremely different: hes spoiled, hes entitled, hes a bit of a jerk—and he comes off it something very, very different. So were going to explore how he gets there." [...] —Stephen Amell on the use of flashback storytelling. Arrow features two storylines: one in the present, and the other, shown in flashback, during Olivers time on the island five years before his rescue. These flashbacks are used to illustrate how Oliver transformed into the man that returns to Starling City. Filming for the island flashbacks takes place in Vancouvers Whytecliff Park area, near beachfront homes. Much planning is required to keep the buildings out of camera frame. Guggenheim said, [...] "Stephen Amell has to wear a wig, and his look has to be changed... theres a lot. Its actually incredibly ambitious to do these flashbacks every week, every single episode. Because like Andrew Kreisberg said, its almost like its its own show." [...] Regarding the flashbacks after the fifth season, Guggenheim and Mericle stated that the series would explore flashbacks from other characters perspectives, such as Curtis Holt, along with the possibility of flashfowards. Guggenheim said, [...] "We still want to make flashbacks part of our storytelling, because we do like them. We like when those non-island flashbacks sort of illuminate <b>whats</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the present day. Thatll always {{be a part of the}} show and a part of the shows storytelling structure. It just wont be telling a serialized story." ...|$|E
