The statistical population for sampling and physical analysis includes two hospitals and five health-care centers, selected randomly, and WHO standard procedures were followed for <b>wastes</b> <b>segregation.</b> Results: Based on data obtained, 1335 kg of medical wastes is daily generated in Gachsaran County of which 563 kg are infected and 772 kg are noninfected. A minor part of medical wastes are incinerated or delivered to the municipality untreated. However, the major part is hydroclaved. The largest medical center in the region is Shahid Rajaei Hospital located in Dogonbadan city and infected wastes from the whole region are sent to this center to be hydroclaved. Conclusion: In conclusion, the quantity of infected wastes in the region is higher when compared to other cities in Iran.
