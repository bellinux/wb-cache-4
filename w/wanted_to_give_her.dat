Katharine Hepburn recommended that her great niece, Schuyler Grant, play the role of Anne Shirley. Director Kevin Sullivan liked Grant’s performance and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> the role. However, broadcast executives were resistant to cast an American as a Canadian icon. Schuyler Grant ended up playing Anne’s best friend, Diana, and Anne Shirley was ultimately played by Megan Follows.|$|E

Shelley was particularly captivated by Jane's singing voice, {{to the extent that}} some commentators have suggested it had a hypnotic effect on him. Shelley once purchased a guitar for Jane, and commemorated the gift in the poem [...] "With a Guitar, to Jane". In this poem, he ascribes to her voice the ability to alter the consciousnesses of her audience. Jane kept the guitar for her entire life and played it often. Shelley also purchased her a flageolet and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> a harp, but abandoned that plan due to its expense.|$|E
500|$|Tetsuya Nomura based Yuna's {{overall design}} on hakama, but also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> outfit {{something}} that would flow and so gave her a furisode. Nomura said that her name means [...] "night" [...] in the Okinawan language, which contrasts with Tidus' name, which is Okinawan for [...] "sun". For Final Fantasy X-2, the game's staff wanted Tetsu Tsukamoto to redesign her costume to reflect her personality and the game's atmosphere. Yuna's character was well received by many media critics and fans and in particular praised for her relationship to Tidus, {{as well as her}} characterization and sex appeal. Despite this positive reception, there was a mixed reception for her role in Final Fantasy X-2 due to her redesign.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rap-Up in March 2010, Minaj revealed the title to the song, and Garrett later hinted around details around his single with Minaj, stating, [...] "I just did Nicki’s first single featuring me. It’s gonna be a fucking bomb. It’s very, very explosive! It’s a club banger. It’s a lot broader than what people would expect her to come with. The record puts her in the game {{in a way that}} says she should’ve been here a long time ago. She has a real way of how she wants to do this. It’s just gonna be a surprise when it comes. She just wants to make it as huge as possible." [...] Additionally, co-producer Alex da Kid said, [...] "I started on the train and finished in the studio. I knew it was special from the start. It wasn't like I was aiming for Nicki with this track; I had a idea I thought was crazy. Nicki heard it and the rest was history." [...] In {{an interview}} with MTV News, Minaj stated when she first heard the song she felt she was in Africa {{and fell in love with}} the drum beats, and commented, [...] "It's a very rare. ... You're not gonna get the song the first time you hear it. After the second or third time, you're gonna be like, 'Whoa, what is this?' It sounds nothing like anything that's out right now." [...] She also called the song [...] "next-level futuristic", and said that she chose Garrett for the song in that he would be the best to [...] "illustrate Nicki Minaj", as he got her and her personality". In an interview on the set of the video shoot for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said, [...] "I'm excited for people to hear me ... doing more than one verse. It's really creative. I wanted to be theatrical, but I am very serous about what I do." [...] Also on the set of the video, Garrett said, [...] "We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> something that was global," [...] he continued. [...] "We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> something that was urban; we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> something that was mainstream pop, you know what I mean, that the world could get a chance to see her out on this pedestal. And of course, you know, I had to come along with her, because I've got an album dropping soon." [...] The song made its debut March 29, 2010 on WQHT. The song leaked onto the Internet on March 30, 2010, the day before its music video premiere on 106 & Park. The single's art cover was revealed on April 1, 2010, featuring a still of Minaj in the music video as a ninja and comic book font designs. Alex da Kid said that a lot of artists wanted the beat such as Jamie Foxx and Young Jeezy but he gave it to Nicki because it fit her [...] "quirky, left-field vibe." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Tetsuya Nomura, he based Yuna's {{overall design}} on hakama, {{a type of}} {{traditional}} Japanese clothing. Nomura {{said that when he}} learned the character was to perform a dance called the [...] "sending," [...] he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> outfit something that would flow. For this reason, the specific type of kimono he chose for her was a furisode, a long-sleeved kimono. Nomura also said that he adorned Yuna's dress and necklace with images of the hibiscus flower also called [...] "yuna," [...] and that her name carries the meaning of [...] "night" [...] (夕な) in Okinawan, establishing a contrast between her and the lead male protagonist of Final Fantasy X, Tidus, whose Japanese name (ティーダ) translates to [...] "sun" [...] (太陽) in Okinawan. This contrast is also represented in-game by items named for the sun and moon that empower Tidus' and Yuna's most powerful weapons. Nomura explains that while all these subtle details may be unneeded, he wanted his designs to have meaning behind them.|$|E

500|$|Aware of {{the efforts}} her mother made to give her life, support her and raise her, Millett became a care-giver and {{coordinator}} of many daily therapies, and pushed her mother to be active. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> [...] "independence and dignity". In the article [...] "Her Mother, Herself", Pat Swift wrote: [...] "Helen Millett might have been content to go [...] "gently into that good night"—she was after all more afraid of the nursing home than dying—but daughter Kate was having none of that. Feminist warrior, human rights activists, gay liberationist, writer and artist, Kate Millett has not gone gently through life and never hesitates to rage at anyone—friend or foe, family or the system—to right a perceived wrong. When the dignity and quality of her ailing mother's life was at stake, this book's unfolding tale became inevitable." [...] Even though Helen {{played a role in}} having her daughter committed to the University of Minnesota's Mayo wing, Kate had her mother removed from the nursing home and returned to her apartment, where attendants managed her care. During this period, Millett could also [...] "bully" [...] her mother for her lack of cultural sophistication and the amount of television she watched and could be harsh with caregivers.|$|E
500|$|This pair of episodes {{marks the}} first time that Doctor Who has filmed {{principal}} photography footage within the United States; the American-produced TV movie of 1996 was filmed in Canada, and some second unit establishing shots of New York and the Statue of Liberty were filmed on Liberty Island for the episode [...] "Daleks in Manhattan", but none of the cast of the episode were involved in the shoot. Filming took place in the state of Utah. For the opening shot for the location, director Toby Haynes wanted it to be epic so that the audience could recognise where the episode was set. Scenes on the roadway were filmed on U.S. Route 163 [...] (several miles east of the coordinates listed on the Doctor's invitations). The crew wanted to add as many American icons as they could into those shots, including a Stetson hat, a 1950s Edsel Villager, and a yellow school bus. Moffat, having enjoyed writing episodes featuring River Song, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> an impressive entrance. Haynes had Alex Kingston block the sunlight from the camera angle and blow smoke from her revolver. The scenes involving the picnic and the future-Doctor dying took place on the shore of Lake Powell. The suit worn by the future-Doctor's killer was a fabricated replica of an Apollo space suit. In filming the death scene the filming crew noticed that Karen Gillan was genuinely upset and [...] "was acting her heart out." [...] In filming the [...] "Viking funeral" [...] scene, Haynes wished to film it during the sunset. However, the sun set over the desert, so was instead filmed during sunrise, as the sun rose over the water.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, McAdams {{starred in}} Woody Allen's fantasy romantic comedy Midnight in Paris with her Wedding Crashers co-star Owen Wilson and Michael Sheen. The film opened the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. McAdams played Inez, the shrewish fiancée of Wilson's {{character}} Gil. Allen wrote McAdams' part for her, after hearing [...] "glowing reports" [...] from {{his friend and}} her former co-star Diane Keaton. He {{said that he was}} [...] "crazy about Rachel" [...] and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> the opportunity to play something other than [...] "beautiful girls". The film was shot on location in Paris and McAdams has said that the experience [...] "will always have a great place in my heart". Hadley Freeman The Guardian criticized that she [...] "has morphed from the sweet thing in Wedding Crashers to the dream-crushing bitch that, according to American comedies, women become once they ensnare their man". Richard Corliss of Time [...] "felt sorry for McAdams, whose usually winning presence is ground into hostile cliché". However, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt she [...] "deftly handles a part that is less amiable than usual for her" [...] and A. O. Scott of The New York Times found her [...] "superbly speeded-up". It became Allen's highest-grossing film ever in North America and was the most commercially successful independent film of 2011. With a production budget of $17million, the film has grossed over $151 million worldwide. McAdams, along with six other members of the cast, received a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture nomination. Allen won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and the film itself was nominated for three other Academy Awards, including Best Picture.|$|E

Nyong'o also claimed that Weinstein wanted to take off his pants, when she rejected his advances and left the room terrified.

I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal." [...] She again declined and left the restaurant. She vowed that she would never work with Weinstein, hence her declining a role in Southpaw (2015). Nyong'o mentioned that she hasn't had any more encounters during her time in Hollywood and would rather work with women directors or male feminist directors, who have not abused their power.|$|E
