25|$|French Canadians had {{continued}} to farm as they always had. By the 1850s, soil nutrients were becoming exhausted. Their farming methods were outdated. About this time the textile industry in New England experienced a boom. With living conditions so harsh, and <b>work</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to find even in the largest city, Montreal, emigration seemed the only option for many. As the first wave moved out in 1850's, word of mouth soon began to move larger crowds by the late 1870s. Mill owners hired these French immigrants to staff their mills more cheaply than American and Irish-born workers, who were themselves displaced.|$|E
25|$|Told {{partly in}} flashback, {{it is the}} story of Katie Morosky (Barbra Streisand) and Hubbell Gardiner (Robert Redford). Their {{differences}} are immense: she is a stridently vocal Marxist Jew with strong anti-war opinions, and he is a carefree WASP with no particular political bent. While attending the same college, she is drawn to him because of his boyish good looks and his natural writing skill, which she finds captivating, although he does not <b>work</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> at it. He is intrigued by her conviction and her determination to persuade others to take up social causes. Their attraction is evident, but neither of them acts upon it, and they lose touch after graduation.|$|E

Ge took the cold response to his <b>work</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard.</b> He wrote that a man should live by doing agricultural work, and the art should not be for sale. He bought a small khutor (farm) in Chernigov gubernia (currently Ukraine) and moved there. He became acquainted with Leo Tolstoy and became an enthusiastic follower of his philosophy.|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, Nash {{announced}} that the 2014–15 season would be his last. During the preseason, he experienced back pain, and further aggravated his back while lifting luggage. On October 23, {{less than a week}} before the start of what would have been the 40-year-old Nash's 19th year in the NBA, he was ruled out for the season due to a recurring back injury. Nash only played in three preseason games before he started to feel more pain in his back. Nash on injuring his back: [...] "Being on the court this season has been my top priority, and it is disappointing to {{not be able to do}} that right now. I <b>work</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to stay healthy, and unfortunately my recent setback makes performing at full capacity difficult. I will continue to support my team during this period of rest and will focus on my long-term health." ...|$|E

500|$|In his {{biography}} of Ranjitsinhji, Simon Wilde suggests that MacLaren had to <b>work</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> for his employer in this period, and found {{little time for}} cricket. In addition, his batting form was poor throughout, {{and he seemed to}} be in bad physical condition when he occasionally found time to play. Before Ranjitsinhji returned to India, MacLaren resigned as his secretary—although he went with him to India for a holiday. According to Wilde, the resignation was to allow MacLaren to play more regularly, but [...] "he never really recovered his form". In summarising Ranjitsinhji's life at this time, Wilde suggests that his unreliability with money was quite calculated, and writes: [...] "Many of his off-the-field exploits with A. C. MacLaren... will probably never be known, but it seems clear that sometimes they were not averse to conducting themselves in the fashion of E. W. Hornung's fictional character Raffles, the cricketing burglar." ...|$|E
500|$|Bachchan {{said that}} Sam was his most {{difficult}} character to play, {{and he worked}} hard on his gestures and mannerisms: [...] "I had to <b>work</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to portray a straight man acting gay. It could easily have gone over-board. I wanted to avoid making the character caricatural [...] Barring one portion ... we kept it controlled." [...] Bachchan and Abraham, who had gained weight for their earlier films, had to lose the weight and become more muscular. Although Chopra agreed to wear a swimsuit, she refused to wear a bikini. The actress said that {{that she did not}} lose any weight (as the media speculated), but worked out for a toned look in her films; she was also filming Fashion (2008) at the time. According to Chopra, [...] "For Fashion, I had to put on six kilos and later had to shed chip by chip as the character progressed in the film. My body structure in Dostana is more toned than in Fashion as it is a completely beach film. I've worked very hard on my body." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the podium}} ceremony, Schumacher, Coulthard and Berger did not spray the {{traditional}} champagne as {{a mark of}} respect to Senna. Schumacher felt lucky to win the race, conceding that [...] "Damon {{was a little bit}} quicker than me...he ended up going off and that's racing, but I don't think I could have caught him." [...] He also believed that his good start was fortunate, as it was the first one he had made in the new Benetton car; the team had not practised starts previously due to being short of time. He also specified his evasion of Barrichello's slowing car in the pit-lane entry while making his first stop as a crucial moment of the race. Coulthard admitted that he had been affected by his tonsillitis: [...] "I wasn't able to match Michael and Damon's pace so I settled for running my own race". Berger, meanwhile, was frustrated to finish a lap down on Schumacher, saying that [...] "He was faster everywhere: down the straights, {{going in and out of}} the corners. What can you do in these conditions? Okay, the car's roadholding is not bad. We must <b>work</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> now. But at least I finished, that's something." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2005, Pauline embarks on {{a romance}} {{with a new}} character, Joe Macer (Ray Brooks), whom she meets at salsa classes. A {{relationship}} develops, and despite her initial trepidation, Pauline remarries in 2006, after almost a decade alone. Pauline's marriage to Joe {{was an attempt to}} give the character a [...] "new lease of life", and her wedding day was screened to coincide with EastEnders 21st anniversary. Richard was openly opposed to her character remarrying, but she was eventually convinced by the executive producer and battled, successfully, for Pauline to keep the [...] "Fowler" [...] surname. However, in July 2006, Wendy Richard announced that she was leaving EastEnders; she quit due to [...] "creative differences" [...] with the show's producers regarding Pauline's remarriage, which she felt was [...] "disloyal" [...] to her character's beloved first husband, Arthur. According to an interview in The Sun, Richard commented, [...] "I think it's the most terrible shame, I really do. I thought in my heart of hearts it was wrong... I just couldn't believe that Pauline would remarry—anybody... I would have stayed a bit longer if Pauline hadn't got married." [...] Richard felt that she did not have the same chemistry with Ray Brooks, who played Joe, as she did with Bill Treacher, who played Arthur. She refuted producers' opinions that Pauline and Joe [...] "looked good together" [...] and felt that she and Brooks had to <b>work</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to turn them into a [...] "realistic-looking couple." ...|$|E

[...] Bloomberg pointed out at that countries such as Brazil, South Korea and Thailand sold their respective currencies in the weeks preceding the report to curb gains and support export. South Korea, Taiwan, Brazil, Colombia and Russia were also tightening rules to limit capital flows and avoid swings in their currencies.|$|E

Ewbank was brought in to oversee the Browns' linemen after backfield coach John Brickels quit to take a job at Miami University and tackles coach Bill Edwards left to become the head coach at Vanderbilt University. Ewbank expected to coach quarterbacks, having played the position in college, but Brown insisted that he oversee the tackles. [...] "He knew I'd have to <b>work</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> at this job and bring a fresh approach", Ewbank said many years later.|$|E

Moore's second collection, A Few Choice Words to the Public appeared in 1878, but found few buyers. Moore [...] gave a second public performance in late 1878 at the same opera house. By then she had figured out that the praise directed to her was false and the jeering sincere. She began by admitting her poetry was [...] "partly full of mistakes" [...] and that [...] "literary is a <b>work</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> to do".

[...] Fairless later recalled that his father repeatedly said {{the only way to}} survive in the world was to work and <b>work</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard.</b> His mother was seriously injured in a horse and buggy accident when he was two years old, and he was sent to live with his aunt and uncle, Sarah and Jacob Fairless, in nearby Justus, Ohio. His uncle ran a small grocery store from the front of his home. His relatives adopted him, and he took their last name. (He continued to maintain a home in Justus until the end of his life.) He began selling copies of the Cleveland Press at the age of five to raise money for his family. Fairless remained close to his mother and father, however. He described his father as a happy-go-lucky person who liked almost everyone, and who thought little of walking [...] on his day off to see his teenage son play baseball. His called his mother [...] "a truly great woman" [...] who had little education but who taught her children the values of honesty, thrift, hard work, and saving.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, {{together}} with Tam Harvey, Connolly started {{a group called}} the Humblebums. At their first gig, Connolly reportedly introduced them both to the audience by saying, [...] "My name's Billy Connolly, and I'm humble. This is Tam Harvey, he's a bum." [...] The band would later include Gerry Rafferty, who saw Connolly at a charity show in Paisley. [...] "Gerry was very good for me. He taught me that I would never be a musician as long as my arse looked south. He was just so outstandingly good and getting better, and although I was getting better too, the space between us remained huge. He was a real musician, he knew and felt music, a bass player, with a lovely sense of harmony, as well as a great guitarist. I knew tunes and how to play them but that was where my musicianship ended. Unfortunately, I’m still the same to this day. I <b>work</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard,</b> I play every day but I’m still ordinary. I can be flashy, but it’s all tricks really. He’s a musician and I’m just not in the same league. So, I gave up these ambitions and concentrated on what I was really born to do." [...] After Harvey left the group, Connolly and Rafferty continued as a duo and the latter two of their three albums featured just that duo. [...] Connolly sang, played five-string banjo, guitar, and autoharp, and at live shows entertained the audience with his humorous introductions to the songs.|$|E
