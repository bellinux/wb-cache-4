25|$|When {{he first}} arrived in Paris, he wrote home {{regularly}} to his mother, he sketched his nudes at the Académie Colarossi, and he drank wine in moderation. He {{was at that time}} considered by those who knew him as a bit reserved, verging on the asocial. He is noted to have commented, upon meeting Picasso who, at the time, <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> trademark workmen's clothes, that even though the man was a genius, that did not excuse his uncouth appearance.|$|E
25|$|Traylor {{joined the}} New England Patriots in 2004 {{and went on}} to start 10 of the 16 regular season games at nose tackle. He posted 33 tackles on the year and was part of a unit that ranked sixth in the NFL in rush defense, {{allowing}} an average of only 98.3 yards per game. He started each of the final ten regular season games and opened two of three postseason contests. He recorded two tackles in the playoffs, including one in Super Bowl XXXIX as the Patriots beat the Eagles and Traylor earned his third Super Bowl ring. He ended up wearing number 98 because his Patriots teammate Ty Warren <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> traditional number 94.|$|E

2500|$|Hobson {{had planned}} for the signing to occur on 7 February however {{on the morning of}} 6 February, 45 chiefs were waiting ready to sign. Around noon a ship {{carrying}} two officers from H.M.S Herald arrived and were surprised to hear they were waiting for the Governor so a boat was quickly despatched back to let him know. Although the official painting of the signing shows Hobson wearing full naval regalia, he was in fact not expecting the chiefs that day and <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> dressing gown or [...] "in plain clothes, except his hat". The treaty signing began in the afternoon.|$|E
2500|$|Steve William Stephens (December 10, 1979 – April 18, 2017) {{worked as}} a {{vocational}} specialist at Beech Brook, a behavioral health agency for children and families. He <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> work ID badge and repeatedly mentioned Beech Brook in multiple videos {{on the day of}} the murder. Police confirmed there was no known connection between Godwin and Stephens prior to the shooting and that Godwin was selected at random. [...] Stephens' mother was quoted as having told authorities that Stephens told her by phone he was [...] "shooting people" [...] because he was [...] "mad with his girlfriend" [...] of about three years, who was confirmed to be safe and was cooperating with investigators at the time.|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, {{he played}} President John F. Kennedy in {{an episode of}} the 1980s revival of The Twilight Zone, [...] "Profile in Silver". In 1988 he portrayed Liberace in a {{television}} biopic. With one of Robinson's acting trademarks being his effeminate voice, he was well suited for the part. Robinson had described {{it as one of}} his favorite roles and that [...] "The most fun <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> furs and jewelry and singing 'I'll be Seeing You.'" [...] The New York Times reviewer noted that [...] "Robinson does rather well in the leading role." [...] He returned to the stage in 1993 with a Broadway production of Frank Gilroy's Any Given Day, but the play closed after only six weeks.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{suffered}} further line-up {{changes during}} this period, with Dewey Rowell leaving the band in 1991 {{and not being}} replaced until 1992 by Pete Lee, after the recording of America Must Be Destroyed. During this period, Gwar was (temporarily) banned in North Carolina because Brockie <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> [...] "Cuttlefish of Cthulhu" [...] codpiece, which led to his arrest; this incident was the inspiration for Gwar's third album, America Must Be Destroyed, released in 1992. The album was accompanied by the movie Phallus in Wonderland, which documented the main concept and contained music videos for the album. Phallus in Wonderland {{was nominated for a}} Grammy Award in 1993. After recording for This Toilet Earth was completed, bassist Mike Bishop left the band. He was replaced by Casey Orr, from the band Rigor Mortis.|$|E
2500|$|There, Guevara, who <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> {{arm in a}} sling {{after falling}} off a wall during the {{fighting}} in Caibarién, divided his forces (numbering about 300) into two columns. The southern column {{was the first to}} meet the defending army forces commanded by Colonel Casillas Lumpuy. An armored train, sent by Batista to reinforce supplies of ammunition, weapons and other equipment, traveled along {{to the foot of the}} hill of Capiro, northeast of the city, establishing a command post there. Guevara dispatched his [...] "suicide squad", a force under 23-year-old Roberto Rodríguez (known as [...] "El Vaquerito"), to capture the hill. The defenders of the hill withdrew with surprising speed and the train, containing officers and soldiers from the command post, withdrew towards the middle of the town.|$|E
2500|$|While {{there had}} been {{previous}} cases where police officers confused guns with Tasers, modern Tasers weigh {{half as much as}} handguns. [...] The prosecution argued that the position of Mehserle's Taser [...] "in relation to his duty weapon, combined with the different 'feel' and color of the two weapons made it highly unlikely that he would have mistaken one for the other." [...] Burris responded to claims of Taser confusion by arguing that video evidence did not support the idea of Taser confusion. In any event, he said, Mehserle had no reason to fire his Taser. Mehserle <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> Taser {{on the left side of}} his body (on the opposite side from which he wore his gun) – but set up for a cross-body, strong hand (right-hand) draw.|$|E

2500|$|Speed {{moved over}} to Melling Racing team for the 1995 season and resurrected the organization. [...] The {{normally}} red and white Melling car now was embazoned with Spam sponsorship and blue and yellow colors. Speed had two top ten runs, at Charlotte in the Coca Cola 600 and at Darlington in the Southern 500 to finish twenty-third in the points rundown. However, the 1995 season provided Speed with what is perhaps his most famous moment. After the Miller Genuine Draft 400, Michael Waltrip blocked Speed's car in the pits. Waltrip, angry with Speed for blocking him on the track, pulled down Speed's window net and began throwing punches at Speed, who <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> helmet. The incident was broadcast {{in front of a}} live television audience on the CBS network and resulted in a $10,000 fine for Waltrip.|$|E
2500|$|The 8th Virginia Regiment {{was raised}} {{beginning}} on 11 January 1776 for service with the Virginia State Troops. The unit's first commanding officer was patriot leader and pastor Peter Muhlenberg, {{who became a}} militia colonel in 1775 {{at the request of}} Washington. In his last sermon from the pulpit, Muhlenberg read from Ecclesiastes 3:1, [...] "There is a time for all things, a time to preach and a time to pray; {{but there is also a}} time to fight, and that time has now come." [...] He removed his clerical robes to show that he <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> uniform as a militia colonel. He quickly enlisted 300 men from his congregation in the unit that became the 8th Virginia. Muhlenberg was appointed colonel on 1 March 1776. The 8th Virginia organized at Suffolk County Court House between 9 February and 4 April 1776. The unit's 10 companies came from Augusta, Berkeley, Culpeper, Dunmore, Fincastle, Frederick, and Hampshire Counties, plus the District of West Augusta. On 25 May 1776 the regiment officially became part of the Continental Army. Aside from Colonel Muhlenberg, the unit's field officers were Lieutenant Colonel Abraham Bowman and Major Peter Helphenstine.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 August 1975, McConnell was alleged by Weir to {{have been}} part of a UVF group that ambushed two Gaelic {{football}} supporters at a bogus vehicle checkpoint set up in the Cortamlet Road at the townland of Altnamachin, near Tullyvallen close to the Irish Republic border. At about 11.30 pm, Colm McCartney (aged 22) and Sean Farmer (aged 32), both from Derry, were returning home from the Derry versus Dublin All-Ireland semi-final football match at Croke Park in Dublin when the group stopped the car they were travelling in. Upon their discovery that the two men inside were Catholics, the UVF gunmen ordered them {{out of the car and}} a short distance away turned their guns on Farmer, killing him instantly. McCartney attempted to escape on foot, but his pursuers caught up with him and he was also fatally gunned down. McCartney and Farmer had been shot four times and six times respectively. McConnell <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>his</b> British Army uniform at the time the attack occurred. A local resident who had been in the vicinity walking his dog saw the stopped vehicle; he then heard the sounds of gunfire, someone running along the road, a male voice shouting [...] "stop, stop", which was then followed by [...] "wild screaming" [...] and another series of gunshots. He also saw another car drive away from the scene afterwards. Less than an hour before the shootings, a three-man RUC patrol in an unmarked car had been stopped by the same UVF unit after one soldier had waved a red torch in a circular motion indicating that it was a military vehicle checkpoint. Another soldier was lying in a ditch with a rifle. The RUC immediately suspected that it was a bogus checkpoint despite the men having worn full military combat uniforms. After the RUC men were passed through the checkpoint, they requested by radio, clarification as to whether there were any authorised regular Army or UDR checkpoints in the area that night, and received the confirmation that there were none. Although the RUC patrol reported the unauthorised checkpoint to the Army and requested their help in investigating the incident, no action had been taken. The killings were claimed by the Protestant Action Force, one of the cover names used by the Glenanne gang. The fake vehicle checkpoint manned UVF men in full British Army uniform was the same modus operandi which the UVF had employed when they waylaid the Miami Showbanda popular Irish cabaret bandthe previous month at Buskhill, County Down; however, McConnell was not implicated in that incident.|$|E
