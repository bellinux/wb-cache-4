5|$|Tiberius's move thus {{seemed to}} be an interim solution: he would hold power only until his stepsons would come of age, and then be swept aside. The promiscuous, and very public, {{behavior}} of his unhappily married wife, Julia, may have also played a part.

Tiberius had found himself married to a <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> loathed, who publicly humiliated him with nighttime escapades in the Forum, and forbidden to see the <b>woman</b> <b>he</b> had loved.|$|E
