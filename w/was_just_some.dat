25|$|Soon, the Train was put {{in charge}} of the landing's water supply, {{something}} that had been neglected during the early stage of the campaign. As there was no supply available, water had to be brought by sea, often in petrol tins. This responsibility was given to the Train on 12 August, they were able to source three fire engines and some hoses, which, with the Train's pontoons were used to pump supplies brought from transport ships to tanks on the beach. The fire hoses were kept under guard, and eventually replaced with metal pipe as soldiers would constantly make holes in it to get at the water inside. This <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>some</b> of the work that saw the Train removed from the 11th Division and directly attached to the IX Corps Engineers, becoming responsible for all work afloat or on the beach up to the high-water mark that the Navy might require.|$|E
500|$|According to Hankinson, [...] "One of {{the best}} parts of the episode {{centered}} around Brittany and Santana, but I think all the principals—Artie, Finn, Rachel, and Quinn too—did a great job portraying the tension and distrust pervading the team." [...] Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times felt the show was [...] "absurdly preachy" [...] on the matter of rumors, though he said the episode was [...] "decent". The scene in the motel room with Sam, Rachel, Finn and Sam's brother and sister was called [...] "arguably the most affecting scene of the entire episode" [...] by Handlen, and Poniewozik wrote that [...] "Chord Overstreet sold Sam's feeling of loss". Canning felt otherwise: [...] "It may have had a better impact if we cared more about Sam or if Chord Overstreet had delivered more believable tears, but as things were, it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>some</b> ordinary, blah drama." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Beck {{had been}} {{impressed}} with the Chess studio's history and sound, he {{had been unable to}} complete a guitar solo to his satisfaction. [...] "I kept changing guitar sounds all the way through. So we did two or three takes of my guitars and blended them all together. But the solo on [...] "Shapes of Things" [...] was pretty honest up until that feedback note that comes in over it", he recalled. [...] During the recording, [...] "there was mass hysteria in the studio when I did that solo. [...] They weren't expecting it and it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>some</b> weird mist coming from the East out of an amp. [...] Giorgio was freaking out and dancing about like some tribal witch doctor". [...] Beck played the solo on one string(G), using a 1954 Fender Esquire guitar he had purchased before the tour. Relf also benefitted from multi-tracking—two vocal tracks were recorded, allowing him to harmonise the vocal line.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles were {{scheduled}} to fly to India to visit the Maharishi {{for two or three}} months of Transcendental Meditation. Before they left, Cynthia found letters from Yoko Ono to Lennon which indicated he had had contact with her over a period of some time. Lennon denied he was involved with Ono, explaining that she <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>some</b> [...] "crazy artist" [...] who wanted to be sponsored, although Ono kept up a stream of telephone calls and visits to Kenwood. On 15 February 1968, the Lennons flew to India, followed by the other Beatles and their partners four days later: Boyd, Asher, and Maureen Starkey (Starr's wife). The division between the sexes was emphasised by the male musicians sitting outside at night composing songs, while their partners gathered together in one of their rooms, often talking about life as the wife or partner of a Beatle. [...] The Lennons shared a four-poster bed at the ashram, with Lennon playing guitar and Cynthia drawing and writing poetry between their long sessions of meditation.|$|E

The front bumper was changed giving it a wide lower grille and the foglights were bulged out at the side (cars not equipped with foglights remained using the older ph2 bumper), the upper grille was changed and the headlights (which previously had black background) now had grey. The 15" [...] alloy wheels were changed and were now a 15" [...] version of the facelift 172 model on Dynamique and Extreme models. Clear side repeaters were added, as was a colourcoded rear spoiler (again on Dynamique spec cars). In the South American market, the facelifted Clio continued to use the dashboard of the 1998 model and was never updated, except for the Colombian 2008 model that included the same interior of the European version with little changes, and continued having the same exterior as the phase II model.|$|E
