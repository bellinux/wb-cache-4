5|$|During the 12th century major landowners {{tended to}} rent out their demesne lands for money, {{motivated}} by static prices for produce and {{the chaos of}} the Anarchy between 1135 and 1153. This practice began to alter in the 1180s and 1190s, spurred by the greater political stability. In the first years of John's reign, agricultural prices almost doubled, at once increasing the potential profits on the demesne estates and also increasing the cost of living for the landowners themselves. Landowners now attempted <b>wherever</b> <b>possible</b> to bring their demesne lands back into direct management, creating a system of administrators and officials to run their new system of estates.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1950s, the Manchester City manager Les McDowall {{introduced}} a new tactical system using a deep-lying centre-forward, which {{became known as the}} Revie Plan after Don Revie who played centre-forward. The system depended on maintaining possession of the ball <b>wherever</b> <b>possible,</b> which required Trautmann to make use of his throwing ability. For goalkeepers of Trautmann's era, it was usual to kick the ball as far as possible downfield after making a save. By contrast, Trautmann, influenced by the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics, sought to start attacks by throwing the ball to a wing-half, typically Ken Barnes or John McTavish. The wing-half then passed to Revie to develop the attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{conservation}} {{was carried}} out between 1974 and 1986, <b>wherever</b> <b>possible</b> using non-invasive procedures such as washing with water and a solution of lime, filling gaps and damaged surfaces with soft mortar to prevent the ingress of water and stabilising statues that were fracturing because of the corrosion of metal dowels. The surfaces were finished by painting with a thin coat of mortar and silane to resist further erosion and attack by pollutants. The restoration of the fa√ßade revealed much paint adhering to the statues and their niches, indicating that it had once been brightly coloured.|$|E
5|$|The restorers {{washed the}} {{surfaces}} {{using a variety}} of solvents. Distilled water was used <b>wherever</b> <b>possible</b> to remove soot and dissolve water-soluble gums. Retouching and repainting that had been part of previous later restorations were removed with a gelatinous solvent, applied in several stages for measured times, and washed with distilled water. Salt efflorescences of calcium carbonate were treated by the application of a solution of dimethylformamide. The final step was the application of a weak solution of acrylic polymer to consolidate and protect the surface, and further washing.|$|E

In the traditional system of transhumance, people and livestock moved seasonally between fixed summer and winter pastures; in montane regions the summer pasture was up in the mountains, the winter pasture in the valleys.|$|E
5|$|When {{production}} of Aspirin began in 1899, Bayer sent out small packets {{of the drug}} to doctors, pharmacists and hospitals, advising them of Aspirin's uses and encouraging them to publish about the drug's effects and effectiveness. As positive results came in and enthusiasm grew, Bayer sought to secure patent and trademark <b>wherever</b> <b>possible.</b> It was ineligible for patent in Germany (despite being accepted briefly before the decision was overturned), but Aspirin was patented in Britain (filed 22 December 1898) and the United States (US Patent 644,077 issued 27 February 1900). The British patent was overturned in 1905, the American patent was also besieged but was ultimately upheld.|$|E

5|$|For the dentist, {{the goal}} of {{treatment}} generally is to relieve the pain, and <b>wherever</b> <b>possible</b> to preserve or restore function. The treatment depends on {{the cause of the}} toothache, and frequently a clinical decision regarding the current state and long-term prognosis of the affected tooth, as well as the individual's wishes and ability to cope with dental treatment, will influence the treatment choice. Often, administration of an intra-oral local anesthetic such as lidocaine and epinephrine is indicated in order to carry out pain-free treatment. Treatment may range from simple advice, removal of dental decay with a dental drill and subsequent placement of a filling, to root canal treatment, tooth extraction, or debridement.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn's {{interest}} in baroque music {{was not limited}} to the Bach St Matthew Passion which he had revived in 1829. He was concerned in preparing and editing such music, whether for performance or for publication, to be {{as close as possible to}} the original intentions of the composers, including <b>wherever</b> <b>possible</b> a close study of early editions and manuscripts. This could lead him into conflict with publishers; for instance, his edition of Handel's oratorio Israel in Egypt for the London Handel Society (1845) evoked an often contentious correspondence, with Mendelssohn refusing for example to add dynamics where not given by Handel, or to add parts for trombones. Mendelssohn also edited a number of Bach's works for organ, and apparently discussed with Robert Schumann the possibility of producing a complete Bach edition.|$|E

5|$|The bailey was an {{enclosed}} courtyard overlooked by the motte {{and surrounded by}} a wooden fence called a palisade and another ditch. The bailey was often kidney-shaped to fit against a circular motte, but could be made in other shapes according to the terrain. The bailey would contain a wide number of buildings, including a hall, kitchens, a chapel, barracks, stores, stables, forges or workshops, and was {{the centre of the}} castle's economic activity. The bailey was linked to the motte either by a flying bridge stretching between the two, or, more popularly in England, by steps cut into the motte. Typically the ditch of the motte and the bailey joined, forming a figure of eight around the castle. <b>Wherever</b> <b>possible,</b> nearby streams and rivers would be dammed or diverted, creating water-filled moats, artificial lakes and other forms of water defences.|$|E

Against Stringer's advice, Avon decides to take Marlo's territory by force and the two gangs become embroiled in a bitter turf war with multiple deaths. Omar Little continues to rob the Barksdale organization <b>wherever</b> <b>possible.</b> Working with his new boyfriend Dante and two women, he is once more a serious problem.
