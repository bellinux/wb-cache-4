40|$|Increasingly, {{composite}} materials {{are being used}} in advanced structural applications because of the significant weight savings they offer when compared to more traditional engineering materials.

At present, there is considerable interest in fabricating solid rocket motor cases out of {{composite materials}}, and capitalizing on the reduced structural weight to increase rocket performance. However, one of the difficulties that arises when composite materials are used is that composites can develop significant amounts of internal damage during low velocity impacts. Such low velocity impacts may be encountered in routine handling of a structural component like a rocket motor case. The ability to assess the reduction in structural integrity of composite motor cases that experience accidental impacts is essential if composite rocket motor cases are to be certified for manned flight.

The basis of this technology includes winding of resin-impregnated fibers into a tool and hardening of the wound structure. This technology enables the fibers to be placed into the direction of the load that may be expected during exploitation of construction elements.
