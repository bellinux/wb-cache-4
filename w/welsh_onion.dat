2500|$|In Japan, {{chicken soup}} {{is known as}} torijiru. [...] Typically it starts with dashi, which is made from boiling konbu (kelp) and katsuobushi (dried {{skipjack}} tuna flakes), and not by boiling the chicken (whole chicken is not typically available in Japanese supermarkets). After the dashi is prepared, pieces of boneless chicken thigh meat are usually used and combined with vegetables like daikon radish, carrot, burdock, konnyaku, <b>welsh</b> <b>onion,</b> mushrooms, potatoes, and taro root. At the end, different seasonings are added depending on {{the region of the}} country or type of soup. It could be a miso-based soup or soy sauce-based. Cooking sake, mirin, salt, and vinegar are also used with the soy sauce or miso. The pork equivalent called butajiru is more popular than the chicken-based soup.|$|E
2500|$|The {{software}} {{became very}} popular in Japan upon the release of Crypton Future Media's Hatsune Miku Vocaloid 2 software and her success {{has led to the}} popularity of the Vocaloid software in general. Japanese video sharing website Niconico played a fundamental role in the recognition and popularity of the software. A user of Hatsune Miku and an illustrator released a much-viewed video, in which [...] "Hachune Miku", a super deformed Miku, held a <b>Welsh</b> <b>onion</b> (Negi in Japanese), which resembles a leek, and sang the Finnish song [...] "Ievan Polkka" [...] like the flash animation [...] "Loituma Girl", on Nico Nico Douga. According to Crypton, they knew that users of Nico Nico Douga had started posting videos with songs created by the software before Hatsune Miku, but the video presented multifarious possibilities of applying the software in multimedia content creation—notably the dōjin culture. As the recognition and popularity of the software grew, Nico Nico Douga became a place for collaborative content creation. Popular original songs written by a user would generate illustrations, animation in 2D and 3D, and remixes by other users. Other creators would show their unfinished work and ask for ideas. The software has also been used to tell stories using song and verse and the Story of Evil series has become so popular that a manga, six books, and two theatre works were produced by the series creator. Another theater production based on [...] "Cantarella", a song sung by Kaito and produced by Kurousa-P, was also set to hit the stage and will run Shibuya's Space Zero theater in Tokyo from August 3 to August 7, 2011. The website has become so influential that studios often post demos on Nico Nico Douga, as well as other websites such as YouTube, as part of the promotional effort of their Vocaloid products. The important role Nico Nico Douga has played in promoting the Vocaloids also sparked interest in the software and Kentaro Miura, the artist of Gakupo's mascot design, had offered his services for free because of his love for the website.|$|E

40|$|Japan {{has been}} one of the major GATT/WTO member {{countries}} with relatively little experience in implementing protectionist measures. However, in April 2001, for the first time in its history, Japan invoked provisional safeguard measures against imports of <b>Welsh</b> <b>onions,</b> Shiitake mushrooms and Tatami mats mainly from China. This paper reviews and evaluates the chain of events regarding these safeguard actions, and considers the means by which Japan might be able to deal with its 'trilemma' policy problem involving how to coordinate the promotion of trade liberalisation, the administration of WTO-consistent safeguards and responses to domestic political demands for protection. The paper first attempts to review the theoretical rationale for implementing safeguard measures and counterarguments against these measures. Second, it discusses the economic circumstances in which Japan implemented the safeguard measures and evaluates these measures critically from the standpoint of economic efficiency and the political economy interests involved. Finally, it concludes with a recommendation that the aforementioned 'trilemma' policy problem in Japan can be best addressed by means of the introduction of a 'well-institutionalised' domestic programme to provide adjustment assistance to ameliorate the displacement resulting from import surges.

50|$|Asparagus rust {{is found}} {{worldwide}} wherever garden asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) is grown. As with many crop diseases, rust disease caused by Puccinia asparagi spreads rapidly due to poor field maintenance and close proximity of crop fields - asparagus rust was enabled to establish itself from New Jersey to California in five years. The disease {{has long been}} known in Europe, but did not attain prominence in the United States until 1902. Since then, the rust has spread to every important asparagus-growing region in the United States. Even in areas with climate ill suited to support vegetation, such as the Imperial Valley of California, have reported severe rust damage, with many crop fields having 100% infection rate. Puccinia asparagi also attacks a number of nonedible species of asparagus, including A. brouseopetii, A. caspius, A. maritimus, A. medeoloides, asparagus fern (A. plumosus), and A. verticillatus. It has also been observed to attack the common <b>onion,</b> <b>Welsh</b> or Spanish <b>onion,</b> chives, and shallot.|$|R
