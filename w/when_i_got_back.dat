500|$|Oppong debuted {{and made}} his first start for the Eastern Kentucky Colonels in their season opener on November 14, 2008, against Florida International. He led his team in both rebounds and blocks. In the {{following}} week, he was named Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) Newcomer of the Week. In a win over Ball State on December 13, he recorded 11 points and a season-high 9 rebounds. However, on December 20, he separated his left shoulder after grabbing a team-high 8 rebounds vs Cincinnati. It was estimated by head coach Jeff Neubauer that he would miss a few weeks due to a torn labrum. Oppong was absent for the Colonels' five next games. He recalled the moment saying, [...] "Cincinnati {{was one of our}} best games, but for me, I really don't like that game. It was when I actually dislocated my shoulder. And it hurt—it really hurt. The process of coming back was so hard because it took so long. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back,</b> it took me a minute {{to get back into the}} flow and get adjusted." [...] Oppong return on January 15, 2009, against Eastern Illinois, and did not make another start that season until a loss to Morehead State at the 2009 Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. Through the whole season, Oppong averaged 9.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 1.2 assists. He was one of Eastern Kentucky's rebounding leaders.|$|E
500|$|During Brain's {{tenure at}} de Havilland, the company {{manufactured}} sixty-nine Vampire T35 jet trainers at its Bankstown factory for delivery to the RAAF, {{as well as}} Sea Venoms for the RAN. Leaving deHavilland upon its merger with Hawker Siddeley in 1960, he gave up full-time work and joined the board of East-West Airlines as a consultant in January 1961. In August 1964, he began negotiations with the Federal government on behalf of International Parcels Express Company (now Toll IPEC), which was attempting to enter the air freight business in Australia with the purchase of five DC-4 Skymasters; the government rejected the proposal later that year. Along with Arthur Coles, Brain was a guest {{at the opening of}} TAA's new headquarters at Franklin Street, Melbourne in November 1965. In 1978, he met with adventurer Dick Smith, who was about to launch an expedition to recover the Kookaburra from the Tanami Desert. Smith was keen to get directions from the man who had found the missing plane in 1929, in spite of receiving advice against taking the word of someone from the [...] "cap and goggles" [...] era. He rediscovered the Kookaburra in August that year [...] "exactly where Lester Brain had said...Lester was completely chuffed <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> and told him I'd found the Kookaburra thanks to his directions and how thankful I was that, despite everyone else's suggestions, I'd taken Lester's advice." ...|$|E

2500|$|John Snow (4/143) gave Australia a torrid start, sending Bill Lawry and Keith Stackpole {{back to the}} {{pavilion}} with 8 runs on the board, the batsmen having already survived lbw appeals from Ken Shuttleworth and Peter Lever. Lever then had Doug Walters caught behind by Alan Knott to make it 17/3. Ian Chappell (50) and Ian Redpath saw out the day and added 88 before they were parted, but Paul Sheahan was run out for 2 and Greg Chappell came in at 107/5. In 1968 a 21-year-old Chappell had batted for Somerset, but when they played Sussex at Hove he was cracked on {{the head by a}} nasty bouncer from Snow and forced to retire hurt. He was therefore under no illusions as to his likely reception from the fiery fast bowler in the Test arena. Redpath made his highest Test score of 171 before he was [...] Chappell spent 40 minutes making 1, but after tea he hit 58 runs inside an hour to bring up his maiden Test century, 108 in his first Test innings as they put on 219 for the sixth wicket. He was the eleventh Australian to make a century on his Ashes debut after Charles Bannerman, Harry Graham, Reggie Duff, Roger Hartigan, Herbie Collins, Bill Ponsford, Archie Jackson, Neil Harvey, Jim Burke and Doug Walters. He gave Brian Luckhurst a catch off Ken Shuttleworth, but [...] "Bill Lawry didn't go crook on me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> into the rooms, so I guess it didn't matter". Rod Marsh added 40 and Australia overtook England's total with seven wickets down and ended with 440, a lead of 43.|$|E

500|$|... "Friends Forever/What's Going to Happen" [...] was {{composed}} by Fordham, Marx and Lopez. [...] "Friends Forever" [...] is {{a parody of}} 1950s-style musical numbers in general, and [...] "We Go Together" [...] from Grease in particular. However, {{this was not the}} original plan. According to Fordham, [...] "I was really shocked <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the demo <b>back,</b> because I had never envisioned a '50s number.

Queer enough they were. Is there a human being that isn't that--more or less secretly? But whatever their secret, it was manifest {{to me that it}} was neither subtle nor profound. They were a good, stupid, earnest couple and very much bothered. They were that--with the usual unshaded crudity of average people.

5000|$|Lee {{never gave}} Colan a full script for {{an issue of}} Daredevil; instead, he would tell him the plot, and Colan would tape record the {{conversation}} to refer to while drawing the issue, leaving Lee to add the script in afterwards. Though Colan is consistently credited as penciler only, Lee would typically give him the freedom to fill in details of the plot as he saw fit. Lee explained [...] "If I would tell Gene who the villain was and what the problem was, how the problem should be resolved and where it would take place, Gene could fill in all the details. Which made it very interesting for me to write because <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the artwork <b>back</b> and had {{to put in the}} copy, I was seeing things that I'd not expected." [...] The 31-issue Lee/Colan run on the series included Daredevil #47, in which Murdock defends a blind Vietnam veteran against a frameup; Lee has cited it as the story he is most proud of out of his entire career. With issue #51, Lee turned the writing chores over to Roy Thomas (who succeeded him on a number of Marvel's titles), but would remain on board as editor for another 40 issues.|$|R
