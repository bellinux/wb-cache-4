Inspired by the exposition by Chan, Roschelle, Hsi, Kinshuk, Sharples, Brown, et al. (2006) on the seamless learning model supported by the setting {{of one or more}} mobile device per learner, this paper aims to further investigate the meaning of seamless learning and the potential <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in practice. Through a thorough review of recent academic papers on mobile-assisted seamless learning (MSL), we identify ten dimensions that characterize MSL. We believe that such a framework allows us to identify research gaps in the stated area. A practitioner interested in adopting a MSL design or doing a new design can use our analysis to situate the dimensional space where the constraints or parameters of his or her design problem lie, and look at relevant design and research-based evidence of other related MSL systems to refine her own design...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to explore the}} problems surrounding the human rights that are usually regarded as the moral foundation of modern society. The values incorporated in these {{human rights and the}} legal problems concerning their validity raise many questions. To achieve an insight into these problems, this study regards human rights as a product of the Western development of the law. The primary concern here is the importance of this development and <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into perspective, not by comparing it with other law cultures, but by exploring the immanent dynamics of the Western development itself. For this purpose, the study primarily regards the Western history (of law) as a history of consciousness. The tertium comparationes for the description of this development is the concept of human individuality. The issue of equality of rights is used as the example that gives this study a concrete focus. The problems surrounding equality of rights may be understood as fundamental to the understanding and functioning of the law and at the same time—because of the existing uncertainty about the meaning of equality as a legal principle—as a starting-point for putting Western legal consciousness into perspective. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} the Volga sterlet and grass frog. The object of {{investigation is}} revelation of the mechanisms of the effect produced by thee nonapeptidergic hypothalamo-hypophysial neurosecretory system on the functional activity of the thyroid gland in the puberal representatives of two classes of vertebrates existing at different levels of phylogenetic development. The researchers have pioneered in disclosing the possibility of influencing the thyroid gland by nonapeptide neurohormones in different <b>ways.</b> <b>To</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> otherwise, vasotocin may directly phyrogenetically influence the thyroid gland in an older way and mesotocin in a younger way via the anterior lobe of the hypophysis. It has been flund that in inferior vertebrates there exists feedback between the thyroid gland and vasotocinergic cells of the hypothalamus. The obtained data on the specific effect produced by nonapeptide neurohormones on the thyroid gland give a more profound notion of the mechanisms of neuroendocrinic regulation of the hyroid gland functions in phylogenesis and may find application in clinical practice and agriculture. The obtained results are now being employed in the lecture course at the biological department of the St. -Petersburg State Pedagogical University and may find application in the sphere of evolutionary physiology, physiology of the thyroid gland, endocrinology and neuroendocrinologyAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

6000|$|What {{is it to}} exclude? Why, it is {{to drive}} it out. It is in some <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> out of the Territory.

[...] "There's no <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> Sedna where <b>it</b> is.

40|$|It is with immense {{pleasure}} that I present {{to you this}} special issue of the L 2 Journal on “Symbolic Competence: From theory to pedagogic practice,” guest edited by William Heidenfeldt and Kimberly Vinall. This special issue has been a magnificent labor of love. When, in preparation for my retirement from UC Berkeley in April 2015, the Berkeley Language Center community contemplated putting together a Festschrift in my honor, my colleagues, my graduate students and I agreed that a conference would be a much better idea - one that reflected more appropriately the intense intellectual exchanges we had had together over the years. That conference titled “ClaireFest” took place on 17 - 18 April 2015 in Dwinelle Hall. It offered a host of exciting scholarly papers, moving testimonies of professional teachers, and heart-warming stories of experience. But {{the idea of having}} something in print to commemorate the event remained. Thanks to Rick Kern, the director of the BLC, {{the idea of having a}} special issue of the L 2 Journal dedicated to Claire Kramsch’s concept of symbolic competence started to take shape. Billy and Kimberly, who were finishing their PhD dissertations at the time (Heidenfeldt, 2015 a; Vinall 2015), eagerly picked up the challenge. Kimberly had already published two articles on the application of symbolic competence in her Spanish classes (Vinall, 2012, 2016); Billy had published an article on one Spanish teacher with a particularly high degree of symbolic competence (Heidenfeldt, 2015 b). Both had been seduced by the concept proposed by Claire in 2006, but were still looking for various <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in practice in the classroom. Their Call for Papers met with widespread enthusiasm and they had a large number of abstracts to choose from. Framed by an enlightening Introduction and a thought-provoking Afterword, the four papers presented here constitute an honest appraisal of the notion of symbolic competence and its practical applications in the language classroom. I wish to extend to Billy and Kimberly my most heartfelt thanks for having undertaken this demanding project, despite heavy teaching loads at their respective institutions. They have definitely clarified my initially attractive, but elusive brainchild, and given it a concrete and practical meaning. I hope that our readers find this special issue useful for both their research and their teaching practice, and that they are encouraged to further explore how symbolic competence can enrich the teaching and learning of foreign languages...|$|R
