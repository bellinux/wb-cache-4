25|$|A {{great many}} individuals, {{ever since the}} rise of the {{mathematical}} method, have, each for himself, attacked its direct and indirect consequences. I shall call each of these persons a paradoxer, and his system a paradox. I use the word in the old sense: a paradox is something which is apart from general opinion, either in subject matter, method, or conclusion. Many of the things brought forward would now be called crotchets, which is the nearest <b>word</b> <b>we</b> have to old paradox. But there is this difference, that by calling a thing a crotchet we mean to speak lightly of it; which was not the necessary sense of paradox. Thus in the 16th century many spoke of the earth's motion as the paradox of Copernicus and held the ingenuity of that theory in very high esteem, and some I think who even inclined towards it. In the seventeenth century the deprivation of meaning took place, in England at least.|$|E

500|$|Nude {{dancing at}} the club began in 1985 after a judge {{overturned}} City of Portland ordinances banning it at venues which served alcohol. A lawsuit over pasties and G-strings was brought after Portland annexed land formerly regulated by Multnomah County, which allowed tavern dancers to perform without clothing. A bar forced by the annexation to eliminate its nude dancing successfully sued the city. [...] "As soon as we got the <b>word</b> , <b>we</b> went nude," [...] said a club employee who was quoted in The Oregonian.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{language}} in the episode, Parker has said that they [...] "felt the pressure {{to live up to}} Spirit of Christmas", which contains a lot of obscenities, and as a result, they [...] "tried to push things... maybe further than we should". In particular, Parker said that they felt the need [...] "to put in dildo and every <b>word</b> <b>we</b> can get away with." [...] In contrast, they allowed subsequent episodes to [...] "be more natural", saying that those episodes are [...] "more about bizarre happenings and making fun of things that are taboo", [...] "without just throwing a bunch of dirty words in there." ...|$|E
500|$|... "We Are the World" [...] is sung from a {{first person}} viewpoint, {{allowing}} {{the audience to}} [...] "internalize" [...] the message by singing the <b>word</b> <b>we</b> together. It {{has been described as}} [...] "an appeal to human compassion". The first lines in the song's repetitive chorus proclaim, [...] "We are the world, we are the children, we are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start giving". [...] "We Are the World" [...] opens with Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Kenny Rogers, James Ingram, Tina Turner and Billy Joel singing the first verse. Michael Jackson and Diana Ross follow, completing the first chorus together. Dionne Warwick, Willie Nelson and Al Jarreau sing the second verse, before Bruce Springsteen, Kenny Loggins, Steve Perry and Daryl Hall go through the second chorus. Co-writer Jackson, Huey Lewis, Cyndi Lauper and Kim Carnes follow with the song's bridge. This structuring of the song is said to [...] "create a sense of continuous surprise and emotional buildup". [...] "We Are the World" [...] concludes with Bob Dylan and Ray Charles singing a full chorus, Wonder and Springsteen duetting, and ad libs from Charles and Ingram.|$|E

In an interview with MTV News, Lovato said that it [...] "really describes the show. I'm excited about that." [...] Speaking of the video, co-director Malloy said, [...] "The idea for the video is to create this hyperreal world, that's the <b>word</b> <b>we</b> keep using, La La Land. Fame has definitely gotten to everybody's head. It's more like [...] {{is the only one}} in this world that fame hasn't gotten to." [...] According to Lovato, her Sonny with a Chance co-stars play [...] "stereotypical Hollywood Los Angeles [...] big type of people." [...] The video premiered on December 19, 2008 on Disney Channel. It was released to the iTunes Store on January 20, 2009. For the video, the lyric [...] "I still eat McDonald's" [...] was changed to [...] "I still eat at Ronald's". Jefferson Reid of E! Online praised the video, writing, [...] "Mocking Hollywood phonies is always cool by us, and bonus points to Demi Lovato for doing it while rocking out in admirable form. Skewering the [...] "La La Land" [...] machine with sass and grit, Disney's latest everygirl rock star seems like she might eventually give Miley Cyrus a real run for her money." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Jean, Jackson {{would not}} {{commit to the}} episode until after a {{read-through}} of the script was done. The read was held at Jackson's manager Sandy Gallin's house, and Dan Castellaneta (who provides the voice for Homer) was 30 minutes late. Jean recalls that [...] "no one said a <b>word,</b> <b>we</b> just sat there waiting". Following the read, Jackson stipulated his conditions: he would record his speaking parts but not receive credit, and his singing voice would be performed by a sound-alike. Leon Kompowsky's singing parts were performed by Kipp Lennon, because Jackson wanted to play a joke on his brothers and fool them into thinking the impersonator was him. Lennon recorded his lines {{at the same time}} as Jackson, who found the impersonations humorous. Jackson showed up for the recording session alone and did not use the special trailer that was set up for him. According to Jean, Jackson did record versions of the singing parts, and while there have been rumors that those parts were the ones used in the final episode, The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma has stated the Lennon versions were used. Kompowsky's normal speaking voice, which is heard at the end of the episode, was recorded by cast member Hank Azaria. The episode originally was supposed to end with Kompowsky singing a portion of [...] "Man in the Mirror" [...] in his Michael Jackson voice as he walked down the road, but it was changed to him singing the beginning of [...] "Happy Birthday Lisa".|$|E

2500|$|As a {{consequence}} of his monistic philosophy, Schopenhauer was {{very concerned about the}} welfare of animals. For him, all individual animals, including humans, are essentially the same, being phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying Will. The word [...] "will" [...] designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest <b>word</b> <b>we</b> have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience. Since every living thing possesses will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other. For this reason, he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals, who are our fellow sufferers.|$|E
2500|$|There's a <b>word</b> <b>we</b> {{used to use}} in Jamaica called 'streggae'.

This one morning me and my two friends were playing and I said, 'OK man, let's do the reggay.' It was just {{something}} that came out of my mouth. So we just start singing 'Do the reggay, do the reggay' and created a beat. People tell me later that we had given the sound its name.

The first song was recorded just hours before they were leaving the studio and is a brief piano interlude. They were impressed that Anders Nordin played the piano very well. Lindgren said, [...] "I remember the look on Dan's face when we said, 'Our drummer can play the piano.' He didn't believe a <b>word</b> <b>we</b> were saying. Dan can play the piano. Most guys play like shit. When Anders started playing, Dan was actually impressed." [...] Åkerfeldt later said, [...] "I'm still quite impressed." [...] The other instrumental is an acoustic epic, according to Lindgren. Åkerfeldt borrowed a Spanish acoustic guitar called a Trameleuc from a guitar store to play the song.|$|E

2500|$|Looking {{for better}} {{distribution}} of their records, Big Black negotiated {{a deal with}} Homestead Records. Gerard Cosloy, who had befriended Albini through writing for Matter and gone on to work at Homestead, negotiated an unorthodox deal for the band: Big Black merely licensed their recordings to Homestead for specific lengths of time, rather than the label retaining {{the rights to the}} recordings as was typical. Further, the band took no advance payments, paid for their own recordings, and signed no contracts. Durango later remarked that [...] "We came from a punk perspective — {{we did not want to}} get sucked into a corporate culture where basically you're signing a contract because you don't trust the other person to live up to their <b>word.</b> <b>We</b> had ideals, and that was one of our ideals." [...] The band members figured that if a record company were going to cheat them, they would be able to do so with or without a contract because the band couldn't afford to defend themselves.|$|E
2500|$|In {{summarizing}} the biographical works on Gandhi, Blema S. Steinberg concluded she was decidedly non-ideological. Only 7.4% (24) {{of the total}} 330 biographical extractions posit ideology {{as a reason for}} her policy choices. Steinberg noted Gandhi's association with socialism was superficial; only having a general and traditional commitment to the ideology, by way of her political and family ties. Gandhi personally had a fuzzy concept of socialism. In one of the early interviews she had given as Prime Minister, Gandhi had ruminated: [...] "I suppose you could call me a socialist, but you have understand what we mean by that term...we used the word [...] because it came closest to {{what we wanted to do}} here – which is to eradicate poverty. You can call it socialism; but if by using that <b>word</b> <b>we</b> arouse controversy, I don't see why we should use it. I don't believe in words at all." [...] Regardless of the debate over her ideology or lack of thereof, Gandhi remains a left-wing icon. She has been described by Hindustan Times columnist, Pankaj Vohra as [...] "arguably the greatest mass leader of the last century." [...] Her campaign slogan, Garibi Hatao (Eng: Remove Poverty), has become the iconic motto of the Indian National Congress. To the rural and urban poor, untouchables, minorities and women in India, Gandhi was [...] "Indira Amma or Mother Indira." ...|$|E
