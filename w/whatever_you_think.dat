[...] This was the year the biggest and best show on TV somehow got bigger and better." [...] Before the final, Digital Spy's reality television editor Alex Fletcher listed his five favourite moments from the series. His favourite moment was Nhengu's elimination, on which he said [...] "No other show can make people so passionate, angry and feel like they really know the programme's stars. With only approximately 30 minutes of screentime, Gamu had managed to capture the hearts of millions. <b>Whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of Simon Cowell's programmes, {{you have to give}} them credit for achieving that." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "A Short Story About Love" [...] {{the fifteenth}} best {{episode of the}} series, {{explaining}} [...] "The timeline reboot of season 4 frustrated some fans, but the premise yielded several truly cool capture-the-imagination ideas that made for provocative drama, most notably Fringes most romantic hour... The fact that the episode also featured one of the show's seediest creepazoids — a serial killer who murdered men for their pheromones so {{he could make a}} perfume that allowed him to seduce their grieving female significant others — was a bonus. Icky, but bonus." [...] Cory Barker of TV.com named the episode the 17th best of the series, saying, [...] "Fringe has never been afraid of coming up with intimate, emotionally based—and sometimes very hokey—resolutions for its grand plots. <b>Whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about the choices the writers made in Season 4, it's hard to deny the emotional wallop this episode delivered." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of his {{programmes}} involve proffering unrehearsed {{answers to}} the public on scientific topics, as on the Cliff Michelmore series <b>Whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> (BBC) and Science Hour with Clive Bull ( [...] for LBC). On television he hosted a game show Computer Challenge and the documentary series Food for Thought in Britain and Jensheits das Kanals in Germany. His recent TV appearances include presenting The Man Behind the da Vinci Code and featuring in Weird Weapons of World War II, based on his two books about the Second World War (see below).|$|E

60|$|ELLIE. Well, you see, Mr Mangan, {{my mother}} married {{a very good}} man--for <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> may <b>think</b> of my father {{as a man of}} business, he is the soul of goodness--and she is not at all keen on my doing the same.|$|R
2500|$|Take three spoonfuls of Allemande, six ditto of aspic, {{and two of}} oil. Add {{a little}} {{tarragon}} vinegar, that has not boiled, some pepper and salt, and minced ravigotte, or merely some parsley.

60|$|MRS WHITEFIELD. [hastily] Now, Ann, I do beg {{you not to}} put it on me. I have {{no opinion}} on the subject; and if I had, it would {{probably}} not be attended to. I am quite with <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> three <b>think</b> best.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} I have acted wrongly and broken your Law. I {{did it to}} save Unc Nunkie, and thought I would not be found out. But I am guilty of this act and <b>whatever</b> {{punishment}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I deserve I will suffer willingly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Next Monday I {{have a large}} sum due to me, and I shall then most {{certainly}} repay what <b>you</b> advance, with <b>whatever</b> interest <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it right to charge. But it is very essential {{to me that the}} money should be paid at once.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Now, father," [...] {{the girl}} protested, {{with a pretty}} colour in her cheeks, [...] "you know I have never said {{anything}} of the sort, though I did say that I wished I had thrown a cloak round me.
