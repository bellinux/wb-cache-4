5|$|As the <b>war</b> <b>years</b> went, the newspaper's {{finances}} gradually improved. The Norwegian state {{became more}} active in production and trade and contributed many advertisements. Demokraten acquired its own type-setting machine in October 1918 and a printing press in 1917, which it used from 1 January 1918. From 1 July 1918, circulation once again increased to six days a week.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} British cities, there was {{immigration}} from various Commonwealth {{countries in the}} post <b>war</b> <b>years,</b> which did lead to some racist tension. In 1963, a colour bar operated by Bristol Omnibus Company, which at that time refused to employ Black or Asian bus crews, was successfully challenged in the Bristol Bus Boycott, which was considered to have been instrumental in the eventual passage of the Race Relations Act 1968. In 1980 a police raid on a cafe in St Paul's sparked the St Pauls riot, which highlighted the alienation of the city's ethnic minorities.|$|E

5|$|Cookie {{cutting and}} decorating reached its {{cultural}} zenith during the boomer years with Christmas cookie cutouts of reindeer, trees, stars, and bells providing sustenance {{for kids and}} dads.

5|$|Coward's most {{enduring}} {{work from the}} <b>war</b> <b>years</b> was the hugely successful black comedy Blithe Spirit (1941), about a novelist who researches the occult and hires a medium. A séance brings back the ghost of his first wife, causing havoc for the novelist and his second wife. With 1,997 consecutive performances, it broke box-office records for the run of a West End comedy, and was also produced on Broadway, where its original run was 650 performances.

5|$|Due to his {{casualty}} {{studies on}} mustard gas from an accident {{during the war}} in Italy, Rhoads became interested in its potential for cancer treatment. For the rest of his life, his research interest was in developing chemotherapy for cancer treatment, but he served primarily as an administrator and scientific director at Memorial and Sloan-Kettering. From studies of mustard gas, he developed a drug called mechlorethamine or Mustargen. Its success in clinical trials during the <b>war</b> <b>years</b> was the basis {{for the development of the}} field of anti-cancer chemotherapy. Rhoads also became interested in total body irradiation, which led to early work on chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Elgar's other {{compositions}} {{during the}} war included incidental music for a children's play, The Starlight Express (1915); a ballet, The Sanguine Fan (1917); and The Spirit of England (1915–17, to poems by Laurence Binyon), three choral settings very different in character from the romantic patriotism of his earlier years. His last large-scale composition of the <b>war</b> <b>years</b> was The Fringes of the Fleet, settings of verses by Rudyard Kipling, performed with great popular success around the country, until Kipling for unexplained reasons objected to their performance in theatres. Elgar conducted a recording of the work for the Gramophone Company.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the loss of}} life by uniformed soldiers, millions died in the superpowers' proxy wars around the globe, most notably in Southeast Asia. Most of the proxy wars and subsidies for local conflicts ended along with the Cold War; interstate wars, ethnic wars, revolutionary wars, as well as refugee and displaced persons crises have declined sharply in the post-Cold <b>War</b> <b>years.</b> Left over from the Cold War are numbers stations, which are shortwave radio stations thought to be used to broadcast covert messages, some of which can still be heard today.|$|E

5|$|No {{immediate}} {{effort was}} made to start the works and they were postponed indefinitely when World War I started. With wartime restrictions in place, construction work for the railway was prevented. Yearly extensions to the earlier E acts were granted under special wartime powers each year from 1916 until 1922, giving a final date by which compulsory purchases had to be made of 7 August 1924. Although the permissions had been maintained, the UERL could not raise the money needed for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the <b>war</b> <b>years</b> and the returns produced by the company could not cover the cost of repaying loans.|$|E

Real aggregate Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declined by 9.5 per cent over the period 1914 to 1920, while the mobilization of personnel resulted in a 6 per cent decline in civilian employment. Meanwhile, although population growth continued during the <b>war</b> <b>years,</b> it was only half that of the prewar rate. Per capita incomes also declined sharply, falling by 16 per cent.|$|E
5|$|Quackenbush {{was born}} on March 2, 1922, in Toronto, Ontario. He was born Hubert George Quackenbush but was given the {{nickname}} Bill by his aunt who disliked his given name.

Quackenbush had an opportunity to play football professionally, but he decided to pursue a career in hockey.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{all other}} leagues in the country, the Gauliga Hamburg managed to {{complete}} its program {{in its last}} season, 1944-45 before the collapse of Nazi Germany finished all competition.

5|$|The German {{pilots were}} {{increasingly}} lacking in quantity and quality. Galland recognised this {{but could not}} correct it without stepping outside his own authority.

The Luftwaffe did not match this effort.|$|E
5|$|The civil <b>war</b> <b>years</b> of Matilda's {{life have}} been the subject of {{historical}} fiction.

Peters paints the Empress as proud and aloof, in contrast to Stephen, a tolerant man and a reasonable ruler. Matilda's martial reputation may also have contributed to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's decision to entitle his 1855 battle poem Maud.|$|E
