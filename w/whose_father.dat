5|$|The prison {{became known}} {{around the world}} in the 19th century through the writing of the English novelist Charles Dickens, <b>whose</b> <b>father</b> was sent there in 1824, when Dickens was 12, for a debt to a baker.

30|$|To {{test whether}} {{respondents}} <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> {{did not work}} experience worklessness differently than their peers <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> worked, the association of being out of work with overall wellbeing is studied.

30|$|The {{interaction}} between fathers’ warmth and control {{was not statistically}} significant; however, the main effects of fathers’ warmth and control were significant. Follow-up ANOVA revealed significant differences in clinical maladjustment depending on the father’s warmth and control. Adolescents <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> had low levels of warmth scored more highly in clinical maladjustment than those with fathers presenting high levels of warmth [HSDBonferroni[*]=[*] 5.24, p[*]<[*]. 001, g´[*]=[*] 0.43].

ANOVAs also indicated that {{there were significant differences}} in school maladjustment depending on the father’s warmth but there were no such differences with respect to control.

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{paternal}} worklessness is estimated on eight different outcomes. The sample {{varies depending on}} whether employment probability or job characteristics are the outcome. The final sample for employment probability consists of 472 children <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> did not work and a control group of 856 young adults <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> worked in a lower paying occupation. When studying job characteristics, the sample consists of 259 young adults <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> did not work and a control group of 622 young adults.|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{investigation}} of 475 workers exposed to dust in flax processing {{has shown that}} family susceptibility has a decisive {{role in the development}} of byssinosis in those workers. Workers <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> had occupational history of exposure to flax dust were more resistant to the development of the disease than those <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> had no such history. Such tolerance was much higher in workers <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> were byssinotic than those with byssinosis-free fathers. Further hereditary and immunological investigations are, however, needed...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} the Stockholm Birth Cohort Study to {{document}} intergenerational associations in drunk driving between fathers and their children. The proportion of sons {{with a record of}} drunk driving is 2. 3 times larger for sons <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> have a conviction for drunk driving than for sons <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> have not been convicted. For daughters, the proportion is 7. 8 times larger. The average number of convictions is twice as large for sons <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> have a conviction for drunk driving than for sons <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> have not been convicted. For daughters, the average number of convictions is 15. 3 times larger. We argue that these intergenerational associations in drunk driving have important implications for treatment strategies and public policy. ...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{nationwide}} population-based dataset, {{the aim of}} the present study was to investigate the association between paternal schizophrenia and the risk of low birthweight (LBW). This study linked the 2001 Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Dataset with Taiwan's birth and death certificate registries. In total, 220 [*] 465 singleton live births were included. The key dependent variable was whether or not an infant's father was diagnosed with schizophrenia, while the independent variable of interest was whether an infant had LBW. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the relationship between paternal schizophrenia and the risk of LBW, after adjusting for the infant and parents’ characteristics. The results show that infants <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> had schizophrenia were more likely to have LBW than those <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> did not (12. 6 % vs 8. 0 %). Infants <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> had schizophrenia were found to be 1. 58 (95 % confidence interval[*]=[*] 1. 10 – 2. 52, P <. 05) times more likely to have LBW than their counterparts <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> did not have schizophrenia, following adjustment for gestational week at birth, parity, paternal age and highest educational level, family monthly incomes, and marital status. We conclude that the offspring <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> had a diagnosis of schizophrenia had increased risk of LBW compared with those <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> had no schizophrenia. This finding paves the way for further studies and suggests that there may be potential benefit to early intervention to prevent LBW in pregnant women with husbands with schizophrenia...|$|R

50|$|Studies {{have also}} found that girls <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> left the family early in their lives had {{the highest rates of}} early sexual {{activity}} and adolescent pregnancy.

Even when the researchers took into account other factors that could have contributed to early sexual activity and pregnancy, such as behavioral problems and life adversity, early father-absent girls were still about five times more likely in the United States and three times more likely in New Zealand to become pregnant as adolescents than were father-present girls.|$|R

For data collection, we used a questionnaire adapted to measure forms of aggression Little, Brauner, Jones, Hawley (2003). The results of our research show that there is {{a significant difference between the}} two groups of subjects with regard to forms of aggression studied. The alternate assumptions are confirmed. In other words, physical aggression is more common among those <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> have a primary level compared to their counterparts <b>whose</b> <b>fathers</b> have a higher level of education study.
