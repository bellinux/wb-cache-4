50|$|The book details Hitchcock's {{acquisition}} of the original novel by Robert Bloch to his work with two different screenwriters, casting, filming, editing, scoring, and promotion. Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho shows {{the daily lives of}} the filmmakers, who believed they were making a modestly budgeted, black-and-white shocker, representing a radical departure from the elegant, suspenseful films that had made director Hitchcock's reputation, including Rope, Rear <b>Window,</b> To <b>Catch</b> a Thief, The Man Who Knew Too Much, and North by Northwest.|$|R
60|$|What I saw {{reassured}} me vastly. A small wood {{fire was}} crackling {{in one of}} those old-fashioned country grates, and beside it was seated a strikingly handsome young man, who was reading earnestly out of a fat little book. He had an oval, olive-tinted face, with long black hair, ungathered in a queue, and there was something of the poet or of the artist in his whole appearance. The sight of that refined face, and of the warm yellow firelight which beat upon it, was a very cheering one to a cold and famished traveller. I stood for an instant gazing at him, and noticing the way in which his full and somewhat loose-fitting lower lip quivered continually, as if he were repeating to himself that which he was reading. I was still looking at him when he put his book down upon the table and approached the <b>window.</b> <b>Catching</b> a glimpse of my figure in the darkness he called out something which I could not hear, and waved his hand in a gesture of welcome. An instant later the door flew open, and there was his thin tall figure standing upon the threshold, with his skirts flapping in the wind.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the frequency and}} geographical distribution of children falling from a height in London and to suggest possible causes and preventative measures. METHODS: All relevant cases attended by the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) in a {{three and a half}} year period were reviewed and the locations related to the boroughs. The rates, per 1, 000 resident children, were compared with socioeconomic indices for the boroughs concerned. In addition, a survey was undertaken of window fittings and maintenance in high rise flats close to one particular incident. RESULTS: A total of 90 incidents were attended involving 91 patients (64 male, 27 female) of whom five died. HEMS attends approximately one third of incidents involving serious trauma. In the study period the maximum frequency was 0. 2 fallers per 1, 000 resident children, occurring in three boroughs. In three boroughs there were no fallers. There was no overlap in socioeconomic indices between the five boroughs with the highest fall rates and the five with the lowest. The building survey found a high incidence of faulty <b>window</b> <b>catches,</b> a slow response rate for repair, and a lack of safety advice for residents. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of falling is related to urban deprivation, poor maintenance, and lack of safety information. A combination of regulation and targeted education could substantially decrease deaths and injuries in children from this cause...|$|R

30|$|The image {{post-processing}} technology {{based on}} MATLAB was applied in oil-film interferometry {{to calculate the}} skin friction coefficient of smooth and roughness flat plate. This method can recognize the bright and dark fringes efficiently and robustly by the standard deviation-based algorithm.

In addition, the calculation window size can adjust automatically, which improved the robustness of the algorithm greatly. By comparing the experimental results with the numerical results, it is proved that the method of the image post-processing based on MATLAB can accurately measure the skin friction in hypersonic flow.|$|R
60|$|Three {{days after}} the master and {{mistress}} of Combe-Raven had come back, the female {{members of the family}} happened to be assembled together in the morning-room. The view from the windows looked over the flower-garden and shrubbery; this last being protected at its outward extremity by a fence, and approached from the lane beyond by a wicket-gate. During an interval in the conversation, the attention of the ladies was suddenly attracted to this gate, by the sharp sound of the iron latch falling in its socket.

Mrs. Cobb was charged with murder and then released on a $7,000 recognizance bond. She was acquitted on March 31, 1906.

40|$|Why is {{neutrino}} physics interesting today? I can list four reasons. First, our neutrino detectors actually disprove a claim made by {{the inventor}} of the neutrino more than sixty years ago. In his 1930 letter to the participants at the Radioactivity Conference in Tübingen, Pauli had proposed an undetectable neutral particle. Second, neutrinos – either as beams or as final state products – constitute clean and accurate probes into leptonic and semileptonic weak processes since they appear to have no interactions other than the weak one. Third, neutrinos provide a <b>window</b> to <b>catch</b> a glimpse of various types of possible new physics beyond the Standard Model – seesaw mechanisms, new generations, left-right symmetries, grand unified theories etc. Finally, the study of primary cosmic neutrinos, i. e. neutrino astronomy, is beginning to unravel mysteries of various astrophysical objects. A major part of neutrino physics is concerned with relatively low-energy neutrinos or antineutrinos. These can come from astronomical sources such as the sun, a supernova, etc. Alternatively, they can be produced fro...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Our {{proposed}} scheme seeks to defend floodingbased distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) {{attacks in the}} Internet. An easy, yet very disruptive, way to cause unfairness to the legitimate users is to deplete the network bandwidth by sending high rate unresponsive flows from multiple sources. The network congestion created by such malicious flows causes most legitimate packets dropped at routers without reaching to their destinations. Congestion control in IP networks is typically done at each router through queue management, and the network is entirely dependent on the end hosts to react congestion. However, when the network is under attacks which use packet floods, existing queue management algorithms reveal significant shortcomings in protecting legitimate flows. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for congestion control in IP networks to defend DDoS attacks. Our approach is a time-window based filtering mechanism processed before a queue management policy is applied. Setting the window size properly and dropping packets reaching in the next <b>window</b> can <b>catch</b> the non-responsive nature of misbehaving flows. The performance of our {{proposed scheme}} is demonstrated through extensive simulations using the NS 2 simulator.

It is then decided that the four of them will go and tell Louise and Maxine not to ambush the car with Hitler and Göring, since they are in fact Edith and René. However, this was not necessary, since they explain they have no intention of ambushing anything this night.|$|R
