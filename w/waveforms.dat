5|$|In 1924, Louis de Broglie {{proposed}} that all particles behave {{to an extent}} like waves. In 1926, Erwin Schrödinger used this idea to develop a mathematical model of the atom that described the electrons as three-dimensional <b>waveforms</b> rather than point particles. A consequence of using <b>waveforms</b> to describe particles {{is that it is}} mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the position and momentum of a particle at a given point in time; this became known as the uncertainty principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1926. In this concept, for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum, and vice versa.|$|E

Even a simple overvoltage pulse entering a cable system as uncomplicated as the power wiring found in a typical private home can result in an oscillatory disturbance as the pulse is reflected to and fro from multiple circuit ends. These ring waves as they are known persist for far longer than the original pulse and their <b>waveforms</b> bears little obvious resemblance to the original disturbance, containing high frequency components {{in the tens of}} MHz range.|$|E

5|$|Two {{versions}} of the machine were produced. The first was the world's first transistorised computer, and became operational in November 1953. The second version was completed in April 1955. The 1955 version used 200 transistors, 1,300 solid-state diodes, and had a power consumption of 150 watts. The machine did however make use of valves to generate its 125kHz clock <b>waveforms</b> and in the circuitry {{to read and write}} on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the first completely transistorised computer, a distinction that went to the Harwell CADET of 1955.|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to suggest the method to simulate <b>waveform</b> coming from complex targets. First, we analysed the previous relevant works. And based on these we attempted to generate the simulated <b>waveform</b> over the complex surfaces. For the <b>waveform</b> simulation, we defined the sub-beams spread with a consistent interval within the beam’s divergence coverage. Each sub-beam has its geometry (origin and direction) and the transmitted energy considering the laser beam’s profile. Then, we searched the surfaces that intersect with sub-beams using ray-tracing algorithm, and computed the intersection points and the received energies. Using on the computed distance, the received energy and predefined pulse model, we generated the signals of echoes and put them together into a <b>waveform.</b> Finally, we completed the <b>waveform</b> simulation adding the signal noise. As a result of performing <b>waveform</b> simulation, we confirmed that the <b>waveform</b> data was successfully simulated by the proposed method.

5|$|A {{consequence}} of describing electrons as <b>waveforms</b> {{is that it}} is mathematically impossible to simultaneously derive the position and momentum of an electron. This became known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle after the theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg, who first described it and published it in 1927. This invalidated Bohr's model, with its neat, clearly defined circular orbits. The modern model of the atom describes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities. An electron can potentially be found at any distance from the nucleus, but, depending on its energy level, exists more frequently in certain regions around the nucleus than others; this pattern is referred to as its atomic orbital. The orbitals {{come in a variety of}} shapes-sphere, dumbbell, torus, etc.-with the nucleus in the middle.|$|E

The Game Boy's sound hardware was {{different from that of}} the Famicom, which Uematsu was used to composing for at the time, with new stereo and <b>waveforms</b> and only three notes; as a result, Uematsu struggled with deciding how to work with these, developing new themes for the music in the process despite SaGa 1s director Akitoshi Kawazu's desire to have the music be in the same vein as Square's preceding Final Fantasy titles. Uematsu has stated that the Game Boy was a system he would like to compose for again. SaGa 2 was the first soundtrack or album that Kenji Ito worked on.|$|E

This represents a possible echo from a target at that position. Note that there are several optional approaches here, depending on the precision of the <b>waveform</b> timing, among other things. For example, if phase cannot be accurately known, then only the envelope magnitude (with the help of a Hilbert transform) of the <b>waveform</b> sample might be added to the voxel.

40|$|<b>Waveform</b> {{inversion}} is {{the method}} of choice for determining a highly heterogeneous subsurface structure. However, conventional <b>waveform</b> inversion requires that the wavefield for each source is computed separately. This makes it very expensive for realistic 3 D seismic surveys. Source-encoding <b>waveform</b> inversion, in which the sources are modeled simultaneously, is considerably faster than conventional <b>waveform</b> inversion but suffers from artifacts. These artifacts can partly be removed by assigning random weights to the source wavefields. We found that the misfit function, and therefore also its gradient, for source-encoding <b>waveform</b> inversion is an unbiased random estimation of the misfit function used in conventional <b>waveform</b> inversion. We found a new method of source-encoding <b>waveform</b> inversion {{that takes into account}} the random nature of the gradients used in the optimization. In this new method, the gradient at each iteration is a weighted average of past gradients such that the most recent gradients have the largest weights with exponential decay. This way we damped the random fluctuations of the gradient by incorporating information from the previous iterations. We compared this new method with existing source-encoding <b>waveform</b> inversion methods as well as conventional <b>waveform</b> inversion and found that the model misfit reduction is faster and smoother than those of existing source-encoding <b>waveform</b> inversion methods, and it approaches the model misfit reduction obtained in conventional <b>waveform</b> inversion.
