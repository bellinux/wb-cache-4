5|$|Johan Huizinga (1872–1945) {{acknowledged}} {{the existence of}} the Renaissance but questioned whether it was a positive change. In his book The Waning of the Middle Ages, he argued that the Renaissance <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> decline from the High Middle Ages, destroying much that was important. The Latin language, for instance, had evolved greatly from the classical period and was still a living language used in the church and elsewhere. The Renaissance obsession with classical purity halted its further evolution and saw Latin revert to its classical form. Robert S. Lopez has contended that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> deep economic recession. Meanwhile, George Sarton and Lynn Thorndike have both argued that scientific progress was perhaps less original than has traditionally been supposed. Finally, Joan Kelly argued that the Renaissance led to greater gender dichotomy, lessening the agency women had had during the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Ioann Zlatoust {{began on}} 14 November 1903, {{well before the}} formal keel-laying {{ceremony}} on 13 November 1904. Progress was relatively quick, despite the disruptions caused by the 1905 Revolution, and she was launched on 13 May 1906. Fitting-out, however, was considerably delayed {{by a number of}} changes made as the navy digested the lessons of the Russo-Japanese War. For example there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> seven months in 1907 where virtually no work was done on the ship and she was not completed until 1 April 1911. Ioann Zlatousts turrets had originally been intended for a reconstruction of the elderly pre-dreadnought , but they were diverted to Ioann Zlatoust after that reconstruction was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Cutthroat {{competition}} {{was nothing to}} what was to follow. The 1890s were a tough time for the Romanian economy, and {{a rising tide of}} anti-Semitism made it an even tougher time for the Jews. One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those intellectuals who remained were more interested in politics than in theater: this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> social ferment, with Jewish socialists in Iaşi starting Der Veker (The Awakener).|$|E

5|$|Following the {{failures}} of the hastily planned commando operations undertaken in June and July 1940, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> inactivity in which the concept was refined and detailed planning was undertaken while individual units carried out extensive and specialised training. In early 1941 a number of raids were undertaken but No. 6 Commando did not conduct its first operation until later in the year.|$|E
5|$|From 1774 until 1858, Madras {{was a part}} of British India and {{was ruled}} by the British East India Company. The last quarter of the 18th century <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> rapid expansion. Successful wars against Tipu Sultan (1782–99), Velu Thambi, Polygars and Ceylon added vast areas of land and contributed to the {{exponential}} growth of the Presidency. Newly conquered Ceylon formed part of the Madras Presidency between 1793 and 1798. The system of subsidiary alliances originated by Lord Wellesley as Governor-General of India (1798–1805) also brought many princely states into the area militarily subordinate to the Governor of Fort St George. The hill tracts of Ganjam and Visakhapatnam were the last places to be annexed by the British.|$|E
5|$|Her {{reign of}} 63 years and seven months {{is known as}} the Victorian era and was longer than that of any of her predecessors. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> industrial, cultural, political, scientific, and {{military}} change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the British Empire. She was the last British monarch of the House of Hanover. Her son and successor, Edward VII, inaugurated the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the line of his father.|$|E

5|$|In 1912 {{geologist}} Thomas Jaggar {{founded the}} Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. The facility {{was taken over}} in 1919 by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and in 1924 by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which marked the start of continuous volcano observation on Hawaii island. The next century <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> thorough investigation, marked by contributions from many top scientists. The first complete evolutionary model was first formulated in 1946, by USGS geologist and hydrologist Harold T. Stearns. Since that time, advances have enabled the study of previously limited areas of observation (e.g. improved rock dating methods and submarine volcanic stages).|$|E
5|$|The 1850s <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> {{transition}} for the ice trade. The {{industry was}} already quite large: in 1855 around $6–7 million ($118–138 million in 2010 terms) was {{invested in the}} industry in the U.S. and an estimated two million tons (two billion kg) of ice was kept in storage {{at any one time}} in warehouses across the nation. Over the coming decade, however, the focus of the growing trade shifted away from relying upon the international export market in favour of supplying first the growing, eastern cities of the US, and then the rest of the rapidly expanding country.|$|E
5|$|The Blitz <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> {{sustained}} strategic {{bombing of}} the United Kingdom by Germany during the Second World War. Between 7 September 1940 and 21 May 1941, sixteen British cities were hit by major aerial raids. Beginning on 7 September 1940, London was bombed by the Luftwaffe for 57 consecutive nights. Overall, {{more than one million}} London houses were destroyed or damaged during the Blitz, and more than 40,000 civilians were killed, almost half of them in London.|$|E

5|$|The Bone Wars, {{also known}} as the Great Dinosaur Rush, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> intense and ruthlessly {{competitive}} fossil hunting and discovery during the Gilded Age of American history, marked by a heated rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope (of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia) and Othniel Charles Marsh (of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale). Each of the two paleontologists used underhanded methods to try to outdo the other in the field, resorting to bribery, theft, and the destruction of bones. Each scientist also sought to ruin his rival's reputation and cut off his funding, using attacks in scientific publications.|$|E
5|$|The Late Woodland era is {{generally}} considered to have begun about 600 AD and lasted until the arrival of Europeans in Indiana. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> rapid cultural change. One of the new developments—which {{has yet to be}} explained—was the introduction of masonry, shown by the construction of large, stone forts, many of which overlook the Ohio River. Romantic legend used to attribute the forts to Welsh Indians who supposedly arrived centuries before Christopher Columbus reached the Caribbean. Archaeologists and other scholars have found no evidence for that theory and believe that the cultural development was engendered by the Mississippian culture.|$|E
5|$|The Ottomans quickly {{transformed}} {{the city from}} a bastion of Christianity to a symbol of Islamic culture. Religious foundations were established to fund the construction of ornate imperial mosques, often adjoined by schools, hospitals, and public baths. The Ottoman Dynasty claimed the status of caliphate in 1517, with Istanbul remaining the capital of this last caliphate for four centuries. Suleiman the Magnificent's reign from 1520 to 1566 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> especially great artistic and architectural achievement; chief architect Mimar Sinan designed several iconic buildings in the city, while Ottoman arts of ceramics, stained glass, calligraphy, and miniature flourished. The population of Istanbul was 570,000 {{by the end of}} the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|The early 9th century, however, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> direct {{imitation}} of Chinese models making kanshi the major form of poetry at the time. In the late 9th century, waka {{and the development}} of kana script rose simultaneously with the general revival of traditional values, culminating in the compilation of the first imperial waka anthology, the Kokinshū, in 905. It was followed in 951 by the Gosen Wakashū; in all seven imperial anthologies were compiled in the Heian period. The main poetic subjects were love and the four seasons; the standards of vocabulary, grammar and style, established in the Kokinshū, dominated waka composition into the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The late 18th century <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> {{change in}} the {{interior}} design of English country houses. The Baroque concept of the principal floor, or piano nobile, with a large bedroom suite known as the state apartments, was gradually abandoned in favour of smaller, more private bedrooms on the upper floors. The principal floor became a series of reception rooms, each with a designated purpose, creating separate withdrawing, dining, music, and ballrooms. In the late-18th century, it became common to arrange reception and public rooms on a lower floor, with bedrooms and more private rooms above. West Wycombe perfectly reflects this arrangement.|$|E

5|$|The {{second half}} of the sixth century <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> {{political}} disorder in Arabia and communication routes were no longer secure. Religious divisions were an important cause of the crisis. Judaism became the dominant religion in Yemen while Christianity took root in the Persian Gulf area. In line with broader trends of the ancient world, the region witnessed a decline in the practice of polytheistic cults and a growing interest in a more spiritual form of religion. While many were reluctant to convert to a foreign faith, those faiths provided intellectual and spiritual reference points.|$|E
5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> renewed {{lobbying}} for a road crossing in the 1920s and 1930s, {{at which time}} the only vehicle crossing was a single passenger and vehicle ferry. Sir William Denny championed the expansion of that service in the 1930s, providing and operating {{on behalf of the}} London and North Eastern Railway two additional ferries that aimed to supplement the services of the adjacent railway bridge. Their success allowed for the addition of two more craft in the 1940s and 1950s, by which time the ferries were making 40,000 crossings annually, carrying 1.5 million passengers and 800,000 vehicles.|$|E
5|$|After Isaacs left, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> {{managerial}} instability, {{with three}} chief executives in three years. Isaacs's successor, Genista McIntosh, resigned in May 1997 after five months, citing ill-health. Her post was filled by Mary Allen, who {{moved into the}} job from the Arts Council. Allen's selection did not comply with the Council's rules for such appointments, and following a critical House of Commons Select Committee report on {{the management of the}} opera house she resigned in March 1998, as did the entire board of the opera house, including the chairman, Lord Chadlington. A new board appointed Michael Kaiser as general director in September 1998. He oversaw the restoration of the two companies' finances and the re-opening of the opera house. He was widely regarded as a success, and there was some surprise when he left in June 2000 after less than two years to run the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.|$|E
