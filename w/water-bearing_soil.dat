40|$|This {{series of}} seven {{activities}} {{allows students to}} demonstrate knowledge about what ground water is, explain how it moves through the soil and how it interacts with surface water, and learn how it is extracted for use as drinking water. Students will discover that when water enters the saturated zone, it {{becomes part of the}} ground water, that the top of this saturated zone is called the water table, and that the water table may be very close to the ground surface or it may be as much as 200 to 600 feet deep. They will also learn that <b>water-bearing</b> <b>soil</b> or rock formation that is capable of yielding enough water for human use is called an aquifer, and in bedrock aquifers water can move through cracks, or fractures. How quickly water passes through, or infiltrates, the soil is a function of permeability, which depends on {{the size and shape of}} the soil particles, the amount of pore space between the particles, and whether or not the pore spaces interconnect.

5|$|The geology of South Florida, {{together}} with a warm, wet, subtropical climate, provides conditions well-suited for a large marshland ecosystem. Layers of porous and permeable limestone create <b>water-bearing</b> rock and <b>soil</b> that affect the climate, weather, and hydrology of South Florida.|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} {{life is a}} primary goal of NASA s {{planetary}} exploration program. The search is, of necessity, tiered in both the detection approach (looking for evidence of microbial fossils or the presence {{of water in the}} geological history of a planetary body and/or looking for evidence of water, energy sources, precursors to life, signatures of life and/or life itself in the present day planetary environment) and in the survey method (scale, range, specificity) employed. Terrestrial investigations suggests that {{life as we know it}} requires water. Thus, the search for extant microbial life and habitats requires identifying <b>water-bearing</b> <b>soils.</b> Determining Reduction-Oxidation (REDOX) couples present in water, once it is found, provides information on soil geochemistry and identifies potential chemical energy sources for life. Mars offers a near-term target for conducting this search. The identification of gully formation [1], layered deposits [2] and elemental ratios of bromine and chlorine [3] present indirect evidence that water was abundant locally in the Martian past. Additionally, Viking images of polar ice and frost formation on the surface of Mars demonstrate that water can exist in at least some near-surface regions of present-day Mars. Atmospheric pressure data further suggest that liquid water may be stable for short periods of time in the mid-latitudes of the Martian surface. [4] Measurements of the global distribution of hydrogen in the Martian regolith offer tantalizing indirect evidence that water may at least exist in near-surface soils. [5] Evidently, any water to be found is likely to exist as soil mixtures at levels ranging between approx. 0. 5 % and approx. 5 %...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a proposal of methodology which is applicable for the monitoring of potential soil erosion caused by flowing water, using geoinformation systems (GIS). As an input to the multiplying analysis, the geological and geomorphologic data are used and further the soil properties, which condition {{the tendency of}} soil towards erosion (soil slaking - showing the soil resistance of the soil aggregates against the impact of raindrop and the maximum capilar capacity, showing the <b>water-bearing</b> capacity of <b>soil),</b> using the soil maps of the concerned area (using classification of soil units FAO) (the upper flow of the river basin Ostravice in the surroundings of the water tank Å ance) transferred into a digital form. These partial map data were multiplicated using the Arc Map programme. The resulting map represents {{the output of the}} multiplying analysis and shows the resistance of soil (or the tendency towards erosion of soil) found within the studied area...|$|R
50|$|The geology of South Florida, {{together}} with a warm, wet, subtropical climate, provides conditions well-suited for a large marshland ecosystem. Layers of porous and permeable limestone create <b>water-bearing</b> rock and <b>soil</b> that affect the climate, weather, and hydrology of South Florida.The properties of the rock underneath the Everglades {{can be explained by}} the geologic history of the state. The crust underneath Florida was at one point part of the African region of the supercontinent Gondwana. About 300 million years ago, North America merged with Africa, connecting Florida with North America. Volcanic activity centered on the eastern side of Florida covered the prevalent sedimentary rock with igneous rock. Continental rifting began to separate North America from Gondwana about 180 million years ago. When Florida was part of Africa, it was initially above water, but during the cooler Jurassic Period, the Florida Platform became a shallow marine environment in which sedimentary rocks were deposited. Through the Cretaceous Period, most of Florida remained a tropical sea floor of varying depths. The peninsula has been covered by seawater at least seven times since the bedrock formed.|$|R
