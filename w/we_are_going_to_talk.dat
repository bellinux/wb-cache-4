It isn't a distant, stifled roar like London. There's a harsh, clarion-like note about it, like metal striking upon metal. And the smell of New York--there isn't any other city like it!

After making {{yourself}} a target on the roof at Deennugghur, and jumping {{down in the middle}} of the Sepoys in the breach, and getting through that attack in the boats, I don't think you are fated to meet your end with a bullet. Well, now let us walk on, and join the others. Isobel must be wondering how much longer <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> together. She cannot exchange a word with the natives; it must be dull work for her. She is a great deal thinner than she was before these troubles came on. You see how differently she walks. She has quite lost that elastic step of hers, but I dare say that is a good deal due to her walking with bare feet instead of in English boots--boots have a good deal to do with a walk. Look at the difference between the walk of a gentleman who has always worn well fitting boots and that of a countryman who has gone about in thick iron shod boots all his life. Breeding goes for something, no doubt, and alters a man's walk just as it alters a horse's gait." ...|$|E

I have been through it in Vienna, I have been through it in Rome. I have sat at long tables with politicians, have drawn little {{pictures}} upon the blotting-paper and been bored to death. In wearisome fashion we have drafted agreements, we have quarrelled and bickered, we have yawned and made of ourselves men of parchment. But to-night," [...] he added, taking another huge bite from his sandwich, [...] "to-night nothing of that sort is intended. Draconmeyer and I have an idea. Mr. Grex is favourably inclined towards it. That idea isn't a bit of good to ourselves or any one else unless Monsieur Douaille here shares our point of view. Here we are, then, all met together--let us hope for a week or two's enjoyment. Little by little we must try and {{see what we can do}} towards instilling that idea into the mind of Monsieur Douaille. We may succeed, we may fail, but let us always remember that our conversations are the conversations of four friends, met together upon what is nothing more or less than a holiday.

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about {{information}} filters if {{we refer to}} newspaper editors and journalists when they provide a service that selects the most valuable information for their clients, readers of books, magazines, newspapers, radio listeners and viewers TV.

With the advent of the Internet it increases the possibility that anyone can publish low-cost all one wish. In this way, it increases considerably the less useful information and consequently the quality information is disseminated. With this problem, it began to devise new filtering with which we can get the information required for each specific topic to easily and efficiently.|$|E

5000|$|... "I {{would like}} to comment on the {{necessary}} courses a student should take to really be prepared to carry out research in model-based vision. As we can see the geometry of image projection and the mathematics of transformation is a very key element in studying this field, but there are many other issues the student has to be prepared for. If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about segmenting images and getting good geometric clues, we have to understand the relationship between the intensity of image data and its underlying geometry. And this would lead the student into such areas as optics, illumination theory, theory of shadows and the like. And also the mathematics underlying this kind of computations would of course require signal processing theory, fourier transform theory and the like. And in dealing with algebraic surfaces such as this curved surfaces as we talked about here, courses in algebraic geometry and higher pure forms of algebra will prove to be necessary in order to make any kind of progress in research to handle curved surfaces. So, I guess the bottom line of what I'm saying is: math courses, particularly those associated with geometric aspects will be key in all of this." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ollanta Humala, who {{had once}} led a {{military}} revolt in 2000 that was quickly put down, softened what was seen as his anti-capitalist tone to look more moderate {{along the lines of}} Brazil's former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. He told a campaign rally that [...] "We are willing to make many concessions to unite Peru, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with all political forces. Social problems must be resolved through dialogue. Let's vote without fear." [...] Voters were seen to vote against Garcia {{in order to have a}} [...] "fairer division of Peru's booming economy - backed by rich mineral resources - a key issue for more than a third of the population still living in poverty." [...] The other candidates tried to discredit him by saying he would increase state control over the economy, roll back reforms and jeopardise about $40bn in potential foreign investment over the next decade in mining and energy exploration. Moody's ratings agency also said that Peru's investment-grade credit rating would not be threatened should Humala win. Despite this the sol and the Lima Stock Exchange's flagship index main stock index fell over the two weeks before the first round of the election on speculation that Humala would raise mining taxes, increase state subsidies and/or tighten control of such [...] "strategic" [...] sectors as electricity.|$|E
5000|$|Chamberlain {{was shocked}} to find on 17 March that the {{majority}} of the Cabinet was in agreement with Ritchie, and that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had reversed the decision made the previous November. Balfour chose not to take sides, but did not oppose Ritchie for fear of losing his Chancellor on the eve of the budget. Chamberlain accepted that there was not enough time to debate the matter in Cabinet before the budget, and allowed Ritchie to have his way. The Chancellor presented a Free Trade on 23 April, during which Chamberlain was completely silent. Though Chamberlain had been taken aback by the Cabinet's switch, he prepared to surprise his colleagues in return. On 15 May, in the midst of his power base, Bingley Hall, Chamberlain remarked before his speech to the event's chief organiser, [...] "You can burn your leaflets. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about something else." [...] He lamented the demise of the corn tax to his audience and insisted that the greatness of the empire could be preserved by introducing Imperial Preference, which he hoped would dominate the next general election. His impromptu speech stunned Balfour and the Cabinet, the Prime Minister having just insisted publicly that it was not yet time to implement a policy of Imperial Preference. Furthermore, on 28 May, Chamberlain reiterated his challenge to Free Trade orthodoxy in the House of Commons, amidst cheering from many Unionists. Balfour hoped to calm the situation by devoting the summer to the question and publicly professed support for neither policy, earning him much criticism by the opposition Liberal Party.|$|E

Swedish news corporation Expressen gave the show five stars, believing that [...] "her two and a half hour show {{is by far the most}} lavish and eccentric they'd ever seen", complementing Gaga's [...] "flashes of humour... and smart political digs", and the show's intimacy and promotion of self-expression and love. The Guardian gave the show four out of five stars, stating that [...] "The tightly choreographed hits sound terrific, but it's when this curious star sabotages the slickness that she seems most herself". Regarding her performance at the O2 World in Berlin, Berliner Morgenpost reported that [...] "unlike Madonna, whose artificial spectacle you could experience at the same place, the younger rival is cheeky, fresh, uncompromising". Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang gave it a mixed review, admiring her voice, but saying that [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about content, it is similar Madonna's.

40|$|The {{relations}} hips {{between the}} image and the memory {{have been one of}} the most relevant subjects, in the critical, theoretical and academic relection, in the last decade. This refers specially to those manifestations connected to the traumatic memory. Photography and cinema, among other artistic expressions, have faced the way in which the violence’s memory and its features are revealed not only through the places, objects and bodies of the victims but the later generations. In this way, both memory and post-memory coexist and nourish many modern artistic practices in Latin America. In this paper, we are going to study some works created by several Argentinean artists and ilmmakers in which the corporality (the absence of ones’ bodies) plays an essential role.
