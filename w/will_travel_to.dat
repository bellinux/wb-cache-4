5|$|For a given tonnage, {{the second}} factor which governs the ship's {{dimensions}} {{is the size of}} the ports and waterways it <b>will</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to.</b> For example, a vessel that will pass the Panama Canal will be limited in its beam and draft. For most designs, the ratio of length-to-width ranges between 5 and 7, with an average of 6.2. The ratio of length-to-height will be between 11 and 12.|$|E
5|$|Since looking {{directly}} at the Sun can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness, special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. It is technically safe to view only the total phase of a total solar eclipse {{with the unaided eye}} and without protection; however, this is a dangerous practice, as most people are not trained to recognize the phases of an eclipse, which can span over two hours while the total phase can only last a maximum of 7.5 minutes for any one location. People referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles <b>will</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses.|$|E
5|$|World of Dance Tour (WOD) {{was founded}} in 2008 by Myron Marten and David Gonzales in Pomona, California. It differs from other {{competitions}} {{because there is no}} final championship. WOD travels to different cities in the United States, Canada, and Europe and holds a competition in each location; therefore, WOD distinguishes itself as a tour. Each tour stop is a stand-alone competition; they are all related to each other in name only. In 2013, WOD <b>will</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> New York City, Vallejo, Seattle, Vancouver, Berlin, Dallas, Toronto, San Diego, Montreal, Eindhoven, Boston, Orlando, Houston, Chicago, Seattle, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Union City, and Antwerp.|$|E

These include: being a women, those out of work, having children under 5, being a lone parent and using formal childcare.

5|$|After Gordon fends off a Combine {{attack on}} the base, Alyx gives Dr. Kleiner the message from Judith Mossman {{recovered}} at the Citadel. It contains footage and the coordinates of the Borealis, an Aperture Science research vessel which, Kleiner explains, vanished along with part of the surrounding drydock. Kleiner insists {{that it should be}} used to aid the Resistance effort, while Eli counters {{that it is impossible to}} control and must be destroyed. They agree that Alyx and Gordon <b>will</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> the Borealis and attempt to find Mossman. Alyx unconsciously delivers the G-Man's message to her father, shaking him. Alone with Gordon, Eli reveals that it was the G-Man who provided the test sample that caused the Black Mesa incident, and that he whispered the same warning to him as Gordon entered the test chamber. He promises to explain more after the portal is closed.|$|E
5|$|The station can be {{seen from}} the Earth with the naked eye and, as of , is the largest {{artificial}} satellite in Earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station. The Soyuz spacecraft delivers crew members, stays docked for their half-year-long missions and then returns them home. Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft service the ISS, they are the Russian Progress spacecraft which has done so since 2000, the European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) since 2008, the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) since 2009, the American Dragon spacecraft since 2012, and the American Cygnus spacecraft since 2013. The Space Shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay. Until another US manned spacecraft is ready, crew members <b>will</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> and from the International Space Station exclusively aboard the Soyuz. The highest number of people occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions.|$|E

This exhibition {{was the first to}} comprehensively examine the role played by visual images in shaping, influencing, and transforming the modern struggle for racial equality and justice in the United States. It opened at International Center of Photography in New York in May 2010 and traveled to the DuSable Museum of African American History (Chicago), Smithsonian National Museum of American History (DC), National Civil Rights Museum (Memphis), Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture (Baltimore), Addison Gallery of American Art (Andover, MA) and other venues. For All the World to See was selected by the National Endowment for the Humanities as the twelfth NEH on the Road exhibition, an initiative that adapted the exhibition in a smaller, lower security version that <b>will</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> up to 50 more venues, mostly smaller and mid-size institutions across the country over a ten-year period from 2012 to 2023.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{season with}} the OSUMB runs from June until January. Starting in June, the band runs Summer Sessions to train and teach {{prospective}} and returning band members. In July, the band performs a joint concert with the Columbus Symphony Orchestra. This event is typically performed with 1/2 to 3/4 of the full band, and often accepts volunteers who did not march the previous season. In August, the schedule becomes highly packed. There are often small pep band events throughout Columbus, at OSU's Regional Campuses across the state, {{as well as on}} the Columbus Campus. The band performs at all home football games, at an NFL game (either Cincinnati Bengals or Cleveland Browns), and at least one or two away games. In 2013, the band performed at four away games, a first for the band. If the football team is eligible for post-season play, the band <b>will</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> those games as well. On away trips, there is almost always an Ohio State rally, put on by the local chapter of the OSU Alumni Association. This rally features guest speakers, the band, and cheerleaders. For trips to the University of Michigan or Michigan State University, the band performs a sit-down concert in the Toledo, Ohio area. There are additional full-band performances such as the Homecoming Parade, Circleville Pumpkin Show Parade, and two big concerts: one in an often remote part of Ohio, and the annual concert in Columbus at Value City Arena (previously held at Veterans Memorial before its demolition during the 2014 season).|$|E
