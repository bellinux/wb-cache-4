Among men, western dress has greater acceptance.

5|$|Despite these differences, {{the leading}} causes {{of death in the}} United States are remarkably similar for men and women, headed by heart disease, which {{accounts}} for a quarter of all deaths, followed by cancer, lung disease and stroke. <b>While</b> <b>women</b> have a lower incidence of death from unintentional injury (see below) and suicide, they have a higher incidence of dementia (Gronowski and Schindler, Table I).|$|E
5|$|Members of this {{community}} also herd zebu and catch fish in Lake Alaotra. The work of fishing was traditionally subdivided by gender: men were only allowed to fish for eels, <b>while</b> <b>women</b> were tasked to use nets to catch small fish, and children {{were the only ones}} allowed to fish using poles. Men and children would traditionally leave their catch on the shore for women to pick up and take back to the village.|$|E

5|$|Women wore long dresses, blouses {{that came}} down to the knee, skirts and jackets with long or short sleeves, <b>while</b> <b>women</b> from wealthy {{families}} could wear purple scarves around their shoulders. The main difference in women's apparel from that of men was that it was fastened on the left, not on the right.|$|E
5|$|After the American Civil War, Stanton's {{commitment}} to female suffrage caused a schism in the women's rights movement when she, together with Susan B. Anthony, declined to support {{passage of the}} Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. She opposed giving added legal protection and voting rights to African American men <b>while</b> <b>women,</b> black and white, were denied those same rights. Her position on this issue, together with her thoughts on organized Christianity and women's issues beyond voting rights, {{led to the formation}} of two separate women's rights organizations that were finally rejoined, with Stanton as president of the joint organization, about twenty years after her break from the original women's suffrage movement.|$|E
5|$|En route, the {{presence}} of the Orions begins having an effect on the crew: men become increasingly aggressive, <b>while</b> <b>women</b> increasingly suffer from headaches. Navaar focuses her attentions on Archer, while D'Nesh seduces Commander Kelby. Arriving at the planet, a sluggish Archer orders Reed to destroy another ship, but he refuses and it escapes. Kelby meanwhile sabotages the warp drive before Commander Tucker can physically stop him. Afterwards, Doctor Phlox determines that the Orions are producing pheromones, causing the crew's adrenaline levels to spike. Only Commander T'Pol and Tucker remain unaffected, since she is Vulcan and he shares her immunity because of their psychic bond.|$|E

5|$|European {{visitors}} in 1667 reported the Sihanaka lived in fortified villages, which they very effectively defended with bows and arrows. They {{were the only}} ethnic group encountered by the European party that had built a bridge. Homes were made of plant material; the Sihanaka believed building homes in brick or clay would invite the displeasure of the ancestors. Gendered roles factored into house construction and maintenance: men applied carpentry to build {{the frame of the}} house and roof, as well as the windows and doors and their frames, <b>while</b> <b>women</b> wove zozoro reed mats that would serve as walls, flooring and roofing.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study done}} by Statistics Canada's General Social Survey of 10,000 households, the average man spent under {{two hours a day}} dealing with {{childcare}} and house work <b>while</b> <b>women</b> on average spent a little more than three. This study highlights the unequal distribution of labor between partners. Of the people surveyed, under fifteen percent of the couples agreed on doing around the same amount of work in the house. About 83 percent of women participated in housecleaning and food preparation compared to only 51 percent of men who were surveyed.|$|E
5|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that the Canadian Lady Corset Company had to act. In 1964, Moe Nadler died and his son, Larry Nadler inherited control of the company. Larry Nadler was a Harvard-trained MBA and brought modern marketing strategies to the industry. He commissioned market research that identified women's feelings about intimate apparel. Women did not hate their bras. Rather, they saw bras {{as a means to}} feel and look beautiful, to be fashionable and sexy, and to attract men. <b>While</b> <b>women</b> sometimes went braless, they were making a fashion choice and not a political statement. Canadian Lady's management knew that girdles were out, but bras would remain an essential part of women's wardrobes. So during the 1960s, while competitors were cutting back on their bra marketing and diversifying into other products, Canadian Lady aggressively pursued bra market share.|$|E

The Damara culture would continue to differentiate between a married and unmarried man or woman. An unmarried man is called an axa-aob <b>while</b> a <b>woman</b> is an oaxaes. An unmarried man would simply wear a ǁnaweb which is a loin-cloth that is tucked in between the legs <b>while</b> an unmarried <b>woman</b> wore a ǃgaes to cover genitalia and a ǀgâubes to cover the rears.|$|R
5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, <b>while</b> <b>women</b> would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E
5|$|<b>While</b> <b>women</b> {{worked in}} coal mines {{elsewhere}} in Britain, {{either on the}} surface or underground, bal maidens worked only on the surface. It is likely that Cornish women had worked in metal mining since antiquity, but the first records of female mine workers date from the 13thcentury. After the Black Death in the 14thcentury, mining declined, and no records of female workers have been found from then until the late 17thcentury. Industrial improvements, the end of Crown control of metal mines, and rising demand for raw materials caused a boom in Cornish mining in the late 17th and early 18thcenturies. Increasing numbers of women and girls were recruited to the mines from about 1720, processing ore sent up by the male miners underground. The discovery of cheaper sources of copper in North Wales in the 1770s triggered a crash in the copper price, and many mines closed.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of numerous Mahasatikals (or Mastikal – hero stones {{for a woman}} who accepted ritual death upon the demise of her husband) indicates the popularity of Sati among royalty. Ritual death by sallekhana and by jalasamadhi (drowning in water) were also practiced. Popular clothing among men was the use of two unrestricted garments, a Dhoti as a lower garment and a plain cloth as upper garment <b>while</b> <b>women</b> wore Saris with stitched petticoats. Turbans were popular with men of higher standing and people used umbrellas made with bamboo or reeds. Ornaments were popular among men and women and even elephants and horses were decorated. Men wore finger rings, necklaces (honnasara and honnagala sara), bracelets (Kaduga) and wristlets (Kaftkina). Women wore a nose jewel (bottu), nose ring (mugutti), bangles (bale or kankana) and various types of necklaces (honna gante sara and kati sutra). During leisure, men amused themselves with horse riding, watching wrestling bouts, cock fights and ram fights. There existed a large and well organised network of schools for imparting higher education and these schools were known by various names such as agraharas, ghatikas, brahmapura or matha. Inscriptions mention schools of higher education at Salotgi, Balligavi, Talagunda, Aihole, Arasikere and other places.|$|E
