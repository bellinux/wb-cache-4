50|$|Both {{sexual and}} asexual {{reproduction}}s <b>are</b> <b>implemented.</b> Asexual reproduction <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> as producing the offspring's genome (the gene network) by directly copying the parent's genome. Sexual reproduction <b>is</b> <b>implemented</b> as the recombination {{of the two}} parents' genomes.|$|R
5|$|A {{social control}} program was {{implemented}} whereby local unions took on responsibility for ensuring that this quota was not exceeded; in doing so, {{they hoped to}} remove the need for military and police intervention, and thus stem the violence of previous decades. Measures <b>were</b> <b>implemented</b> to ensure the industrialization of coca production, with Morales inaugurating the first coca industrialization plant in Chulumani, which produced and packaged coca and trimate tea; the project was primarily funded through a $125,000 donation from Venezuela under the PTA scheme.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 300 {{species of}} birds {{are found in the}} forest {{at least part of the}} year. Bald eagle, peregrine falcon, Swainson’s hawk and the prairie falcon are birds of prey that are relatively common. Waterfowl such as Western grebe, Northern pintail, Great blue heron and Barrow’s goldeneye have stable populations and rare sightings of Trumpeter swans are reported. pheasant, ruffed grouse and wild turkey are widely distributed across the open sage lands. Harlequin duck and northern goshawk are generally rare but management plans <b>were</b> <b>implemented</b> to protect various habitats these two species frequent to try and increase their population numbers.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the heavy security, {{businesses}} around the tower had seen decreased patronage due to less foot traffic around the heavily secured area. Protests around the tower subsided after his inauguration in January 2017, and by summer 2017, the security measures around the tower had been loosened somewhat, owing to the fact that most security measures <b>were</b> <b>implemented</b> only when Trump was actually in the tower. However, several businesses at the tower's base had closed by then because of a {{reduction in the number of}} customers.|$|E
50|$|Because {{digital systems}} {{need not be}} causal, some {{operations}} can <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> in the digital domain that cannot <b>be</b> <b>implemented</b> using discrete analog components.

5|$|Contrary {{to media}} reports and {{speculation}} at the time, the fires killed very few park animals— surveys indicated {{that only about}} 345 elk (of an estimated 40,000–50,000), 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, and 9 bison had perished. Changes in fire management policies <b>were</b> <b>implemented</b> by land management agencies throughout the United States, based on knowledge gained from the 1988 fires and the evaluation of scientists and experts from various fields. By 1992, Yellowstone had adopted a new fire management plan which observed stricter guidelines {{for the management of}} natural fires.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Lee Kuan Yew {{passed the}} reins of {{leadership}} to Goh Chok Tong, who became the second prime minister of Singapore. Goh presented a more open and consultative style of leadership as the country continued to modernize. In 1997, Singapore experienced {{the effect of the}} Asian financial crisis and tough measures, such as cuts in the CPF contribution, <b>were</b> <b>implemented.</b>|$|E
5|$|In April 2015 Polygon {{published}} an article describing the development process of Alan Wake 2 that started shortly after the first game released. Alan Wake 2 already had a working prototype and Remedy was prepared to pitch the game to Microsoft. However, according to Sam Lake, Remedy's founder, Microsoft wanted something else {{and development of the}} sequel has shifted to Quantum Break. Most of the ideas for Alan Wake 2 <b>were</b> <b>implemented</b> on American Nightmare. Like the game's location, the Arizona Desert.|$|E

5|$|In November 1982, Bahrain {{became the}} first customer. South Korea also {{explored}} local production of the F-20, and in support improvements <b>were</b> <b>implemented.</b> These included avionics upgrades, an expanded fuel tank, {{and the use of}} fibreglass composites. The changes were so extensive that a fourth prototype was built to test them. By 1983, Northrop was involved in a number of simultaneous negotiations for the F-20, and its prospects appeared positive.|$|E
5|$|Others {{were injured}} and their deaths years later may have {{resulted}} from their radiation exposure. With the end of World War II, the work to build additional nuclear devices was less urgent, and the accident halted work for a while until increased safety protocols <b>were</b> <b>implemented</b> at Los Alamos. The incident and its aftermath have been dramatized in several fictional and non-fiction accounts.|$|E
5|$|Several options <b>were</b> <b>implemented</b> to {{increase}} the bridge's lifespan. These included a dehumidification programme that slowed the rate of corrosion in the main cables by keeping air in the voids between the main cables' strands below 40% humidity. Engineering consultants Faber Maunsell began work on the project in 2006, which took {{two and a half}} years to complete at a cost of £7.8million. As part of the works, some of the corroded cable strands were spliced.|$|E

5|$|Texas won {{the game}} 52–17 and moved into {{first place in the}} Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings {{for the first time since}} they <b>were</b> <b>implemented</b> in 1998. The BCS formula took into account {{strength}} of schedule so that teams received more credit for beating stronger opponents. This allowed Texas to advance in the rankings since they beat an unbeaten team while University of Southern California, who previously held the numberone spot, beat Washington, a 1–6 team.|$|E
5|$|The first {{stone was}} laid down on 15 June 1670, {{and the initial}} stages of {{construction}} were supervised by Valperga himself. The fort received a skeleton garrison in June 1674, although it was still incomplete. In 1681, the Flemish engineer Carlos de Grunenbergh proposed some changes to the design of the fort, and these recommendations <b>were</b> <b>implemented.</b> The barracks, chapel and other buildings within the fort were constructed in the 1680s and 1690s, and the fort was officially declared complete and armed in May 1698.|$|E
5|$|These {{and other}} major changes brought about major defections among ministers and members, which in turn contributed to a further drop in church revenue. In order to bring the {{finances}} in order, {{major changes in the}} church infrastructure <b>were</b> <b>implemented.</b> The World Tomorrow, which had seen record numbers of viewers {{in the early years of}} the Tkach administration, was stopped. The Plain Truth publication runs were reduced. Staff at the church headquarters were laid off. The famous, church-subsidized Ambassador Auditorium concert series was canceled and offers were sought for the purchase of the Ambassador College Pasadena campus.|$|E
50|$|In South Africa, {{the main}} model of Land Reforms that <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> <b>was</b> {{based on the}} Market-led Agrarian Reform (MLAR) approach. Within the MLAR, the {{strategic}} partnership (SP) model <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> in seven claimant communities in Levubu in the Limpopo province. The SP model <b>was</b> <b>implemented</b> between 2005-2008 that {{ended up in a}} fiasco leading to creation of conflict between several interested parties.|$|R

5|$|Three {{programs}} were {{written for the}} computer. The first, consisting of 17instructions, was written by Kilburn, and so far as can be ascertained first ran on 21 June 1948. It was designed to find the highest proper factor of 218 (262,144) by trying every integer from 218−1 downwards. The divisions <b>were</b> <b>implemented</b> by repeated subtractions of the divisor. The SSEM took 3.5million operations and 52minutes to produce the answer (131,072). The program used eight words of working storage {{in addition to its}} 17words of instructions, giving a program size of 25words.|$|E
5|$|To fit {{the program}} into the 320 words {{available}} on the chip, some significant modification was used. By not using regular floating point numbers, which require lots of instructions to keep the decimal point in the right place, some space was freed up. Trigonometric functions <b>were</b> <b>implemented</b> in about 40 instructions, and inverse trigonometric functions are almost 30 more instructions. Logarithms are about 40 instructions, with anti-log about 20 on top of that. The code to normalize and display the computed values are roughly the same in both the TI and Sinclair programs.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fall}} of Diệm, various American {{sanctions}} that <b>were</b> <b>implemented</b> against South Vietnam {{in response to the}} repression of the Buddhist crisis and Nhu's Special Forces' Xá Lợi Pagoda raids, were lifted. The freeze on U.S. economic aid, the suspension of the Commercial Import Program and various capital works initiatives were lifted. The United States quickly moved to recognise Thơ and Minh.|$|E
