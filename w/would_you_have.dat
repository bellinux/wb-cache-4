2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the campaign, Dion had an {{interview}} with CTV Halifax's anchor Steve Murphy, where Dion asked the host three times to restart the interview because he didn't understand the mixed tense and timing of a question about the economy: [...] "If you were Prime Minister now, what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done about the economy and this crisis that Mr. Harper has not done?" [...] Murphy initially agreed not to air it but network executives decided to release it, generating controversy.

2500|$|On 27 August 2006, Nasrallah denied in an {{interview}} with New TV that the capture of the two soldiers was the cause of the war. It only advanced a long planned war for a few months. But he added: [...] "If there was even a 1 percent chance that the July 11 capturing operation would have led to a war like the one that happened, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done it? I would say no, absolutely not, for humanitarian, moral, social, security, military, and political reasons. [...] What happened is not an issue of a reaction to a capturing operation… what happened was already planned for. The fact that it happened in July has averted a situation {{that would have been a}} lot worse, had the war been launched in October." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since these criticisms are {{concerned}} {{not with the}} validity of the Wager itself, but with its possible aftermath—namely that a person who has been convinced of the overwhelming odds in favor of belief might still find himself unable to sincerely believe—they are tangential to the thrust of the Wager. What such critics are objecting to is Pascal's subsequent advice to an unbeliever who, having concluded that the only rational way to wager is in favor of God's existence, points out, reasonably enough, that this by no means makes him a believer. This hypothetical unbeliever complains, [...] "I am so made that I cannot believe. What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> me do?" [...] Pascal, far from suggesting that God can be deceived by outward show, says that God does not regard it at all: [...] "God looks only at what is inward." [...] For a person who is already convinced of the odds of the Wager but cannot seem to put his heart into the belief, he offers practical advice.|$|E
2500|$|When {{she breaks}} with German {{practice}} and asks the judge at her trial [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done?" [...] {{about whether she}} should have left her job at Siemens and taken the guard position, her question indicates {{that she does not}} know that she could have acted differently, and her statement that there was [...] "no alternative" [...] claims a lack of moral responsibility. As a result of her shame at being illiterate, she has not only let the bulk of the crime be pinned on her, she has let those with a greater share of responsibility escape full accountability. Franklin writes that this is the moral center of the novel—that Hanna, as Michael puts it, chooses exposure as a criminal over exposure as an illiterate—and in Franklin's view the novel cannot recover from the weakness of this position. Franklin regards it not only as implausible, but the implication that Hanna chose the job and acted as she did because of her illiteracy appears intended to exonerate her. Her Nazism was accidental, and Franklin writes that Schlink offers no guidance about how to punish a brutality of convenience, rather than of ideology.|$|E

2500|$|The footage shows {{interviewer}} Steve Murphy asking Dion the question: [...] "If {{you were}} the Prime Minister now, what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done about the economy, and this crisis, that Mr. Harper has not done?". [...] Dion had difficulty in understanding the question, repeatedly asking Murphy to clarify if he meant if Dion was Prime Minister now, next Tuesday on election day, last week, last month, 60 weeks ago, or {{two and a half}} years ago. [...] Eventually, after three start overs to the interview, Dion responded with what he would do if elected Prime Minister in the future. CTV initially agreed to restart the interviews and not air the false starts but changed their minds and announced that they felt it was their responsibility to show it. Harper responded to the clips by saying that [...] "When you're running a trillion-and-a-half-dollar economy you don't get a chance to have do-overs, over and over again" [...] and [...] "What this incident actually indicates very clearly is Mr. Dion and the Liberal Party really don't know what they would do on the economy", and when told that the difficulties were in part due to English being Dion's second language, Harper said: [...] "I don't think this is a question of language at all. The question was very clear. It was asked repeatedly".|$|E
