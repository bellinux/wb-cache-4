5|$|In {{addition}} to copying and restoring portraits, the serjeant-painters also undertook decorative tasks, {{such as the}} painting of banners and stage scenery. Parchment rolls of the Office of the Works record that De Critz oversaw the decorating of royal houses and palaces. Since Peake’s <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> recorded there, {{it seems as if}} De Critz took responsibility for the more decorative tasks, while Peake continued his work as a royal portrait painter. However, Peake and Paul Isackson painted the cabins, carvings, and armorials on the ship the Prince Royal in 1611.|$|E
5|$|In his {{published}} score Monteverdi lists around 41 {{instruments to}} be deployed, with distinct groups of instruments used to depict particular scenes and characters. Thus strings, harpsichords and recorders represent the pastoral fields of Thrace with their nymphs and shepherds, while heavy brass illustrates the underworld and its denizens. Composed {{at the point}} of transition from the Renaissance era to the Baroque, L'Orfeo employs all the resources then known within the art of music, with particularly daring use of polyphony. The <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> orchestrated as such; in the Renaissance tradition instrumentalists followed the composer's general instructions but were given considerable freedom to improvise.|$|E
5|$|Jabba the Hutt only speaks Huttese on film, but {{his lines}} are subtitled in English. His voice and Huttese-language {{dialogue}} were performed by voice actor Larry Ward, whose <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{listed in the}} end credits. A heavy, booming quality was given to Ward's voice by pitching it an octave lower than normal and processing it through a subharmonic generator. A soundtrack of wet, slimy sound effects was recorded to accompany {{the movement of the}} puppet's limbs and mouth.|$|E

5|$|The design—effectively a {{frame for}} two scenes {{depicted}} through Rayner Hoff's marble reliefs and bronze statues—shows the prelude and the epilogue to war, depicting both {{the willingness of}} youth to answer {{the call of duty}} and the extent of the sacrifices which they made. In this, the <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> displaying a material victory, but instead a victory of the spirit. At the insistence of W. F. J. McCann, president of the Returned Soldiers' League, bronze tablets were cast to line the walls of an inner shrine, on which are listed the names of all South Australians who died during the Great War.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominations}} for the award are received from various literary experts, teachers, critics, universities, and numerous literary and language associations. Every three years, {{an advisory committee}} is constituted {{for each of the}} languages. The language of the most recent recipient's <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> eligible for consideration for the next two years. Each committee consists of three literary critics and scholars of their respective languages. All the nominations are scrutinised by the committee and their recommendations are submitted to the Jnanpith Award Selection Board (Pravara Parishad).|$|E
5|$|Writer Ed Burns, {{who worked}} as a public school teacher after {{retiring}} from the Baltimore police force shortly before going to work with Simon, has called education the theme of the fourth season. Rather than focusing solely on the school system, the fourth season looks at schools as a porous part of the community that are affected by problems outside of their boundaries. Burns states that education comes from many sources other than schools and that children can be educated by other means, including contact with the drug dealers they work for. Burns and Simon see the theme as an opportunity to explore how individuals end up like the show's criminal characters, and to dramatize the notion that hard <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> always justly rewarded.|$|E

5|$|Entering {{college at}} the age of 18 Hsing discovers that 4-Hiroshi Canaval, the teacher of Navigation, has asked her to be placed {{directly}} into the second-year navigation course. Hsing shows an aptitude for the subject, and in her third year chooses to make it her profession. Luis chooses to become a doctor, and their academic separation leads to Hsing and Luis slowly drawing apart from one another. Hsing finds herself attracted to Hiroshi, and the two begin a romantic relationship. Three days after their wedding Hiroshi tells Hsing that the focus of his life's <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> simply navigation, as is generally believed, but concealing a secret {{from the rest of the}} ship. A few years earlier an unexpected gravitational effect led to the ship experiencing a vast acceleration, putting it 40 years ahead of schedule; it is expected to arrive at Hsin Ti Chiu in five years.|$|E
5|$|The <b>work</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a law code {{issued by}} King Henry, but a {{compilation}} of already extant legislation that was still current during his reign. It is not a comprehensive listing of all laws that were in force during the early 11th century. It begins with Henry's Charter of Liberties, which he issued after his coronation, {{and this is the}} only actual legal document reproduced in the Leges. Some discussions of juridical matters then follow, then a long treatment of ecclesiastical issues. The rest of the treatise is concerned with non-ecclesiastical subjects, including cases of injury, theft, murder, and feuds. Procedural topics are included, such as how summonses to court should be formed, what notices need to be made before judicial procedures, how adjournments should be handled, and other such concerns. There is no strong organizational framework to the entirety of the Leges, which leads the author to repeat subjects as well as treating some subjects less than adequately.|$|E
