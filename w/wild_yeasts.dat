5|$|Lambic, a beer of Belgium, is {{naturally}} fermented using <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts,</b> rather than cultivated. Many {{of these are}} not strains of brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness. Yeast varieties such as Brettanomyces bruxellensis and Brettanomyces lambicus are common in lambics. In addition, other organisms such as Lactobacillus bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness.|$|E
25|$|While some rum {{producers}} allow <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> {{to perform}} the fermentation, most use specific strains of yeast to help provide a consistent taste and predictable fermentation time.|$|E
25|$|Lambic {{is a type}} of beer brewed in the Pajottenland {{region of}} Belgium {{southwest}} of Brussels and in Brussels itself at the Cantillon Brewery. Lambic beers include gueuze and kriek lambic. Lambic differs from most other beers in that it is fermented through exposure to <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> and bacteria native to the Zenne valley, as opposed to exposure to carefully cultivated strains of brewer's yeast. This process gives the beer its distinctive flavour: dry, , and cidery, usually with a sour aftertaste.|$|E
5000|$|At one time, all beers were sour to some degree. As pure yeast {{cultures}} {{were not}} available, the starter used from one batch to another usually contained some <b>wild</b> <b>yeast</b> and bacteria. Unlike modern brewing, which {{is done in}} a sterile environment to guard against the intrusion of <b>wild</b> <b>yeast,</b> sour beers are made by intentionally allowing <b>wild</b> <b>yeast</b> strains or bacteria into the brew. Traditionally, Belgian brewers allowed <b>wild</b> <b>yeast</b> to enter the brew naturally through the barrels or during the cooling of the wort in a coolship open to the outside air [...] - an unpredictable process that many modern brewers avoid.|$|R

25|$|In some sectors brewers are {{reluctant}} to embrace new technology for fear of losing the traditional characteristics of their beer. For example, Marston's Brewery in Burton on Trent still uses open wooden Burton Union sets for fermentation {{in order to maintain}} the quality and flavour of its beers, while Belgium's lambic brewers go so far as to expose their brews to outside air in order to pick up the natural <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> which ferment the wort. Traditional brewing techniques protect the beer from oxidation by maintaining a carbon dioxide blanket over the wort as it ferments into beer.|$|E
25|$|As {{almost any}} cereal {{containing}} certain sugars can undergo spontaneous fermentation due to <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> in the air, {{it is possible}} that beer-like beverages were independently developed throughout the world soon after a tribe or culture had domesticated cereal. Chemical tests of ancient pottery jars reveal that beer was produced about 3,500 BC in what is today Iran, {{and was one of the}} first-known biological engineering tasks where the biological process of fermentation is used. Also, archaeological findings show that Chinese villagers were brewing fermented alcoholic drinks as far back as 7000 BC on small and individual scale, with the production process and methods similar to that of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.|$|E
25|$|For {{hundreds}} of years the English ancestors of the colonists had consumed beer and ale. Both in England and in the New World, people of both sexes and all ages typically drank beer with their meals. Because importing a continuing supply of beer was expensive, the early settlers brewed their own. However, {{it was difficult to}} make the beer they were accustomed to because <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> caused problems in fermentation and resulted in a bitter, unappetizing brew. Although wild hops grew in New England, hop seeds were ordered from England in order to cultivate an adequate supply for traditional beer. In the meantime, the colonists improvised a beer made from red and black spruce twigs boiled in water, as well as a ginger beer.|$|E
50|$|Belgian Lambic is {{also made}} with wheat and barley, but differs from nearly all beers {{in the use}} of <b>wild</b> <b>yeast</b> for {{spontaneous}} fermentation.|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{uncertainty}} involved in using <b>wild</b> <b>yeast,</b> the sour beer brewing process is extremely unpredictable. The beer takes months to ferment and can take years to mature.|$|R
25|$|As {{almost any}} cereal {{containing}} certain sugars can undergo spontaneous fermentation due to <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> in the air, {{it is possible}} that beer-like beverages were independently developed throughout the world soon after a tribe or culture had domesticated cereal. Chemical tests of ancient pottery jars reveal that beer was produced as far back as about 7,000 years ago in what is today Iran. This discovery reveals one of the earliest known uses of fermentation and is the earliest evidence of brewing to date. In Mesopotamia, the oldest evidence of beer is believed to be a 6,000-year-old Sumerian tablet depicting people drinking a beverage through reed straws from a communal bowl. A 3900-year-old Sumerian poem honouring Ninkasi, the patron goddess of brewing, contains the oldest surviving beer recipe, describing the production of beer from barley via bread. In China, residue on pottery dating from between 5400 and 4900 years ago shows beer was brewed using barley and other grains.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the [...] "ambient" [...] Saccharomyces wild yeast, these genera of <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> {{have very}} low {{tolerance}} to both alcohol and sulfur dioxide. They {{are capable of}} starting a fermentation and often begin this process {{as early as the}} harvest bin when clusters of grapes get slightly crushed under their own weight. Some winemakers will try to [...] "knock out" [...] these yeasts with doses of sulfur dioxide, most often at the crusher before the grapes are pressed or allowed to macerate with skin contact. Other winemakers may allow the <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> to continue fermenting until they succumb to the toxicity of the alcohol they produce which is often between 3–5% alcohol by volume and then letting either inoculated or [...] "ambient" [...] Saccharomyces strains finish the fermentation.|$|E
2500|$|Another use of {{the term}} [...] "wild yeast" [...] refers to the non-Saccharomyces genera of yeasts that are present in the {{vineyard}}, on the surface of grapevines and of the grapes themselves. Anywhere from 160 to 100,000 colony forming units of <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> per berry could exist in a typical vineyard. These yeasts can be carried by air currents, birds and insects through the vineyard and even into the winery (such as by [...] ). The most common <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> found in the vineyard are from the genera Kloeckera, Candida and Pichia with the species Kloeckera apiculata being the most dominant species by far. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, itself, is actually quite rarely found in the vineyard or on the surface freshly harvested wine grapes unless the winery frequently reintroduced winery waste (such as lees and pomace) into the vineyard.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to the use}} of <b>wild</b> <b>yeast,</b> some beer batches can go bad: in late 2011, Jester King {{recalled}} a batch of its Commercial Suicide beer due to excessive gushing caused by over carbonation.|$|R
2500|$|Growth of many {{unfavorable}} <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> {{is generally}} slowed at lower cellar temperatures, so many winemakers {{who wish to}} inhibit the activities of these yeasts before the more favorable Saccharomyces yeast kick in, will often chill their must, such as the practice of [...] "cold soaking" [...] the must during a pre-fermentation maceration at temperatures between 4–15°C (39–50°F). Though some species, such as Brettanomyces, will not be inhibited and may even thrive during {{an extended period of}} cold soaking.|$|E
2500|$|In winemaking, {{there are}} distinctions made between ambient yeasts which are {{naturally}} present in wine cellars, vineyards {{and on the}} grapes themselves (sometimes known as a grape's [...] "bloom" [...] or [...] "blush") and cultured yeast which are specifically isolated and inoculated for use in winemaking. The most common genera of <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> found in winemaking include Candida, Klöckera/Hanseniaspora, Metschnikowiaceae, Pichia and Zygosaccharomyces. <b>Wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> can produce high-quality, unique-flavored wines; however, they are often unpredictable and may introduce less desirable traits to the wine, and can even contribute to spoilage. It {{should be noted that}} few yeast, and lactic and acetic acid bacterial colonies naturally live on the surface of grapes, but traditional wine makers, particularly in Europe, advocate use of ambient yeast as a characteristic of the region's terroir; nevertheless, many winemakers prefer to control fermentation with predictable cultured yeast. The cultured yeasts most commonly used in winemaking belong to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (also known as [...] "sugar yeast") species. Within this species are several hundred different strains of yeast that can be used during fermentation to affect the heat or vigor of the process and enhance or suppress certain flavor characteristics of the varietal. The use of different strains of yeasts is a major contributor to the diversity of wine, even among the same grape variety. Alternative, non-Saccharomyces cerevisiae, yeasts are being used more prevalently in the industry to add greater complexity to wine. After a winery has been in operation for a number of years, few yeast strains are actively involved in the fermentation process. The use of active dry yeasts reduces the variety of strains that appear in spontaneous fermentation by outcompeting those strains that are naturally present.|$|E
2500|$|The use of both [...] "ambient" [...] and non-Saccharomyces <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> carries both {{potential}} benefits and risk. Some winemakers {{feel that the}} use of resident/indigenous yeast helps contribute to the unique expression of terroir in the wine. In wine regions such as Bordeaux, classified and highly regarded estates will often tout the quality of their resident [...] "chateau" [...] strains. To this extent, wineries will often take the leftover pomace and lees from winemaking and return them to the vineyard to be used as compost in order to encourage the sustained presence of favorable strains. [...] But compared to inoculated yeast, these ambient yeasts hold the risk of having a more unpredictable fermentation. Not only could this unpredictability include the presence of off-flavors/aromas and higher volatile acidity but also the potential for a stuck fermentation if the indigenous yeast strains are not vigorous enough to fully convert all the sugars.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the {{composition}} of "cachaças" produced in 10 fermentation cycles by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) and <b>wild</b> <b>yeast</b> strains [Pichia silvicola (Ps), Pichia anomala 1 (Pa 1), Pichia anomala 2 (Pa 2) and Dekkera bruxelensis (Db) ], isolated from distilleries in Jaboticabal - SP, Brazil. The secondary components of the heart fraction were determined by gas chromatography. The levels of secondary components were influenced by the wine pH, which varied among yeast strains. S. cerevisiae showed slightly more secondary components, whereas wild strains produced more higher alcohols. <b>Wild</b> <b>yeast</b> strains were shown to be adequate for the production of a high quality "cachaça"...|$|R
5000|$|Sourdough bread traces {{its origins}} to ancient Egypt and {{is common in}} parts of Europe. It became a staple in San Francisco during the California Gold Rush of 1849. [...] Gold miners valued it for their camps because of its durability, and the {{relative}} ease of obtaining yeast. Although {{many different kinds of}} pre-ferment (a dough-like mixture of fermented flour and water containing bacteria and <b>wild</b> <b>yeast)</b> are suitable for making sourdough, specific species of bacteria (Lactobacillus sanfrancisco) and <b>wild</b> <b>yeast</b> (Candida humilis) have been identified as the predominant cultures in local breads. Sourdough starters were carefully kept and maintained by each bakery as a [...] "mother sponge".|$|R
2500|$|In winemaking, {{the term}} [...] "wild yeast" [...] has {{multiple}} meanings. In {{its most basic}} context, it refers to yeast {{that has not been}} introduced to the must by intentional inoculation of a cultured strain. Instead, these [...] "wild yeasts" [...] often come into contact with the must through their presence on harvest equipment, transport bins, the surface winemaking equipment and as part of the natural flora of a winery. Very often these are strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that have taken residence in these places over the years, sometimes being previously introduced by inoculation of prior vintages. In this context, these <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> are often referred to as ambient, indigenous or natural yeast as opposed to inoculated, selected or cultured yeast. Wineries that often solely rely on these [...] "in-house" [...] strains will sometimes market their wines as being the product of wild or natural fermentations. The (c. 304) Nanfang Caomu Zhuang has the earliest description of winemaking using [...] "herb ferment" [...] (cǎoqū 草麴) wild yeast with rice and various herbs, including the poisonous Gelsemium elegans (yěgé 冶葛).|$|E
50|$|Beers of {{spontaneous}} fermentation use <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> rather than cultivated ones. By the Middle Ages, brewers {{had learned to}} crop the yeast from one brew and use it in the next. Only in a few isolated regions were <b>wild</b> <b>yeasts</b> still used. The best-known region where spontaneous fermentation is still used is the Senne Valley in Belgium where lambic is produced.|$|E
