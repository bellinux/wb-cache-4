It is {{under the control of}} the Port of San Diego and contains hotels, restaurants, marinas, and public parkland.|$|E
5|$|Denmark Street is {{a street}} {{on the edge}} of London's West End running from Charing Cross Road to St Giles High Street.

Since the 1950s it has been {{associated}} with British popular music, first via publishers and later by recording studios and music shops.

5|$|In 1963, J. Alan Robinson had {{discovered}} a simple method to implement deduction on computers, the resolution and unification algorithm. However, straightforward implementations, like those attempted by McCarthy and his students in the late 60s, were especially intractable: the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems. A more fruitful approach to logic <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s by Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh, and soon {{this led to the}} collaboration with French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel who created the successful logic programming language Prolog.|$|E
5|$|In the end, {{air superiority}} and {{command of the}} sea allowed the Allies to heavily {{reinforce}} their position on Los Negros. The 1st Cavalry Division could then overrun the islands. The campaign officially ended on 18May 1944. The Allied victory completed {{the isolation of the}} major Japanese base at Rabaul that was the ultimate objective of the Allied campaigns of 1942 and 1943. A major air and naval base <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Admiralty Islands that became an important launching point for the campaigns of 1944 in the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 2nd century in North Africa, a {{distinctive}} type of nozzle tube shape <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tradition of the terracotta tube dome at the Hellenistic era baths of Morgantina, an idea that had been preserved in the use of interlocking terracotta pots for kiln roofs. This tube could be mass-produced on potter's wheels and interlocked to form a permanent centering for concrete domes, avoiding the use of wooden centering altogether. This spread mainly in the western Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|The Antonov An-70 (-70) is a four-engine medium-range {{transport}} aircraft, and {{the first}} aircraft to take flight powered only by propfan engines. It <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1980s by the Antonov Design Bureau to replace the obsolete An-12 military transport aircraft. The maiden flight of the first prototype took place in December 1994 in Kiev, now-independent Ukraine. Within months the prototype had suffered a mid-air collision. A second airframe was produced to allow the flight-test programme to proceed. Both prototypes were produced by the Kiev Aircraft Production Plant.|$|E

5|$|The College {{buildings}} {{were used as}} a farm into the 19th century, until the expansion of Maidstone led to their demolition as the neighbouring area was developed.

The buildings are currently owned by Maidstone Borough Council having been donated to the borough by Sir Garrard Tyrwhitt-Drake, mayor of the borough in 1949–50. A plaque commemorating the presentation is fixed inside the archway of the Gatehouse.|$|E
5|$|The International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP) is {{a two-year}} {{educational}} programme primarily aimed at 16 to 18 year olds.

It <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early to mid-1960s in Geneva, Switzerland, {{by a group of}} international educators. After a six-year pilot programme ended in 1975, a bilingual diploma was established.|$|E
5|$|The inverse {{square root}} of a {{floating}} point number {{is used in}} calculating a normalized vector. Programs can use normalized vectors to determine angles of incidence and reflection. 3D graphics programs must perform millions of these calculations every second to simulate lighting. When the code <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1990s, most floating-point processing power lagged behind the speed of integer processing. This was troublesome for 3D graphics programs {{before the advent of}} specialized hardware to handle transform and lighting.|$|E

5|$|Weber's {{methodology}} <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{context of}} a wider debate about methodology of social sciences, the Methodenstreit. Weber's position was close to historicism, as he understood social actions as being heavily tied to particular historical contexts and its analysis required the understanding of subjective motivations of individuals (social actors). Thus Weber's methodology emphasises the use of comparative historical analysis. Therefore, Weber {{was more interested in}} explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting an outcome of those processes in the future.|$|E
5|$|As of 1 January 2014, Esbjerg has a {{population}} of 71,618, making it the fifth-largest city in Denmark, and the largest in west Jutland. Until the harbour <b>was</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1860s, the area was sparsely inhabited with just a few farms. Thereafter, it grew rapidly: by 1880, there were some 1,500 inhabitants, rising to some 13,000 by 1901 when it was already larger than neighbouring Varde and Ribe. By the end of the 1950s, with almost 60,000 inhabitants, it had become Denmark's fifth-largest city. By 1970, Esbjerg had seen a fivefold increase in population since 1901, reaching some 70,000. After 1970, the increase in population slowed, reaching a maximum of 18,023 in 1998.|$|E
