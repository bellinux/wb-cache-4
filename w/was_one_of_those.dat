5|$|Alice Grey {{was accused}} with Katherine Hewitt {{of the murder}} of Anne Foulds. Potts does not provide an account of Alice Grey's trial, simply {{recording}} her as one of the Samlesbury witches – which she was not, as she <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> identified as having been at the Malkin Tower meeting – and naming her in the list of those found not guilty.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1590s, the full-length portrait came into vogue and artistic patrons among the nobles began to add galleries of such paintings to their homes as a form of cultural ostentation. Peake <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who met the demand. He was also among the earliest English painters to explore the full-length individual or group portrait with active figures placed in a natural landscape, a style of painting that became fashionable in England. As principal painter to Prince Henry, Peake seems to have been charged with showing his patron as a dashing young warrior.|$|E
5|$|Chesney's acta, or documents, contain many {{examples}} of him settling judicial disputes, demonstrating how active {{he was in his}} diocese. More than 240 of his acta have survived, many of them concerning the religious houses within his jurisdiction. Chesney was appointed a papal judge-delegate at least once, and it was in his court that the case of Philip de Broy, a canon in Bedfordshire accused of murdering a knight, was heard. The case <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> that contributed to King Henry's determination that criminous clerks should be subject to royal justice, not just ecclesiastical justice.|$|E

5|$|In 1860, he <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{politicians}} who forced Prime Minister and Minister of Colonial Affairs Jan Jacob Rochussen, his former Governor-General, to resign his post, {{in part because}} a corruption scandal in the East Indies came to light. In that same year he promoted his friend Multatuli's Max Havelaar, announcing in parliament that the book had sent tremors through the country. On 1 July 1862, he {{was appointed to the}} Council of State of the Netherlands, where he served until his death in The Hague on 10 February 1879. His wife died on 9 January 1888.|$|E

The restaurant <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> run by Ramsay that he imposed a smoking ban in from 2004 onwards.|$|E
5|$|On 7January 1830 Etty's mentor Thomas Lawrence died, {{followed}} on 30July by Etty's mother. Etty {{was devastated}} by the loss, and <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> considered to replace Lawrence as President of the Royal Academy, although in the event he did not stand for election. Possibly distracted {{by the death of}} Lawrence, Etty only submitted three paintings to the Summer Exhibition that year. One of these, Judith Going Forth, was an addition to Judith, which had been commissioned the previous year by that painting's new owners, the Royal Scottish Academy.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian {{government}} attacked JNA garrisons {{and arms}} depots {{throughout the country}} on 14 September– an offensive dubbed the Battle of the Barracks. Vukovar's JNA barracks <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> attacked that day, but the JNA managed to defend it. In retaliation, Serb paramilitaries attacked areas to the southwest of Vukovar {{from the direction of}} Negoslavci, forcing about 2,000 people to flee. There were reports of mass killings and scores of civilian deaths. Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter received large quantities of arms and ammunition from depots captured elsewhere, enabling them to hold the line against JNA attacks.|$|E
5|$|The Mafia only became {{credible}} {{again after}} the end of the invasion. The Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories (AMGOT), looking for anti-fascist notables to replace fascist authorities, made Don Calogero Vizzini mayor of Villalba, as well as an Honorary Colonel of the US Army. In the chaos that followed the invasion of Sicily and the collapse of Fascism, the American army often relied on senior churchmen for advice on whom to trust. Don Calò <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> recommended. He had a long record of involvement with Catholic social funds and there were several clergymen in his family.|$|E
5|$|The {{financial}} {{ties and}} inheritance issues within {{the immediate and}} extended family added a layer of complexity to the case. Bamber's parents' estate included land and buildings occupied by Bamber's cousins, who were made aware, after the murders, that Bamber intended to sell them. It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> cousins who found the silencer in the gun cupboard after the murders, with the flecks of blood and paint that proved pivotal to the prosecution.|$|E

The rebuilt hall was designed by Edward Maufe, and was formally opened in 1951 by the Duke of Gloucester.|$|E
5|$|After this, Newcastle {{would have}} one more chance to {{progress}} in the Champions League in early 2003, but Shearer <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who failed to score as the team were eliminated in a penalty shootout by Partizan Belgrade in the third qualifying round. United progressed well in that season's UEFA Cup and Shearer's six goals helped the club reach the semi-finals, where they were beaten by eventual runners up Olympique de Marseille. Domestically {{he also had a}} good season, with 22goals in 37appearances, however could not prevent the club dropping out of the Champions League places to finish in fifth, qualifying once again for the UEFA Cup.|$|E
5|$|Although Æthelred {{had been}} Eardwulf's enemy, Æthelred's killers {{proved to be}} equally hostile to Eardwulf. In 798 a dux named Wada, who <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who had killed King Æthelred, fought with Eardwulf on Billington Moor, near Whalley, Lancashire. Wada was put to flight and may have gone into exile in Mercia. He may have hoped to restore Osbald to the throne. The {{evidence}} for Osbald's continued ambition is a letter that Alcuin wrote to him, probably in 798, in which Alcuin attempted to dissuade Osbald from further interventions in Northumbrian affairs. Alcuin's arguments appear to have succeeded, since Osbald {{is known to have}} become an abbot by 799 (when his death is recorded), implying that he had given up his ambitions.|$|E

5|$|Angus died at Tantallon in January 1557, and {{the castle}} {{was seized by}} the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise. It was given over to the Laird of Craigmillar, and repairs were carried out the {{following}} year. In 1558, George Drummond of Blair was keeper of Tantallon, with a garrison of seven horsemen and 22 soldiers. James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton took control in 1565, {{on behalf of his}} nephew, the young 8th Earl of Angus, but the following year, Mary, Queen of Scots, gave the Captaincy to Robert Lauder of the Bass, and his son, Robert Lauder, younger of the Bass The appointment of the Lauders followed the surrender of Sir William Douglas of Lochleven, who <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> charged with the murder of Queen Mary's favourite, David Rizzio, in March 1566. Mary visited Tantallon herself in November 1566. The Yester Writs record an Andrew Hume as Captain of Tantallon Castle in 1577. Following the death of the 8th Earl in 1588, the Earls of Angus lived elsewhere, and {{had little to do with}} Tantallon Castle.|$|E
5|$|Based only on {{uncertain}} {{descriptions of}} the first practical telescope which Hans Lippershey tried to patent in the Netherlands in 1608, Galileo, in the following year, made a telescope with about 3x magnification. He later made improved versions with up to about 30x magnification. With a Galilean telescope, the observer could see magnified, upright images on the earth—it was what {{is commonly known as}} a terrestrial telescope or a spyglass. He could also use it to observe the sky; for a time he <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose. On 25 August 1609, he demonstrated one of his early telescopes, with a magnification of about 8 or 9, to Venetian lawmakers. His telescopes were also a profitable sideline for Galileo, who sold them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade. He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief treatise entitled Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger).|$|E
5|$|Claude Ewing Rusk, a local settler and mountaineer, <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> most {{familiar}} with Adams {{and he was}} instrumental {{in many of the}} names given to places around the mountain. In 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of the mountain and explored, to some extent, all ten of its principle glaciers. This was the first recorded circuit of Adams by a woman and likely the first recorded circuit by anyone. While they were on the east side, they named Avalanche Valley. Later, in 1897, after they had completed an ascent of Adams, they went to the Ridge of Wonders and his mother, awestruck by the scene, named it as such.|$|E
