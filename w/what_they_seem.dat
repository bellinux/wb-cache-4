During Chasing Vermeer, Charles Fort's book, Lo!, inspires the {{children}} to list {{and pay attention to}} coincidences as they realize that they are more than <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> and explore the concept that they make up one unexplained pattern. Balliett stated that she wanted to convey how coincidences were noticeable and felt meaningful, and how they could matter even if they were unexplainable.|$|E
5|$|In A Dance with Dragons (2011), Tyrion {{travels to}} Pentos, where {{he finds himself}} under the {{protection}} of wealthy Magister Illyrio Mopatis. There he learns that Varys and Illyrio have secretly plotted to return the Targaryens to power since the murder of the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen. On Illyrio's advice, Tyrion decides to seek out and join Aerys' surviving daughter Daenerys at Meereen and help her reclaim the Iron Throne. He eventually realizes that two of his traveling companions are not <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem.</b> One is Jon Connington, disgraced former Hand of the King; the other claims to be Aegon VI Targaryen, Aerys' grandson, whom Varys had spirited away and replaced with another baby that was then killed during the Lannisters' sack of King's Landing. While in Volantis, Tyrion visits a brothel and is recognized and captured by Jorah Mormont who believes that delivering a Lannister to Daenerys will return Jorah to her good graces. Before they can reach Meereen, they are captured by the slavers currently besieging the city. When a plague strikes the slaver's siege camps, Tyrion engineers their escape by joining a mercenary company, the Second Sons. In exchange for membership, Tyrion promises the company the wealth of the Lannister ancestral seat of Casterly Rock, his birthright since Tywin is dead and Jaime has renounced it. Tyrion quickly realizes the slavers are on the losing side, and attempts to convince the Second Sons to change their allegiance.|$|E

She went on to compose and star in four more full length operettas which were staged in either Boston, Massachusetts or Providence, Rhode Island between 1880–1896, including Fun At A Boarding School, and Love In Disguise; or, Things Are Not <b>What</b> <b>They</b> <b>Seem.</b> None of her works survive.|$|E

500|$|The episode's main antagonist, {{the field}} mushroom, {{was met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews from critics, with a few detractors. Connie Ogle from PopMatters ranked the [...] "giant underground mushroom thingie" [...] among the [...] "best" [...] monster-of-the-week, describing it as [...] "too crafty to end up on a pizza". Timothy Sexton from Yahoo! Voices named [...] "The Giant Mushroom" [...] as one of [...] "The Best X-Files Monsters of the Week", writing, [...] "In the X-Files episode Field Trip things are simply not <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem.</b> [...] But when I claim that a giant mushroom {{is one of the}} most memorable X-Files monsters of the week, you can bet I'm being serious". Not all reviews were so positive. Cyriaque Lamar from i09 called the mushroom one of [...] "The 10 Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters" [...] and wrote, [...] "Mulder and Scully conquer this mycological nightmare by jointly fighting it during a drug trip — some real astral plane shit, brah. Love the 1990s CGI".|$|E
500|$|The English {{tradition}} of semi-opera, to which The Fairy-Queen belongs, demanded {{that most of}} the music within the play be introduced through the agency of supernatural beings, the exception being pastoral or drunken characters. All the masques in The Fairy-Queen are presented by Titania or Oberon. Originally Act I contained no music, but due to the work's enormous success it was revived in 1693, when Purcell added the scene of the Drunken Poet and two further songs later on in the work; [...] "Ye gentle spirits of the air" [...] and [...] "The Plaint". As noted above, each masque is subtly related to the action in the play during that particular act in a metaphorical way. In this manner we have Night and Sleep in Act II, which is apt as that act of the play consists of Oberon's plans to use the power of the [...] "love-in-idleness" [...] flower to confuse various loves, and it is therefore appropriate for the allegorical figures of Secrecy, Mystery et al. to [...] usher in a night of enchantment. The masque for Bottom in Act III includes metamorphoses, songs of both real and feigned love, and beings who are not <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem.</b> The Reconciliation masque between Oberon and Titania at the end of Act IV prefigures the final masque. The scene changes to a Garden of Fountains, denoting King William's hobby, just after Oberon says [...] "bless these Lovers' Nuptial Day". The Four Seasons tell us that the marriage here celebrated is a good one all year round and [...] "All Salute the rising Sun"/...The Birthday of King Oberon". The kings of England were traditionally likened to the sun (Oberon = William. Significantly, William and Mary were married on his birthday, 4 November.). The Chinese scene in the final masque is in homage to Queen Mary's famous collection of china. The garden shown above it and the exotic animals bring King William back into the picture and Hymen's song in praise of their marriage, plus the stage direction bringing (Mary's) china vases containing (William's) orange trees {{to the front of the}} stage complete the symbolism.|$|E

60|$|On these lonely {{hills and}} dales her {{quiescent}} glide {{was of a}} piece with the element she moved in. Her flexuous and stealthy figure became {{an integral part of the}} scene. At times her whimsical fancy would intensify natural processes around her till <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> a part of her own story. Rather they became a part of it; for the world is only a psychological phenomenon, and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>they</b> were. The midnight airs and gusts, moaning amongst the tightly-wrapped buds and bark of the winter twigs, were formulae of bitter reproach. A wet day was the expression of irremediable grief at her weakness in the mind of some vague ethical being whom she could not class definitely as the God of her childhood, and could not comprehend as any other.|$|R

60|$|Crossing the veranda, {{and passing}} {{through an open}} window hung with silk curtains, Hart entered a cool dark room.

The town was a small one, and above it rose the fortress, which stood on a rock rising sheer {{from the bottom of the}} valley, and standing boldly out from the hillside. The communication was effected by a shoulder which, starting from a point halfway up the rock, joined the hill behind it. Along this shoulder were walls and gateways. An enemy attacking these would be exposed to the fire from the summit of the rock. From the point where the shoulder joined the rock, a zigzag road had been cut, with enormous labour, in the face of the rock, to the summit.|$|R
