Therefore, this magnetic anisotropy could be tailored by controlling the deposition time of the <b>normally</b> deposited <b>Co</b> layer. In our samples, the anisotropy field ranged from 12 to 72 kA/m.|$|R

40|$|Cardiac output (CO) is an {{indicator}} for fitness. <b>Normally,</b> <b>CO</b> increases during exercise. Effects of diseases upon exercise performance {{can be measured}} by comparing CO of healthy individuals and the patient. Five CO measurements are reviewed and compared based on their attractiveness to use in children during exercise. Such a technique should be non-invasive, easy to use, reliable, accurate and sensitive. The techniques reviewed are the Fick principle, acetylene rebreathing, Doppler ultrasound method, pulse pressure methods and electrical bioimpedance. In conclusion, Finapres (Nexfin), a non-invasive pulse pressure method, meets almost all criteria and is therefore the most ideal method to determine CO in children during exercise...|$|R

40|$|There {{are two quite}} {{distinct}} ways {{in which}} events that <b>we</b> <b>normally</b> think of as “physical ” relate in an intimate way to events that <b>we</b> <b>normally</b> think of as “psychological”. One intimate relation occurs in exteroception {{at the point where}} events in the world become events as-perceived. The other intimate relationship occurs at the interface of conscious experience with its neural correlates in the brain. The chapter examines each of these relationships and positions them within a dual-aspect, reflexive model of how consciousness relates to the brain and external world. The chapter goes on to provide grounds for viewing mind and nature as fundamentally psychophysical, and examines similar views as well as differences in previously unpublished writings of Wolfgang Pauli, {{one of the founders of}} quantum mechanics...|$|R
