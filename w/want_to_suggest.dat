500|$|Asked at {{the hearing}} by Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{attorney}} Roger Robb whether he was planning [...] "to suggest that Dr. Oppenheimer is disloyal to the United States", Teller replied that:I do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> anything of the kind. I know Oppenheimer as an intellectually most alert and a very complicated person, and I {{think it would be}} presumptuous and wrong on my part if I would try in any way to analyze his motives. But I have always assumed, and I now assume that he is loyal to the United States. I believe this, and I shall believe it until I see very conclusive proof to the opposite.He was immediately asked whether he believed that Oppenheimer was a [...] "security risk", to which he testified: ...|$|E
500|$|However, the {{response}} was not exclusively positive. In The Independent on Sunday, columnist Lucy Ellmann criticised both what she saw as the unchanging nature of the characters and Flannery's concentration on friendship rather than family. [...] "What's in the water there anyway? These are the youngest grandparents ever seen! Nothing has changed about them since 1964 except a few grey hairs... It's quite impressive that anything emotional could be salvaged from this nine-part hop, skip and jump through the years. In fact we still hardly know these people – zooming from one decade to the next has a distancing effect," [...] she wrote of the former point. And of the latter, [...] "Peter Flannery seems to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that friendships are the only cure for a life blighted by deficient parents. But all that links this ill-matched foursome in the end is history and sentimentality. The emotional centre of the writing is still in family ties." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1977, she said, [...] "For years people <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> {{politics}} was a nasty word". Her opinion said, [...] "the schools {{are the most}} significant institution in society, and necessarily education must be politicized".|$|R

6000|$|... "Hubbell has had {{a romantic}} moment. He thinks that {{in view of the}} {{restitution}} Tedham made as far as he could, and his excellent record--elsewhere--it would be a fine thing for the Reciprocity to employ him again in our office, and he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> it <b>to</b> the actuary." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{change of}} name from Mallar to Pallar {{is thought to have}} been imposed upon them after the decline of the rule, when the leaders (Nayaks) of {{competing}} tribes <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> a degradation in status.

6000|$|... "You {{must have}} some tea," [...] said Mr. Brumley, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that they should agree to Sir Isaac's figure of three {{thousand}} eight hundred, but not as pounds but guineas.

5000|$|There's {{a right-wing}} {{football}} and a left-wing football. Right-wing football <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> {{that life is}} struggle. It demands sacrifices.

6000|$|That, they {{explained}} {{in a sort of}} chorus, was the cardinal idea of their lives, what they were up to, what they stood for. [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> to you," [...] they said--and I found this was a stock opening of theirs--"that from the mere necessities of convenience elected bodies MUST avail themselves {{more and more of the}} services of expert officials. We have that very much in mind. The more complicated and technical affairs become, the less confidence will the elected official have in himself. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that these expert officials must necessarily develop into a new class and a very powerful class in the community. We want to organise that. It may be THE power of the future. They will necessarily have to have very much of a common training. We consider ourselves as amateur unpaid precursors of such a class."...|$|E

40|$|Thee {{intent of}} this article is to explore the scope and working of “framework-rules” in {{relation}} to self-organization in urban development, both theoretically and empirically. It explores the strategies promoted in Oosterwold (Almere, e Netherland), and the framework-rules that discipline its emergent development, without <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> that Oosterwold is a “best practice”. It is an extreme case that helps us to broaden our thinking about governing urban development...|$|R

40|$|This fun polemical {{piece was}} written {{several months ago}} on a tip that the Chronicle of Higher Education might be {{interested}} in publishing something like it.

Mrs. Dowey knows she is a criminal, but, unlike the actress, {{she does not know}} that she is about to be found out; and she is, to put it bluntly in her own Scotch way, the merriest of the whole clanjamfry.

60|$|What I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> {{is that no}} {{one understands}} China until this {{document}} has ceased to seem absurd. The Romans claimed to rule the world, and what lay outside their Empire was to them of no account. The Empire of Chien Lung was more extensive, with probably a larger population; it had risen to greatness {{at the same time as}} Rome, and had not fallen, but invariably defeated all its enemies, either by war or by absorption. Its neighbours were comparatively barbarous, except the Japanese, who acquired their civilization by slavish imitation of China. The view of Chien Lung was no more absurd than that of Alexander the Great, sighing for new worlds to conquer when he had never even heard of China, where Confucius had been dead already for a hundred and fifty years. Nor was he mistaken as regards trade: China produces everything needed for the happiness of its inhabitants, and we have forced trade upon them solely for our benefit, giving them in exchange only things which they would do better without.|$|E
