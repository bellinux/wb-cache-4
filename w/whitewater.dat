5|$|In December 2009, it was {{reported}} that <b>WhiteWater</b> World planned to add a <b>WhiteWater</b> West AquaLoop. However Village Roadshow Theme Parks, owner of competitor Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast, attempted to negotiate an exclusivity agreement with the manufacturer. Three months later in February 2010, it was announced that <b>WhiteWater</b> World would build an alternative attraction built by ProSlide before the April school holidays. The Wedgie, the first ProSlide Superloop, opened on 1 April 2011. It was the first ride in Australia to feature a trap door release and was marketed as Australia's first looping water slide.|$|E
5|$|In November 1993, David Hale—the {{source of}} {{criminal}} allegations against Bill Clinton in the <b>Whitewater</b> controversy—alleged {{that while he}} was governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the <b>Whitewater</b> land deal. A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the <b>Whitewater</b> project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, {{staff at}} <b>WhiteWater</b> World stopped Paralympian Steve Simmonds from riding the slides. Simmonds was angry {{and stated that}} {{he felt like he}} was {{discriminated}} against. <b>WhiteWater</b> World cited manufacturer guidelines and safety concerns as the reasons behind the restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Prior to opening, <b>WhiteWater</b> World was criticised {{for being}} built {{during one of}} Australia's worst {{droughts}} and in an area on Level 5 water restrictions. When designing <b>WhiteWater</b> World, Macquarie Leisure implemented measures {{to ensure that the}} park {{was one of the most}} water efficient water parks in the world through the minimisation of water loss.|$|E
5|$|Since September 2007, <b>WhiteWater</b> World {{has hosted}} an {{undercover}} events venue, the largest at an Australian theme park, The Shell. The venue can cater {{for up to}} 2000 guests and {{is located on the}} southeast corner of <b>WhiteWater</b> World.|$|E
5|$|The {{best time}} for <b>whitewater</b> boating on Loyalsock Creek at Worlds End State Park is from March to May, and the park hosts a slalom race on Loyalsock Creek each spring. The <b>whitewater</b> {{gradient}} is 41 for {{the section of the}} creek in and near the park, and its rating on the International Scale of River Difficulty is II to III+, with sections reaching IV. The water is too swift for open canoes, so visitors are asked to use kayaks. The swimming area is closed to <b>whitewater</b> boating during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, <b>WhiteWater</b> World's {{contract}} with Nickelodeon was terminated and Nickelodeon's Pipeline Plunge was renamed Pipeline Plunge.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its lineup of attractions, <b>WhiteWater</b> World also has a retail outlet, an events venue, cabanas, and several food and beverage outlets.|$|E
5|$|Steep and {{strewn with}} rapids, the Kootenay, despite being {{unsuitable}} for commercial transportation of agricultural and mineral products, {{is considered an}} outstanding <b>whitewater</b> river. <b>Whitewater</b> rafting is popular on the Kootenay in two stretches: in Jennings Canyon between the Libby Dam in Montana and Bonners Ferry in Idaho, and in {{the upper reaches of}} the river in Kootenay National Park in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|The Čunovo Water Sports Centre is a <b>whitewater</b> slalom and rafting area, {{close to}} the Gabčíkovo dam. It hosts several {{international}} and national canoe and kayak competitions annually.|$|E
5|$|<b>WhiteWater</b> World is a water park {{situated}} in the suburb of Coomera on the Gold Coast, Australia. It is {{owned and operated by}} Ardent Leisure.|$|E
5|$|<b>WhiteWater</b> World {{performed}} above expectations {{after opening}} with approximately 23,000 guests between 8 December and 31 December 2006. <b>WhiteWater</b> World continued to exceed Macquarie Leisure's expectations {{during its first}} year of operation. The first year saw 493,227 guests, exceeding the 450,000 estimate, earning the park over $8.4million in revenue. The park continued to perform well in subsequent years with an 18.4% increase in attendance in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Also in the 1980s, The Clintons' {{personal}} and business affairs included transactions {{that became the}} basis of the <b>Whitewater</b> controversy investigation, which later dogged his presidential administration. After extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} full year of operation, <b>WhiteWater</b> World {{attracted}} more visitors than the expected 450,000 guests. Attendance records show close to 500,000 guests attended the park during that period.|$|E
5|$|From April 2011, <b>WhiteWater</b> World {{has offered}} guests the hire of 12 luxury cabanas, located around the park. Each cabana is {{designed}} for up to four guests, {{who have access to}} deck chairs, couches, a coffee table, an iPod dock, towels and a mini refrigerator.|$|E
5|$|<b>WhiteWater</b> World opened {{three weeks}} ahead of {{schedule}} on 8 December 2006 {{after a week of}} previews. The park opened with ten attractions, including The Green Room, The Rip, Super Tubes Hydrocoaster, The BRO, The Temple of Huey (3 individual slides), Pipeline Plunge, Wiggle Bay and the Cave of Waves. At this time, the park featured many Australian and world firsts: The Rip and Super Tubes Hydrocoaster were both Australian firsts; The BRO was a world first; and The Green Room was Australia's biggest Tornado slide. After six months of operation Macquarie Leisure announced that <b>WhiteWater</b> World attracted 247,360 visitors, producing a revenue of $8.7million and a profit of $4million.|$|E
5|$|<b>WhiteWater</b> World was {{designed}} to be very efficient in its water use. Since opening, the quantity of visitors has consistently been above expectations. Ardent Leisure has submitted a development application for the expansion of the water park and plans to add five new attractions.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} {{planning}} and a year of construction, <b>WhiteWater</b> World {{opened to the public}} on 8 December 2006. The ten Australian beach culture themed attractions cost approximately A$56million. These included The Green Room, Super Tubes Hydrocoaster, The Rip, The BRO, Temple of Huey, Cave of Waves, Wiggle Bay, and Pipeline Plunge. Since then, four additional water slides: two called Little Rippers, one called The Wedgie and one called the Triple Vortex, have been added.|$|E
5|$|Every year, {{visitors}} in the Muskrat Lake area search for Mussie in the lake; none have yet captured evidence of its existence. In the 1990s, a tourism marketing {{campaign for the}} area offered CAN$1 million to anyone who could capture a live specimen, but no one did. Mussie is referenced in travel pamphlets for the <b>Whitewater</b> Region area; one suggests {{that it can be}} caught by a fishing rod.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs {{has worked}} in the timber industry, as a manager with a <b>whitewater</b> rafting company in Lake Luzerne, New York, and as an outdoor {{adventure}} guide in Gunnison, Colorado. As a local businessperson, {{he was a member of}} and diplomat for the Summit Chamber of Commerce, and was elected to their board for a three-year term in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The Beyond the Beach shop, {{located near}} the park's entrance, sells surf and <b>WhiteWater</b> World branded merchandise. The shop {{contains}} a Kodak photo centre that allows guests to purchase on-ride photos taken on the Super Tubes Hydrocoaster and photographs taken inside the park. Beyond the Beach also serves as the exit gates for the park.|$|E
5|$|The Trinity is {{a popular}} <b>whitewater</b> rafting and kayaking river. Dam {{releases}} for fish restoration have incidentally increased {{the amount of water}} available for boating year-round. The river has three main <b>whitewater</b> runs, all known for their scenery and wildlife. The Pigeon Point section, alongside Highway 299, contains Class II-III (beginner to intermediate) rapids. Below the takeout at Cedar Flat, the Trinity flows through the extremely hazardous Class V Burnt Ranch Gorge, which was first run in 1971 by three kayakers, one of whom {{died of a heart attack}} soon after finishing the run, due to the arduous work of portaging many rapids. This gave the area a bad reputation for many years; it was not until 1983 when commercial trips began on this section of the river. The lower Trinity, much of which flows through the Hoopa Valley Reservation, is a Class II river with gentler and lower gradient despite having a greater volume of water flow.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Whitewater</b> {{controversy}} was {{the focus}} of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the <b>Whitewater</b> Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm and may have been improperly subsidizing <b>Whitewater</b> losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed. She said she had done minimal work for the bank. Independent counsels Robert Fiske and Kenneth Starr subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were. The records were found in the First Lady's White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996. The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been. Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury. After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|Towns {{in areas}} {{formerly}} covered by Lake Cahuilla include, {{from north to}} south, Indio, Thermal, Mecca, Mortmar, Niland, Calipatria, Brawley, Imperial and El Centro. Calexico and Mexicali may have been covered as well. To the southeast, the New River and the Alamo River now flow through the dry lakebed, while the <b>Whitewater</b> River and the San Felipe Creek enter from the northwest and southwest, respectively.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{discovery}} of the Watkins memo, and based upon a suggestion from the Office of Independent Counsel, on March 20, 1996, Attorney General Janet Reno requested that <b>Whitewater</b> Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr expand his inquiry to specifically include the travel office affair, in particular allegations that White House employees had lied about Hillary Clinton's role in the firings, and that David Watkins or Hillary Clinton had made false statements in previous testimony to the GAO, Congress, or the Independent Counsel.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} <b>Whitewater</b> River and local washes were {{considered}} {{the primary source}} of these sands, which would have been transported to the Algodones area by longshore drift. This would imply a minimum age of 160,000 years. Later the Colorado River was identified as the main source of these sediments, potentially with some contribution from local drainages. At prevailing winds, most of the sediments from the Colorado would have been transported to the Cerro Prieto area and possibly carried by wind to the Gran Desierto de Altar.|$|E
5|$|Fishing, four-wheel driving, swimming, boating, camping, sightseeing, and picnicking are {{the primary}} {{recreational}} activities in the watershed. <b>Whitewater</b> kayaking is also popular in the winter months when water levels are high. Several trails are maintained throughout the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, {{as well as other}} regions in the watershed. Eight boat launches are located on the river between its confluence with the south fork and its mouth. Alfred A. Loeb State Park, located {{on the banks of the}} Chetco, has three cabins and 48 camping sites.|$|E
5|$|He {{was married}} to Catherine Coffee from 1830 until her death after childbirth. On October 8, 1832, Palmer became a United States citizen. Palmer married his second wife, Sarah Ann Derbyshire, in 1836, and bought land near Laurel, Indiana, in the <b>Whitewater</b> Valley, where he {{supervised}} a construction project for a canal. In 1843, he was elected as a Democrat to the Indiana House of Representatives for a one-year term. Representing Franklin County, he was re-elected to the legislature in 1844.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Rodham {{became the}} first woman to be made a full partner of Rose Law Firm. From 1978 until they entered the White House, she had a higher salary than her husband. During 1978 and 1979, while looking to {{supplement}} their income, Rodham engaged in the trading of cattle futures contracts; an initial $1,000 investment generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months. At this time, the couple also began their ill-fated investment in the <b>Whitewater</b> Development Corporation real estate venture with Jim and Susan McDougal. Both of these became subjects of controversy in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In some {{countries}} {{a highlight of}} the year for Scouts is spending at least a week in the summer engaging in an outdoor activity. This can be a camping, hiking, sailing, or other trip with the unit, or a summer camp with broader participation (at the council, state, or provincial level). Scouts attending a summer camp work on Scout badges, advancement, and perfecting Scoutcraft skills. Summer camps can operate specialty programs for older Scouts, such as sailing, backpacking, canoeing and <b>whitewater,</b> caving, and fishing.|$|E
5|$|Other major streams that drained into Lake Cahuilla were <b>Whitewater</b> River {{from the}} north, and San Felipe Creek and Carrizo Creek from the southwest. More minor {{drainage}} came from Arroyo Salado {{on the western}} shore, and Salt Creek and Mammoth Wash on the eastern shore. Additional unnamed drainages did exist. Drainage from the Chocolate Mountains and the Cargo Muchacho Mountains may have reached the lake but are now buried by the Algodones Dunes. All these water systems are ephemeral.|$|E
5|$|Rivers in Boise National Forest {{offer the}} {{opportunity}} for rafting and kayaking through rapids up to class four, with the most difficult sections on the South Fork and main stems of the Payette River. Numerous developed boat launch sites provide access to rivers for <b>whitewater</b> enthusiasts, and Dagger Falls is the primary launching site for visitors to the Middle Fork of the Salmon River and Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. Motorized boating is permitted on Anderson Ranch Reservoir, Deadwood Reservoir, and Warm Lake.|$|E
5|$|The Togolese {{team for}} the 2004 Athens Games {{featured}} canoeist Boukpeti competing in the men's K-1. This was his debut at an Olympic Games, although he would later return for both the 2008 and 2012 Games. Boukpeti had competed for France as a junior, but switched allegiance in adulthood to Togo since his father was born there. Boukpeti had only ever visited the country once, as a child. Boukpeti had changed his national allegiance {{in order to make}} Olympic qualification easier. He was the only competitor for an African national at the 2004 Games in the events held at the Deodoro Olympic <b>Whitewater</b> Stadium.|$|E
5|$|The sixteen contestants were {{initially}} separated into two tribes, named Tagi and Pagong, which represented {{the names of}} their beaches. When ten players remained, the contestants merged into one tribe, named Rattana. While Tagi and Pagong's names and makeups were picked by the producers, Rattana was named by contestants Sean Kenniff and Jenna Lewis, because of a large amount of Rattan wood on the island. After 39 days of competition, corporate trainer Richard Hatch was named the Sole Survivor, defeating <b>whitewater</b> rafting guide Kelly Wiglesworth in a 4–3 jury vote.|$|E
5|$|The {{state has}} always been a {{destination}} for mountaineering, hiking, and rock climbing in India. A recent development in adventure tourism in the region has been <b>whitewater</b> rafting in Rishikesh. Due to its proximity to the Himalaya ranges, the place is full of hills and mountains and is suitable for trekking, climbing, skiing, camping, rock climbing, and paragliding. Roopkund is a trekking site, known for the mysterious skeletons found in a lake, which was featured by National Geographic Channel in a documentary. The trek to Roopkund passes through the meadows of Bugyal.|$|E
5|$|Today, the Trinity River is an {{important}} water source for irrigation and hydroelectricity generation, {{as well as a}} major center of recreational activities such as gold panning, fishing and <b>whitewater</b> rafting. Since 1964 the Trinity River has been dammed to create Trinity Lake, the third largest man-made lake in the state. As much as 90percent of the upper Trinity River watershed was diverted for agriculture in the Central Valley. In 1991 environmental regulations were enacted, requiring a greater release of water to the Trinity River in order to protect fish. However, the use of Trinity River water remains a contentious issue, especially in years of drought.|$|E
