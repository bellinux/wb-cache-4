[...] "Special Treatment" [...] was composed in response to claims by a West Australian pastoralist that Aborigines receive better treatment than other Australians. [...] "'Special Treatment' is another one like that, a specific situation and write to it..." [...] Kelly's song wryly spells out <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> special treatment has actually meant.|$|E

5000|$|A Thing Called Divine Fits was {{generally}} well received by critics, with aggregate rating site Metacritic assigning it {{a score of}} 77 out of 100 based on 30 reviews.

40|$|Can {{there be}} {{grounding}} without necessitation?

It is an orthodoxy in recent literature about the nature of grounding, and in first-order philosophical disputes about what grounds <b>what,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> answer is no. I will argue that the correct answer is yes. I present two novel arguments against grounding necessitarianism, and show that grounding contingentism is fully compatible with the various explanatory roles that grounding is widely thought to pla...|$|E

40|$|This item {{is closed}} access because the {{publisher}} {{does not allow}} book chapters to be made open access. The present chapter takes an interest in instructions {{and the ways in}} which sequential analysis under the auspices of ethnomethodology and conversation analysis can contribute to their explication. This interest is explored in four contexts: textual instructions on how to crochet, instructions in textile workshops, feedback in academic supervision, and seminars in dental education. Initially, some general features of instructions are discussed in relation to the textual instructions – the irremediable incompleteness of instructions, how the sense of instructions is found in attempts to follow them, and the ties between instructions and assessment. The remaining three cases are used to highlight some differences with regards to the organization of instructions – how instructions are formulated, how instructions are responded to, the access teachers have to student understanding, what the relevant materializations of competence are, and the temporal organization in which these instructions are embedded. The temporal-material organization of a given setting is something with which both participants and analysts have to contend. How teachers and students do that – how they for instance orient to and manage the essential absence of relevant displays of understanding as a condition of their work – is <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sequential analysis of instruction sets out to explicate...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} leadership styles that have been adopted {{over the years in}} the nursing profession. Effective leadership within nursing is vital as strong nursing leaders are crucial {{if there is to be}} an effective contribution from nurses. The literature identified that leadership is influential in creating the workplace culture, it was also claimed that the workplace culture has an influence on both staff nurses and patients well-being. There is limited literature exploring the staff nurses’ perceptions of their nurse managers’ leadership and workplace stress. Of the literature that was identified it was suggested that one of the ways to help reduce or manage staff stress levels is effective leadership, yet did not state <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> most effective way to manage it was. The purpose of this research proposal is to explore staff nurses perceptions of clinical leadership and its influences on their perceived workplace stress. An exploratory descriptive design has been adopted to explore nurses’ thoughts, feelings and opinions to gain in-depth accounts of their experiences. The use of a focus group followed up by one-to-one interviews has been utilised, the focus group allows the topic to be discuss and highlight any talking points that can be probed further during the interview. The study will take place within an acute teaching hospital, the author will form the research team. A purposive sampling strategy will be utilised to invite the staff nurses working within general medical wards to participate in the study. A sample of 10 - 15 nurses will take part in a focus group followed be individual semi-structured interviews to explore their perceptions of clinical leadership and its influence on their workplace stress. It is hoped that allowing the reflection upon the experiences it will enhance the researchers’ knowledge and understanding. The findings from this study may be adopted to inform further research within this topic area. It is hoped that the findings will help improve future nursing practice, as it will provide insight into what aspects of clinical leadership are the most effective in managing stress in the workplace...|$|E
40|$|The Reader 2 ̆ 7 s Encyclopedia of the American West, {{edited by}} Yale {{historian}} Howard Lamar {{and published by}} Thomas Y. Crowell Company in 1977, {{was a pretty good}} book, bringing to the American public the first comprehensive single-volume treatment {{of the history of the}} West. But that reference work has now been superseded-and dwarfed-by this new rendition, also edited by Lamar. More than 1250 pages of three-column text, 1. 5 million words in all, are given over to 2400 alphabetically ordered entries written by more than three hundred scholars. Long thematic entries, on the fur trade or railroads, for example, are interspersed with shorter pieces, often on individuals. Six hundred photographs and a good number of maps augment a readable text. A bibliography at the end of most entries points the reader to additional sources; there is some cross-referencing of entries, though not enough; and there is an index, but only of the names of persons (there was no index at all in the 1977 edition). All in all, this is a handsome, informative, engaging book-well worth the asking price. It rightfully takes its place alongside the rival four-volume Encyclopedia of the American West, edited by Charles Phillips and Alan Axelrod (1996), as the best reference works on the West. The New Encyclopedia, like its predecessor, is ambitious in both conception and scope: in conception, because it includes the West as process, a frontier stage occurring across the entire United States, as well as the West as a place, the western half of the country; in scope, because among its entries are old favorites of western history, such as wars, politics, and gunfighters, but also more recent concerns, such as gender, ethnicity, and environment. So, for example, there is an entry on Plymouth Rock and another on the early settlement of Vermont, but only states of the West get the full treatment with coverage of their histories from early settlement through to the present. This is a logical way of dealing with the ambiguous meaning of the West, but the complexity of the arrangement, mixing temporal and spatial parameters, causes some confusion, as is evident in the entries on Physiography and Vegetation, two of the longest essays in the book. Whereas the former deals with the physiography of the entire country, the latter covers only the vegetation of the Western United States, suggesting <b>what?</b> <b>That</b> <b>the</b> shape of the land was more important to settlers than the availability of wood? The selection of entries and their content tell a good deal about the way scholarship on the West has developed since the 1977 version. Interpretive essays on African Americans (Negroes in the first edition), Mexican Americans, and Asian Americans have been expanded, new entries (Prostitution on the Frontier, for instance) have been added, and many more have been revised. To the editor 2 ̆ 7 s credit, however, Frederick Jackson Turner and his Frontier Thesis are not shunned or castigated, as is the fashion in some of the New Western History. (It is hard to understand why Turner has been so lambasted for being a product of his times, when, after all, the New Western Historians, also products of their times, will surely be eventually disregarded too.) A concern with the historiography of the West, as well as its actual lived history, is apparent throughout The New Encyclopedia in the large number of entries on historians, including Walter Prescott Webb, Dale L. Morgan, Angie Debo, and, deservedly, Lamar himself...|$|E
