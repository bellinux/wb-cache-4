5|$|Although Gibraltar's {{civilian}} inhabitants {{had started}} to return as early as April 1944, the last evacuees did not arrive back home until as late as February 1951. The immediate problem after VJ Day <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of shipping, as all available vessels were needed to bring troops home, but the longer-term problem <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of civilian housing. The garrison was relocated to {{the southern end of}} the peninsula to free up space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had either been built or were under construction.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of Curse of Enchantia was mostly positive, especially {{in regard to}} its graphics and animation. However, the game was derided by some for its confusing user interface system, often illogical puzzle solutions and what some reviewers thought <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of quality humor, plot development and atmosphere, attributing it {{to the absence of}} text and dialogue.|$|E
5|$|For the U.S. program {{there were}} {{teething}} troubles. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of sufficient numbers of sensor strings and controlling {{the number of}} aircraft available for the missions proved problematic. These difficulties could be remedied. Commando Hunt II (1 May through 31 October 1969), however, was thrown off track by phenomena that the Air Force could do absolutely nothing about. The first wet season offensive was hampered by atrocious weather, especially heavy rain (48inches of rain in July alone).|$|E
25|$|Honduras {{in general}} {{has not had}} any stable medical care, the reasons being there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of {{political}} stability and 62.8% {{of the country is}} in poverty and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of medical caretakers, or proper training for the caretakers, in the country.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} {{children}} were killed, injured or orphaned by the violence. Organisations such as Citizens' Initiative reported that the violence resulted in the disturbance of children's studies and that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of counselling. Students at Gujarat University were unable to take examinations, which were cancelled due to the chances of disruption. While other schools in the state had to postpone or cancel exams, {{it was reported that}} some schools held examinations under police protection. It was also reported that many students were forced to leave their studies due to lack of funds or to earn a livelihood because they had lost income-earning members of their families.|$|E
5|$|All trucks of the LRDG were {{equipped}} with the Bagnold sun compass and some trucks were also {{equipped with}} a P8 Tank Compass. Each patrol had a navigator who always rode in the second truck in the formation. He was equipped with a theodolite and astronomical position tables with which to plot star sightings, and maps. Watches were used and adjusted each evening using the GMT time check. One major problem faced early on by the LRDG <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of accurate maps for Libya in particular. Patrols had {{to do their own}} surveys and make their own maps of each route they took. In July 1941 the Survey Section was formed to carry out this task.|$|E
5|$|As the {{campaign}} unfolded, Krueger was pressured by MacArthur to capture Manila. He sent messages reporting {{what he saw}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of drive among the troops, and even moved his theater headquarters forward of Krueger's. MacArthur tried to exploit Krueger's rivalry with Eichelberger by allowing the latter's Eighth Army to conduct its own drive on Manila from the south. Krueger eventually sent a flying column from the 1st Cavalry Division, but MacArthur's expectation that the Japanese would not defend Manila was proven incorrect. Weeks of ferocious fighting were required to capture the city.|$|E
50|$|The neoclassical view is {{that there}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of incentive, not <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of {{information}} in a planned economy. They argue that within a socialist planned economy there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of incentive to act on information. Therefore, the crucial missing element {{is not so much}} information as the Austrian school argued, as it is the motivation to act on information.|$|R

5|$|Doubt {{was cast}} on this by Robert Dickson in 1878, when {{he pointed out}} that, while {{relatively}} high-status goods were found {{in some of the}} graves disinterred during early building work in Carnoustie, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of weapons. He also talked of the apparent presence of female skeletons. Subsequent finds pointed to the area being a domestic Pictish Long-Cist cemetery, including the remains of a female aged between 40 and 50 with osteoarthritis, who apparently died of tuberculosis. In contrast with Holinshed's account, the burials there are Christian, found in a supine, east-west orientation.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{centralized}} logistical system, the Polish armies were encumbered {{by large}} baggage trains. To some degree, this was turned into an advantage {{with the development of}} the tabor– military horse-drawn wagons, usually carrying army supplies. The wagon use for defensive formations was perfected by the Cossacks, and to a smaller extent used by other Commonwealth units. The Commonwealth army relied on cavalry, which the nobility saw as a much more respectable type of a troop than the infantry. Despite the reforms of the 17th century, it lost much of its military significance in the 18th century; the primary reason for this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of sufficient funding.|$|E
5|$|During {{construction}} of the Voss Line from Bergen to Voss, there was a proposal to extend the line from Voss to Granvin on the Hardangerfjord. The plans were again taken up to consideration with the {{construction of}} the Bergen Line, but also this time the plans were scrapped. Some people wanted the line to be a tramway and when it was passed by the Parliament of Norway on 12 July 1919; the plans incorporated some elements of a tramway, giving the line a lower standard than the mainline. The railway was to be built electrified, and construction started in 1921. However, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of engineers, forcing a slow pace. On 5 November 1923, parliament passed the final plans for the railway, and the pace of construction was accelerated.|$|E

5|$|In 1766, John Gwynn {{complained in}} his work London and Westminster Improved that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of {{planning}} throughout the West End {{and that it would}} be useful to construct a thoroughfare linking Marylebone Park (now Regent's Park) with the Prince Regent's Carlton House. John Fordyce was appointed as Surveyor-General to the First Commissioner of Woods and Forests in 1793 and concluded that there should be a suitable road in place by 1811, when the lease for Marylebone Park ran out and ownership reverted to the Crown. It was hoped the road could link Pall Mall and the Haymarket, of which has since declined in quality. A further problem was increased congestion around Charing Cross, which would benefit from road improvements.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 the IOC began {{enacting}} {{drug testing}} protocols. They started by randomly testing athletes at the 1968 Winter Olympics. The first Winter Games athlete to test positive for a banned substance was Alois Schloder, a West German hockey player, but {{his team was}} still allowed to compete. During the 1970s testing outside of competition was escalated because it was found to deter athletes from using performance-enhancing drugs. The problem with testing during this time <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of standardisation of the test procedures, which undermined {{the credibility of the}} tests. It was not until the late 1980s that international sporting federations began to coordinate efforts to standardise the drug-testing protocols. The IOC took the lead in the fight against steroids when it established the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in November 1999.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 a {{group of}} liberal deputies of the Moscow City Council {{proposed}} Bukovsky's candidacy for elections of the new Mayor of Moscow, following {{the resignation of the}} previous Mayor, Gavriil Popov. Bukovsky refused the offer, stating that to fulfil the mayor’s duties he would need a large team of intellectuals committed to radical reform, and there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of such people in the country. Deputy mayor Yury Luzhkov took over, and ran the city from 1992 to 2010.|$|E

5|$|Josephine {{continued}} to intensify throughout the afternoon {{as the storm}} became more symmetrical. However, due {{to the location of}} the storm, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of accurate wind speed readings, and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity. Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm, the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification. The storm was also heading into an area where shear was forecasted to significantly increase due to an upper-level trough diving southward. Despite convection being partially removed from the center of Josephine, the storm intensified slightly {{in the early morning hours}} on September3 as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized. The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening, causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger.|$|E
5|$|NASCAR {{spokesperson}} Jim Hunter however insisted Smith was {{not forced}} below the yellow line, and stated drivers were warned beforehand in the pre-race drivers' meeting about gaining a position illegally. Earnhardt felt Smith deserved {{to win the}} race, saying there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of clarity over what going below the yellow line meant. Smith stated he {{did not ask for}} clarification of the rule because of his low-profile status. NASCAR president Mike Helton stated that race officials had correctly awarded the penalty to Smith, and clarified that no driver would be allowed to advance their position by going below the yellow line at any time during a race. Similarities were also made between Smith's overtake, and Earnhardt's pass of Kenseth below the yellow line at Talladega at the 2003 Aaron's 499.|$|E
5|$|Strong wind gusts downed nearly 1,500power {{lines and}} knocked over 28 large high tension wire towers at {{a power plant}} in Mariel. As a result, {{more than half of}} the {{electricity}} customers in Havana Province were left without power for 12days after the storm, and all of Pinar del Río Province was without power for over 11days. Blackouts continued in areas where power returned. The power outages resulted in lack of drinking water for numerous people, including no potable water in the city of Havana for four days. As a result, the Cuban government sent water tanks to satisfy the short term need. Similarly, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of gas for cooking for over a week. However, one Cuban government official stated that it could take up to two months for basic utilities to be returned to many isolated villages.|$|E

5|$|The Lakers {{would lose}} 43 games in 1992–93 under Randy Pfund, their first losing season since 1976. The Lakers would still make the playoffs, but were bounced {{in the first}} round. During the 1993–94 season, Pfund was fired during the season {{that would result in}} the Lakers failing to make the playoffs {{for the first time since}} 1976. Magic Johnson, would coach the final 16 games of the season with former {{teammate}} Michael Cooper as his lead assistant. Johnson decided not to take the job permanently due to what he felt <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of commitment from certain players, and Los Angeles ended the season with a 10-game losing streak to finish 33–49.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of agnatic kinship and feudal obligations {{has been seen}} as creating the system of clans in the Highlands in this era. Scottish society adopted theories of the three estates to describe its society and English terminology to differentiate ranks. Serfdom disappeared from the records in the fourteenth century and new social groups of labourers, craftsmen and merchants, became important in the developing burghs. This led to increasing social tensions in urban society, but, in contrast to England and France, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of major unrest in Scottish rural society, where there was relatively little economic change.|$|E
5|$|The {{real problem}} for U.S. {{planners}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lack</b> of sufficient intelligence on the numbers of infiltrators, the amount of supplies being transported, the number of trucks operating, the specific locations of targets in a rapidly changing environment, and the infrastructure of the system. This lack of real intelligence forced the Air Force to basically take its best guess as to PAVN numbers, intentions, and limitations. For instance, Air Force intelligence claimed that 9,012 enemy trucks were destroyed during 1969. Yet, an even lesser estimate of trucks destroyed by the Defense Intelligence Agency only resulted in their computer model reaching zero (where the enemy {{was supposed to be}} out of trucks) no fewer that 14 times during the same time period.|$|E
