5|$|Cyclone Akash (JTWC designation: 01B, {{also known}} as Cyclonic Storm Akash) was the first named {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. <b>Warned</b> <b>by</b> both India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), it formed from an area of disturbed weather on the Bay of Bengal on May 12, and gradually organized as it drifted northward. An eye began to develop as it approached land, and after reaching peak 3-min sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph) it struck about 115km (70mi) south of Chittagong in Bangladesh. Akash rapidly weakened over land, and advisories were discontinued on May 15.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra was <b>warned</b> <b>by</b> fellow {{members of}} the Junta, {{military}} leaders and even the Cabildo that if he left Buenos Aires, the government would be prone to fall into a political crisis. He left anyway, convinced {{that he would be}} able to reorganize the Army of the North. The warnings were justified; shortly after his departure, the Junta was turned into a legislative power, while the executive would be managed by the First Triumvirate. This arrangement lasted for a short time, then the Junta was abolished. The Regiment of Patricians made a mutiny against the triumvirate, but failed.|$|E

Scully and Hendershot visit an army research hospital to have Hendershot's labor induced. Whilst Hendershot is being prepped for the operation, Scully asks to have an ultrasound performed on herself.

5|$|The Afghan Emir was <b>warned</b> <b>by</b> New Delhi of the {{approach}} of the expedition even while efforts were underway to intercept it in the Persian desert. After it crossed into Afghanistan, the Emir was asked to arrest the members. However, Habibullah humoured the British without obeying the Viceroy's requests. He told the Viceroy that he intended to remain neutral and could not take any actions that were overtly pro-British. Indian intelligence became aware—after the expedition had already been Kabul for some time—that they carried with them highly inflammatory letters from the Kaiser and the Turkish Sultan. Through British channels, the Russians voiced their concerns about the Emir's tolerance of the German presence and their intrigues with Pro-German Afghan counsellors.|$|E
5|$|The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, {{set up by}} {{the king}} to report on the events of February and March, did not see any {{evidence}} to support the government's claim that protesters were armed or that medics had supplied them with weapons, however it stated that medics took control of the first floor of Salmaniya hospital.

5|$|The Wolds area {{takes the}} form of an elevated, gently rolling plateau, cut by {{numerous}} deep, steep-sided, flat-bottomed valleys of glacial origin. The chalk formation of the hills provides exceptionally good drainage, with the result that most of these valleys are dry. Surface water is quite scarce throughout the Wolds. At Flamborough Head the Wolds rise up to form high chalk cliffs, where there are water-worn caves and stacks along the shore. Flamborough Headland is designated a Heritage Coast. Coastal erosion around Flamborough Head has led to visitors being <b>warned</b> <b>by</b> the Humber Coastguard to be very careful on coastal paths.|$|E

5|$|The only UEFA European Fixture to {{take place}} at Prenton Park was a UEFA Cup first {{qualifying}} round tie between Irish team Shelbourne and Scottish team Rangers, on 22 July 1998. Due to fears of sectarian violence, and after discussions between the two clubs and UEFA, Prenton Park {{was chosen as the}} venue for the first leg, with Shelbourne as the home team. The match finished 3–5 in favour of Rangers after Shelbourne (at the time a semi-professional side) had earlier taken a 3–0 lead. As a result of this game, Rangers were fined 25,000 Swiss Francs and <b>warned</b> <b>by</b> UEFA for their fans' behaviour at the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{village of}} St. Louis was {{primarily}} a trading hub on the Mississippi River that was governed by Lieutenant Governor Fernando de Leyba, a captain in the Spanish Army, {{but it was also}} the administrative capital of Upper Spanish Louisiana. Leyba was <b>warned</b> <b>by</b> a fur trader in late March 1780 that the British were planning an attack on St. Louis and the nearby American post at Cahokia. He began developing plans for the village's defense. He had an inexperienced militia force of 168 dispersed around the surrounding countryside and only 29 regular army soldiers of the Fijo de Luisiana Colonial Regiment.|$|E
5|$|A {{short time}} later, Luke escapes again by using string to shake a bush and {{distract}} the guards, visiting a nearby {{house where he}} uses an axe to remove his shackles. To keep the guard dogs from following his scent, he spreads curry powder and chili powder across the ground to send them into sneezing fits and overload their sensitive sense of smell. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph of him with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. Luke is <b>warned</b> <b>by</b> the Captain that if he ever attempts to escape again, he will be killed on the spot. Luke is now annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and reveals {{it to be a}} fake. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but after a long stay in the box, when Luke is forced to eat a huge serving of rice, they come to help him finish it.|$|E

5|$|Barely a {{month later}} on 18 August 1851, Juan Manuel de Rosas, {{dictator}} of the Argentine Confederation, declared war on Brazil, beginning the Platine War. Marques de Sousa had been <b>warned</b> <b>by</b> Caxias as early as 27 July 1844 {{of the possibility of}} an armed conflict between Brazil and its Platine neighbor. The government in Rio de Janeiro had prepared against the threat and formed an anti-Rosas alliance consisting of Brazil, Uruguay and dissident Argentine provinces. Caxias, who had been appointed commander-in-chief of Brazilian land forces, placed Marques de Sousa {{at the head of the}} 2nd Brigade, part of the 2nd Division. The Brazilian army crossed into Uruguay in September 1851. On 17 November, while the army was camped in the village of Santa Lucía near the Uruguayan capital, Marques de Sousa was promoted to a higher command, the 1st division. The choice was controversial, as there were two more senior and experienced officers next in line who were bypassed owing to their foreign birth.|$|E
5|$|By July15, Typhoon Ma-on had a {{well-defined}} eye with the strongest convection in its southern periphery. It continued intensifying, and the JTWC estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 220km/h (135mph). Late on July15, Ma-on weakened slightly due to stronger wind shear, which caused its eyewall to break {{apart in the}} northwest quadrant. It re-intensified the next day after an eyewall replacement cycle commenced. At 0600UTC on July16, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph) while the typhoon was located about 1185km (735mi) southeast of Okinawa. Around that time, Ma-on began a motion to the northwest due to a weakening of the subtropical ridge, and it briefly entered the area <b>warned</b> <b>by</b> the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA); the agency gave it the local name Ineng.|$|E
5|$|By mid-morning, it was {{apparent}} that the failure of the New Zealanders to advance their section of the front exposed the left flank of the neighbouring 3rd Australian Division, which had secured its first objective and was pushing on to its second. Likewise, on the New Zealand Division's left, the 9th (Scottish) Division had managed to reach its final objective. Godley issued new instructions to the New Zealand Division; abandoning any hope of getting to the Green Line, it was to push on to the Blue Line in an attack timed for 3:00pm. However, by the early afternoon the flanking Scots had been pushed back while the Australians had failed to make further gains and were withdrawing due to enfilade gunfire on the flanks. Braithwaite, <b>warned</b> <b>by</b> his battalion commanders that capturing the Blue Line was impossible, twice pushed Russell for a cancellation of the attack. Russell's initial response was to instruct the Rifle Brigade to continue, but shortly before the attack was to begin, it was abandoned.|$|E
