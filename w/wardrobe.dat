5|$|Edward {{had managed}} this last {{category}} of personal treasure through an organisation called the Privy <b>Wardrobe.</b> The Keeper of the Privy <b>Wardrobe</b> {{was responsible for}} guarding and recording the king's belongings, and dispatching particular items around the kingdom, potentially giving them as gifts to the monarch's family and friends. The Privy <b>Wardrobe</b> was initially based in the Tower of London in Edward's reign and became focused on handling the supplies for his campaigns in France. This probably encouraged the King to decide {{to build a new}} tower in Westminster to host a separate branch of the Privy <b>Wardrobe</b> specifically to manage his personal jewels and plate. In practice, this branch also managed the clothes, vestments and similar goods belonging to the royal household– effectively, the non-military parts of the King's property.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} notorious {{examples}} of <b>wardrobing</b> comes from the film My Date With Drew, which was filmed entirely on a <b>wardrobed</b> video camera. The filmmaker purchased the camera from Circuit City, used it for 30 days to film his movie, and then returned the camera for a full refund.|$|R
5|$|Green {{also took}} photos of a {{prepared}} list of 140 locations for later reconstruction in the studio. These included many real estate offices and homes {{such as those}} belonging to Marion and her sister. He also found a girl who looked just like he imagined Marion and photographed her whole <b>wardrobe,</b> which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the <b>wardrobe</b> supervisor. The look of the Bates house was modeled on Edward Hopper's painting The House by the Railroad, a fanciful portrait of the Second Empire Victorian home at 18 Conger Avenue in Haverstraw, New York.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor, suspecting {{that the}} <b>wardrobe</b> {{contains}} the evil George fears, opens {{it to find}} its contents are simply clothes and toys, including a doll house. The Doctor suddenly recalls from Alex's photo album that Claire did not appear pregnant in {{the weeks leading up}} to George's supposed birth, causing Alex to remember the fact that Claire was unable to have children. The Doctor asserts that George is a Tenza child, an empathic alien who took on the form of Alex and Claire's desired child through a perception filter, and has the ability to literally lock away his fears in the <b>wardrobe.</b> George begins to panic from this revelation and the Doctor and Alex are pulled into the <b>wardrobe,</b> joining Rory in the dollhouse. As the dolls descend on the three, the Doctor calls out to George to face his fears; George is able to open the <b>wardrobe</b> and appears in the dollhouse, but the dolls turn to advance on him. The Doctor realises that George is still frightened that Alex and Claire plan to send him away, having mistakenly interpreted a conversation they had earlier that night; Alex rushes through the dolls to embrace George as his son. They all soon find themselves back at the estate, restored to normal. Claire returns the next morning to find George no longer scared while Alex and the Doctor make him breakfast. After being thanked, the Doctor rejoins his companions to set off for their next adventure.|$|E

5|$|Azalea also envisioned an Eastern {{theme for}} the music video because of the song's Eastern music {{influences}} and her interest in Bollywood films. BRTHR wrote a Hindu wedding scenario for the video, with Azalea as the bride. At Azalea's request, the video was filmed in Mumbai's streets and slums, and on Bollywood sets. Because of the increased cost of filming on location, Azalea decided to personally contribute to the video's budget. T.I. was scheduled {{to appear in the}} music video, but was unable due to visa delays. Azalea's stylist, Alejandra Hernandez, coordinated the rapper's <b>wardrobe,</b> inspired by Bollywood disco era and Indian actress Parveen Babi. Hernandez used bold-coloured saris in the video; she prepared Azalea's <b>wardrobe</b> in Los Angeles, and her creations were made in London and Mumbai. Azalea's jewelry was also purchased in Mumbai.|$|E

5|$|Edington's {{parents were}} Roger and Amice of Edington near Westbury, Wiltshire. Though {{it has been}} claimed that he was educated at Oxford, {{there seems to be}} no support for this. His first patron, however, was the Oxford {{chancellor}} Gilbert Middleton, who was also a royal counsellor. When Middleton died in 1331, Edington entered the service of Middleton's friend, Adam Orleton, Bishop of Winchester. Through Orleton, Edington's abilities were brought to the attention of King Edward III, and in 1341 the King named him keeper of the <b>wardrobe.</b> The position was an important one; the <b>wardrobe</b> functioned as the treasury while the King was on campaign, and Edward strongly resisted any attempts to limit this royal prerogative.|$|E

Katie, too, {{witnesses}} the pair kissing, but is interrupted when her footballer boyfriend, Danny Guillermo (Henry Garrett), and dozens of his friends arrive at the house to crash the party. Hiding {{from the rest of}} the party, Effy finds Cook, and they have sex in the <b>wardrobe.</b> They fall through the wall into the next room and find a DVD which shows Angela having sex with her older neighbour, Martin (James Fleet). Freddie comes to take JJ home and confronts Effy about leaving Pandora for Cook. As he leaves, so does Effy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wardrobing</b> {{is a form}} {{of return}} fraud. It is the {{practice}} of purchasing an item, using it, and then returning it to the store for a refund. It is most often done with expensive clothing - hence the name - but the practice is also common with tools, electronics, and even computers. To prevent this practice, some stores make certain items, such as wedding dresses or Christmas decorations unreturnable. Some observers classify <b>wardrobing</b> as a form of shoplifting.|$|R
50|$|On the {{afternoon}} of February 12, 1887, following a matinée performance of Lady Audley's Secret at the Masonic Opera House in Augusta, Georgia, a fire broke out that destroyed the theater and nearby Globe and Central hotels. Bowers’ company managed to escape with just the clothes on their backs, leaving behind <b>wardrobes</b> valued upwards of $20,000. Gallatin's <b>wardrobes</b> alone were valued at around $800. As {{a result of the}} Augusta fire, Bowers cancelled their remaining Southern tour dates and returned to New York.|$|R
50|$|The Domesday book {{talks of}} {{the large number of}} pigs at (Princes) Risborough. Pigs were often found in clearings {{at the edges of the}} woods, the animals allowed to wander through {{sectioned}} areas of the woods. The row of piggeries in the lea of the woods became the start of a settlement called Loosley Row. Loosley Row stretched from Brimmer's Farm, east of Princes Risborough, round the side of the hill to the hamlet we know today. It included <b>Wardrobes</b> farm and <b>Wardrobes</b> House.|$|R
5|$|The {{distinction}} between the king's personal household department of the <b>Wardrobe</b> and the governmental department of the Chancery, which was headed by the chancellor, disappeared almost entirely during Burnell's period of office. The <b>Wardrobe</b> had developed as a less formal department for the collection and distribution of money, but under Edward had effectively become a treasury for warfare. There was no rivalry between the holders of the Great Seal, the official seal of government and used for formal documents, and the Privy Seal, used to authenticate the king's less formal letters. During Burnell's time in office the king only used a Privy Seal warrant, or an informal set of instructions for the chancellor to issue {{a letter from the}} Chancery under the Great Seal, when the king and Burnell were apart; after Burnell's death the number of Privy Seal warrants increased greatly.|$|E
