25|$|Nova Beck {{is one of}} two streams {{that run}} through Oakwell, both running north to south. Nova Beck forms the western {{boundary}} of Nova Wood and flows through areas of wildflowers. Many of the species present such as yellow archangel, wood anemone and <b>wild</b> <b>garlic</b> are good indicators of ancient woodland. Hard shield fern, red campion and herb bennet grow in abundance.|$|E
25|$|Oakwell Beck winds {{its course}} along the {{southern}} boundary of Colliery Field. Along its length are exposed coal seams and fossilized 'ripples' from ancient seas. It {{does not support the}} same diversity of plants as Nova Beck, but in spring and early summer, the wooded areas are thick with <b>wild</b> <b>garlic,</b> lesser celandine and bistort. Occasional patches of lords and ladies survive in shadier parts. ash, alder and willow make up the majority of the tree cover and provide habitat for tawny owls.|$|E

The porchetta is today a popular dish in Venetian cuisine.|$|R
500|$|Castell Coch {{remained}} derelict; the antiquarian John Leland, visiting around 1536, {{described it}} as [...] "all in ruin, no big thing but high". The artist and illustrator Julius Caesar Ibbetson painted the castle in 1792, depicting substantial remains and a prominent tower, with a lime kiln in operation alongside the fortification. Stone from the castle may have been robbed and used to feed the kilns during this period. A similar view was sketched by an unknown artist in the early 19th century, showing more trees around the ruins; a few years later, Robert Drane recommended the site as a place for picnics and noted its abundance in <b>wild</b> <b>garlic.</b>|$|E

60|$|I {{slept on}} a sofa in Arthur's room that night. Van Helsing {{did not go to}} bed at all. He went to and fro, as if patroling the house, and was never {{out of sight of the}} room where Lucy lay in her coffin, strewn with the <b>wild</b> <b>garlic</b> flowers, which sent through the odour of lily and rose, a heavy, overpowering smell into the night.|$|E

Then the Man went to sleep {{in front of the}} fire ever so happy; but the Woman sat up, combing her hair. She took the bone of the shoulder of mutton--the big fat blade-bone--and she looked at the wonderful marks on it, and she threw more wood on the fire, and she made a Magic.

There was nothing Mowgli liked better than, as he himself said, [...] "to pull the whiskers of Death," [...] and make the Jungle {{know that he was}} their overlord. He had often, with Baloo's help, robbed bees' nests in single trees, and he knew that the Little People hated the smell of <b>wild</b> <b>garlic.</b> So he gathered a small bundle of it, tied it up with a bark string, and then followed Won-tolla's blood-trail, as it ran southerly from the Lairs, for some five miles, looking at the trees with his head on one side, and chuckling as he looked.|$|E

60|$|Everywhere the {{wandering}} {{members of the}} great Peddlers' Guild carried word of me, of my comings and goings and doings, to Chong Mong-ju at Keijo. Only twice, in all the days after my downfall, did I meet Chong Mong-ju face to face. The first time was a wild winter night of storm in the high mountains of Kang-wun. A few hoarded coppers had bought for the Lady Om and me sleeping space in the dirtiest and coldest corner of the one large room of the inn. We were just about to begin on our meagre supper of horse-beans and <b>wild</b> <b>garlic</b> cooked into a stew with a scrap of bullock that must have died of old age, {{when there was a}} tinkling of bronze pony bells and the stamp of hoofs without. The doors opened, and entered Chong Mong-ju, the personification of well-being, prosperity and power, shaking the snow from his priceless Mongolian furs. Place was made for him and his dozen retainers, and there was room for all without crowding, when his eyes chanced to light on the Lady Om and me.|$|E
