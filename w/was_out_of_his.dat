5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us it <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hands, and go back on his word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Nuremberg, Hess was {{reluctant}} {{to give up some}} of his possessions, including samples of food he said had been poisoned by the British; he proposed to use these for his defence during the trial. The commandant of the facility, Colonel Burton C. Andrus of the United States Army, advised him that he would be allowed no special treatment; the samples were sealed and confiscated. Hess's diaries indicate that he did not acknowledge the validity of the court and felt the outcome was a foregone conclusion. He was thin when he arrived, weighing , and had a poor appetite, but was deemed to be in good health. As one defendant, Robert Ley, had managed to hang himself in his cell on 24 October, the remaining prisoners were monitored around the clock. Because of his previous suicide attempts, Hess was handcuffed to a guard whenever he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cell.|$|E
5|$|The program's {{producers}} and Brockman met {{to review the}} videotape. They noticed that Larson would immediately celebrate after many of his spins instead of waiting the {{fraction of a second}} it would take for a contestant to see and respond to the space he or she had stopped on, effectively showing he {{knew he was going to}} get something good. It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pattern – he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated after a pause.|$|E

5|$|The defence next {{engaged in}} a lengthy direct {{examination}} of Eichmann. Observers such as Moshe Pearlman and Hannah Arendt have remarked on Eichmann's ordinariness in appearance and flat affect. In his testimony throughout the trial, Eichmann insisted {{he had no choice}} but to follow orders, as he was bound by an oath of loyalty—the same superior orders defence used by some defendants in the 1945–1946 Nuremberg trials. Eichmann asserted that the decisions had been made not by him, but by Müller, Heydrich, Himmler, and ultimately Hitler. Servatius also proposed that decisions of the Nazi government were acts of state and therefore not subject to normal judicial proceedings. Regarding the Wannsee Conference, Eichmann stated that he felt a sense of satisfaction and relief at its conclusion. As a clear decision to exterminate had been made by his superiors, the matter <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hands; he felt absolved of any guilt. On the last day of the examination, he stated that he was guilty of arranging the transports, but he did not feel guilty for the consequences.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} rekindle Catherine's affection, Grigory {{presented}} to {{her one of}} the greater diamonds of the world, known ever since as the Orlov Diamond. When Grigory Potemkin, in 1771, superseded Vasil'chikov, Orlov became of no account at court and went abroad for some years. He returned to Russia a few months previously to his death, which took place at Moscow in 1783. For some time before his death he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mind. Late in life he married his niece, Madame Zinovyeva, but left no children by that marriage.|$|E

25|$|After {{the success}} of Bublé's self-titled debut, DRG Records belatedly {{released}} the soundtrack from the 2001 film, Totally Blonde {{in which he had}} a co-starring role as a nightclub singer and club owner. DRG ignored the music's connection to the film by altering the title and putting a shot of Bublé on the cover, making it appear as if this was a proper Michael Bublé release. The slight misrepresentation was not lost on Bublé, who stated on his website {{that he did not want}} these songs released but that it <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> control.|$|E
25|$|On 23rd June 2017, in a Twenty20 {{match against}} South Africa, Jason Roy of England was given out obstructing the field, for {{changing}} {{the side of the}} pitch he was running on when returning from backing up. This caused the returned ball to hit him when he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> crease, when it could conceivably have hit the stumps. The South African fielders immediately appealed for a dismissal. Responding to this, the on-field umpires called the ball dead and referred the decision to the third umpire, who gave Roy out.|$|E
25|$|Elliot was {{promoted}} to rear-admiral on 10 January 1837 and in September that year went out as commander-in-chief of the Cape of Good Hope Station. He was then sent to China in February 1840, during the First Opium War, as commander-in-chief East Indies and China Station and joint plenipotentiary with his cousin, Captain Charles Elliot. He oversaw operations between July and November, but his actions and negotiations were viewed by the foreign secretary, Lord Palmerston, as being irresolute and ineffective. Elliot himself admitted that he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> depth, and on his health deteriorating, returned to Britain in November.|$|E

25|$|Australia {{finally broke}} through when Flintoff misjudged {{the length of}} a straighter ball from Warne and was bowled. He was quickly {{followed}} by Geraint Jones; his dismal tour continued when he was run out in astounding fashion. Having failed in an attempt to sweep Warne, Jones was struck on the pad, resulting in an unsuccessful appeal for LBW from the Australians. Jones, however, was too preoccupied waiting for the umpire's verdict to notice that his back foot <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> batting crease. This fact did not escape an alert Ponting, however, who swooped in from silly point and underarmed the ball into the stumps. Jones was out for a duck – his second of the match.|$|E
25|$|Scarver {{alleges that}} {{immediately}} before murdering Dahmer, he had cornered him, presented {{a newspaper article}} detailing Dahmer's crimes, and demanded that Dahmer answer whether the account was true. Scarver further alleged he had been revolted by Dahmer's crimes and that Dahmer had been openly unrepentant for his crimes; that Dahmer taunted prison employees and fellow inmates by shaping his prison food into imitations of severed limbs, complete with ketchup to simulate blood spattering; and that prison staff, knowing of Scarver's hatred for Dahmer, had deliberately left the two men unsupervised {{so that he could}} kill him. Furthermore, Scarver stated that Dahmer was so disliked by fellow inmates that he required a personal escort of at least one guard whenever he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cell to prevent inmates from attacking him.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon did {{not expect}} the Austrians to declare war, but when {{it became obvious that}} war was imminent, he {{believed}} that hostilities would start after 15 April. From Paris, Napoleon ordered Marshal Louis-Alexandre Berthier to form the Grande Armée d'Allemagne (Grand Army of Germany) from French and Allied units located on the Danube front. To Berthier he sent orders to concentrate at Regensburg if the Austrians invaded Bavaria after 15 April. If, however, his enemies attacked before the deadline, the army was to assemble farther west at Donauwörth. By misfortune, an order that Napoleon sent on 10 April did not arrive until the 16th. A second order, elaborating on the first order, arrived late on the 13th. Berthier was an excellent chief of staff to Napoleon, but as an army commander he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> element. In the confusion, he misinterpreted the out-of-sequence instructions and ordered a forward concentration at Regensburg.|$|E

25|$|On November 1, 1924, Baker {{received}} {{a tip from}} an anonymous source, {{believed to be a}} gang member's girlfriend (or a disgruntled brother-in-law), that Ashley would be travelling up the coast on the Dixie Highway to rob a bank in Jacksonville. That same day, Baker arranged an ambush at the bridge over the St. Sebastian River, at Roseland, blocking the road with a chain with a red lantern across the bridge. As the bridge <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> jurisdiction, the actual operation was overseen by the sheriff of Indian River County, J.R. Merritt, along with three of Baker's deputies. An hour after the ambush was laid, Ashley's black touring car was spotted. Once it stopped at the bridge, the deputies approached the car from behind and ordered the gang out of the vehicle. According to the official story, the deputies searched the car and found several guns while Ashley, Ray Lynn, Hanford Mobley, and Clarence Middleton were lined up outside the car. John Ashley then pulled out a concealed weapon, causing the deputies to open fire. Ashley and his three partners were killed in the shootout.|$|E
25|$|After Uman Budyonny's forces massed around Kiev – over 700,000 men – {{were left}} dangerously exposed, with Kleist's 1st Panzer Army {{regrouping}} to the south-east and General Heinz Guderian's 2nd Panzer Army (part of Army Group Centre) smashing General Yeromenko's Briansk Front and advancing south from Gomel in White Russia, {{on a line}} well east of Kiev. The danger of encirclement was obvious, but Stalin stubbornly refused to consider withdrawal, despite warnings from both Budyonny and Kirponos that catastrophe was imminent. Budyonny has been freely blamed by postwar writers for the disaster at Kiev, {{but it is clear}} that while he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> depth as a front commander, he warned Stalin of the danger, and was dismissed for his pains. On 12 September Kleist crossed the Dnieper at Cherkasy heading north-east, and on 16 September his tanks linked up with Guderian's at Lokhvitsa, nearly 200km east of Kiev. Although many Soviet troops were able to escape eastwards in small groups, around 600,000 men – four whole armies comprising 43 divisions, nearly one-third of the Soviet Army's strength at the start of the war – were killed or captured, and the great majority of those captured died in captivity. Kiev fell on 19 September. Kirponos was killed in action on 20 September, shortly before resistance ceased.|$|E
25|$|Lévesque later sent {{a letter}} to Buckingham Palace asking the Queen to refuse Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Trudeau's advice that she open the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, though she did not oblige the premier, as he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{jurisdiction}} in offering advice to the sovereign on a federal matter. The premier at the time, Robert Bourassa, who had first pushed Trudeau to ask the Queen to attend, eventually himself became unsettled about how unpopular the move might be with sovereigntists. In 2002, Premier Bernard Landry directed the executive council and lieutenant governor not to recognise Elizabeth's golden jubilee, in protest of the Queen's signing of the Constitution Act, 1982; separatist demonstrators met the Queen when she entered Gatineau that year. PQ members of the National Assembly of Quebec also complained in 2006 about federal intervention into a provincial affair and separatists threatened demonstrations after both the city and provincial governments mused about inviting the Queen or another member of the Royal Family to attend the festivities marking the quatercentenary of the founding of Quebec City, as had been done a century prior. Though it was met with dissatisfation from some officials in Quebec, but with support from 64% of polled individuals in the province, the federal government advised neither the sovereign nor any other Royal Family member to attend, instead sending Governor General Michaëlle Jean to preside over the fête. The Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society and Réseau de Résistance du Québécois (RRQ) mounted demonstrations and threw eggs at Canadian soldiers during the visit of Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, to the Black Watch Regiment in Montreal, on Remembrance Day, 2009, requiring the intervention of riot police. The RRQ mounted similar, though less violent, protests when Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, visited Montreal and Quebec City in 2011.|$|E

25|$|Barrington {{was chosen}} to manage the {{forthcoming}} tour of Pakistan in the first season of the WSC, both sides losing players as a result. Phil Edmonds and Paul Downton were taken on the tour, Downton on Barrington's advice after playing only a few county games and he gave Edmonds was long practise sessions in the nets to improve his spin bowling. The team arrived {{in the wake of}} General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's military coup displacing Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the country {{was in a state of}} high tension and disorder. In the First Test 40,000 Bhutto supporters rioted at the ground and the teams took refuge in their dressing rooms as the army restored order. The TCCB gave Barrington permission to cancel the tour if he saw fit and realising this the players urged him to let them go home for Christmas. In the Second Test England collapsed in the first innings to the leg-spinner Abdul Qadir (6/44), but Barrington bowled his own leg-spin at Brearley and Boycott for an hour before the second innings and their 185 opening stand saved the game. The Third Test was surrounded by controversy as Pakistan wanted brought in their WSC players Zaheer Abbas, Mushtaq Mohammad and Imran Khan to win a series victory in the last Test. This would have given them an edge over an England team without its WSC veterans. Several England players led by the vice-captain Geoff Boycott, Bob Willis and Derek Randall refused to play Pakistan with their Packer players and Barrington and Brearley tried to negotiate between the players, the TCCB and the Pakistani cricket authorities. Matters were made worst by Mike Brearley breaking his arm and returning to England, leaving the uncompromising Boycott as captain and Willis as vice-captain. Fortunately, the Pakistani players could only play by breaking their WSC contracts, which they refused to do, and the Test was drawn. Barrington <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> depth in these political matters, even though Willis later admitted that his determination for the Test to be played regardless was the right course.|$|E
