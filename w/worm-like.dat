5|$|Driller, a giant <b>worm-like</b> and tentacled Decepticon and Shockwave's pet.|$|E
5|$|Bigfin reef squids {{serve as}} hosts to the copepod {{ectoparasite}} Doridicola similis and the <b>worm-like</b> dicyemid endoparasites Dicyema koshidai and Dicyema orientale.|$|E
5|$|Microcerberidea – Tiny, <b>worm-like</b> isopods {{that live}} between {{particles}} {{on the bed}} of freshwater and shallow marine habitats.|$|E
5|$|Fleas lay tiny, white, oval eggs. The larvae {{are small}} and pale, have {{bristles}} covering their <b>worm-like</b> bodies, lack eyes, and have mouth parts adapted to chewing. The larvae feed on organic matter, especially the feces of mature fleas, which contain dried blood. Adults feed only on fresh blood.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to basic troops, there are Hunters, or Mgalekgolo, (from the planet Te) who according to Bungie's mythology are collectives of <b>worm-like</b> aliens, singularly known as Lekgolo, encased in tough armor. Initial concepts were less humanoid-looking and softer than the final shape, with angular shields and razor-sharp spines.|$|E
5|$|Holometabolism, or {{complete}} metamorphosis, {{is where the}} insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally <b>worm-like</b> in form. This <b>worm-like</b> form {{can be one of}} several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin. Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well-known example of insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, although most insects use this life cycle. Some insects have evolved this system to hypermetamorphosis.|$|E
5|$|Pterobranchs {{may be a}} {{sub-group}} of enteropneusts ("acorn worms"). This {{suggests that}} the ancestral deuterostome {{looks more like a}} mobile <b>worm-like</b> enteropneust than a sessile colonial pterobranch. The fact that lophophorates and pterobranchs both use tentacles for feeding is probably not a synapomorphy of lophophorates and deuterostomes, but evolved independently as convergent adaptations to a sessile lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The living {{members of}} the Diplopoda are divided into sixteen orders in two {{subclass}}es. The basal subclass Penicillata contains a single order, Polyxenida (bristle millipedes). All other millipedes belong to the subclass Chilognatha consisting of two infraclasses: Pentazonia, containing the short-bodied pill millipedes, and Helminthomorpha (<b>worm-like</b> millipedes), containing {{the great majority of}} the species.|$|E
5|$|Spoo is {{a fictional}} {{foodstuff}} {{that served as}} a running joke within the Babylon 5 science fiction television series. In the series' fictional universe, spoo is made from <b>worm-like</b> creatures of the same name and is generally regarded as the most delicious food in the galaxy; the creature itself, however, is regarded with contempt by most species. Despite appearing only in a few episodes, spoo was embraced by fans and became part of the series' extended mythology.|$|E
5|$|The game's main enemy {{force is}} the Covenant, {{a group of}} alien species allied by belief in a common religion. Their forces include Elites, fierce warriors {{protected}} by recharging energy shields much like the player's own; Grunts, which are short, comically cowardly creatures who are usually led by Elites in battle, and often flee in terror instead of fighting {{in the absence of}} a leading Elite; Jackals, originally space pirates, they wear a highly durable energy shield on one arm and a form of handgun on the other; and Hunters, large, powerful creatures composed of small <b>worm-like</b> colonies with thick armor plates that cover the majority of their bodies and a large assault cannon that fires explosive rounds of green plasma.|$|E
5|$|The gastrotrichs (phylum Gastrotricha), {{commonly}} referred to as hairybacks, are a group of microscopic (0.06-3.0mm), <b>worm-like,</b> pseudocoelomate animals, and are widely distributed and abundant in freshwater and marine environments. They are mostly benthic and live within the periphyton, the layer of tiny organisms and detritus that is found on the seabed and the beds of other water bodies. The majority live on and between particles of sediment or on other submerged surfaces, but a few species are terrestrial and live on land in the film of water surrounding grains of soil. Gastrotrichs are divided into two orders, the Macrodasyida which are marine (except for two species), and the Chaetonotida, some of which are marine and some freshwater. Nearly eight hundred species of gastrotrich have been described.|$|E
5|$|Certain planes feature aggressive, multi-segmented {{creatures that}} perish {{when all of}} their {{segments}} are eaten by the player's creature; however, they can eat segments of the player's creature to regrow their own. These creatures release many cells upon death, which can restore {{the health of the}} player's creature, temporarily increase the size of its mouth, or cause it to sprout decorative protrusions. Players are not required to eat these or any other organisms; they may travel to higher or lower planes at any time. Being defeated by aggressive creatures does not result in death, but causes the player's creature to float to a higher plane. In the Flash version, the player can replay the game with a jellyfish-like organism by defeating an aggressive creature on the bottom plane. If the player reaches the bottom again, the creature there is their original <b>worm-like</b> creature, and defeating it starts the game over as that organism.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at Kini Nui, a great temple at the island's centre, Jaller and Takua {{are confronted}} by all six Rahkshi. The six Toa mount a united {{offensive}} and defeat five of them, but a surviving Rahkshi attacks Takua. Jaller sacrifices himself to protect Takua, and Jaller's final words prompt Takua to don the Mask of Light: the Mask transforms him into Takanuva, the Toa of Light. Defeating the final Rakhshi, he constructs a craft {{powered by the}} <b>worm-like</b> creatures inside the Rahkshi to guide him to Makuta. Traveling to his lair beneath Mata Nui, the two hold a Kohlii contest for the island's fate. At Takanuva's bidding, the Toa, Turaga and Matoran gather together in the chamber, and witness Takanuva merging with Makuta to form a single powerful being. With Takanuva's willpower dominant, the being raises a gate leading deeper beneath the island, through which the gathered people flee. The being also revives Jaller before the gate collapses on top of it. The Turaga proceed to awaken Mata Nui using the Mask of Light, which in turn revives Takanuva. The film ends with Takanuva discovering , the Matoran's original home.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>worm-like</b> animals such {{as certain}} Polychaeta in the genus Myrianida, form stolons {{containing}} eggs or sperm that they trail behind the main body.|$|E
25|$|In Dougal Dixon's After Man a toad {{known as}} the Oak Leaf Toad, whose tongue is {{described}} as <b>worm-like,</b> is known by the scientific name Grima frondiforme.|$|E
25|$|A typical ambush predator, it waits {{patiently for}} unsuspecting prey to wander by. Sometimes, {{it is known}} to select a {{specific}} ambush site and return to it every year {{in time for the}} spring migration of birds. Studies have indicated that B. schlegeli learns to improve strike accuracy over time. Sometimes B. schlegelii (especially juveniles) will employ what is known as “caudal luring”, wiggling the tail in <b>worm-like</b> motions to encourage potential prey to move within striking range.|$|E
25|$|Most adult mites {{have four}} pairs of legs, like other arachnids, but some have fewer. For example, gall mites like Phyllocoptes variabilis (family Eriophyidae) have a <b>worm-like</b> body {{with only two}} pairs of legs; some {{parasitic}} mites have only one or three pairs of legs in the adult stage. Larval and prelarval stages have a maximum of three pairs of legs; adult mites with only three pairs of legs may be called 'larviform'. Also members of the Nematalycidae within Endeostigmata, which live between sand grains, have often wormlike and elongated bodies with reduced legs.|$|E
25|$|D. folliculorum is a semi-transparent, {{elongated}} organism {{consisting of}} a head, neck, body, and tail. D. folliculorum is <b>worm-like,</b> with tiny claws, and scales over their entire body which allows it to anchor itself in the hair follicles. As an adult, D. folliculorum can measure 0.1mm to 0.4mm in length and possess four pairs of short legs near its head and neck region. However, as a larva and/or nymph, D. folliculorum resembles the adult but has three pairs of short legs near its head and neck region. The body and tail region of D. folliculorum is striated.|$|E
25|$|Helminths are <b>worm-like</b> organisms {{living in}} and feeding on living hosts, {{receiving}} nourishment and protection while disrupting their hosts' nutrient absorption, causing weakness and disease. Those that live inside {{the digestive tract}} are called intestinal parasites. They can live inside humans and other animals. In their adult form, helminths cannot multiply in humans. Helminths are able to survive in their mammalian hosts for many years due {{to their ability to}} manipulate the immune response by secreting immunomodulatory products. Helminth ova (or eggs) have a strong shell that protects the eggs against a range of environmental conditions.|$|E
25|$|Native fauna {{species have}} been greatly reduced by past {{agricultural}} practices and the introduced rabbit is now common. Eastern bearded dragons, White's skink, eastern brown snake, and sleepy lizard reptile species are seen; a total of twenty {{species have been}} seen within the park. Black-shouldered kites and nankeen kestrels hunt over the grasslands. red-rumped parrots and crested pigeons are seen feeding {{on the ground and}} wattlebirds, musk lorikeets, noisy miners and honeyeaters in the flowering gums and along creeklines. The park is home to a small population of the <b>worm-like</b> and vulnerable Flinders Ranges worm-lizard (Aprasia pseudopulchella).|$|E
25|$|Just as some prey species evolved cryptic {{colouration}} {{and patterns}} to help avoid predators, some ambush predators evolved camouflage that lets them ambush their prey. The tassled scorpionfish is an ambush predator {{that looks like}} part of a sea floor encrusted with coral and algae. It lies in wait on the sea floor for crustaceans and small fish, such as gobies, to pass by. Another ambush predator is the striated frogfish (right). They lie {{on the bottom and}} wave a conspicuous <b>worm-like</b> lure strategically attached above their mouth. Normally about 10cm (4in) long, they can also inflate themselves like puffers.|$|E
25|$|The zygote remains {{inactive}} for sometime {{but it soon}} elongates, becomes vermiform (<b>worm-like)</b> and motile. It is {{now known}} as ookinete. The pointed ends of ookinete penetrate the stomach wall and come to lie below its outer epithelial layer. Here the zygote becomes spherical and develops a cyst wall around itself. The cyst wall is derived partly from the stomach tissues and partly produced by the zygote itself. At this stage, the zygote is known as an oocyst. The oocyst absorbs nourishment and grows in size. Oocysts protrude from the surface of stomach, giving it a blistered appearance. In a highly infected mosquito, as many as 1000 oocysts may be seen.|$|E
25|$|These include {{displaying}} two-dimensional {{and even}} three-dimensional plots of shot directions and distances on an overhead {{view of a}} cricket field, {{commonly referred to as}} a Wagon-Wheel. Other forms include graphs of run scoring and wicket taking numbers plotted against time or balls bowled over a career or within a match. These graphics can be changed dynamically through a computer-controlled back-end, as statistics evolve during a game. Commonly used graphics, especially during a limited-over match, are a worm graph, called so, for the <b>worm-like</b> appearance of the teams' score progression as the overs progress; and; a Manhattan Chart, called so, for its resemblance to the Manhattan skyline.|$|E
25|$|Mud {{was laid}} {{down on top}} of the Flathead Sandstone as the {{shoreline}} advanced eastward across the Teton area. The resulting soft greenish-gray shale with beds of purple and green sandstone near its base, became the 100 feet (30 m) thick Wolsey Shale Member of the Gros Ventre Formation. Some shale shows patterns of cracks that formed when the accumulating mud was briefly exposed to the air along tidal flats. Small phosphatic-shelled animals called brachiopods inhabited these tidal flats but as far as is known, nothing lived on land. Many shale beds are marked with faint trails and borings of <b>worm-like</b> creatures, and a few contain the remains of tiny trilobites.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the fossils}} are found as {{impressions}} of soft-bodied organisms {{in the shape}} of disks, ribbons or fronds. There are also trace fossils that provide evidence that some of these Precambrian organisms were most-likely <b>worm-like</b> creatures that were locomotive. Most of these fossils lack any recognizable heads, mouths or digestive organs, and are thought to have fed via absorptive mechanisms and symbiotic relationships with chemoautotrophs (Chemotroph), photoautotrophs (Phototroph) or osmoautotrophs. The ribbon-like fossils resemble tentacled organisms, and are thought to have fed by capturing prey. The frondose fossils resemble sea pens and other cnidarians. The trace fossils suggest that there were annelid type creatures, and the disk fossils resemble sponges. Despite these similarities, much of the identification is speculation since the fossils do not show very distinct structures. Other fossils do not resemble any known lineages.|$|E
25|$|Synchrotron X-ray tomographic {{analysis}} of early Cambrian bilaterian embryonic microfossils yielded new insights of metazoan evolution at its earliest stages. The tomography technique provides previously unattainable three-dimensional resolution at {{the limits of}} fossilization. Fossils of two enigmatic bilaterians, the <b>worm-like</b> Markuelia and a putative, primitive protostome, Pseudooides, provide a peek at germ layer embryonic development. These 543-million-year-old embryos support the emergence of some aspects of arthropod development earlier than previously thought in the late Proterozoic. The preserved embryos from China and Siberia underwent rapid diagenetic phosphatization resulting in exquisite preservation, including cell structures. This research is a notable example of how knowledge encoded by the fossil record continues to contribute otherwise unattainable information on the emergence and development of life on Earth. For example, the research suggests Markuelia has closest affinity to priapulid worms, and is adjacent to the evolutionary branching of Priapulida, Nematoda and Arthropoda.|$|E

500|$|Rhinogrades are mammals {{characterized}} by a nose-like feature called a nasorium, the form and function of which vary significantly between species. According to Stümpke, the order's remarkable variety was the natural outcome of evolution acting {{over millions of years}} in the remote Hy-yi-yi islands. All the 14 families and 189 known snouter species descended from a small shrew-like animal, which gradually evolved and diversified to fill most of the ecological niches in the archipelago [...] from tiny <b>worm-like</b> beings to large herbivores and predators.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, she {{obtained}} {{her first}} film role playing Heather Gummer in the horror comedy Tremors, along with Kevin Bacon. The film {{told the story}} {{of a small group of}} people living in Nevada who were fighting subterranean <b>worm-like</b> creatures. After the film's release, McEntire developed a strong interest in acting and made it her second career. The following year, she starred along with Kenny Rogers and Burt Reynolds in the made-for-television movies, [...] and The Man From Left Field. In 1994, McEntire worked with director, Rob Reiner in the film, North, playing Ma Tex. The film obtained negative reviews, receiving only two and a half stars from Allmovie.|$|E
500|$|The spores remain dormant {{inside the}} {{sporocarp}} through unfavorable conditions, but when conditions are suitable and wet, the sporocarp will germinate. [...] It splits into halves, allowing the tissue coiled inside to become hydrated. [...] As this internal tissue swells with water, it pushes the {{halves of the}} hard outer covering apart, and emerges as a long gelatinous <b>worm-like</b> sorophore. [...] The sorophore is a sorus-bearing structure unique to the Marsileaceae; it may extend to more than ten times {{the length of the}} sporocarp inside which it was coiled. [...] This extension carries the numerous spore-producing sori attached along each side of the sorophore out into the water.|$|E
500|$|Out of bullets, Patricia {{strangles}} Frank to death, but Frank {{in spirit}} form rips Patricia's spirit from her body, forcing Bartlett to follow them. Bartlett grabs Patricia's ghost, while Frank {{makes it to}} Heaven, where he is reunited with Cyrus and Stuart, {{along with his wife}} Debra. Bartlett and Patricia's spirits claim they will now go back to claim more lives, but the portal to Heaven quickly changes to a demonic looking appearance, and they are both dragged to Hell by a giant <b>worm-like</b> creature. Frank learns it is not yet his time and is sent back to his body, as Debra's spirit tells him to [...] "be happy." ...|$|E
500|$|Fleas {{are small}} flightless insects {{that form the}} order Siphonaptera. As {{external}} parasites of mammals and birds, they live by consuming the blood of their hosts. Adults are up to about [...] long and usually brown. Bodies flattened sideways enable them to move through their host's fur or feathers; strong claws prevent them from being dislodged. They lack wings, and have mouthparts adapted for piercing skin and sucking blood and hind legs adapted for jumping. The latter enable them to leap a distance of some 50 times their body length, a feat second only to jumps made by froghoppers. Larvae are <b>worm-like</b> with no limbs; they have chewing mouthparts and feed on organic debris.|$|E
500|$|Conway Morris gave Hallucigenia {{its name}} because in his {{reconstruction}} it looked bizarre – a <b>worm-like</b> animal that walked on long, rigid spines {{and had a}} row of tentacles along its back. Science fiction author Greg Bear says the Jarts in his The Way stories were scaled-up versions of this reconstruction. However, in the late 1980s Lars Ramsköld literally turned it over, so that the tentacles, which he found were paired, became legs and the spines were defensive equipment on its back. Ramsköld classified {{it as one of}} the Onychophora, a phylum of [...] "worms with legs" [...] that is considered closely related to arthropods. Another current view is that Hallucigenia was an armored lobopod, in other words more closely related to arthropods than the onychophorans are, but less closely related to arthropods than Opabinia or Anomalocaris are.|$|E
500|$|After she regains consciousness, Jill {{proceeds}} {{towards the}} Raccoon Park {{and enters the}} park caretaker's cabin. There, she runs into Nicholai, who is alive. Nicholai is revealed {{to be one of}} the [...] "supervisors" [...] sent into Raccoon City to gather combat data of Umbrella's bio-weapons. Nicholai retreats, and Jill is confronted by a massive <b>worm-like</b> creature. Jill defeats the creature and escapes to an abandoned factory at the rear of the park. Inside the factory, Jill meets up with Carlos, who tells her that the US government is planning to launch a nuclear missile into Raccoon City to eradicate the T-Virus infestation. After confronting Nemesis and grabbing a keycard needed to escape, Jill learns from the factory's control tower that the missile attack on Raccoon City has begun, with only a short time left before the city is destroyed.|$|E
500|$|Actor James Doohan {{claimed that}} Paramount chief Frank Mancuso had fired Bennett {{following}} negative {{reaction from the}} core cast, Roddenberry, and fans. Bennett claimed that after he rewrote the script to include Shatner and Nimoy, Paramount had still rejected it and that he {{decided it was time}} he left the franchise. He said, [...] "My term was up. I was offered $1.5million to do Star Trek VI and I said 'Thanks, I don't want to do that. I want to do the Academy.'" [...] Actor Walter Koenig approached Mancuso with a new script outline codenamed [...] "In Flanders Fields"; in it, the Romulans join the Federation and go to war with the Klingons. The Enterprise crew, except Spock, are forced to retire for not meeting fitness tests. When Spock and his new crew are captured by a monstrous <b>worm-like</b> race of aliens (which Koenig described as [...] "things that the monsters in Aliens evolved from"), the old crew must rescue them. In the end, all of the characters except McCoy and Spock die.|$|E
500|$|Two {{new forms}} of antlion appear in the game. The first is the glow-in-the-dark antlion grub, a harmless, <b>worm-like</b> {{creature}} which functions as a minor health pickup and a light source. Killing all 333 of these earns an Achievement. The second is the worker antlion (or 'acidlion') whose body produces a powerful and poisonous acid. In addition to a ranged acid spit attack, they also explode when killed, launching acid around them in a short radius, making them dangerous close-combat opponents. Although they are thematically similar to the bullsquids of the original Half-Life, they are functionally closer to the poison headcrab—as an enemy that the player will instinctively prioritize as a target. A new antlion guardian, which has glow-in-the-dark features, was also added. This [...] "Guardian" [...] hunts and attacks Gordon Freeman as the player endeavors to take the larval extract the Guardian protects. The vortigaunt that accompanies the player forbids him from harming the guardian, fearing the extract will be ruined if he does. The player must therefore accomplish his goal while being harried by a creature he cannot eliminate, though the player is eventually {{given the chance to}} kill it.|$|E
