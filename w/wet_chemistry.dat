25|$|NMR spectra are unique, well-resolved, {{analytically}} tractable {{and often}} highly predictable for small molecules. Thus, in organic chemistry practice, NMR analysis {{is used to}} confirm {{the identity of a}} substance.

NMR has largely replaced traditional <b>wet</b> <b>chemistry</b> tests such as color reagents or typical chromatography for identification. A disadvantage is that a relatively large amount, 2–50mg, of a purified substance is required, although it may be recovered through a workup. Preferably, the sample should be dissolved in a solvent, because NMR analysis of solids requires a dedicated MAS machine and may not give equally well-resolved spectra. The timescale of NMR is relatively long, and thus it is not suitable for observing fast phenomena, producing only an averaged spectrum. Although large amounts of impurities do show on an NMR spectrum, better methods exist for detecting impurities, as NMR is inherently not very sensitive - though at higher frequencies, sensitivity is higher.|$|E

40|$|Wet {{processes}} are gaining {{a renewed interest}} for removal of high dose ion implanted photoresist (II-PR) in front-end-of-line semiconductor manufacturing because of their excellent selectivity towards the wafer substrate and gate materials. The selection of <b>wet</b> <b>chemistries</b> is supported by an insight into the resist degradation by ion implantation. In this work, different analytical techniques have been applied for in-depth characterization of the chemical changes in 248 nm DUV PR after arsenic implantation. A radical mechanism of resist degradation is proposed involving cross-linking and chain scission reactions. The cross-linking of the resist is dominant especially for high doses and energies. It leads to significant depletion of hydrogen and formation of carbon macroradicals that recombine to form C-C cross-linked crust. Moreover, formation of ab-unsaturated ketonic and/or quinonoid structures by cross-linking reactions is suggested. In addition, the dopant species may provide rigid points in the PR matrix by chemical bonding with the resist. For higher doses and energies further dehydrogenation occurs, which leads to formation of triple bonds in the crust. Different p-conjugated structures are formed in the crust by cross-linking and dehydrogenation reactions. No presence of amorphous carbon in the crust is revealed.

40|$|A carbon {{nanotube}} is a graphitic sheet, rolled into a one-dimensional, hollow tube. This structure provides certain individual nanotubes with high conductivity and near-infrared optical activity. These properties {{are not necessarily}} translated at the macroscale, however, due to strong van der Waals attractive forces that determine the behavior at the bulk level - exemplified by aggregation of nanotubes into bundles with significantly attenuated functionality. Different methods of {{carbon nanotube}} covalent functionalization are studied to improve dispersion while simultaneously maintaining intrinsic electrical and optical properties. In addition to retention of known behavior, new carbon nanotube photoluminescence pathways are also revealed {{as a result of}} this same covalent functionalization strategy. With various <b>wet</b> <b>chemistries,</b> including super-acid oxidation, the Billups-Birch reaction, and various diazonium based reactions, that utilize strong reducing or oxidizing conditions to spontaneously exfoliate aggregated carbon nanotubes, we are able to covalently functionalize individually dispersed nanotubes in a highly scalable manner. Covalent addition to the nanotube sidewalls converts the native sp 2 hybridized carbon atoms to sp 3 hybridization, which helps disrupt inter-tube van der Waals forces. However, this change in hybridization also perturbs the carbon nanotube electronic structure, resulting in an undesired loss of electrical conductivity and optical activity. We observe that controlling the location of functionalization, such as to the outer-walls of double-walled carbon nanotubes or as discrete functional "bands," we avert the loss of desirable properties by leaving significant tracts of sp 2 carbon atoms unperturbed. We also demonstrate that such functional groups can act as electron and hole traps through the creation of a potential well deviation in the carbon nanotube electronic structure.

This reduction in dimensions makes surface preparation an increasingly important part of the device fabrication process. The atoms or molecules that terminate surfaces function as passivation layers, diffusion barriers, and nucleation layers. In the back end of line, metal layers are deposited to connect transistors. We demonstrate a reproducible process that deposits a monolayer of aminopropyltrimethoxysilane molecules less than one nanometer thick on a silicon dioxide surface. The monolayer contains a high density of amine groups {{that can be used to}} deposit Pd and Ni and subsequently Co and Cu to serve as the nucleation layer in an electroless metal deposition process.
