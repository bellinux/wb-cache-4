5|$|The {{condition}} of foreign domestic <b>workers</b> <b>is</b> being increasingly scrutinised by human-rights groups and criticised as tantamount to modern slavery. Documented cases of worker abuse, including the successful prosecution of an employer for subjecting Erwiana Sulistyaningsih to grievous bodily harm, assault, criminal intimidation and unpaid wages, are increasing in number.

5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes {{feel that they are}} not part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the <b>workers</b> <b>is</b> brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{patterns}} {{suggest that}} green-head ant workers mate with unrelated males from distant colonies. The relatedness among <b>workers</b> <b>is</b> also very low, {{and there is}} a high proportion of gamergate ants. If the gamergates are all unrelated, the number of gamergates living in a nest can reach as many as nine; all of these gamergates contribute to the reproduction of young. The average number of gamergates can still be very high if they are related and get a larger share in reproduction. Most of the time, however, gamergates are generally unrelated, and it is uncommon for them to have a degree of relatedness. In many colonies, workers and gamergates police young females, which prevents them from reproducing.|$|E

30|$|Before 1978, the {{construction}} industry used the relative easy production methods with brick and concrete structures, combining semi-industrial and on-site prefabrication.

50|$|Workers {{and major}} <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> mostly {{coloured}} orange. <b>Workers</b> <b>are</b> 5 - 6 mm long; they look after larvae and farm scale bugs for honeydew. Major <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> 8 - 10 mm long, with long strong legs and large mandibles. They forage, assemble {{and expand the}} nest. Queens are typically 20 - 25 mm long, and normally greenish-brown.|$|R
5|$|In the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator, worker {{policing}} {{prevents the}} number of reproductive workers from becoming excessive. The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having {{too many of them}} would reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers by jumping on and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, and within a few weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile workers. However, once new ovipositing workers attain a gamergate's level of ovarian activity, the infertile (policing) workers ignore them. The signal used by the policing workers consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather than being a pheromone detected by olfaction. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing <b>workers</b> <b>is</b> achieved by direct physical aggression by policing workers, not by any pheromone produced by queens or gamergates.|$|E
5|$|Once a queen has {{excavated}} a chamber, {{she will}} lay around 20 eggs that develop into larvae {{in less than}} a month. These eggs take 44 to 61 days to fully develop and emerge as adults. Mature nests range in size, from a few hundred to over 300,000 workers. Most colonies are monogyne, meaning it only has a single queen, but some colonies can have as many as four. Oligogynous colonies also exist, in which multiple queens are present, but they are tolerated equally by workers birthed from different mothers and antagonism exists among queens. Brood discrimination is known based on recognition of kin, and queens will look after their own brood and neglect other brood laid by different queens. Queens display intolerance to each other when the first generation of <b>workers</b> <b>is</b> present, and the queens will separate from each other once the colony grows to a certain size.|$|E
5|$|The larvae grow {{through a}} series of four or five moults and enter the pupal stage. The pupa has the {{appendages}} free and not fused to the body as in a butterfly pupa. The differentiation into queens and workers (which are both female), and different castes of <b>workers,</b> <b>is</b> influenced in some species by the nutrition the larvae obtain. Genetic influences and the control of gene expression by the developmental environment are complex and the determination of caste continues to be a subject of research. Winged male ants, called drones, emerge from pupae along with the usually winged breeding females. Some species, such as army ants, have wingless queens. Larvae and pupae need to be kept at fairly constant temperatures to ensure proper development, and so often, are moved around among the various brood chambers within the colony.|$|E

5|$|Both {{independent}} and dependent colony foundation can occur after mating. Isolation by distance (IBD) patterns {{have been recorded}} with M. pilosula queens, where nests that tend to be closer together were more genetically {{related to each other}} in comparison to other nests further away. Independent colony foundation is closely associated with queens which engage in nuptial flight in areas far from their home colony, showing that dependent colony foundation mostly occurs if they mate near their nest. In some cases, queens could seek adoption into alien colonies if there are no suitable areas to find a nest or independent colony foundation cannot be carried out. Other queens could try and return to their home nest after nuptial flight, but they may end up in another nest near the nest they originally came from. In multiple-queen societies, the egg-laying queens are generally unrelated to one another, but one study showed that it is possible for multiple queens in the same colony to be genetically related to each other. Depending on the species, the number of individuals present in a colony can range from 50 to over 2,200 individuals. A colony with less than 100 <b>workers</b> <b>is</b> not considered a mature colony. M. dispar colonies have around 15 to 329 ants, M. nigrocincta have over 1,000, M. pyriformis have from 200 to over 1,400 and M. gulosa have nearly 1,600. A colony can last for a number of years. Foraging behaviour among smaller workers which never usually leave the nest can be a sign of a colony's impending demise.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} several decades, the mass African American burial site in West Palm Beach was largely {{forgotten}} by the public. The city later sold the property, which switched ownership over the years. In 1991, the property was owned by a private individual when the Sankofa Society conducted a blessing ceremony at the site, well-publicized by the local media. Around that time, Robert Hazard, a resident of West Palm Beach, established the Storm of '28 Memorial Park Coalition Inc. to fight for recognition of the black victims of the storm. In December2000, the city of West Palm Beach purchased the land back for $180,000. Plans for construction of a memorial began. The site was designated a U.S. National Register of Historic Places and a historical marker was added in 2003 during the 75th anniversary of the hurricane. The inequity has caused ongoing racial friction that still exists. The effects of the hurricane on black migrant <b>workers</b> <b>is</b> dramatized in Zora Neale Hurston's novel Their Eyes Were Watching God.|$|E
5|$|Female banded sugar ants {{are easily}} {{recognised}} by their black head, orange thorax and the orange-brown band that wraps around their gaster. Males {{of the species}} are completely black. The dark sides of the thorax and legs are ferruginous (rusty in colour). The scape (the base of the antenna) and mandibles are black, and the head is wider than the thorax. The thorax is longer than its total width and slightly compressed, and the gaster is covered with tiny black dots. Erect setae are golden in colour and absent under the head but present on the mesosoma. The setae on the tibia and scape are shorter than those on the mesosoma. The anterior of the gaster is lighter in colour compared to the posterior, and the dorsum of the mesosoma is outlined and curved. A worker's metanotum is absent and the eyes are bulging, while a soldier's metanotum is noticeable and the eyes are flat. The wings on the queen are dark, and the stigmata and nerves are yellow. While many ant species have a metapleural gland, the gland is not present in the banded sugar ant; the number of malpighian tubules in <b>workers</b> <b>is</b> 21.|$|E
5000|$|Wages: In capitalism, <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> rewarded {{according}} to their contract with their employer.

In this sense, all paid employment is exploitation and the <b>worker</b> <b>is</b> [...] "alienated" [...] from their work.

5|$|Most colonies are monogyne, {{meaning that}} a colony {{only has a}} single queen, but based on observations, some nests contain {{more than a single}} queen. Some nests are known to contain two queens, with some even having as many as four in a single colony, making them polygynous; a high {{proportion}} of queens living in polygynous nests are unrelated to one another. Some colonies are oligogynous, which means that multiple queens are present in a colony, but they are tolerated by all workers birthed from different queens and treated equally. Tolerance still occurs even when new reproductive females and males are born, but recognition based on kin from queens and <b>workers</b> <b>is</b> known, hinting brood discrimination when the larvae are fed or groomed; queens will only take care of their own brood and neglect to look after broods laid by other queens. The queens, on the other hand, will only cooperate with each other during nest founding, but will be antagonistic once there are workers present in the colony. Queens become more intolerant of each other as the colony grows, and eventually separate within the nest, resulting in the queen laying more eggs. Such cases usually happen when pleometrotic founding occurs, or if a queen ant is adopted by a colony, setting up aggressive relationships. Physical fights between queens in the same colony are rare.|$|E
5|$|Spotnitz {{found that}} the main problem with {{developing}} the episode was segueing from a movie that some—but not necessarily all—viewers had seen. The writers sought to bring back characters like Gibson Praise, Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender who {{were not in the}} movie. In addition, the writers also wanted to bring back elements that were also seen in the movie, like the alien. Carter claims to have been thinking about what the episode would entail almost two years prior, when he was working on developing The X-Files movie. The character Sandy, who is killed in the teaser sequence, was played by the show's casting director Rick Millikan on the request of Carter. Millikan later joked that he spent most of the shoot on his cell phone casting other individuals for other X-Files episodes. One of the nuclear power plant <b>workers</b> <b>is</b> named Homer, a reference to Homer Simpson, one of the main characters from the animated Fox television series The Simpsons.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{movement}} of <b>workers</b> <b>is</b> associated with temperature, and foraging workers leave the nest after sunrise when the nest is warmed in the early morning. Meat ants emerge and start foraging when temperatures are approximately 14°C (57°F), but {{they are capable of}} withstanding extremely hot temperatures, as workers have been seen foraging in 43°C (109°F) heat. Workers may only forage for several minutes when soil temperature is well above their thermal limit at 45.8°C (114°F). At 50°C (122°F) (soil surface temperature), foraging activity is reduced even further. As these ants exhibit high running speeds during hot days, their speed decreases after temperatures of 50°C due to the physiological stress put onto them. Workers can withstand such temperatures by exhibiting opportunistic thermal responses to adjust their behaviour in order to handle high trail temperatures and alter their thermal biology for low temperatures. They will also deliberately expose themselves closely to their thermal maxima.|$|E
