25|$|The {{story of}} Pocahontas (Matoaka) tells {{a piece of}} Pamunkey history, but from an English perspective. Study of primary {{documents}} {{from the time of}} English arrival show that initial contact was characterized by mutual cultural misunderstanding. Colonists portrayed the Virginia tribes by contrasts. They had respect for Powhatan, but characterized other Native Americans by terms such as “naked devils”, showing fear. Fear and appreciation of Native Americans was coupled with distrust and uneasiness. George Percy’s account of the early years expresses such duality: “It pleased God, after a while, to send those people which were our mortal enemies to relieve us with victuals, as bread, corn fish, and flesh in great plenty, which was the setting up of our feeble men, otherwise <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> perished”.|$|E

[...] Arians called Mitchell [...] "a super football coach and a great person", adding [...] "I think we had more quarterback sacks this year in our third game than <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> last year." [...] At Temple, Mitchell coached Ralph Jarvis whom the Chicago Bears chose {{in the third round}} of the 1988 NFL Draft.|$|E

500|$|With a {{new name}} and label, the band {{released}} its second album, New American Gospel, in September 2000. Patrick Kennedy of Allmusic compared the band to Pantera stating, [...] "The essential signatures of post-Pantera metal are in abundance on Lamb of God's inaugural album. New American Gospel provides a mighty oak upon which gritty American metal's faith is maintained, effectively bridging the '90s' insistence upon drill-sergeant technicality and the old school's determined focus on riff construction." [...] Chris Adler commented: [...] "This is a classic record. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> the elements come together to make one of the heaviest, yet contagious records of our career. It was difficult to contain us—we didn't even understand at the time what we had created." ...|$|E

[...] "I wasn't embarrassed because we all learned something from it. If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> our players maybe {{it would have been}} only five or six goals, because I was without my best defenders and there was nothing I could do." [...] Tony Langkilde also defended the goalkeeper, saying that he [...] "kept the score down with a magnificent display". He also added that [...] "now we are recognised by FIFA, it has really helped spark an interest in football on the islands". Samoan manager Tunoa Lui commented that football was being played in the Samoan elementary and high schools and [...] "in five years we will be competitive." ...|$|E
500|$|Icewind Dale IIs {{reception}} {{was generally}} positive. Game Informer hailed it as, [...] "one {{of the best}} RPGs ever released for the PC," [...] and GameSpot called it, [...] "simply a great role-playing game." [...] However, PC Format said, [...] "it's uninspired and uninspiring, giving itself a narrow remit and fulfilling that unspectacularly." [...] Certain reviewers compared Icewind Dale II to Neverwinter Nights. IGN said, [...] " [...] the pace of IWD2 is more varied, its balance better, the gameplay more interesting," [...] and Game Informer considered the interface superior to that of Neverwinter Nights. PC Format said, [...] "in the light of Neverwinter Nights in particular, there’s little that stands out in Icewind Dale II to recommend it," [...] and PC Zone said, [...] "it's not the BG2 killer <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> hoped for and neither does it stack up to Neverwinter Nights." ...|$|E

500|$|Since I Left You was {{originally}} developed to be a concept album. Chater described its initial theme as a love story, [...] "an international search for love {{from country to}} country. The idea of a guy following a girl {{around the world and}} always being one port behind. And that was just because <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> these records from all over the world, and we'd like to use all that stuff." [...] The concept album idea was abandoned when the group felt they should not make their themes too obvious. The album's sound was in response to dance music at that time, that Chater felt was [...] "about big drums, big production: think of a record like the Chemical Brothers [...] "Block Rockin' Beats", with those amazing drums, and how huge those records sounded". The Avalanches felt their early music could not compare to that sound and desired a recording with less bass that was influenced by 1960s music such as the Beach Boys and Phil Spector.|$|E
500|$|Broderick's moves were choreographed by Kenny Ortega (who later choreographed Dirty Dancing). Much {{of it had}} to be {{scrapped}} {{though as}} Broderick had injured his knee badly during the scenes of running through neighbors' backyards. [...] "I was pretty sore", Broderick said. [...] "I got well enough to do {{what you see in the}} parade there, but I couldn't do most of Kenny Ortega's knee spins and things like that that we had worked on. When we did shoot it, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> this choreography and I remember John would yell with a megaphone, 'Okay, do it again, but don't do any of the choreography,' because he wanted it to be a total mess." [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] was somewhat choreographed but for [...] "Twist and Shout", Broderick said, [...] "we were just making everything up". Hughes explained that much of the scene was spontaneously filmed. [...] "It just happened that this was an actual parade, which we put our float into—unbeknownst to anybody, all the people on the reviewing stand. Nobody knew what it was, including the governor." ...|$|E
500|$|The rivalry, {{which is}} the oldest in the sport, is fueled by history, competitiveness, and {{cultural}} implication. Both schools {{are located in the}} state of Maryland, a historical hotbed for lacrosse, and have traditionally been two of the sport's powerhouses. Many of the opposing players have had past associations in grade school, high school, or youth club sports. Hopkins' current coach and former player Dave Pietramala said, [...] "Everybody knew each other; <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> played together at some point or another. It was a fierce, intense game and there was no love lost on the field." [...] Additionally, Johns Hopkins is a private university, while Maryland is a public institution. Former Terrapins coach Dick Edell said:"To get the juices flowing before the game, [...] kids that it was the blue-collar guys against the future executives—that this was their only chance to get them before they got into the real world. Plus, you have all the kids who came from the same high school, or worked the camps together, so there was that closeness that you have to live with for the other 364 days, no matter who wins." ...|$|E

500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that accused the character's bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, stated {{in an interview}} with Eurogamer, [...] "People were saying people were dead from the neck down. That's because <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> this animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. Once you get to the level that people can actually see that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of the}} body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games." [...] In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. [...] "It's funny. A lot of people say Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the questions you asked were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way we recorded it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone always says Aaron on the second question is a psycho. So that's not his fault." ...|$|E

2500|$|Te Ngutu o Te Manu was a {{shattering}} {{defeat for}} the Europeans, {{on a similar}} magnitude to the Battle of Puketakuere during the First Taranaki War. Contemporary writers described the loss as [...] "the most serious and complete defeat ever experienced by the colonial forces" [...] and [...] "the most disastrous affair that ever took place in New Zealand". Von Tempsky's death {{came as a shock}} to his military followers and to his wider audience of admirers throughout New Zealand. In the minds of the Pākeha public, von Tempsky was a dashing hero of the New Zealand wars, whose fearlessness and ability to survive near-misses gave him an aura of invincibility.

2500|$|In 2003, the Redskins started 2–0 but {{finished}} 5–11, {{with several}} close losses {{coming down to}} the 4th quarter. The offense was a bit improved, but the departure of defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis to become the {{head coach of the}} Cincinnati Bengals saw the defense fade from 5th in scoring defense during the previous season to 24th in 2003. The team as a whole faded late in the season, and were outscored 85–31 over their last three games. Spurrier resigned on December 30, 2003, choosing to walk away from $15 million still owed to him over the remaining three years of his contract. In a statement released by the team, Spurrier said [...] "I apologize to Redskins fans that we did not reach a level of success that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> hoped...

According to Hardman, [...] "We knew {{that we could not}} raise enough money to shoot a film {{on a par with the}} classic horror films with which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> grown up. The best that we could do was to place our cast in a remote spot and then bring the horror to be visited on them in that spot". Scenes were filmed near Evans City, Pennsylvania, [...] north of Pittsburgh in rural Butler County; the opening sequence was shot at the Evans City Cemetery on Franklin Road, south of the borough. The interior upstairs scenes were filmed in a downtown Evans City home that later became the offices of a prominent local physician and family doctor (Allsop). This home is still standing on South Washington St. (locally called Mars-Evans City Road), between the intersecting streets of South Jackson and Van Buren. The cemetery chapel was under warrant for demolition; however, Gary R. Steiner led a successful effort to raise $50,000 to restore the building, and the chapel is currently undergoing renovations.|$|E
2500|$|The writers {{aimed to}} create stories that they {{describe}} as [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "funny". The writers, including George Maestri and Martin Olson, often presented ideas to Murray while eating hamburgers at Rocky's, a restaurant formerly located on Lankershim in the North Hollywood {{section of the}} San Fernando Valley. He took his team members on [...] "writing trips" [...] to places such as Rocky's, the La Brea Tar Pits, and the wilderness. If he liked the story premises, the writers produced full outlines from the premises. Outlines approved by both him and Nickelodeon became Rocko's Modern Life episodes. Maestri describes some stories as originating from [...] "real life" [...] and some originating from [...] "thin air". Murray stated that each episode of Rocko's Modern Life stemmed from the personal experiences of himself and/or {{one or more of}} the directors or writers. He said that he did not intend to use formulaic writing seen in other cartoons; he desired content that [...] "broke new ground" [...] and [...] "did things that rode the edge", and that could be described as [...] "unexpected". He did not hire writers who had previous experience with writing cartoons, instead hiring writers who worked outside of animation, including improv actors and comic artists. He said that story concepts that [...] "ever smacked close to some formula idea that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> seen before" [...] received immediate rejection.|$|E
2500|$|The Sunday Age on 15 November {{questioned}} {{the timing of}} the original press release about Sarbi's rediscovery, claiming that it had been deliberately held back to coincide with Prime Minister Rudd's visit to Afghanistan so as {{to be able to give}} the story to accompanying reporters. This was based on the fact that Sarbi had been in the hands of Australian forces by at least 28 October based on ADF photos posted on their website on the day of Brigadier Dawson's news conference, and not the week of 1–7 November as released. They further pointed out that questions over {{the timing of the}} release by a reporter at the Brigadier's press conference were not corrected by him. An ADF spokesperson denied any link to the visit, stating the delay in releasing the news was due to [...] "the need to confirm Sarbi's identity, physical condition and quarantine requirements for her return to Australia", details of which would be required by the media, that the reference to [...] "last week" [...] was correct at the time of the release's first draft and unfortunately not been subsequently updated before release, and that [...] "Brigadier Dawson was not aware of the exact date of Sarbi's return and was therefore not in a position to be specific about it." [...] Brigadier Dawson had at the time insisted that the timing of the announcement coinciding with Rudd's visit had been [...] "pure serendipity", and said [...] "We needed to make sure that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> our facts straight...(so) it's really just an accident".|$|E
