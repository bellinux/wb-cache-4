500|$|Though hip-hop {{dancing is}} {{established}} on film and on television, {{it has not}} gained {{the same level of}} exposure in theater. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the dance is performed more in film and in television than it is in a theatrical setting. B-boy and popper Stefan [...] "Mr. Wiggles" [...] Clemente and hip-hop historian Jorge [...] "Popmaster Fabel" [...] Pabon were involved in hip-hop theater at its inception. Their dance company, GhettOriginal, produced the first hip-hop stage shows: 1991's off Broadway musical So! <b>What</b> <b>Happens</b> <b>Now?</b> and 1995's Jam on the Groove. Both shows were performed by the Rock Steady Crew, Magnificent Force, and the Rhythm Technicians. Aside from the pioneers in New York City was Rennie Harris' Puremovement hip-hop theater company. Harris founded Puremovement in 1992 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. One of Puremovement's theater shows Rome & Jewels won two Black Theater Alliance Awards and three Bessie Awards. In 2012, Harris and his company toured Egypt, Israel, and the Palestinian territories as part of Dance Motion USA, a program sponsored by the US State Department to showcase American dance to other countries and promote cultural exchange.|$|E

Bands such as The Sunshine Underground, Cansei de Ser Sexy and Hot Chip are often labeled as new rave due to their large following by fans of the genre. M.I.A. has been described as [...] "a new raver before it was old." [...] Several have publicly declared they {{had nothing to do with}} the genre. Stylist Carri Mundane described it as funny, saying New Rave was [...] "Vacant in retro. It’s just a marketing machine.... I guess it was a fun time but I’m more excited about <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>now.</b> The next level - the next generation. There’s a mood of neo-spiritualism and futurism that excites me." ...|$|E

Video game designer and blogger Damion Schubert wrote he [...] "found Taki’s outfit awesome in Soul Caliber 2, and awful in Soul Caliber 4." [...] According to Kotaku's McWhertor, Taki's [...] "tighter than skin tight ninja outfit leav absolutely nothing to the imagination, making her high kicks the stuff of Hustler magazine spreads." [...] Destructoid's Karim Kayka commented on [...] "ridiculously endowed ninja gal Taki, who demonstrates <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>now</b> that consoles can chum out superflucous polygons to render realistic nipples under a skintight leotard." [...] Shawn Sines of GameFront used the images of Taki from Soulcalibur II and Kasumi from the Dead or Alive series to illustrate the 2007 critical article about [...] "the video game implementation of modeling female breasts." [...] GamesRadar UK opined that in Soulcalibur IV Taki’s breasts look if they [...] "have been designed by a hormone-addled 13-year-old. They’re simply unfathomable and totally impractical for the fighting physique. If she gets punched in them it’s going to hurt and she isn’t even wearing a sports bra." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{assumption}} that sensible objects persist {{after they have}} ceased to be sensible--for example, that the hardness of a visible body, which has been discovered by touch, continues when the body is no longer touched--may {{be replaced by the}} statement that the effects of sensible objects persist, i.e. that <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>now</b> can only be accounted for, in many cases, by taking account of what happened at an earlier time. Everything that one man, by his own personal experience, can verify in the account of the world given by common sense and physics, will be explicable by some such means, since verification consists merely in the occurrence of an expected sense-datum. But what depends upon testimony, whether heard or read, cannot be explained in this way, since testimony depends upon the existence of minds other than our own, and thus requires a knowledge of something not given in sense. But before examining the question of our knowledge of other minds, let us return {{to the question of the}} thing-in-itself, namely, to the theory that what exists at times when we are not perceiving a given sensible object is something quite unlike that object, something which, together with us and our sense-organs, causes our sensations, but is never itself given in sensation.|$|E
