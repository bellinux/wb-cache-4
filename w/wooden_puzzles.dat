50|$|The large {{influx of}} non-English {{speaking}} immigrants into the US {{brought about a}} change in psychological testing that relied heavily on verbal skills for subjects that were not literate in English, or had speech/hearing difficulties. In 1913, R.H. Sylvester standardized the first non-verbal psychological test. In this particular test, participants fit different shaped blocks into their respective slots on a Seguin form board. From this test, Knox developed a series of non-verbal psychological tests that he used while working at the Ellis Island immigrant station in 1914.

40|$|In {{training}} assembly {{workers in}} a factory, there are often barriers such as cost and lost productivity due to shutdown. The use of virtual reality (VR) training {{has the potential to}} reduce these costs. This research compares virtual bimanual haptic training versus traditional physical training and the effectiveness for learning transfer. In a mixed experimental design, participants were assigned to either virtual or physical training and trained by assembling a <b>wooden</b> burr <b>puzzle</b> as many times as possible during a twenty minute time period. After training, participants were tested using the physical puzzle and were retested again after two weeks. All participants were trained using brightly colored puzzle pieces. To examine the effect of color, testing involved the assembly of colored physical parts and natural wood colored physical pieces. Spatial ability as measured using a mental rotation test, was shown to correlate with the number of assemblies they were able to complete in the training. While physical training outperformed virtual training, after two weeks the virtually trained participants actually improved their test assembly times. The results suggest that the color of the puzzle pieces helped the virtually trained participants in remembering the assembly process...|$|R

40|$|We propose here {{a working}} unit for {{teaching}} basic concepts of structural bioinformatics and evolution through {{the example of}} a <b>wooden</b> snake <b>puzzle,</b> strikingly similar to toy models widely used in the literature of protein folding. In our experience, developed at a Master’s course at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (Spain), the concreteness of this example helps to overcome difficulties caused by the interdisciplinary nature of this field and its high level of abstraction, in particular for students coming from traditional disciplines. The puzzle will allow us discussing a simple algorithm for finding folded solutions, through which we will introduce the concept of the configuration space and the contact matrix representation. This is a central tool for comparing protein structures, for studying simple models of protein energetics, and even for a qualitative discussion of folding kinetics, through the concept of the Contact Order. It also allows a simple representation of misfolded conformations and their free energy. These concepts will motivate evolutionary questions, which we will address by simulating a structurally constrained model of protein evolution, again modelled on the snake puzzle. In this way, we can discuss the analogy between evolutionary concepts and statistical mechanics that facilitates the understanding of both concepts. The proposed examples and literature are accessible, and we provide supplementary material (see ‘Data Availability’) to reproduce the numerical experiments. We also suggest possible directions to expand the unit. We hope that this work will further stimulate the adoption of games in teaching practice...|$|R
40|$|Balanced {{information}} and education are fundamental prerequisites for risk prevention and preparedness. Among others, children embody our {{best chance to}} implant appropriate behaviors that will be recalled during hazardous situations and to involve adults according to a knowledge chain reaction. In this work, scientists challenge their communication skills to built a set of hands-on and learn-by-play based laboratory activities, for primary and secondary schools, addressing three major issues: (1) the location of earthquakes and volcanoes on Earth; (2) earthquakes and eruptions mechanisms; (3) earthquakes unpredictability. Students are asked to place volcanoes and earthquakes epicenters (issue 1) on a <b>wooden</b> plate <b>puzzle</b> according to Plate dynamics. To addresses eruption mechanisms (issue 2) and related hazard, we use backing soda forced blowing out from a volcano vent and suggest that a pyroclastic flow is fast, it can spread over a large area and raise high up to the stratosphere. Earthquake mechanisms (issue 2) are discussed describing the energy buildup, release, and transfer, using a wooden sticks bendand- break analogy. The display of acoustic waves caused by the breakage in different situations allows understanding of both the rupture energy and the wave attenuation. Earthquakes occurrence (issue 3) is addressed using steadily pulled blocks sliding on a frictional surface, where pins simulate asperities. These activities were tested, involving thousands of students.

40|$|The {{scientific}} and industrial communities have begun investigating {{the possibility of}} making product recovery economically viable. Disassembly sequence planning {{may be used to}} make end-of-life product take-back processes more cost effective. Much of the research involving disassembly sequence planning relies on mathematical optimization models. These models often require input data that is unavailable or can only be approximated with high uncertainty. In addition, there are few mathematical models that include consideration of the potential of product damage during disassembly operations. The emergence of Immersive Computing Technologies (ICT) enables designers to evaluate products without the need for physical prototypes. Utilizing unique 3 D user interfaces, designers can investigate a multitude of potential disassembly operations without resorting to disassembly of actual products. The information obtained through immersive simulation can be used to determine the optimum disassembly sequence. The aim of this work is to apply a decision analytical approach in combination with immersive computing technology to optimize the disassembly sequence while considering trade-offs between two conflicting attributes: disassembly cost and damage estimation during disassembly operations. A <b>wooden</b> Burr <b>puzzle</b> is used as an example product test case. Immersive human computer interaction is used to determine input values for key variables in the mathematical model. The results demonstrate that the use of dynamic programming algorithms coupled with virtual disassembly simulation is an effective method for evaluating multiple attributes in disassembly sequence planning. This paper presents a decision analytical approach, combined with immersive computing techniques, to optimize the disassembly sequence. Future work will concentrate on creating better methods of estimating damage in virtual disassembly environments and using the immersive technology to further explore the feasible design space...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigated whether {{different forms}} of praise could affect the latency of help-seeking in young children. Two forms of praise were investigated: person- praise and process-praise. Previous research found that process-praise led to greater task persistence than person -praise. In experiment 1, four-year-old children were asked to solve a series of <b>wooden</b> jigsaw <b>puzzles.</b> The children received either person-praise or process-praise upon solving the first four puzzles. The children were then provided with incorrect, yet highly similar puzzle pieces for two subsequent puzzles to create experiences of failure. Results replicated previous task persistence findings, however no effect on help-seeking was found. It was postulated that the obviousness of providing incorrect puzzle pieces created inauthentic failure experiences. Experiment 2 sought to tease apart the results from experiment 1 by using stimuli that created genuine failure experiences. Results revealed that person-praise reduced the latency to seek help compared to process-praise when children experienced genuine failures. In addition, experiment 2 examined the generalization of the task persistence findings by using stimuli that were different from those used when the children were praised. Results revealed {{that the effects of}} praise on task persistence did not transfer to dissimilar tasks. Individual differences were also examined in both studies using parent reported temperament ratings. The temperament domain of effortful control moderated the influence of praise on help-seeking behavior in both studies. Results showed that the type of stimuli used influenced the interactions in different ways. These findings were the first to suggest that praise could influence help-seeking behavior in young children, but only after experiencing genuine failures. We discussed possible implications this finding has on the interpretation of previous research and proposed future studies to further examine the possible influences of praise on young children's adaptive learning strategie...|$|R
