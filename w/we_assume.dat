25|$|If <b>we</b> <b>assume</b> the {{validity}} of Kepler's laws, then the obvious way to resolve this discrepancy is {{to conclude that the}} mass distribution in spiral galaxies is not {{similar to that of the}} solar system.

25|$|In {{this section}} <b>we</b> <b>assume</b> that the vector space V is finite-dimensional {{and that the}} {{bilinear}} form of Q is non-singular. A central simple algebra over K is a matrix algebra over a (finite-dimensional) division algebra with center K.

25|$|Through its {{slope and}} y-intercept we can obtain vmon and K, which are {{constants}} for each adsorbent/adsorbate pair {{at a given}} temperature. vmon {{is related to the}} number of adsorption sites through the ideal gas law.

25|$|The {{changes of}} state of the system are called transitions. The probabilities {{associated}} with various state changes are called transition probabilities.

For the neonate simulation, <b>we</b> <b>assumed</b> that a normal VD-E[*]=[*] 2.5  mL/kg [33], for RDS VD-E[*]=[*] 3.8  mL/kg [33], and for chronic lung disease (CLD) VD-E[*]=[*] 3.8  mL/kg [33].|$|R
25|$|For example, {{consider}} the deterministic sorting algorithm quicksort. This solves {{the problem of}} sorting a list of integers that is given as the input. The worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order, and the algorithm takes time O(n2) for this case. If <b>we</b> <b>assume</b> that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely, the average time taken for sorting is O(n log n). The best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half, also needing O(n log n) time.|$|E
25|$|Kempe's {{argument}} goes as follows. First, if planar regions separated by the graph are not triangulated, i.e. {{do not have}} exactly three edges in their boundaries, we can add edges without introducing new vertices {{in order to make}} every region triangular, including the unbounded outer region. If this triangulated graph is colorable using four colors or fewer, so is the original graph since the same coloring is valid if edges are removed. So it suffices to prove the four color theorem for triangulated graphs to prove it for all planar graphs, and without loss of generality <b>we</b> <b>assume</b> the graph is triangulated.|$|E
