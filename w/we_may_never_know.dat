Clubs Clayton Purdom, dril is a sort of patron saint of Internet users, or [...] "your uncle's search history come to life and filtered through a scabrous comic sensibility, and ... possibly the most popular, beloved man on the entire internet (after, maybe, The Rock)." [...] Will Shaw of The Oxford Student noted the familiarity of dril's [...] "naive appeals to moderation" [...] and [...] "flame war posturing," [...] and said dril [...] "is the internet's collective id, given form. He's the internet equivalent of the Beowulf-poet; <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> who he really is, but we recognise when he is being channelled." [...] Christine Erickson at Mashable said dril's character was like [...] "a spambot equivalent to the kind of crazy that Clint Eastwood portrays." [...] At Kotaku, Gita Jackson called dril a [...] "joke account that also inadvertently catalogues ... every way to be mad online." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{employment}} of the disenfranchised female as visual icon within {{the art world}} {{is a fact that}} feminist critics have diagnosed, as the avant-garde's testing of cultural limits, where the female body, as symptomatic of a visual regime where [...] "Woman" [...] serves as [...] "the very ground of representation, both object and support of a desire which, intimately bound up with power and creativity, is the moving force of culture and history." [...] The ability of male artists to form new expressive modes of representation filled with dynamic power is not a new concept within art history; Duncan in particular emphasizes and exposes the relationship between art historians and the avant-garde painters of the post modern era in that art historians emphasize the notion: “that avant-garde art consists of so many movements of individual artistic freedom, a freedom evidenced in the artist’s capacity for innovation” and in this freedom both artist and historian are freed to analyze and construct work in a larger structure without recognizing the social constraints and responsibilities of the past and their impact on contemporary society. Duncan questions where does this innovation arise? Is it completely unmotivated? A gift from God? <b>We</b> <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>know.</b> Picasso in discussing the work was often resistant to acknowledge any guidance in context; favouring instead to address it in a way which ranged from vague, humorous and sarcastic. For example, when “speaking to Kahnweiler in December 1933, Picasso recalled the jokes he and his friends bandied about the women in the Demoiselles painting, identifying one of them as Picasso's girlfriend, Fernande, another as Marie Laurencin, a third as the grandmother of his poet friend Max Jacob-"all in a brothel in Avignon!” ...|$|E

Ah! reader, poor human beings have many and many a time in the past been brought to this terrible condition.

He did believe in {{what he called a}} fresh eye, and he did want scope for fresh methods. There was something in his view, but it failed where such things commonly fail, because the fresh eye cannot see the unseen. It is true about the ladder and the scarecrow, but not about the life and the soul; and he made a bad mistake about what a man like Michael would do when he heard a woman scream. All Michael's very vanity and vainglory made him rush out at once; he would have walked into Dublin Castle for a lady's glove. Call it his pose or what you will, but he would have done it. What happened when he met her is another story, and one <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>know,</b> but from tales I've heard since, they must have been reconciled. Wilson was wrong there; but there was something, for all that, in his notion that the newcomer sees most, and that the man on the spot may know too much to know anything. He was right about some things. He was right about me." ...|$|E
60|$|The puzzle in {{the case}} of Escovedo does not concern the manner of his taking off, or the {{identity}} of his murderers. These things are perfectly well known; the names of the guilty, from the King to the bravo, are ascertained. The mystery clouds the motives for the deed. Why was Escovedo done to death? Did the King have him assassinated for purely political reasons, really inadequate, but magnified by the suspicious royal fancy? Or were the secretary of Philip II. and the monarch of Spain rivals in the affections of a one-eyed widow of rank? and did the secretary, Perez, induce Philip to give orders for Escovedo's death, because Escovedo threatened to reveal to the King their guilty intrigue? Sir William Stirling-Maxwell and Monsieur Mignet accepted, with shades of difference, this explanation. Mr. Froude, on the other hand, held that Philip acted for political reasons, and with the full approval of his very ill-informed conscience. There was no lady as a motive {{in the case}}, in Mr. Froude's opinion. A third solution is possible: Philip, perhaps, wished to murder Escovedo for political reasons, and without reference to the tender passion; but Philip was slow and irresolute, while Perez, who dreaded Escovedo's interference with his love affair, urged his royal master on to the crime which he was shirking. <b>We</b> <b>may</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> the exact truth, but at least we can study a state of morals and manners at Madrid, compared with which the blundering tragedies of Holyrood, in Queen Mary's time, seem mere child's play.
