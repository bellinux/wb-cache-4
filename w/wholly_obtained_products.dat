In pregnancy, iodide losses through the urine and the feto-placental unit contribute to a state of relative iodine deficiency. Thus, pregnant women require additional iodine intake. A daily iodine intake of 250 µg is recommended in pregnancy but this is not always achieved even in iodine sufficient parts of the world.|$|R

40|$|From neutral {{trade policy}} devices {{employed}} to identity {{country of origin}} of commodities, the rules of origin are emerging as protectionist tools. Nation-states, as they are increasingly denied of conventional trade policy tools, are reasserting themselves by evolving new and less visible weapons of intervention. The misuse of rules of origin as protectionist tools is widely reported from PTAs among developed countries, such as EEC and NAFTA. More recently, non-preferential rules of origin are also being used for protectionist purpose.
