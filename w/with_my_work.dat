500|$|On 15 September Cros {{received}} {{temporary promotion}} to colonel and on 20 October was given {{command of the}} 2nd Moroccan Brigade at the Battle of the Yser. [...] His promotion was confirmed as permanent on 1 November 1914 and he became a commander of the Legion of Honour on 10 April 1915. [...] He also received a further mention in dispatches as [...] "a brave soldier, an experienced great leader, wise, prudent, with natural authority" [...] and was awarded the Croix de Guerre with palm. [...] In the spring he wrote to an archaeological colleague, Léon Heuzey, telling him that [...] "I continue <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>work</b> as an archaeologist. [...] As at Tello I record earthworks, but instead of artefacts of Gudea I find German shells, it is not without excitement". [...] Cros was appointed a commander of the Legion of Honour on 10 April 1915.|$|E
500|$|The imposed {{regimen of}} asylum life gave van Gogh a hard-won stability: [...] "I feel happier here <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>work</b> than I could be outside. By staying here {{a good long}} time, I shall have learned regular habits {{and in the long}} run the result will be more order in my life." [...] While his time at Saint-Rémy forced him to manage his vices, such as coffee, alcohol, poor eating habits and {{periodic}} attempts to consume turpentine and paint, his stay was not ideal. [...] He needed to obtain permission to leave the asylum grounds. The food was poor; he generally ate only bread and soup. [...] His only apparent form of treatment were two-hour baths twice a week. During his year there, van Gogh had periodic attacks, possibly due to a form of epilepsy. By early 1890, when the attacks worsened, he concluded that his stay at the asylum was not helping him to recover, which led him to move to Auvers-sur-Oise just north of Paris in May 1890.|$|E
40|$|The {{first three}} {{chapters}} cover {{historical and contemporary}} theories of consonance and dissonance that directly influenced <b>my</b> <b>work.</b> This thesis focuses on music-theory and acoustic interpretations of the two terms, but contains also two non-conform points of view on the subject.

40|$|This {{presentation}} paper aims {{to compare}} and contrast the use of shadowing and understanding of shadows in different art periods and practices. The illusory effects of shadowing and its relations with particular artworks have been questioned. The uses of shadow effect in recent arts are analysed by asserting the approaches taken in recent critical work and compared and contrasted <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>works.</b> Shadow is considered as it moves the borders between actual and virtual {{in the space of}} art...|$|R

Fortunately, my readers, the children (and their parents) do, so as long as they love and read my books, I am happy.
