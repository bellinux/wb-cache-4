5|$|Street {{foods are}} a key element to Faislabadi cuisine. Samosas (deep fried pastry filled <b>with</b> <b>vegetables</b> or meat) topped with an onion salad and two types of chutney. There is even a square {{dedicated}} {{to them in the}} old city. Other street foods include, dahi bhale (deep fried vadas in creamy yoghurt), gol gappay (fried round puri filled <b>with</b> <b>vegetables</b> and topped with tamarind chutney) and vegetable or chicken pakoras. Biryani and murgh pilao rice are a speciality in Faisalabad.|$|E
5|$|For presentation, one {{suggestion}} is that the pilchards be arranged with their tails toward {{the centre of the}} pie and their heads poking up through the crust around the edge. As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its own or with crusty bread, sometimes <b>with</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or a slice of lemon.|$|E
5|$|Chicken is {{the most}} widely eaten meat in Israel, {{followed}} by turkey. Chicken is prepared in a multitude of ways, from simple oven-roasted chicken to elaborate casseroles with rich sauces such as date syrup, tomato sauce, etc. Examples include chicken casserole with couscous, inspired by Moroccan Jewish cooking, chicken with olives, a Mediterranean classic, and chicken albondigas (meat balls) in tomato sauce, from Jerusalem Sephardi cuisine. Albondigas are also prepared from ground meat., similar to albogindas is the more popular Kufta which is made of minced meat, herbs and spices and cooked with tomato sauce, date syrup, pomegranate syrup or tamarind syrup <b>with</b> <b>vegetables</b> or beans.|$|E

5|$|Egyptian cuisine {{remained}} remarkably stable over time; indeed, {{the cuisine}} of modern Egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients. The staple diet consisted {{of bread and}} beer, supplemented <b>with</b> <b>vegetables</b> such as onions and garlic, and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis. Fish, meat, and fowl could be salted or dried, and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.|$|E
5|$|Spain's varied Mediterranean cuisines {{includes}} the cooking of Andalusia, Murcia, Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic islands. Paella is a characteristic Spanish dish, originally from Valencia, radiating {{early on to}} Catalonia and Murcia along Spain's Mediterranean coast. It comes in many versions, and may contain a mixture of chicken, pork, rabbit, or shellfish, sautéed in {{olive oil in a}} large shallow pan, <b>with</b> <b>vegetables,</b> and typically round-grain rice (often of the local albufera, arròs bomba, sénia varieties or similar) cooked to absorb the water and coloured with saffron. The dish may be varied with artichoke hearts, peas, sweet peppers, lima beans, string beans, or sausages.|$|E
5|$|The region spans a {{wide variety}} of {{cultures}} with distinct cuisines, in particular (going anticlockwise around the region) the Maghrebi, Levantine, Ottoman (Turkish), Greek, Italian, Provençal (French), Spanish, and Portuguese. However, the historical connections of the region, as well as the impact of the Mediterranean Sea on the region's climate and economy, mean that these cuisines share dishes beyond the core trio of oil, bread, and wine, such as roast lamb or mutton, meat stews <b>with</b> <b>vegetables</b> and tomato (for example, Spanish andrajos and Italian ciambotta), and the salted cured fish roe, bottarga, found across the region. Spirits based on anise are drunk in many countries around the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|Typical of German {{preparations}} {{is the use}} of a sweet mango sauce {{instead of}} the slightly salty relishes used in Arab countries. In addition, falafel in Berlin is usually served as take-away food, combined <b>with</b> <b>vegetables</b> and different sauces in a pita or döner bread. Restaurants associated with the thriving Jewish and Israeli community in Berlin, including the Kanaan in Prenzlauer Berg (which is based on an Israeli-Palestinian cooperation) tend to serve complete falafel meals, not carry-out.|$|E
5|$|Homer and {{his group}} begin {{guarding}} the museum. Grampa and his friends from the retirement home volunteer to help, but Homer tells them to leave because they are too old. A few minutes later, Homer sees a group of teenagers drinking beer. He leaves his post to intervene and catch them, but immediately ends up getting drunk with them instead. While Homer's guard is down, the cat burglar sneaks past and steals the zirconia. Homer is blamed and pelted <b>with</b> <b>vegetables</b> by the unforgiving townspeople. Later that day, Grampa stops by the Simpsons' house and tells everybody that he knows who the cat burglar is: a resident in the local retirement home named Molloy.|$|E
5|$|Le dîner (dinner) often {{consists}} of three courses, hors d'œuvre or entrée (appetizers or introductory course, sometimes soup), plat principal (main course), and a cheese course or dessert, sometimes with a salad offered before the cheese or dessert. Yogurt may replace the cheese course, while a simple dessert would be fresh fruit. The meal is often accompanied by bread, wine and mineral water. Most {{of the time the}} bread would be a baguette which is very common in France and is made almost every day. Main meat courses are often served <b>with</b> <b>vegetables,</b> along with potatoes, rice or pasta. Restaurants often open at 7:30pm for dinner, and stop taking orders between the hours of 10:00pm and 11:00pm. Some restaurants close for dinner on Sundays.|$|E

5|$|Mason's {{successor}} Horner {{proved to}} be extremely unpopular as governor and his tenure was very short. Residents disliked him so much they burned him in effigy and pelted him <b>with</b> <b>vegetables</b> upon his entry into the territorial capital. In the October 1835 elections, voters approved the draft constitution and elected the popular Mason as state governor. The same election saw Isaac E. Crary chosen as Michigan's first U.S. Representative to Congress. Because of the dispute Congress refused to accept his credentials and seated him as a non-voting delegate. The two U.S. Senators chosen by the state legislature in November, Lucius Lyon and John Norvell, were treated with even less respect, being allowed to sit only as spectators in the Senate gallery.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced <b>with</b> <b>vegetables</b> and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete too much with the flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E
5|$|With common {{ingredients}} including the olive, wheat, and grape; a shared climate; {{and a long}} period for cultural exchange, it might be expected that a single, pan-Mediterranean cuisine would have developed. Certain items, such as olive oil, bread, wine, roast lamb or mutton (for example, Maghreb méchoui, Greek kleftiko and souvlaki, Turkish shish kebab), bottarga, and stews of meat <b>with</b> <b>vegetables</b> and tomato (such as Spanish andrajos, French estouffade à la Provençale, Italian ciambotta, Turkish buğu kebabı), are indeed found all around the Mediterranean. Despite this, however, the lands bordering the Mediterranean sea have distinct regional cuisines, from the Maghreb, Levant and Ottoman to the Italian, French, and Spanish. Each of those, in turn, has national and provincial variations.|$|E

The respondents are vegetable farmers {{who live in the}} sub-district Syiah Kuala of Banda Aceh and sub-district Darussalam of Aceh Besar. Sampling was done by simple random sampling. Data collection was conducted on the 77 respondents using survey, interviews and observations technique, starting in April 2015 The descriptive analysis and correlation test (Pearson correlation) were used to analyze the data. The results showed that the level of agribusines competencies of smallholders <b>with</b> <b>vegetable</b> planting in Banda Aceh and Aceh Besar including moderate category. The moderate agribusiness competence is shown by the moderate level of knowledge, attitude, and skill. There is a very real correlation between: the characteristics of the socio-demographic (age, level of formal education, non-formal education, and experience), motivation to farm, interaction and communication of farmers with agribusiness competencies of smallholders <b>with</b> <b>vegetable</b> planting. The effective strategies that can improve the agribusiness competence of smallhoders are: improve training and field school for farmers, increase the interaction and communication of farmers with extension workers, and the development of farmers groups...|$|R

5|$|The Duke of Wellington {{felt that}} the {{remainder}} of the day's events should be cancelled following the accident at Parkside, and proposed to return to Liverpool. However, a large crowd had gathered in Manchester to see the trains arrive, and was beginning to become unruly. Wellington was persuaded to continue to Manchester. By the time the trains reached the outskirts of Manchester the crowd had become hostile and was spilling onto the tracks. With local authorities unable to clear the tracks, the trains were obliged to drive at low speed into the crowd, using their own momentum to push people out of the way. Eventually they arrived at Liverpool Road railway station in Manchester to be met by a hostile crowd, who waved banners and flags against the Duke and pelted him <b>with</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Wellington refused to get off the train, and ordered that the trains return to Liverpool. Mechanical failures and an inability to turn the locomotives meant that most of the trains were unable to leave Manchester. While the Duke of Wellington's train left successfully, only three of the remaining seven locomotives were usable. These three locomotives slowly hauled a single long train of 24 carriages back to Liverpool, eventually arriving 6 hours late after having been pelted with objects thrown from bridges by the drunken crowds lining the track.|$|E
