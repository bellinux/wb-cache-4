The House of Lords announced that Lord Bridges of Headley would move the bill's second reading for debate on 20 and 21 February, and that the Lord Privy Seal (Baroness Evans of Bowes Park) would move that Standing Orders be dispensed with so as to allow manuscript amendments to be tabled and moved for the third reading. [...] "Within three months of exercising the power under section 1(1), Ministers of the Crown must bring forward proposals to ensure that citizens of another European Union or European Economic Area country and their family members, who are legally resident in the United Kingdom on the day on which this Act is passed, continue to be treated {{in the same way}} <b>with</b> <b>regardsto</b> their EU derived-rights and, in the case of residency, their potential to acquire such rights in the future."

40|$|Material RepresentationsThrough an {{examination}} and critique of western notions of ideology, particularlythose based on Lois Althusser’s account of ideology grounded in imaginaryconditions of existence, my research aimed to propose an alternative way of thinkingabout ideology and ontology. My argument related specifically to {{art and culture}} anddemonstrated through theoretical argument and practice, how Indigenous art andculture allow us to conceive of an alternative understanding of ideology. The purposeis to attempt to overturn the amnesia condition that persists in Australia <b>with</b> <b>regardsto</b> culture. I elaborated an alternative framework of ideology based on Indigenousculture and grounded {{on the relationship between}} culture and Land and posited amaterialist ontology that resolves the opposition between “real” and the “imaginary”as they are understood within an Althussian framework. My argument is underpinnedby the crucial premise that an Indigenous ideology is grounded upon the notion of“Country” (Land) and its inextricable relation to culture...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} this work, we have investigated the statistical data available sofar, analyzing food consumption in terms of quantity and of quality as well. <b>With</b> <b>regardsto</b> quantity, food consumption in Romania is below the E. U. mean for most foodproducts, excepting cereals and potatoes. In terms of quality, the structure of foodconsumption in Romania represents a deficit, because of the low amount of animal-basedcalories. Regarding {{the structure of the}} protein intake, the amount of animal-basedproteins is 20 % smaller than in the E. U. countries. In agriculture, an important role isplayed by self-consumption, but the less developed the agriculture is, the bigger theamount of self-consumption within the total production is, and conversely. The directfamily consumption within the total agricultural production represents a high amount,i. e. : in Romania 58 %; Bulgaria 54 %; Lithuania 46 %, Latvia 45 %; Poland 37 %, thesmallest consumption being present in The Czech Republic – 27 %...|$|E
40|$|The Satisfaction {{with life}} scale (SWLS) {{developed}} by Diener, Emmons, Larsen, and Griffin(1985) {{is considered the}} most widely used psychometric scale for assessing life satisfaction. Despiteplethora of cross-cultural research that provided evidences of its robustness, none was conducted inFrench-speaking sub-Saharan countries such as Togo. Objective. - Accordingly, {{the purpose of the present}} study was to investigate the validity of the SWLS extensively among Togolese college students (n = 460) in a three-step approach from 2012 to 2014. Method and results. - Firstly, social representations of well-being were explored qualitatively. Then, theoriginal version of the SWLS was administered. Based on the results we gathered, a scale item was altered. Psychometric properties of the revised version of the SWLS were examined, revealing adequate constructvalidity, reliability, temporal stability, measurement invariance across gender, convergent validity witha single measure of life satisfaction, and discriminant validity with various life domain satisfactions. Conclusion. - Limitations and implications in life satisfaction measurement are also discussed <b>with</b> <b>regardsto</b> the Togolese cultural context...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{get more}} results or greater accuracy, {{computational}} scientists execute their applications on distributedcomputing platforms such as clusters, grids, and clouds. These platforms {{are different in}} terms of hardwareand software resources as well as locality: some span across multiple sites and multiple administrativedomains, whereas others are limited to a single site/domain. As a consequence, in order to scale theirapplications up, the scientists have to manage technical details for each target platform. From our pointof view, this complexity should be hidden from the scientists, who, in most cases, would prefer to focuson their research rather than spending time dealing with platform configuration concerns. In this article, we advocate for a system management framework that aims to automatically set upthe whole run-time environment according to the applications’ needs. The main difference <b>with</b> <b>regardsto</b> usual approaches is that they generally only focus on the software layer whereas we address both thehardware and the software expectations through a unique system. For each application, scientists describetheir requirements through {{the definition of a}} virtual platform (VP) and a virtual system environment (VSE). Relying on the VP/VSE definitions, the framework is in charge of (i) the configuration of the physicalinfrastructure to satisfy the VP requirements, (ii) the set-up of the VP, and (iii) the customization of theexecution environment (VSE) upon the former VP. We propose a new formalism that the system can relyupon to successfully perform each of these three steps without burdening the user with the specifics ofthe configuration for the physical resources, and system management tools. This formalism leveragesGoldberg’s theory for recursive virtual machines (Goldberg, 1973 [6]) by introducing new conceptsbased on system virtualization (identity, partitioning, aggregation) and emulation (simple, abstraction). This enables the definition of complex VP/VSE configurations without making assumptions about thehardware and the software resources. For each requirement, the system executes the correspondingoperation with the appropriate management tool. As a proof of concept, we implemented a first prototype that currently interacts with several systemmanagement tools (e. g., OSCAR, the Grid’ 5000 toolkit, and XtreemOS) and that can be easily extended tointegrate new resource brokers or cloud systems such as Nimbus, OpenNebula, or Eucalyptus, for instance...|$|E
