500|$|... "Vanilla Chocolat" [...] {{was written}} by Stan, Sava Constantin, Alexandru Cotoi, Stefan Mihalache and Mika Moupondo, while {{production}} was handled by Cotoi. The track was recorded at Fonogram Studios in Bucharest, Romania, and features lyrics written in both English and French. [...] "Vanilla Chocolat" [...] was composed during the song-writing Fonocamp-camp in Azuga, Romania, where the singer worked on new songs along with fellow Romanian and international artists. Particularly, Stan {{felt that she was}} very [...] "pleased with the collaboration, because [...] really wanted to work with Romanian artists, not just with Romanian producers like on [...] second studio album." [...] She talked about the choosing of Connect-R as the guest vocalist for [...] "Vanilla Chocolat":"I chose Connect-R because it seems that he can [...] "deal" [...] with every music genre, because he is flexible and he can continue even with every unexpected change or sound combination. Connect-R can also sing in every language without any problems, because he believes in his own work. <b>We</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> the Fonogram Studios, and we started 'half seriously and jokingly' to work on the song, along with Alex Cotoi. The result is 'sweet and fragrant'.|$|E
500|$|After the song's release, critics heavily {{compared}} its {{lyrics to}} Eminem, and suggested Carey alluded {{to him and}} his 'obsession' with her. [...] "Obsessed" [...] never mentions the rapper's name, although reviewers felt it to be very obvious. The song begins with [...] "I was like, 'Why are you so obsessed with me?'", before the music begins. This line references the 2004 film Mean Girls. As the first verse begins, Carey describes the tracks' subjects constant lies: [...] "All up in the blogs sayin' <b>we</b> <b>met</b> <b>at</b> a bar / When I don't even, know who you are / Sayin' you up in my house sayin' you up in my car / When you in L.A. and I'm at Jermaine's". Additionally, the song suggests the stalker is under the influence of drugs: It must be the weed, it must be the E / 'Cause you be poppin', heard you get it poppin'." [...] During the chorus, Carey confronts her stalker, asking: Why are you so obsessed with me / Boy I wanna know / Lying that you're sexing me / When everybody knows/ It's clear that you're upset with me / Oh, Oh, Oh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress / last man on the earth still couldn't get this." [...] During the song's second verse, critics complimented Carey's lyrics, highlighting phrases such as: You're a mom & pop, I'm a corporation / I'm the press conference, you're a conversation", [...] "suggesting the rapper isn't a worthy suitor".|$|E
