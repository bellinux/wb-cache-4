5|$|Åkerman played Silk Spectre II in the 2009 superhero film Watchmen, a {{role for}} which she was {{nominated}} for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. The same year, she had supporting and starring roles in both The Proposal and Couples Retreat, two commercial hits that garnered mixed to negative reviews. In 2010, she became part of the main cast on the comedy series Childrens Hospital. She starred in four feature films in 2012, including the comedy <b>Wanderlust</b> and the musical film Rock of Ages.

5|$|Marquis {{was born}} in Missouri and trained for {{a career as a}} printworker. He moved to Montana because he wanted an {{adventure}} in the West, but ended up staying there for the remainder of his life. At first he worked as an itinerant printer, but after getting married he trained in medicine and became a physician. The idea was to have a more settled lifestyle, especially after his first daughter was born, but Marquis seemed to have a <b>wanderlust,</b> frequently changing location and often considering a change of career (he qualified as an attorney at one point). This became especially apparent after his military service in World War I and the failure of his marriage. These moves were always within Montana, and his final location was in Hardin on the Crow Reservation close to the Custer battle site. He founded a museum there that has now been incorporated into the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument.|$|E

5000|$|As Miller {{described}} [...] "Genetic," [...] "It {{opens with}} a pulsating analog synth melody and ascendant vocals that sound like the closing hymn from a much distant church—resounding, rejoicing and mourning all at once—before McGuire's slippery, Gottsching-indebted guitar anchors its psychedelic swirl. And yet, even as it pushes into the dense <b>wanderlusts</b> of their past, there's a distinct concern for melody." ...|$|R
25|$|Aniston {{appeared}} in the comedy <b>Wanderlust</b> (2012) with Paul Rudd, with whom she co-starred in the movie The Object of My Affection (1998) and also Friends. The script for <b>Wanderlust,</b> bought by Universal Pictures, was written by Rudd, Ken Marino, and David Wain, with the latter also directing the film, and was produced by Judd Apatow. The movie was about a married couple who join a commune after losing their money and deciding modern life is not for them. <b>Wanderlust</b> received positive reviews but was a box office failure, grossing only $21 million worldwide, against a production budget of $35 million.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Wanderlusting,</b> is {{the second}} solo album by Deadbeat Darling {{frontman}} Joseph King. The album was recorded at Bird Creek Studio in Garrison, New York with musical collaborator Drew Nix who is credited as co-producer. For the albums sound, King {{said he wanted to}} get away from the two guitars/drums/bass formula which has defined his past musical projects, and instead pursue a [...] "surfier acoustic pop thing with organs and synth." ...|$|R
50|$|Joseph's album <b>Wanderlusting</b> was {{recorded}} {{during the summer}} of 2013 at Bird Creek Studios in the woods of upstate New York with co-producer, studio owner and long-time friend Drew Nix. Inspired by the solace of the isolated bucolic surroundings, the pair created a collection of songs which act as vignettes into a year in Joseph's life when his former relationship, band and record label all collapsed. The album exudes a sense of celebration, mischief, irreverence and beauty, and has a stripped-down indie rock meets 60's surf sound.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wanderlusts</b> deck logs cease on 30 September 1918 {{when she}} was at Brunswick. The 1918 edition of Ships Data: U.S. Naval Vessels lists her as serving on section patrol duties as of 1 November 1918. In the absence of solid data, it must be assumed that, like many other {{district}} patrol craft, if she was in active service in mid-to-late November 1918, she would have ceased defensive patrolling on 24 November 1918, 13 days after the armistice ended World War I. She may have lain in reserve or performed dispatch services between 30 September 1918, when her deck logs end, and 2 February 1919, the date upon which she was struck from the Navy List.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Woody Guthrie {{was living on}} Mermaid Avenue in Coney Island, New York. [...] Although Bob Dylan made a pilgrimage to visit Guthrie, who was {{physically}} deteriorating due to a neurological disorder called Huntington's Disease, the town of Okemah {{had no interest in}} remembering its native son. Okemah residents regarded Guthrie with some suspicion and some believed he was a Communist based on his [...] "Woody Sez" [...] column published in a Communist paper The People's World. [...] In addition, Guthrie sang out his beliefs at labor union rallies - sometimes with other outspoken artists such as Pete Seeger and Cisco Houston. As late as 1971, the Okemah City Council refused to proclaim Woody Guthrie Day due to his radical politics. By the 1970s, although most young people in Okemah had never heard of Guthrie, Guthrie-followers began making pilgrimages to Okemah to visit the house where Guthrie lived. [...] Guthrie's son Arlo - a well-known folksinger himself by the 70s - also made occasional trips to Okemah [...] "to feel the situation out." [...] However, it wasn't until the late 1990s, when Billy Bragg visited Okemah filming scenes for his Man in the Sand documentary about the making of Mermaid Avenue, a collection of unknown Guthrie lyrics put to Bragg's music in collaboration with Wilco, that the town of Okemah started to embrace its wiry <b>wanderlusting</b> native. [...] Bragg fittingly christened the first festival in 1998. In an article for Dirty Linen Annette C. Eshleman wrote: [...] "Residents' attitudes have gone from angry accusations of Guthrie being a Communist, to suspicious tolerance, to embracing his legion of loyal fans. And while the economic boost that a festival provides to such a small community is certainly welcome, the kindness and hospitality of openhearted locals is genuine." ...|$|R

25|$|Millais {{began his}} career in the army with the Seaforth Highlanders, but after six years he {{resigned}} to travel the world. His was clearly a <b>wanderlust</b> based on a desire to see, record and paint the natural world. To this end he travelled widely in Europe, Africa and North America. In the New World in the 1880s/90s he explored Canada and Newfoundland and helped map uncharted areas of Alaska.|$|E
25|$|Bono {{wrote the}} lyrics {{during his first}} night visiting Côte d’Azur in 1986, while {{struggling}} to reconcile his responsibilities as both a married man and a musician.

While writing the lyrics, he realized that neither facet of his life defined him, but rather {{the tension between the}} two did. He explained that the final lyric is about torment and how repressing desires only makes them stronger.|$|E

The Pittsburgh Pulp defined David Berkeley one of the best examples in the resurgence of folk rock, praising the American taste of his songs along with his melodic and melancholy voice. The already mentioned Rob O'Connor, on Harp Magazine, noticed a superficial resemblance to the quieter side of Eddie Vedder paired with <b>wanderlust</b> and bravado, in the finest troubadour tradition.|$|E
