25|$|The most {{important}} historiographic {{legacy of the}} Jāmiʿ al-Tawārīkh may be its documentation of the cultural mixing and ensuing dynamism {{that led to the}} greatness of the Persian and Ottoman Empires, many aspects of which were transmitted to Europe and influenced the Renaissance. This was the product of the geographical extension of the Mongol Empire, and is most clearly reflected in this work by Rashid al-Din. The text describes the different peoples with whom the Mongols came into contact {{and is one of the}} first attempts to transcend a single cultural perspective and to treat history on a universal scale. The Jāmiʿ attempted to provide a history of the <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> that era, though many parts are sadly lost.|$|E

500|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{eventually}} supplant Christianity with a religion more amenable to National Socialist ideology, Himmler, together with Alfred Rosenberg, sought {{to replace it with}} Germanic paganism (the indigenous traditional religion or Volksreligion of the Germanic peoples), of which the Japanese Shinto was seen as an almost perfect East Asian counterpart. For this purpose they had ordered the construction of sites for the worship of Germanic cults in order to exchange Christian rituals for Germanic consecration ceremonies, which included different marriage and burial rites. In Heinrich Heims' Adolf Hitler, Monologe im FHQ 1941-1944 (several editions, here Orbis Verlag, 2000), Hitler is quoted as having said on 14 October 1941: [...] "It seems to be inexpressibly stupid to allow a revival of the cult of Odin/Wotan. Our old mythology of the gods was defunct, and incapable of revival, when Christianity came...the <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> antiquity either followed philosophical systems on the one hand, or worshipped the gods. But in modern times it is undesirable that all humanity should make such a fool of itself." ...|$|E

After seeing a trailer of Barber's film project, Idlewild, Aguilera {{wanted to make a}} video directed by him, explained: [...] "It intrigued me that this man, Bryan Barber, had been very locked into and had surrounded himself with this <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> the '20s and '30s era, and it made me think that he could understand what I'm trying to do conceptually. I needed to get the right director who shared my vision". At first Aguilera planned to make a black-and-white video and shot it in her living room for Barber and Slaugher. [...] "I had acted out the entire video in my living room. I used my fireplace as a makeshift stage and the staircase as the pool table where I would stand", said Aguilera. According to Barber, Aguilera was very involved in the making of the videot. The whole team seemed like they were doing a movie more than a music video. On June 21, 2006, the music video for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] was premiered on MTV's Total Request Live.|$|E

Immediately {{upon arrival}} in Germany, Brundage became {{headline}} news {{when he and}} the AOC dismissed swimmer Eleanor Holm Jarrett, a gold medalist in 1932 and expected to repeat, for activities on shipboard. Rumors and accounts of the married swimmer's pursuits on board vary, but include statements that she was at an [...] "all-night party" [...] with playwright Charles MacArthur, who was traveling without his wife, actress Helen Hayes. Brundage discussed the matter with fellow AOC members, then met with Jarrett. Although the AOC attempted to send her home, Jarrett, after pleading in vain for reinstatement, remained in Berlin as a journalist, [...] "to the AOC's horror". In later years, she claimed that Brundage had kicked her off the team because he had propositioned her, and she had turned him down. According to Guttmann, [...] "Brundage has appeared, ever since , {{in the guise of}} a killjoy." [...] Butterfield noted that through the efforts of sportswriters who supported Jarrett, [...] "Brundage became celebrated as a tyrant, snob, hypocrite, dictator and stuffed shirt, as well as just about the meanest man in the <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> sports".|$|E

2500|$|During his life, he {{affected}} {{two generations}} of artists, in Europe and in the United States. Whistler had significant contact and exchanged ideas and ideals with Realist, Impressionist, and Symbolist painters. Famous protégés for a time included Walter Sickert and writer Oscar Wilde. His Tonalism {{had a profound effect}} on many American artists, including John Singer Sargent, William Merritt Chase and Willis Seaver Adams (whom he befriended in Venice). Another significant influence was upon Arthur Frank Mathews, whom Whistler met in Paris in the late 1890s. Mathews took Whistler's Tonalism to San Francisco, spawning a broad use of that technique among turn-of-the-century California artists. As American critic Charles Caffin wrote in 1907:"He did better than attract a few followers and imitators; he influenced the <b>whole</b> <b>world</b> <b>of</b> art. [...] Consciously, or unconsciously, his presence is felt in countless studios; his genius permeates modern artistic thought." ...|$|E

[...] The class was so good that students were still referring to their notes more than 40 years later for new things to read when they developed the literary version of the attitude Fick warned them against with the German phrase, [...] "Ich hab schon alles gesehen." [...] (literally, [...] "I have already all things seen"). As late as 2007, one former Fick student reported that next to his bedside table was Gösta Berling's Saga by Selma Lagerlöf, who in 1909 became the first woman and the first Swede to win the Nobel Prize for literature.|$|E
