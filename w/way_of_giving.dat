5|$|The rivers Mersey and Irwell {{were first}} made navigable {{in the early}} 18th century. Goods were also transported on the Runcorn {{extension}} of the Bridgewater Canal (from 1776) and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (from 1830), but by the late 19th century the Mersey and Irwell Navigation had fallen into disrepair and was often unusable. In addition, Manchester's business community viewed the charges imposed by Liverpool's docks and the railway companies as excessive. A ship canal was therefore proposed as a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> ocean-going vessels direct access to Manchester. The region was suffering {{from the effects of}} the Long Depression, and for the canal's proponents, who argued that the scheme would boost competition and create jobs, the idea of a ship canal made sound economic sense. They initiated a public campaign to enlist support for the scheme, which was first presented to Parliament as a bill in 1882. Faced with stiff opposition from Liverpool, the canal's supporters were unable to gain the necessary Act of Parliament to allow the scheme to go ahead until 1885.|$|E
5|$|Several rebellions erupted {{during the}} regency. The first were the Rebellion of Santa Rita (1831), the Revolt of the Year of the Smoke (1833) and the Cabanada (or War of the Cabanos, 1832–34), which sought {{the return of}} Pedro I and which {{had the support of}} common people, former slaves, and slaves. The death of Pedro I on 24 September 1834 ended their hopes. The {{promulgation}} of the Additional Act in 1834, a constitutional amendment that gave higher administrative and political provincial decentralization, exacerbated conflicts between political parties, as whichever dominated the provinces would also gain control over the electoral and political system. Those parties which lost elections rebelled and tried to assume power by force. Rebellious factions, however, continued to uphold the Throne as a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> the appearance of legitimacy to their actions (that is, they were not in revolt against the monarchy per se). The Cabanagem (1835–40), the Sabinada (1837–38) and the Balaiada (1838–41) all followed this course, even though in some instances provinces attempted to secede and become independent republics (though ostensibly only so long as Pedro II was a minor). The exception was the Ragamuffin War, which began as yet another dispute between political factions in the province of Rio Grande do Sul but quickly evolved into a separatist rebellion financed by the Argentine dictator Don Manuel Rosas. But even in this case, the majority of the province's population, including the largest and most prosperous cities, remained loyal to the Empire.|$|E

25|$|Semiotics {{of culture}} is a {{research}} field within semiotics that attempts to define culture from semiotic perspective and {{as a type of}} human symbolic activity, creation of signs and a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> meaning to everything around. Therefore, here culture is understood as a system of symbols or meaningful signs. Because the main sign system is the linguistic system, the field is usually referred to as semiotics of culture and language. Under this field of study symbols are analyzed and categorized in certain class within the hierarchal system. With postmodernity, metanarratives are no longer as pervasive and thus categorizing these symbols in this postmodern age is more difficult and rather critical.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of a}} decorated, outdoor {{national}} Christmas tree {{originated with}} Frederick Morris Feiker. Feiker was a highly educated engineer {{who had been a}} technical journalist for General Electric from 1906-1907 and editor of Electrical World and Electrical Merchandising from 1915 to 1921. In 1921, Feiker joined the personal staff of United States Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover as a press aide. The Society for Electrical Development (an electrical industry trade group) was {{looking for a way to}} encourage people to purchase more electric Christmas lights and use electricity, and Feiker suggested that President Calvin Coolidge personally light the tree as a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> Christmas lights prominence and social cachet.

500|$|The {{theme of}} loyalty and trust {{is related to}} the novel's other major theme of gender. Ai has {{considerable}} difficulty in completing his mission because of his prejudice against the ambisexual Gethenians and his inability to establish a personal bond with them. Ai's preconceived ideas of how men should behave prevents him from trusting Estraven when the two meet; Ai labels Estraven [...] "womanly" [...] and distrusts him because Estraven exhibits both male and female characteristics. Estraven also faces difficulties communicating with Ai, who does not understand shifgrethor, the Gethenians' indirect <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> and receiving advice.

40|$|This final project {{presents}} the results of a descriptive study on the teacher’s <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> feedback in the class of writing at the third semester students of IAIN Walisongo in the academic year of 2010 / 2011. The primary purpose of the investigation is to describe the kinds of feedback implemented by the teacher in the class of writing and the considerations underlying such feedback. The results of this descriptive study will be useful inputs in relation to the implementation of teacher feedback in the class of writing. This makes sense since the teacher’s <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> feedback are influential on writing achievement. Thus, identifying considerations influencing the implementation of teacher feedback to students’ writing will {{contribute to the development of}} further writing achievement. To obtain the data, interviews with the teacher of writing and three students of Writing 2 were conducted. In addition, direct observation was done. Document review was also involved in this study. After analyzing the data, the teacher’s <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> such feedback were identified. The results of the study, in summary, were quite positive in finding that, for some reasons, the teacher has focused on both form and content of the students’ writing, has provided the feedback on the end of writing process and has preferred to use oral feedback as well as direct and indirect feedback. However, both the teacher and students have encountered a number of difficulties during the implementation of the teacher feedback. Therefore, suggestions have been investigated to deal with the problems. In addition, limitations of the study and recommendation are given for future related studies. Finally, the study is expected to be beneficial to the teacher, students, and staffs of the faculty who are in charge of the issue...|$|R

500|$|By {{the middle}} of the century medieval ruined castles had become fashionable once again. They were {{considered}} an interesting counterpoint to the now conventional Palladian classical architecture, and a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> a degree of medieval allure to their new owners. Historian Oliver Creighton suggests that the ideal image of a castle by the 1750s included [...] "broken, soft silhouettes and [...] decayed, rough appearance". In some cases the countryside surrounding existing castles was remodelled to highlight the ruins, as at Henderskelfe Castle, or at [...] "Capability" [...] Brown's reworking of Wardour Castle. Alternatively, ruins might be repaired and reinforced to present a more suitable appearance, as at Harewood Castle. In other cases mottes, such as that at Groby Castle, were reused as the bases for dramatic follies, or alternatively entirely new castle follies could be created; either from scratch or by reusing original stonework, as occurred during the building of Conygar Tower for which various parts of Dunster Castle were cannibalised.|$|E
500|$|Under Edward's rule, parliament's {{importance}} grew as a {{means of}} making political decisions and answering petitions, although as the historian Claire Valente notes, the gatherings were [...] "still as much an event as an institution". After 1311, parliament began to include, in addition to the barons, the representatives of the knights and burgesses, who in later years would constitute the [...] "commons". Although parliament often opposed raising fresh taxes, active opposition to Edward came largely from the barons, rather than parliament itself, although the barons did seek to use the parliamentary meetings as a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> legitimacy to their long-standing political demands. After resisting it for many years, Edward began intervening in parliament {{in the second half of}} his reign to achieve his own political aims. It remains unclear whether Edward was deposed in 1327 by a formal gathering of parliament or simply a gathering of the political classes alongside an existing parliament.|$|E

500|$|The {{phrase is}} likely to have {{originated}} in the Kingdom of Israel following the Law of Moses in beth din courts as a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>giving</b> credence to the authority of God as the author of all law. It {{is likely to}} have come from Deuteronomy 16:18 where it stated: [...] "Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, tribe by tribe; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment". This gave rise to the theory that judges had been given authority from God to exercise judgment on matters of the law and would use the phrase to attribute this fact to God. The phrase continued to be used in courts, passing from Jewish to Christian context as a way to continue to affirm God as the highest authority in law. Clarence Darrow, Oliver O'Donovan and the Chicago Law Journal have stated that the phrase's continual usage may have come about as a result of judges feeling that while they could pass a sentence of death upon a person, they personally did not have the authority to destroy souls and that only God had the authority to do that. As a result, some judges would cross their fingers whenever they said the phrase as a result of concern for the criminal's soul as they said it as a prayer. While the phrase is intended to be said by judges with conviction, it is also said because of legal tradition and not necessarily due to belief in its meaning. During the 17th century in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Puritan majority of judges at the time did not believe that stating [...] "may God have mercy on your soul" [...] had any meaning unless the accused had made a confession of the crime in open court. They, and other Puritan office holders, would also regularly press the condemned up until the point of execution to make a confession of the crime they had been convicted of to ensure that the phrase satisfactorily had meaning according to their views.|$|E
