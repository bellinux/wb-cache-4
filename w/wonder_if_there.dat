500|$|The duet of [...] "I Gotta Be Me" [...] by Finn and Mike was {{considered}} to be [...] "shockingly adorable" [...] by Berk, who gave it four stars out of five. Slezak was less impressed: [...] "The jazz band arrangement and the Mike-teaches-Finn-some-moves choreography was cute, I guess, but it's not a good sign that I spent half the number focusing on Mike's matching green t-shirt and shoe laces." [...] He went on to question the song's inclusion—"In an episode about confronting one's greatest teenage insecurities, I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> might have been a better choice for a solo than the popular football player with the cheerleader girlfriend lamenting his inability to dance"—and ultimately gave the performance a [...] "B−". Futterman also commented on the song's selection, though from a slightly different angle: [...] "In theory it's charming—and there are definitely moments of the 'I can dance/You can't dance' exchange that were enjoyable—but we couldn't ever imagine this song as something Finn would have voluntarily picked." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is {{a reason}} why the {{apostrophe}} is used for Earl's Court station {{but not for the}} nearby Barons Court. William Palliser developed the Barons Court estate. [...] A book in the Society of Genealogists, annotated in pencil by R. Burnet Morris who knew Sir William personally, provides a history of the area. Morris declared Barons Court was named [...] "after Sir William's Irish Estates", Baronscourt. As a result, unlike its neighbouring station, Earl's Court, it is not written with an apostrophe.|$|E
2500|$|Dickens's {{serialisation}} of {{his novels}} was not uncriticised by other authors. In Robert Louis Stevenson's novel The Wrecker, {{there is a}} comment by Captain Nares, investigating an abandoned ship: [...] "See! They were writing up the log," [...] said Nares, pointing to the ink-bottle. [...] "Caught napping, as usual. I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his log-book up to date? He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break, like Charles Dickens and his serial novels." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} that Helena and William's mother Sarah {{had developed a}} reputation of exaggerated claims about the Sidis family. Helena had also falsely claimed that the Civil Service exam William took in 1933 was an IQ test and that his ranking was an IQ score of 254. It is speculated that the number [...] "254" [...] was actually William's placement on the list after he passed the Civil Service exam, as he stated in a letter sent to his family. Helena also claimed that [...] "Billy knew all the languages in the world, while my father only knew twenty-seven. I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> were any Billy didn’t know." [...] This claim was not backed by any other source outside the Sidis family, and Sarah Sidis also made an improbable claim in her 1950 book The Sidis Story that William could learn a language in just one day. Boris Sidis had once dismissed tests of intelligence as [...] "silly, pedantic, absurd, and grossly misleading".|$|E
2500|$|In June 2013, New York {{magazine}} {{reported that}} in a recent Facebook post, Wolf had expressed her [...] "creeping concern" [...] that NSA leaker Edward Snowden, [...] "...is not who he purports to be, and that the motivations involved in the story may be more complex than they appear to be." [...] Wolf was similarly skeptical of Snowden's, [...] "...very pretty pole-dancing Facebooking girlfriend who appeared for, well, no reason in the media coverage ... and who keeps leaking commentary, so her picture can be recycled in the press." [...] Wolf responded at her website, [...] "I do find {{a great deal of}} media/blog discussion about serious questions such as those I raised, questions that relate to querying some sources of news stories, and their potential relationship to intelligence agencies or to other agendas that may not coincide with the overt narrative, to be extraordinarily ill-informed and naive." [...] Specifically regarding Snowden, she wrote, [...] "Why should it be seen as bizarre to <b>wonder,</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> are some potential red flags—the key term is 'wonder'—if a former NSA spy turned apparent whistleblower might possibly still be—working for the same people he was working for before?" ...|$|E
