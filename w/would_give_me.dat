She played Isabel, the eleven-year-old daughter of a widowed attorney turned fugitive, played by Robert Redford, who also directed the film. Jon Weisman wrote that Evancho [...] "showed she's more than a singing prodigy with her earnest sweetness". Redford cast Evancho only days before filming began. Evancho said in 2012: [...] "I don't think I want to act full-time. I think I might like {{to do something with}} a Disney special or make a movie once in a while that <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> enough time to sing and record, but that's about it." ...|$|E

He told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I wanted to do [...] because I {{wanted to get the}} exposure that <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> box-office credibility so I can write movies for myself." [...] In his eight seasons with the show Hartman became known for his impressions, and performed as over 70 different characters. Hartman's original Saturday Night Live characters included Eugene, the Anal Retentive Chef and Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer. His impressions included Frank Sinatra, Ronald Reagan, Ed McMahon, Barbara Bush, Charlton Heston, Phil Donahue and Bill Clinton; the last was often considered his best-known impression.|$|E

Strummer later described how seriously the band devoted itself to forging a distinct identity: [...] "We were almost Stalinist {{in the way that}} you had to shed all your friends, or everything that you'd known, or every way that you'd played before." [...] Strummer and Jones shared most of the writing duties—"Joe <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> the words and I would make a song out of them", Jones later said. Sometimes they would meet in the office over their Camden rehearsal studio to collaborate directly. According to a later description of Strummer's, [...] "Bernie [...] would say, 'An issue, an issue.

500|$|Joe Johnston {{had been}} {{interested}} in directing the sequel to Jurassic Park and approached Spielberg, a friend of his, about the project. While Spielberg wanted to direct the first sequel, he agreed {{that if there was}} ever a third film, Johnston could direct. The second film, entitled , included the scene of the Tyrannosaurus rampaging through San Diego. Spielberg had initially wanted the scene to be saved for a third film, but later decided to add it into the second film after realizing that he would probably not direct another film in the series. After the release of the second film in May 1997, Spielberg was busy with other projects and was asked {{about the possibility of a}} third Jurassic Park film; he responded, [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a tremendous Advil headache just to think about it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] {{became a}} Radio Disney hit, {{remaining}} at number one for 12 weeks. The song's success ultimately benefited Milian's {{career as a}} performer; she explained, [...] "I never realized that show <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> so much exposure. It's great because people have grown with me, even with that damn song. Didn’t know {{so many people were}} watching Kim Possible like that. Because of that song, it actually inspired me to do my own musical animated artist {{because a lot of people}} thought I was Kim Possible." [...] Milian has yet to perform the song live in concert but has expressed interest in recording a remix for fans. [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] was the first song Lerios and Gabriel wrote together, and the songwriting duo has since gone on to collaborate on both scoring and writing songs for several other major television networks and programs.|$|E

500|$|Sibelius was {{not easily}} stirred from his exile; {{friend and fellow}} {{composer}} Wilhelm Stenhammar, then Artistic Director and chief conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, wrote to Sibelius repeatedly {{to persuade him to}} conduct a concert of his works in Gothenburg. Believing himself duty-bound to premiere a [...] "major work" [...] in Sweden, such as a symphony, Sibelius—to Stenhammar's chagrin—delayed each scheduled trip. He withdrew from planned concerts for March 1914, writing to Stenhammar, [...] "My conscience forces me to this. But when I have some new works ready next year, as I hope, it <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> great joy to perform them in Gothenburg". New arrangements were made for February 1915, but these, too, Sibelius canceled in December 1914. In the end, the indefatigable Stenhammar prevailed and new concerts were set for March 1915 ("I see yet again your great sympathy for my music. I shall come".).|$|E
500|$|The {{next week}} on another ride home, a similar {{conversation}} ensued, this one culminating in Brownlee forcing a resisting MacMillan into the car's back seat where he partially penetrated her against her will. [...] Two weeks later, she alleged, they had complete consensual intercourse. [...] After, when she expressed concern about becoming pregnant, {{he told her that}} [...] "he knew of some pills that he <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> and if I took them {{at the end of each}} month before I menstruated that they would be very safe and there would not be any danger of me becoming pregnant." [...] MacMillan recounted that their relationship continued in this way, with sex occurring an average of three times per week. [...] In September 1931, she stayed in the Brownlee house for three days while Mrs. Brownlee was in Vancouver; she alleged that during that time, Brownlee had his son, who usually slept in Brownlee's room, transferred to a different room so that Brownlee and MacMillan could have sex.|$|E
500|$|When a {{group of}} about 50 ZANU–PF activists briefly invaded Gwenoro in May 2000, Smith played down the incident, saying the intruders were just bored and out of work. [...] "There's no {{politics}} on the farm," [...] he said. Five months later, in England to address the Oxford Union, Smith described Mugabe as [...] "mentally deranged". The President announced in response that Smith would be arrested and tried for genocide if he ever came back to Zimbabwe, a threat that Smith mocked. [...] "I would love that. Let him try it," [...] he said—"It <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> the chance to tell the world the truth about this gangster... I will give him the date and time of arrival of my plane so he can meet me at the airport." [...] A mass of reporters descended on Harare International Airport on 7 November 2000 to witness Smith's arrest, but far from being detained, the former Prime Minister was greeted cheerily by immigration officers and allowed through without any obstruction. Telling the waiting pressmen that he was disappointed not to have met any confrontation, he commented: [...] "We have a president here who is mentally unstable and makes statements that have no bearing on reality", and went home unmolested.|$|E

500|$|During {{the period}} when Garrow worked as a barrister, the sugar {{planters}} of the West Indies held large amounts of power in Parliament, allowing them to maintain a monopoly on the marketing of sugar in England that brought great profits. This industry was largely profitable due {{to the use of}} slave labour, to which Garrow had long been opposed; when the sugar planters offered him a job managing all of their legal and political business, he replied that [...] "if your committee <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> their whole incomes, and all their estates, I would not be seen as the advocate of practices which I abhor, and a system which I detest". In 1806 Thomas Picton, the Governor of Trinidad, was charged with a single count of [...] "causing torture to be unlawfully inflicted" [...] on a young free mulatto girl; he was brought before the Court of King's Bench under Lord Ellenborough. The court records run to 367 pages, and Garrow was deeply involved as prosecuting counsel; indeed, his opening speech on 24 February 1806 is considered by Braby to be one of his best. The case centred on whether or not Spanish law, which allowed torture, was still in effect {{at the time of the}} incident. The jury eventually decided that it was not, and Ellenborough found Picton guilty. Picton's counsel requested a retrial, which was granted; the jury in the second trial eventually decided that Picton was innocent.|$|E
500|$|As {{her story}} {{progresses}} following her constant manipulative behavior, Chloe reveals her true identity: Kate Valentine, {{the daughter of}} the Chancellor maid Esther Valentine (Kate Linder). The storyline was dubbed [...] "Chloe is Kate". Hendrickson was pleased that the writers decided to give Chloe a backstory, saying, [...] "I was so excited when I found out Chloe was going to have some family ties. I knew it <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>me,</b> as an actor, a chance to finally explain to viewers why Chloe is the way she is." [...] The actress felt that her family reveal proved that she's not [...] "this bitch who likes to destroy people's lives", attesting her behavior to not being raised by parents; [...] "She never had anyone tell her wrong from right," [...] Hendrickson stated. Her backstory revealed that Chloe hadn't seen her mother or her employer Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) since she [...] "was young and overweight with braces". Kate Linder was also pleased with the writing direction, describing it as an [...] "honor" [...] to work with Hendrickson. She said, [...] "When they decided to bring [...] back, I was stunned and pleasantly surprised. Maria Bell called me and {{told me that it was}} top secret. It was a great reveal." [...] Chloe initially gives Esther the cold shoulder. Of her reasoning behind this, Hendrickson said, [...] "Chloe is very young and immature — as well, hurt and ashamed about her upbringing. She’s not going to let her mother forget it easily." [...] She described their initial relationship as [...] "realistic" [...] and similar to [...] "a lot of mother-and-daughter relationships".|$|E
2500|$|To {{avoid the}} many {{visitors}} at Monticello, Thomas Jefferson in 1806 built a home near Lynchburg, called Poplar Forest. He often visited the town, noting, [...] "Nothing <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> greater pleasure {{than to be}} useful {{to the town of}} Lynchburg. I consider it as the most interesting spot in the state." [...] In 1810, Jefferson wrote, [...] "Lynchburg is perhaps the most rising place in the U.S....

2500|$|Following his conversion, Miller's Deist friends soon {{challenged}} him {{to justify his}} newfound faith. He did so by examining the Bible closely, declaring to one friend [...] "If he <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> time, I would harmonize all these apparent contradictions to my own satisfaction, or I will be a Deist still." [...] Miller commenced with Genesis 1:1, studying each verse and not moving on until he felt the meaning was clear. In this way he became convinced firstly, that postmillennialism was unbiblical; and secondly, that the time of Christ's Second Coming was revealed in Bible prophecy.|$|E
2500|$|His {{reputation}} among actors {{is quite}} different, however. With them, his independence sometimes extended to {{his choice of}} actors, often going against consensus.

[...] "Without Bob I would {{have never had a}} film career. Everyone told him not to cast me. Everyone[...] [...] [...] Nobody <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a break. I am convinced that Bob {{was the only one who}} was brave enough to do it." [...] Others, like Julianne Moore, describes working with him: ...|$|E
2500|$|Carpenter cast James Woods as Jack Crow {{because he}} wanted [...] "the vampire slayer to be as savage as the prey he’s after. James Woods {{is the kind of}} guy you'd believe could and would chew off the leg of a vampire." [...] Woods was {{interested}} in doing the film because it was something different for him. Contrary to his reputation, Carpenter didn't find the actor difficult to work with because [...] "we had a deal. He <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> one take as it's written and I would let him improvise...Many of his improvisations were brilliant. When I needed him to be more focused and disciplined, I had the take from the script that was straighter." ...|$|E
