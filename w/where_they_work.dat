5|$|Chao {{have also}} made {{occasional}} appearances in Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog comic book series. They debuted in an Sonic Adventure-based story arc, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>work</b> together with Tikal to defeat Chaos. At one point, Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles find a Chao garden and one Chao followed Sonic home, and after spending time around his Roboticized father came to resemble Omochao. However, Eggman destroys the garden, and the Chao migrate to a lake. Much later, Cream and her mother Vanilla protect a frightened but incompetent group of Chao from Eggman's assistant, Snively. Cream's friend Amy Rose realizes {{they are the same}} group from the lake and, to Cream's delight, suggests that the lake can be converted to a Chao garden. Following the comic reboot, Cheese continued to accompany Cream while Chocola was revealed to live with her mother Vanilla and Gemerl (from Sonic Advance 3). The heroes would also discover a Chao Garden hidden in an undersea cavern whose inhabitants included an ancient Chao named Aquarius and a guard dog-like Chao named Crusher.|$|E

25|$|The Alutiiq, {{also called}} Pacific Yupik or Sugpiaq, are a southern, coastal branch of Yupik. They {{are not to}} be {{confused}} with the Aleut, who live further to the southwest, including along the Aleutian Islands. They traditionally lived a coastal lifestyle, subsisting primarily on ocean resources such as salmon, halibut, and whales, as well as rich land resources such as berries and land mammals. Alutiiq people today live in coastal fishing communities, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>work</b> in all aspects of the modern economy. They also maintain the cultural value of subsistence.|$|E
25|$|At present, 999 calls - {{whether by}} mobile {{telephone}} or landline - are answered by a BT operator, who feeds {{the call to}} a fire, police, ambulance, or coastguard Emergency Control Centre as required. Staff, known as control operators or control officers, also despatch the fire appliances, maintain radio communications and provide detailed risk and geographical information. These operators are employed by a FRS, wear a similar uniform to firefighters, and have their own rank structure.

25|$|The {{introduction}} of Shanna the She-Devil into Ka-Zar’s supporting cast changes Morse’s {{role in the}} stories of this period. Ka-Zar expresses clear attraction to the more jungle-friendly Shanna from the outset and Morse is cast as the secondary love interest. This dynamic is most notable in Morse’s lone appearance in the Ka-Zar strip in the black-and-white magazine Savage Tales (#8; Jan. 1975). Written by Gerry Conway, the story depicts Morse leading Shanna {{and a group of}} S.H.I.E.L.D. agents into the Savage Land <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>work</b> with Ka-Zar to neutralise a threat to world security. During the course of the adventure Morse realises that Ka-Zar’s affections lie with Shanna. This story, first published in late-1974, is the last in which Morse appears as a Ka-Zar supporting character.|$|E

Pacino portrays a {{recently}} paroled cook who begins {{a relationship with}} a waitress (Pfeiffer) in the diner <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>work.</b> It was adapted by Terrence McNally from his own Off-Broadway play Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune (1987), that featured Kenneth Welsh and Kathy Bates. The film received mixed reviews, although Pacino later said he enjoyed playing the part. Janet Maslin in The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Pacino has not been this uncomplicatedly appealing since his [...] "Dog Day Afternoon" [...] days, and he makes Johnny's endless enterprise in wooing Frankie a delight. His scenes alone with Ms. Pfeiffer have a precision and honesty that keep the film's maudlin aspects at bay." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lifestyles for rising {{professionals}} in Detroit reflect {{those of other}} major cities. A 2007 study found that Detroit's new downtown residents are predominantly young professionals (57 percent are ages 25–34, 45 percent have bachelor's degrees, 34 percent have a master's or professional degree). This dynamic is luring many younger residents to the downtown area. Some are choosing {{to live in the}} grandiose mansions of Grosse Pointe in order to be closer to the urban scene. The [...] river east development is a plan investing billions of dollars in a new mixed use residential, commercial, and retail space for downtown Detroit to serve the people <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>work</b> and live. To spearhead the development, Michigan created the William G. Milliken State Park and Harbor downtown along the Detroit International Riverfront. In 2007, downtown Detroit was named among the best big city neighborhoods in which to retire by CNN Money Magazine editors. In 2008, Troy, Michigan ranked as the fourth most affordable U.S. city with a median household income of 78,800. Oakland County is the fourth wealthiest county in the United States among counties with more than one million people.|$|E
2500|$|The global justice {{movement}} is the loose collection {{of individuals and}} groups—often {{referred to as a}} [...] "movement of movements"—who advocate fair trade rules and perceive current institutions of global economic integration as problems. [...] The {{movement is}} often labeled an anti-globalization movement by the mainstream media. Those involved, however, frequently deny that they are anti-globalization, insisting that they support the globalization of communication and people and oppose only the global expansion of corporate power. The movement is based in the idea of social justice, desiring the creation of a society or institution based on the principles of equality and solidarity, the values of human rights, and the dignity of every human being. Social inequality within and between nations, including a growing global digital divide, is a focal point of the movement. Many nongovernmental organizations have now arisen to fight these inequalities that many in Latin America, Africa and Asia face. A few very popular and well known non-governmental organizations (NGOs) include: War Child, Red Cross, Free The Children and CARE International. They often create partnerships <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>work</b> towards improving the lives of those who live in developing countries by building schools, fixing infrastructure, cleaning water supplies, purchasing equipment and supplies for hospitals, and other aid efforts.|$|E

2500|$|The usual {{arrangement}} on {{a compound}} engine {{is that the}} steam is first expanded {{in one or two}} high-pressure (HP) cylinder(s), then having given up heat and losing pressure, it exhausts into a larger-volume low-pressure (LP) cylinder, (or two, - or more), thus extending the cycle. Thus the cylinders can be said to work in [...] "series" [...] as opposed to the normal arrangement of a simple-expansion locomotive <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>work</b> in [...] "parallel", the steam being expanded just once in any one cylinder. In order to balance piston thrusts of a compound, the HP:LP cylinder volume ratio has to be carefully determined, usually by increasing the LP cylinder diameter and/or by lengthening the stroke. [...] In non-condensing engines, the HP:LP volume ratio is usually 1:2¼. [...] On geared locomotives, cylinder volumes can be kept more or less identical by increasing LP piston speed. [...] Strictly speaking compound only stands for double-expansion, but the term is loosely applied to any multiple-expansion engine. The instances where railway locomotives have employed triple-expansion with steam going from high-pressure (HP) cylinder, to medium-pressure (MP) cylinder and finally to a low-pressure (LP) one are rare, but triple-expansion engines were very common in steamships in the late 19th/early 20th centuries.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, Nogueira {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Combate that he had undergone stem cell therapy on his elbows, hips and knees. Nogueira said,"They have a clinic in Kansas <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>work</b> with stem cells. What they do is they remove some cells from fat out of your back and then inject them in your joints. I did it on my elbows, my hips and knees. It stimulates cartilage growth. It's pretty cutting edge technique. I'm responding really well so far. It's been helping a lot with my pain. I'm still doing physiotherapy, which is responsible for curing my hips, but I'm now doing this to make it even stronger. I had a break between my last fight and The Ultimate Fighter shootings, so I decided to go for it."Nogueira also confessed a desire to fight Frank Mir for a third time saying,"In two weeks I'll be cleared to train freely again. First, I will get my body strong enough so I can train and be 100% ready to fight. I intend to fight at UFC 190 in August. I wanted to come back at the TUF finale card, but I'm afraid there won't be enough time. I'll definitely be ready in August. The UFC told me they would put me in a card in August. They didn't say which one, but I'm sure it'll be the one in Rio. I still don't have an opponent. They said there were three different guys I could be fighting, but I can't comment on that. I don't have any preferences really. I just want to come back and fight, but I would like to face Frank Mir again {{before the end of the}} year." ...|$|E
60|$|After this, that {{we might}} not neglect the present in our zeal for the past, {{we went to the}} marble yards, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>work</b> the Aberdeen granite. This granite, of which we have many {{specimens}} in America, is of two kinds, one being gray, the other of a reddish hue. It seems to differ from other granite in the fineness and closeness of its grain, which enables it to receive the most brilliant conceivable polish. I saw some superb columns of the red species, which were preparing to go over the Baltic to Riga, for an Exchange; and a sepulchral monument, which was going to New York. All was busy here, sawing, chipping, polishing; as different a scene from the gray old cathedral as could be imagined. The granite finds its way, I suppose, to countries which the old, unsophisticated abbots never dreamed of.|$|E

60|$|Underground {{there exists}} a vast region of shafts and levels, or tunnels--mostly low, narrow, and crooked places--in which men have to stoop and walk with caution, and <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>work</b> by candlelight--a region which is {{measured}} to the inch, and has all its parts mapped out and named as carefully as are the fields above. Some idea {{of the extent of}} this mine may be gathered {{from the fact that it}} is 245 fathoms, (1470 feet), deep, and that all the levels put together form an amount of cutting through almost solid granite equal to nearly 40 miles in extent. The deepest part of the mine is that which lies under the bottom of the sea, three-quarters of a mile from the shore; and, strange to say, that is also the driest part of the mine. The Great Eastern would find depth of water sufficient to permit of her anchoring and floating securely in places where miners are at work, blowing up the solid rock, 1470 feet below her keel--a depth so profound that the wildest waves that ever burst upon the shore, or the loudest thunder that ever reverberated among the cliffs, could not send down the faintest echo of a sound.|$|E
