5|$|The overall {{number of}} viewers rose {{slightly}} for the thirteenth episode, {{the first of}} a two-parter, when it was watched by 157,000 people, but the viewing figures for the key 18–34 demographics was at a low of 81,000. The following week, the episode that concluded the two-parter picked up viewers, reaching an estimated total of 206,000. Brioux commented again about Degrassi: The Next Generation still being on the schedules, <b>wondering</b> <b>when</b> CTV was going to announce its cancellation and noting that The Amazing Race, which follows it in the scheduling, was watched by ten times the number of Degrassis viewers. That pattern was repeated the following week, when Degrassi: The Next Generation was watched by 222,000 viewers, compared to 1,834,000 viewers for The Amazing Race, 1,579,000 viewers for Desperate Housewives and 1,106,000 viewers for The Mentalist, which were broadcast by CTV later in the evening.|$|E
25|$|Not surprisingly, strikes {{increased}} steadily {{from the}} middle of 1915, and so did crime; but, for the most part, people suffered and endured, scouring the city for food. Working class women in St. Petersburg reportedly spent about forty hours a week in food lines, begging, turning to prostitution or crime, tearing down wooden fences to keep stoves heated for warmth, grumbling about the rich, and <b>wondering</b> <b>when</b> and how this would all come to an end.|$|E
500|$|The pilot episode {{received}} acclaim {{from television}} critics. TV Guide's Matt Roush praised {{the marriage of}} Scorsese and Winter, saying it [...] "... brilliantly marries Martin Scorsese's virtuosic cinematic eye to Terence Winter's panoramic mastery of rich character and eventful story," [...] and finished his review by stating [...] "It's the most purely—and impurely—enjoyable storytelling HBO has delivered in ages, like a movie that {{you never want to}} end." [...] Variety's Brian Lowry praised the show for returning network HBO to top form, saying [...] "This is, quite simply, television at its finest, occupying a sweet spot that—for all the able competition—still remains unique to HBO: An expensive, explicit, character-driven program, tackling material no broadcast network or movie studio would dare touch... For those <b>wondering</b> <b>when</b> the channel would deliver another franchise to definitively put it on top of the world, Ma, the wait is over: Go directly to [...] "Boardwalk."" [...] "One of the unexpected joys of [...] "Boardwalk Empire," [...] though, lies in the way the show revels in the oddities of its time, peeling back the layers of polite society to reveal a giddy shadow world of criminals and politicians collaborating to keep the liquor flowing," [...] says online magazine Salon's Heather Havrilesky who went on to call the pilot [...] "breathtaking." [...] Roberto Bianco from USA Today said in his review that Boardwalk Empire was [...] "Extravagantly produced, shockingly violent and as cold and hard as ice, Boardwalk Empire {{brings us back to the}} world's former playground at the start of Prohibition—and brings HBO back to the forefront of the TV-series race." ...|$|E

2500|$|... Josh Rosenblatt of The Austin Chronicle {{dismissed}} the film stating it was [...] "An orgy of mindless violence, a random collection of bloody bodies, alien misanthropy and slobbering carnage designed to bore {{straight into the}} pleasure centers of 13-year-old boys and leave {{the rest of us}} <b>wondering</b> <b>when</b> the movies got so damn loud." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April Fischer {{notified}} Goddard {{that the}} Navy {{wanted to do}} all its rocket work at the Engineering Experiment Station at Annapolis. Esther, worried that a move to the climate of Maryland would cause Robert's health to deteriorate faster, objected. But the patriotic Goddard replied, [...] "Esther, don't you know there's a war on?" [...] Fischer also questioned the move, as Goddard could work just as well in Roswell. Goddard simply answered, [...] "I was <b>wondering</b> <b>when</b> you would ask me." [...] Fischer had wanted to offer him something bigger—a long range missile—but JATO {{was all he could}} manage, hoping for a greater project later. It was a case of a square peg in a round hole, according to a disappointed Goddard.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{his failure}} in the debut match, Rahane was {{included}} in the playing eleven for the first match of India's tour of South Africa (2013–14). [...] Batting in the lower-middle order, he made 209 runs at an average of 69.66 in the series (including a 96 of 157 balls at Kingsmead, Durban) against the bowling attack comprising Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander. [...] "For a man who had spent many a tour and series warming up the bench, carrying drinks, <b>wondering</b> <b>when</b> his opportunity will come, he has taken his chance with both hands, even though it arrived in the most difficult of conditions to bat in", cricket pundit Sidharth Monga wrote. Rahane finished as India's third-highest run-getter in the series, but he was in the most precarious position of all before the series began.|$|E
2500|$|Nick Cotton {{has become}} one of EastEnders most renowned villains. His 'nastiness' was voted the 25th [...] "Greatest Soap Moment" [...] in a Five poll in 2004, and he has also been voted the 4th most villainous {{television}} character in a Channel 4 poll. The Guardian columnist Charlie Brooker has denied Nick's villainous characterisation however, writing: [...] "The man simply isn't menacing; he's half as terrifying as an Argos catalogue. Whereas [...] Jez Quigley looked as though he'd enjoy riding an onyx stallion through a field full of groaning, recently-impaled victims before galloping home to bathe in the blood of the fallen, Nick Cotton merely looks like he might, at a push, dispute the price of a dented tin of custard with a supermarket checkout girl while you wait behind him, <b>wondering</b> <b>when</b> he last washed his hair." [...] The Timess Fiona McCade satirised the character when Altman appeared on the children's TV show Balamory, advising parents to: [...] "be prepared to cover your little ones’ eyes as the bad boy of soap strides into the colourful, fictional paradise, no doubt goosing Miss Hoolie, upsetting PC Plum and making Josie jump. I also fear for the safety of Archie, the chubby, cheerful posh boy who wears a pink kilt and lives alone in a big pink castle. With Nick in town, he doesn’t stand a chance." ...|$|E
