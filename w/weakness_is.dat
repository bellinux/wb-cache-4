5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in late evening or {{the early hours of}} the morning. The <b>weakness</b> <b>is</b> usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Philip {{engaged in a}} flurry of {{diplomatic}} activity. He bribed Berisades, son of the Thracian king Cotys, to withdraw Thracian support for Pausanias, and thereby prevented the Thracian invasion. Similarly, he bought off the Paionians with gifts in exchange for their withdrawal from Macedon. Philip may also have concluded a treaty with the victorious Dardanian king Bardylis, possibly surrendering large parts of Macedon in exchange for peace. Although no evidence remains of such a treaty, the fact that Illyrians did not follow up their victory despite Macedon's <b>weakness</b> <b>is</b> suggestive that some agreement was reached. Philip also married Bardylis's daughter (or niece), which may have formed part of the treaty. At any rate, Philip's diplomacy gave Macedon some breathing space and time for recovery.|$|E

5|$|Noda is a {{self-reliant}} {{young man}} who executes the strategies formed by the SSS and fights with a halberd. He does not listen to anyone other than Yuri, for whom he has adoration, and is antagonistic to almost everyone else. He has a one-sided rivalry with Otonashi. He is a complete idiot whose <b>weakness</b> <b>is</b> education; at one point, Takeyama is able to knock him out by reciting pi. He {{is not afraid to}} harm or kill anyone who gets in Yuri's way. Though he prefers to fight with his halberd, he sometimes uses guns out of necessity, the type of weaponry that he hates.|$|E
5|$|The {{second of}} these {{theories}} is the genocide hypothesis, which {{asserts that the}} aboriginal populations of the Northern and Western Isles were eradicated and replaced wholesale with settlers of Scandinavian stock. The strength of this argument is the almost total replacement of pre-existing place names by those of Norse origin {{throughout much of the}} region. Its <b>weakness</b> <b>is</b> that the place name evidence is from a relatively late date and the nature of this transition remains controversial. Genetic studies show that Shetlanders have almost identical proportions of Scandinavian matrilineal and patrilineal ancestry, suggesting that the islands were settled by both men and women in equal measure.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} from LEMS typically {{involves the}} muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. <b>Weakness</b> <b>is</b> often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).|$|E

25|$|Weakness or muscle {{weakness}} (especially {{in the large}} muscles of the arms and legs). This latter occurs in 60 to 80 percent of patients with untreated hyperthyroidism. Muscle <b>weakness</b> <b>is</b> rarely the chief complaint. The likelihood and degree of muscle <b>weakness</b> <b>is</b> correlated with the duration and severity of the hyperthyroid state, and becomes more likely {{after the age of}} 40. Muscle strength returns gradually over several months after the hyperthyroidism has been treated.|$|E

25|$|Just as Daredevil's other senses are stronger, {{they are}} also sensitive; his main <b>weakness</b> <b>is</b> his {{vulnerability}} to powerful sounds or odors that can temporarily weaken his radar sense. This <b>weakness</b> <b>is</b> often used to immobilize Daredevil. Alternately, the lack of taste or smell of certain substances can be used against him, as in one instance of a hallucinogenic drug designed so that Daredevil could not tell he was drugged. His senses are highly acute, capable of sensing the minor atmospheric disturbance created moments before a teleporting character appears.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} into integrating a database Natural Language Processing (NLP) component into the SQL-Tutor Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) is presented. Tailor-made NLP systems {{created by a}} programmer, and NLP systems created automatically by a general database NLP system, are considered {{with respect to the}} requirements of SQL-Tutor. A tailor-made system is created for the MOVIES database using a semantic grammar, and its strengths and <b>weaknesses</b> <b>are</b> demonstrated. Three `levels' of information are identified in the tailor-made system; database independent information, database structure and database semantics. These levels are used to assess a commercial system for automatic database NLP generation. Some <b>weaknesses</b> <b>are</b> identified in this system and a proposal of an `authoring tool' to remedy these <b>weaknesses</b> <b>is</b> presented...|$|R

25|$|Myasthenia gravis is a {{neuromuscular disease}} leading to {{fluctuating}} muscle weakness and fatigability during simple activities. <b>Weakness</b> <b>is</b> typically caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors at the post-synaptic neuromuscular junction, inhibiting the stimulative {{effect of the}} neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Myasthenia is treated with immunosuppressants, cholinesterase inhibitors and, in selected cases, thymectomy.|$|E

25|$|Weakness or {{asthenia}} is {{a symptom}} of a number of different conditions. The causes are many and can be divided into conditions that have true or perceived muscle weakness. True muscle <b>weakness</b> <b>is</b> a primary symptom of a variety of skeletal muscle diseases, including muscular dystrophy and inflammatory myopathy. It occurs in neuromuscular junction disorders, such as myasthenia gravis.|$|E
25|$|A {{weakness}} of the Scoville Organoleptic Test is its imprecision due to human subjectivity, depending on the taster's palate and their number of mouth heat receptors, which varies greatly among people. Another <b>weakness</b> <b>is</b> sensory fatigue; the palate is quickly desensitized to capsaicinoids after tasting a few samples {{within a short time}} period. Results vary widely (up to ± 50%) between laboratories.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of one new good to a single-good market allows for opportunity costs {{to be determined}} only in relation to that other good.

25|$|This {{apparent}} <b>weakness</b> <b>is</b> {{balanced by}} mutual-aid systems established by extended {{family members to}} provide emotional and economic support. Older family members pass on social and cultural traditions such as religion and manners to younger family members. In turn, the older family members are cared for by younger family members when they cannot care for themselves. These relationships exist at all economic levels in the African-American community, providing strength and support both to the African-American family and the community.|$|E

He can also shoot powerful electrical bolts from his palms which, if fired downward, are capable of launching him high into the air. His primary <b>weakness</b> <b>is</b> water.

However, Mulwray escaped and managed to join Mutant X along with Emma DeLauro.|$|E
25|$|The {{province}} {{played an}} important role in Byzantine relations with the Khazars and later, after the Khazar Khaganate's collapse, with the Pechenegs and the Rus'. It was a center for Byzantine diplomacy rather than military activity, since the military establishment in the theme seems to have been small and to have chiefly consisted of a locally raised militia. Its <b>weakness</b> <b>is</b> underlined by the stipulation, in the Byzantine treaties with the Rus' of 945 and 971, of the latter's undertaking to defend it against the Volga Bulgars.|$|E
