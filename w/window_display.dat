5|$|Henry Edward Roberts studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Miami before enlisting in the U.S. Air Force in 1962. He {{soon became}} an {{electronics}} {{instructor at the}} Cryptographic Equipment Maintenance School at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. To augment his meager enlisted man's pay, Roberts worked on several off-duty projects and even set up a one-man company, Reliance Engineering. The most notable job was to create the electronics that animated the Christmas characters in the <b>window</b> <b>display</b> of Joske's department store in San Antonio. In 1965, he was selected for an Air Force program to complete his college degree, and became a commissioned officer. Roberts earned an Electrical Engineering degree from Oklahoma State University in 1968 and {{was assigned to the}} Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexico.|$|E

It was the centrepiece of the show, Stuckist Clowns Doing Their Dirty Work, the first exhibition of the Stuckists in Mayfair, and depicted Saatchi with a sheep at his feet and a halo made from a cheese wrapper. The Saatchi Gallery said that Saatchi [...] "would not have any problem" [...] with the painting's display. The gallery announced they were shutting down the show. Harvey said, [...] "I did it to make Saatchi look friendly and human. It's a ludicrous decision".|$|E

2500|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, pop art was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting; some of these pioneers, such as Roy Lichtenstein, would later become synonymous with the movement. Warhol, who would become famous as the [...] "Pope of Pop", turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images taken from cartoons and advertisements, hand-painted with paint drips. Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done and it was very popular. Those drips emulated the style of successful abstract expressionists (such as Willem de Kooning). Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961, serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bronwit Teller's <b>window</b> <b>display.</b> This was the same stage his Pop Art contemporaries Jasper Johns, James Rosenquist and Robert Rauschenberg had also once graced.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{the rest}} of Jämtland Östersund is heavily {{dominated}} by many small businesses. The city is the centre of trade and commerce in Jämtland County and has well over 300 different shops. The retail trade's turnover is 30 per cent higher than it ought to be, {{given the number of}} inhabitants the city has. Trade in the central business district (Staden – the City) is mostly concentrated to the shopping and pedestrian street Prästgatan where large local shopping malls such as Kärnan and Mittpunkten along with department stores such as Åhléns are located. Large clothing companies such as H, Lindex and smaller like WESC etc., approximately 50 restaurants, shoe stores, sporting goods retailers like Stadium and Intersport, several supermarkets (Östersund has rather few convenience stores) and much more. Storgatan, the street that runs parallel with Prästgatan is also lined with shops, restaurants and coffeehouses. Unlike Prästgatan this street is not a pedestrian street. Östersund is the city in Sweden with the most square metres of <b>window</b> <b>display</b> per capita. The most prominent figure in Östersund's business life throughout the 20th century was the car salesman (started out selling horses) Sven O. Persson, founder of Persson Invest, Byggelit and Bilbolaget. [...] Nowadays the most distinguishing businessman is Maths O.
