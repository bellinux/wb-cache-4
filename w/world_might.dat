5|$|In June 2012, Sea World {{applied for}} a permit to {{demolish}} the Bermuda Triangle water ride system and the interior of its show building. The Bermuda Triangle had been sitting dormant since its closure in October 2010 and had been earmarked by the park as a site for a future attraction. On 12 July 2012, Christian von Elverfeldt from Mack Rides revealed Australia would be receiving a water roller coaster in 2013; leading to speculation that Sea <b>World</b> <b>might</b> have revived its plans. Further development application filings, and reports by the Roller Coaster DataBase and the Gold Coast Bulletin, confirmed this speculation. In September 2012, Sea World asked Austrian firm Dynamic Motion Rides (DyMoRides) to develop a theming and show design concept for the yet-to-be-announced Storm Coaster. DyMoRides was ultimately contracted for the full turnkey project in April 2013. DyMoRides subsequently contracted PEL Creative for creative direction, Full-On Lighting for lighting design, Volume One for audio and visual effects, and Sculpt Studios for theming design.|$|E

Lee says that her “…sense of ‘home’ is a spectrum of emotions…of yearning for belonging, wholeness, and rootedness.” The possibility that these two <b>worlds</b> <b>might</b> coexist is embedded deeply in her work.

In Brave New World Revisited, he concluded that the world was becoming like Brave New World much faster than he originally thought.|$|E

25|$|Edward Fredkin and Konrad Zuse {{pioneered the}} idea of a computable universe, the former by writing a line in his book on how the <b>world</b> <b>might</b> be like a {{cellular}} automaton, and later further developed by Fredkin using a toy model called Salt. It has been claimed that NKS tries to take these ideas as its own but Wolfram's model of the universe if a rewriting network and not a cellular automaton as Wolfram himself has suggested a cellular automaton cannot account for relativistic features such as no absolute time frame. Jürgen Schmidhuber has also charged that his work on Turing machine-computable physics was stolen without attribution, namely his idea on enumerating possible Turing-computable universes.|$|E
25|$|It {{might seem}} unusual that Hesiod's father {{migrated}} from Asia Minor westwards to mainland Greece, {{the opposite direction}} to most colonial movements at the time, and Hesiod himself gives no explanation for it. However around 750 BC or a little later, there was a migration of seagoing merchants from his original home in Cyme in Asia Minor to Cumae in Campania (a colony they shared with the Euboeans), and possibly his move west {{had something to do}} with that, since Euboea is not far from Boeotia, where he eventually established himself and his family. The family association with Aeolian Cyme might explain his familiarity with eastern myths, evident in his poems, though the Greek <b>world</b> <b>might</b> have already developed its own versions of them.|$|E
25|$|When Sun Quan {{noticed that}} the rivalry between his sons had a polarising effect on his subjects, he forbid his sons from {{interacting}} with the outside world, and ordered them to focus on academic studies. The official Yang Dao (羊衜) wrote a memorial to Sun Quan, urging the emperor to lift the ban on his sons interacting with the outside world. He pointed out that both Sun He and Sun Ba held considerable prestige among the literati and scholar-gentry, who were eager to meet the two princes, so they {{should be allowed to}} interact with the outside world. Yang Dao also explained to Sun Quan that isolating the two princes from the outside <b>world</b> <b>might</b> make people think that Eastern Wu was experiencing internal instability and allow rumours to breed and spread. Sun Quan probably heeded Yang Dao's advice.|$|E

25|$|Once one accepts The Matrix as a {{generated}} {{reality of}} malicious machines invention {{then this is}} Descartes' First Meditation, or evil demon, a hypothesis that the perceived <b>world</b> <b>might</b> be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us. The same premise {{can be found in}} Hilary Putnam's brain in a vat scenario proposed in the 1980s. One can make a connection between the premise of The Matrix and Plato's Allegory of the Cave; once one accepts that The Matrix is an illusion, then the allegory of the cave becomes clear. The allegory is related to Plato's theory of Forms, which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.|$|E
25|$|The {{early stage}} of the siege of Uthman's house was not severe, but as the days passed, the rebels {{intensified}} their pressure against Uthman. With {{the departure of the}} pilgrims from Medina to Mecca, the hands of the rebels were further strengthened, and as a consequence the crisis deepened further. The rebels understood that after the Hajj, the Muslims gathered at Mecca {{from all parts of the}} Muslim <b>world</b> <b>might</b> march to Medina to relieve Uthman. They therefore decided to take action against Uthman before the pilgrimage was over. During the siege, Uthman was asked by his supporters, who outnumbered the rebels, to let them fight against the rebels and rout them. Uthman prevented them in an effort to avoid the bloodshed of Muslim by Muslim. Unfortunately for Uthman, violence still occurred. The gates of the house of Uthman were shut and guarded by the renowned warrior, Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr. The sons of Ali, Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali, were also among the guards.|$|E
25|$|This {{century is}} {{essentially}} studied from the Athenian outlook because Athens has left us more narratives, plays, and other written works {{than the other}} ancient Greek states. From the perspective of Athenian culture in Classical Greece, the period generally {{referred to as the}} 5th century BC extends slightly into the 4th century BC. In this context, one might consider that the first significant event of this century occurs in 508 BC, with the fall of the last Athenian tyrant and Cleisthenes' reforms. However, a broader view of the whole Greek <b>world</b> <b>might</b> place its beginning at the Ionian Revolt of 500 BC, the event that provoked the Persian invasion of 492 BC. The Persians were defeated in 490 BC. A second Persian attempt, in 481-479 BC, failed as well, despite having overrun much of modern-day Greece (north of the Isthmus of Corinth) at a crucial point during the war following the Battle of Thermopylae and the Battle of Artemisium. The Delian League then formed, under Athenian hegemony and as Athens' instrument. Athens' excesses caused several revolts among the allied cities, all of which were put down by force, but Athenian dynamism finally awoke Sparta and brought about the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC. After both forces were spent, a brief peace came about; then the war resumed to Sparta's advantage. Athens was definitively defeated in 404 BC, and internal Athenian agitations mark the end of the 5th century BC in Greece.|$|E

The {{question of whether}} other inhabited <b>worlds</b> <b>might</b> exist has been debated since ancient times.
