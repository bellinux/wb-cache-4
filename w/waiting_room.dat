5|$|Dunrobin Castle railway station, on the Far North Line, {{was opened}} in 1870, {{as a private}} station for the castle. The present <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> was {{constructed}} in 1902, and is a category B listed building.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> have seating. Some have {{adjacent}} toilets. It is {{not uncommon}} to find vending machines in public <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> or newspapers and magazines in private <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms.</b> Some <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> have a television or music. Some airports and railway stations have special <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms,</b> often called [...] "lounges", for those who have paid more. These will generally be less crowded and will have superior seating and better facilities. <b>Waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> for high-end services may provide complimentary drinks and snacks.|$|R

5|$|The {{basement}} {{housed the}} boiler room, a smaller <b>waiting</b> <b>room,</b> kitchen storerooms, and baggage rooms. The station {{appears to have}} had two side platforms serving four tracks, accessed through a basement-level tunnel that was reached from the main <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> by a staircase. The steep roof over the center block had several dormers, {{some of which were}} later removed. A covered ramp from the west wing, which had direct access from the south platform, led to a small trolley station on Glenwood Avenue.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, after {{a fire in}} March 1976, Amtrak {{undertook}} a $314,000 rehabilitation of the station. The roof and portico were rebuilt, {{two of the three}} dormers removed, new restrooms added, and the platform and <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> repaired. The loggia, windows, and other openings were covered with cinderblocks and brick.|$|E

50|$|Limbach (Vogtl) halt (until 30 June 1911, Bahnhof Limbach i. V) {{was opened}} in1902. Apart from two platforms, two <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> {{and an open}} entranceway, {{there were no other}} facilities. The <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> have now been {{replaced}} by glass shelters.|$|R
50|$|Both island {{platforms}} have indoor <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> {{that were}} refurbished in May 2012 {{as part of}} a wider scheme to refurbish and add <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> across the Great Northern Route, and there is also outdoor seating {{along the length of the}} platforms.|$|R
5|$|The Scelsi ITC houses BRTA offices, a <b>waiting</b> <b>room,</b> {{concession}} vendors, {{and other}} office tenants. The {{second floor of}} the building houses two classrooms used by Berkshire Community College and Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts. On May 19, 2013, the Pittsfield Visitor's Center moved into {{the first floor of the}} ITC, to be staffed by local volunteers.|$|E
5|$|The bla ma’s {{residence}} {{which was}} inhabited by Sgrub khang bla also still exists {{and consists of}} two rooms with a central <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> between them. There is also Sgrub khang pa's meditation hut, a small protector deity chapel, a Dharma enclosure (chos rwa), a ruined kitchen and various smaller huts, which are used mostly for storage today.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground was}} lowered by a full {{story on the}} south and east sides of the station, exposing what had {{formerly}} been the basement to improve access for taxis and private automobiles. A marquee to shelter arriving and departing passengers spanned the seven central bays of the lower level, with a more ornate version on {{the north end of the}} pedestrian tunnel. The lower <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> was expanded, a ticket office constructed, and a larger staircase to the main <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> was built. The floor was covered with terrazzo and green marble, with white marble wainscoting on the walls. Three bays were added to the west wing for additional functional space, removing direct track access from the ramp. Cast iron streetlights with the PRR Keystone motif in their base were located around the driveway and grounds.|$|E
50|$|The dormers were {{to allow}} natural light to {{penetrate}} the <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms.</b> <b>Waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> were designed with exposed red brick walls, with several courses of dark brick to unify the large interior spaces horizontally. The interior features a wooden ceiling with massive timber roof trusses.|$|R

5|$|A {{glass screen}} {{separated}} {{the first class}} platform and circulating area from the platform and circulating area for third class passengers. The third class section was entered from the secondary entrance in Newnham Terrace, and was more sparsely furnished and not equipped with lifts. From the Newnham Terrace entrance a staircase led to a single communal <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> on the first floor, and to the third class platform on the second floor, much shorter than the first class platform.|$|E
5|$|A new {{station was}} built in 1897, {{slightly}} to the southeast, behind the Lovell Block. In 1927, the Fitchburg Cutoff became freight-only between the Alewife area and Somerville Junction. Passenger trains from the Lexington Branch and the Central Massachusetts Railroad were diverted to the Fitchburg mainline and began to stop at Cambridge station. In 1937, the Boston and Maine Railroad built a two-story brick depot by the bridge, with the ticket office at street level and the <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> and platforms below.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{work began}} on a {{complete}} redevelopment {{of the station}} building. It opened on 1 July 2001, and featured lifts and generally enhanced facilities. Local roads were enhanced to help speed passengers' journeys {{to and from the}} station, and a new multi-storey car park was built to replace the spaces lost to the Royal Mail facility. A dedicated bus interchange was opened in 2003. In 2006, construction started on a new platform face {{on the north side of}} platform 1, to ease congestion for trains toward Birmingham and London. The new platform, platform 4, was opened on 9 May 2007 by rail minister Tom Harris MP. As part of the reconstruction, the <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> at the east end of platform 1 was demolished, and replaced with an extended waiting area and customer help desk. Platform 1 was subsequently redesignated platform 3. The work cost £3,000,000, and was funded by Network Rail, with First Great Western contributing £100,000 towards the new <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> and help desk.|$|E

5|$|The Bristol and Exeter Railway opened Cullompton {{railway station}} when the railway opened on 1 May 1844. Around 1931 {{the lines were}} widened to provide two passing loops and a new goods shed and <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> were constructed. It closed to {{passengers}} on 5 October 1964, the site now being used for the M5 motorway Cullompton services. The nearest railway station is now Tiverton Parkway open by British Rail.|$|E
5|$|The new building, also {{designed}} by Cyril Bazett Tubbs, {{was designed for}} attractiveness and modernity to contrast with the traditional gloomy decor associated with the funeral industry. A narrow four-storey office building stood at 188 Westminster Bridge Road. The ground floor was taken up by a large arch leading to a <b>waiting</b> <b>room,</b> an office for general enquiries, and the long driveway leading to the station itself; above this were the LNC's offices and boardrooms.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, Giffnock had no church buildings, and {{religious}} meetings took place in the <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> of Giffnock Railway Station and, later, in the clubhouse at Eastwood Golf Course. Orchardhill Parish Church, designed by HE Clifford and completed in 1899, was the first church built within Giffnock. Now a category B listed building, the Church is built in a Gothic revival style of architecture and is built mainly of locally quarried stone.|$|E

5|$|When {{service from}} Union Station was inaugurated in 1928, both {{eastbound}} and westbound trains were departing the station almost every hour bound for destinations across the United States. Passengers in the station's expansive <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> could patronize its news stand, telegraph office, barber shop, shoeshine stand, or its lunch counter and soda fountain. Train schedules were handwritten {{on a large}} blackboard, while station staff announced the arrival and impending departures of the trains by megaphone.|$|E
5|$|As constructed, {{the main}} {{facade of the}} station faced Glenwood Avenue. The two-story {{entrance}} loggia consisted of seven arched bays, with a three-bay wing to the northeast and a two-bay wing to the southwest, and acted as a transition point between {{the street and the}} station interior. The first floor (at track level) featured a large <b>waiting</b> <b>room</b> occupying the entire center block, with vault lights providing natural illumination and a fountain set into the western wall. Restrooms, a kitchen, and a cafe occupied the wings.|$|E
5|$|Following the takeover, a new {{stationmaster}}'s {{house was}} built at Sea Mills, {{at a cost of}} £240. The stationmaster is recorded as having kept a variety of farm animals and sold eggs to passengers. Increased levels of traffic saw the line through Sea Mills doubled in the early 1900s, and the opportunity was taken to rebuild the station. A second platform opened on 6 January 1907 {{to the west of the}} tracks to serve northbound trains. The original platform now exclusively served southbound trains, and was lengthened to , the same length as the new platform. A station building was constructed on the original platform in a domestic style, with an arched terracotta entrance, spar-covered walls and a high-pitched tiled roof. The building contained a booking hall, booking office, toilets and a ladies' <b>waiting</b> <b>room.</b> A smaller building on the northbound platform contained a general <b>waiting</b> <b>room.</b> The subway under the bridge over the River Trym was also built at this time, with the porter's job being expanded to include washing the rubbish out of the subway after high tide, for which the railway provided a hosepipe and Wellington boots. By 1910 there were 17 trains from Bristol to Avonmouth and 15 back, increasing to 21 and 19 respectively by 1920, though not all stopped at Sea Mills. The station was completely closed on Sundays.|$|E
5000|$|The two <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> are {{original}} Great Western Railway [...] "pagoda" [...] shelters. The ticket office, at {{road level}} on the down side, {{was also a}} pagoda building. Both <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> and the original ticket office have been listed buildings since 27 November 1992, to prevent their replacement by the bus shelter type structures then being installed at other stations on the line. The ticket office was damaged by fire in 2005 and demolished early in 2007. It was replaced with a near replica in 2007, but unlike the original the new building has no clerk's window. The <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> have recently been repainted to match the ticket office.|$|R

50|$|Panelling in {{the office}} {{consisted}} of North Carolina pine and ash, the latter also used to panel the <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> {{at either end of}} the station. Hardwood floors were installed throughout the building. The <b>waiting</b> <b>rooms</b> were originally segregated, with a smoking room for men and a non-smoking room for women. These were later transformed for local and express trains.|$|R
