50|$|Boxy an Star is {{the first}} novel by English author Daren King. It was shortlisted for the 1999 Guardian First Book Award and longlisted for the Booker Prize. The book is notable for its unusual futuristic vernacular style, {{reminiscent}} of <b>works</b> such <b>as</b> <b>A</b> <b>Clockwork</b> Orange or The Book of Dave.|$|R
40|$|Peter Carey’s recent novel {{shares the}} concern with ‘unoriginality’ {{which has become}} a {{hallmark}} of his later fiction. It can actually be argued that, through this new variation on a known theme, he purports to move beyond the clichéd postmodern paradox that authenticities – whether psychological or aesthetic – are always essentially made up, in order to consider the matter from another angle, pondering the perilous moment when an overtly fabricated object somehow mysteriously springs to life. If, as the title suggests, even our most personal emotions can be rationalized in terms of chemical reactions, why then could we not pursue a reverse path of investigation and envisage material reality as the source providing the components for the creation of spirit? This is the subjective context in which the protagonist Catherine, who <b>works</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> horologist (<b>clockwork</b> expert) in <b>a</b> London museum, must reconstruct a nineteenth-century mechanical swan suspected by some to be harbouring the soul of its original maker. Interestingly Catherine, herself a die-hard rationalist, finds herself shaken by a devastating bereavement which makes her unusually open to any form of consolation – including the self-indulgence of nostalgia, but also of cocaine and alcohol – which is why she will whole-heartedly embrace the welcome distraction offered by her work of mechanical reconstruction. As part of her attempt to understand the structure of the automaton, she feels that she must immerse herself in the diaries left behind by the commissioner of the work, an Englishman named Henry Brandling animated by his faith that the elaborate toy may release enough energy in his consumptive son, Percy, to save him from his otherwise lethal condition. Thus Carey creates an opening into the rationalist fabric of his protagonist’s present, allowing her to entertain anachronistic fantasies about the life-saving (let alone life-giving) properties of true art. Inasmuch as Catherine’s perusal of the diaries eventually facilitates a circuitous confrontation of her own grief, so that her excursions into the past serve to shore up her fragile sense of a future, the text appears to vindicate its own fantastic claims about the demiurgic, or at least redemptive, powers of art. Perhaps predictably, some reviewers balked {{in the face of this}} species of self-promotion, repeating the oft-expressed view that Carey’s fiction, in view of its deliberate straining of the laws of credibility, finally fails to emerge from an enmeshment in its own favoured themes of forgery and imitative inadequacy. The ultimate question asked by the work is then whether it must be seen to be equal to its own promise of transcendence. The present paper, by way of its own descent into the past (and particularly through a comparison with My Life <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Fake which rehearses similar themes), will try to provide an answer, notably by circumscribing the intention of a text in which metafiction assumes a metaphysical dimension possibly unique in Carey’s corpus.

[...] Although this was written after the {{publication}} of the book <b>A</b> <b>Clockwork</b> Orange by Anthony Burgess (1962), it is unlikely that Garner intended a reference to the novel, more likely that he was using a common colloquialism. There is some dispute whether the expression originated with the Burgess book or otherwise, and Garner's use suggests otherwise.|$|R

50|$|The {{political}} and religious views of film director Stanley Kubrick (1928-1999) have been subjects of speculation during his lifetime and after his death. While earlier films like Paths of Glory (1957) seem to reflect an overtly progressive ideology, later films such <b>as</b> <b>A</b> <b>Clockwork</b> Orange (1971) can be construed as equally critical of the political left and right. Despite the lack of commitment to a particular world-view, it is generally agreed that Kubrick {{was fascinated by the}} possibilities of <b>a</b> supernatural reality, <b>as</b> reflected in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and The Shining (1980).|$|R
5000|$|Peter Ruppert {{noted that}} Hoban's novel draws on [...] "such {{well-known}} dystopias <b>as</b> <b>A</b> <b>Clockwork</b> Orange, Lord of the Flies, and A Canticle for Leibowitz", and [...] "what {{is unique in}} Hoban's haunting {{vision of the future}} is his language" [...] which is described as being similar to the Nadsat slang spoken in Anthony Burgess' <b>A</b> <b>Clockwork</b> Orange. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists stated that, [...] "The force and beauty and awfulness of Hoban's creation is shattering," [...] and praised the author's use of a crude [...] "Chaucerian English". John Mullan of The Guardian also praised Hoban's decision to narrate the novel in a devolved form of English: [...] "The struggle with Riddley's language is what makes reading the book so absorbing, so completely possessing." ...|$|R
2500|$|He had overheard {{the phrase}} [...] "as queer <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>clockwork</b> orange" [...] in a London pub in 1945 and {{assumed it was}} a Cockney expression. In <b>Clockwork</b> Marmalade, <b>an</b> essay {{published}} in the Listener in 1972, {{he said that he}} had heard the phrase several times since that occasion. He also explained the title in response to a question from William Everson on the television programme Camera Three in 1972, [...] "Well, the title has a very different meaning but only to a particular generation of London Cockneys. It's a phrase which I heard many years ago and so fell in love with, I wanted to use it, the title of the book. But the phrase itself I did not make up. The phrase [...] "as queer <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>clockwork</b> orange" [...] is good old East London slang and it didn't seem to me necessary to explain it. Now, obviously, I have to give it an extra meaning. I've implied an extra dimension. I've implied the junction of the organic, the lively, the sweet – in other words, life, the orange – and the mechanical, the cold, the disciplined. I've brought them together in this kind of oxymoron, this sour-sweet word." [...] Nonetheless, no other record of the expression being used before 1962 has ever appeared. Kingsley Amis notes in his Memoirs (1991) that no trace of it appears in Eric Partridge's Dictionary of Historical Slang.|$|R

Commonly, such radios are designed to use minimal battery power, and a common feature (especially on units sold in less-developed countries where electrical supplies may be unreliable or nonexistent) is a hand-cranked electrical generator along with a rechargeable battery to store the generated energy (the device is sometimes known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>clockwork</b> radio). <b>A</b> few, such <b>as</b> the Blackout Buddy from Eton Corporation, and the Adventurer from Ambient Weather are designed to recharge from wall current.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{directors}} shocked audiences with violent films such <b>as</b> <b>A</b> <b>Clockwork</b> Orange (1971), Stanley Kubrick's brutal exploration of futuristic youth gangs, and Last Tango in Paris (1972), Bernardo Bertolucci's taboo-breaking, sexually-explicit and controversial film. Nevertheless, other directors did more introspective films, such as Andrei Tarkovsky's meditative science fiction film Solaris (1972), supposedly intended <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Soviet riposte to 2001. In 1975 and 1979 respectedly, Tarkovsky directed another two films which garnered critical acclaim overseas, The Mirror and Stalker. Terrence Malick, who directed Badlands (1973) and Days of Heaven (1978) shared many traits with Tarkovsky, {{such as his}} long, lingering shots of natural beauty, evocative imagery, and poetic narrative style.|$|R

5|$|Between 1905 and 1981 the Albert Bridge {{was painted}} uniformly green; in 1981 it was repainted yellow. In 1992 it was redecorated and rewired. Partially <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result, {{it is now}} a major West London landmark. The bridge is painted in pink, blue and green to {{increase}} visibility in fog and murky light and thus to reduce the risks of ships colliding with the fragile structure during the day. At night, a network of 4,000 low-voltage tungsten-halogen bulbs illuminate the bridge. In 1993 the innovative use of long-life low-energy lighting was commended by Mary Archer, at the time Chairwoman of the National Energy Foundation.

[...] Dunnett reveals only gradually, with tantalizing hints and small details, Lymond's motives and his true relationships with the other characters. Lymond leaves no one indifferent to him: {{some of the key}} characters—such as Richard Crawford, third Baron Culter and Lymond's older brother, and Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox—are one-time friends or intimates who become his mortal enemies. Betrayals and double-crosses, both potential and actual, abound. The pieces of the mystery only fit together late in the story <b>as</b> revelations at <b>a</b> trial.|$|R

The music, including The Devil Is In The Beats and The Devil Is In The Details, underscores the movie's style, recalling Stanley Kubrick's <b>A</b> <b>Clockwork</b> Orange with musical motifs consistent with Wright's [...] "fairy tale theme" [...] of childhood innocence confronting the modern [...] "synthetic" [...] world. Several reviewers have commented that the movie has a hyper-stylized Kubrickian tone, reminiscent of <b>A</b> <b>Clockwork</b> Orange. The [...] "Kubrick-esque" [...] style includes Isaacs' [...] "gleeful sadism... at times darkly comedic," [...] a whistling villain reminiscent of Alex DeLarge.

50|$|The visual {{style of}} science fiction film can be {{characterized}} by a clash between alien and familiar images. This clash is implemented when alien images become familiar, <b>as</b> in <b>A</b> <b>Clockwork</b> Orange, when the repetitions of the Korova Milkbar make the alien decor seem more familiar. As well, familiar images become alien, as in the films Repo Man and Liquid Sky. For example, in Dr. Strangelove, the, distortion of the humans make the familiar images seem more alien. Finally, alien and familiar images are juxtaposed, as in The Deadly Mantis, when a giant praying mantis is shown climbing the Washington Monument.|$|R
