5|$|General {{relativity}} {{predicts that}} the path of light <b>will</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> curvature of spacetime as it passes near a star. This effect was initially confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun.|$|E

5|$|The {{player is}} usually {{accompanied}} {{by one or}} more friendly non-player characters, who <b>will</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> player and provide assistance in combat against enemies. As they are often key to the story, friendly characters must not be killed in combat except during scripted events. In between combat missions, the player can move around the USS Voyager and interact with other members of its crew, often performing non-combat tasks to progress the story.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{uniformity}} {{through different}} LARP games, {{although they may}} have similar styles, no one LARP <b>will</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> exact same rules and regulations. Each individual game will provide a specific rule set located in the LARP's handbook. There are many variations of combat in LARPs, however, they fall under archetypes.|$|E
5|$|High {{reveals that}} two humans, Líf and Lífþrasir, will have also survived the {{destruction}} by {{hiding in the}} wood Hoddmímis holt. These two survivors consume the morning dew for sustenance, and from their descendants {{the world will be}} repopulated. Vafþrúðnismál stanza 45 is then quoted. The personified sun, Sól, will have a daughter at least as beautiful as she, and this daughter <b>will</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> same path as her mother. Vafþrúðnismál stanza 47 is quoted, and so ends the foretelling of Ragnarök in Gylfaginning.|$|E

5|$|Influenced by {{concerns}} about overpopulation, the counterculture of the 1960s and the societal effects of television, the play depicts {{a world of}} the future where a small elite control the media, keeping the lower classes docile by serving them an endless diet of lowest common denominator programmes and pornography. The play concentrates on an idea the programme controllers have for a new programme which <b>will</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> trials and tribulations {{of a group of}} people left to fend for themselves on a remote island. In this respect, the play is often cited as having anticipated the craze for reality television.|$|E
5|$|The South Mountain Freeway, {{presently}} under construction, is a southerly bypass of Downtown Phoenix {{which will}} {{run along the}} southern edge of the Ahwatukee neighborhood of Phoenix and pass just to the south and west of South Mountain Park. It begins at the already complete traffic interchange of the Santan Freeway and Interstate 10. Heading west along the Pecos Road alignment through Ahwatukee, the freeway straddles the border with the Gila River Indian Reservation. Turning northwest and eventually north, the freeway <b>will</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> 59th and 55th Avenue alignments north to its terminus with Interstate 10 in west Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|The female incubates for 12–14 {{days before}} the altricial chicks are hatched naked and blind. Fledging takes another 10–19 (average 13.6) days, with both parents feeding the young and {{removing}} faecal sacs. The nest is often ill-concealed {{compared with those of}} other species, and many breeding attempts fail due to predation. The young are fed by the parents for up to three weeks after leaving the nest, and <b>will</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> adults begging for food. If the female starts another nest, the male alone will feed the fledged young. Second broods are common, with the female reusing the same nest if the brood was successful, and three broods may be raised in the south of the common blackbird's range.|$|E
50|$|However, Jones discovers {{this and}} punishes Bootstrap by forcing him watch the Kraken destroy the Edinburgh Trader, the ship which is {{harbouring}} <b>Will.</b> <b>Following</b> <b>the</b> devastation, Jones orders Bootstrap {{locked in the}} brig. Bootstrap, however, remains unaware that Will survived, and is too devastated to resist his imprisonment.|$|R

5|$|The game {{begins as}} Eric Harris' mother wakes him on April 20, 1999. Harris phones Dylan Klebold, and the pair meet in Harris' {{basement}} to plot {{a series of}} bombings that will precede their planned shooting. The two reminisce about the bullying they experienced at Columbine High and express rage at those they perceive to be their tormentors. Harris and Klebold make a video, apologizing to their parents and asking them not to blame themselves for what <b>will</b> <b>follow.</b> <b>The</b> two boys collect their guns and bombs, pack a duffel bag with weapons, and leave home.|$|E
5|$|The tape at {{the start}} line was made more sturdy, {{consisting}} of three strands instead of one, and in a more distinctive pattern; {{the width of the}} start was also reduced. If a false start is called, two officials (in contact with the starter by radio) will wave fluorescent yellow flags at jockeys. Further up the course, a third official will be positioned so as to arrest those who fail to notice the two initial flags. If necessary, the third official <b>will</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> field in a car to stop them.|$|E
5|$|H-13/FFH-13 crosses east into Schoolcraft County {{completely}} and {{provides access to}} the Pete's Lake National Forest Campground near the lake of the same name. The road shifts back westerly to follow the county line near the Widewaters National Forest Campground; from here north the forest highway <b>will</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> county line north to the northwestern corner of Schoolcraft County. Along the way, H-13 meets the southern terminus of the unsigned H-09. Once the road crosses back into Alger County completely, it provides access to Wagner Falls State Park and passes Hanley Field, a private airport south of Wetmore. The forest highway crosses another branch of the Canadian National Railway south of the junction with M-28/M-94 in Wetmore. At that junction, the FFH-13 designation ends and H-13 continues north as a gravel surface along Connors Road through Munising Township. The county road ends at the intersection with H-58 (Munising–Van Meer–Shingleton Road) in the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore. As a county-designated highway, H-13 is maintained by the county road commissions of Delta, Alger and Schoolcraft counties (DCRC, ACRC and SCRC respectively) with support for the FFH-13 segment {{as part of the}} Forest Highway System that is funded and administered by the United States Forest Service and the Federal Highway Administration. H-13/FFH-13 forms a major north–south artery for the Hiawatha National Forest.|$|E

5|$|While the Silver Line was {{originally}} planned to terminate at Stadium-Armory, in 2012 {{the plan was}} changed for the line to end at Largo Town Center instead, because Stadium-Armory's pocket track is too short for trains to turn around. It follows the Blue and Orange Line tracks through DC, continuing through Arlington along the Orange Line and branching off immediately east of the West Falls Church station. The new tracks run in the median of the Dulles Connector Road to an elevated bridge, which takes them over Virginia Route 123. Two elevated stops along {{the west side of}} Route 123 serve the national headquarters of CapitalOne, SAIC and two enclosed Tysons Corner shopping malls. The tracks then enter a tunnel which emerges in the median of Virginia Route 7. Two elevated stations above Route 7 serve the western section of Tysons Corner. The elevated track then swings into the median of the Dulles Access Road until it reaches the airport. Along the way, five new stations would be built with platforms in the median of the access road and a faregate and pedestrian bridges to parking areas elevated above the highway. In anticipation of the Herndon station being built, in 1999 Fairfax County constructed a 1,750-space parking garage with ramps to the Dulles Access Road toll lanes and this facility is being used for bus commuters on an interim basis. The garage has drawn criticism because of alleged construction flaws. As originally planned, upon reaching the airport the track will enter a tunnel which <b>will</b> <b>follow</b> <b>the</b> path of the arrivals driveway of the airport terminal to a station located close to the terminal. The track would leave the tunnel near the airport hotel and economy parking lots and would head north parallel to the main runways. A storage yard and maintenance facility would branch off to the west occupying the airport's buffer zone north of the end of its major runways. The final two stops would be in the median of the Dulles Greenway, serving the Ashburn suburb. Hence, the line is expected to draw both airport traffic and commuters from the far western suburbs of Washington, DC. Buses currently provide these users with limited public transportation. In contrast, the Silver Line is expected to provide trains once every six minutes during rush hours and once every fourteen minutes during non-rush hours.|$|E
