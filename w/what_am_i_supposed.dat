2500|$|On September 15, 1999 at 9:50p.m., Minsky {{was arrested}} at Tampa International Airport by airport police officers. Minsky {{attempted}} to scam another woman the previous day by asking her to bring $5,000 to the airport. His bail was set at $1 million and he was extradited to California. During an interview with America's Most Wanted, Minsky, {{when asked if he}} had any remorse for his crimes, stated, [...] "Of course I do now that I'm caught, but <b>what</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to do; I'm a parolee. Work for $10 an hour?" [...] At Minsky's trial the segment containing his statement was played for the jury, sealing his fate.|$|E
2500|$|At Kentucky, Earnhardt Jr. {{struggled}} with overheated brakes, and even caused a caution when he brushed the outside wall in turns 3 and 4 {{halfway through the}} race. Later, on lap 206, {{he would be the}} subject of controversy when he rear-ended Danica Patrick and spun her out, in part because of his faulty brakes. Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, <b>what</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I know better than to run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't nothing I could do. I mean, as hard as I hit her, what the hell did she think I was doing? Trying to wreck her? We ain't got no problem. It's not like we were having a problem out on the racetrack with her. It's not like I just drew her name out of a hat and decided she was the one I was going to run into tonight." ...|$|E

5000|$|Following the 1968 Soviet {{occupation}} of Czechoslovakia, private property was nationalized. In 1972, Tichý was evicted from his studio, his work {{thrown into the}} street. He stopped drawing and painting and concentrated only on photography, working in the disorderly conditions of his home. Of the transition, he says, [...] "The paintings were already painted, the drawings drawn. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to do? <b>I</b> looked for new media. With the help of photography I saw everything in a new light. It was a new world." ...|$|R
5000|$|Commenting on {{the event}} afterwards, Blake stated, [...] "I wasn't {{trying to do}} {{anything}} to that Parks woman except do my job. She was in violation of the city codes, so <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to do? That damn bus was full and she wouldn't move back. I had my orders. I had police powers—any driver for the city did. So the bus filled up and a white man got on, and she had his seat and I told her to move back, and she wouldn't do it." ...|$|R

Quirk the difficulty she was having with Davis because of the Oscar incident but added, [...] "She acted like Baby Jane was a one-woman show after they nominated her. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to do, let her hog all the glory, act like <b>I</b> hadn't even <b>been</b> in the movie?

5000|$|In 2003, Little Fish, an uncharacteristically cheerful one-act musical for LaChiusa, {{based on}} two short stories by Deborah Eisenberg, premiered Off-Broadway.

He would give local sprinters a ten- or twenty-yard start and beat them in the 100-yd (91-m) dash. He also challenged and defeated racehorses; as he revealed later, the trick was to race a high-strung thoroughbred that would be frightened by the starter's shotgun and give him a bad jump. Owens said, [...] "People say that it was degrading for an Olympic champion to run against a horse, but <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to do? <b>I</b> had four gold medals, but you can't eat four gold medals."

I do not remember having seen any reviews of Professor Riickert's edition of 2 Samuel in British periodicals. I know of only one copy of it in a library in Cambridge, and that is in Tyndale House.

[...] During the song, Timberlake sings, [...] "It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie/ Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy/ Can't fight, knocked down, then I got over you/ Can't fight no more, you knock me out/ <b>What</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to do?."

[...] Eli's god answers his {{questions}} when the powers in heaven send an angelic Callisto to Eli in a vision. In the vision she tells Eli that he must use his powers to bring Xena and Gabrielle back from the dead. He begins praying to his god for help, and Callisto comes to aid him in resurrecting Xena and Gabrielle.|$|E

Despite receiving no complaints from the public {{at the time of}} the protest, West Midlands Police decided to ask McGowan to move along for his own safety on the second day. He was defiant and returned until the 20 November. Talking to BBC News, McGowan explained: [...] "The role of a soldier in war is to be used as a weapon and my role as the artist is being a witness to our time. <b>What</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to paint, pictures about nice things?

5000|$|Many of Deary's books {{make very}} serious points, {{underneath}} all the jokes and gore. He often comments {{on whether the}} modern era is as vile as previous eras, and questions the reader's morals and patriotism. Deary explains [...] "I'd basically concluded British Empire {{was one of the}} worst things to happen to the planet. So I deployed the facts that illustrate that". The Guardian explains [...] "The last chapter of Ruthless Romans portrays modern-day Zimbabwe and essentially asks, is this any different?". The musical stage show Barmy Britain, co-written by Deary, [...] "features a finale whose sarcastic references to burger bars, bankers and internet dating leave its young audience in little doubt that whatever the crazed excesses of our ancestors, future generations will doubtless consider us every bit as loopy". When informed by a Jewish mother that her Rabbi told her not to introduce her children to the Holocaust before 13 years old, and that her 6-year-old had read it in Horrible Histories, Deary replied: [...] "Sorry, but <b>what</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to do - lie to children?".|$|E
500|$|Mega Man 6 was {{developed}} {{at the same time}} as the franchise's first spin-off, Mega Man X for Nintendo's newer console, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Series artist Keiji Inafune, credited as [...] "Inafking", stated that having a video game franchise with six titles is very rare, and one of the advantages to this is that players expect certain aspects of each game to be repeated in the next. After having implemented so many different mechanics to the gameplay of past entries, Inafune thought that Rush adaptor assembly was inevitable. The artist struggled with the adaptor designs and ultimately found them to be unrealistic. According to Inafune, [...] "If you think about it, they shouldn't be able to combine like this. It would be awkward if parts of Rush like his neck were left over after they combined, so <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> to do?" ...|$|R

[...] He and former teammate Gabe Gross have talked about how they organize Bible studies with their teammates. St. Pete Times writer Mark Topkin wrote that Zobrist does this with his teammates, saying Zobrist [...] "doesn't judge or proselytize, refraining from forcing his beliefs on anyone, though willing to get involved if asked." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to the memoir, Pearson {{says her}} life was turned around upon {{learning}} in prison that a close friend and drug dealer, whom she called [...] "Uncle", was killed. Pearson said of her decision to write her book, [...] "I just want {{to let people know}} where I came from ... to share my story. I know the Lord has blessed me. He gave me the power just to tell this story." [...] The book also depicts the difficulty with which Pearson attempts to adjust to life after prison; she is fired from two jobs due to her criminal background, which drives her to return temporarily to drug dealing. During an interview about the book, she said, [...] "Every time I turned around, they kept firing me, so where else could I turn to? The streets never let you down.
