500|$|Shaw was one {{of three}} {{children}} born to Dr. Geoffrey Shaw, the music master at Gresham's School, a Norfolk independent boarding school, where Shaw began his education. His uncle, Martin Shaw, was a composer of church music, and his family's love of music heavily influenced Shaw's career path. Shaw made his acting debut at age eight on the London stage as one of the juvenile band in The Cockyolly Bird at the Royal Court Theatre in Chelsea on New Year's Day of 1914. During his time at Gresham's, he also played Petruchio in The Taming of the Shrew, his first of many performances from the works of William Shakespeare; schoolmate W. H. Auden, who would go on to become a highly regarded poet, portrayed Katherina in the play opposite him. After Gresham's, Shaw planned to become a painter and spent two years at the Slade School of Fine Art before switching his interests to acting; regarding the change, his father informed him, [...] "I wondered <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> come to your senses." [...] He earned a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in Bloomsbury, London. Actor Charles Laughton enrolled in the Academy {{at the same time as}} Shaw, who later said his first impression of Laughton was [...] "a poor fat boy". Although Shaw and his fellow students initially felt pity for Laughton, they were quickly impressed with his talent.|$|E

Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.' ...|$|E
2500|$|In April Fischer {{notified}} Goddard {{that the}} Navy {{wanted to do}} all its rocket work at the Engineering Experiment Station at Annapolis. Esther, worried that a move to the climate of Maryland would cause Robert's health to deteriorate faster, objected. But the patriotic Goddard replied, [...] "Esther, don't you know there's a war on?" [...] Fischer also questioned the move, as Goddard could work just as well in Roswell. Goddard simply answered, [...] "I was wondering <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> ask me." [...] Fischer had wanted to offer him something bigger—a long range missile—but JATO {{was all he could}} manage, hoping for a greater project later. It was a case of a square peg in a round hole, according to a disappointed Goddard.|$|E

6000|$|... "I said, 'Are {{you ever}} busy in this shop? Does there ever {{come a time}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> feel <b>you</b> <b>would</b> like to get your work done, instead of {{lingering}} over it and spinning it out for pure love of the thing?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You surely can't be Wally Mason!" [...] "I was {{wondering}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> remember." [...] "But the programme called you something else--John something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Miss Bessie,' he said, laughing, 'Jane {{said the}} gentleman was very urgent in {{wanting to know}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be in. An offer, eh?' ...|$|E
60|$|Gons. I {{could say}} {{something}} in my own defence; But it were half a crime to plead my cause, <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have me guilty.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wonder, I do, at your {{making such}} ungrateful speeches,' sobbed Dora. 'When {{you know that}} the other day, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> said <b>you</b> <b>would</b> like a little bit of fish, I went out myself, miles and miles, and ordered it, to {{surprise}} you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you forgive}} me, Grizel? I {{have always had}} a dread that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{recovered}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> cease to care for me." [...] He knew that this would please her if she was the real Grizel, and he was so anxious to make her happy for evermore.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don’t say {{any more}} about it," [...] she pleaded. [...] "I have no doubt you are right. Only <b>when</b> <b>you</b> said <b>you</b> <b>would</b> do {{anything}} for us I—I thought you meant it. I see how uncomfortable it might be for you. I ought to have thought of that before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think there}} was a time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not have let that stand in the way, but men are seldom very constant, are they?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Wer. [...] You'll {{find the}} spring more obvious [...] On the other side; and, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> return, [...] It yields to the least touch.|$|E

6000|$|... "I can't {{believe that}} you have thought of me so much as I have thought of you," [...] said Philip, timidly. [...] "Do <b>you</b> know, <b>when</b> I was away, I made {{a picture of you}} as you looked that morning in the study <b>when</b> <b>you</b> said <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not forget me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{have sent}} for me, Peter--I beg pardon. I was so glad <b>when</b> <b>you</b> sent. I <b>would</b> have come before, only I {{was afraid that}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be annoyed. Is there {{anything}} {{that we can do}} for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, my man of affairs, join us a hand!" [...] {{says the}} doctor to me. [...] "I have known the time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> sit from noon until supper." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] said Roberta, [...] "would {{it not be}} {{more fair}} and generous {{for you to go}} away now, and {{postpone}} this proposal until some time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> each have an equal chance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like that}} question," [...] he said; [...] "it tells me {{we are as}} good friends again as ever. The fact is, {{the sight of the}} congregation, when I get into the pulpit, has the same effect upon me that the sight of the footlights has on an actor. All oratory (though my {{clerical}} brethren are shy of confessing it) is acting--without the scenery and the costumes. Did you really mean it, last night, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> said <b>you</b> <b>would</b> like to hear me preach?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} you will," [...] Wilson said warmly; [...] "and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do I <b>would</b> back <b>you</b> at long odds against any of us. Ah, they are beginning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I {{watched the}} flowers; and the dingle-bells and cowslips and cockle-shells are all {{withered}} and faded away. And {{did you not}} say that, God willing, <b>when</b> this happened <b>you</b> <b>would</b> come back to us?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I was {{wondering}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> come out," [...] said Heyst, still {{without looking at}} the girl--to whom, after several experimental essays in combining detached letters and loose syllables, he had given the name of Lena.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Here {{has been}} little Mrs. Ferrari, my dear, in a dreadful state of mind, inquiring <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be back. Her husband has left Lord Montbarry, without a word of warning--and nobody knows what has become of him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will see}} to that, your honour. I {{have no doubt}} that I can find such a man without difficulty. <b>When</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> want him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All things considered, I {{had better}} decline {{answering}} that question, Lady Dedlock. If I {{were to say}} I don't know <b>when,</b> exactly, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not believe me, and it would answer no purpose. It may be to-morrow. I would rather say no more. You are prepared, and I hold out no expectations which circumstances might fail to justify. I wish you good evening." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Portable: The Hoover Portable was {{launched}} by Hoover in 1963. It is a [...] "Suitcase" [...] type canister {{that did not}} have wheels; <b>you</b> <b>would</b> tug it around with you as <b>you</b> clean. <b>When</b> finished, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> store the hose, attachments, and power cord inside the machine. In 1969, Hoover added wheels to the Portable. The Portable was manufactured until 1978. Also, it used the same motor as the Hoover Dial-A-Matic, the first clean-air upright.|$|R
6000|$|Bonnet {{looked at}} him much pleased. [...] "I told you so, my good Ben. I knew that the time would come <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{acknowledge}} that I am a true pirate; after this, you cannot doubt it any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pardon me,' {{returned}} Mrs Wilfer. 'Not at all. Two of my daughters. R. W., this is {{the gentleman}} who has taken your first-floor. He was so good as {{to make an appointment}} for to-night, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be at home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{he paused}} a moment. [...] "I did so long," [...] he said, [...] "to walk round the old place {{with you the}} other day before these people came there, and I was so {{disappointed}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not come with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I {{am sorry}} {{you have this}} bustle, and so many to entertain, <b>when</b> I know <b>you</b> <b>would</b> rather have the {{peaceful}} feelings belonging to the day undisturbed. I should like to shelter you up here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I guess I {{could go}} up to the Armenian with <b>you,</b> perhaps. <b>When</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> like to go? You know I've always got lots of dates but I--um--let's see, I think I could go to-morrow evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God bless you," [...] the {{starosta}} {{said with}} tears in his eyes. [...] "I shall not come near <b>you</b> again; they <b>would</b> see that something was strange with me, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were missing, <b>would</b> guess that I knew you were going.
