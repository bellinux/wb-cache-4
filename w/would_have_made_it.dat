5|$|The {{large size}} and weight would have {{rendered}} the tank unable to cross bridges {{at the risk of}} collapsing them, and travelling on roads would soon destroy them. Though its top intended speed was 40kilometres per hour, its huge size and high visibility <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> extremely vulnerable to aerial bombardment and artillery fire. Its great size would also have made it nearly impossible to transport—no existing railway or train car could bear its weight and its width was too great for existing tunnels.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Capelle, {{the deputy}} {{director}} of the Reichsmarineamt, stated that by mid November 1906, the testing for the underwater protection designs would be complete. He suggested that if the torpedo bulkhead needed to be strengthened, the ship might be too heavy for the 28cm(11in) guns, if the displacement of around 19,000t(21,000short tons) was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider using smaller guns, even if it meant increasing the displacement of the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a secondary battery of 17cm(6.7in) guns instead of the 15cm(5.9in) the design called for, but the increased weight <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> impossible to mount eight main battery guns.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston {{may have}} simply been {{friends with a}} close working relationship. Contemporary chronicler {{comments}} are vaguely worded; Orleton's allegations were {{at least in part}} politically motivated, and are very similar to the highly politicised sodomy allegations made against Pope Boniface VIII and the Knights Templar in 1303 and 1308 respectively. Later accounts by chroniclers of Edward's activities may trace back to Orleton's original allegations, and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward's reign. Such historians as Michael Prestwich and Seymour Phillips have argued that the public nature of the English royal court <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet; neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse comments about Edward's sexual behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Fitzgerald had {{no system}} {{to monitor the}} {{presence}} or amount of water in her cargo hold, {{even though there was}} always some present. The intensity of the November 10 storm <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> difficult, if not impossible, to access the hatches from the spar deck. The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water {{reached the top of the}} taconite cargo. The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been impossible to pump water from the hold when it was filled with bulk cargo. The Marine Board noted that because Fitzgerald lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost freeboard (the level of a ship's deck above the water).|$|E
5|$|The {{police at}} first {{believed}} that Sheila, diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned {{the gun on}} herself. But weeks after the murders Jeremy Bamber's ex-girlfriend told police that he had implicated himself. The prosecution argued that, motivated by a large inheritance, Bamber had shot the family with his father's semi-automatic rifle, then placed {{the gun in his}} unstable sister's hands {{to make it look like}} a murder–suicide. A silencer the prosecution said was on the rifle <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> too long, they argued, for Sheila's fingers to reach the trigger to shoot herself. Bamber was convicted of five counts of murder in October 1986 by a 10–2 majority, sentenced to a minimum of 25 years, and informed in 1994 that he would never be released. The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in 2002.|$|E
5|$|There {{are almost}} no written sources {{from which to}} re-construct the {{demography}} of early Medieval Scotland. Estimates have been made of a population of 10,000 inhabitants in Dál Riata and 80–100,000 for Pictland. It {{is likely that the}} 5th and 6th centuries saw higher mortality rates due to the appearance of bubonic plague, which may have reduced net population. The known conditions have been taken to suggest it was a high fertility, high mortality society, similar to many developing countries in the modern world, with a relatively young demographic profile, and perhaps early childbearing, and large numbers of children for women. This would have meant that there were a relatively small proportion of available workers to the number of mouths to feed. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> difficult to produce a surplus that would allow demographic growth and more complex societies to develop.|$|E

5|$|By 1909, it {{had spread}} to the Orange River Colony. In South Africa, as at Azusa Street, the {{movement}} was initially multi-racial, appealing to both Boers and blacks. It expanded rapidly among African farm workers in the Orange River Colony and Wakkerstroom, where Pentecostal beliefs in divine healing through prayer <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> an attractive alternative to traditional or medical treatment. Lake made contact with the Wakkerstroom Zionists led by Pieter Louis Le Roux, and many Zionists joined the Apostolic Faith Mission. Their influence {{can be seen in}} the AFM's practice of baptism by triple immersion, once each in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. There was also interaction with other churches, such as the Plymouth Brethren and International Holiness movement, which often resulted in individuals or whole congregations joining the AFM. Most AFM converts, however, came from the Dutch Reformed churches.|$|E
5|$|There {{are almost}} no written sources {{from which to}} {{reconstruct}} the demography of early medieval Scotland. Estimates have been made of a population of 10,000 in Dál Riata and 80–100,000 for Pictland, which was probably the largest region. It {{is likely that the}} fifth and sixth centuries saw higher mortality rates due to the appearance of bubonic plague, which may have reduced the population. The examination of burial sites for this period, such as that at Hallowhill, St Andrews, indicates a life expectancy of only 26 to 29. The known conditions have been taken to suggest it was a high fertility, high mortality society, similar to developing countries in the modern world, with a relatively young demographic profile, and perhaps early childbearing, and large numbers of children born to each woman (although with high child mortality). This would have meant a relatively low ratio of available workers to the number of mouths to feed, which in turn <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> difficult to produce a surplus that would allow demographic growth and the development of more complex societies.|$|E

25|$|The therapsids had {{sprawling}} forelimbs and semi-erect hindlimbs.
