5|$|The Prometheus {{lands on}} the barren, mountainous surface near a large, {{artificial}} structure, which a team explores. Inside, they find stone cylinders, a monolithic statue of a humanoid head, and the decapitated corpse of a large alien, thought to be an Engineer; Shaw recovers its head. The crew finds other bodies, leading them to surmise the species is extinct. Crew members Millburn and Fifield grow uncomfortable with the discoveries and attempt to return to Prometheus, but become stranded in the structure when they get lost. The expedition is cut short when a storm forces the crew {{to return to the}} ship. David secretly takes a cylinder from the structure, while the remaining cylinders begin leaking a dark liquid. In the ship's lab, the Engineer's DNA is found to match that of humans. David investigates the cylinder and the liquid inside. He intentionally taints a drink with the liquid and gives it to the unsuspecting Holloway, who had stated he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> answers. Shortly after, Shaw and Holloway have sex.|$|E
25|$|On 3 January {{the third}} debate took place, hosted by RTL Televizija. The main topics were {{the return of}} former prime {{minister}} Ivo Sanader to the political scene, the economy, taxes and foreign relations, especially with Slovenia. Bandić once again repeated {{he was a man}} of work who <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> the people, while Josipović demonstrated his knowledge of law and foreign policy. On the next day, the results of a second set of election polls were published, showing Bandić made some gains, but Josipović's support was mostly unchanged.|$|E
500|$|Capper, {{described}} as [...] "a gentle and easily influenced girl," [...] had been babysitting for Jean Powell {{since she was}} ten years old. In 1990 she had spent time {{in the care of}} the local authority after her mother, Elizabeth Capper, and her stepfather separated, after which Suzanne and her older sister Michelle stayed with their stepfather. Around this time Capper began to truant from Moston Brook High School, and her attendance during the final two years of schooling was {{described as}} [...] "erratic." [...] Capper increasingly spent her time at Powell's house. Powell lived at 97 Langworthy Road, Moston, a small Victorian terraced house, where she also dealt drugs and was involved with the handling of stolen motor vehicles. Michelle Capper had briefly lived with Powell, but moved out in August 1992 because she did not like the [...] "evil new friends" [...] Powell was associating with, particularly Bernadette McNeilly, who had recently moved in three doors away at number 91. McNeilly, who had three children, subsequently moved in with Powell and her three children, where the two shared a bed in the downstairs dining room because the bedrooms were [...] "full of children." [...] Capper continued to stay regularly even though Powell and McNeilly frequently bullied her. Her sister said: [...] "It was not that she was scared of them, it's just that she <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> them. She pampered their every whim." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Blank Page" [...] is {{a simplistic}} piano {{arranged}} ballad, which lasts for a duration of [...] (four minutes and four seconds). Her vocal range spans from F3 to G5. Lyrically, {{the song is}} about how Aguilera wishes to [...] "wipe the slate clean" [...] with a former lover and [...] "reconcile an old romance". She knows that she has wronged him, but is asking {{to be given a}} second chance. Andrew Hampp for Billboard noted that this sentiment is revealed by Aguilera in the lyrics [...] "If I could do undo that I hurt you/ I <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> us to make it through". The song begins with the chords of a piano as Aguilera sings [...] "I know there's hurt/ I know there's pain/ But people change/ Lord, knows I've been no saint/ In my own way/ Regret choices I've made/ How I do I say I'm sorry?/ How do I say I'm sorry?." [...] On the chorus, the lyrics are hopeful that she can right any wrongs she may have committed: [...] "Draw me a smile, and save me tonight/ I'll be your blank page waiting for you to bring me to life/ Paint me a heart, let me be your art/ I am a blank page waiting for life to start/ Let our hearts start and beat as one together/ Let our hearts start and beat as one forever". The arrangement of the minimalist piano composition is [...] "fiery" [...] yet [...] "spare". Aside from garnering innumerable comparisons to Aguilera's own song [...] "Beautiful", the composition of [...] "Blank Page" [...] was subject to critique by Jim Farber writing for New York Daily News. He criticised the song for replicating the structure and lyrical content of [...] "Someone Like You", a song performed by English singer-songwriter Adele: ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} side of the feud, to hold the territory, Gebhard needed the full support of his {{military}} brother and the very able Neuenahr. To push Ernst out, he needed additional support, which he had requested from Delft and from England. It was clearly in the interests of England and the Dutch to offer assistance; if the Dutch could not tie up the Spanish army in Flanders, and if that army needed a navy to supply it, Philip could not focus his attention on the English and the French. His own diplomats had sought to present his case as one of pressing concern to all Protestant princes: in November, 1583, one of his advisers, Dr. Wenceslaus Zuleger, wrote to Francis Walsingham: [...] "I assure you if the Elector of Cologne is not assisted, you will see that the war in the Low Countries will shortly spread over the whole of Germany." [...] The support Gebhard received, in the form of troops from the Earl of Leicester, and from the Dutch, in the form of the mercenary Martin Schenck, had mixed results. Leicester's troops, professional and well-led, performed well but their usefulness was limited: Elizabeth's instructions to help Gebhard had not come with financial support and Leicester had sold his own plate and had exhausted his own personal credit while trying to field an army. Martin Schenck had seen considerable service in Spain's Army of Flanders, for the French king and for Parma himself. He was a skilled and charismatic soldier, and his men <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> him; reportedly, he could sleep in his saddle, and seemed indomitable in the field. Unfortunately, Schenck was little more than a land-pirate, a free-booter, and rascal, and ultimately he did Gebhard more harm than good, as his behavior in Westphalia and at the Battle of Werl demonstrated.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{before her}} Hollyoaks entrance, a {{reporter}} for The Sun stated that Lynsey would be [...] "a hit with the boys", while putting other girls' noses out of joint. During {{an interview with a}} reporter from the show's official website, Hassan explained that Lynsey had been best friends with Cheryl for a long time. When Lynsey joined Cheryl in the village, she quickly found herself a job at the local hospital and fell in love. Hassan described Lynsey as being [...] "a very loyal person", who wanted to see the best in people and <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> her family and friends. Hassan tried to make her character's personality similar to her own, so she would be believable to the viewers. Hassan felt that on occasion Lynsey needed to stand up for herself, agreeing with the reporter who called her [...] "a bit of a push-over." [...] She later said that Lynsey should speak her true opinions more and stop being [...] "a soft touch". A new side to the character started to emerge when she began to grow a backbone and Hassan opined that Lynsey could [...] "hold her own". The actress commented to an OK! journalist that Lynsey was the typical girl next door, who could stand [...] "on her own two feet" [...] and speak what was on her mind. Hassan also thought that she had a very long fuse, but if it reached the end then you would see the spark in her.|$|E
2500|$|The buildup to Steven's exit {{involved}} in a bisexual love triangle storyline between him, Stacey and Christian Clarke (John Partridge), who is the gay brother of Jane. On-screen, Steven and Stacey's friendship progressed into something more serious in March 2008, when they shared a kiss. Steven later decided {{he was ready to}} lose his virginity to Stacey, and took Ian's advice [...] "to try to name the England football team and substitutes as a technique for pacing himself," [...] which Sidwell has described as, [...] "a really funny scene to film [...] my favourite comedy moment since joining the show." [...] Speaking of the character's impending exit, he added: [...] "Steven loves Stacey as a friend, and <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> her. He misreads loving someone as being 'in love', though. Things aren't right between them, and he can't put his finger on the reason why. That's what's going to lead him to question his sexuality..." [...] On-screen, Steven was unable to consummate his love for Stacey, and after an emotional rant, he kissed Christian. The filming of the storyline posed difficulties for Aaron Sidwell; {{in an interview with the}} Daily Star he explained, [...] " [...] a really good friend of mine, so kissing her was weird, but we just got on with it! But I found it really challenging to kiss [...] because I'm not gay [...] I saw the conflict teenagers go through when they're struggling to come to terms with their sexuality. [...] is a cracking scene and I'm really pleased with it." [...] The storyline progressed with Steven denying his homosexual tendencies, leading Christian to continuously try and [...] "out" [...] him. John Partridge, has commented, [...] "Christian knew Steven was gay from the outset. He noticed Steven had tendencies that he himself had as a young man – and his gaydar is very good [...] Christian didn't ask to be kissed by Steven but now that it's happened he wants the boy to admit that he's gay. He basically wants to help him. Steven doesn't want to be gay and Christian knows how he feels. Coming out is hard for any young man [...] Christian's worried that Stacey is going to get hurt. He knows that when you're gay, you're gay. That's it. There's nothing you can do about it and if you try to hide it, people get hurt." [...] After the truth was revealed to Stacey, Steven falsely claimed to Ian that Christian had attempted to seduce him – a means of revenge for Christian's rejection. The following episode, Christian was banished from the Beales lives by Ian, although the truth eventually came out and Ian, despite initial concerns, was shown to be supportive of Steven's sexuality. The plot has been described as [...] "controversial" [...] and gay actor John Partridge has confessed that he had worries about it initially: [...] "A gay man having any sort of relationship with an 18-year-old boy is a bit contentious. However, I think it has been handled really well." ...|$|E
