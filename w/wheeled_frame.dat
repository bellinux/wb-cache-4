50|$|The frame {{position}} {{can usually}} be adjusted {{with respect to the}} skate, to adjust for a skater's individual foot, ankle and leg characteristics. Frame positioning is very critical as even a minor change from the skater's actual frame position can lead to severe foot pain. Also, many times it leads to 'locking' of the skater's ankle and/or calf muscle, thereby restricting its movements. It may take a skater several days to weeks to test and adjust the frame position of his new skates. The typical Inline mounting is 195mm, which is different from the ice mounting of 165mm. The frame usually mounts three, four, or five polyurethane wheels. The three <b>wheel</b> <b>frames</b> are used by skaters with small feet, otherwise 4 <b>wheel</b> <b>frames</b> are commonly used, with 90 mm to 110 mm diameter <b>wheels.</b> Five-wheel <b>frames</b> with smaller <b>wheel</b> have lost favor. Each wheel contains two ball bearings with an aluminum spacer, held in place with an axle screwed into the frame.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A new {{approach}} for the precise grinding of crankshaft pin is presented. In which, noncircular following strategy is investigated {{based on the}} motion model consists of horizontal feeding axis, additional lifting axis for <b>wheel</b> <b>frame,</b> and the active rotary axis for workpiece. The straight line relationship of wheel center, pin center and grinding point is ensured by the synchronism between standard arc interpolation motion of <b>wheel</b> <b>frame</b> and eccentric circular motion of pin section. Comparing with traditional tangential point tracing scheme, both constant grinding line-speed and simple control algorithm are fulfilled simultaneously. The negative effect of perpendicular deviation introduced by lifting axis is kinematically analyzed {{as well as the}} dynamic response error of servo system, and solving methods are carried out accordingly. By computer simulation and experimental test, the reported noncircular following strategy emerges good characteristics in the manufacturing of crankshaft, such as a strong adaptability for wheel wearing, simple motion control and high roundness precision...|$|R

50|$|This {{all changed}} with the {{invention}} of the lawnmower by Edwin Beard Budding in 1830. Budding had the idea for a lawnmower after seeing a machine in a local cloth mill which used a cutting cylinder (or bladed reel) mounted on a bench to trim the irregular nap from the surface of woollen cloth and give a smooth finish. Budding realised that a similar device could be used to cut grass if the mechanism was mounted in a <b>wheeled</b> <b>frame</b> to make the blades rotate close to the lawn's surface. His mower design was to be used primarily to cut the lawn on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the scythe, and he was granted a British patent on 31 August 1830.|$|E
5000|$|During the Iron Age, in {{the ancient}} Middle East and Mediterranean,the {{battering}} ram's log was slung from a <b>wheeled</b> <b>frame</b> by ropes or chains {{so that it could}} be made more massive and be more easily bashed against its target. Frequently, the ram's point would be reinforced with a metal head or cap while vulnerable parts of the shaft were bound with strengthening metal bands. Vitruvius details in his text On Architecture that Ceras the Carthaginian was the first to make a ram with a wooden base with wheels and a wooden superstructure. Within this the ram was hung so that it could be used against the wall. This structure moved so slowly, however, that he called it the testudo (the Latin word for [...] "tortoise").|$|E

50|$|A {{motorcycle}} trailer may be {{a trailer}} designed to haul motorcycles behind an automobile or truck. Such trailers may be open or enclosed, {{ranging in size from}} trailers capable of carrying several motorcycles or only one. They may be designed specifically to carry motorcycles, with ramps and tie-downs, or {{may be a}} utility trailer adapted permanently or occasionally to haul one or more motorcycles. Another type of motorcycle trailer is a <b>wheeled</b> <b>frame</b> with a hitch system designed for transporting cargo by motorcycle. Motorcycle trailers are often narrow and styled to match the appearance of the motorcycle they are intended to be towed behind. You can get either two wheeled versions or single wheeled version. The single wheeled versions, such as the Unigo or Pav 40/41, are designed to allow the bike to have all the normal flexibility of a motorcycle, usually using a universal joint to enable the trailer to lean and turn with the motorcycle. No motorcycle manufacturer recommends that its motorcycles be used to tow a trailer because it creates additional safety hazards for motorcyclists.|$|E
5000|$|Budding had {{the idea}} of the {{lawnmower}} after seeing a machine in a local cloth mill which used a cutting cylinder (or bladed reel) mounted on a bench to trim the irregular nap from the surface of woollen cloth and give a smooth finish.Budding's mower was designed primarily to cut the lawn on sports grounds and extensive gardens, as a superior alternative to the scythe, and was granted a British patent on 31 August 1830. [...] It took ten more years and further innovations to create a machine that could be worked by animals, and sixty years before a steam-powered lawn mower was built. The first machine produced was 19 inches in width with a frame made of wrought iron. The mower was pushed from behind with motive power coming from the rear land roller which drove gears to transfer the drive to the knives on the cutting cylinder; the ratio was 16:1. There was another roller placed in between the cutting cylinder and the land roller which was adjustable to alter the height of cut. On cutting, the grass clippings were hurled forward into a tray like box. It was soon realized, however, that an extra handle was needed in front of the machine which could be used to help pull it along. Two of the earliest Budding machines sold went to Regent's Park Zoological Gardens in London and the Oxford Colleges. [...] In an agreement between John Ferrabee and Edwin Budding, dated 18 May 1830, Ferrabee paid the costs of development, obtained letters of patent and acquired rights to manufacture, sell and license other manufacturers in the production of lawn mowers. Budding realised that a similar device could be used to cut grass if the mechanism was mounted in a <b>wheeled</b> <b>frame</b> to make the blades rotate close to the lawn's surface. Budding went into partnership with a local engineer, John Ferrabee, and together they made mowers in a factory at Thrupp near Stroud.|$|E

40|$|QuestionsWhat {{walking aid}} {{prescription}} occurs at discharge after hip fracture? What changes in walking aid use {{occur in the}} following six months? Who initiates changes in walking aids and why?DesignProspective longitudinal observational study. Participants 95 community-dwelling older adults who had undergone surgical treatment of a hip fracture. Outcome measuresRange of walking aids prescribed at discharge and participants’ recall of advice about progression were recorded. Progression of walking aids was observed fortnightly over 6 months. With any change in walking aid use, an independent physiotherapist determined if it was appropriate and participants reported {{the reason for the}} change. ResultsMost participants were discharged from their final inpatient setting with a <b>wheeled</b> <b>frame</b> (92 %). Eighty-two (86 %) participants were not aware of any goals set by the physiotherapist for the first 6 months and 89 (94 %) stated that a review time had not been set. Despite this, 78 (82 %) participants changed their walking aid, on average 8 weeks (SD 6) after discharge. However, 32 % of those who changed their walking aids were using an inappropriate aid or using it incorrectly. Six months after discharge, 40 % of participants had not returned to using their pre-morbid indoor aid and 50 % their outdoor aid. ConclusionA review of walking aid by a physiotherapist is rare within six months after discharge following hip fracture. Most patients make their own decision about what walking aid is most appropriate. This has safety implications in a group at high risk of falls...|$|E
