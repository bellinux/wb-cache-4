5|$|Dedicated to Mme la Baronne V. d'Indy, {{the fifth}} barcarolle was written after {{a five-year period}} in which Fauré {{composed}} nothing for the piano. Orledge calls it powerful, agitated and virile. It {{is the first of}} Fauré's piano works in <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> identifiable sections; its changes are in metre, not in tempo.|$|E
5|$|Zinc and cadmium are {{electropositive}} while {{mercury is}} not. As a result, zinc and cadmium metal are good reducing agents. The elements of group 12 have an oxidation state of +2 {{in which the}} ions have the rather stable d10 electronic configuration, with a full sub-shell. However, mercury can easily be reduced to the +1 oxidation state; usually, as in the ion , two mercury(I) ions come {{together to form a}} metal-metal bond and a diamagnetic species. Cadmium can also form species such as 4− in which the metal's oxidation state is +1. Just as with mercury, the formation of a metal-metal bond results in a diamagnetic compound in <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> unpaired electrons; thus, making the species very reactive. Zinc(I) is known only in the gas phase, in such compounds as linear Zn2Cl2, analogous to calomel.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system remains}} unchanged from Ridge Racer, the checkpoint and time limit system remain the same; {{running out of}} time ends the race and passing through checkpoints grants additional time, although the car drifting is more like Ridge Racer 2. The player drives using automatic transmission or manual transmission. Ridge Racer Revolution supports Namco's NeGcon controller, and adds a rear-view mirror when using the in-car view. The game consists of three courses: 'Novice', 'Intermediate' (also called 'Advanced'), and 'Expert', each having different sections opened, and incorporates modes from the original game; Race, against eleven opponents, and Time Trial, against one. Ridge Racer Revolution adds a mode: Free Run, in <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> other cars and the player practises driving. There is no lap limit. How fast the cars run depends on which speed grade is used, selectable in Free Run, and can be unlocked for Race. It is not available in Time Trial. A new feature is the option to select the time of day in which the race takes place, although this is not available {{at the start of the}} game. Ridge Racer Revolution features a two-player link-up mode which allows the players access to the original Ridge Racers courses known as 'Special 1' and 'Special 2'. There are two modes in two-player link-up: Race, identical to its single-player counterpart, and Versus, where only the players race against each other. Versus features a handicap option, increasing the speed of the trailing car.|$|E

5|$|The team of Curry Man and Shark Boy were {{pitted against}} Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray), who were {{accompanied}} by Johnny Devine, in a thirteen-minute-and-twelve-second Fish Market Street Fight. Prior to this bout, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that if Team 3D made weight, then the weight restriction on them would be lifted. Also, that Kurt Angle originally won the Six Sides of Steel Cage match against Christian Cage, however the decision with The Unlikely Alliance gaining the advantage in the Six Man Tag Team match was still in effect. Before the bout, both members of Team 3D were weighed, with both coming in below the mark. In a Fish Market Street Fight the match is won by pinfall or submission, in <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> disqualifications and the ring area is covered by fish paraphernalia. Devine interfered in the match near the end, accidentally throwing white powder in Ray's face. This led to Shark Boy tossing {{him out of the}} ring and through a table. Afterwards, Ray mistakenly performed Team 3D's signature tag team maneuver the 3D on Devon with Curry Man, allowing Shark Boy to cover for the pinfall victory.|$|E

25|$|When one pinhole is closed, {{the grid}} of wires causes appreciable {{diffraction}} in the light, and blocks {{a certain amount}} of light received by the corresponding photon-detector. However, when both pinholes are open, the effect of the wires is negligible, comparable to the case in <b>which</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> wires placed in front of the lens (Fig.3), because the wires lie in the dark fringes, which the photons avoid. The effect is not dependent on the light intensity (photon flux).|$|E
