500|$|... "Follow Me Home" [...] {{was written}} by the Sugababes—Keisha Buchanan, Mutya Buena, and Heidi Range—in {{collaboration}} with Jonathan Lipsey, Karen Poole, and Jeremy Shaw, for the group's fourth studio album, Taller in More Ways (2005). Lipsey developed {{the idea of a}} close person as the song's inspiration. Buena wrote the first verse based upon her daughter Tahlia, who was born in March 2005. While writing the verse, she pondered questions such as 'What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> her if she was ever in trouble?', and 'How would you say, I’ll always be there for you?'. Buena wanted people to interpret the verse in different ways, and stated that the lyrics came naturally. Buchanan drew inspiration from her close friend when she wrote the other verse. Lipsey produced the song under his production name Jony Rockstar. [...] "Follow Me Home" [...] was mixed and engineered at Metropolis Studios by Tom Elmhirst and Richard Wilkinson, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|The next track, [...] "The Sound of War" [...] is a near eight-minute {{folk song}} that {{declares}} [...] "chaos remains." [...] It features the lyric [...] "the buzzing of the drones," [...] which appear {{later in the}} song, adding a [...] "moody, cinematic soundscape." [...] The track begins [...] "with {{the sound of a}} mountain stream and all manner of bird calls, it blossoms out into a modern madrigal, with lute-like guitar and Sundfør's voice restrained and husky. About halfway through, it falls away to leave a hellish, industrial synth drone, reminiscent of the textures of The Knife's Shaking The Habitual, or the ambient sound design of a David Lynch soundtrack." [...] Described as [...] "an art installation-like interlude," [...] the [...] "glitchy" [...] title track begins with an echoing voice punctuated by bleeps (samples of Gesang der Jünglinge by Karlheinz Stockhausen) that recall sound effects from 80s sci-fi, and follows with a spoken passage from naturist Andres Roberts, in which he responds to the question: [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> someone who has given up on life?" [...] asked in an interview by Sundfør. Halfway through the song, a plucked acoustic guitar, later accompanied by a flute, carries the song to its conclusion. Tom Pinnock of Fopp said Sundfør embraces musique concrète on the track. The [...] "spooky, meditative" [...] track [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] contains [...] "ambient footsteps, cell phone beeps, and wandering clarinet that highlight the cruel boredom of insomnia." [...] The Quietus described it as the album's [...] "most lyrical moment: a sweeping fusion of piano and clarinet that recalls the heady, jazz-flecked adventuring of Joni Mitchell and her woodwind virtuoso Tom Scott on For the Roses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early on, Hayashi {{said they}} {{attempted}} to move on from relying just on sex and violence: [...] "We’re {{trying to focus on}} the real women that surround us; the voice of a female, the mannerisms. We are being realistic about it. We want to show something that’s more high class, that adult males of our generation could look at a woman [...] and be impressed with her as a woman, not just as a pin-up," [...] as opposed to the previous concept of just [...] "make her breasts big and just make them jiggle." [...] Dead or Alive 5s overseas producer Peter Garza said the game's revised aesthetic direction: [...] "Dead or Alive is known for its sexiness and high-kicking characters and certain aspects of the physics engine... Those are definitely going to be in Dead or Alive 5 - it's part of the series, it's part of its history and it's part of why people like it. But we're trying to take a bit more of a mature take on it." [...] After the release, the game's director Yohei Shimbori said they were originally [...] "getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality -- to tone down the sexiness of the game, and of the characters." [...] However, the team then changed their decision due to negative feedback from fans who were playing the alpha demo version who demanded bigger breasts. Shimbori said: [...] "That was kind of surprising. There's definitely still room for having sexualized aspects," [...] adding that he [...] "really tries" [...] to take fan feedback into account and to keep an open mind. Hayashi himself made a 180 turn from his previous position. Asked [...] "what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> those people who think that the bikini-clad babes in DOA5 are sexist," [...] he said their goal was to create [...] "the cutest chicks in videogames" [...] and so they made a lot of effort to develop an advanced breast physics model that works differently with various types of clothing. Their product received the ESRB rating of Mature 17+ (Partial Nudity, Sexual Themes, Violence).|$|E

5000|$|Once Thompson began voicing Geoff Peterson live, he {{incorporated}} {{several of}} his own impressions into the character's repertoire. He has performed his Morgan Freeman impression for Freeman during the actor's appearances. In June 2011, Geoff asked Freeman, [...] "Would you like to hear my Morgan Freeman voice?" [...] and [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> yourself?". Freeman gave the impression a thumbs-up and called it [...] "outstanding".|$|R

Thompson says his live segments are [...] "100% unscripted and improvised". Since Thompson began voicing Geoff Peterson live, he has incorporated {{several of his}} own impressions into the character's repertoire. He also performed his Morgan Freeman impression for Freeman himself on June 10, 2011, asking the amazed actor [...] "Would you like to hear my Morgan Freeman voice?" [...] and [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> yourself?". Freeman called the impression [...] "outstanding".|$|R

6000|$|... "What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> now," [...] asked Mr Tippet, seating {{himself on}} his bench, or rather {{on the top of}} a number of gimblets and chisels and files and pincers that lay on it; [...] "what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> now <b>to</b> sitting from morning till night in a dusty ware-room, where the light is so feeble that it can {{scarcely}} penetrate the dirt that encrusts the windows, writing in books that are so greasy that the ink can hardly be got to mark the paper? How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> like that, William Willders--eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{know a few}} things, sir, and I don't {{tell all}} I know. Mark that," [...] the uncle replied.

6000|$|... "Because {{her aunt}} {{told her that}} she had {{encouraged}} this man. What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> have a girl say when she is falsely accused like that? <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> it <b>to</b> me merely because some horrid man would come and speak to me?" [...] Then there came a slight pang of conscience as she remembered Isadore Hamel in Kensington Gardens. If the men were not thought to be horrid, then perhaps the speaking might be a sin worthy of most severe accusation.|$|R
6000|$|She {{laid her}} fair {{hand on my}} head, {{and looked at me}} thoughtfully. [...] "Forget my rank," [...] she whispered--"have I not set you the example? Suppose that I am nothing but an English Miss. What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Miss?" ...|$|E

A common sense interpretation of the facts suggests that a superintellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as with chemistry and biology, and that there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature. The numbers one calculates from the facts seem to me so overwhelming as to put this conclusion almost beyond question." [...] Fred Hoyle ...|$|R
5000|$|The sports talk in {{the show}} was mixed in with {{different}} pre-produced comedy bits and features which many times lead the show to commercial break.
