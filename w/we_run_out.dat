Klotz replied at 20:46:03 that they could hold for five more minutes. The controller once again inquired as to their alternate airport and Klotz replied at 20:46:24, [...] "It was Boston but we can't do it now we, we, don't, <b>we</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of fuel now." [...] A handoff controller listening in on the conversation called the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (NY TRACON) at 20:46:24 and advised the TRACON controller that Avianca Flight 52 could only hold for five more minutes. The handoff controller asked whether NY TRACON could take the flight or whether to send Avianca to its alternate airport. The NY TRACON controller replied, [...] "Slow him to one eight zero knots and I'll take him." [...] The handoff controller later testified that he had not heard Flight 52 say that they could no longer reach their alternate airport. At 20:46:47, the NY ARTCC radar controller cleared the flight to proceed to JFK at [...] and to slow to [...] Flight 52 departed the CAMRN holding pattern at 20:47.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} August 15 CIA analysts, despite their overall skeptical {{conclusions}} had noted, “Sightings of UFO's reported at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, {{at a time}} when the background radiation count had risen inexplicably. Here <b>we</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of even [...] "blue yonder" [...] explanations that might be tenable, and, we still are left with numbers of incredible reports from credible observers.” On December 2, 1952 [...] CIA Assistant Director Chadwell noted, “Recent reports reaching CIA indicated that further action was desirable and another briefing by the cognizant A-2 and ATIC personnel was held on 25 November. At this time, the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention. The details of some of these incidents have been discussed by AD/SI with DDCI. Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles”.|$|E
2500|$|The CIA {{started their}} own {{internal}} scientific review the following day. Some CIA scientists were also seriously considering the ETH. An early memo from August was very skeptical, but also added, [...] "...as {{long as a}} series of reports remains 'unexplainable' (interplanetary aspects and alien origin not being thoroughly excluded from consideration) caution requires that intelligence continue coverage of the subject." [...] A report from later that month was similarly skeptical but nevertheless concluded [...] "...sightings of UFOs reported at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, {{at a time when the}} background radiation count had risen inexplicably. Here <b>we</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of even 'blue yonder' explanations that might be tenable, and we still are left with numbers of incredible reports from credible observers." [...] A December 1952 memo from the Assistant CIA Director of Scientific Intelligence (O/SI) was much more urgent: [...] "...the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention. Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of U.S. defense installation are of such nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles." [...] Some of the memos also made it clear that CIA interest in the subject was not to be made public, partly in fear of possible public panic. (Good, 331–335) ...|$|E

5000|$|This didn't {{include any}} great drama, just normal things. First of all, we went {{five years in}} a row without a decent break, so <b>we</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> of ideas and energy.
