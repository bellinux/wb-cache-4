25|$|The R44 was {{the first}} car since the BMT Green Hornet to {{incorporate}} a two-note <b>warning</b> <b>tone,</b> the first two notes of Westminster Quarters, that sounds before the doors begin to close as the train prepares to leave the station. When the cars were built, the chime was sounded four seconds before the doors closed, but the time delay was later removed. This has become the signature sound of the subway and is used with all subsequent cars.|$|E

25|$|During the General Overhaul Program, from 1991 to 1993, the {{remaining}} R44s were rebuilt by the NYCTA {{either at the}} 207th Street Yard in Manhattan or the Coney Island Complex in Brooklyn (cars 5342-5479 and all SIR cars) and by Morrison-Knudsen off NYCTA premises (cars 5202-5341). Some improvements included the repainting of the carbon steel blue stripes into silver gray stripes, although NYCTA-operated cars 5228-5229 and all SIR cars had their carbon steel sections replaced with stainless steel panels. The rollsigns on the sides were replaced with electronic LCD signs on the NYCTA-operated cars and were completely removed on the SIR cars. The SIR-operated R44s, however, retained their original two-note <b>warning</b> <b>tones</b> unlike their NYCTA-operated counterparts, which had their <b>warning</b> <b>tones</b> replaced with the same ones that are found on the R62s, R62As, R68s and R68As.|$|R

50|$|During the GOH, {{the fleet}} {{received}} the same LCD destination signs as the R44s, replacing the older rollsigns and the blue stripes {{on the side of}} the cars were removed, resulting in the appearance of an entirely unpainted carbody (the fiberglass ends remain painted silver to match the stainless sides). Other improvements included the rebuilding of all mechanical systems and making the R46 more compatible with other car types. The R46 cars were linked into sets following their general overhaul. Like the R44s, their original two-note <b>warning</b> <b>tones</b> were replaced with the same ones found on the R62, R62A, R68 and R68A, although there are a few cars that still retain their original <b>warning</b> <b>tones.</b> Due to the overhaul, the fleet's reliability has vastly improved, and the R46 is no longer considered to be the lemon that it once was.|$|R

6000|$|Still Aristodicus was not satisfied; and, {{as if by}} way of {{bringing}} home to the oracle somewhat more forcibly {{a sense of the}} true character of such an action as it seemed to recommend, he began to make a circuit in the grove which was around the temple in which the oracle resided, and to rob and destroy the nests which the birds had built there, allured, apparently, by the sacred repose and quietude of the scene. This had the desired effect. A solemn voice was heard from the interior of the temple, saying, in a <b>warning</b> <b>tone,</b> ...|$|E
50|$|In the United States, the {{recorder}} <b>warning</b> <b>tone</b> is a half-second burst of 1400 Hz applied every 15 seconds. The recorder <b>warning</b> <b>tone</b> {{is required by}} law to be generated {{as an integral part of}} any recording device used for the purpose and is required to be not under the control of the calling party.

50|$|Like Federal Signal's {{previous}} Electronic Outdoor Warning Siren series, the Modulator {{can produce}} six standard <b>warning</b> <b>tones.</b> The six standard tones are: Steady, Wail, Alternating Wail, Alternating Steady, Pulsed Wail, Hi-lo, and Pulsed Steady. If properly equipped, the Modulator can also employ voice notification to give specific {{information or to}} give a more clear understanding of an emergency situation. For testing purposes, a Westminster Chime can be played.|$|R

50|$|Another {{topic that}} affects the {{function}} of hindsight bias is the auditory function of humans. To test the effects of auditory distractions on hindsight bias, four experiments were completed. Experiment one included plain words, in which low-pass filters were used to reduce the amplitude for sounds of consonants; thereby, making the words more degraded. In the naïve-identification task, participants were presented a <b>warning</b> <b>tone</b> before hearing the degraded words. In the hindsight estimation task, a <b>warning</b> <b>tone</b> was presented before the clear word followed by the degraded version of the word. Experiment two included words with explicit warnings of the hindsight bias. It followed the same procedure as experiment one, however, the participants were informed and asked not to complete the same error. Experiment three included full sentences of degraded words rather than individual words. Experiment four included less-degraded words {{in order to make}} the words easier to understand and identify to the participants.|$|E

50|$|By the 1980s, in {{northern}} {{parts of the}} United States, many local television stations placed a ticker on-screen during local and network morning newscasts to disseminate information on weather-related school, church and business closings. Severe weather watch and warning information was also commonly disseminated by local station via a ticker, later accompanied by a map of an entire state or the station's viewing area (through a system known as First Warning). In both cases, {{the start of the}} ticker's cycle was often accompanied by an attention signal, such as <b>warning</b> <b>tones,</b> an abbreviated cut from the station's news theme or a jingle used by their affiliated network (such as the NBC Chimes).|$|R
