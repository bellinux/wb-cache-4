5|$|After {{the deal}} in Marysville fell through, ISC courted another site, this time south of Bremerton National Airport in Bremerton, WA just across Puget Sound from Seattle. Although like the Marysville {{proposal}} the proposal in Bremerton {{was to be}} partially funded with public money, the money <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> directly from taxes but instead from bonds funded by taxes, in a scheme {{similar to the one}} used to fund Kansas Speedway. Also like the Marysville proposal, the Bremerton track would be publicly owned and leased to ISC for three races per year. ISC's current proposal was met with a lukewarm response from area lawmakers and citizens, but the company has promised to present an improved offer for early 2007.|$|E
5|$|Angie (Drea de Matteo) {{takes an}} instant dislike {{to her son}} Danny's (Beau Mirchoff) new girlfriend, Ana (Maiara Walsh), who she fears is too fun-loving and not serious enough. However, Danny feels {{comfortable}} talking to Ana, who seems to understand what he has been through. Ana assures Angie she is not going anywhere. Meanwhile, Katherine (Dana Delany) speaks to her psychiatrist at a mental clinic. She says the medicine is working, but she now realizes the person she has become and how much she has hurt her neighbors and friends. Karen (Kathryn Joosten) visits her and asks {{her to come back}} to Wisteria Lane, but Katherine says she <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> back because she does not feel she will be forgiven. Later, Karen returns with Bree, Lynette, Gabrielle and Susan, who comfort Katherine and say they will try to forgive her.|$|E
5|$|While her car {{is being}} serviced, Amy checks into the B where she meets Val and Eric and {{claims to be}} a trainee nurse to get a discount; but tells Victoria that she is {{actually}} 16 and has run away from foster care. Victoria tries to sneak Amy out without paying but Val catches her so she offers to pay her debt by working for them. The police arrive and inform Val that Amy stole her foster parents' car and she leaves with a social worker. Victoria stays in touch with Amy and when she runs away again, Victoria hides her in the B's basement. Val finds her and lets her stay but Eric insists she leave. Amy visits Val again and tells her that her foster parents have separated and she is moving to a care home. Amy locks herself in a bathroom and workers at the care home telephone Val, claiming she <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> out until Val arrives. Val arranges for Amy to stay at the B and later fosters her.|$|E

According to {{materials}} published by the University, funding for the SAHPC <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> from either the state or the University's regular operating budget. Instead, a separate campaign has been organized {{to raise the money}} for SAHPC from private donors.|$|E
25|$|The Irish Government {{was bound}} {{by the terms of}} the 1998 Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement to submit Articles 2 and 3 to {{amendment}} by referendum. To this end, the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution was adopted in June of the same year by 94% of those voting. The new wording describes the Irish nation as a community of individuals with a common identity rather than as a territory, and is intended to reassure unionists that a united Ireland <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> about without a majority of the Northern Ireland electorate declaring in favour of such a move.|$|E
25|$|Although jennies {{come into}} heat within 9 or 10 days of giving birth, their {{fertility}} remains low, {{and it is}} likely the reproductive tract has not returned to normal. Thus it is usual to wait one or two further oestrous cycles before rebreeding, unlike the practice with mares. Jennies are usually very protective of their foals, and some <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> into estrus while they have a foal at side. The time lapse involved in rebreeding, and the length of a jenny's gestation, means that a jenny will have fewer than one foal per year. Because of this and the longer gestation period, donkey breeders do not expect to obtain a foal every year, as horse breeders often do, but may plan for three foals in four years.|$|E

25|$|Utah {{finds the}} {{location}} of the next ordeal: solo rock climbing with no safety beside Angel Falls in Venezuela. He finds Bodhi and Grommet and chases them on the climb, but Grommet falters, falling to his death. Utah catches up to Bodhi, but he falls backward down the waterfall, completing what would have been the last ordeal; Bodhi has to redo the fourth ordeal because he bailed out on the wave when he chose to save Johnny. Seventeen months later, Utah finds him in the Pacific facing another giant wave. As Utah tries to get Bodhi to come back with him and pay for his crimes, he eventually lets Bodhi attempt to surf it, both knowing that he <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> back. The wave engulfs Bodhi, and Utah continues his career in the FBI and begins going through his own eight ordeals.|$|E
25|$|The batting {{order in}} {{baseball}} must be declared {{before the game}} begins, and can only be changed if a substitution occurs. Batting out of turn is a rule violation resulting in a penalty. When a manager makes a substitution, the new player must occupy the same place in the batting order as the old one. To allow more complicated changes in batting order, managers may use the double switch, substituting for two players simultaneously. This is typically used to replace the pitcher but put the new pitcher in {{a spot in the}} batting order that <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> up to bat soon, previously occupied by another fielder (pitchers are almost uniformly poor hitters much like most specialist bowlers are poor batsmen). However, the rule remains that no individual player can ever change his position in the batting order within the same game.|$|E
25|$|The scene changes {{again to}} a fairy garden with a palace in the {{background}} out of which Ada comes. She sings of how she is willing to sacrifice her immortality and pay the price, however hard it is, necessary to win Arindal (Wie muss ich doch beklagen). Arindal awakens and declares his joy at seeing Ada again, but she announces that he will abandon her the next day. Gernot, Gunther and Morald arrive with companions to fetch Arindal. Those who have not seen her before are struck by Ada's beauty and fear Arindal <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>come.</b> A procession of fairies {{comes out of the}} palace and Zemina and Farzana tell Ada that her father has died and she is now queen. Ada tells Arindal that they must part now but she will see him tomorrow. She asks him to swear that whatever happens he will not curse her. He swears it even though she takes back her request. She expresses her fear that they will both go under {{as a result of his}} breaking the oath.|$|E

25|$|Sahih Muslim and Sahih Bukhari record various recensions of a hadith where Muhammad had prophesised {{that the}} Day of Judgment <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> until Muslims and Jews fight each other. The Muslims will kill the Jews with such success {{that they will}} then hide behind stones or both trees and stones {{according}} to various recensions, which will then cry out to a Muslim that a Jew is hiding behind them {{and ask them to}} kill him. The only one not to do so will be the Gharqad tree as it is the tree of the Jews. Different interpretations about the Gharqad tree mentioned in the Hadith exists. One of the interpretations is that the Gharqad tree is an actual tree. Israelis have been alleged to plant the tree around various locations for e.g., their settlements in West Bank and Gaza, around Israel Museum and the Knesset. Other claims about the tree are that it grows outside Herod's Gate or that it is actually a bush that grows outside Jaffa Gate which some Muslims believe where Jesus will return to Earth and slay the Dajjal, following the final battle between the Muslims and unbelievers which some believe will take place directly below the Jaffa Gate below the Sultan's Pool. Another interpretation that exists is that the mention of the Gharqad tree is symbolic and is in reference to all the forces of the world believed to conspire with the Jews against Muslims.|$|E

[...] Irataba, weary of the constant fighting and worried that further conflicts with neighboring tribes would draw more attention from the US soldiers, organized a peace expedition to the Maricopa, settling the ancient disputes between the two peoples.|$|E

500|$|Achtung Baby was U2's {{first album}} {{in three years}} and their first {{comprising}} entirely new material in over four years. The group maintained a low profile after the record's release, avoiding interviews and allowing critics and the public {{to make their own}} assessments. Instead of participating in an article with Rolling Stone magazine, U2 asked Eno to write one for them. The marketing plan for the album focused on retail and press promotions. In addition to television and radio advertisements being produced, posters featuring the sleeve's 16images were distributed to record stores and through alternative newspapers in major cities. Compared to the large hype of other 1991 year-end releases, the marketing for Achtung Baby was relatively understated, as Island general manager Andy Allen explained: [...] "U2 <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>come</b> out with that kind of fanfare in terms of outside media. We feel the fan base itself creates that kind of excitement." ...|$|E
