Hansel & Gretel producers Ferrell, McKay, Messick, and Flynn were reported to return. In June 2013, McKay officially confirmed his involvement and said that [...] "everyone feels like as good as the first one is, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>really</b> jack it up a level with the second one. So, fingers crossed everyone will come back" [...] (including Renner and Arterton). McKay suggested that Paramount might insist harder to make the film rated PG-13 this time. Talking about Wirkola's [...] "pretty insane" [...] ideas for the second film, McKay said this could be one of those instances where the sequel does go further than the first one." [...] Regarding the storyline, he offered one hint: [...] "Think of different kinds of witchcraft." [...] It was revealed that the sequel will have a 2016 release date.|$|E

Occasionally there could be some writing. But I'm not trying to get in anybody's soup, I'm just trying to be helpful." [...] Whedon later elaborated that [...] "Since the story has already been approved and everybody knows what we're doing with Avengers 2, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>really</b> lay it out.

You want to honor {{the events of the last}} movie but you don't want to be beholden to them, because some people will see Avengers who did not see any of the movies in between or even Avengers 1."

Indeed, as early as February 27—two days after the sanctions were announced—school officials expressed doubt that SMU would have enough players to field a viable team in 1988.

Holly Ellingwood from Active Anime compared the manga to Rurouni Kenshin and Peacemaker Kurogane, and lauded the series for showing the reader the reality of that historical period. Leroy Douresseaux from Comic Book Bin described it as [...] "James Clavell meets Colleen McCullough", and praised Watanabe's artwork, which he said creates [...] "expressive characters and Oscar-worthy costume design". Douresseaux also said the faces of Watanabe's [...] characters [...] "are so captivating {{that they have a}} hypnotic effect on the reader", and {{that it is impossible to}} not love them.|$|E

2500|$|After Mill, critics {{focused on}} the ode's status among Wordsworth's other poems. In July 1877, Edward Dowden, in an article for the Contemporary Review, {{discussed}} the Transcendental Movement {{and the nature of}} the Romantic poets. when referring to Wordsworth and the ode, he claimed: [...] "Wordsworth in his later years lost, as he expresses it, courage, the spring-like hope and confidence which enables a man to advance joyously towards new discovery of truth. But the poet of 'Tintern Abbey' and the 'Ode on Intimations of Immortality' and the 'Prelude' is Wordsworth in his period of highest energy and imaginative light". Matthew Arnold, in his preface to an 1879 edition of Wordsworth's poetry, explains that he was a great lover of the poems. However, he explains why he believed that the ode was not one of the best: [...] "I have a warm admiration for Laodameia and for the great Ode; but if I am to tell the very truth, I find Laodameia not wholly free from something artificial, and the great Ode not wholly free from something declamatory." [...] His concern was over what he saw as the ideas expressed on childhood and maturity: [...] "Even the 'intimations' of the famous Ode, those corner-stones of the supposed philosophic system of Wordsworth... has itself not the character of poetic truth of the best kind; it has no real solidity" [...] "to say that universally this instinct is mighty in childhood, and tends to die away afterwards, is to say what is extremely doubtful... In general, we may say of these high instincts of early childhood... what Thucydides says of the early achievements of the Greek race:--'It is impossible to speak with certainty of what is so remove; but from all that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>really</b> investigate, I should say that they were no very great things.'" ...|$|E
