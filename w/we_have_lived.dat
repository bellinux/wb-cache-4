A {{few months ago}} a Contra force attacked the parish. They destroyed everything: the school, the health centre, the cultural centre. They raped nurses and teachers, slaughtered doctors, in the most brutal manner. They behaved like savages. Please demand that the US government withdraw its support from this shocking terrorist activity." [...] Seitz responded, [...] "Let me tell you something. In war, innocent people always suffer." [...] Pinter called the US invasion of Iraq [...] "an arbitrary military action inspired {{by a series of}} lies upon lies and gross manipulation of the media and therefore of the public", and condemned the British government for its cooperation.|$|E
500|$|By contrast, author Fay Weldon, while {{admitting that}} {{the series is}} [...] "not what the poets hoped for", {{nevertheless}} goes on to say, [...] "but this is not poetry, it is readable, saleable, everyday, useful prose". The literary critic A. N. Wilson praised the Harry Potter series in The Times, stating: [...] "There are not many writers who have JK's Dickensian ability to make us turn the pages, to weep – openly, with tears splashing – and a few pages later to laugh, at invariably good jokes... <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> through a decade {{in which we have}} followed the publication of the liveliest, funniest, scariest and most moving children's stories ever written". Charles Taylor of Salon.com, who is primarily a movie critic, took issue with Byatt's criticisms in particular. While he conceded that she may have [...] "a valid cultural point – a teeny one – about the impulses that drive us to reassuring pop trash and away from the troubling complexities of art", he rejected her claims that the series is lacking in serious literary merit and that it owes its success merely to the childhood reassurances it offers. Taylor stressed the progressively darker tone of the books, shown by the murder of a classmate and close friend and the psychological wounds and social isolation each causes. Taylor also argued that Philosopher's Stone, said to be the most light-hearted of the seven published books, disrupts the childhood reassurances that Byatt claims spur the series' success: the book opens with news of a double murder, for example.|$|E
2500|$|In 1944, Jones {{wrote to}} John Walvoord of Dallas Theological Seminary {{that while the}} {{university}} had [...] "no objection to educational work highly standardized…. We, however, cannot conscientiously let some group of educational experts or some committee of experts who may have a behavioristic or atheistic slant on education control or even influence the administrative policies of our college." [...] Five years later, Jones reflected that [...] "it cost us something {{to stay out of}} an association, but we stayed out. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> up to our convictions." [...] In any case, lack of accreditation seems to have made little difference during the post-war period, when the university more than doubled in size.|$|E

5000|$|Hanson {{was born}} in Utica, New York, on May 9, 1934 and moved to Miami, Florida, as a child. She {{graduated}} from Miami Senior High School. Hanson then moved around the state, living in Miami, Jacksonville, Fort Lauderdale, and Hollywood. In 1960, Hanson moved from Hollywood to Boca Raton due to her husband, Hank's, job transfer by his employer, Southern Bell. Hanson, who was a young mother of 2 children at the time, has described herself as initially very unhappy about the family's relocation to Boca Raton, [...] "I was in tears because <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> in Fort Lauderdale. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> in Hollywood. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> in Jacksonville. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> always been in big cities...I mean, I just stayed in tears." ...|$|R

2500|$|... he {{conjugal}} love of Leonore appears, to {{the modern}} individual armed with realism and psychology, irremediably abstract and theoretical.... Now that political events in Germany have restored to the concepts of human dignity and liberty their original significance, this is the opera which, {{thanks to the music}} of Beethoven, gives us comfort and courage.... Certainly, Fidelio is not an opera in the sense we are used to, nor is Beethoven a musician for the theater, or a dramaturgist. He is quite a bit more, a whole musician, and beyond that, a saint and a visionary. That which disturbs us is not a material effect, nor the fact of the 'imprisonment'; any film could create the same effect. No, it is the music, it is Beethoven himself. It is this 'nostalgia of liberty' he feels, or better, makes us feel; this is what moves us to tears. His Fidelio has more of the Mass than of the Opera to it; the sentiments it expresses come from the sphere of the sacred, and preach a 'religion of humanity' which we never found so beautiful or necessary as we do today, after all <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived</b> through. Herein lies the singular power of this unique opera.... Independent of any historical consideration ... the flaming message of Fidelio touches deeply.|$|E
2500|$|Boat 8 {{was loaded}} with 28 people under the {{supervision}} of Second Officer Lightoller and launched at about 1:00a.m., with Captain Smith and Chief Officer Wilde participating. Boat 8 was the first lifeboat on the port side to be lowered. Ida Straus, wife of New York merchant Isidor Straus, was asked to join a group of people preparing to board but refused, saying, [...] "I will not be separated from my husband. As <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>lived,</b> so will we die– together." [...] The 67-year-old Isidor likewise refused an offer to board on account of his age, saying: [...] "I do not wish any distinction in my favor which is not granted to others." [...] They were last seen alive on deck arm in arm. Major Archibald Butt, military aide to US President William Howard Taft, escorted to the boat Marie Young, a former music teacher to the children of President Theodore Roosevelt. She later recalled he [...] "wrapped blankets about me and tucked me in as carefully as if we were going on a motor ride." [...] He wished her farewell and good luck, asking her to [...] "remember me to the folks back home." [...] Other single women were brought to the boats by men who had earlier offered their services to [...] "unprotected ladies," [...] as the conventions of the era dictated.|$|E
