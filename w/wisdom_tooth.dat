5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower <b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth</b> is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper <b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth</b> also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E
5|$|Pulpitis is {{classified}} as reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts {{for a short time}} after a stimulus (for instance, cold or sweet); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower <b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth,</b> and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary sinusitis, which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or angina pectoris, which can cause pain in the lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|Pierce's 1954 {{season was}} {{interrupted}} when he reported {{pain in his}} left arm in a May 25 win over Cleveland; after several days of difficulty in determining the problem, he had oral surgery to remove an infected <b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth</b> and adjacent molar on June 3. He did not pitch again until June 20, but a lack of arm strength caused him to be ineffective in that start before slowly coming back with two relief appearances and another poor start, finally picking up wins with consecutive 3â€“0 shutouts on July 5 and 11, the latter being his fourth career two-hitter. It was later reported that the tooth problem had possibly existed as early as spring training, when Pierce initially suffered arm problems. But although he recorded only nine wins that season, {{he was one of}} just four pitchers to defeat the Indians three times as they racked up a league-record 111 victories, after also having been one of four pitchers to defeat the champion Yankees four times in 1953.|$|E
25|$|Few {{studies have}} looked at the {{percentage}} of the time <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> are present or the rate of <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> eruption. The lack of up to five teeth (excluding third molars, i.e. <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth)</b> is termed hypodontia. Missing third molars occur in 9-30% of studied populations.|$|R

25|$|The {{characteristics}} of the lower jaw are therefore {{the lack of a}} chin {{on the one hand and}} on the other it is the considerable size of the lower jaw bone, on which, behind the <b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth</b> a fourth premolar would easily have had space to develop. Since the third molar (the <b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth)</b> is present and its dentin exposed - although only in a few places - the age of death is estimated to be about 20 to 30 years.|$|E

25|$|Food {{can also}} become stuck between the <b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth</b> and the tooth in front, termed food packing, and cause acute {{inflammation}} in a periodontal pocket when the bacteria become trapped. A periodontal abscess may even form by this mechanism.|$|E
25|$|For {{partially}} impacted {{teeth in}} those over 20 year of age, {{the most common}} pathology seen, and the most common reason for wisdom teeth removal, is pericoronitis or infection of the gum tissue over the impacted tooth. The bacteria associated with infections include Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium, and Bacteroides bacteria. The next most common pathology seen is cavities or tooth decay. Fifteen percent of people with retained wisdom teeth exposed to the mouth have cavities on the <b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth</b> or adjacent second molar due to a <b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth.</b> The rate of cavities {{on the back of}} the second molar has been reported anywhere from 1% to 19% with the wide variation attributed to increased age.|$|E
25|$|Ramus {{fractures}} {{are said}} to involve a region inferiorly bounded by an oblique line extending from the lower third molar (<b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth)</b> region to the posteroinferior attachment of the masseter muscle, and {{which could not be}} better classified as either condylar or coronoid fractures.|$|E
2500|$|Prevention of pericoronitis can be {{achieved}} by removing impacted third molars before they erupt into the mouth, or through preemptive operculectomy. [...] A treatment controversy exists about the necessity and timing of the removal of asymptomatic, disease-free impacted <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> which prevents pericoronitis. Proponents of early extraction cite the cumulative risk for extraction over time, the high probability that <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> will eventually decay or develop gum disease and costs of monitoring to retained <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth.</b> Advocates for retaining <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> cite the risk and costs of unnecessary operations and the ability to monitor the disease through clinical exam and radiographs.|$|R
25|$|<b>Wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> likely become {{impacted}} {{because of}} a mismatch between {{the size of the}} teeth {{and the size of the}} jaw. Impacted <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> are classified by their direction of impaction, their depth compared to the biting surface of adjacent teeth and the amount of the tooth's crown that extends through gum tissue or bone. Impacted <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> can also be classified by the presence or absence of symptoms and disease. Screening for the presence of <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> often begins in late adolescence when a partially developed tooth may become impacted. Screening commonly includes clinical examination as well as x-rays such as panoramic radiographs.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this survey}} was to {{investigate}} conditions associated with <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> before extraction, the experience of pain and perceived reasons for removal, all from a patient perspective. Data were collected through questionnaires at a private dental clinic. Pain associated with <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> was frequent. More men than women experienced pain related to <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth.</b> A {{majority of the participants}} experienced pain between the age of 16 - 35 years, and most frequently in the lower jaw. The most common treatment of symptomatic <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> was extraction. A few participants received treatment before extraction, and antibiotics were then the most frequently used type of treatment. Lack of space was the most frequently perceived as reason for removal. The tendency to have the <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> removed increased with increased level of education, but showed no association with work situation or income. Some inconsistent answers were recorded, and the results must therefore be interpreted with caution...|$|R
25|$|Teeth are {{numbered}} starting at 1 in each group. Thus the human teeth are I1, I2, C1, P3, P4, M1, M2, and M3. (See next paragraph for premolar naming etymology.) In humans, the third molar {{is known as}} the <b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth,</b> whether or not it has erupted.|$|E
25|$|Dental caries (tooth decay) of the <b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth</b> and of {{the distal}} surface of the second molar is common. Tooth decay may cause pulpitis (toothache) {{to occur in the}} same region, and this may cause pulp {{necrosis}} and the formation of a periapical abscess associated with either tooth.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of impaction {{can be made}} clinically if enough of the <b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth</b> is visible to determine its angulation, depth, and if the patient is old enough that further eruption or uprighting is unlikely. Wisdom teeth continue to move into adulthood (20â€“30 years old) due to eruption and then continue some later movement owing to periodontal disease.|$|E
25|$|Impacted <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> {{without a}} {{communication}} to the mouth, {{that have no}} pathology associated with the tooth and have not caused tooth resorption on the blocking tooth rarely have symptoms. In fact, only 12% of impacted <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> are associated with pathology.|$|R
25|$|Many {{impacted}} <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> are extracted {{prior to}} the age of 25, when full eruption can be reasonably expected and before symptoms or disease have begun. This has led to a treatment controversy generally referred to as the extraction of asymptomatic, disease-free <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{angle of}} the {{mandible}} refers to the angle created by {{the arrangement of the}} body of the mandible and the ramus. Angle fractures are defined as those that involve a triangular region bounded by the anterior border of masseter muscle and an oblique line extending from the lower third molar (<b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth)</b> region to the posteroinferior attachment of the masseter muscle.|$|E
25|$|Pericoronitis {{is caused}} by an {{accumulation}} of bacteria and debris beneath the operculum, or by mechanical trauma (e.g. biting the operculum with the opposing tooth). Pericoronitis {{is often associated with}} partially erupted and impacted mandibular third molars (lower wisdom teeth), often occurring at the age of <b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth</b> eruption (15-24). Other common causes of similar pain from the third molar region are food impaction causing periodontal pain, pulpitis from dental caries (tooth decay), and acute myofascial pain in temporomandibular joint disorder.|$|E
25|$|Infection {{resulting}} from impacted wisdom teeth can be initially treated with antibiotics, local debridement or soft tissue surgery of the gum tissue overlying the tooth. Over time, {{most of these}} treatments tend to fail and patients develop recurrent symptoms. The most common treatment is <b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth</b> removal. The risks of <b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth</b> removal are roughly proportional {{to the difficulty of}} the extraction. Sometimes, when there is a high risk to the inferior alveolar nerve, only the crown of the tooth will be removed (intentionally leaving the roots) in a procedure called a coronectomy. The long-term risk of coronectomy is that chronic infection can persist from the tooth remnants. The prognosis for the second molar is good following the wisdom teeth removal with the likelihood of bone loss after surgery increased when the extractions are completed in people who are 25 years of age or older. A treatment controversy exists about the need for and timing of the removal of disease-free impacted wisdom teeth that are not causing problems. Supporters of early removal cite the increasing risks for extraction over time and the costs of monitoring the wisdom teeth that are not removed. Supporters for retaining wisdom teeth cite the risk and cost of unnecessary surgery.|$|E
2500|$|There is no {{standard}} {{to screen for}} <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth.</b> It has been suggested, absent evidence to support routinely retaining or removing <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth,</b> that evaluation with panoramic radiograph, starting {{between the ages of}} 16 and 25 be completed every 3 years. Once there is the possibility of the teeth developing disease, then a discussion about the operative risks versus long-term risk of retention with an oral and maxillofacial surgeon or other clinician trained to evaluate <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> is recommended. These recommendations are based on expert opinion level evidence. Screening at a younger age may be required if the second molars (the [...] "12-year molars") fail to erupt as ectopic positioning of the <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> can prevent their eruption. Radiographs can be avoided if the majority of the tooth is visible in the mouth.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prophylactic}} {{removal of}} asymptomatic impacted <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> {{is defined as}} the (surgical) removal of <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> in the absence of local disease. Impacted <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> may be associated with pathological changes, such as inflammation of the gums around the tooth, root resorption, gum and alveolar bone disease, damage to the adjacent teeth and the development of cysts and tumours. Other reasons to justify prophylactic removal have been to prevent late incisor crowding. When surgical removal is carried out in older patients, following the development of symptoms, the risk of postoperative complications, pain and discomfort increases. Nevertheless, in most developed countries prophylactic removal of trouble-free <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth,</b> either impacted or fully erupted, has long been considered as 'appropriate care' and is a very common procedure. There is a need to determine whether there is evidence to support this practice. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of prophylactic removal of asymptomatic impacted <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> in adolescents and adults compared with the retention (conservative management) of these <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth.</b> SEARCH METHODS: The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 30 March 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 30 March 2012), and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 30 March 2012). There were no restrictions on language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on adolescents and adults comparing the effect of prophylactic removal of asymptomatic impacted <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> with no-treatment (retention). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Six review authors screened the results of the search and assessed whether trials met the inclusion criteria for the review. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted in duplicate and independently by six review authors. Where information was unclear, authors of studies were contacted for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: No RCTs were identified that compared the removal of asymptomatic <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> with retention and reported quality of life. One RCT on adolescents was identified that compared the removal of impacted mandibular <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> with retention and only examined the effect on late lower incisor crowding. This study at high risk of bias provided no evidence that extraction of <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> had an effect on lower incisor crowding over 5 years. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient evidence was found to support or refute routine prophylactic removal of asymptomatic impacted <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> in adults. A single trial comparing removal versus retention found no evidence of a difference on late lower incisor crowding at 5 years, however no other relevant outcomes were measured. Watchful monitoring of asymptomatic third molar teeth may be a more prudent strategy...|$|R

25|$|One {{large scale}} study {{on a group}} of young adults in New Zealand showed 95.6% had at least 1 <b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth</b> with an {{eruption}} rate of 15% in the maxilla and 20% in the mandible. Another study on 5000 army recruits found 10,767 impacted wisdom teeth. The frequency of impacted lower third molars {{has been found to be}} 72% and the frequency of retained impacted wisdom teeth that are free of disease and symptoms is estimated at 11.6% to 29% which drops with age.|$|E
25|$|When wisdom teeth {{communicate}} with the mouth, the most common symptom is localized pain, swelling and bleeding of the tissue overlying the tooth. This tissue is called the operculum and the disorder called pericoronitis which means inflammation around the crown of the tooth. Low grade chronic periodontitis commonly occurs on either the <b>wisdom</b> <b>tooth</b> or the second molar, causing less obvious symptoms such as bad breath and bleeding from the gums. The teeth can also remain asymptomatic (pain free), even with disease. As the teeth near the mouth during normal development, people sometimes report mild pressure of other symptoms similar to teething.|$|E

5000|$|There {{has been}} much debate over Magdalenian Girl's age due to her {{impacted}} <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth.</b> According to Science Daily, impaction during the Stone Age was unknown because of the coarse diet of the period. This diet would have required more chewing and higher bite forces which could result in more growth of the jawbone and thereby creating more room for <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> to erupt. According to Robert D. Martin, [...] "Finding impacted <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> 15,000 years ago indicates that the human diet might have already changed, some would say 'deteriorated,' earlier than previously thought." [...] Dr. Martin, along with Dr. William Pestle, Field Museum Collection Manager, Drs. Michael Colvard and Richard Jurevic of the College of Dentistry at the University of Illinois at Chicago studied the impacted <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> {{and came to the}} conclusion that she was employing new tools and technology.|$|R
25|$|Impacted <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> (or {{impacted}} third molars) are <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> {{which do}} not fully erupt into the mouth because of blockage from other teeth (impaction). If the <b>wisdom</b> <b>teeth</b> {{do not have an}} open connection to the mouth, pain can develop with the onset of inflammation or infection or damage to the adjacent teeth. Common accepted hypothesis that determine eruption is the angle at which the 3rd molars sit, the stage of root formation of 3rd molars at the point of screening, depth of impaction, how much room there is for eruption as well as the size of the 3rd molar.|$|R
