40|$|In {{addition}} to supporting mechanical loads, railroad wheels serve an important function as brake drums in freight car air brake systems. Railway wheel removals in service {{can be caused}} by many factors including tread <b>wear,</b> <b>flange</b> <b>wear,</b> improper use of the handbrake, defective air brakes, manufacturing defects, and various other reasons. Past reviews of Association of American Railroads (AAR) car repair billing (CRB) data show that many North American freight car wheel removals are for wheel/rail sliding-related defects such as spalling, slid flats, built-up-tread and out-of-round. In this paper, year 2001 wheel removal data for a fleet of coal cars owned by a major Midwestern utility are reviewed and compared. Differences between wheel removal data for steel and aluminum cars in the coal car fleet are discussed, with emphasis on possible causes. Also, differences between AAR CRB wheel removal data and wheel removal data for the coal car fleet are discussed, with emphasis on possible causes. Recommendations are also offered...|$|R

30|$|The most {{important}} part of the wheel to be affected by <b>wear</b> is the <b>flange</b> area, which is used to maintain dynamic stability of the vehicle and prevent its removal from the line. According to published reports from wear situation on the London Underground, the factors affecting the deterioration flange, the most effective agent, are moving in severe arches [27]. The severity of wear is to the extent that the <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> is reduced 16 – 21 times only by using appropriate lubrication in arches.|$|R
50|$|The {{circular}} {{nature of}} the Mulberry Island and James River subdivisions meant that the running of trains would concentrate <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> on the outer wheels of cars and locomotives. To minimize excessive and uneven <b>flange</b> <b>wear,</b> all of the FEMRR rolling stock had to be turned through the wye each quarter. Every piece of rolling stock on the railroad had a red disc painted on one side, about 18 inches from the right end of the equipment as seen from that side. During {{the first two weeks}} of each calendar quarter, all rolling stock was moved through the wye to reverse the orientation of the equipment.|$|R

50|$|During the 1970s doctor Herbert Scheffel of the SAR {{experimented with}} {{self-steering}} bogies {{which not only}} reduced <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> on goods wagons, but also opened up the possibility of running at high speed in passenger service on Cape gauge.|$|R
50|$|During 1937, the Class 16C engines were {{fitted with}} Stone-Deuta speed indicators. As built, the second coupled axle had {{flangeless}} wheels, {{but these were}} later retyred with flanges to obtain better distribution of tyre <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> and improved running.|$|R
50|$|The minimum {{curve radius}} that the {{locomotives}} can negotiate is : any curve tighter than this could cause severe <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> on the wheels. In order to reduce flange forces, the bogies are linked by a tubular-framed spring-loaded inter-coupling and flange lubricators are fitted to each wheel.|$|R
50|$|Bogies {{for the new}} {{locomotives}} were of Bo-Bo-Bo wheel arrangement. This {{differed from}} the diesel-electrics of the day which had Co-Co wheel arrangement.

40|$|Rail {{and rail}} wheel <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> {{on the rail}} track {{has been a problem}} of {{attention}} for the last 30 years. The problems arise in curves and depend on increased traffic volume, heavier axle load and also higher speed. Axle loads of 22, 5 - 25 ton is common nowadays and the trend is towards heavier axle loads where the next step is 30 - 35 ton. <b>Flange</b> <b>wear</b> includes both wheel and rail flanges and is therefore a problem for the operating company as well as the infrastructure owner. The <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> depend mainly on the number of passed axles, type of traffic, speed and curve radius but also the axle load contributes. Flange lubrication on high rail is a well known way to reduce wear since the middle of 70 th and a number of techniques to lubricate the rail flange are developed as grease, aerosol of oil and dry stick with solid lubricants. The trackside lubricator can not apply the grease on the rail flange when the climate is during the winter. The infrastructure owner in Sweden was interested {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the track side lubricator. The investment in trackside lubricators over 20 years was about 75 Mkr (7, 6 USD) and also an additional yearly costs to operate 3000 apparatuses. The work to evaluate effectiveness of the lubrication started 1997 there one of the important matter concern the possibility to use environmentally adapted lubricants without hazard the rail. This licentiate thesis concern effectiveness of trackside lubricators to reduce wear in sharp railroad curves. Also the environmentally aspects have been considered and therefore natural esters synthetic esters and additives suited for those kind of lubricants have been evaluated. The research proved that environmentally adapted lubricants could lubricate as good as earlier used greases. Some amount of metal removal is probably healthy for this kind of application. Lubricants as synthetic esters can be designed get those qualities. It was also found significant difference between the seasons concerning <b>flange</b> <b>wear.</b> This difference depends on the problem to apply grease on the rail flange during the winter...|$|R
50|$|During the trials, the {{locomotive}} gave some trouble due to broken plate frames {{on the engine}} units {{and it was also}} found that the absence of trailing carrying wheels on the engine units was a disadvantage since it led to excessive <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> on the coupled wheels. As a result, no. 2140 remained the only representative of its Class. All subsequent Garratt models of the SAR were equipped with trailing Bissel trucks.|$|R
50|$|The ECR was {{the first}} railway company to use a two-wheel pony truck, in 1859, using the design of American {{inventor}} Levi Bissell. This innovation was patented in the USA on November 2, 1858 and on 1 December 1858 in Great Britain. In the summer of 1859 the ECR fitted the truck to locomotive 248, a Kitsons built 2-4-0 of 1855, and {{it was reported that}} the ride of the locomotive was improved and wheel <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> noticeably reduced.|$|R
50|$|The {{distance}} between the locomotive's tyres, i.e. between the wheel flanges on the axle, was 3 ft. This was 3/8 in greater than for engines of the Cape Government Railways and Natal Government Railways and, although the flanges were somewhat thinner, the resulting tightness to gauge was blamed for the rather high rate of <b>flange</b> <b>wear.</b> To obtain greater life from the leading coupled wheels, they were occasionally exchanged with the trailing coupled wheels during overhauls.|$|R
50|$|The {{terminal}} {{is located}} {{at the end of a}} loop connected to the route from the tunnel; trains exiting the tunnel travel anti-clockwise around this loop and then pull into the terminal, meaning the locomotive that pulled the train will remain at the front for the next service through the tunnel. The terminal at Cheriton also has a loop arrangement, but instead trains travel clockwise; this is intended to ensure equal <b>wear</b> on the <b>flange</b> of the wheels.|$|R
50|$|With the {{development}} of mining operations {{in the northern part}} of Korea, traffic volumes increased significantly, and Sentetsu found a need for a locomotive with strong pulling power suitable for use on mountainous lines with sharp curves and steep slopes. The locomotive designed in response to this need was not of the Mika type, which was Sentetsu's standard freight locomotive, but of the Mate type with 4-8-2 wheel arrangement; the leading bogie was designed to reduce <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> on the wheels. The resulting Matei class locomotives became a mainstay on long-distance freight trains on mountainous lines.|$|R

In 1875 a second locomotive (no. 7) was similarly rebuilt, although this {{seems to have been}} a trial for new features adopted for the Skye bogies.

50|$|On the Modified Fairlie, as {{compared}} to the Double Fairlie, the distance between the engine units had been increased to a figure {{similar to that of the}} Garratt type, thereby allowing space between them for a liberal firebox and ashpan. This resulted in a more efficient boiler and also distributed the weight of the engine over a greater length than was obtainable with an orthodox Double Fairlie design. It was claimed that the Modified Fairlie arrangement reduced the <b>wear</b> between wheel <b>flanges</b> and rails and that the distribution of the loads on the axles as fuel and water was expended was less variable than could be obtained with the Garratt design.|$|R

The dynamic {{performance}} of the train under the longitudinal coupler press force was simulated. The wheel/rail lateral force and wheel <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> were analyses. Simulation results shown that the front locomotive will suffer a big longitudinal press force for the delay of the brake force transfer; this will lead {{the rotation of the}} coupler. The lateral force will apply to the car body at the position of coupler, which was caused by the longitudinal coupler force and the rotation angle of the coupler, then the wheel <b>flange</b> partial <b>wear</b> were induced as a result...|$|R
5000|$|The second batch, {{numbered}} 142015-142027, {{was delivered}} {{for use in}} the West Country. These units, named [...] "Skippers", went straight to Plymouth Laira depot for use on branch-line services in Devon and Cornwall, although their success on these duties was hindered by their lack of bogies. Their long wheelbase caused heavy <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> when they were negotiating the tight curves of the West Country branch lines, as well as producing loud screeching sounds. Adhesion problems were also encountered by the lightweight 'Skippers' when tackling the gradients of the Gunnislake, St Ives and Looe branches. For a time, consideration was given to fitting sanding equipment and lubricators to the 'Skippers' but this was rejected in favour of transferring the class north to Neville Hill (Leeds) and Newton Heath (Manchester) depots in 1988/89.|$|R
40|$|The {{conditions}} at the wheel/rail contact have a dramatic impact on safety, ride quality and cost of maintenance.

40|$|Wear of {{railroad}} rolling stock and rails costs {{millions of dollars}} each year in all rail systems throughout the world. The rail industry has attempted to address <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> using lubricants. The choice of rail curve lubricant is currently not based on a standards approach. Measuring rail curve lubricant performance in a laboratory environment can address this information shortfall and reduce wear in rail rolling stock and infrastructure. The equipment used to measure rail curve lubricant performance consists of two dissimilar disks, of matching contact profile, rotating in contact with one another. The outcome from the modifications was the ability to quantify rail curve lubricant performance using three performance criteria and to measure the changes in apparent viscosity with respect to accumulated strain damage. This paper will provide {{a description of the}} equipment and modifications to the rail / wheel wear simulator and preliminary results to display the outcomes of the modifications...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of trains used at {{high speeds}} for transporting men along mine railways is examined using a number of mathematical models. These models predict the responses of different rail vehicles to typical irregularities in the track, and are {{used to examine the}} guidance, the ride, and the likelihood of derailment of the main classes of manriding trains used in British coal mines. The outcome of the modelling compares favourably with the results of tests carried out on actual vehicles. The investigation has shown that the safe speed at which trains may operate is ultimately restricted by the condition of the track, but changes {{in the design of the}} vehicles can lead to an improved performance. The use of conventional wheelsets, for example, can reduce <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> significantly and so allows higher speeds to be reached. Guidelines for the design of vehicles intended for high speed use are included in this thesis...|$|R
50|$|The {{class were}} {{widely used in}} Devon and Cornwall where the track had many sharp curves. It was found that <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> on the leading driving wheels became {{excessive}} {{as a result of}} these bends. In November and December 1927 additional weight was added to the front end of four examples so that the pony truck would be forced to impart more side thrust to the main frames on bends. These locomotives reverted to their original state, but between January and March 1928, 65 engines of 5300 series received additional weight on the pony truck, and 3000 was added to their running numbers, temporarily creating an ‘8300 Class’. However, the additional weight placed them in the Red category of route availability. From 1944 onwards there was a shortage of locomotives in the Blue category and so the additional weights were removed and the surviving locomotives resumed their original running numbers. The last to be returned to its original condition was 8393 in September 1948.|$|R
40|$|When {{designing}} and optimizing a rail vehicle {{there is a}} contradiction between, on the one hand, stability on straight track at high speed and, on the other hand, reasonable wheel and rail wear in small- and medium radius curves. Higher speeds require to some extent stiffer wheelset guidance to avoid hunting and ensure stability. However, with stiffer wheelset guidance the risk of increased wheel and rail wear in curves is imminent. In this paper, {{the process of developing}} and optimizing a track-friendly bogie is described. A multi-body system (MBS) simulation model was used, taking due consideration to nonlinearities in suspension and wheel-rail contact, as well as realistic flexibilities in the track. Adequate and systematic consideration is taken {{to a wide range of}} possible non-linear wheel-rail combinations. Dynamic stability is investigated both on straight track and in wide curves at high speeds. The balance between <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> and tread wear is studied in order to maximize wheel life between re-profiling operations in the intended average operation. The result is a bogie with relatively soft wheelset guidance allowing passive radial self-steering, which in combination with appropriate yaw damping ensures stability on straight track at higher speeds. The bogie has been subject to both certification testing and long-term service testing in the Gröna Tåget (the Green Train) research and development programme. 1...|$|R
40|$|Steering bogies and {{actively}} steered bogies {{are subjected to}} increasing interest. Self-steering bogies {{have been used in}} large numbers of hauling locomotives primarily in the USA to reduce <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> and improve adhesion. However, the steering performance of self-steering bogies is reported to deteriorate under traction. This article compares several bogie types and proposes a new design of steering bogie featuring forced steering combined with control of the bogie yaw movement or actuated yaw forced steered bogie (AY-FS). The bogie stability of a force steered bogie is improved by yaw actuation using a negative derivative control of the bogie yaw misalignment. An additional benefit of the bogie design is that actuators and control sensors for the AY-FS bogie can be mounted on the vehicle body rather than on the bogie frame. The article presents simulation results for a yaw actuated force steered bogie under traction curving conditions. The AY-FS bogie is compared with rigid and force steered bogies and is shown to give superior performance at high traction adhesion levels during curving. The curving performance improvements achieved depend on the curvature, lateral forces on the vehicle, the traction load, and the rail friction. The greatest curving performance advantages occur in tighter curvatures with high traction loads and low rail friction and with high lateral forces to the inside rail such as would result from coupler loads on pulling locomotives...|$|R
25|$|All {{locomotives}} were inherited by British Railways in 1948, {{and from}} 1955, {{several members of}} the class received new chimneys of the British Railways Standard Class 4 variety and replacement cylinders, which had become worn through intensive use. No major redesign of the front-end of the U1 class was required, with all the steam passages fully streamlined as a result of experience with the previous five Maunsell designs. The U1 Class members working on the Hastings route were subjected to excess <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> because of the tight curves, a problem also experienced when used on the network west of Exeter, when the aging T9 class 4-4-0 locomotives designed by Dugald Drummond were finally withdrawn from service in the early 1960s. The locomotive crews of the area took a dislike to the U1 in preference to the smaller-wheeled N class, which performed better on the steeper gradients found {{in this part of the}} railway network. With the electrification of the Kentish main lines of the Eastern section, the amount of work that required the U1 class' route availability advantage was reduced, and the class was congregated at Stewarts Lane shed in London. The majority of the class was withdrawn from service in 1962, with the final three (including the prototype) gone by June 1963, outlasting their N1 class siblings by one year. Having been replaced by Bulleid’s Light Pacifics, no members of the U1 class were preserved.|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} part of maintenance costs in urban rail systems (metro, tram, light rapid transit/light metro) is due to wheel-rail wear. Wear rates - measured for example as depth of wear per kilometre run (rolling stock) or per train passage (rails) - depend in a complex manner on several influence factors. Among the most important are key design factors of the rolling stock (wheel profiles, suspension characteristics), of the track (distribution of curve radii, characteristics of switches and crossings, rail profiles), of the wheel-rail interface (lubrication, materials in contact, ambient characteristics), and of operations (frequency of traction and braking, trainset inversion policy, maintenance policy etc.). When designing an urban rail system, {{all of these factors}} have to be under control in order to limit the costs due to wheel/rail reprofiling/grinding and replacement. The state of the art allows the calculation of wear rates given quantitative input regarding the above factors. However, it is difficult to find in the literature experimental values for calibration of wear models and indications on what is a reasonable state-of-the-art wear rate for any given type of urban rail system. In this paper we present a structured analysis of <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> rates found in the literature and derived from the experience of the authors, for a variety of cases, including metros and mainline rail systems. We compare the wear rates and explain their relationship with the influence factors. We then relate the wear rates with the needs in terms of wheel reprofiling/replacement. We estimate ranges for the calibration coefficients of wear models. We present the results in a way as to allow the designer of urban rail systems to derive values for target wear rates according to their specific conditions without the need for complex simulations...|$|R
40|$|Amtrak's Northeast {{corridor}} (NEC), with 150 mph Acela {{passenger trains}} operating on tracks shared with much slower and heavier freight trains, places unique {{demands on the}} wheel/rail system. The traffic mix runs the gamut between slow moving heavy axle load trains operating at considerable under-balanced elevations and high speed trains running at up to 7 inches of cant deficiency over an alignment far more curved than any other high speed corridor around the world. This poses a particularly challenging maintenance environment in which to operate a high-speed service. Among its many efforts to facilitate higher speeds and more efficient services on passenger lines, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has initiated a landmark project to help Amtrak engineer the wheel/rail interaction on the NEC for improved safety, ride quality and lower maintenance costs. This paper reports on the improved curved-rail profiles that {{have been designed to}} maximize the effectiveness of limited rail grinding resources during the 2002 grinding cycle. It reports on an alternate wheel profile that will soon be tested for its ability to reduce <b>flange</b> <b>wear</b> on the high-speed Acela vehicles and for its impact on stability, wheel climb, wear and contact fatigue. Beyond the important safety implications of this program, Amtrak is working to apply the findings to improve system reliability and to maximize the cost effectiveness of wheel and rail maintenance. The paper discusses maintenance management in general and reports on a wheel/rail management system being developed jointly between Amtrak and the National Research Council of Canada. This system will perform an integrated engineering analysis of an increasing number of data streams (e. g. measured rail and wheel profiles, track alignment and geometry measurements, and vehicle performance data) to provide guidance on wheel and rail maintenance policies and practices.

40|$|In this thesis, wheel/rail {{interface}} optimisation, {{and particularly}} the problems of wheel and rail profile design are considered. The research task pursued by this thesis engenders investigation {{of a range of}} problems. First, geometric properties of contact between wheel and rail are investigated. Then, physical properties of rolling contact between wheel and rail are studied with the help of contact mechanics. Railway vehicle dynamics are then considered using multibody dynamic approach. Finally, a numerical optimisation method is used for the design of the wheel profile. All these disciplines are combined in one wheel (rail) profile design procedure. The wheel (rail) profile design procedure is developed with the idea that the rolling radius difference (RRD) function, to a large extent, describes the wheel/rail contact properties. Therefore, for a known optimal RRD function, a wheel profile that delivers the required contact properties defined by this RRD can be determined. Wheel and rail profile measurements are used to analyse wheelset contact properties in order to design the target RRD function. The problem of finding a wheel profile corresponding to the target RRD function is formulated as an optimisation problem. The dynamic performance of a vehicle with the designed wheel profile is tested for stability, wear, and dynamic contact stresses using the ADAMS/Rail computer package. In this research, three railway system types are considered - tram, metro, and conventional railway. Using the developed design procedure, new wheel profiles are designed for each above mentioned case, solving for, respectively, the problems of <b>flange</b> <b>wear,</b> stability (as a result of excessive tread wear), and RCF. In the first two cases, wheel profiles were successfully implemented on the respective networks.

To find the ways {{to solve this problem}} comparing the locomotive designs and their operating conditions. Findings. After examining the nature of the wheel wear the main difference was found: in locomotives of the 2 M 62 line <b>wears</b> the wheel <b>flange,</b> and in the locomotives SIEMENS ER 20 CF – the tread surface. After installation on the 2 M 62 locomotive the lubrication system of <b>flanges</b> their <b>wear</b> rate significantly decreased. On the new freight locomotives SIEMENS ER 20 CF the flange lubrication systems of the wheel set have been already installed at the factory, however the wheel thread is wearing. As for locomotives 2 M 62, and on locomotives SIEMENS ER 20 CF most wear profile skating wheels of the first wheel set. On both locomotive lines the 2 М 62 and the SIEMENS ER 20 CF the tread profile of the first wheel set most of all is subject to the wear. After reaching the 170 000 km run, the tread surface of some wheels begins to crumble. There was a suspicion that the reason for crumb formation of the wheel surface may be insufficient or excessive wheel hardness or its chemical composition. In order to confirm or deny this suspicion the following studies were conducted: the examination of the rim surface, the study of the wheel metal hardness and the document analysis of the wheel production and their comparison with the results of wheel hardness measurement. Practical value. The technical condition of locomotives is one of the bases of safety and reliability of the rolling stock. The reduction of the wheel wear significantly reduces the operating costs of railway transport. After study completion it was found that there was no evidence to suggest that the ratio of the wheel-rail hardness could be the cause of the wheel surface crumbling...|$|R
40|$|The worn wheel {{profiles}} {{generated by}} uni-directional wagon travel produce different profile shapes {{on the leading}} and trailing wheelsets of each bogie. In the case examined both leading and trailing wheels wear to profiles having greater effective wheel conicity. The leading <b>worn</b> wheels exhibit <b>flange</b> and tread <b>wear</b> and the worn profile has highly non-linear conicity having little vertical displacement over the middle range of lateral displacement. A large vertical displacement is still achieved by the worn leading wheel profile in the last section of the flangeway clearance. The worn trailing wheels have only tread wear with near linear effective conicity across the flangeway. The hunting instability performances of the vehicle with the uni-directional wheel wear profiles is shown {{to have a higher}} critical speed than new wheel profiles due to the mismatch of the leading and trailing wheel profiles. The leading wheels of the bogie hunt with a wavelength of 26 - 30 m whilst the trailing wheels hunt at a wavelength of 12 - 16 m. Because of the differing frequency responses in the front and rear wheelsets of each bogie, lateral instability is damped for the worn wheel profiles. The worn profiles’ curving performance is also improved due to increases in the total profile conicity. Individually the leading wheel worn profile with its non-linear conicity across the flangeway has lower critical speed than a new wheel profile, the non-linear shape leading to chaotic lateral instability. The trailing wheel profile with its highly linear conicity across the middle of the flangeway has classic sinusoidal hunting at a much reduced critical speed and much reduced wavelength. The worn wheel profiles by themselves for both leading wheel and trailing wheel are found to have critical speeds 80 % of the new wheel profile critical speed. In combination as found in a wagon operating in one direction, the leading and trailing wheel profiles produce a critical hunting speed 125 % of the new wheel profiles’ critical hunting speed...|$|R
