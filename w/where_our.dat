25|$|The {{amount of}} {{extinction}} can be {{significantly higher than}} this in specific directions. For example, some regions of the Galactic Center have more than 30 magnitudes of extinction in the optical, meaning that less than 1 optical photon in 1012 passes through. This results in the so-called zone of avoidance, <b>where</b> <b>our</b> view of the extra-galactic sky is severely hampered, and background galaxies, such as Dwingeloo 1, were only discovered recently through observations in radio and infrared.|$|E

The more I think about it, the more it's a desecration of our Indian culture. Not just Crazy Horse, but all of us.|$|E

Zack Snyder wanted the film to [...] "appear very natural because there’s some very fantastical things in there and he wanted people to suspend their disbelief, and we the visual effects team {{had to make it}} as easy as possible for them to do so." [...] Desjardin noted that the intent in shooting the film was to utilize handheld devices to make the film feel like a [...] "documentary-style" [...] film. [...] "We had to think about what that would mean, since we also had to photograph some crazy action," [...] said Desjardin. [...] "So {{for a lot of the}} previs we did, we’d start to think <b>where</b> <b>our</b> cameras were and <b>where</b> <b>our</b> cameraman was. A lot of the rules are the Battlestar Galactica rules for the space cams that Gary Hurtzel [...] developed for that miniseries, where we want to make sure if we're translating the camera at all it makes sense.

[...] The Oneida Whig did not approve of the convention, writing of the Declaration: [...] "This bolt is the most shocking and unnatural incident ever recorded in the history of womanity.

[...] But now there was [...] "a new understanding of the Arab 'street,'" [...] he wrote. [...] "We are beginning to understand why the powers that be wanted us to believe all those lies about [...]" [...] He said it had now become [...] "a place of righteousness and honor, beauty and justice... the space <b>where</b> <b>our</b> youth came of age, as they rebelled against injustice, abuse, and humiliation." ...|$|E

500|$|In his speeches, Morales {{presented}} the coca leaf {{as a symbol}} of Andean culture that was under threat from the imperialist oppression of the U.S. In his view, the U.S. should deal with their domestic cocaine abuse problems without interfering in Bolivia, arguing that they had no right trying to eliminate coca, a legitimate product with many uses which played a rich role in Andean culture. In a speech on this issue, Morales told reporters [...] "I am not a drug trafficker. I am a coca grower. I cultivate coca leaf, which is a natural product. I do not refine (it into) cocaine, and neither cocaine nor drugs have ever been part of the Andean culture." [...] On another, he asserted that [...] "We produce our coca, we bring it to the main markets, we sell it and that's <b>where</b> <b>our</b> responsibility ends." ...|$|E

Citing the power of alternate reality programs and video games, like Minecraft, Ingels' 'worldcraft' is an extension of 'hedonistic sustainability' and further develops ideas established in his first book, Yes Is More. In the video (and essay by the same name in his second book, Hot to Cold: An Odyssey of Architectural Adaptation) Ingels notes: [...] "These fictional worlds empower people with the tools to transform their own environments. This is what architecture ought to be..." [...] "Architecture must become Worldcraft, the craft of making our world, <b>where</b> <b>our</b> knowledge and technology doesn't limit us but rather enables us to turn surreal dreams into inhabitable space.

500|$|However, Wolcott Gibbs of The New Yorker {{called the}} musical [...] "a {{shocking}} disappointment". [...] Robert Garland, in the New York Journal American suggested that Rodgers and Hammerstein [...] "had confused allegro [...] with, say, lento, which means 'slow', 'unhurried', and even downright 'serious'". [...] Critic George Jean Nathan, {{in a special}} piece in the Journal American, decried [...] "such hokum mush as the familiar wedding scene and {{the ghost of a}} mother who returns at intervals to keep her son from error, but a cocktail party chatterbox number paraphrased from an old Noël Coward movie, a college number dittoed from an earlier George Abbott one, and various other elements hardly rivaling the daisy in freshness". [...] In Theatre Arts, Cecil Smith called Allegro [...] "acceptable only as an exercise in stagecraft, not as a work of art... Allegro fails <b>where</b> <b>Our</b> Town succeeded... Joseph Taylor, Jr.'s life has little or nothing to tell us about our own lives." [...] Louis Kronenberger of New York P.M. called the show [...] "an out-and-out failure." ...|$|E

Billy Johnson, Jr of Yahoo! Music wrote: [...] "Kenzo Digital, who spent a month creating Beyoncé's interactive video, told Yahoo!

[...] In a Yahoo! Amplified interview with Daniel Kreps, Digital said: [...] "It's just a bare white screen.
