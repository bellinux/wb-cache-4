2500|$|Morris never denied, indeed emphasized, {{that the}} {{ultimate}} objective of the Act was majority-based collective bargaining. Nevertheless, minority-union bargaining was always protected as a stepping-stone stage of bargaining that {{could be expected to}} lead to majority bargaining, which is exactly what happened during the decade following passage of the Act. [...] None of the facts reported by historian Tomlins, on whom one historical criticism was erroneously based indicated the contrary; indeed The Blue Eagle at <b>Work</b> <b>cited</b> Tomlins.|$|E

2500|$|Also in 1908, {{with her}} Viața Românească articles, Sadoveanu turned her {{attention}} to the impact of Symbolism and the anti-traditionalist Romanian Symbolist branch. As she herself argued decades later: [...] "I was the only one to express the opinion that [...] we are dealing with an innovative movement, just like I was the first one in history to sketch out Symbolism in articles for Viața Românească". According to various commentators of her <b>work,</b> <b>cited</b> by literary historian Paul Cernat, she was indeed the first Romanian to take an interest in the movement, and who therefore opened a channel of communication between the Poporanists and the Romanian Symbolists. This assessment is partly contradicted by researcher Angelo Mitchievici, who reviews earlier such essays written by Alexandru Bibescu and Elena Bacaloglu.|$|E
2500|$|Cthulhu Mythos scholar Robert M. Price {{claims the}} {{irregular}} sonnet The Kraken, written in 1830 by Alfred Tennyson, {{was a major}} inspiration for Lovecraft's story, as both reference a huge aquatic creature sleeping for an eternity {{at the bottom of}} the ocean and destined to emerge from its slumber in an apocalyptic age. Price also notes that Lovecraft admired the work of Lord Dunsany, who wrote The Gods of Pegana (1905), which depicts a god constantly lulled to sleep to avoid the consequences of its reawakening. Another Dunsany <b>work</b> <b>cited</b> by Price is A Shop in Go-by Street (1919), which stated [...] "the heaven of the gods who sleep", and [...] "unhappy are they that hear some old god speak while he sleeps being still deep in slumber".|$|E
60|$|From Australia, we have Mr. Howitt's {{account of}} the All Father in his Native Tribes of South-East Australia, with the {{account of the}} All Father of the Central Australian tribe, the Kaitish, in North Central Tribes of Australia, by Messrs.

Spencer and Gillen's <b>work</b> <b>cited,</b> and in their earlier Native Tribes of Central Australia, we are introduced to savages who offer an elaborate animistic theory, and are said to show no traces of the All Father belief.|$|E

60|$|This {{reference}} to Swedenborg is remarked upon by Schubert in his {{preface to the}} essay of Kant. He points out that 'it is interesting to compare the circumspection, the almost uncertainty of Kant {{when he had to}} deliver a judgment on the phenomena described by himself and as to which he had made inquiry [i.e. in his letter re Swedenborg to Mlle. de Knobloch], and the very decided opinions he expressed forty years later on Swedenborg and his companions' [in the <b>work</b> <b>cited,</b> sections 35-37. The opinion in paragraph 35 is a general one as to mystics. There is no other mention of Swedenborg].|$|E

It is worthy of note that the figure by no means bears out Gratiolet's description, inasmuch as the fissure (antero- temporal) on the posterior half of {{the face of the}} hemisphere is more marked than any of those vaguely indicated in the anterior half. If the figure is correct, it in no way justifies Gratiolet's conclusion: [...] "Il y a donc entre ces cerveaux [those of a Callithrix and of a Gibbon] et celui du foetus humain une difference fondamental. Chez celui-ci, longtemps avant que les plis temporaux apparaissent, les plis frontaux, ESSAYENT d'exister." ...|$|E
