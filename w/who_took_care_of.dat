5|$|The minor inmates at the Castellania {{were the}} ones <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the general maintenance, {{cleaning}} and repair works of the building, while guards {{were responsible for the}} allocation of tasks and observing their performance. Some historical graffiti made by prisoners {{can be found at the}} courtyard of the prison. At the underground are the dungeons, which are described as an unpleasant place to stay. By the early 19th century, arrested females awaiting a court decision started to be sent to the women prison at Corradino (now a police station) rather than accommodated at the Castellania.|$|E
5|$|Penelo {{is usually}} {{trying to keep}} Vaan out of trouble, {{but she could not}} stop Vaan from intruding into the palace grounds. She {{encountered}} Vaan, who was arrested along with Balthier and Fran. This encounter forced her into a series of events, when she was kidnapped by Bangaa headhunter Ba'gamnan and held as hostage in exchange for Balthier. When she managed to escape, she met with Larsa Solidor, one of the sons of Archadian Emperor Gramis, <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> her and convinced her he wished to make peace with Dalmasca. When she is finally reunited with Vaan, she made him promise not to leave her side, and ever since traveled with Vaan, furthering their relationship as sky pirate and partner.|$|E

5|$|In this {{situation}} one Ivaylo, {{a native of}} north-eastern Bulgaria, most likely the area near Provadia, began to incite the population to revolt. He was called by the contemporary Byzantine chroniclers by the name Bardokva (lettuce) or Lakhanas (vegetable) and his real name is known only from a note, attached to the Svarlig gospel. The Byzantine historian George Pachymeres stated {{that he was a}} swineherd <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> pigs for money. However, the historian John Fine notes that pigs were a major livestock product at the time and the possessor of a large herd could {{have been part of the}} elite of the local community. Ivaylo claimed that he had visions from God to lead the people and that he was in contact with heaven and the saints. In fact, his mysticism was deliberately used to swiftly gain support and followers among the religious villagers. He came to be seen by many Bulgarians as a God-given saviour.|$|E
5|$|The empress, {{the legal}} {{wife of the}} emperor, also had {{an area of the}} palace {{separate}} from that of the emperor's private apartments, where the empress was expected to spend every fifth night with the emperor. Both the empress and the heir apparent received an income from the taxes of forty counties. She also had a Supervisor of the Household (ranked 2,000-dan), and many other subordinates, either male eunuchs or female maids, <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> domestic needs. The concubines of the harem were subordinates of the empress and were ranked below her in fourteen grades by the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han (r. 49–33). However, the founder of Eastern Han abolished the fourteen salary-ranks in favor of three ranks with no definite salary; instead, the concubines were irregularly granted gifts. The chief concubine of Western Han, the Brilliant Companion, shared the same salary-rank as the Chancellor, while the concubine ranked just below her, the Favorite Beauty, shared the same salary-rank as any one of the Nine Ministers.|$|E

25|$|The great scholar led a {{perfectly}} ascetic life, devoting his entire time to studies, never touching money. His worldly needs {{were met by}} the head of the Prachar Ashram, Kanti Chandra Mitra. It was the latter <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the education of his two children. Prachar Ashram was a small establishment of Brahmo Samaj of India at Patuatola Lane in Kolkata, meant primarily for missionaries and their families, with a students’ hostel and a press in an adjacent building.|$|E
25|$|The last Byzantine emperor <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the {{aqueduct}} was Andronikos I Komnenos. Neither {{during the}} Latin Empire nor during the Palaiologan period were any repair works executed, {{but by that}} time the population of the city had shrunk to about 40,000–50,000 inhabitants, so that the water supply was no longer a very important issue. Nevertheless, according to Ruy Gonzáles de Clavijo, a Castilian diplomat who traveled to Constantinople en route to an embassy to Timur in 1403, the aqueduct was still functioning.|$|E
25|$|Indian {{influences}} {{came first}} with Shaivism and Buddhism penetrating deeply into society, blending with indigenous tradition and culture. One conduit for {{this were the}} ascetics, called resi, who taught mystical practices. A resi lived surrounded by students, <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> their master's daily needs. Resi's authorities were merely ceremonial. At the courts, Brahmin clerics and pudjangga (sacred literati) legitimised rulers and linked Hindu cosmology to their political needs. Small Hindu enclaves are scattered throughout Java, {{but there is a}} large Hindu population along the eastern coast nearest Bali, especially around the town of Banyuwangi.|$|E

25|$|While it {{is usually}} claimed that {{inverted}} honji suijaku was a reaction of native cults to the dominance of Buddhism, it also came out of Buddhist intellectualism. The theory is not per se anti-Buddhist and does not question the existence of buddhas but simply seeks to invert the established order of importance between kami and buddhas. Why Buddhists should develop such a theory {{to the detriment of}} their own divinities is unclear, but it is possible that it was developed by shrine monks, or shasō, <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the shrine part of temple-shrine complexes to enhance their status.|$|E
25|$|The {{iconography}} of Kartikeya varies significantly; he is typically represented as an ever-youthful man, riding or near a peacock, dressed with weapons sometimes near a rooster. Most icons show him with one head, but some show him with six heads reflecting the legend surrounding his birth where six mothers symbolizing the six stars of Pleiades cluster <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> newly born baby Kartikeya. He grows up quickly into a philosopher-warrior, destroys {{evil in the}} form of demon Taraka, teaches the pursuit of ethical life and the theology of Shaiva Siddhanta. He has inspired many poet-sants, such as Arunagirinathar.|$|E
25|$|Portrait of Dr. Gachet {{is one of}} {{the most}} revered {{paintings}} by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. It depicts Dr. Paul Gachet <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> Van Gogh during the final months of his life. There are two authenticated versions of the portrait, both painted in June 1890 at Auvers-sur-Oise. Both show Gachet sitting at a table and leaning his head on his right arm but they are easily differentiated in color and style. In 1990, the first version fetched a record price of $82.5 million ($75 million, plus a 10 percent buyer's commission) when sold at auction in New York.|$|E

25|$|Still not {{satisfied}} with her revenge, Ní Mháille then sailed for Ballycroy and attacked the garrison at Doona Castle, overpowering the defenders and taking the castle for herself. Her attack against the MacMahons {{was not the first}} time she interrupted someone at their prayers. Legend tells of another lord who stole property from her and fled to a church for sanctuary. She was determined to wait out the thief, maintaining that he could starve or surrender. The thief dug a tunnel and escaped, however, and the hermit <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the church broke his vow of silence to scold her for attempting to harm someone who had sought sanctuary. Her reply is not recorded.|$|E
25|$|While a {{conductor}} at the Augsburg palace, Wendelin married Rosalie Scholle from Leipzig on 10 January 1865. They were married for 45 years but produced no children. Rosalie survived her husband, dying {{at the age}} of 79 on 25 September 1920 in Darmstadt. From Augsburg, Weißheimer went to the Kroll Opera in Berlin, then to the theater in Düsseldorf. From 1866 to 1868 he was in Würzburg. From here he tried once again a world premiere of his patriotic opera Theodor Körner. For this reason he looked up to Wagner in Munich. Wagner was living with Hans and Cosima von Bülow in a house on Arcisstraße, donated to him by the king and where Cosima was a housewife <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> Wagner's correspondence. Wagner soon became interested in Mrs. Bülow. His relationship with Weißheimer began to wane, and Weißheimer drew closer to Peter Cornelius at the premiere of the latter's 1865 opera Der Cid.|$|E
25|$|The second {{match was}} a six-man tag team match {{featuring}} Nation of Domination (Faarooq, Crush and Savio Vega) against Bart Gunn, Goldust and Flash Funk. All the six men began brawling with each other, until Nation {{were sent to}} the outside. As they regrouped, Funk dived from the top rope onto all the three members of Nation. Funk hit a hurricanrana on Vega from the top rope and tried to dive on the Nation again but they controlled his landing and dragged him into the ring. Faarooq, Crush and Vega took turns and attacked Funk. After a great damage, he was able to tag with Gunn <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> all three men. Gunn, Goldust and Funk sent Nation outside the ring and Gunn hit a diving bulldog on Faarooq and went for the cover but the referee was distracted in sending Goldust and Funk to the outside. Crush took advantage and hit a leg drop on Gunn while Faarooq pinned Gunn to get the win.|$|E

25|$|He {{lived with}} his mother in Mecca for three years until she took him to Yathrib to visit some {{relatives}} (uncles from the mother side), and she died on the way back. Now orphaned, Muhammad, aged 6, was passed into the custody of his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, who was eighty years old. According to traditional accounts, Muhammad was very close to his grandfather, as had been his father before him. However, two years later, his grandfather died. Muhammad then came under the care of his uncle Abu Talib, the new leader of the Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe. In 6th-century Arabia, there was general disdain for guardians <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the weaker members of the tribes in Mecca. Although Muhammad's guardians saw that he did not starve to death, it was hard for them to do more for him, especially as the fortunes of the clan of Hashim seem to have been declining at that time.|$|E
25|$|On 7 June 1941, {{the night}} before the {{invasion}} of the Syria–Lebanon Campaign, Dayan's unit crossed the border and secured two bridges over the Litani River. When they were not relieved as expected, at 04:00 on 8 June, the unit perceived that it was exposed to possible attack and—on its own initiative—assaulted a nearby Vichy police station, capturing it. A few hours later, as Dayan was {{on the roof of the}} building using binoculars to scan Vichy French positions on the other side of the river, the binoculars were struck by a French rifle bullet fired by a sniper from several hundred yards away, propelling metal and glass fragments into his left eye and causing severe damage. Six hours passed before he could be evacuated, and he would have died if not for Bernard Dov Protter, <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> him until they were evacuated. Dayan lost the eye. In addition, the damage to the extraocular muscles was such that Dayan could not be fitted with a glass eye, and he was compelled to adopt the black eye patch that became his trademark.|$|E
25|$|During the American Civil War, Winchester {{changed hands}} {{dozens of times}} and {{was the site of}} three major battles. Christ Church's new rector, Rev. William Meredith, quickly enlisted as a private in the 4th Virginia Cavalry, and after a year became the regimental chaplain. Rev. Meredith also officiated at the {{funerals}} of the first parishioners to die in the war: four soldiers, two of whom died at the First Battle of Manassas (long a major road and by then a railroad ran between the cities). Rev. Meredith oversaw the training of John Bell Tilden Reed, whom Bishop Meade ordained as a deacon on March 17, 1861 and <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the parish's spiritual needs in Meredith's absence, with the help of visiting clergy including Rev. Henderson Suter of Grace Church in Berryville, Rev. Thompson B. Maury and several other Confederate chaplains and others. Deacon J.B.T. Reed, already a mature man and active Mason as well as son of a Methodist minister, never was ordained a priest, but at the war's end initiated young Union Major William McKinley into Winchester's Hiram Lodge of Masons, as well as himself served as a missionary in various nearby churches before his death at age 89 in 1895. The parish's wardens were both Confederate sympathizers and law partners, Philip Williams and David Barton. The former was arrested by the Union army in 1864 and imprisoned in Wheeling, West Virginia. The latter lost three of his six sons who enlisted in the Confederate cause before dying himself in 1863. Rev. Joseph R. Jones of Cunningham Chapel was also arrested for reading a prayer for Jefferson Davis.|$|E
