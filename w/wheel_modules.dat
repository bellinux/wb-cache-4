40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new design of corner <b>wheel</b> <b>modules</b> for narrow vehicles. Independent corner <b>wheel</b> <b>modules</b> with {{integrated}} powertrain, suspension, steering, and camber mechanisms combined with x-by-wire technology can replace engines, mechanical linkages, and drive shafts in vehicles. The integration of such {{components in the}} corner module creates extra room {{that can be used}} for passenger comfort. The proposed module is especially appropriate for small and narrow vehicles where packaging of all vehicle subsystems is a demanding task. It also significantly simplifies the complex chassis design and assembly process of vehicles. The new concept introduced in this thesis utilizes a four-bar linkage as the steering mechanism for the first time. This corner module also incorporates another four-bar mechanism to provide active camber control for the wheel. It is shown how an active camber control considerably improves the rollover threshold of narrow vehicles. The combination of these two four-bar mechanisms results in a virtual kingpin axis that provides stability for the chassis system. This approach results in a highly compact design for the corner module that can be integrated into narrow vehicles. The feasibility of the kinematic design, mechanical design, and stress analysis is confirmed by fabricating a full sized prototype. This prototype was tested in the laboratory environment and verified the simulation results presented in this thesis. The prototype also showed that the new design is easy to assemble for manufacturing purposes and more importantly this module can easily be maintained during its life time...|$|E
40|$|The {{conditions}} of a secure loss of stability of a two-axle wheel vehicle with absolutely hard steering {{have been found}} before. The analytically derived {{conditions of}} a secure stability loss in case of torsional stiffness are dependent {{on the relationship between}} the slipping resistance coefficients, the transverse clutch coefficients on the axes, and the torsional stiffness of the controlled <b>wheel</b> <b>module.</b> In this case, the trail distance is taken into account in the <b>wheel</b> <b>module</b> control system, the mass of the module being neglected. The approach suggested in the paper does take into account the mass of the controlled <b>wheel</b> <b>module.</b> The slipping forces are presented accurate to a cubic term of expansion in slipping angles. The torsional stiffness intervals have been found that provide a secure loss of stability of a two-axle wheel vehicle model. The intervals have been obtained {{on the basis of a}} bifurcation analysis of actual bifurcations of the stationary states in the vicinity of the rectilinear motion of the model. Diagrams that illustrate the fulfillment of secure stability loss conditions and allow using the results obtained in designing a <b>wheel</b> <b>module</b> are presented in the paper. The technique used is alternative to the well-known M. Bautin’s approach to determination of secure-insecure conditions in case of a divergent loss of stability. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} support {{operations}} conducted in office or home, robots system is required to change its construction method and components. According to this, we propose a modules system for flexible and effective operation. Concretely, robots with mono-function (such as sensing or moving function) {{and the ability of}} wire-less communication are defined as mono-functional modules (Fig. 1). They are set up distributively on the objects of operation (e. g. table as an object of transporting) or in the working environment (such as wall, ceiling, etc.) and cooperate with each other (Fig. 2). It is necessary for the cooperation of distributed modules to set up the relationship between each other by acquiring their parameters. For instance, in the case that an object, which is equipped with <b>wheel</b> <b>modules,</b> is to transport by gaining the information from the ceiling camera module, the calibration of each module and their positions ’ and orientations ’ parameters under an unify coordinate system are indispensable. Traditionally, this kind of decentralized robots system’s calibration was carried out manually, and it is also troublesome and time-consuming in general. Based on this point of view, our research is aimed at the automatization for parameter identification in decentralized robots system. We propose an algorithm of rapid and accurate calibration among modules, especially for the transporting case we assumed. In that case, a transporting object, which was installed with <b>wheel</b> <b>modules</b> and a marker, was transported under the guide by catching information from the camera module in the changing environment. Considering the system of only one camera module and one wheel module, to minimize the affect of sensing and locating errors to parameters identification, the simulation for wheel module’s movement is illustrated as Fig. 3...|$|E

40|$|The <b>wheel</b> corner <b>module</b> {{represents}} {{a new technology}} for controlling the motion of avehicle. It {{is based on a}} modular design around the geometric boundaries of a conventionalwheel. The typical WCM consists of a wheel containing an electrical in-wheel propulsion motor, a friction brake, a steering system and a suspension system. Generally, the braking,steering and suspension systems are controlled by means of electrical actuators. The WCMis designed to easily, by means of bolted connections and a power connector, attach toa vehicle platform constructed for the specic purpose. All functions are controlled viaan electrical system, connecting the steering column to the module. A WCM vehicle cancontain two or four <b>wheel</b> corner <b>modules.</b> The purpose of this thesis is to serve as an introduction to <b>wheel</b> corner <b>module</b> technology. The technology itself, as well as advantages and disadvantages related to wheelcorner modules are discussed. An analysis of a variety of <b>wheel</b> corner <b>module</b> concepts iscarried out. In addition, simulations are conducted in order to estimate how an increasedunsprung mass aects the ride comfort and handling performance of a vehicle. Longitudinal translation over two types of road disturbance proles, a curb and a bump,is simulated. A quarter car model as well as a full car model is utilized. The obtainedresults indicate that handling performance is deteriorated in connection to an increase dunsprung mass. The RMS value of the tire force uctuation increases with up to 18 %,when 20 kg is added to each of the rear wheels of the full car model. Ride comfort is deteriorated or enhanced in connection to an increased unsprung mass, depending on the disturbance frequency of the road. When subjected to a road disturbance frequency below the eigenfrequency of the unsprung mass, ride comfort deterioration is indicated. The RMS vertical acceleration of the sprung mass increases with up to 6 %, in terms of the full car model. When subjected to a road disturbance frequency above the eigenfrequency ofthe unsprung mass, decreased RMS vertical acceleration of up to 25 % is noted, indicatinga signicantly enhanced ride comfort.

40|$|Purpose – In this paper, two {{omni-directional}} mobile {{vehicles are}} designed and controlled implementing distributed mechatronics controllers. Omni-directionality {{is the ability}} of mobile vehicle to move instantaneously in any direction. It is achieved by implementing Mecanum wheels in one vehicle and conventional wheels in another vehicle. The control requirements for omni-directionality using the two above-mentioned methods are that each wheel must be independently driven, and that all the four wheels must be synchronized in order to achieve the desired motion of each vehicle. Design/methodology/approach – Distributed mechatronics controllers implementing Controller Area Network (CAN) modules are used to satisfy the control requirements of the vehicles. In distributed control architectures, failures {{in other parts of the}} control system can be compensated by other parts of the system. Three-layered control architecture is implemented for; time-critical tasks, event-based tasks, and task planning. Global variables and broadcast communication is used on CAN bus. Messages are accepted in individual distributed controller modules by subscription. Findings – Increase in the number of distributed modules increases the number of CAN bus messages required to achieve smooth working of the vehicles. This requires development of higher layer to manage the messages on the CAN bus. Research limitations/implications – The limitation of the research is that analysis of the distributed controllers that were developed is complex, and that there are no universally accepted tool for conducting the analysis. The other limitation is that the mathematical models of the mobile robot that have been developed need to be verified. Practical implications – In the design of omni-directional vehicles, reliability of the vehicle can be improved by modular design of mechanical system and electronic system of the <b>wheel</b> <b>modules</b> and the sensor modules.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis {{addresses}} the design of the NMBU Mobile Agricultural Robot's drivetrain and steering assembly, while the second part discusses aspects related to controlling these systems. Part I: First, power requirements are calculated based on the expected worst case scenario. Second, the principle design of the systems is determined and parts are selected. For the drivetrain, a hub reduction system is used. The system comprises of four separate <b>wheel</b> <b>modules,</b> each with one brushless DC motor installed over the module's wheel. Power is transferred to an in-wheel planetary gearbox via a timing belt. For the steering assembly, brushless integrated servomotors with planetary gearboxes are used. The power distribution system is also discussed, and two designs are proposed, one for future and one for immediate implementation. All parts are selected based on availability, quality and cost. As a result, the components for the drivetrain are not perfectly matched. However, they allow for testing of the basic principle. Preliminary tests of the powertrain and steering assembly show promising results. Part II: Different components related to communication and control of the robot are presented, and the principle design of the motor control system is determined with interoperability between current and future systems in mind. ROS (Robotic Operating System) is selected to be used as the robotic framework, and the main computer and the various motor controllers are to communicate using the CANopen protocol. The process of configuring the propulsion motor controllers to match the propulsion motors is described, as is the process of setting up the servomotors. Problems were faced using the propulsion motors built in Hall sensors for feedback in closed loop speed mode, as the sensor assembly’s resolution proved to be too coarse.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the dynamics, gait generation and motion planning {{of a class}} of locomotion systems called modular locomotion systems that consist of a central base module with locomotion modules like legs, powered wheels or passive wheeled skate modules attached to ports on the base. These systems, {{by virtue of their}} often unconventional modes of locomotion, offer advantages in performing tasks where traditional wheeled and legged systems often fail, for example crawling through pipes, skating on ice, or climbing fences. ^ This thesis makes multiple contributions to the study of modular locomotion systems in enumeration, kinematic and dynamic analysis and motion planning. We present a scheme to enumerate the different robot configurations possible given a set of locomotive modules. For kinematic systems, we present a motion planning algorithm that incorporates the effect of intermittent contact of leg modules. A dynamic analysis is carried out for systems with multiple nonholonomic constraints using both the Lagrange D 2 ̆ 7 Alembert equations of motion and a process of Lagrangian reduction to define the connection that relates the group motion of the robot to the individual motion of the modules (shape inputs). We show how nonholonomic impacts, which occur when passive <b>wheel</b> <b>modules</b> make or break contact with the ground, can be incorporated into this analysis. ^ We study the dynamics, gait generation and motion planning for three dynamic systems with an unconventional actuation scheme and multiple nonholonomic constraints. We present simulation and experimental results to show how simple for ward and rotary gaits for the ROLLERBLADER, a robot with two degree of freedom legs with passive wheels mounted on the ends, can be composed to achieve motion planning. We also present a rollerblading gait that attempts to mimic human rollerblading motion. We show how the R OBOTRIKKE, a novel single input experimental system, can be controlled using a periodic input and visual feedback from an overhead camera to track a straight line trajectory. We present simulation results for controllers that balance a bicycle without pedals, propel it forwards and allow simple trajectory tracking once the bicycle reaches higher speeds. ...|$|E

A light weighted robot that avoids soil compaction. Two years later, a new team of master students designed and built Thorvald II, where the goal was to make the robot module based. The modularity formed the basis of this thesis, where the goal was to design a modified version of Thorvald. The modified robot is ordered by Vollebekk research farm, and its task is phenotyping, which is the observation of grain health. The goal was to make the robot capable of driving in the research field without causing any damage on grains. The selections of designs and components are based on Pugh’s method. Where different designs and components are compared based on advantages and drawbacks, and the one with the highest score is selected. In addition to designs and components, different materials and assembly techniques have been discussed. A Tora module was built before this thesis started, and tested in March this year. The test showed promising results, and an analysis was therefore made to find out if a lighter module could be used. Some modifications had to be made to the Thorvald <b>wheel</b> <b>module</b> to satisfy the requirements set by Vollebekk research farm, but as the changes were small, the modularity requirement was still fulfilled. Covers were designed with Vollebekk research farm’s requirements in mind. The goals were {{to make sure that the}} cover could separate the grains without damaging them, and still retain Thorvald’s modularity. With these requirements in mind, the covers were designed for use on four-wheel drive, four-wheel steering as well as this robot with two- wheel drive and caster wheels with differential steering. Time was the biggest obstacle in this thesis, and a functioning robot is therefore not tested yet. With the modifications made in mind, the robot will work better than Thorvald did last year. If results from testing look promising, the robot is ready for the phenotyping field. If not, new modifications should be made with following tests. To obtain optimal functionality, the next version of the robot should implement the following changes; - Skid steering instead of differential steering - Use of smaller dimensions on the Tora module, 40 mm pipe...|$|R

40|$|Gears {{are used}} to {{transmit}} mechanical workfrom one point to another. They are widely used in different mechanisms {{and they are the}} most important components of a transmission system. Thus, it is important that they are manufactured with high precision to deliver the work with highest possible efficiency. The dominant gear production method is metal cutting, like hobbing. The gear manufacturing industry aims to replace their traditional production lines with greener processes and thereby urge engineers to think about using metal forming methods instead of the traditional metal cutting solutions when possible. Gear rolling is an interesting metal forming method that can be an alternative method to fabricate gear wheels. Research on gear rolling firstly came into interest around 2000. Very few papers are published that covers the development of the method and its limitations and advantages. Almost all of these publications considered rolling of gear <b>wheels</b> with small <b>modules.</b> The focus of this study will be on application of gear rolling for gear <b>wheels</b> with large <b>module</b> (over 3 mm) where the amount of deformation is much larger than found in previous studies. In this thesis the Finite Element Method has been used to simulate and predict the results of rolling of high gears. In addition to that experiments were performed to validate the numerical results and develop the modelling technique for further investigations. The main topic of discussion is about the gear quality as a measure of the success for the process. Extra {{attention has been paid to}} the effects of friction and process planning in the result of process loads and also on the gear quality. The thesis structure is based on four published papers, and some additional results from the experiments which have not yet been published. According to the results of these papers, the effect of friction and process parameters are recognized in the final product quality. It is shown that FEM has a great potential in order to model and analyze the gear rolling process. A new approach to combine numerical methods with quality measurement to predict the process outcomes is also presented. The results show that gear <b>wheels</b> with a <b>module</b> of 4 mm reach an ISO quality level between 11 and 12. This is substantially lower quality than can be obtained with metal cutting operations. The results of this thesis can be used as the starting point for future research to optimize the quality of gear rolling for high gears. QC 20150914 </p...|$|R
