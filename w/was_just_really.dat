25|$|We {{really hit}} it off and we would go fishing every day. I was in awe of all these great songs he’d written, and he would play them on the {{acoustic}} guitar really hard, Johnny Ramone style, all six strings. He had this bitter resentment that drenched every step he took and every word that he spoke. His songs were just filled with that envy {{of people that are}} better looking, that are more successful. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> inspiring to be around someone that just hated everything that much. It was just great.|$|E
500|$|... "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> {{happy to}} make that shot", Yao said after the Americans’ 101–70 victory. [...] "It was the first score in our Olympic {{campaign}} here at home and I’ll always remember it. It represents that we can keep our heads up {{in the face of}} really tough odds." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It's sort of {{a message}} song. It's what 'Prince of Egypt' is about, Moses. If we were ever going to come {{together}} on any kind of record, this is definitely the right one, and really the coolest thing {{to me is that}} after all of the drama and everybody making it like we had a rivalry, she <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> cool and we had a really good time in the studio. We had fun. And so, if nothing else, it was a good experience... and diva-ism, whatever." ...|$|E
5000|$|.....We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> sensitive, {{creative}} people {{that wanted to}} make music and we were devoured by the industry and we didn’t {{get a lot of}} support and people didn’t understand Focus at the time." ...|$|R
5000|$|Live {{signed with}} Epic Records in 2005, having left Radioactive {{after the release}} of their 2003 album, Birds of Pray. Singer Ed Kowalczyk {{explained}} that Songs from Black Mountain is in the same vein as Birds of Pray: [...] "The album itself kind of took its lead from where we were with Birds of Pray, which <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a <b>really</b> basic, stripped approach...It's just amazing. It's just a great album and the excitement level of Epic and the band, everybody <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> pretty blown away by it." ...|$|R
25|$|And {{they were}} some of the most unassuming, laid-back people to ever work with. I mean, they had no {{attitude}} at all. They just came in and they <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> polite and very thankful, and then when they turned on the amps and made that noise, it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> unbelievable that it was coming from them.|$|R
500|$|Hendrickson told TVSource {{magazine}} {{that she was}} [...] "petrified" [...] of filming the heavily emotional storyline. She stated, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> intimidated because I don’t have a child. I’ve never experienced that unconditional love with someone – for someone [...] I really didn’t have that much to connect to in my own personal life. I think that’s what scared me the most – how I {{was going to find}} it within myself to tell a truthful story." [...] Having previously noted that becoming a mother [...] "matured" [...] Chloe, Hendrickson said, [...] "I would love to see {{a little bit of the}} old Chloe come out of this extreme loss that she’s just experienced. I think it would make a lot of sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Lo {{found the}} {{shooting}} difficult and exhausting {{because she had}} to walk around with a 22-pound camera strapped around her waist for the three days of the filming. She also stated that it was [...] "draining" [...] to represent the pain she felt when she wrote the track. At one point during the filming, Lo was drunk and tired, so {{she decided to go}} into the bathroom stall; concerning this, the singer confessed that: [...] "I was wasted and tired and it was a tough recording and I really just went into the bathroom and sat there by myself. There weren't any people around then and I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> alone in that stall. I just sat there and thought of anything that was happening during that time. The tears just came." [...] She also confessed that she barely remembered half of the recording. On 19 February 2014, she posted a teaser of the video on her Facebook account. On 17 March 2014, the music video was released via Lo's VEVO channel on YouTube, and was made available for consumption on the iTunes Store the next day.|$|E
500|$|Milian wrote So Amazin {{based on}} her own life, and each record pertained to a {{different}} aspect, especially focused on relationships. During early production of the album, Milian was dealing with her break-up with actor Nick Cannon and wrote several records based on that. While writing the mid-tempo track [...] "My Lovin' Goes", Milian felt she turned a new leaf. She said, [...] "you see the change in So Amazin where life <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> coming into place. I was finally becoming the woman that I feel that I am right now. Also, I was leaving old love behind and learning about new types of love. Which is great, whether it be life, and also the dating scene is really nice." [...] Two tracks which Milian wrote about Cannon were [...] "Gonna Tell Everybody" [...] and [...] "Who's Gonna Ride". When Milian and Cool & Dre had discussions, her break-up with Cannon was regularly mentioned. Milian felt a need to express herself, and writing became therapeutic for Milian; {{she was able to}} get through the break-up by writing songs. The production by Cool & Dre also inspired Milian to write the tracks, as she felt comfortable with them and was able to be open.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, Hansard {{indicated}} that they were no longer a romantic couple. He said, [...] "Of course, we fell into each other's arms. It was a very necessary part of our friendship but I think we both concluded that that wasn't what we really wanted to do. So we're not together now. We <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> good friends." ...|$|R
5000|$|Andrew Santos of With an Accent gave a good {{review to}} the episode {{saying that it}} was highly enjoyable. [...] "The main story arc was weird and helped develop a few of the characters. ... I liked the episode’s twist {{involving}} the ego. It would have been too cliché if we found out Amanda and Pottinger <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> high." ...|$|R

500|$|When Robbie {{first began}} filming, {{she was told}} that Donna was bisexual. Of this Robbie said, [...] "In one of the blocks she is talking to Bridget about their 'first time' and Donna asks Bridget if {{it was with a}} guy or girl? I liked the way the writers {{conveyed}} that, it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> subtle and they didn't make a big coming out scene of it. I think it's a good message to send out because it's not such a big deal to lots of people. Not all of them have such drama surrounding it". Donna's first storyline that included this aspect of her character was a kiss between herself and fellow female character, Sunny Lee (Hany Lee). The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is shocked when Donna leans over and kisses her on the lips, as it is her first kiss. The show's producers called the kiss between Sunny and Donna as [...] "impulsive" [...] and Robbie agreed saying [...] "It's really not a big deal at all. It's not an actual gay storyline, it's just kind of an impulsive peck". The storyline came weeks after rival soap Home and Away endured a backlash to its own same-sex romance.|$|E
2500|$|During October and November 2009, they {{recorded}} the album Absolute Dissent (2010), marking the band's 30th anniversary. It {{was preceded by}} the In Excelsis EP in June 2010. In November, the band received the [...] "Innovator Award" [...] at the 2010 Classic Rock Roll of Honour; the award was presented to Killing Joke by Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, who stated, [...] "I go back a long way with Jaz Coleman and the band. I used {{to go and see}} the band, and it was a band that really impressed me because Geordie's guitar sound <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>really,</b> really strong. And they were really tribal, the band, and it was really intense. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> good to hear something like that during the 80s, which sort of caved in a bit with haircuts and synthesizers". The band were also honoured by [...] Metal Hammer at their annual awards, receiving the Album of the Year award for Absolute Dissent.|$|E
2500|$|In August, Maroney competed at the Visa Championships in Dallas, Texas. [...] She placed twenty-seventh in the {{all-around}} with {{a two-day}} combined score of 104.800 {{and third in}} the vault final with a score of 29.900. When asked about {{the first time she}} performed an Amanar in competition, Maroney said, [...] "The first time I did it was at Visa Championships and I was just thirteen years old. I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> little and I didn't really know what was going on. [...] But I just did it, and I was just very happy that I landed on my feet." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kingsmill {{was married}} to Catherine, a fabric artist based in Maitland, New South Wales. The pair had met in 1978 and have three {{children}} together. They subsequently divorced, Catherine declared [...] "we are still friends. A marriage <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> hard to keep together when you're not together, but we never had a falling out or anything like that.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Since {{its release}} Sune Rose Wagner has stated {{the album is}} his {{favorite}} Raveonettes' album, stating [...] "I <b>just</b> think <b>is</b> our strongest body of work to date. All of the songs <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> good and the sound just sort of melts into each other. It's also super minimal how we recorded it yet so full on at the same time." ...|$|R

2500|$|Alfredsson {{began the}} 2011–12 season healthy, but was {{diagnosed}} with a concussion {{for the first time in}} his career after receiving a blow to the head from New York Rangers forward Wojtek Wolski on 29 October 2011. He returned on 11 November after missing five games, in a game against the Buffalo Sabres. On 30 December 2011, Alfredsson scored his 400th career goal, the game winner in overtime, versus the Calgary Flames. Widely assumed to be a candidate to be moved to a Stanley Cup contender at the 2012 trade deadline, Ottawa's strong play resulted in Alfredsson not being placed on the trade market. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> happy we didn’t have to make that decision", said Alfredsson of the possibility of leaving Ottawa.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{two members}} of the Harriton High School student council twice privately confronted their Principal, Steven Kline, more than a year prior to the suit. [...] They were {{concerned}} [...] "that the school could covertly photograph students using the laptops' cameras." [...] Students were particularly troubled by the momentary flickering of their webcams' green activation lights, which several students reported would periodically turn on when the camera wasn't in use, signaling that the webcam had been turned on. Student Katerina Perech recalled: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> creepy." [...] Some school officials reportedly denied that it was anything other than a technical glitch, and offered to have the laptops examined if students were concerned. [...] Kline admitted the school could covertly photograph students using the laptops' cameras. [...] The students told him they were worried about privacy rights, asked whether the school system read the saved files on their computers, and suggested that at minimum the student body should be warned formally of possible surveillance. [...] No such action was taken.|$|E

5000|$|In May 2015, Bush stated: [...] "The {{climate is}} changing" [...] but that [...] "I don't think {{the science is}} clear what {{percentage}} is man-made and what percentage is natural. It's convoluted. And for the people to say the science is decided on, this <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> arrogant, to <b>be</b> honest with you." [...] At the same event, Bush said that climate change should not be [...] "the highest priority" [...] issue, but should not be ignored either.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1987 Carne told Karen Middleton of The Canberra Times of his {{disappointment}} in their record company's choice of producers for Terrain and their previous management, [...] "we could've basically produced the album ourselves and probably done an equally good or better job, but unfortunately record companies want names of producers {{on the album}} ... and the guys we're dealing with on our level ... <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> average {{and you end up}} doing the job anyway".|$|R
50|$|There is some dispute as {{to whether}} Hirudinea should be a class itself, or a {{subclass}} of the Clitellata. The resolution mainly depends on the eventual fate of the oligochaetes, which as noted above, do not form a natural group as traditionally circumscribed. Another possibility would be to include the leeches in the taxon Oligochaeta, which would then be ranked as a class and contain most of the clitellates. The Branchiobdellida are leechlike clitellates that were formerly included in the Hirudinea, but <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> close relatives.|$|R

5000|$|Swardson defended Bucky Larson in an October 2011 interview, {{in which}} he blamed its poor {{financial}} showing on the difficulties of advertising the material: [...] "To promote an R-rated movie, with commercials, with this character, it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>really,</b> really hard. It {{was hard to get}} the movie across to people. The trailer in theaters was really tame because we couldn't show any of the insanity, and even if we did it, it wouldn't hit because it had no context. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> frustrating." [...] He predicted the film would find more appreciation on DVD.|$|E
5000|$|The {{title was}} {{inspired}} by Lord of the Flies with lead singer Chad stating, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> into {{the idea of a}} civilization restarting but with a new mentality of, like, kids starting it up. Like something brand new." ...|$|E
5000|$|After a runner-up finish, Harvick said he [...] "ran 10th all day. So I’m <b>just</b> <b>really,</b> really happy. When you’re {{able to take}} a 10th-place car - at best - {{and drive}} it 450 miles and then make huge gains (the rest of the way). At the end of the race we {{obviously}} didn’t have the best car. Those guys (Truex’s Furniture Row Racing team) have had some fast cars this year and tonight definitely had the dominant car. Early on we <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> bad. Tight coming into corners and loose coming out. Nothing seemed to be working and then <b>were</b> <b>just</b> stepped back and swung for the fences. We were able to pass with our car once we got our handling together. The cars were already sliding around a fair amount all day.” ...|$|R

"We are {{not afraid}} to explore the real side of the {{relationship}} and the challenges," [...] Dan Amboyer, who plays William, said while promoting the movie {{at a meeting of the}} Television Critics Association."Diana features in the film," [...] Alice St. Clair, who portrays Middleton, said. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> a great sense of relationships within the family. So there is William's relationship with his father and his brother, and you see him calling upon Diana's interview, and watching this interview that Diana did and using her words to kind of guide him through his troubled moments.".|$|R

50|$|SMT {{was founded}} in 1988 by Gerard J.

ClevverTV talked about the music video, stating that [...] "the vibe <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>really</b> upbeat".

5000|$|They {{had stopped}} making it {{three years before}} and we found some of it. All the new color film stocks have this T-Grain, like little Ts that are interlocking.

We didn't want that. Normally you don't want to use that kind of stock because the colors will be off. It does have a shelf life {{but in this case}} we didn't care, the more fucked up it was the happier we were.|$|R
