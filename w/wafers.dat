40|$|During acoustically stimulated LIGA development, a <b>wafer</b> {{receives}} {{sound waves}} {{from both sides}} at {{a wide variety of}} incidence angles that vary in time depending on the orientation of the <b>wafer</b> relative to the multiple transducers that are typically actuated in a periodic sequence. It is important to understand the influence of these variables on the transmission of energy through the <b>wafer</b> as well as the induced motion of the <b>wafer</b> itself because these processes impact the induced acoustic streaming of the fluid within features, the mechanism presently thought responsible for enhanced development of LIGA features. In the present work, the impact of <b>wafer</b> elasticity on LIGA development is investigated. Transmission waves, <b>wafer</b> bending waves, and the related concepts such as critical bending frequency, mechanical impedance, coincidence, and resonance, are discussed. Supercritical-frequency incident waves induce supersonic bending waves in the <b>wafer.</b> Incident wave energy is channeled into three components, transmitted, reflected and energy deposited to the <b>wafer,</b> depending on the <b>wafer</b> material, thickness and wave incidence angle. Results show at normal incidence for a 1 -mm PMMA <b>wafer,</b> about 47 % of the wave energy is deposited in the <b>wafer.</b> The <b>wafer</b> gains almost half of the incident energy, a result that agrees well with the Bankert et a 1 measurements. In LIGA development, transmitted waves may sometimes produce strong acoustic motion of the developer on the <b>wafer</b> backside, especially for the so-called coincidence case in which almost all incident wave energy transfers to the backside. <b>Wafer</b> bending waves cause <b>wafer</b> oscillation at high frequency, promoting the development process, but features shaking may weaken their attachments to the substrate. Resonance is not likely for the entire <b>wafer,</b> but may occur in short and wide <b>wafer</b> feature columns, which are least likely to break away from the substrate, perhaps resulting in good agitation of the fluid in adjacent feature cavities...|$|R
