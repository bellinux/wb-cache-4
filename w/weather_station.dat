50|$|In a 2003 study {{conducted}} on the Central Coast of California, the performance of atmometers was {{compared with that of}} the more expensive <b>weather</b> <b>stations.</b> Atmometers were placed adjacent to seven <b>weather</b> <b>stations</b> around the area and weekly values were recorded for each method. The results indicated that the atmometers and <b>weather</b> <b>stations</b> yielded very similar results, both producing comparable evapotranspiration (ET) readings. Under conditions of lower evapotranspiration, the atmometers produced slightly lower ET values than those of the <b>weather</b> <b>stations.</b> Studies conducted by Colorado State University and the United States Department of Agriculture in Fort Collins produced similar results. The atmometers produced evapotranspiration values that were very close to the data calculated from <b>weather</b> <b>stations.</b> These studies show that atmometers are especially useful for areas that {{do not have access to}} nearby <b>weather</b> <b>stations</b> and/or evapotranspiration data.|$|R

5|$|On November 29 a {{disturbance}} in the ITCZ began gaining organization near Palmyra Island, which the ITCZ had been near {{for a week}} prior. The <b>weather</b> <b>station</b> on the island reported southwestern surface winds of 50mph and a pressure of 1002.7mbar and that during the night, the wind velocity peaked at 70mph. Because of an irregular schedule for reporting, the last report received from the <b>weather</b> <b>station,</b> obtained eighteen hours earlier, had reported only small winds and 1004.7mb pressure. Most noteworthy about this report was the 3-hour pressure tendency, which reported -3.2mbar. Post-analysis revealed that this tendency was an indication of tropical cyclone development.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Helene recurving away from the United States East Coast, damage in the United States outside of the Carolinas was less severe. In Virginia, damage was {{relatively}} minor. A peak gust of 56mph (90km/h) was reported in Norfolk. In Hampton Roads, damage was minor, and was confined to downed utility wires and marginal infrastructural damage. Although rainfall was primarily concentrated in the Carolinas, 1,434official rain gauges measured precipitation in coastal areas from South Carolina to Maine. Precipitation was further increased by a frontal zone to the hurricane's north. In the Mid-Atlantic States, rainfall peaked at 5.29in (134.4mm) in Myerstown, Pennsylvania. Outside of Pennsylvania or the Carolinas, no <b>weather</b> <b>station</b> reported rainfall exceeding 5in (125mm). In the New England region, rainfall peaked at 4.11in (104.4mm) in Hyannis, Massachusetts. Elsewhere in Massachusetts, rainfall totals ranging from 1–4in (25–100mm) caused minor flooding and road washouts. The minor floods led to several automotive accidents. Other states in New England reported rainfall peaks of at least 1in (25mm), with the lowest peak occurring at a <b>weather</b> <b>station</b> in Machias, Maine, which reported 1.16in (29.5mm) of rainfall.|$|E
