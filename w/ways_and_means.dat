5|$|Tariffs {{had been}} raised to high levels during the Civil War. Afterwards, Garfield, who made a close study of {{financial}} affairs, advocated moving towards free trade, though the standard Republican position was a protective tariff that would allow American industries to grow. This break with his party likely cost him his place on the <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> Committee in 1867, and though Republicans held {{the majority in the}} House until 1875, Garfield remained off that committee during that time. Garfield came to chair the powerful House Appropriations Committee, but it was <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means,</b> with its influence over fiscal policy, that he really wanted to lead. Part of the reason Garfield was denied a place on <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> was the opposition of the influential Republican editor, Horace Greeley.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the House <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> Committee and former {{chairman}} of the Subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures, Neal is an influential figure in House economic policy. He has also dedicated much of his career to US–Ireland relations and maintaining American involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process, for which he has won several acclamations. He has a generally liberal voting record, but is considered a moderate on such issues as abortion and trade.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, Rangel {{advocated}} continued funding of anti-poverty efforts, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Child care and development block grant. Rangel {{also had an}} unproductive relationship with <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> chairman Bill Thomas, leading to an incident in which Thomas called the United States Capitol Police on Rangel for having his members read {{a bill in the}} library, an action Thomas apologized for.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, {{with the}} Republicans in the majority, McKinley sought {{election}} as Speaker of the House. He failed {{to gain the}} post, which went to Thomas B. Reed of Maine; however, Speaker Reed appointed McKinley chairman of the <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> Committee. The Ohioan guided the McKinley Tariff of 1890 through Congress; although McKinley's work was altered through the influence of special interests in the Senate, it imposed a number of protective tariffs on foreign goods.|$|E
5|$|On September 3, 2009, The Washington Post {{called on}} Rangel to resign his {{chairmanship}} of the House <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> Committee, given the ethical issues that had surfaced. Another Republican resolution was put forth to force {{him out of his}} chairmanship. However, Rangel stayed in place and mostly maintained his role in House leadership and policy discussions, including the Obama health care reform plan (opposition to which, he suggested, was partly due to racial prejudice against President Obama). Nevertheless, his influence was diminished by the questions surrounding him.|$|E

5|$|The {{political}} {{positions of}} Paul Ryan, the U.S. Representative from Wisconsin's 1st congressional district since 1999 and currently the 54th Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, are generally conservative, {{with a focus}} on fiscal policy. Ryan was Chairman of the House Budget Committee from 2011 to 2015 and of <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> in 2015. Ryan was the Republican nominee for Vice President as the running mate of Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Carlisle {{selected}} William Ralls Morrison, another tariff reformer, to {{lead the}} <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> committee, but allowed Randall {{to take charge of}} Appropriations. Morrison's committee produced a bill proposing tariff reductions of 20%; Randall opposed the idea from the start, as did the Republicans. Another bout of illness kept Randall away from Congress at a crucial time in April 1884, and the tariff bill passed a procedural hurdle by just two votes. Two days later, Randall's Appropriations committee reported several funding bills with his support. Many Democrats who had voted for Morrison's tariff were thereby reminded that Randall had the power to defeat spending that was important to them; when the final vote came, enough switched sides to join with Republicans in defeating the reform 156 to 151.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest VII is {{best known}} for its huge size. Without {{completing}} the game's side quests, a single game of Dragon Quest VII can take a hundred hours or more. In terms of gameplay, not much has changed from previous installments; battles are still fought in a turn-based mode from a first person perspective. Although non-battle sequences are rendered in 3D, battles themselves are still portrayed two dimensionally. The ability to talk with the party characters in and outside of battles was added to this game. They offer advice about battle strategies and plot points, or simply comment on how they feel at a given moment. There are four <b>ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>means</b> of locomotion: feet, boat, magic carpet, and skystone. Each of these can move across different terrain.|$|E

40|$|Grammaticalization {{is defined}} as “a process whereby a lexical item, with full {{referential}} meaning, develops grammatical meaning” (Fischer and Rosenbach 2000 : 2; see also Hopper 1991; Diewald and Wischer 2002). According to Rissanen, grammaticalization may occur both with native and borrowed items at any stage of the History of English, being developed from one single lexical item {{or a group of}} words (2000 : 152). This is the case of by <b>way</b> of <b>and</b> by <b>means</b> of that, according to the OED, were first attested in English {{at the beginning of the}} fifteenth century. Their prepositional function is the result of a process of grammaticalization undergone by <b>way</b> <b>and</b> <b>mean,</b> which evolved from noun to preposition in these contexts. Once established in the language, they coexisted until the end of the seventeenth century, the moment when by way of was progressively obliterated as a result of the on-going difffusion of by means of in these environments. Therefore, the present paper has been conceived with the following objectives: 1) to assess the grammaticalization process by which nouns such as <b>way</b> <b>and</b> <b>mean</b> developed prepositional functions for the expression of instrumentality; 2) to analyse the use and distribution of by <b>way</b> of <b>and</b> by <b>means</b> of in the History of English; 3) to investigate the distribution of these competing forms in terms of gender and social class.

5|$|From {{his first}} term in Congress, McKinley was a strong {{advocate}} of protective tariffs. The primary purposes of such imposts was not to raise revenue, but to allow American manufacturing to develop by giving it a price advantage in the domestic market over foreign competitors. McKinley biographer Margaret Leech noted that Canton had become prosperous as a center for the manufacture of farm equipment because of protection, and that this may have helped form his political views. McKinley introduced and supported bills that raised protective tariffs, and opposed those that lowered them or imposed tariffs simply to raise revenue. Garfield's election as president in 1880 created a vacancy on the House <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> Committee; McKinley was selected to fill it, placing him on the most powerful committee after only two terms.|$|E
5|$|In February 1971, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{health insurance}} reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, federalization of Medicaid for the poor with dependent minor children, and support for health maintenance organizations. Hearings on national health insurance were held in 1971, but no bill {{had the support of}} House <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> and Senate Finance Committee chairmen Representative Wilbur Mills and Senator Russell Long. Kennedy sponsored and helped pass the limited Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. He also played a leading role, with Senator Jacob Javits, in the creation and passage of the National Cancer Act of 1971.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} session of the 33rd Congress, Breckinridge acted as {{spokesman}} for <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> Committee bills, including a bill to assume and pay the debts Texas incurred prior to its annexation. Breckinridge's friends, W. W. Corcoran and Jesse D. Bright, were two of Texas's major creditors. The bill, which was approved, paid only those debts related to powers Texas surrendered to Congress upon annexation. Breckinridge was disappointed that the House defeated a measure to pay the Sioux $12,000 owed them for the 1839 purchase of {{an island in the}} Mississippi River; the debt was never paid. Another increase in the subsidy to the Collins Line passed over his opposition, but Pierce vetoed it.|$|E

5|$|Of 234 {{representatives in}} the House, Breckinridge was one of 80 re-elected to the Thirty-third Congress. His {{relative}} seniority, and Pierce's election, increased his influence. He was rumored to have Pierce's backing for Speaker of the House, but he again deferred to Boyd; Maryland's Augustus R. Sollers spoiled Boyd's unanimous election by voting for Breckinridge. Still not given a committee chairmanship, {{he was assigned to}} the <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> Committee, where he secured passage of a bill to cover overspending in fiscal year 1853–1854; {{it was the only time}} in his career that he solely managed a bill. His attempts to increase Kentucky's allocation in a rivers and harbors bill were unsuccessful but popular with his Whig constituents.|$|E
5|$|Of the 234 {{members of}} the House, Breckinridge was among the 80 that were {{returned}} to their seats for the Thirty-third Congress. Due to his increased seniority, {{he was assigned to}} the more prestigious <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> Committee, but he was not given a committee chairmanship as many had expected. Although he supported Pierce's pro-slavery agenda on the principle of states' rights and believed that secession was legal, he opposed secession as a remedy to the country's immediate problems. This, coupled with his earlier support of manumission and African colonization, balanced his support for slavery; most still considered him a moderate legislator.|$|E

5|$|Sereno E. Payne, {{chairman}} of the House <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> Committee, had held hearings in late 1908, and sponsored the resulting draft legislation. On balance, the bill reduced tariffs slightly, but when it passed the House in April 1909 and reached the Senate, the {{chairman of}} the Senate Finance Committee, Rhode Island Senator Nelson W. Aldrich, attached many amendments raising rates. This outraged progressives such as Wisconsin's Robert M. La Follette, who urged Taft to say that the bill was not in accord with the party platform. Taft refused, angering them. Taft insisted that most imports from the Philippines be free of duty, and according to Anderson, showed effective leadership on a subject he was knowledgeable on and cared about.|$|E
5|$|To fund this army, Hamilton wrote {{regularly}} to Oliver Wolcott Jr., his successor at the Treasury William Loughton Smith, of the House <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> Committee and Senator Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts. He directed them {{to pass a}} direct tax to fund the war. Smith resigned in July 1797, as Hamilton scolded him for slowness, and told Wolcott to tax houses instead of land. The eventual program included a Stamp Act {{like that of the}} British before the Revolution and other taxes on land, houses, and slaves, calculated at different rates in different states, and requiring difficult and intricate assessment of houses. This provoked resistance in southeastern Pennsylvania, led primarily by men such as John Fries who had marched with Washington against the Whiskey Rebellion.|$|E

Speaker Galusha Grow, whose views placed him with Stevens among the members becoming known as the Radical Republican (for their position on slavery, as opposed to the Conservative or Moderate Republicans), appointed him as chairman of the House <b>Ways</b> <b>and</b> <b>Means</b> Committee.
