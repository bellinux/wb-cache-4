They come clear and bell-like, and from a greater distance in the horizon, {{as if there were}} fewer impediments than in summer to make them faint and ragged. The ground is sonorous, like seasoned wood, and even the ordinary rural sounds are melodious, and the jingling of the ice on the trees is sweet and liquid. There is the least possible moisture in the atmosphere, all being dried up, or congealed, and it is of such extreme tenuity and elasticity, that it becomes a source of delight. The withdrawn and tense sky seems groined like the aisles of a cathedral, and the polished air sparkles as if there were crystals of ice floating in it. As they who have resided in Greenland tell us, that, when it freezes, [...] "the sea smokes like burning turf-land, and a fog or mist arises, called frost-smoke," [...] which [...] "cutting smoke frequently raises blisters on the face and hands, and is very pernicious to the health." [...] But this pure stinging cold is an elixir to the lungs, and not so much a frozen mist, as a crystallized midsummer haze, refined and purified by cold.|$|E

She has placed her hopes on winning the annual {{inspection}} of the blue ribbons, where the mysterious headmistress arrives from afar and after watching them dance, chooses one girl from the class to leave with her. Though Mademoiselle Edith cautions that she shouldn't get her hopes up, Alice has been anticipating this moment - and her own winning of the honor of leaving. Though the competition is close, another girl is chosen instead. Alice collapses at the headmistress's feet. She convalesces, but isn't the same as before: she doesn't speak, and aimlessly and perpetually stares into space. Finally, she runs away, and climbs the stone wall that surrounds the school.

40|$|Can <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> our brain? Is {{there any}} {{technique}} which can {{enable us to}} hear the neuro-electrical impulses originating from the different lobes of brain? The answer to all these questions is YES. In this paper we present a novel method {{with which we can}} sonify the Electroencephalogram (EEG) data recorded in rest state as well as under the influence of a simplest acoustical stimuli - a tanpura drone. The tanpura drone has a very simple yet very complex acoustic features, which is generally used for creation of an ambiance during a musical performance. Hence, for this pilot project we chose to study the correlation between a simple acoustic stimuli (tanpura drone) and sonified EEG data. Till date, there have been no study which deals with the direct correlation between a bio-signal and its acoustic counterpart and how that correlation varies under the influence of different types of stimuli. This is {{the first of its kind}} study which bridges this gap and looks for a direct correlation between music signal and EEG data using a robust mathematical microscope called Multifractal Detrended Cross Correlation Analysis (MFDXA). For this, we took EEG data of 10 participants in 2 min 'rest state' (i. e. with white noise) and in 2 min 'tanpura drone' (musical stimulus) listening condition. Next, the EEG signals from different electrodes were sonified and MFDXA technique was used to assess the degree of correlation (or the cross correlation coefficient) between tanpura signal and EEG signals. The variation of γx for different lobes during the course of the experiment also provides major interesting new information. Only music stimuli has the ability to engage several areas of the brain significantly unlike other stimuli (which engages specific domains only).

40|$|One of the {{interesting}} questions in vehicle acoustics {{is how do we}} evaluate <b>the</b> instationary <b>sounds.</b> What are <b>the</b> relative contributions of the different sequences to the overall quality judgment, if <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> have two characteristic time sequences? Normal operation of a vehicle covers stationary and instationary sounds depending on driving condition. “Engine start ” (instationary) and “Idle ” (quasi-stationary) are two examples of these driving conditions which are coupled with each other functionally. Therefore <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> of these conditions sequentially. Once such a hearing experience is over, we can form an overall evaluation of it. This study deals with the rules behind the evaluation process. We examine the hypothesis stating that the experience over time is not a simple combination of its discrete components. The influences of the extreme part (feature-based), beginning part and the final part of the experience to the overall evaluation are investigated. In order to approach this aim in a systematic way, psychoacoustical experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, the binaurally recorded engine start and <b>the</b> idle <b>sounds</b> of 12 cars from different brands were presented to the nonexpert subjects. They were asked to describe what they like and dislike about engine start and idle <b>sounds.</b> Some of <b>the</b> verbal descriptors which were used by the subjects were selected for the further experiments. In these experiments, the engine start and idle sounds were evaluated separately and variously combined by the subjects using a quasi continues scale. The results of the experiments give some important hints for the experience summation of multiple events...|$|R
40|$|Philosophers often {{claim that}} it is through speech that we make {{knowledge}} of our minds available to one another, {{and that it is}} through the medium of a shared language that we achieve a genuine meeting of minds. When combined with a conception of linguistic understanding as the direct perception of meaning in people’s words, the view suggests that there is no barrier to knowing the minds of others. Certainly, when listening to a language we understand, <b>we</b> do not <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> acoustic speech signal as just a sequence of sounds: <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> what is being said. As a phenomenological observation, the claim is impeccable, but it is mistaken epistemologically to assume that when <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> words as meaningful it is because <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> meanings in <b>the</b> <b>sounds,</b> perceived as immediately present on the surface of speech. As I shall argue, talk of the surface of speech and <b>the</b> location of <b>sounds</b> is misplaced. What we directly perceive are <b>the</b> sources of <b>sounds,</b> and <b>the</b> source of speech <b>sounds</b> is <b>the</b> human voice. The experience of listening to speech gives us non-linguistic information about a voice as source, while <b>the</b> meanings <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> voiced <b>sounds</b> to have are the meanings we as listeners have attached to those words: the meanings they have for us. Contrary to expectations, this inner model of linguistic understanding can still accommodate knowledge of what others are saying, and so presents no obstacle to our knowing what others have in mind...|$|R

60|$|Christendom {{would have}} been entirely {{justified}} in the abstract in being alarmed or suspicious at the mere rise of a great power that was not Christian. Nobody nowadays would think it odd to express regret at {{the rise of a}} power because it was Militarist or Socialist or even Protectionist. But it is far more natural to be conscious of a difference, not about the order of battle but the battle of life; not about our definable enjoyment of possessions, but about our much more doubtful possession of enjoyment; not about the fiscal divisions between us and foreigners but about the spiritual divisions even between us and friends. These are the things that differ profoundly with differing views of the ultimate nature of the universe. For the things of our country are often distant; but the things of our cosmos are always near; we can shut our doors upon the wheeled traffic of our native town; but in our own inmost chamber <b>we</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> that never ceases; that wheel which Dante and a popular proverb have dared to christen as the love that makes the world go round. For this is the great paradox of life; that there are not only wheels within wheels, but the larger wheels within the smaller. When a whole community rests on one conception of life and death and the origin of things, it is quite entitled to watch the rise of another community founded on another conception as the rise of something certain to be different and likely to be hostile. Indeed, as I have pointed out touching certain political theories, we already admit this truth in its small and questionable examples. We only deny the large and obvious examples.|$|R
