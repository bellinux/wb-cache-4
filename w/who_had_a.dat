40|$|Purpose: Fire setters <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{intellectual}} disability (ID) are often identified as posing a particular {{danger to the}} community although relatively {{little is known about}} their characteristics, treatment, and support needs. Methodology: This study describes the characteristics of 134 residents of low, medium, and high security ID facilities in the United Kingdom <b>who</b> <b>have</b> either <b>an</b> index offence of arson, comparing them with those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> violentn index offence, involving either violent or a sexual indexal offenceding. Findings: Index arson offenders <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> ID <b>had</b> multiple prior convictions, a history of violent offending, and a high likelihood of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> comorbid mental disorder. There were many shared characteristics across the three groups. Practical implications: The current study suggests that offenders <b>who</b> <b>have</b> ID <b>who</b> set fires <b>have</b> treatment needs that {{are similar to those of}} violent and sex offenders. It follows that fire setters <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> ID may also benefit from participating in more established offending behaviour treatment programs, such as cognitive behaviour therapy programs, developed for other types of offender. Originality: This study is one of the few which has investigated the characteristics and treatment needs of persons <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> ID <b>who</b> set fires. In particular, it is one of the first to compare the characteristics and treatment needs for persons with ID who set fires, to those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> committed violent and sexual offences...|$|R
