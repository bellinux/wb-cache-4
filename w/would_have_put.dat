5|$|Shin Megami Tensei, as {{with many}} other early Megami Tensei titles, was {{initially}} not localized for the West due to its controversial content such as the portrayal of religious elements. This content clashed with Nintendo's strict content policy guidelines. The PlayStation port was also prevented from being localized by Sony's then-current approval policy. The possibility of later localization after the series became established in the West were stalled due {{to the age of}} the game, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> it at a disadvantage in the modern gaming market.|$|E
5|$|After socialist {{gains in}} the legislature, the Argentine {{government}} introduced several bills in May 1914 which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> the battleships up for sale, {{but they were all}} defeated by late June. Following the commencement of the First World War, the German and British ambassadors to the United States both complained to the US State Department; the former believed that the British were going to be given the ships as soon as the ships reached Argentina, and the latter considered it the responsibility of the United States to ensure that the ships never left Argentina's possession. International armament companies attempted to get Argentina to sell to one of the smaller Balkan countries and expected that the ships would then find their way into the war.|$|E
5|$|Baroš {{broke his}} ankle in a September 2003 match against Blackburn Rovers, a match which also saw {{teammate}} Jamie Carragher sustain a broken leg. Baroš subsequently missed {{five months of}} football and scored just two goals in the 2003–04 season. His first goal came in a league match against Leeds United in February 2004, while his other goal was in March in a 1–1 Champions League draw against Marseille. Baroš would later claim that had manager Gérard Houllier stayed at the club after the summer of 2004, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> in a transfer request. As it was, Houllier left the club {{and was replaced by}} Rafael Benítez.|$|E

5|$|Dorothy died in 1586 and Robert married Dorothy Dymock, {{with whom}} he had seven {{children}} at Plas Mawr. When Robert died in 1598 he left a complex will that led to legal disputes between the family and the executor, Sir Roger Mostyn. The legal case effectively halted any further development of the house, by now the most prominent in Conwy, until its resolution in 1630. The property passed to Robert's grandson, another Robert Wynn, in 1637, and onto his daughter, Elin in 1683. By 1665, the house was equipped to a quality and style that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> it only just behind the houses of the major gentry families in Caernarfonshire. Elin then married into the Wynne family, and made little use of the house, and it ultimately passed by marriage into the Mostyn family.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} round, Bolton {{had their first}} trip, and their first game against top-flight opposition, facing Liverpool at Anfield on 3 December. Jardel scored the first goal within five minutes, with Danny Murphy {{equalising}} with 20 minutes remaining. Youri Djorkaeff <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> Bolton back into the lead, but referee Mike Riley disallowed it for an earlier handball; they scored minutes later from Jay-Jay Okocha's free kick. Liverpool got a second equaliser from a 25-yard Vladimír Šmicer strike, but with a minute remaining Salif Diao fouled Kevin Davies in the penalty area and Djorkaeff sent the resulting spot-kick past Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek to win the game. Thirteen days later, in extra time at home to the Premier League's Southampton, Pedersen volleyed the only goal with five minutes remaining.|$|E
5|$|Intense Confederate and {{especially}} Union artillery fire continued {{for at least}} an hour, slackening at about 2:30pm. At about 3:30pm, Lewis Armistead noticed Union skirmishers creeping towards his men where the grand battery on the Confederate right flank was, nearly within rifle range of them. Armistead sent three regiments (about half of his brigade) from his command to push back the skirmishers, thus beginning the infantry part of the battle. The skirmishers were repelled quickly, but Armistead's men found themselves {{in the midst of an}} intense Union barrage. The Confederates decided to nestle themselves in a ravine along the hill's slant. This position protected them from the fire, but pinned them down on the slopes of Malvern Hill, unsupported by either infantry or artillery. They did not have enough men to advance any further and retreating <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> them back into the crossfire.|$|E

5|$|The Argentine government, {{bolstered by}} socialist {{additions}} in the legislature, introduced several bills in May 1914 which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> the battleships up for sale, but the bills were all defeated by late June. Following {{the commencement of}} the First World War, the German and British ambassadors to the United States both complained to the US State Department; the former believed that the British {{were going to be}} given the ships as soon as they reached Argentina, and the latter charged the United States with ensuring that the ships fell into Argentina's possession only. International armament companies attempted to influence Argentina into selling them to one of the smaller Balkan countries, from which they would find their way into the war.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Brown was {{successful}} in the tour matches when he played as an opener. He ended the tour with eight centuries {{and a total of}} 1,448 first-class runs at an average of 57.92, behind only Bradman, Hassett and Morris in the runs and averages, with a highest score of 200 against Cambridge University. Brown's tally of eight centuries was second only to Bradman, and took his tally on English soil to 18 first-class tons. Excluding the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and the first two Tests, in which Brown had scored 25, 26, 17, 24 and 32 batting in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened, Brown scored 1,324 runs at 66.20 while opening in the other matches, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> him in a clear fourth place on the batting averages. Following his omission from the Test team midway through the tour, Brown batted in a slow and conservative manner in order to score more runs and regain his position, much to the chagrin of the crowds.|$|E
5|$|The {{options for}} the new stadium {{included}} adding a third tier to the existing National Stadium, or moving to a new site. This last option was discounted {{because it would have}} required a vast car parking facility, and that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> severe short-term pressures on the local transport infrastructure, creating traffic jams and pollution. The committee eventually chose a new stadium on the same site but with considerable increase in its capacity. It would also involve moving the alignment of the stadium from west-east to north-south. This was the option supported by the Millennium Commission. It would become the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site. It was also decided that the new stadium should have a sliding roof to accommodate a multi-use venue, with a grass pitch for rugby and football. The only other sliding roofs in Europe at the time were at two Dutch stadia – the Amsterdam Arena, completed in 1996 with a capacity of 50,000; and Gelredome in Arnhem, a 30,000-capacity ground built from 1996 to 1998.|$|E

5|$|For a long time, the Megami Tensei {{franchise}} was not {{exported to}} western territories despite {{there being a}} recognized market. The original reasons were the heavy religious themes and symbols used, which were considered taboo in western game markets, and Nintendo's strict content guidelines for overseas releases. Later, many of these early works were prevented from coming overseas due to their age, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> them at a disadvantage in the modern gaming market. Early entries on the PlayStation were also blocked by Sony of America's then-current approval policies. The first title in the franchise to be localized was Jack Bros.; the first role-playing game in the franchise to receive an overseas release was the first Persona game. This was done to give Atlus' North American branch a flagship RPG franchise that could compete {{with the likes of}} Final Fantasy, Suikoden and Breath of Fire. According to Okada, the naming of creatures and enemies was adjusted from the main series and original Japanese release of Persona to make it more acceptable for an overseas audience. Though it managed to establish the franchise overseas, the localization was a taxing task due to a small staff and the need to change multiple aspects to suit a North American audience, including removing references to Japanese culture and changing one character from Japanese to African-American. The first Persona 2 title, Innocent Sin, needed to be passed over due to shortage of manpower and the fact that development was focused on the second title, Eternal Punishment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 18 August, the Austro-Hungarians {{launched}} another attack, {{with the intention of}} pushing the 1st Šumadija Division off the Šabac bridgehead to allow the 5th Army to advance. However, the attack failed as the Serbs defeated the Austro-Hungarians at the Dobrava River, forcing their surviving soldiers to withdraw. Elsewhere, the Serbian 2nd Army's counter-offensive continued along the Cer and Iverak, with the 1st Combined Division attacking the village of Rašulijača and coming under severe pressure at Kosanin Grad. The first Serbian assault was fought off, but a wave of further attacks followed throughout the night. In {{the early morning}} of 19 August, the Serbs finally defeated the Austro-Hungarians and seized the small town. The 1st Morava Division drove the 9th Infantry Division from its position and fought off the division's subsequent counterattack, inflicting heavy losses. The 4th Corps renewed its attack against the Šumadija Division, forcing the Serbs to withdraw having only sustained light casualties. Because the 4th Corps did not break the Serbs, the Austro-Hungarian division was unable to alter the direction of its advance towards Cer Mountain, since doing so <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> the Šumadija Division in a position to attack the 4th Corps from the rear. As a result, the 4th Corps was unable to join other Austro-Hungarian forces fighting at Cer.|$|E

However, unable to resist the pleasures he has been denied for so long, he eats, drinks and smokes far more than Lister ever <b>would</b> <b>have,</b> <b>putting</b> on quite a bit of weight in the process. Lister is naturally appalled and demands his heavily abused body back after just one week.|$|R

25|$|The Longhorns reached Trojan {{territory}} on {{the ensuing}} drive, with Young's 45-yard run constituting {{most of the}} work, but ultimately the Trojans forced a field-goal attempt from USC's 14-yard line, and, on the first play of the fourth quarter, Pino missed a 31-yard kick that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> his team ahead by two.|$|E
25|$|The toss was won by Mumbai. Their captain Rohit Sharma {{described}} the pitch as being drier {{than the previous}} match and predicted it would slow down as the match progressed. Chennai captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni also wanted to bat first as it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> pressure on the team chasing.

25|$|Still {{others have}} argued that war-weary Japan would likely have {{surrendered}} regardless, due to a collapse of the economy, lack of army, food, and industrial materials, threat of internal revolution, and talk of surrender since earlier in the year, while others find this unlikely, arguing that Japan may well have, or likely <b>would</b> <b>have,</b> <b>put</b> up a spirited resistance.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, both teams scored {{touchdown}}s and Nick Folk missed a 42-yard field goal which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> the Cowboys in front.
