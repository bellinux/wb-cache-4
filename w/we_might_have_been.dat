2500|$|Frederick Buechner's lifelong {{love affair}} with Bermuda began with his family's escape from the trauma of his father's suicide. [...] In Telling Secrets, Buechner {{described}} [...] "the blessed relief of {{coming out of the}} dark and unmentionable sadness of my father's life and death into fragrance and greenness and light." [...] Bermuda was [...] "a place where healing could happen in a way that perhaps {{would not have been possible}} anywhere else and to a degree that—even with all the endurance, will, courage <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to muster had we stayed —I do not think we could ever have achieved on our own." [...] For a child who had never known familial stability even before his father's death, Bermuda became home. [...] As Buechner explained, [...] "In that never-never land, that Oz of an island, where we had no roots, I found for the first time a sense of being rooted." [...] "All in all it seems to me, looking back, that I lived there with a greater sense of permanence than any place we had lived earlier." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a {{party of}} Ogres, the {{conversation}} assumed such a sanguine complexion.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{so happy}} together, Violet. Why didn't we meet sooner? I feel we're made for one another.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps, but {{for that}} delay, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> both <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shot,' said Louis. 'No, indeed; I could not wonder at your prizing it so much.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{monsieur}} {{had realized}} that he was no longer in Italy, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> perhaps <b>have</b> <b>been</b> spared this very foolish business," [...] answered Garnache testily.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait!" [...] cautioned Tarzan. [...] "If {{there are}} even fifty guns within the {{palisade}} we shall be repulsed and slaughtered. Let me go alone through the trees, so that I may look down upon them from above, and see just how many there be, and what chance <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>were</b> <b>we</b> to charge. It were foolish to lose a single man needlessly if there be no hope of success. I have an idea that we can accomplish more by cunning than by force. Will you wait, Waziri?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Think {{how easily}} <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> murdered and nobody been any the wiser!" [...] {{she said when}} they were comfortably {{outdoors}} again.|$|E
6000|$|... "If we {{had been}} {{sleeping}} in here when that happened, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> killed," [...] said Chet, and his chum agreed with him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, my Venetia!' exclaimed Herbert, {{pressing}} {{her to his}} breast, and in a voice stifled with emotion, 'I feel now <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> happy!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O dear! Then I am glad {{he is out}} of my house. Really! <b>we</b> <b>might</b> all <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{murdered in}} our beds!" [...] And the woman held up her thin hands in horror.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly <b>we</b> <b>might</b> all <b>have</b> <b>been</b> killed!" [...] said Mrs. Pope, {{feeling she}} had to bear her witness against their visitors, and added: [...] "If we hadn't {{moved out of the}} way, that is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mrs. Clibborn, I swear you're {{the only}} woman here who's got two ounces of gumption. If they'd only listened to you five years ago, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> all <b>have</b> <b>been</b> saved this awful wretchedness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{for a few}} hours, Mrs. Dishart. If this gypsy lassie had {{not given}} us so much trouble, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> gone by now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad of that. I mean, I'm glad we haven't {{been such}} fools as <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> You see, {{we only had}} Stanning's word to go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We are lost, dear Matthew,' said she, mournfully. 'We {{shall never}} find {{our way to}} the earth again. And oh how happy <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in our cottage!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't trust yourself. That's why you <b>were</b> silent, why <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{thought you}} <b>were</b> dead, why <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> perished ourselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is delicious, this frankness!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Ah! what a pity {{that you}} did not come before that other woman had {{destroyed}} all your faith! <b>We</b> <b>might,</b> perhaps, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> friends. Who can tell?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{the good}} of shirking the evil hour? I've lighted these candles for a sign of our return. After all, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> watched--while returning, I mean. Of course we were seen leaving the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Tom, {{they don't}} dare to take chances," [...] {{returned}} Nellie. [...] "Why, {{if we had}} gone on <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> showered with those stones we heard falling." ...|$|E
60|$|He even seemed {{offended}} at our remarks. He said he {{had picked}} us out the best boat in all his stock, and he thought <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> more grateful.|$|E
6000|$|... "Three-quarters of an hour, Professor. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> on time, only {{my cousin}} here {{slipped on the}} rocks and hurt his ankle, and that has delayed us a little." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The stream {{has risen}} a little, Baas, since I passed it this morning," [...] said Otter. [...] "Doubtless this day's sun has melted some snow at its source. To-morrow <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{able to travel}} this road." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{carry me}} with you," [...] said Daisy. [...] "Say, I think it's awful {{to be up}} so high that folks look like fleas. One of them <b>we</b> saw <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Joe. Why, Jiminy! <b>we</b> <b>might</b> as well be in New Jersey! Say, I'm afraid up here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes,” said Maccario, {{who stood}} up, “when it pleases him, and I {{think it is}} {{scarcely}} likely we shall sit at meat with him again. You will pledge a faithful comrade and a valiant soldier, without whom <b>we</b> <b>might</b> never <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the masters of Santa Marta.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not Providence, your Majesty, but our own negligence,' cried Saxon boldly. 'Had we {{advanced}} on Bristol last night, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> on {{the right}} side of the ramparts by now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Alas! with Time dear Love is dead, [...] And {{not with}} Fate. And who can guess [...] How weary of our {{happiness}} [...] <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{if we were}} wed? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are lost, dear Matthew," [...] said she, mournfully. [...] "We {{shall never}} find {{our way to}} the earth again. And oh how happy <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in our cottage!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will leave}} others {{to think of}} that. But, father, her guilt will not stain me. Are we not bound to {{remember}} what injury she <b>might</b> <b>have</b> done to us, and how <b>we</b> <b>might</b> still <b>have</b> <b>been</b> ignorant of all this, had not she herself confessed it--for our sakes--for our sakes, father?" ...|$|R
60|$|When we quitted the Chamois for the brigantine, we must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{at least}} two hundred leagues to the westward of the spot, where we had {{abandoned}} the Arcturion. Though how far <b>we</b> <b>might</b> then <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> North or South of the Equator, I could not with any certainty divine.|$|R
30|$|Thirdly, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to {{identify}} all relevant attitudes in our questionnaire. As there is a trade-off between including many questions and response rates, including additional questions comes at a cost. Although {{trying to keep the}} questionnaire as short as possible, the questionnaire includes the attitudes we considered most relevant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> on land {{long ago}} {{if we had}} turned to the left," [...] {{observed}} Frank. [...] "We may have been skirting the shore for half the afternoon!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, boys. I'm {{ready to}} wade in at once. Why ain't we {{on the road}} now? <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> but for foolin' our time away on that man Van Loo." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{heard of}} it several times, major. But we are not as bad off as <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> had the rebels put some sharp sticks down here to spit us with." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Irish Independent {{is full of}} praise, {{concluding}} [...] "This is {{the best}} novel I've read about Dublin in many years -- beautifully written, funny and touching in its remembered details and haunting in its suggestiveness about who <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> or <b>might</b> yet be as we make our befuddled yet hopeful way through life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They cannot {{enter the}} ship, {{though a few}} of them are {{hovering}} about us. But for the vigilance of Mr. Sharp, indeed, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> all <b>been</b> captured in our sleep. As it <b>is,</b> we <b>have</b> warning, and there is now little doubt of our being able to intimidate the few barbarians who have shown themselves, until Captain Truck shall return." ...|$|R
60|$|His {{salary was}} {{increased}} yesterday {{to one hundred}} and fifty pounds a year. If I only knew where Mr. Mallinson was, I would write and tell him of our present happiness. But for the situation which his kindness procured for Robert, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> still <b>have</b> <b>been</b> waiting vainly for the day that has now come.|$|R
