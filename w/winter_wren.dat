5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} by brown-headed cowbirds is common, {{with up to}} 25% of Carolina wren nests {{being affected}} in certain regions such as Oklahoma and Alabama. Cowbird parasitism peaks in April at 41%, and is as low as 8% and 0% in July and August, respectively. Female cowbirds sometimes eject Carolina wren eggs before laying their own, and even if host eggs are retained, the size of cowbird eggs negatively affect the hatching success of wren eggs. As a result, cowbirds may {{have a significant impact}} on the reproductive success of wrens. The feeding rate for cowbird nestlings is higher than wren feeding rates, and some have been raised to independence. This also can be detrimental to the survival of wren nestlings. A rare instance of brood-parasitism by a house finch has been recorded. The rate of brood parasitism is thought to be lower in more natural and concealed nesting locations. Body parasites such as the larvae of blowflies feed on nestlings and the blood loss weakens nestlings. Fellow species of wren such as Bewick's wren and the <b>winter</b> <b>wren</b> compete for nesting locations and food, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} the value of riparian areas adjacent to streams <= 10 -m wide as habitat for forest birds. In mature (80 - 120 years) and young (40 - 60 years) coastal forests of southern British Columbia, Canada, we examined the habitat values for male <b>winter</b> <b>wrens</b> [Troglodytes troglodytes] of riparian areas adjacent to small streams and areas upslope of these streams. In both riparian and upslope areas, wrens preferentially located nests (n= 47) and song perches (n= 77) in disturbed sites with fewer trees than randomly located sites. Hydrological processes associated with streams, mortality of dominant canopy trees or uprooted trees can produce these disturbed sites. In mature forest, <b>winter</b> <b>wrens</b> chose stream banks and upturned root masses when available for building their nests with most nest substrates located within 5 m of small streams. In both young and mature forests, they also chose areas near small streams as locations for song perches. <b>Winter</b> <b>wrens</b> may use areas closer to streams when available because channel morphology, the associated heterogeneous forest structure, and microclimate likely provide optimal nesting and foraging habitat. Our research supports operational efforts by forest managers to conserve structures near small streams and in upslope areas because these structures maintain long-term habitat values for wildlife such as <b>winter</b> <b>wrens.</b> Waterhouse et al "Use of small streams and forest gaps for breeding habitats by <b>winter</b> <b>wrens</b> in Coastal British Columbia.

40|$|In {{territorial}} contests, {{not only}} acoustic or other signals, {{but also the}} movements of a territorial intruder are likely to influence the response of a resident. 2. We tested this movement hypothesis by simulating moving vs. stationary intruders into the territories of <b>winter</b> <b>wrens</b> Troglodytes troglodytes, using the same non-interactive song playbacks in both treatments. 3. Male <b>winter</b> <b>wrens</b> showed a different long-term singing reaction {{in response to a}} moving than to a stationary intruder. 4. One day after experiencing an intruder that was switching between three locations, residents started to sing earlier before sunrise, and they sang more and longer songs at dawn than before the intrusion. 5. Residents receiving the same playback from one location only reacted by starting to sing later relative to sunrise, and by singing fewer and shorter songs than before the intrusion. 6. We could not discriminate between the treatments when examining the short-term singing reactions during and immediately after the playbacks. However, our results clearly demonstrate an effect of the spatial behaviour of territorial intruders on the long-term territory defence of residents at dawn, about 24 h after an intrusion. 7. We argue that spatial behaviour of territorial intruders should {{be an integral part of}} the study of animal territory defence behaviour. Investigating long-term changes in territory defence at dawn is a sensitive tool for discriminating between different types of intruders...|$|R

40|$|Territory defence {{can be seen}} as {{a dynamic}} {{long-term}} process that involves some learning. For example, a resident may adjust its territory proclamation behaviour depending on its prior experience with territorial intruders. We investigated whether short territorial challenges could have long-lasting effects on the singing behaviour of male birds. We used song playbacks to simulate intrusions into autumn territories of male <b>winter</b> <b>wrens,</b> Troglodytes troglodytes, shortly after dawn and compared male singing behaviour immediately before and I day after the simulated intrusion. As in many other bird species, unchallenged male wrens tended to sing more songs before than after sunrise. One day after a simulated intrusion, however, this pattern was much more pronounced. Males significantly increased their song output before sunrise, but maintained or even reduced song output after sunrise. This result suggests that dawn singing before sunrise is particularly important for territory defence. On the day after the intrusion, the start of dawn singing varied less between males, although the average starting time remained the same. Our findings suggest that a territorial challenge can influence singing behaviour almost 24 h after the intrusion. The amount and timing of birdsong, as a preventive territorial proclamation, can thus be adjusted to past territorial challenges...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 I studied species' abundances {{and habitat}} {{relationships}} of breeding and winter birds in commercially thinned and unthinned Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands from May 1989 to June 1991. The {{study was conducted}} in 40 - to 55 -year old stands in the Central Oregon Coast Ranges and the Tillamook State Forest. Total abundance and species diversity of breeding birds was greater in thinned stands. During the breeding season, Hammond's flycatchers (Empidonax hammondii), hairy woodpeckers (Picoides villosus), red-breasted nuthatches (Sitta canadensis), and dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) were more abundant in thinned than unthinned stands. Golden-crowned kinglets (Regulus satrapa), black-throated gray warblers (Dendroica nigrescens), and Pacific-slope flycatchers (Empidonax difficilis) were more abundant in unthinned stands. During the winter, red-breasted nuthatches and <b>winter</b> <b>wrens</b> (Troglodytes troglodytes) were more abundant in thinned stands. Differences in abundances of bird species between thinned and unthinned stands seemed to be related to differences in stand structure caused by thinning and to differences in hardwood densities that were probably unrelated to thinning. Differences in abundances of bird species between the Central Coast Ranges and the Tillamook State Forest were related to differences in shrub cover, and densities of hardwoods, snags, and conifers (> 56 cm dbh) between the 2 regions. I recommended a thinning regime that would encourage understory and hardwood development in combination with unthinned leave areas to provide snag recruitment and habitat for species associated with dense stands. This regime is intended to maximize bird diversity and abundance in 40 - to 55 - year-old Douglas-fir stands in western Oregon...|$|R
