5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the moon in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit {{to make it look}} like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> behind the painted moon, as a source for lighting.|$|E
5|$|Petrol cans {{were stacked}} {{along the sides}} of {{existing}} revetted trenches near El Alamein railway station. It was found by experiment that when they <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> in the shadows in that way, they were invisible from the air and so 2000 tons of petrol were thus stored. Over 100,000 four-gallon petrol tins were stacked in the 100 stone-faced slit trenches.|$|E

5|$|The {{fossils of}} the Burgess Shale <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> in store rooms until the 1960s. When Whittington {{and his colleagues}} first began to publish their Burgess finds in the early 1970s, the fossils became central to the debate about how quickly animals arose, and were {{interpreted}} as evidence that all the living bilaterian phyla {{had appeared in the}} Early Cambrian, along with many other phyla that had become extinct {{by the end of the}} Cambrian.|$|E
5|$|The radar {{contacts}} were, in fact, {{the approaching}} 31 Japanese torpedo bombers, who circled {{around to the}} south of TF18 so that they could attack from the east, with the black backdrop of the eastern sky behind them. From this direction, the Japanese bombers <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> by the night sky, but Giffen's ships were silhouetted against the twilight of the western horizon. The 705AG aircraft attacked first, beginning at 19:19. Nakamura's aircraft missed with all of their torpedoes and one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships.|$|E
5|$|Two rioters <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> in Lakenheath by a {{labourer}} {{who eventually}} betrayed them for £5 each (£). One rioter, William Gotobed, a bricklayer, escaped and was eventually pardoned {{a few years}} later. He returned to Littleport after seven years {{and then went to}} America. The rioting spread to nearby areas such as Little Downham, Cambridgeshire, although such areas were not as badly affected. It took until 10 June before the areas were finally cleared of trouble and all of the rioters had been captured.|$|E

50|$|In {{the weeks}} before his arrest, Hadžić {{disappeared}} {{from his home in}} Novi Sad, Serbia. In 2005, Serbian media reported he might <b>be</b> <b>hiding</b> in a Serbian Orthodox monastery in Irig or in Bijela, Montenegro. Nenad Čanak, the leader of the League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina, claimed in 2006 that Hadžić <b>was</b> <b>hiding</b> in a monastery somewhere on Fruška mountain. At one point he was also rumoured to <b>be</b> <b>hiding</b> in Belarus.|$|R
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1942, when there were fears of a German victory in the Middle East, Mishmar HaEmek {{was used as a}} {{training}} camp by the British army. 160 Jewish volunteers, who would later become members of the Palmach branch of the Haganah, were trained by Royal Engineers in sabotage and wireless operation. Several tons of explosives <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> in caches in case the area came under German occupation. This program was terminated immediately upon the training of the volunteers, and orders issued for the collection of all equipment and explosives to be returned to the British.|$|E
5|$|Jaffe {{noted that}} the low-tech method of {{suspending}} actors by wires helped the final effect, because as photographed by John Fante, few wires {{had to be removed}} digitally in post-production; sets were constructed so that the harsh lighting obscured wires, and entire sets were constructed on their sides so that by pulling actors {{up and down on the}} rotated sets, the characters appeared to float sideways. These sets were on gimbals so that the movement of the actors and sets created a floating effect. The shot of two Klingons killed and thrown back down a corridor by phaser blasts was simulated by positioning the camera at the bottom of a corridor set. The set was placed on its end in the tallest soundstage at Paramount, so that the camera looked up towards the ceiling. In this position, the wires <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> by the actors as they ascended the corridor.|$|E
5|$|TNA held a No Disqualification {{match between}} Abyss, who was {{accompanied}} by James Mitchell, and Sabu next. Its duration was 11 minutes and 30 seconds. This was originally promoted as Abyss versus Sabu, however, a No Disqualification stipulation was added during the event. In a No Disqualification match, weapons are legal, as well as outside interference, with a victor determined only by pinfall or submission. In the final minutes, Abyss retrieved a bag of thumbtacks which <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> under the ring. He then poured the contents onto the ring mat before slamming Sabu back-first into the tacks with his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver.|$|E

5|$|The Soviets {{employed}} maskirovka (military deception) to mask defensive {{positions and}} troop dispositions and {{to conceal the}} movement of men and materiel. These included camouflaging gun emplacements, constructing dummy airfields and depots, generating false radio-traffic, and spreading rumours among the Soviet frontline troops and the civilian population in the German-held areas. Movement of forces and supplies {{to and from the}} salient took place at night only. Ammunition caches were carefully concealed to blend in with the landscape. Radio transmission was restricted and fires were forbidden. Command posts <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> and motor transport in and around them forbidden.|$|E
5|$|The imprisoned {{soldiers}} {{received two}} {{meals a day}} of steamed rice, occasionally accompanied by fruit, soup, or meat. To supplement their diet, prisoners were able to smuggle food and supplies hidden in their underwear into the camp during Japanese-approved trips to Cabanatuan. To prevent extra food, jewelry, diaries, and other valuables from being confiscated, items <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> in clothing or latrines, or were buried before scheduled inspections. Prisoners collected food {{using a variety of}} methods including stealing, bribing guards, planting gardens, and killing animals which entered the camp such as mice, snakes, ducks, and stray dogs. The Filipino underground collected thousands of quinine tablets to smuggle into the camp to treat malaria, saving hundreds of lives.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors <b>were</b> <b>hidden.</b> These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E

5000|$|The {{book was}} written {{as a set}} of riddles that would lead the {{treasure}} hunters to the treasure hidden by Bladkompaniet AS, the publisher of the novel. Competitors searched for the treasure, which had <b>been</b> <b>hidden</b> somewhere in Norway. In the [...] "treasure", a telephone number <b>was</b> <b>hidden,</b> which the lucky winner called to claim the prize. The treasure was found 11 October 1999. Margit Sandemo said in a TV-interview that even she hadnt known where the treasure had <b>been</b> <b>hidden.</b>|$|R
50|$|Faceted mode. In {{this mode}} each surface is drawn {{as a series}} of planar regions, usually rectangles. Hidden line removal is {{typically}} used with such a representation. Static hidden line removal does not update which lines <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> during rotation, but only once the screen <b>is</b> refreshed. Dynamic <b>hidden</b> line removal continuously updates which curves <b>are</b> <b>hidden</b> during rotations.|$|R
5|$|The {{location}} {{was not an}} easy place to defend without artillery, as the plains made surprise attacks difficult. Except for the convent itself, the terrain did not offer any natural barriers that the patriots could exploit. Nevertheless, the flat terrain was ideal for cavalry manoeuvres, and the distance between the church and the west gully gave enough room for a cavalry charge. The royalists, on the other hand, could support their troops with their ships from the river. Without a supporting navy, or local batteries, San Martín had no means to attack the ships. Although the small path allowed them passage to the ships, it could force the royalist forces to bottleneck during a retreat while the long range guns of the ships protected them. San Martín studied the battlefield and readied the plan for the operation during the night, when the grenadiers <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> inside the convent.|$|E
5|$|The valley {{also seems}} to have {{suffered}} an official plundering during the virtual civil war, which started {{during the reign of}} Ramesses XI. The tombs were opened, all the valuables were removed, and the mummies were collected into two large caches. One in the tomb of Amenhotep II, contained sixteen, and others <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> within Amenhotep I's tomb. A few years later most of them were moved to the Deir el-Bahri cache, containing no fewer than forty royal mummies and their coffins. Only tombs whose locations were lost (KV62, KV63 and KV46, although both KV62 and KV46 were robbed soon after their actual closure) were undisturbed during this period.|$|E
5|$|Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) warns the FBI and BATF that Ephesian and {{his wives}} will be {{released}} in a day unless they can track down Sidney and the Temple's reported weapons cache. The agents question Ephesian, who states {{that there is no}} member of the temple named Sidney. When they interview Melissa, she suddenly begins to talk like Sidney, claiming that Harry Truman is president. Scully believes Melissa is exhibiting multiple personality disorder, but Mulder thinks she is recalling a past life. The agents take her back to the temple, where she takes on the personality of a woman from the Civil War period and says that the weapons <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> in another secret bunker in the field. She also states that Mulder, in a past life, was a Confederate soldier in the field with her, her beloved, and she watched him die.|$|E

5|$|During the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453) the château was {{occupied}} several {{times by the}} English. It was demolished in 1442, but was soon rebuilt using the original stones. In the religious wars of 16th and 17th centuries the château was a base for Huguenot forces, and in 1650 it was partly demolished by royal troops. Another château was erected but it received extensive damage in a fire in 1793 during the French Revolution. The château was renovated in the romantic style after the Bourbon Restoration of 1815, and has been extensively modified since then. During World War II (1939–45) the château housed French troops and refugees from Alsace-Lorraine in 1940 and for several months it was partially occupied by some German units. In 1944 {{some members of the}} maquis <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> there. The château was listed as a monument historique on 31 March 1966, and obtained full protection on 19 November 2010.|$|E
5|$|Employing {{elements}} of the 84th and 106th Line, the French wing commander ordered the troops not to press home their assault, but to retreat every time they came against strong resistance. Each attack was pushed farther up the ridge before receding into the valley. When the fifth assault in regimental strength gave way, the defenders finally reacted, sweeping down the slope {{to cut off the}} French. Saint-Cyr now sprung his trap. Lecourbe led the massed grenadier companies to attack one Austrian flank, other reserves bored in on the other flank and the center counterattacked. The French troops that struck the Austrian right <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> in the nearby town of Herrenalb. As the Austrians gave way, the French followed them up the ridge right into their positions. Nevertheless, Kaim's men laid down such a heavy fire that Lecourbe's grenadiers were thrown into disorder and their leader nearly captured. At length, Saint-Cyr's troops emerged triumphant, inflicting 1,000 casualties on their opponents and capturing two cannons. Kaim was compelled to withdraw east across the hills to Neuenbürg. From there, Kaim and Lindt's soldiers fell back toward Pforzheim.|$|E
5|$|In Puerto Rico {{there were}} many minor slave revolts in which the slaves clashed with the {{military}} establishment. In July 1821, Marcos Xiorro, a bozal slave, planned and organized a conspiracy against the slave masters and the colonial government of Puerto Rico. According to his plot, {{which was to be}} carried out on July 27, during the festival celebrations for Santiago (St. James), several slaves were to escape from various plantations in Bayamón, which included the haciendas of Angus McBean, C. Kortnight, Miguel Andino and Fernando Fernández. They were then to proceed to the sugarcane fields of Miguel Figueres, and retrieve cutlasses and swords which <b>were</b> <b>hidden</b> in those fields. Xiorro, together with a slave from the McBean plantation named Mario and another slave named Narciso, would lead the slaves of Bayamón and Toa Baja and capture the city of Bayamón. They would then burn the city and kill those who were not black. After this, they would all unite with slaves from the adjoining towns of Río Piedras, Guaynabo and Palo Seco. With this critical mass of slaves, all armed and emboldened from a series of quick victories, they would then invade the capital city of San Juan, where they would declare Xiorro as their king. Unfortunately for the slave conspirators, the plot was divulged by a fellow slave to the authorities.|$|E

In a more difficult version, the flag <b>is</b> <b>hidden</b> in a place where it can only be seen from one angle. It also might have some challenge involved. For example, the flag could <b>be</b> <b>hidden</b> in the leaves up in a tall tree, and the players have to see the flag, then knock it out and bring it to their base.|$|R
