5000|$|Atractyloside is {{synthesized}} by some {{plant species}} e.g. the <b>distaff</b> <b>thistle</b> (...) from the Asteraceae family. Further plants, {{also from the}} family of the Asteraceae, are the species: Callilepis laureola, Xanthium strumarium, Iphiona alsoeri, and Pascalia glauca.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Distaff</b> <b>thistle,</b> Atractylis gummifera, {{native to}} the Greek island of Crete, is called kollies (κολλιές), akolletes (ακολλέτες), sakizi (σακίζι), kollotsoure (κολλοτσουρέ) or agathokollia (αγκαθοκολλιά) {{by the people of}} the island, They often eat peel and the heads raw or browned ...|$|R
50|$|Carthamus leucocaulos, the whitestem <b>distaff</b> <b>thistle</b> or {{glaucous}} starthistle, is {{a species}} of flowering plant in the daisy family. It is native to Greece and the Aegean. It is known in California and Western Australia as an introduced species and a noxious weed.|$|R
50|$|As namesake {{member of}} the {{subtribe}} Centaureinae of tribe Cynareae, the knapweeds are probably most closely related to genera such as Carthamus (<b>distaff</b> <b>thistles),</b> Cnicus (blessed thistle), Crupina (crupinas) or Notobasis (Syrian thistle), and somewhat less closely to most other thistles. The monotypic Cnicus seems in fact to properly belong in Centaurea.|$|R
50|$|The {{poisonous}} {{effect of}} the <b>distaff</b> <b>thistle</b> (due to atractyloside) is documented in history. The plant growing in the Mediterranean region was therefore often used for suicide or murder. Examples of accidental poisoning are documented in Italy and Algeria in 1955 and 1975 respectively, where children have eaten parts of the plant.|$|R

Please look for up-to-date information in the OSU Extension Catalog: [URL] thistle is sometimes called wooly <b>distaff</b> <b>thistle,</b> and in Australia it is Saffron thistle.

40|$|Aulacidea kiefferi Cotte, 1915, a cynipid {{species that}} induces gall {{formation}} {{on the plant}} Carthamus lanatus L., known only from a single old record from France, was recently re-discovered in a locality south-east of Madrid (central Spain). In this study, we re-describe the species, including a new description of the male and the terminal larva. We transfer the species to the genus Phanacis, and provide a key for the identifi-cation of the related West European Phanacis species. P. kiefferi might potentially {{be used as an}} agent for the biological control of the host plant, C. lanatus, the saffron or <b>distaff</b> <b>thistle,</b> a harmful weed native to the Mediterranean Region, with a virtually worldwide current distribution...|$|R
5000|$|Carthamus lanatus is {{a species}} of thistle known as woolly <b>distaff</b> <b>thistle,</b> downy {{safflower}} or saffron thistle. It {{is closely related to}} safflower, which is in the same genus. This annual plant is a native of the Mediterranean Basin, but it is familiar in other places where it was introduced and has become a noxious weed, such as in parts of North America and southern Australia [...] with similar climates. This is a spiny, glandular, woolly plant, which often looks like it is covered in spiderweb due to its fine tangled fibers. It has a pale stem which may reach a meter in height, and rigid, pointed, very spiny leaves. The flower head has many long, sharp phyllaries that can be up to several centimeters long, and often bend backwards (recurved). The disc florets are bright yellow. One plant can produce many stems which mat together due to their spininess and form a small thicket. The fruit is an achene about half a centimeter long with many rigid pappus scales.|$|R
