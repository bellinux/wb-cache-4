5|$|As 91 {{votes are}} needed to elect the Governor from the 180-member body and Democrats and Progressives held 112 seats, it was {{considered}} unlikely that Milne would win. Milne argued that legislators should decide the election in line with how their individual districts voted. Neal Goswami of the Vermont Press Bureau calculated that if each legislator voted according to the results in their district, the vote <b>would</b> <b>result</b> in a 90–90 tie. Milne disagreed with this calculation and claimed voting according to district outcome <b>would</b> <b>result</b> in his winning 93–87.|$|E

He proposed a wide range of budget austerity measures, including employee furloughing, spending reductions, freezing state hiring, freezing state employee wages, and a host of administrative changes for state agencies. The state had already been gradually reducing its workforce by similar freezes, and by 2011, Indiana had the fewest state employees per capita than any other state—a figure Daniels touted to say Indiana had the nation's smallest government.|$|E

5|$|A key {{question}} surrounding the FairTax {{is whether the}} tax {{has the ability to}} be revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax <b>would</b> <b>result</b> in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different tax rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.|$|E

A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.|$|E
