They later married and emigrated to the United States in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Salinger was romantically {{involved}} with television actress Elaine Joyce {{for several years}} in the 1980s. The relationship ended <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>met</b> Colleen O'Neill (b. June 11, 1959), a nurse and quiltmaker, whom he married around 1988. O'Neill, forty years his junior, once told Margaret Salinger that she and Salinger were {{trying to have a}} child.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus. The actor {{was tired}} of doing {{independent}} films where his expectations were not met; <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>met</b> with director Bryan Singer, he went into a 15-minute tirade telling him {{what it was like}} to work with him. After Baldwin was finished, Singer told him exactly what he expected and wanted, which impressed the actor.|$|E

5|$|Although Manekshaw was conferred {{the rank}} of field marshal in 1973, it was {{reported}} that he was not given the complete allowances that he was entitled to as a field marshal. It was not until President A. P. J.

5|$|As the {{situation}} around Bihać deteriorated for the ARBiH, {{the government of}} the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina realized that it could not hold the area on its own and asked Croatia for military intervention. ARBiH Chief of Staff Rasim Delić appealed to the HV and the HVO to assist the ARBiH 5th Corps on 20 July, proposing HV attacks towards Bosansko Grahovo, Knin and Vojnić. His plea was supported by President of Turkey Süleyman Demirel <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>met</b> Croatian President Franjo Tuđman in the Brijuni Islands the next day.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin's {{loneliness}} {{was relieved}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>met</b> 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and the pair began a successful relationship. He {{was not ready}} to commit to a film, however, and focused on writing a serial about his travels (published in Woman's Home Companion). The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested in world affairs. The state of labour in America troubled him, and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.|$|E

5|$|Daniel and Nicholas Caffell (born 22 June 1979, six {{when they}} died) {{were born to}} Sheila and Colin Caffell, who married in 1977 and {{divorced}} in 1980. Colin was an art student <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>met</b> Sheila. Both parents {{were involved in the}} children's upbringing after the divorce, although the boys were briefly placed in foster care in London, in 1982 and 1983, because of Sheila's health problems. For several months before the murders, they had been living with Colin in his home in Kilburn, north London, not far from Sheila's home in Maida Vale.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Venkata Reddy had Akkineni Nageswara Rao in {{mind for}} the lead role. He later wanted to cast Raja Reddy in the lead role but {{replaced}} him with N. T. Rama Rao in the last minute, who made his debut by playing a minor character in Mana Desam (1949). Rama Rao was eventually signed {{as a part of}} his four-film contract with Vijaya Vauhini Studios after Venkata Reddy was impressed with Rama Rao <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>met</b> him on the sets of Samsaram (1950). With this film, Rama Rao became the first actor to have acted in two languages simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|Boganda's {{attachment}} to his chosen calling weakened <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>met</b> {{and fell in}} love with a young Frenchwoman, Michelle Jourdain, who was employed as a parliamentary secretary. They were married on 13 June 1950, for which Boganda was expelled from the priesthood and cut off from the Catholic hierarchy's support. Boganda and Jourdain would later have two daughters and a son. The affair caused a minor scandal in Paris, but it did little to dent his popularity with his people. In the National Assembly he continued to battle, often in vain, against repressive features of the French administration in Oubangui-Chari. Arbitrary arrest, low wages, compulsory cotton cultivation, and the exclusion of blacks from restaurants and cinemas were all targets of his rhetoric.|$|E
5|$|St. Gatien {{returned}} to Newmarket on October 12 {{to attempt to}} win a second Cesarewitch. On this occasion, he was assigned a weight of 131 pounds, twenty-three pounds {{more than any of}} the seventeen other runners. He made little show in the race and finished unplaced behind Stone Clink. Two days later, St. Gatien was given a chance to redeem his reputation <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>met</b> Stone Clink again in Her Majesty's Plate over two miles. This race was at level weights and St. Gatien had no difficulty justifying his position as 4/9 favourite, taking the lead a furlong from the finish and winning very easily by three lengths.|$|E
5|$|Explorer Samuel de Champlain was {{the first}} European to record an {{encounter}} with Ottawa speakers <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>met</b> a party of three hundred Ottawas in 1615 {{on the north shore}} of Georgian Bay. French missionaries, particularly members of the Society of Jesus and the Récollets order, documented several dialects of Ojibwe in the 17th and 18th centuries, including unpublished manuscript Ottawa grammatical notes, word lists, and a dictionary. In the 19th century, Ottawa speaker Andrew Blackbird wrote a history of the Ottawa people that included a description of Ottawa grammatical features. The first linguistically accurate work was Bloomfield's description of Ottawa as spoken at Walpole Island, Ontario. The Odawa Language Project at the University of Toronto, led by Kaye and Piggott, conducted field work in Ottawa communities on Manitoulin Island in the late 1960s and early 1970s, resulting in a series of reports on Ottawa linguistics. Piggott also prepared a comprehensive description of Ottawa phonology. Rhodes produced a study of Ottawa syntax, a dictionary, and a series of articles on Ottawa grammar. Valentine has published a comprehensive descriptive grammar, a volume of texts including detailed analysis, as well as a survey of Ojibwe dialects that includes extensive description and analysis of Ottawa dialect features.|$|E

5|$|Holmes {{had served}} under Kit Carson and John C. Fremont, {{but he was}} old and {{physically}} impaired <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>met</b> Burnham. He had lost all of his family in the Indian wars and before he died he wanted to impart {{his knowledge of the}} frontier to the young Burnham. The two men traveled throughout the American Southwest and northern Mexico, and Holmes taught him many scouting skills, such as how to track a trail, how to double and cover one's own trail, how to properly ascend and descend precipices, and how to tell the time at night. Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such as where to find water in the desert, how to protect himself from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. A stickler for details, Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest things, such as braiding a rope, tying a knot, or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way. The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting. Burnham also worked as a cowboy, a guard for the mines, a guide, and a scout during these years.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Murray {{suffered}} a first round loss at the Australian Open to eventual runner-up Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, {{and a third}} round loss at the French Open to Nicolás Almagro. Murray then made his first Grand Slam quarterfinal at Wimbledon before making his first final at the US Open. During the tournament in New York, Murray claimed his first win over Nadal. That victory meant that he'd become the first player from Britain since Greg Rusedski in 1997 to reach a major final. In his first Grand Slam final Murray {{suffered a}} straight sets loss to Federer. At the Beijing Olympics, Murray suffered {{one of the worst}} defeats of his career, losing his first round singles match to world No. 77 Yen-hsun Lu of Taiwan in straight sets. That abject defeat was still on his mind in a BBC interview five years later – despite an intervening Olympic gold medal and a head-to-head win – <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>met</b> the same player (now ranked 75 in the world) in the 2nd round of Wimbledon 2013.|$|E
5|$|In 550, he {{was sent}} as envoy by Justinian to {{negotiate}} a peace treaty with Persia, a role he reprised in 561, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>met</b> the Persian envoy Izedh Gushnap at Dara, to end the Lazic War. Reaching an agreement over the Persian evacuation of Lazica and the delineation of the border in Armenia, the two envoys concluded a fifty-year peace between the two empires and their respective allies. The annual Roman subsidies to Persia would resume, but the amount was lowered from 500 to 420 pounds of gold. Further clauses regulated cross-border trade, {{which was to be}} limited to the two cities of Dara and Nisibis, the return of fugitives, and the protection of the respective religious minorities (Christians in the Persian Empire and Zoroastrians in Byzantium). In exchange for Persian recognition for the existence of Dara, whose construction had originally sparked a brief war, the Byzantines agreed to limit their troops there and remove the seat of the magister militum per Orientem from the city. As disagreements remained on two border areas, Suania and Ambros, in spring 562, Peter travelled to Persia to negotiate directly with the Persian Shah, Chosroes I, without however achieving a result. He then returned to Constantinople, where he died sometime after March 565.|$|E

5|$|Pound was 36 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>met</b> the 26-year-old American violinist Olga Rudge in Paris in late 1922, {{beginning}} {{a love affair}} that lasted 50 years. Biographer John Tytell believes Pound had always felt that his creativity and ability to seduce women were linked, something Dorothy had {{turned a blind eye}} to over the years. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he complained that he had been there for three months without having managed to find a mistress. He was introduced to Olga at a musical salon hosted by American heiress Natalie Barney in her home at 20 Rue Jacob, near the Boulevard Saint-Germain. The two moved in different social circles: Olga was the daughter of a wealthy Youngstown, Ohio, steel family, living in her mother's Parisian apartment on the Right Bank, socializing with aristocrats, while his friends were mostly impoverished writers of the Left Bank. They spent the following summer in the south of France, where Pound worked with George Antheil to apply the concept of Vorticism to music, and managed to write two operas, including Le Testament de Villon. He wrote pieces for solo violin, which Olga performed.|$|E
5|$|John Herschel Glenn Jr. {{was born}} on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, the son of John Herschel Glenn Sr., who worked for a {{plumbing}} firm, and Clara Teresa , a teacher. His parents had married shortly before his father, {{a member of the}} American Expeditionary Force, left for the Western Front during World War I. The family moved to New Concord, Ohio, soon after his birth, and his father started his own plumbing company, the Glenn Plumbing Company. He was only a toddler <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>met</b> Anna Margaret (Annie) Castor, who would later become his wife. The two {{would not be able to}} recall a time when they did not know each other. He took his first flight in an airplane with his father when he was eight years old. He became fascinated by flight, and built model airplanes from balsa wood kits. Along with his adopted sister Jean, he attended New Concord Elementary School. He washed cars and sold rhubarb to earn money to buy a bicycle, after which he took a job delivering The Columbus Dispatch newspaper. He was a member of the Ohio Rangers, an organisation similar to the Cub Scouts; Annie was a girl scout. His boyhood home in New Concord has been restored as a historic house museum and education center.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the three}} kings, Máel Coluim {{appears to have}} been the most powerful, and it is {{possible}} that Mac Bethad and Echmarcach were underkings or clientkings of his. Mac Bethad appears to have become Mormaer of Moray in 1032 after the slaying of his kinsman, Gilla Comgáin mac Máel Brigti, Mormaer of Moray (died 1032). Previous rulers of Moray are sometimes styled as kings by various Irish annals, a fact which may explain why Mac Bethad was called a king <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>met</b> Knútr. Although the apparent date of Mac Bethad's accession to the mormaership (1032) appears to contradict the date of the kings' meeting (1031), this discrepancy can be accounted for in two ways. One possibility is that Gilla Comgáin was actually slain in 1031 but only recorded in 1032. Another possibility is that Knútr merely returned from Rome in 1031, but actually met with the kings in 1032, after Gilla Comgáin's demise and Mac Bethad's accession. There is further evidence that could cast doubt on the date of the meeting. Although the aforesaid versions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle date Knútr's pilgrimage to 1031, he is otherwise known to have visited Rome in 1027. Whilst it is possible he undertook two pilgrimages during his career, {{it is more likely that}} the chronicle has misdated his journey. In fact, it possible that the chronicle failed to account for the time in which Knútr spent on the continent and Scandinavia after having visited Rome.|$|E
