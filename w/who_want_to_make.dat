2500|$|Pinotage, a {{crossing}} of Pinot noir and Cinsaut, {{has seen its}} plantings rise and fall due to the current fashion of the South African wine industry. Today, {{it is the second}} most widely planted red grape variety in South Africa. While there are supporters <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the grape South Africa's signature variety, critics of the grape note that hardly any other wine region in the world has planted this variety due to its flaws. In the early 1990s, as Apartheid ended and the world's wine market was opening up, winemakers in South Africa ignored Pinotage in favour of more internationally recognised varieties like Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon. Towards the end of the 20th century, the grape's fortunes began to turn, and by 1997 it commanded higher prices than any other South African grape. It is a required component (30–70%) in [...] "Cape blends". Here it is made into the full range of styles, from easy-drinking quaffing wine and rosé to barrel-aged wine intended for cellaring. It is also made into a fortified [...] "port-style", and even a red sparkling wine. The grape can be very dependent on the style of winemaking, with well made examples having the potential to produce deep coloured, fruity wines that can be accessible early as well as age. However, critics of the variety believe that the variety's flaws - green vegetal flavours and tannins, and susceptibility to developing banana and nail polish acetate aromas - are present in far more examples of Pinotage that reach the consumer market. Pinotage reached its zenith in 2001, covering 7.3% of the total vineyard area, but this has since decreased to 6%.|$|E

Ah, Messer Greco, {{if you want to know}} the flavour of our scholarship, you must frequent my shop: it is the focus of Florentine intellect, and in that sense the navel of the earth--as my great predecessor, Burchiello, said of his shop, on the more frivolous pretension that his street of the Calimara was the centre of our city.
