The value of mean diurnal temperature range is increasing. The duration of the frost period is decreasing, on the contrary, the lenght of the growing season is prolonging. 36 % of the absolute extremes of maximal daily temperature were detected in the period 1996 - 2010. On the other hand, the absolute extremes of minimal daily temperature are rare in this period. The sub-seasonal anomalies are three or more days long significant deviations from the smoothed annual progress of the air temperature. This anomalies of the air temperature has highest mean value of deviations and longest mean duration in winter.

40|$|Since Kydland and Prescott {{published}} their influential work in 1982, {{the literature}} on monetary real business cycle models has proved its ability to account for regularities in the data for developed countries. 1 Few works, however, attempt {{to do so for}} emerging Latin American economies. 2 The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine how well a money-in-the-utility-function model with a Taylor rule can match some particular monetary stylized facts from the Chilean data between 1986 and 2000. In particular, it focuses on a theoretical explanation for what the empiri-cal literature calls the price puzzle, namely, the comovement between the interest rate and the inflation rate. This is considered a puzzle be-cause the traditional Mundell-Fleming model predicts that a positive change in the interest rate—that is, a restrictive monetary policy—should cause a decrease in private spending and thus a fall in the inflation rate. The price puzzle is a relationship found in many VAR-type esti-mates for Chile and other economies. Morandé and Schmidt-Hebbel (1997) are the first authors to find a statistically significant price puzzle for the Chilean economy.

Robot's mechanical construction {{is based on}} aluminium profiles supported by various standardized assembly units, such as rotating bearings, plain bearings, threaded rods [...] . The front-end part of the robot, which requires better deformation property and lighter weight, was made from ABS material using 3 D rapid prototyping technology. The design of the robot allows its body to rotate around three axises. Thanks to the high dynamical ability, robot can be set to throw balls to various places on the playing table, with different types of ball spin. Balls will be shot out by two rubber wheels, which are attached to two electrical DC motors. By driving {{the speed of the}} two motors, we can control the speed of the ball, as well as speed of its spin. All robot's activities are driven by an embedded system designed using microcontroller ATMega 128. A firmware for controlling robot's function <b>was</b> <b>writen</b> and flashed into the microcontroller. End-users might communicate with the robot via a system of buttons and a text LCD display.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{framework}} for studying the choice of exchange rate regime in an open economy where the local currency is vulnerable to speculative attacks. The optimal regime is determined by a policymaker who trades off the loss from nominal exchange rate uncertainty, against the cost of maintaining a given regime. This cost is affected in turn by {{the likelihood of a}} speculative attack. Searching for the optimal regime within the class of exchange rate bands, we show that the optimal regime is either a peg (a zero-width band), a free float (an infinite-width band), or a non degenerate finite width band. In the latter case, the exchange rate is allowed to move freely only within a band set around some center rate. We examine the determinants of the optimal band width and show, among other things, that, ceteris paribus, lower costs of moving across currencies induce policymakers to set more flexible exchange rate systems. This lowers, in turn, the likelihood of financial crises. More generally the framework of the paper can be used to shed new light on the recent world wide trend towards a bipolar system of exchange rate arrangements. ∗We would like to acknowledge useful discussions with Ron McKinnon and Assaf Razin.
