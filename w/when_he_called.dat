5|$|Olajuwon {{emigrated from}} Nigeria to play {{basketball}} at the University of Houston under Cougars coach Guy Lewis. Olajuwon was not highly recruited and was merely offered {{a visit to the}} university to work out for the coaching staff, based on a recommendation from a friend of Lewis who had seen Olajuwon play. He later recalled that when he originally arrived at the airport in 1980 for the visit, no representative of the school was there to greet him. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> the staff, they told him to take a taxi out to the university.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Carroll {{was elected}} to the Kentucky Senate from District 7, {{defeating}} Harold Fletcher – the older brother of then-governor Ernie Fletcher – by a wide margin. The district included all or portions of Anderson, Fayette, Franklin, and Woodford counties. He made headlines in 2007 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> on Fletcher's lieutenant governor, Steve Pence, to resign for his disloyalty after Pence endorsed Anne Northup in the Republican gubernatorial primary rather than backing Fletcher's re-election bid. Pence refused to resign, citing an investigation of the administration's hiring practices as his reason for refusing to endorse Fletcher. Fletcher won the Republican primary, but lost in the general election to Democrat Steve Beshear.|$|E
5|$|The English Parliament distrusted Charles's motivations <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> {{for funds}} {{to put down}} the Irish rebellion; many members of the Commons {{suspected}} that forces raised by Charles might later be used against Parliament itself. Pym's Militia Bill was intended to wrest control of the army from the king, but it did not have the support of the Lords, let alone Charles. Instead, the Commons passed the bill as an ordinance, which they claimed did not require royal assent. The Militia Ordinance appears to have prompted more members of the Lords to support the king. In an attempt to strengthen his position, Charles generated great antipathy in London, which was already fast falling into anarchy, when he placed the Tower of London under the command of Colonel Thomas Lunsford, an infamous, albeit efficient, career officer. When rumours reached Charles that Parliament intended to impeach his wife for supposedly conspiring with the Irish rebels, the king decided to take drastic action.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks after}} Gui's disappearance, four men came to search his {{apartment}} – ostensibly for his computer – but left without it. A manager from the estate where Gui lived attempted to contact Gui {{on the number}} of the person who called her last regarding Gui. A taxi driver answered, saying that four men had left the telephone in the taxi, and that they had wanted to go to Poipet, a border town in Cambodia. Gui was last heard from on 6 November <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> his wife to tell her that he was safe but was unwilling to reveal his whereabouts. The Thai authorities have no record of Gui leaving the country. Gui's family contacted the Swedish embassy, and the Swedish police filed a report through Interpol. The Guardian observed that the Thai government had done little to advance the case, noting that the military junta was becoming increasingly accommodating to Chinese demands.|$|E

Although remaining in England, he {{commented on the}} 1924–25 Ashes series for the Sunday Express and became involved in an argument which arose during the tour over the merits of professional captaincy; Fender believed professionals would make good captains. He also wrote about the 1926 series, and drew criticism from Australians <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> their sportsmanship into question. He later wrote regularly for the Evening News and The Star; to the irritation of other journalists, {{he became the first}} man to use a typewriter in the press box.|$|E
5|$|About January 1944, Moyzisch hired a new {{secretary}} named Cornelia Kapp, {{also known}} as Nele Kapp, who had spied for the British and Americans in exchange for permission to immigrate to the United States. She had worked at the Germany embassy in Sofia, Bulgaria beginning in July 1943 and within a month had become a spy. In January 1944, she moved to Ankara {{to work at the}} German embassy under Moyzisch. Kapp was asked by the OSS to learn about the spy that Moyzisch met with. Kapp was adept at gathering intelligence within the office. She flirted with Cicero <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> the office to schedule a meeting with Moyzisch. When she could, Kapp also followed the two men to try to see what the spy looked like, but was unsuccessful at getting a good view of him. Kapp had gathered and shared a lot of information with the OSS over the months that she worked at the embassy, including all that she felt that she could learn about Cicero.|$|E
5|$|Gui Minhai (桂民海, age 51) is a Swedish {{national}} {{and one of}} the three shareholders of Mighty Current. He was taken away from his home in Pattaya, Thailand by an unknown man on 17 October 2015. Gui had written some 200 books during his ten years as author/publisher. He kept his movements to himself and his communications routed, and his work projects would also be shrouded in secrecy. Gui has not set foot inside the PRC for a long period – he never attended to his father when he was ill, and did not return upon his death. It is known that his home in Thailand was later searched by four Chinese men, who attempted to seize Gui's computer. A manager from the estate where Gui lived, in an effort to contact Gui, dialled the number that last called her regarding Gui, to be told by a taxi driver that the four men, who had left the telephone in the taxi, wanted to go to a border town in Cambodia. He was last heard from on 6 November <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> his wife to tell her that he was safe but was unwilling to reveal his whereabouts. Gui's family contacted the Swedish embassy, and the Swedish police filed a report through Interpol, but the Guardian, noting that the military junta was becoming increasingly accommodating to Chinese demands, observed that the Thais had done little to advance the case. The Thai authorities have no record of him leaving the country.|$|E
