500|$|Film {{scholars}} and historians view Citizen Kane as Welles's {{attempt to create}} a new style of filmmaking by studying various forms of film making, and combining them all into one. However, Welles stated that his love for cinema began only when he started the work on the film. When asked where he got the confidence as a first-time director to direct a film so radically different from contemporary cinema, he responded, [...] "Ignorance, ignorance, sheer ignorance—you know there's no confidence to equal it. It's only <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> something about a profession, I think, that you're timid or careful." ...|$|E

She took an interest in mitigating the emotional effects of the attacks on children, particularly the disturbing images repeatedly replayed on television. On the one-year anniversary, she encouraged parents to instead read to their children, and perhaps light a candle in memoriam, saying, [...] "Don't let your children see the images, especially on September 11, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it'll probably be on television again and again – the plane hitting the building or the buildings falling." ...|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times {{rated the}} episode the 79th of all Lost episodes (apart from the series finale), {{described}} the episode as [...] "thrilling," [...] but opined {{that the show}} since [...] "has done similar things much better." [...] Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly did not care for Jack's flashbacks, but commended the scene in which Jack saved Charlie, stating [...] "even though I {{knew he was going}} to go back to the CPR and save Charlie's life, I started crying. This is how you identify good TV: <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what's going to happen and you still get swept up in it all." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{narrative}} of the School Rumble anime is designed to mirror that of the manga, which results in multiple short story segments with no significant connection. Shown {{from the perspective of}} its characters—notably Tenma and Harima as they attempt similar ploys to get their crush to notice their affection—the anime uses absurdist humor which often combines elements of popular culture to explore the love-triangle, with jokes that work on multiple levels. One such example, highlighted by Lisa Marie, reviewer for Anime Today, is the bike chase scene in episode1 of season one. She notes that while anyone can appreciate the chase's inherent humor, those familiar with Initial D will find another level of appreciation that nevertheless does not interfere with viewers who do not catch the deeper reference. Lisa Marie comments [...] "I certainly admit watching an insane bike chase cross paths with Initial Ds famous AE86 has a bit more [...] <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> why there's a cheesily rendered race car in slow moving Eurobeat." ...|$|E
500|$|Since Dexter {{producers}} try {{to shield}} the child actors {{as much as possible}} from the show's dark subject matter, executive producer Daniel Cerone urged the mother of his son's friend not to let her son audition to play a young Dexter, who is filmed sitting in a pool of blood. Erik King found the shot of the boy crying in the blood to be the creepiest moment of the first season. He described it as [...] "very uncomfortable to watch, even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it's not real and you know these kids are actors." [...] Cinematographer Romeo Tirone tightened the camera's shutter angle when filming these scenes to make them [...] "feel like fragments of memory - subjective, with tight close-ups against an indistinct background. You don't see all the details of the environment." [...] Series director Keith Gordon found these flashbacks [...] "incredible" [...] because he thought they were [...] "like a Stanley Kubrick movie".|$|E
500|$|... "Walk Away" [...] is a piano-driven waltz ballad. Written {{in the key}} of G major, it is a downtempo song, with a {{moderate}} slow and bluesy tempo of 52 beats per minute. It {{is followed by a}} chord progression of EmC7 in the verses. Aguilera's vocal range on the song span nearly two octaves, from the low-note of C3 to the high-note of G5. In the track, Aguilera uses a [...] "sultry lower range". Lyrically, [...] "Walk Away" [...] is about an abusive relationship, where she uses a [...] "clever" [...] metaphor. At the song's beginning, the lyrics [...] "What do you do, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> something's bad for you, and you still can't let go?" [...] are spoken by Aguilera. In the first verse, she sings, [...] "Your love was like candy/ Artificially sweet, I was deceived by your wrapping". The track was described as a non-sense song by Amanda Murray for Sputnikmusic.|$|E

500|$|Christian Louboutin {{said that}} he would {{dedicate}} his time to creating some [...] "scene-stealing designs for the single's video", out of his appreciation for the song. According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about that woman, you know when you have that moment when you realize you have to really get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video. Even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that it's gonna hurt later, you feel good about making the decision, so you're like [...] "I decided! I'm walking up out the house right now" [...] and that's the part we're gonna do in the video except I'm gonna dance my way out the house." ...|$|E
500|$|Jayma Mays commented {{of their}} relationship: [...] "Oh no! I don’t know if I can say! That’s a hard {{question}} {{because when you}} see the scenes of Emma and Will, you obviously think 'Oh of course they’re supposed to be together, of course, of course!' but the fact is, is that he’s a married man and Emma knows that’s wrong, and she doesn’t want to be a homewrecker. She doesn’t want to ruin a relationship. So I guess in a perfect world, she could find someone like Will, or maybe Ken Tanaka (laughs) can become a little bit more like Will. But maybe it’s all about respect. Maybe if she can respect Ken enough, that will develop into true love." [...] She also commented of her co-star Matthew Morrison (Will): [...] "We were friends. We knew each other before we started this job. We worked together once before. So, that’s always helpful <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> the person that you’re working with, and you already feel comfortable around them. But yeah, he’s a really good friend, so that makes that stuff a little bit easier." ...|$|E
500|$|Paltrow's final {{appearance}} in the [...] "A Night of Neglect" [...] episode was met with divergent reactions. Both MTV journalist Aly Semigran and Gonzalez approved of Holly's departure, the latter of whom stating that Glee writers gave the character an appropriate ending and rounded out her arc. In contrast, CNN writer Lisa Respers France was dismayed by the character's exit and favored Holly's [...] "memorable" [...] characterization in the episode. The Washington Post Lisa de Moraes expressed interest in a season three return, and Canning described Holly as [...] "charming as ever" [...] in the episode. Myles McNutt, writing for The A.V. Club, felt the installment [...] "captured the occasional awkwardness of Paltrow's presence on the show", and wrote that casting such a prominent actress [...] "has its disadvantages <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that she's only around on a temporary basis". TVLine correspondent Michael Slezak noted that Will and Emma's romance—and that Paltrow probably {{was not ready to}} commit to the series full-time—led to Holly's adieu. Slezak concluded that what he liked about Holly, was that she did not succumb to Will, which, according to Slezak, made him less annoying.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{considered}} [...] "Subtle Invitation" [...] {{to be one}} of the album's strongest songs {{because of}} its [...] "well executed" [...] jazz influence. The song begins with the sounds of people dining, then introduces the strong bassline and drums. Towards the end of the song, Carey belts out the climax. Sarah Rodman from The Boston Herald described it as fascinating and wrote, [...] "it sounds as though Carey is singing in falsetto while still in her chest voice." [...] "Clown" [...] drew strong media attention, and its lyrical content led critics to speculate that Carey aimed it at rapper Eminem, who had publicly announced that he had had a relationship with Carey. Rodman said [...] "Clown" [...] was [...] "languidly sinister", with lyrics such as, [...] "I should've left it at 'I like your music too'...You should never have intimated we were lovers / <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> very well we never even touched each other." [...] Critics compared [...] "I Only Wanted" [...] with [...] "My All"s instrumentation and structure of verse, chorus and guitar solo. According to Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine, Carey makes vague allusions to her ex-husband Tommy Mottola with the line, [...] "Wish I'd stayed beneath my veil". The song uses Latin-inspired guitar instrumentation and wind sounds as an additional backbone to the melody, and dripping water as its percussion.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Eminem {{mentioned}} the singer twice on The Eminem Show, his fourth studio album, {{on the tracks}} [...] "Superman" [...] and [...] "When the Music Stops", {{both of which were}} revealed to have been inspired by their relationship in Eminem's 2008 autobiography, The Way I Am. The former track contained the lyrics [...] "What you trying be? My new wife? / What, you Mariah? Fly through twice," [...] while the latter suggested that he begged to be taken back by Carey. Later that year, Eminem confirmed that they had been in a relationship in an interview for Rolling Stone, but claimed to have not been fully committed to it and that he disliked her as a person, while Carey told Maxim that it was never a [...] "sexual relationship" [...] and interviewer Larry King [...] "I hung out with him, I spoke to him on the phone. I think I was probably with him a total of four times. And I don't consider that dating somebody." [...] Carey recorded a song called [...] "Clown" [...] for Charmbracelet which [...] "ambiguously addressed the relationship" [...] with the lyrics [...] "Should've left it at I like your music too" [...] and [...] "You should've never intimated we were lovers/ <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> very well we never even touched each other." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Deep Throat {{has been well}} received by critics and fans. Entertainment Weekly described Hardin's performance as [...] "world-weary and heavyhearted", and listed his appearance in the character's eponymous début episode as the 37th greatest television moment of the 1990s. However, they felt at times that his presence in episodes such as [...] "Ghost in the Machine" [...] seemed [...] "gratuitous". Reviewing the character's début episode, the San Jose Mercury News called Deep Throat [...] "the most interesting new character on television". Chris Carter has stated that Hardin's performance gave the series an element of [...] "believability" [...] that it needed; and felt that the episode [...] "E.B.E." [...] was {{a great opportunity to}} expand the character's role. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen called Deep Throat's death [...] "a shocking moment, even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it's coming", praising the [...] "desperation" [...] evident in Hardin's performance, although lamenting the [...] "curse of continuity" [...] that led to the character being quickly replaced with Steven Williams' X. Ben Rawson-Jones, writing for Digital Spy, felt that Deep Throat's tenure on The X-Files was [...] "arguably the show's peak", and praised Hardin's acting in the role. Brian Lowry, in his book The Truth Is Out There, has noted that the character [...] "helped establish a tone and undercurrent of gravity on The X-Files that was to provide the spine of the series".|$|E

500|$|Overall, Breakout is {{dominant}} on pop rock but explores {{a variety}} of other musical genres. The opening track, [...] "Breakout", is a dance-pop number that begins with a fast beat, composed of chiming electric guitar and drums and later progresses to [...] "the snares skip and the keyboards shimmer"; [...] "ecstatic beats" [...] pummel throughout. The song's lyrics are [...] "a girls-only call to fun" [...] that anecdote on feelings about coming of age and the desire to be school-free. The uptempo refrains of [...] "7 Things" [...] are pop punk influenced. The song is [...] "a three-tempo patchwork quilt", transitioning [...] "from sensitive breakup song in the strummy verses to punky-pop kiss-off in the double-time choruses." [...] "7 Things"' lyrics list seven traits Cyrus hates about an ex-boyfriend. [...] "The Driveway" [...] is a power ballad whose lyrics regard a breakup, insisting [...] "nothing hurts like losing <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it's really gone." [...] The cover of Cyndi Lauper's [...] "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" [...] replaces the subtle reggae undercurrent in the original version with a more rock music driven sound that includes pop punk beats and string stabs. The lyrics of [...] "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" [...] primarily discuss the [...] "desire to let loose with one's friends", touching upon details of the life of an overworked child star. The song [...] "Full Circle" [...] is composed of a several pop rock hooks; in one of the hooks, Cyrus finishes various words with [...] "Oh, oh, oh!". The lyrics describe not quitting a relationship.|$|E
500|$|An {{ensemble}} of 20 actors {{make up the}} bulk of the series' cast. Hawley found ensembles enticing because they presented [...] "a lot of really good moving pieces". At Paleyfest 2015, the Fargo creator commented: [...] "It's sort of like a horse race in a way, especially <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that everyone is on this collision course. It's like, 'Who's going to make it?' And you can put people together in unexpected pairings." [...] Offerman played Karl Weathers, an alcoholic and the only lawyer in Luverne, and Cristin Milioti was assigned the part of Betsy Solverson, Lou's terminally ill wife. Hawley felt that Milioti was the right choice because her personality was similar to her character's. Garrett portrays Joe Bulo, and Bokeem Woodbine appears as Mike Milligan, a role he was offered two days after auditioning. For the role of Hanzee Dent, Hawley hired Zahn McClarnon two weeks after his audition. Six others play members of the Gerhardts: Kieran Culkin as Rye, Rachel Keller as Simone, Michael Hogan as Otto, Allan Dobescu as Charlie, Angus Sampson as Bear, and Jeffrey Donovan as Dodd. When asked about his decision to cast Donovan, Hawley told the actor, [...] "I don't know. You just come off with a sense of power. I think Dodd comes off with a sense of power, and I thought that you have the chops to find the humor in it." [...] Donovan gained 30 pounds in preparation for his role. Other major supporting roles in Fargo second season include: Bruce Campbell as Ronald Reagan, Keir O'Donnell as Ben Schmidt, and Elizabeth Marvel as Constance Heck.|$|E
500|$|From {{the year}} 2001 onwards, Eminem {{claimed to have}} dated Carey for six months {{throughout}} the gloomy times in her life. Carey denied ever having {{been involved with the}} rapper in a personal relationship, claiming that they had only met a handful of times, and it was professional. Subsequently, he referred to Carey in several of his songs in a negative light, claiming to have been angered by her not admitting to seeing him. On Charmbracelet, Carey included a song titled [...] "Clown", which critics suggested was aimed at Eminem. [...] "Clown"'s lyrics were described as [...] "languidly sinister" [...] by Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe, and read: [...] "I should've left it at 'I like your music too'...You should never have intimated we were lovers / <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> very well we never even touched each other." [...] In 2005, during concerts on the rapper's Anger Management Tour, he began playing voice-mails and recordings that were reportedly left by Carey. One of the messages said: [...] "I heard you were getting back with your ex-wife. Why won't you see me? Why won't you call me?". After playing the excerpt, Eminem would pretend to be sick before launching into his song [...] "Puke". On May 12, 2009, Eminem released his sixth studio album Relapse, which included the song [...] "Bagpipes from Baghdad". The song's lyrics suggested Eminem was still in love with Carey and [...] "wanted her back": [...] "I want another crack at ya" [...] and [...] "Nick Cannon better back the f**k up. I'm not playing, I want her back, you punk." [...] After the song's release, Cannon went on his website, defending Carey and expressing his disgust at the rapper's comments: ...|$|E

500|$|In another Rolling Stone interview, {{the band}} {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} the title track, saying that is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged. Bassist Peter Mosely, in discussion of this, said: [...] "We're older than people think we are. [...] We go through months of serenity, and then there'll be this one night where there will be evil." [...] In another interview discussion about [...] "Lights and Sounds", Key noted that it is [...] "about a band like us coming into a career that we didn't think we'd have. You find yourself surrounded by a lot of false people, {{a lot of people who}} are not doing it for the same reasons you are. That song is about the struggle of not giving in to that." [...] The band explained that the lyrics, [...] "Make it new but stay in the lines / Just let go but keep it inside / Smile big for everyone / Even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> what they've done / They gave you the end but not where to start / Not how to build, how to tear it apart", were written because of that particular reason. Key also revealed that the lyrics, [...] "They gave you the end / But not where to start / Not how to build / But how to tear it apart", were references to bands Nofx and Bad Religion. Key also explained that when he was preoccupied by distractions, in which he referred to them as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album and track title just that. Key also revealed that it was because that is how it surrounded the band, when working on the album.|$|E
500|$|On March 25, 1983, Jackson {{reunited with}} his {{brothers}} for a performance taped at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium for , an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16, 1983, to an estimated audience of , and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars. It is best remembered for Jackson's solo performance of [...] "Billie Jean", which earned Jackson his first Emmy nomination. Wearing a distinctive black-sequined jacket and a golf glove decorated with rhinestones, he debuted his signature dance move, the moonwalk, which former Soul Train dancer and Shalamar member Jeffrey Daniel had taught him three years earlier. Jackson had originally turned down the invitation to perform at the show, believing {{he had been doing}} too much television at the time; at the request of Motown founder Berry Gordy, he agreed to perform in exchange for time to do a solo performance. According to Rolling Stone reporter Mikal Gilmore, [...] "There are times <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> you are hearing or seeing something extraordinary ... that came that night." [...] Jackson's performance drew comparisons to Elvis Presley's and the Beatles' appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times wrote in 1988: [...] "The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style. How does he do it? As a technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing." [...] Gordy said of the performance: [...] "From the first beat of 'Billie Jean', I was mesmerized, and when he did his iconic moonwalk, I was shocked, it was magic, Michael Jackson went into orbit, and never came down." ...|$|E
