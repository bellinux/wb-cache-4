This study reveals that the response of the HDR- 1000 Plus well-type chamber was well within &# 177; 0. 5 &#x 0025; for about three years after calibration/recalibration.

40|$|Background and purpose: Historically HDR {{brachytherapy}} treatment {{planning systems}} ignore the transit dose in the computation of patient dose. However, the total radiation dose delivered during each treatment cycle {{is equal to}} the sum of the static dose and the transit dose and every HDR application therefore results in two radiation doses. Consequently, the absorbed dose to the target volume is more than the prescribed dose as computed during treatment planning. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the magnitude of the transit dose component of two 192 Ir HDR brachytherapy units and assess its dosimetric significance. Materials and Methods: <b>Ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> dosimetry systems (<b>well-type</b> and Farmertype <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers)</b> were used to measure the charge generated during the transit of the 192 Ir source from a GammaMed and a Nucletron MicroSelectron HDR afterloader using single catheters of lengths 120 cm. Different source configurations were used for the measurements of integrated charge. Two analysis techniques were used for transit time determination: the multiple exposure technique and the graphical solution of zero exposure. The transit time was measured for the total transit of the radioactive source into (entry) and out of (exit) the catheters. Results: A maximum source transit time of 1. 7 s was measured. The transit dose depends on the source activity, source configuration, number of treatment fractions, prescription dose and the type of remote afterloader used. It does not depend on the measurement technique, measurement distance or the analysis technique used for transit time determination. Conclusion: A finite transit time increases the radiation dose beyond that due to the programmed source dwell time alone. The significance of the transit dose would increase with a decrease in source dwell time or a higher activity source...|$|R

Thirteen of the <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> had a Farmer-type geometry but consisted of different combinations of wall and central electrode materials.

40|$|AbstractAimTo {{calibrate}} Ir- 192 {{high dose}} rate (HDR) brachytherapy source using different calibration methods {{and to determine}} the accuracy and suitability of each method for routine calibrations. BackgroundThe source calibration {{is an essential part}} of the quality assurance programme for dosimetry of brachytherapy sources. The clinical use of brachytherapy source requires an independent measurement of the air kerma strength according to the recommendations of medical physics societies. Materials and methodsThe Ir- 192 HDR brachytherapy source from Gammamed plus machine (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) was calibrated using three different procedures, one using the <b>well-type</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber,</b> second by the in-air calibration method and third using solid water phantoms. The reference air kerma rate (RAKR) of the source was determined using Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Medizinische Physik (DGMP) recommendations. ResultsThe RAKR determined using different calibration methods are in good agreement with the manufacturer stated value. The mean percentage variations of 0. 21, − 0. 94, − 0. 62 and 0. 58 in RAKR values with respect to the manufacturer quoted values were observed with the well-type chamber, in-air calibration, cylindrical phantom and slab phantom measurements, respectively. ConclusionMeasurements with a well-type chamber are relatively simple to perform. For in-air measurements, the indigenously designed calibration jig provides an accurate positioning of the source and chamber with minimum scatter contribution. The slab phantom system has an advantage that no additional phantom and chamber are required other than those used for external beam therapy dosimetry.

40|$|Automated seed loaders for {{permanent}} prostate implants are now commercially available. Besides improved radiation safety, these systems offer seed assay capa-bility {{and ease of}} needle loading, making preplanned as well as intra-operative implant procedures more time-efficient. The Isoloader (Mentor Corp., CA) uses individual I 125 seeds (SL- 125 ProstaSeed) loaded in up to 199 chambers inside a shielded cartridge. The unit performs seed counting and calibration using a built-in solid-state detector. In order to evaluate the reproducibility and accuracy of the calibration process, two test cartridges were measured with the Isoloader itself and compared with a <b>well-type</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> (HDR- 1000 Plus, Standard Imag-ing). The air kerma strength measurements for all seeds using the Isoloader had {{a standard deviation of}} about 2. 7 %. For the eight seeds assayed more intensively using both the Isoloader and well chamber, the standard deviations of the measure-ments for each seed were in the range of 0. 8 % to 2. 8 % and 0. 6 % to 1. 3 %, respectively. The variation in the Isoloader calibration is attributed to small detec-tor solid angle and bead geometry within seed capsules (verified by radiographs). The reproducibility of the air kerma strength measured by the Isoloader was com-parable to that from the well chamber and was clinically acceptable. Seed strength measured with the Isoloader was on average 1 % ~ 2 % larger than that measured with the well chamber, indicating that the accuracy of the Isoloader was clinically acceptable.
