40|$|The {{majority}} {{of previous studies}} on <b>cognate</b> <b>words</b> have found a robust cognate facilitation effect in picture naming using alphabetic languages. Research has also identified that if the cognates do not share phonology or meaning (i. e., false cognate inhibition effect), this effect may become inhibitory. These mixed findings {{seem to suggest that}} semantics, phonology and orthography may contribute differently to <b>cognate</b> <b>word</b> <b>processing.</b> In this thesis, two effects, the phonological overlap effect and the orthographical overlap effect were examined independently for the first time by testing picture naming in two non-alphabetic languages: Cantonese and Mandarin. Two types of <b>cognate</b> <b>words</b> were included: <b>cognate</b> and semi-cognate <b>words.</b> The orthography of both <b>cognate</b> and semi-cognate <b>words</b> is shared between L 1 and L 2, but only <b>cognate</b> <b>words</b> share phonology. The thesis study included three experiments. In the preparatory experiment, an on-line rating study was conducted, whereby <b>cognate</b> and semi-cognate <b>words</b> with mono-syllabic or bi-syllabic names in Mandarin and Cantonese were rated on word AOA, frequency, picture complexity, familiarity and image agreement. From the preparatory experiments a pictorial-word corpus was selected to use in Experiments 1 and 2. In Experiment 1, Cantonese-Mandarin bilinguals named pictures in the corpus in L 1 (Cantonese). By contrasting <b>cognate</b> and semi-cognate <b>word</b> naming latency, the results showed a slowed naming latency for <b>cognate</b> <b>words</b> that was marginally significant. It is argued that this finding reflects a possible inhibitory effect from the difference in stages at which competition occurs and the difference in the cognitive load of that competition for <b>cognate</b> and semi-cognate <b>words.</b> In Experiment 2, Cantonese-Mandarin bilinguals named the same pictures in L 2 (Mandarin), showing a similar trend of cognate inhibition effect as that found in Experiment 1, albeit with a smaller magnitude of cognate inhibition. Taken together, the cognate inhibition effect {{can be explained by the}} different stages of cross-language competition that occur for <b>cognate</b> and semi-cognate <b>words</b> in picture naming. The cognitive load of overcoming that competition is larger for cognate than for semi-cognate words. published_or_final_versionSpeech and Hearing SciencesMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

5000|$|In linguistics, <b>cognates</b> are <b>words</b> {{that have}} a common etymological origin. In etymology, the cognate {{category}} excludes doublets and loanwords. The <b>word</b> <b>cognate</b> derives from the Latin noun cognatus, which means [...] "blood relative".|$|R
50|$|Given that Switzerland is quadrilingual, {{they needed}} a language-neutral name for their organisation. They invented the term chronometrophilia from the Greek chronos (time) and philia ("the love of"); and meter, a Teutonic <b>word</b> <b>cognate</b> to the Latin modius (bushel).|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of phonological and orthographic overlap in the recognition of <b>cognate</b> <b>words</b> by recording electrophysiological and behavioral data. One hundred and ninety-two words were selected: 96 <b>cognate</b> <b>words</b> listed according to their phonological and orthographic overlap vs. 96 noncognate words. Twenty-four proficient European Portuguese-English bilinguals performed a silent reading task with a masked priming paradigm. The results showed that phonology interacts with semantic activation at N 400 modulations. Phonological priming effects were dependent on the orthographic overlap of <b>cognate</b> <b>words.</b> Thus, the distinctive <b>processing</b> of <b>cognate</b> <b>words</b> seems {{to be due to}} their cross-linguistic similarity, which is consistent with a localist connectionist account on <b>cognate</b> representation and <b>processing.</b> Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) -European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) - PTDC/PSI-PCO/ 104671 / 2008 European Union - Operational Agenda for Competitiveness Factors (COMPETE) National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) Spanish Ministry of Education and Science - PSI 2009 – 12616, Plan...|$|R
