5|$|Hergé {{requested}} that Jean Dupont, {{the editor of}} L'Écho illustré– the magazine in which The Adventures of Tintin was serialised in Switzerland– send him documentation on Swiss railways <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> draw from. He also {{requested that}} his Swiss friend Charly Fornora send him a bottle of Valais wine <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> again use as a model from which to draw. Hergé subsequently travelled to Switzerland himself to produce accurate sketches of scenes around Geneva <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> then incorporate into the story; these included at Geneva Cointrin International Airport, Genève-Cornavin railway station, and the Cornavin Hotel, {{as well as the}} road through Cervens and Topolino's house in Nyon. Despite this realism, a number of minor errors were made in Hergé's depiction of Geneva.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work {{on other}} {{projects}} to concentrate on a diploma piece, without <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not become a Royal Academician.

5|$|The {{conference at}} Calais was {{something}} of a political triumph, but even though the French government gave implicit support for Henry's remarriage and Francis I himself held private conference with Anne, the French King maintained alliances with the Pope <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not explicitly defy.|$|E

5|$|After the French {{capitulation}} at Kehl (10 January 1797), Fürstenberg received additional {{forces with}} <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> end the siege at Hüningen. He ordered the reinforcement {{of the ring}} of soldiers surrounding Hüningen and, on 2 February 1797, the Austrians prepared to storm the bridgehead. General of Division Georges Joseph Dufour, the new French commander, pre-empted {{what would have been}} a costly attack, by offering to surrender the bridge. On 5 February, Fürstenberg finally took possession of the bridgehead. Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, appointed him as Colonel and Proprietor of the 36th Infantry Regiment, which bore his name until his death in battle in 1799.|$|E

He had to take them to {{pastures}} in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect that his life was going to change forever and that his father {{was not going to be}} able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E
5|$|Habes al-Majali {{is quoted}} as the only Arab {{commander}} to have defeated the Israelis in 1948 and who restored a little honour to the Arabs.

After the war, he was appointed bodyguard of Abdallah and in 1957 Chief-of-Staff of the Jordanian Army. He became Jordanian Minister of Defence in 1967.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} under regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, the fact that goods had not been exported from Singapore was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require {{the owner of the}} goods to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had to decide whether the customs officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely whether there was some evidence on <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> reasonably have reached his decision. However, the Court did not pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|E
5|$|Montcalm in {{particular}} would {{have benefited from}} practicing a more irregular form of warfare. He apparently never inspected the landing area {{at the north end}} of Lake George, which was a location from <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> contest the British landing. Furthermore, the French could then have used the confined woodlands to blunt the numerical advantage of the British, and contested the entire portage road. The fact that fortifications were built along the portage road but then abandoned by the French is one indication of this failure of strategic thinking. Nester estimates that contesting the first crossing on the portage road would have gained Montcalm an additional day for defensive preparations.|$|E
5|$|A minimum term {{of service}} of 25 years was established, {{at the end}} of which the {{retiring}} auxiliary soldier, and all his children, were awarded Roman citizenship. This is deduced from the fact that the first known Roman military diplomas date from the time of Claudius. This was a folding bronze tablet engraved with the details of the soldier's service record, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> use to prove his citizenship. Claudius also decreed that prefects of auxiliary regiments must all be of equestrian rank, thus excluding centurions from such commands. The fact that auxiliary commanders were now all of the same social rank as most tribuni militum, (military tribunes, a legion's senior staff officers, all of whom only one, the tribunus laticlavius, was of the higher senatorial rank), probably indicates that auxilia now enjoyed greater prestige. Indigenous chiefs continued to command some auxiliary regiments, and were probably granted equestrian rank for the purpose. It is also likely that auxiliary pay was standardised at this time, but we only have estimates for the Julio-Claudian period.|$|E

5|$|After Groenlo was secured, Mondragón marched {{south to}} Rheinberg {{to cover the}} town from a Dutch attack. He encamped his army near Wesel, at Dinslaken, while Maurice {{followed}} him and took up positions at Bislich, both armies being separated by the Lippe river. The Spanish position was strong; the rearguard and the left flank covered by the Rhine and the right flank by the Lippe {{and a range of}} moorland hills called Testerburg. For several weeks both armies looked at each other, often skirmishing when both cavalries sallied to forage. As time passed, the Spanish foragers were forced to look for victuals two or three leagues far away from their camp. Maurice took the opportunity to plan a mock ambush on Mondragón's foraging convoy aiming to lure him into a general action in <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> destroy the Spanish army. Mondragón also hoped to lure his enemy into a trap.|$|E
5|$|During 1930, Allen again had {{leave in}} <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> play cricket, and {{was among the}} front-runners for {{a place in the}} England team. His first {{appearance}} of the season was for the MCC against the Australian touring team. Although he took four for 28 on the last day, his rivals for an England place were also successful. Playing for Middlesex against the Australians, Allen took six for 77 but was overlooked for the first Test at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. England won the match during the course of which Larwood, the incumbent fast bowler in the team, fell ill. Allen opted to play for Middlesex against Northamptonshire while the team for the second Test was being chosen, and took six for 77. His subsequent inclusion in the squad of 13 for that game was not particularly well received by the press.|$|E
5|$|Elphinstone rapidly took {{advantage}} of the confusion Harriers attack had created, passing Aalbers' bow and raking his ship. Elphinstone then threw his sails back, halting his ship and allowing Greyhound to maintain a position across Pallas bow from <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> inflict severe damage on the Dutch frigate without coming under fire himself. As the damage and casualties mounted on Pallas, Harrier joined the attack. Gunfire from the Dutch ship gradually slackened, and finally stopped at 06:10, the Dutch flag was struck from the mast and Pallas surrendered with over 40 casualties from a crew of 250 (including 50 local recruits). Throughout the engagement, Victoria and Batavier had kept up a constant but inefficient fire on Harrier, Troubridge waiting until the Dutch flagship surrendered before counterattacking.|$|E
50|$|Berzsenyi {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{contradictory}} poets of Hungarian literature. He lived the life of a farmer, and wished to be close to the events of Hungarian literature. This contradiction, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> believed <b>he</b> <b>could</b> solve, made him a lonesome, introverted and bitter poet. His works show signs of classicism, sentimentalism and romanticism.|$|R

5|$|In 1904, Krueger {{attended}} {{and graduated}} from the Infantry-Cavalry School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. This {{was followed by the}} Command and General Staff College in 1907. He then joined the 23rd Infantry at Fort Ontario, New York. After a second tour in the Philippines, he returned to the United States in June 1909, and was assigned to Department of Languages at Fort Leavenworth as an instructor in Spanish, French and German, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> speak fluently. He also taught National Guard officers at Camp Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, and Pine Camp, New York. He published translations of several German military texts, most notably William Balck's Tactics. The book attracted the attention of the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, Major General Leonard Wood, and was widely read.|$|E
5|$|In the empire, Frederick {{faced the}} {{opposition}} of the Bavarian Wittelsbach dynasty and of his cousin Sigismund, who was duke in Tyrol, Vorarlberg, and Further Austria then. Sigismund had been {{in conflict with the}} Swiss Confederacy, too. When he had been banned by Pope Pius II in a conflict over the nomination of a bishop in Tyrol, the Swiss had annexed the formerly Habsburg territories of the Thurgau. In 1468, Sigismund clashed with the Swiss in the War of Waldshut, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> end without significant territorial losses only by paying a large ransom, which he financed by pawning territories in the Sundgau and the Alsace to Charles the Bold of Burgundy in 1469. Charles did not, however, help Sigismund against the Swiss, and so Sigismund bought back the territories in 1474 and concluded a peace treaty with the Confederacy, the Ewige Richtung, although the emperor never recognized it. In the following Burgundy Wars, the Swiss and Sigismund both fought against Charles the Bold.|$|E
5|$|It {{conveyed}} a {{tenth of}} the royal demesne– the lands of the crown as opposed to the personal property of the sovereign– into the hands of churches, ecclesiastics and laymen. In Anglo-Saxon England property was either folkland or bookland. The transmission of folkland was governed by the customary rights of kinsmen, subject to the king's approval, whereas bookland was established by the grant of a royal charter, and could be disposed of freely by the owner. Booking land thus converted it by charter from folkland to bookland. The royal demesne was the crown's folkland, whereas the king's bookland was his own personal property <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> leave by will as he chose. In the decimation Æthelwulf may have conveyed royal folkland by charter to become bookland, in some cases to laymen who already leased the land.|$|E
