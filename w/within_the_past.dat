5|$|Mount St. Helens is geologically young {{compared}} with the other major Cascade volcanoes. It formed only <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 40,000 years, and the pre-1980 summit cone began rising about 2,200 years ago. The volcano is considered the most active in the Cascades within the Holocene epoch (the last 10,000 or so years).|$|E

5|$|Improving {{opportunities}} for growing families of same-sex couples has shaped {{the political landscape}} <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> ten years. A push for same-sex marriage or civil unions in western countries has replaced other political objectives. , ten countries and six U.S. states offer same-sex marriage; civil unions are offered as an option in some European countries, U.S. states and individual municipalities. The ability to adopt domestically or internationally children or provide a home as a foster parent is also a political and family priority for many lesbians, as is improving access to artificial insemination.|$|E

A survey of same-sex couples in the United States showed that between 2000 and 2005, the number of people claiming to be in same-sex relationships increased by 30%—five times the rate of population growth in the U.S. The study attributed the jump to people being more comfortable self-identifying as homosexual to the federal government.|$|E

5|$|Three {{species of}} Malagasy {{hippopotamus}} became extinct during the Holocene on Madagascar, {{one of them}} <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 1,000 years. The Malagasy hippos were smaller than the modern hippopotamus, likely {{through the process of}} insular dwarfism. Fossil evidence indicates many Malagasy hippos were hunted by humans, a likely factor in their eventual extinction. Isolated members of Malagasy hippopotamus may have survived in remote pockets; in 1976, villagers described a living animal called the kilopilopitsofy, which may have been a Malagasy hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|When steamboats were {{superseded}} by the railroad, the river {{lost much of}} its significance to the state. The influx of immigrants to Florida settled primarily south of Orlando, adversely affecting the natural order of wetlands there. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 50 years, however, urban areas in the northern and central parts of the state have grown considerably. In the upper basin, population increased by 700 percent between 1950 and 2000, and is expected to rise another 1.5 million by 2020.|$|E
5000|$|... "September 1913" [...] is {{a poem by}} W. B. Yeats.

5|$|Cancer {{screening}} uses {{medical tests}} to detect disease in {{large groups of}} people who have no symptoms. For individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options to respond to {{it in a way that}} prolongs life. This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%).

5|$|Eliot {{began writing}} The Dry Salvages {{at the end}} of 1940 during air-raids on London, and managed to finish the poem quickly. The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, there is a connection to all of mankind within each man. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{it will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> in order to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation.|$|E
50|$|The {{key to the}} PTAAGMB {{model is}} the glacier’s area-altitude distribution, which is simply the glacier’s surface area as a {{function}} of elevation. The AA profile is a unique feature of a glacier that has been shaped by thousands of years of erosion of the bedrock underlying the glacier. Thus, the area altitude distribution has embedded <b>within</b> it <b>the</b> <b>past</b> climate history that has formed the glacier.|$|R

5|$|It {{is likely}} that Native Americans living along the Columbia River as early as 10,000years ago visited the Bull Run {{watershed}} in search of food. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> few thousand years they created trails over the Cascade Range and around Mount Hood, near {{the upper part of}} the Bull Run watershed. By the mid-19th century, pioneers used these trails to cross the mountains from east to west to reach the fertile Willamette Valley. In the 1890s, the City of Portland, searching for sources of clean drinking water, chose the Bull Run River. Dam-building, road construction, and legal action to protect the watershed began shortly thereafter, and Bull Run water began to flow through a large pipe to the city in 1895.|$|E
5|$|People {{have lived}} in the Everglades region for {{thousands}} of years. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 100years however, they have changed the natural landscape dramatically. Settlement of urban areas in South Florida was facilitated by large drainage projects intended to create more land. The drainage was often implemented without a full understanding of the intricacies of ecosystems and shaping processes of the Everglades. The South Florida metropolitan area grew exponentially, causing problems in ecosystems throughout the Everglades. By the 1990s, the diminishing quality of life in many of these urban areas was linked to the degraded local environment. The State of Florida and the U.S. government devised and passed a plan in 2000 to restore as much of the Everglades to pre-drainage conditions as possible. It is the costliest and most comprehensive environmental restoration project in history.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{is home to}} many {{cultures}} and {{a wide variety of}} ethnic groups, traditions, and values. Aside from the Native American, Native Hawaiian, and Native Alaskan populations, nearly all Americans or their ancestors settled or immigrated <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> five centuries. Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa. More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as both a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl in which immigrants and their descendants retain distinctive cultural characteristics.|$|E

50|$|Phosphate {{is used in}} fertilisers. Immense {{quantities}} of phosphate rock or phosphorite occur in sedimentary shelf deposits, {{ranging in age from}} the Proterozoic to currently forming environments.

Similar to iron ore deposits and oil, particular conditions in the ocean and environment are thought to have contributed to these deposits <b>within</b> <b>the</b> geological <b>past.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{last three}} eruptions at Mount Hood {{occurred}} <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 1,800 years from vents {{high on the}} southwest flank and produced deposits that were distributed primarily {{to the south and}} west along the Sandy and Zigzag rivers. The last eruptive period took place around 220 to 170 years ago, when dacitic lava domes, pyroclastic flows and mudflows were produced without major explosive eruptions. The prominent Crater Rock just below the summit is hypothesized to be the remains of one of these now-eroded domes. This period includes the last major eruption of 1781 to 1782 with a slightly more recent episode ending shortly before the arrival of the explorers Lewis and Clark in 1805. The latest minor eruptive event occurred in August 1907.|$|E
