5|$|A motte-and-bailey castle is a {{fortification}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> or stone keep {{situated on}} a raised earthwork called a motte, {{accompanied by an}} enclosed courtyard, or bailey, surrounded by a protective ditch and palisade. Relatively easy to build with unskilled, often forced, labour, but still militarily formidable, these castles were built across northern Europe from the 10th century onwards, spreading from Normandy and Anjou in France, into the Holy Roman Empire in the 11th century. The Normans introduced the design into England and Wales following their invasion in 1066. Motte-and-bailey castles were adopted in Scotland, Ireland, the Low Countries and Denmark in the 12th and 13th centuries. By {{the end of the}} 13th century, the design was largely superseded by alternative forms of fortification, but the earthworks remain a prominent feature in many countries.|$|E
5|$|According to Abdul Baqir Zein, {{the mosque}} was first built in 1700 {{at the foot}} of Mount Padang, then moved to the bank of Batang Arau, as the Dutch colonial {{government}} intended to use the previous location to build a road to Emma Haven Port. It was later moved to its present location. However, the Indonesian Department of Religion documents the mosque as having been constructed in 1790 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> frame and a roof made from Sago palms. According to this documentation, a sturdier mosque was built in 1805. Another history of the mosque, from the Culture and Tourism Department of the City of the Padang, suggests that the mosque was first constructed in 1805. The small mosque had stone flooring, wood and dirt walls, and a pyramidal ceiling like the mosques in Java.|$|E

5|$|Hammond console organs come <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wooden</b> pedalboard {{played with}} the feet, for bass notes. Most console Hammond pedalboards have 25 notes, with the bottom note a low C and the top note a middle C two octaves higher. Hammond used a 25-note pedalboard because he found that on {{traditional}} 32-note pedalboards used in church pipe organs, the top seven notes were seldom used. The Hammond Concert models E, RT, RT-2, RT-3 and D-100 had 32-note American Guild of Organists (AGO) pedalboards {{going up to the}} G above middle C as the top note. The RT-2, RT-3 and D-100 also contained a separate solo pedal system that had its own volume control and various other features. Spinet models have 12- or 13-note miniature pedalboards.|$|E
