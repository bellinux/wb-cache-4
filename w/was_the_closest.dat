5|$|Early in the tour, Tallon struck an unbeaten 17 on a damp {{pitch in}} a low-scoring match as Australia {{defeated}} Yorkshire by four wickets. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> that the tourists came to defeat for the tour.|$|E
5|$|Four {{ballots were}} {{taken on the}} {{afternoon}} of June 11, and they revealed a deadlock. With 493 votes needed to nominate, Wood <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> with 314; Lowdon had 289. The best Harding had done was 65. Chairman Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, the Senate Majority Leader, adjourned the convention about 7p.m.|$|E
5|$|Burrows <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> {{friend on}} the Canucks to former {{teammate}} Luc Bourdon, {{who died in a}} motorcycle accident in May 2008. In the hockey season following his death, Burrows occasionally celebrated goals with a bow-and-arrow mime, a gesture that Bourdon himself did after scoring during his junior career. He and his wife (girlfriend at the time) remained close to Bourdon's girlfriend, Charlene Ward.|$|E

5|$|Henry's tenure {{began with}} a double victory over 2003 Rugby World Cup winners England in 2004. The two games had an {{aggregate}} score of 72–15, and England were kept try-less. Despite the winning start to Henry's tenure, the Tri-Nations was a mixed success with two wins and two losses. The competition <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> ever, bonus points decided the outcome, and New Zealand finishing last. The 2004 season finished with three wins in Europe, including a record 45–6 victory over France under new captain and outside centre Tana Umaga.|$|E
5|$|Hood <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> to {{completion}} and her construction was continued {{in case the}} Germans managed to complete any of their new battlecruisers. Admiral Beatty continually pressed to have Hoods construction expedited and for her sisters to be restarted, but the War Cabinet refused to approve either measure as nothing could be sacrificed in the shipbuilding programme to this end. After {{the end of the}} war the three suspended ships were cancelled as they could not fully incorporate the lessons of the war.|$|E
5|$|Lysaker Station <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> {{railway station}} to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. From 27 May 1990, Scandinavian Airlines System and the Norwegian State Railways started a {{cooperation}} to better {{the connection between}} rail and airline services. The project included the station being branded as Lysaker/Fornebu and dedicated shuttle buses running from the station to the airport terminal. NSB changed their scheduled so all InterCity Express and long distance trains on the Drammen Line started stopping at Lysaker.|$|E

5|$|Nebraska widened {{its lead}} with a 33-yard {{touchdown}} run six {{minutes into the}} second half, but Tech answered right back with a 33-yard touchdown pass on its subsequent possession. The score cut Nebraska's lead to 24–21. Unfortunately for the Hokies, that score <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> they would get to a lead as Nebraska's offense began to wear down the Tech defense. Nebraska scored another touchdown {{in the fourth quarter}}, then racked up 10points in the fourth quarter to secure the victory. Nebraska won, 41–21.|$|E
5|$|One of Loring's major {{secondary}} missions included {{serving as}} the headquarters for the 45th Air Division from 8 October 1954 to 18 January 1958, and on 20 November 1958. The host wing at Loring was the 42d Bombardment Wing for all but {{a small portion of}} its early existence. Loring was primarily home to active duty units, although this changed in the 1980s, when the Massachusetts Air National Guard's 101st Fighter Squadron sent a detachment to Loring. As the base <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> in the U.S. to Europe, it also functioned as an important stopover point.|$|E
5|$|The 1974–75 NHL {{season was}} memorable for the Sabres' Stanley Cup Finals appearance.

The Sabres defeated original six teams Chicago Black Hawks and Montreal Canadiens {{on their way to a}} Finals appearance against the Philadelphia Flyers. The Sabres lost the series four games to two. 1975 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> Perreault would come to winning the Stanley Cup.|$|E

5|$|The Australians then {{proceeded}} to play Yorkshire, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling. Bradman rested himself and returned to London, so his deputy Lindsay Hassett led the team. Yorkshire were bowled out in difficult batting conditions for 71, before Australia replied with 101. The hosts were then bowled out for 89. Chasing 60 for victory, the Australian top order collapsed to 6/31. Neil Harvey and Don Tallon survived a dropped catch and a stumping opportunity, before seeing Australia home by four wickets. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> Australia came to defeat for the whole tour.|$|E
5|$|This low-scoring game <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> that Australia came {{to defeat}} on the tour. The {{game was played}} in cold, blustery, {{overcast}} and wet conditions that suited spin bowlers. Yorkshire made only 71 in their first innings. Miller mixed medium-paced off-breaks with his fast bowling and this combination returned him 6/42. At the other end Johnston bowled his left arm orthodox spin and took 4/22 from 26 overs. Together the pair bowled almost unchanged, delivering 49.3 of 54.3 overs. Australia struggled in reply and stumps were called when they fell to 4/38.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War on 25 June 1950, the 24th Infantry Division <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> unit to the Korean Peninsula, and in July, Red Cloud's company was among the first units into the country. The division was heavily engaged throughout July by North Korean troops as it attempted to stem their invasion of South Korea, and the 19th Infantry saw action in the Battle of Taejon, fighting at the Kum River before being forced out of Taejon.|$|E
50|$|The main way to {{get around}} Nash is via a {{motorised}} vehicle as <b>the</b> parish <b>is</b> in a remote area.

5|$|After an offseason {{contract}} {{dispute between}} Joss, Toledo and Cleveland, he debuted with the Cleveland club in April 1902. Joss {{led the league}} in shutouts that year. By 1905, Joss had completed the first of his four consecutive 20-win seasons. Off the field, Joss worked as a newspaper sportswriter from 1906 until his death. In 1908, he pitched a perfect game during a tight pennant race that saw Cleveland finish a half-game out of first place; it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> that Joss came to a World Series berth. The 1910 season was his last, and Joss missed most of the year due to injury.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{claiming}} the premiership in 1945, Eastern Suburbs {{failed to make}} the finals for the following seven seasons. A runners-up finish in 1960 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> the club came to {{claiming the}} premiership during this era. Eastern Suburbs were soundly defeated 31–6 in the grand final that year, by the famous record-beating St George outfit. In 1966, the club fell to new depths and was winless {{for the first time in}} its history. It was also the last occasion in which the Roosters won the wooden spoon until claiming it again in the 2009 season. It ended a poor run for Eastern Suburbs; from 1963 to 1966, they won 8 of 72 matches, finishing second to last in 1964 and last in the other three years. The club underwent a renaissance in 1967 after appointing Jack Gibson as coach (1967–68), and introducing a new emblem on the playing jerseys, the rooster.|$|E
5|$|Diarra {{also participated}} in European {{competition}} with Bordeaux during the season. He played in four matches during the club's UEFA Cup campaign. Bordeaux reached the Round of 32 where the club was eliminated by Belgian club Anderlecht on a 3–2 aggregate scoreline. In the Coupe de France, Bordeaux reached the quarter-finals. Diarra appeared in all four matches the team contested, which included playing 120 minutes in back-to-back rounds. He scored two more goals for the club; both of which came {{in the league in}} wins over Metz and Rennes. Bordeaux finished the season in second place; four points behind the champions Lyon. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> gap Lyon had endured since the 2003–04 season when the club won the league by three points over Paris Saint-Germain. Diarra finished the season with 44 total appearances and four goals.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council {{voted to}} send {{assistance}} to the collapsing country and U.S. President Harry S. Truman ordered ground troops to the country. U.S. forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing {{since the end of}} World War II, five years earlier, and Shadrick's division <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> to the warzone. Under the command of Major General William F. Dean, the division was understrength and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. In spite of these deficiencies the division was ordered into South Korea, tasked with taking the initial shock of the North Korean advances until the rest of the Eighth United States Army could arrive and establish a defense.|$|E
5|$|Patton's opponent, Republican Larry Forgy, {{hurt his}} {{campaign}} by aligning {{himself with the}} Christian right, alienating moderates in both parties, particularly in Louisville. He also openly opposed the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA), passed in 1990 during the administration of Wallace G. Wilkinson. Republican supporters of education reform deserted his campaign and helped form a bi-partisan coalition supporting KERA. Traditional Democratic voting blocs such as organized labor and African-Americans turned out in force for Patton. To further undermine Forgy, Patton reminded voters of the budget cuts by Congressional Republicans to programs affecting the elderly. These issues ultimately delivered a Patton victory of 500,787votes to 479,227. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> Kentucky gubernatorial election in 32years, and {{marked the first time}} an eastern Kentuckian had won the governorship since Bert T. Combs in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after George's {{accession}} to his paternal dukedom, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, who was second-in-line to the English and Scottish thrones, died. By {{the terms of}} the English Act of Settlement 1701, George's mother, Sophia, was designated as the heir to the English throne if the then reigning monarch (William III) and his sister-in-law, Princess Anne of Denmark (later Queen Anne) died without surviving issue. The succession was so designed because Sophia <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> Protestant relative of the British royal family. Fifty-six Catholics with superior hereditary claims were bypassed. The likelihood of any of them converting to Protestantism {{for the sake of the}} succession was remote; some had already refused.|$|E
