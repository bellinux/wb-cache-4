25|$|Pakistan {{initially}} {{struggled in}} their reply, losing two very early wickets to be 12/2 at lunch on day 2, and {{they lost their}} 3rd wicket before the score reached 100. However, Inzamam-ul-Haq continued his dominance over England's attack, and only left the crease due to a hand injury. Mohammad Yousuf also built on his good form, and profited from being dropped on 16. In fact, he would eventually bat through the entire third day, which <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> one for England where their only success was the wicket of the nightwatchman, Shoaib Akhtar, and that was only after {{he had made a}} score of 38.|$|E
25|$|These models {{rely on the}} {{assumption}} that asset price fluctuations are the result of a well-behaved random or stochastic process. This is why mainstream models (such as the famous Black-Scholes model) use normal probabilistic distributions to describe price movements. For all practical purposes, extreme variations can be ignored. Mandelbrot thought this <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> way to look at financial markets. For him, the distribution of price movements is not normal and has the property of kurtosis, where fat tails abound. This is a more faithful representation of financial markets: the movements of the Dow index for the past hundred years reveals a troubling frequency of violent movements. Still, conventional models used {{by the time of the}} 2008 financial crisis ruled out these extreme variations and considered they can only happen every 10,000 years. An obvious conclusion from Mandelbrot’s work is that greater regulation in financial markets is indispensable. Other contributions of his work for the study of stock market behaviour are the creation of new approaches to evaluate risk and avoid unanticipated financial collapses.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wildest}} and largest ninth-inning {{comeback}} win all season, the Cardinals {{at home on}} August 8, scored all five of their runs {{in the bottom of}} the ninth after two outs, for a 5-4 win. Previously, the team <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> 2-45 when trailing after eight innings. The team fell into a 0-4 hole, and were 0-for-11 with runners in scoring position. It was the 10th time in the last 15 games that a starter could not get to the sixth inning. Down to his last strike at 1-2, Brandon Moss got the tying run in with a bases-loaded walk, and Yadier Molina then finished off the improbable comeback win by getting hit in the ribs by a pitch. The Cardinals have won three of the last four Major League games to end on a walk-off hit-by-pitch. It happened most recently for St. Louis on Aug. 14, 2014, when Jon Jay took a pitch off his body. That was also against the Reds. With the win, the team got its 59th win against 53 losses, tying the Miami Marlins for the second Wild Card spot with 50 games remaining in the season. Michael Wacha could go only five innings, as the fifth starter in a week to not get to the sixth inning.|$|E

Liverpool manager Bob Paisley was delighted with players after their performance in the second leg: [...] "The second half was the longest 45 minutes of my life.

Drummer Phil Selway said: [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> lot of soul-searching [...] To do that again on another album would be excruciatingly boring." [...] Yorke, Radiohead's primary lyricist, said at the time, [...] "we could really fall back on just doing another miserable, morbid and negative record lyrically, but I don't really want to, at all. And I'm deliberately just writing down all the positive things that I hear or see. I'm not able to put them into music yet and I don't want to just force it." ...|$|E

While Emily consistently described her father in a warm manner, her correspondence suggests {{that her mother was}} regularly cold and aloof. In a letter to a confidante, Emily wrote she [...] "always ran Home to Awe [...] when a child, if anything befell me.

500|$|Anti-German {{sentiment}} rose {{among the}} British public, in newspapers, and in elite gentlemen's clubs, where resentment was inflamed by Admiral Lord Charles Beresford despite Churchill's remonstrances. Driven by public opinion, Churchill asked Prince Louis to resign as First Sea Lord on 27 October 1914. When acceptance of Battenberg's resignation was delayed by the King's {{opposition to the}} appointment of Fisher in his place, Louis wrote to Churchill, [...] "I beg of you to release me. I am {{on the verge of}} breaking down & I cannot use my brain for anything". On 13 November he wrote to Churchill's Naval Secretary, Rear-Admiral Horace Hood, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> wrench, but I had no choice from the moment it was made clear to me that the Government did not feel themselves strong enough to support me by some public pronouncement." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the tour}} was confirmed, Mars {{and his band}} started {{preparing}} for it. His manager at the time, Brandon Creed, said that Mars was more focused and excited than nervous. He furthered that the singer {{spent most of his}} time rehearsing, preparing, directing and choreographing everything. Commenting on the development, Creed said [...] "We're going into rehearsals now, so I don't have much to share, but it's going to be ... incredible ... it's hectic, but it's amazing ... It's a thrill to work with an artist so talented". After evaluating the American Express and Citibank suggestions regarding a presale, WME decided not to pursue the idea, to which Mars' management agreed upon, a decision which ending up further promoting the Moonshine Jungle Tour. The idea was received with some skepticism within the team; some believed it was a good idea but most were reluctant and thought it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> idea, as buyers find presale a crucial element of tours. Cameron Duddy was chosen as the music director for the first leg of the North American tour.|$|E

500|$|The ninth track from Unorthodox Jukebox, [...] "Money Makes Her Smile", is {{the result}} of a trip to a strip club done by Mars and Diplo, who {{afterwards}} decided to create an [...] "anthem" [...] for it, since Mars' debut solo single <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> song to be played in such place, according to him. The recording was described as a [...] "strip-club-directed banger", infused with disco elements. Its composition includes [...] "rapid-fire chants, breathless percussion, propulsive electronic blips" [...] along with [...] "rave sirens and hardcore punk rattle". Lyrically, the song describes a gold digger who can only be satisfied by [...] "fat stacks of money". The album's final song of the standard edition, [...] "If I Knew", is a Sam Cooke-inspired ballad which incorporates soul and doo-wop nuances. It lyrically delves on themes of regret. [...] "Old & Crazy", a duet between Mars and Esperanza Spalding, was included on the deluxe version of Unorthodox Jukebox. Jeff Bhasker, one of the track's producers, confessed that the song is reminiscent of the sound of a 1920s Paris club. He went on explaining that its process began with Emile Haynie producing a beat and Bhasker adding a sample of a Django Reinhardt recording over it.|$|E
500|$|On 30 January 1972 Lee's first wife, Gladys Merredew, {{died in a}} fire {{at their}} seventeenth-century home in Oare, Kent which also left Lee hospitalised. According to actor Jack Warner, [...] "Bernard and Gladys had a lovely seventeenth-century cottage in the Kent village of Oare, {{and it was there}} she died tragically in a fire early in 1972. Bernard and Gladys were trapped in their bedroom when the fire started on the ground floor. Bernard escaped through a window and ran to get a ladder in an attempt to rescue Gladys, but unhappily was unsuccessful. It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> end to a long and happy marriage." [...] In February 1972 Lee was mugged and robbed by two youths. After the mugging and fire, Lee turned to drink, [...] By chance Lee met Richard Burton in a pub, who, upon hearing of Lee's problems, gave him a cheque for $6,000 {{together}} with a note saying that everyone has a spot of trouble once in a while. Burton's gift assisted Lee in overcoming his depression. In 1975 both Lee and Lois Maxwell accepted roles in their usual Bond characters in the poorly received French James Bond spoof, From Hong Kong with Love.|$|E
500|$|Bond next {{created the}} role of Mad Margaret in Ruddigore (1887; {{originally}} spelt [...] "Ruddygore"), which she regarded as her favourite of all the Gilbert and Sullivan roles, [...] "for it gave me the chance to show what I really could do as an actress." [...] The part was her largest to date, and Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte made her audition it {{for them to be}} sure that she could handle the responsibility. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> ordeal. [...] I saw the three white faces looming out of the darkness as they sat close together; criticizing me, talking me over, with cold managerial detachment. It nearly killed me. [...] Perhaps it gave an added realism and abandon to my simulated madness, for indeed I was nearly mad with fear – but at any rate I came through triumphantly, they were all three of them delighted." [...] Bond was particularly nervous on opening night. [...] "I shook and tottered so much that Mad Margaret's staff was no mere adjunct, but an absolute necessity. Without it I should have fallen as I stood in the wings waiting to go on. Then some one gave me a push; I was there, on the stage, in the glare of the footlights, hundreds of eyes fixed on me, tier upon tier of dim white faces rising from floor to ceiling in the gloom. It was enough; I forgot myself, I was Mad Margaret and no one else. I made an immense success." [...] Cellier and Bridgeman seconded this assessment: ...|$|E

2500|$|Post-war, {{women were}} {{returned}} {{to many of the}} mundane jobs they occupied before the war started. Where once the army represented an escape from domestic life and liberty, it now returned to the male-dominated field it was before the war. Women who served in the batteries as gunners and searchlight-operators became secretaries and clerks. [...] "Demob (demobilisation) was a big disappointment to a lot of us. It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> and wonderful war. I wouldn't have missed it for anything; some of the friends we made were forever” one female recounted after being dismissed from service to return to her normal job. Married women were released from service sooner {{at the end of the}} war, so they could return home before their husbands to ensure the home was ready when he returned from the front. Despite being largely unrecognised for their wartime efforts in the forces, the participation of women in World War II allowed for the founding of permanent women’s forces. Britain instituted these permanent forces in 1949, and the Women’s Voluntary Services are still a standing reserve force today.|$|E
2500|$|Deck {{specifically}} {{claimed that}} his rights to due process, prescribed by the 5th and 14th Amendments, were violated. Deck’s counsel {{made it clear}} that there was no reason such as a court disturbance to permit such shackling. In Deck’s argument to the Supreme Court, it was also argued that Deck’s 6th Amendment rights had been violated {{on the grounds of the}} Confrontation Clause. Deck’s shackling told the jury that Deck was a dangerous person and was shackled to protect the people in the courtroom. Therefore, the jury had a picture in their mind that Deck <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> person. Deck’s attorneys referred to this idea as prejudice towards Deck. Deck’s counsel argued that this meant that the jury was influenced by arbitrary details in deciding Deck’s sentence, not just the presented facts. [...] It was made clear that Deck could not cross-examine or defend against the idea of bias and prejudice against him. As a result his right to confront witnesses as stated in the 6th Amendment (as well as idea of an impartial jury) was violated by the shackles. Also, Deck’s counsel argued that the shackles violated the defendant's rights that “give meaning to the defendant’s right to be present at his trial.” [...] It was argued that the shackles limited Deck from freely conversing with his counsel, and that they prevented him from taking the stand to defend himself. The defense wrote that this would increase the chances of Deck being sentenced to death by the jury which made the shackling unconstitutional.|$|E
2500|$|Lynch got {{approval}} from Propaganda to switch projects; however, production {{was scheduled to}} begin {{two months after the}} rights had been purchased, forcing the director to work fast. He had Cage and Dern read Gifford's book and wrote a draft in a week. By Lynch's own admission, his first draft was [...] "depressing and pretty much devoid of happiness, and no one wanted to make it". Lynch did not like the ending in Gifford’s book where Sailor and Lula split up for good. For Lynch, [...] "it honestly didn’t seem real, considering the way they felt about each other. It didn’t seem one bit real! It had a certain coolness, but I couldn’t see it". It was at this point that the director's love of The Wizard of Oz (1939) began to influence the script he was writing and he included a reference to the [...] "yellow brick road". Lynch remembers, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>awful</b> tough world and there was something about Sailor being a rebel. But a rebel with a dream of the Wizard of Oz is kinda like a beautiful thing". Samuel Goldwyn, Jr. read an early draft of the screenplay and did not like Gifford’s ending either, so Lynch changed it. However, the director was worried that this change made the film too commercial, [...] "much more commercial to make a happy ending yet, if I had not changed it, so that people wouldn’t say I was trying to be commercial, I would have been untrue to what the material was saying".|$|E
