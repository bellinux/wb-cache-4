The siting of significant collections at the water's edge on reclaimed land {{next to one of}} the world's most active faults has resulted in concern by some people. There has been criticism of the 'sideshow' nature of some exhibits (primarily the Time <b>Warp</b> <b>section,</b> which has since closed). There has also been criticism that some exhibits were not given due reverence. For example, a major work by Colin McCahon was at one stage juxtaposed with a 1950s refrigerator in a New Zealand culture exhibition.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{and robust}} {{correspondence}} calculations {{are very important}} in many medical and biological applications. Often, the correspondence calculation forms part of a rigid registration algorithm, but accurate correspondences are especially important for elastic registration algorithms and for quantifying changes over time.

A robust corresponding point is calculated by determining the sensitivity of a correspondence to movement of the point being matched. If the correspondence is reliable, a perturbation {{in the position of}} this point should not result in a large movement of the correspondence. A measure of reliability is also calculated.

40|$|In this study, the {{nonlinear}} vibrations {{analysis of}} an inclined pinned-pinned self-weight Timoshenko beam made of linear, homogenous and isotropic material with a constant cross section and finite length {{subjected to a}} traveling mass/force with constant velocity is investigated. The nonlinear coupled partial differential equations of motion for the rotation of <b>warped</b> cross <b>section,</b> longitudinal and transverse displacements are derived using the Hamilton's principle. These nonlinear coupled PDEs are solved by applying the Galerkin's method to obtain dynamic responses of the beam. The dynamic magnification factor and normalized time histories of mid-point of the beam are obtained for various load velocity ratios and the outcome results have been compared to the results with those obtained from linear solution. The influence of the large deflections caused by a stretching effect due to the beam's fixed ends is captured. It was seen that existence of quadratic-cubic nonlinear terms in the nonlinear governing coupled PDEs of motion causes stiffening (hardening) behavior of the dynamic responses of the self-weight beam under the act of a traveling mass as well as equivalent concentrated moving force. Furthermore, in {{a case where the}} object leaves the beam, its planar motion path is derived and the targeting accuracy is investigated and compared with those from the rigid solution assumption...|$|R
40|$|Reflection of {{a bundle}} of {{coherent}} light on the <b>warped</b> cross <b>section</b> of a prismatic bar submitted to torsion forms a caustic on a receiver plane. From the mathematical expression of this curve and the theory of reflected caustics, {{it is possible to}} evaluate accurately the warping function of the cross section. Using this idea, it was possible to study the torsion problem in prismatic bars with sections which were equilateral triangles and squares. It was observed that the shape of the caustic is an hypocycloid curve with three or four cusps respectively. By evaluating the warping function by using elements from the respective caustics it was possible to find out that, for the triangular cross section, the expression for the warping function coincided exactly with the expression given by the exact solution of the problem. For the square cross section, a closed-form solution for its warping function was readily derived, to which the series approximation solution differed only by a few percent at maximum for the shear stresses. Since the method can be readily extended to any canonical polygonic cross section, it constitutes a general solution for the torsion of prismatic bars, which approximates their exact deformations better than the solutions based on the Saint-Vénant assumptions. © 1989 Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc...|$|R
