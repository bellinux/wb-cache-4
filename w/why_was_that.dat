6000|$|... "You mean if {{he would}} be a {{creature}} of the lord's. And <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> other man so uncivil to me;--the man who was the lord's gamekeeper?" ...|$|E
6000|$|GILMAN. Grocery--I daresay {{you know}} me; or your wife does. They say old Mr Jacob Twisden refused a knighthood. If it's not a rude question, <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>that?</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|OK, so you {{obviously}} {{prefer not to}} give much away in interviews. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|... "However, Lord, {{the idea}} of a self will not occur to them, nor will {{the idea of}} a living being, {{the idea of a}} soul, or the idea of a person occur. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> Any such idea of a self is indeed idealess, any idea of a living being, idea of a soul, or idea of a person <b>is</b> indeed idealess. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> Because the Buddhas and Lords are free of all ideas." ...|$|R
500|$|John Norvell {{left the}} Aurora & Gazette and {{his job as}} editor because he {{disagreed}} with what he felt was the newspaper's editorial approval of a movement towards a European class system. When Norvell and John Walker founded The Inquirer they wanted the newspaper to represent all people {{and not just the}} higher classes. The newly launched newspaper supported Jeffersonian democracy and President Andrew Jackson, and it declared support for the right of the minority's opinion to be heard. A legend about the founding of The Inquirer states that Norvell [...] said, [...] "There could be no better name than The Inquirer. In a free state, there should always be an inquirer asking on behalf of the people: 'Why <b>was</b> this done? <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> necessary work not done? <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> man put forward? <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> law proposed? <b>Why?</b> Why? Why?'" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{case was}} very critical. The fever, if not stopped, might and would carry off the young fellow: {{he must be}} bled forthwith: the mother must be {{informed}} of this necessity. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> other young lady brought with her? She was {{out of place in}} a sick-room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wow!" [...] he said, when I had finished, [...] "you are clever as a baboon, Macumazahn. That {{was a fine}} {{trick to}} set a trap for Bangu and his Amakoba dogs and bait it with his own cattle. But {{they tell me that}} you refused your share of those cattle. Now, <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> Macumazahn?" ...|$|E
60|$|Protestants have persecuted Catholics, {{but they}} did not take their {{livelihoods}} away from them. The Catholics have persecuted the Protestants with bloody and awful bitterness, but they never closed agriculture and the handicrafts against them. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>that?</b> That has the candid look of genuine religious persecution, not a trade-union boycott in a religious dispute.|$|E
6000|$|... "And whose doing {{has this}} <b>been?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> it <b>that</b> I may {{not think of}} past times? <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> it <b>that</b> all thought, all {{memories}} are denied to me? Who <b>was</b> it <b>that</b> broke the cup at the very fountain?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> father? How <b>is</b> it <b>that</b> a {{light wind}} blows us away sideways; {{and that a}} strong wind, instead of blowing us more, blows us less?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I; {{your good}} master's private {{cupboard}} does not interest me. Now I {{want to know}} something more. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> beautiful cousin of yours not married? Has she no suitors?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> ma'am, {{but because}} {{her mother was a}} poor {{creature}} from town, that had never broke her to her work. I never had the trouble with a girl of my own I had with her. 'It's all for your good, Lovedy,' I says to her, and poor child, maybe she wishes herself back again." ...|$|E
60|$|Now the Ceremony being over, he ask'd the Witch if the Business was done? She said yes. Well, {{but says}} he, have I sold my Soul to the Devil? Yes, says she, you have, and {{you gave him}} Possession, when you deliver'd the two Fire-sticks to him. To him! says he, <b>why,</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Devil? Yes, says the old Hag. At which the young Man was in a terrible Fright for a while, but it went off again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not joking," [...] said she. [...] "I was not {{thinking}} of Mr. Trevor, but of you. I like you, Mr. Crocker. You may not believe it, but I do." [...] For {{the life of me}} I could think of no fitting reply to this declaration. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> abominable word [...] "like" [...] ever put into the English language? [...] "Yes, I like you," [...] she continued meditatively, [...] "in the face {{of the fact that you}} persist in disliking me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very {{few people}} do that," [...] said Mrs. Durrant. [...] "I daresay you <b>were</b> never taught. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> Sir Jasper?--Sir Jasper Bigham--Mr. Flanders. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> nobody taught {{anything}} {{that they ought to}} know, Sir Jasper?" [...] She left them standing against the wall.|$|R
6000|$|... --Very well, then, Temple continued, still {{addressing}} Glynn, and if Jesus {{suffered the}} children to come why does the church send them all to hell if they die unbaptized? <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{where the}} devil is the woman?' said the {{impatient}} gentleman, catching up his hat. 'Why isn't she here? <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> woman always {{out of the way}} when she is most wanted?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She died expressing her eager {{desire to}} see me. Can it be, then--can strong and earnest wishes, formed during the last agony of nature, survive its catastrophe, surmount the awful bounds of the spiritual world, and place before us its {{inhabitants}} in the hues and colouring of life? And <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> manifested to the eye, which could not unfold its tale to the ear?' ('Her withered lips moved fast, although no sound issued from them.') 'And wherefore should a breach {{be made in the}} laws of nature, yet its purpose remain unknown?' ...|$|E
60|$|Nour. 'Tis true; {{but who was}} e'er in love, and wise? <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> fatal knot of {{marriage}} tied, Which did, by making us too near, divide? Divides me from my sex! for heaven, I find, Excludes but me alone of womankind. I stand with guilt confounded, lost with shame, And yet made wretched only by a name. If names have such command on human life, Love sure's a name that's more divine than wife. That sovereign power all guilt from action takes, At least the stains are beautiful it makes.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{could not}} do it, sir," [...] she told him, [...] "not you nor anybody else. The door is thicker than my fist, of solid oak. It was a {{mechanic}} from New York who fitted the locks. I have heard it said in the village--Bill Hamas, the carpenter, declares that there are double doors. The workmen who were employed here were housed in a tent upon the beach and sent home the day they finished their job. They were never allowed in the village. They were foreigners, most of them. They came from nobody knows where, and when they had finished they disappeared. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> sir? What is there inside which Mr. Fentolin needs to guard so carefully?" ...|$|E
30|$|<b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> In {{order to}} {{understand}} these stylized facts {{about the development of}} the service industry in China, it is necessary to consider some aspects of the evolution of the economy, especially since the early 1990 s.|$|R
6000|$|They {{were silent}} for a few minutes, and then Scott resumed: [...] "I {{understand}} Miss Strange means {{to look for the}} vein next summer and you <b>are</b> going. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> since you don't believe her father's tale?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{influence}} exercised against me?" [...] Tallente demanded. [...] "I am {{thankful to}} have an opportunity of asking you that question, Dartrey. Surely you would reckon me more of a people's man than these Whigs and Coalitionists?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} of that?" [...] cried the detective, with the air of a showman exhibiting his show. [...] "This was {{overlooked}} because it was in the darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The murderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where it has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See that candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall." ...|$|E
6000|$|Why was King James and his popish posterity entirely {{excluded}} {{for ever}} from enjoying the imperial crown of these realms?[15] Why {{were so many}} acts of parliament made to extinguish the hopes of his race, and of their party, and for farther security of her majesty's person and government? Why was the settlement of the succession in a protestant line made the principal reason of uniting the two kingdoms together? And <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> union so vigorously opposed by all those that adhered to the jacobite interest? Was this to illustrate {{the return of the}} abdicated line, and by the greatness of the nation's endeavour for keeping out the pretender, to justify his using them accordingly when he comes in? ...|$|E
6000|$|And so he trod in weary circles, {{returning}} {{always to}} the same point, with an almost audible groan. [...] "Why, <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> charming girl involved in all this uncanny, hellish, destructive business? Clarke claims her. On him her fate depends. Perhaps at this moment her name and hideous reproductions of her face are being printed in all the sensational papers of the city. Oh, that crazy preacher! It may be that he has already made her rescue impossible." [...] And always the dark, disturbing thought came at the end to trouble him. [...] "Can she ever regain a normal relation with the world--even if I should interfere? She should have been freed from this traffic long ago. Can the science of suggestion reach her? Am I already too late?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "And if you astrologers answer <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> {{precisely}} because of this distance and smallness <b>that</b> their influences <b>are</b> negligible, then <b>why</b> <b>is</b> it <b>that</b> you claim a great influence for the smallest heavenly body, Mercury? <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> it <b>that</b> you have given an influence to al-Ra's and al-Dhanab, which are two imaginary points and descending nodes?" ...|$|R
50|$|Perceiving {{earth as}} earth, he conceives things about earth, he conceives things in earth, he conceives things {{coming out of}} earth, he conceives earth as 'mine,' he delights in earth. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> Because he has not comprehended it, I tell you.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> graceful female here [...] With yon red hunter of the deer? [...] Of gentle mien and shape, {{she seems}} [...] For civil halls design'd; [...] Yet with the stately savage walks, [...] As she were of his kind. [...] --Pinkney.|$|R
6000|$|Why was {{the union}} {{declared}} to be unalterable, and, as some say, the power thereby {{taken out of}} the hands of the British parliament to change the settlement of the crown, or to name any other persons than those of the illustrious house of Hanover to succeed; and, above all, <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> severest of all oaths, the abjuration, contrived; by which it is rendered impossible for this nation, upon any pretence whatsoever, to receive the pretender but with the black stigma of an abominable perjury? Was this that, with the greater reverence to laws, and the greater regard to the solemnity of a national oath, we might all turn tail upon our principles, and in defiance of God and the laws, bow our knees to an abjured pretender? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mysterious?" [...] exclaimed the girl, with passionate wrath; [...] "I {{call them}} cruel and unjust, pater! What have I done, that He {{should have done}} this to me? Andor loved me and I loved him, he wrote me a letter full of love, begging for a word from me to assure him that I would always love him and that I would wait for him. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> letter kept from me? Why was I not allowed to reply to it? My father would not have kept the letter from me, {{had he not been}} {{stricken}} down with paralysis on the very day when it came. It is God who kept my happiness away from me. It is God who has spoilt my life and condemned me to regrets and wretchedness, when I had done nothing to deserve such a cruel fate!" ...|$|E
60|$|She went on her {{way across}} the fields, {{sometimes}} above the fog, sometimes below it, not much perplexed by its presence except when the track was so indefinite that it {{ceased to be a}} guide to the next stile. The dampness was such that innumerable earthworms lay in couples across the path till, startled even by her light tread, they withdrew suddenly into their holes. She kept clear of all trees. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>that?</b> There was no danger of lightning on such a morning as this. But though the roads were dry the fog had gathered in the boughs, causing them to set up such a dripping as would go clean through the protecting handkerchief like bullets, and spoil the ribbons beneath. The beech and ash were particularly shunned, for they dripped more maliciously than any. It was an instance of woman's keen appreciativeness of nature's moods and peculiarities: a man crossing those fields might hardly have perceived that the trees dripped at all.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the study}} sought out {{to analyze the}} allele {{frequency}} spectrum (AFS) in western lowland gorillas. The reason <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> AFS knowledge can help give information regarding demographics and evolutionary processes. The AFS has determined that western lowland gorillas display a deficit of rare alleles.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>why</b> <b>is</b> it <b>that</b> I love him? MERELY BECAUSE HE IS MASCULINE, I think.|$|R
60|$|Let us now {{change the}} scene. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> crowded {{assembly}} so attentive--so silent? Who is speaking? It is our old friend, the little disconsolate schoolboy. But {{his eyes are}} flashing with intellect, his face fervent with emotion, his voice breathes like music, and every mind is enchained.|$|R
