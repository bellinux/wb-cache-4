50|$|In 1829, Reade became curate of Halifax Parish Church {{where he}} befriended amateur {{meteorologist}} John Waterhouse, {{who would later}} invent the <b>Waterhouse</b> <b>stop.</b> In 1832 he took a part-time curacy at Harrow Weald, and in 1834 became proprietor of a school in Peckham.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Waterhouse</b> <b>stop</b> or Waterhouse {{diaphragm}} is an interchangeable diaphragm with an aperture (hole) {{for controlling}} {{the entry of}} light into a camera. A thin piece of metal (the diaphragm) is drilled with a hole (the aperture); a set of these with varying hole sizes makes up a set of Waterhouse stops, corresponding to what today we call f-stops or f-numbers. Photographic lens makers provided slots in lens barrels for the insertion of the chosen stop.|$|E
50|$|<b>Waterhouse</b> <b>stops</b> {{were also}} used in {{photographic}} enlargers in the darkroom.|$|R
50|$|John Waterhouse (3 August 1806 - 13 February 1879) was a British {{astronomer}} and meteorologist {{who invented}} <b>Waterhouse</b> <b>stops.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Cassell's Cyclopedia of Photography 1911 {{identifies}} John Waterhouse of Halifax as {{the inventor}} in 1858 of <b>Waterhouse</b> <b>stops,</b> [...] "a separate stop being required for each opening." ...|$|R
50|$|One of his cameras was an American large format camera, {{made for}} 13×18 in (33×46 cm) plates, {{equipped}} with separate shutter (Thornton-Pickard Snap-Shot, 1-1/80 sec), Aplanat B no 4 lens from E Suter (Basel) and separate <b>Waterhouse</b> <b>stop</b> (1:4 or 1:8). He also used three smaller folding cameras for the format 10×15 cm. In later life, when {{he no longer}} photographed professionally, he got a modern camera for 135 film and took both color and black-and-white photos.|$|E
50|$|Kingslake {{has more}} {{definite}} histories {{for some other}} diaphragm types, such as M. Noton's adjustable cat eye diaphragm of two sliding squares in 1856, and the <b>Waterhouse</b> <b>stops</b> of John <b>Waterhouse</b> in 1858.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} selectable <b>stops</b> {{were the}} <b>Waterhouse</b> <b>stops</b> of 1858, named for John Waterhouse. These were sets of accessory brass plates with sized holes, mounted through a {{slot in the}} side of the lens structure.|$|R
50|$|The Repro-Claron {{is a line}} of 4-element, 4-group lenses {{optimized}} for 1:1 reproduction ratios, but still usable at infinity. The f/9 lenses also have a slot for between-the-lens filtration or <b>Waterhouse</b> <b>stops,</b> the latter of which are available in f/128, f/180, and f/260.|$|R
50|$|Today, <b>Waterhouse</b> <b>stops</b> {{are largely}} obsolete; most modern {{photographic}} lenses {{are made with}} an iris diaphragm. Some compact digital cameras use 2-hole diaphragms for limited aperture control. One modern device that still uses interchangeable stops is the Lensbaby. Another is a new Petzval lens being crowdfunded by Lomography.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} years of photography, a lens could be fitted with one of a set of {{interchangeable}} diaphragms https://books.google.com/books?vid=0OrF3Gg18eOZGCnsbWwn&id=AN6d4zTjquwC&pg=PA83, often as brass strips known as <b>Waterhouse</b> <b>stops</b> or <b>Waterhouse</b> diaphragms. The iris diaphragm in most modern still and video cameras is adjusted by movable blades, simulating the iris of the eye.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, {{one or more}} {{pieces of}} metal would be drilled with various sized holes. The stop could then be chosen by sliding the {{diaphragm}} to different positions in the lens slot. Such multi-aperture diaphragms were also {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>Waterhouse</b> <b>stops,</b> due to their operation based on sliding through a slot in the lens barrel.|$|R
50|$|Over {{a period}} of 8 years (1866-1873), he made {{detailed}} observations of the weather and of the night skies from Well Head, which he published in 1874. A keen photographer, he produced several inventions, including <b>Waterhouse</b> <b>stops</b> for cameras and photographic lenses and an alkaline gold toning bath (see page from 1892 book, figure to the right, below).|$|R
50|$|The Fine-Art XXL line is {{designed}} for ultra-large format shooting, covering 20×24 inches. Both lenses are large and heavy, but are designed with exceptional image quality and a huge 900 mm circle of coverage in mind. The 550 mm lens is a 6/2 construction, giving 78° of coverage, while the 1100 mm lens is 4/4 with 45.7° of coverage. Both lenses are mounted in a Copal 3 shutter, and the longer lens is also available in a barrel mount with <b>Waterhouse</b> <b>stops,</b> if the faster f/14 version is desired.|$|R
5000|$|This {{apparatus}} {{was invented}} by the pioneering 19th-century photographer John Waterhouse of Halifax in 1858. [...] It has also been reported to have been independently invented by Mr. H. R. Smyth, and described by Waterhouse as early as 1856. [...] The innovation was quickly put to use due to its convenience: [...] "Aperture openings were at first controlled by unscrewing the lens and inserting stops of the appropriate size between the lens components, though after 1858 photographers used the more convenient <b>Waterhouse</b> <b>stops</b> which eliminated unscrewing the components." ...|$|R
50|$|A lens {{will most}} often have an {{aperture}} adjustment mechanism, usually an iris diaphragm, {{to regulate the}} amount of light that passes. In early camera models a rotating plate or slider with different sized holes was used. These <b>Waterhouse</b> <b>stops</b> may still be found on modern, specialized lenses. A shutter, to regulate the time during which light may pass, may be incorporated within the lens assembly (for better quality imagery), within the camera, or even, rarely, {{in front of the}} lens. Some cameras with leaf shutters in the lens omit the aperture, and the shutter does double duty.|$|R
50|$|In {{a series}} of flashbacks we see the {{events that led to}} the opening scene. A younger Sheriff Proctor {{witnesses}} the gypsy family, living on his property, engaging in satanic rituals. He threatens the mother with arrest unless she pays him. When she says they have no money, he sexually assaults her. Deputy Waterhouse sees Wyeth and his frightened brothers, then only children, outside. Waterhouse finds Proctor raping the boys' mother. Proctor returns to the cabin with food only to be confronted by the husband who beats him and runs him off. Proctor returns with Waterhouse and kills the father. As Waterhouse protests, the mother shoots at the two policemen. Waterhouse shoots back and fatally wounds her. Proctor shoots the father in the head and aims at Wyeth before <b>Waterhouse</b> <b>stops</b> him. Wyeth kneels over his mother, who whispers something to him before dying. Waterhouse and Proctor then take the two bodies to the quarry.|$|R
5000|$|These are apochromatic dialyts with 4 {{elements}} in 4 groups and an {{angle of view}} of 48° in lengths shorter than 480mm, narrowing to 40° above 760mm. They are optimized for 1:1 reproduction ratios, but also give excellent results in general photography, with extremely low distortion and superior sharpness. These lenses can be found mounted in shutter and as barrel lenses.Only some barrel Apo-Ronars can be remounted into a shutter, for details see http://www.skgrimes.com/lens-mounting/table-of-lenses-fitted-to-shutters [...]Most barrel APO-Ronars have a slot that allows to insert gel filters and <b>waterhouse</b> <b>stops</b> of any shape (for special effects) between the two optical groups, {{but there are also}} APO-Ronars with a fixed f-stop, i.e. a circular plate instead of an iris, and no filter slot.Lengths above 240mm also have a millimeters iris scale that indicates the real iris diameter, in order to calculate with high precision the effective f/stop when you work in close up and repro photography. This scale is typically starting at 2mm corresponding to a f-stop of 120 for a 240mm lens. Such and even higher values are useful for and only for prepress use.The CL-Versions (upcharge, more seldom) have a linear f-stop scale. This is useful for setting precise f-stops, specially when often different values are used.|$|R
