5|$|In 1582, Day's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} quickly. Though weakening, he raced to complete {{another edition of}} Actes and Monuments in 1583, printing it on at least four presses. It was unusual for books of this size and ambition to go beyond one or two printings. Holinshed's Chronicles, the only book of the time to rival the Book of Martyrs in scope and reputation, never <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> third edition.|$|E

5|$|In her {{biography}} of McCracken, The Girl Who Fell Down, dance critic Mary Jo Sagolla says that McCracken is little remembered today, and not widely appreciated for her influence on Fosse, {{and for her}} efforts to encourage him to move from dance to choreography. Though her career <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> sharp decline in the 1950s due to her diabetes, she directly influenced the career of MacLaine, as well as Fosse, and was a pioneer in combining comedy and dance.|$|E
5|$|Many of the drapers {{supported}} Parliament {{during the}} civil war, {{and as a consequence}} the Company was not given royal support after the monarchy was restored in 1660 under Charles II (r. 1660–85). The cloth trade <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> gradual decline after this date.|$|E

Fowler was due to take the fifth and final spot-kick, but the game had already ended when Kuyt slotted home his winning penalty.|$|E

After leaving for a singing lesson in June 1934, Gardiner, a baritone, collapsed. He <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> coma, from which he never woke.

5|$|A beefsteak {{is a type}} of banquet {{in which}} sliced beef {{tenderloin}} is served to diners as all-you-can-eat finger food. The dining style originated in 19th-century New York City as a type of working-class celebration but <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> decline in the mid-20th century. Resurrected by caterers in New Jersey, the beefsteak banquet style is now popular in that state's Bergen and Passaic counties, and is enjoying a revival in New York City, where the style originated, due to the reemergence of a biannual beefsteak in Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the Navy <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> {{period of}} decline. In 1864, the Navy had 51,500men in uniform, and almost 700 ships and about 60 monitor-type coastal ironclads {{which made the}} U.S. Navy the second {{largest in the world}} after the Royal Navy. By 1880 the Navy only had 48 ships in commission, 6,000 men, and the ships and shore {{facilities}} were decrepit but Congress saw no need to spend money to improve them. The Navy was unprepared to fight a major maritime war before 1897.|$|E

Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian people <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
