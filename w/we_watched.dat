25|$|The {{passengers}} {{were put into}} the seven ship's boats:The steamer had struck nearly in the centre; her fore part was sunk very deep, and <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> her with the greatest anxiety {{to see if the}} water gained on her, fearing for the safety of those still on board, and also dreading that if she sank our boats would all be swamped. We rowed backwards and forwards between the rocks and the steamer all night, and a weary time it was. Guns were fired, and rockets sent up; but our signals of distress were not answered, though a light we saw at some distance on the shore made us hopeful that assistance was at hand. The masts were cut down to lighten the ship, and the crash as they fell into the water sounded very fearful.|$|E
500|$|Szilard and Zinn {{conducted}} a simple experiment {{on the seventh}} floor of Pupin Hall at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. Initially nothing registered on the oscilloscope, but then Zinn realized that it was not plugged in. On doing so, they discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible. Szilard later described the event: [...] "We turned the switch and saw the flashes. <b>We</b> <b>watched</b> them for a little while and then we switched everything off and went home." [...] He understood the implications and consequences of this discovery, though. [...] "That night, there was very little {{doubt in my mind that}} the world was headed for grief".|$|E

500|$|The {{director}} of the episode, Bender, conducted an interview with The Wall Street Journal following the airing of the episode, and spoke about filming the play with Arya in Braavos, stating [...] "I staged the whole play, we did it, and the producers came in to watch the rehearsal, including all the fart jokes, all that stuff, some of which was written. So, after <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> the rehearsal, and the guys laughed a lot, I said, 'My only concern is, am I mocking your brilliant show too much?' And they said, 'No, do it more!' They're completely unpretentious, David and Dan, and they loved it." [...] He also noted that several other extra scenes were filmed, but were cut from {{the final version of}} the episode, noting that they will likely be released as deleted scenes on the DVD for the season.|$|E

The 6th Airlanding Brigade headquarters, 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles and the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment landed at LZN, the latter equipped with the Tetrarch light tank– the first time that any tank had been flown into battle by air. Watching the arriving gliders, Major-General Richard Nelson Gale later wrote:"It is impossible to say with what relief <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> this reinforcement arrive." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hunting Trip" [...] {{was written}} by Daniel J. Goor and {{directed}} by series co-creator Greg Daniels. The episode introduced a romantic subplot between the characters Andy and April which continued throughout the second season and into the third. Series co-creator Michael Schur said the pairing was not previously planned, but grew when it was discovered during the filming of [...] "Hunting Trip" [...] that actors Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt had strong comedic chemistry together. However, Schur also said the idea to pair them together in [...] "Hunting Trip" [...] stemmed in part from a line Plaza improvised in the first season finale [...] "Rock Show", when Andy explained his style of music and April replied that she completely understood him. Schur said, [...] "At the time, it was this little nothing, throwaway thing, but when <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> it, we thought {{there might be something}} there." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2006, John Lasseter {{spoke about}} the {{inspiration}} for the film, saying: [...] "I have always loved cars. In one vein, I have Disney blood, and in the other, there's motor oil. The notion of combining these two great passions in my life—cars and animation—was irresistible. When Joe (Ranft) and I first started talking about this film in 1998, we knew we wanted to do something with cars as characters. Around that same time, <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> a documentary called 'Divided Highways,' which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed. That's when we started really researching Route 66, but we still hadn't quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when we visited our family in St. Louis." ...|$|E
500|$|During a {{scene when}} Andy {{describes}} {{his style of}} music, April responds that she completely understands him, although the other characters seemingly do not. That line was improvised by Aubrey Plaza, and later helped inspire the writing staff to place the April and Andy characters into a romantic relationship. Schur said of this, [...] "At the time, it was this little nothing, throwaway thing, but when <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> it, we thought {{there might be something}} there." [...] The scene with Mark making a pass at Ann at the rock show, and Ann's angry reaction to the attempt, were a last-minute addition to the episode. Although Mark and Ann would develop a romantic relationship in the second season, the Parks and Recreation writers had not decided what would happen between the developing romantic plotlines between Leslie and Mark, or Leslie and Ann, at time [...] "Rock Show" [...] aired. In the original pilot script, Mark helped Leslie solely because he was attracted to Ann and felt that green-lighting Leslie's project would give him an excuse {{to spend more time with}} her; the shooting version was retooled to make Leslie less pathetic and Mark less unlikable, by having him won over by Leslie's determination to fight against the odds. Immediately after [...] "Rock Show" [...] was originally broadcast, NBC set up an official website for [...] "Scarecrow Boat", Andy's band featured in the episode. The site, at scarecrowboat.com, included ringtones, band posters, songs for download and photos.|$|E
500|$|Character shading {{supervisor}} on {{the film}} Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges {{on the film}}, saying: [...] "Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film. We started out by learning {{as much as we}} could. At the local body shop, <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> them paint a car, and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that we needed a base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality the might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone." [...] Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: [...] "Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we’ve seen in any of our previous films. In the past, we’ve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for Cars we added a ray-tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar." ...|$|E

500|$|HitFix {{reviewer}} Alan Sepinwall complemented {{the series}} for its cast and music, {{but said that}} he didn't understand the hype towards the series. He also criticized {{the battle for the}} main-role of Marilyn for the musical, writing, [...] "the show keeps trying to position Karen and Ivy as equally-deserving of the part, when Hilty very thoroughly outclasses McPhee whenever the production numbers start." [...] Despite this, he called the pilot, [...] "smart and slick", and that he would keep on watching future episodes. He ultimately gave the episode a B. In a podcast with Sepinwall and fellow HitFix writer Dan Feinberg, the two were very negative towards Jaime Cepero's performance as Ellis Tancharoen, with Sepinwall comparing it to a failed version of [...] "All About Eve". They also criticized the writing for Messing's character, Julia Houston and Hilty's character, Ivy Lynn. Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker praised Messing's performance calling her [...] "funny and charming" [...] and a dialed down version of her Will and Grace character Grace Adler. He later went on to criticize the storyline between McPhee and Hilty, believing that Hilty was [...] "obviously superior" [...] to McPhee and that the storyline felt [...] "strained". He also went on to write that he hoped the series became a ratings success. Tanner Stransky, also of Entertainment Weekly, ranked the pilot episode as the 8th best television episode of 2012 saying, [...] "After <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> the subsequent 14 episodes of Smash with a mixture of fascination and dismay (seriously, did Debra Messing's Julia wear a men's pajama top to meet her lover?), it was difficult to recall that the pilot was positively magical. But it was. In fact, that episode-ending performance of Let Me Be Your Star (featuring dueling divas Megan Hilty and Katharine McPhee) was among TV's most watchable and gleeful three minutes of the year. Rare is the series whose high-water mark is its pilot, and Smash is a shining example." ...|$|E

[...] When describing the role of the 3rd string running back, Jeff Fisher said [...] "The rotation is, for the most part, like it was last year, So the third running back will be called upon if the second back can’t play, and to be a good player on special teams."

Alongside him for the Oxford team, also making their first-class debuts, were Douglas Jardine and R. C. Robertson-Glasgow. In his second match he took 5 for 52 in the second innings against Middlesex. In his third match he took 5 for 48 in Essex's second innings, including a hat-trick. In his fourth match he took seven wickets against Free Foresters, in his fifth, 7 for 47 and 5 for 52 against Somerset, and in his sixth, 8 for 67 and 5 for 61 against Surrey. At this stage Oxford had won five consecutive matches. In the next match, a loss to MCC, he took only three wickets, but it brought his first-class wicket tally to 50 in only his seventh match. He was selected for Gentlemen in both their matches. As well as his cricket Blue in 1920 he also won his Rugby Blue and golf Blue.|$|E
2500|$|Sir Ian McKellen portrayed Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings film series (2001–2003) {{directed}} by Peter Jackson, after Sean Connery and Patrick Stewart both {{turned down the}} role. The make-up and costumes were based on designs by John Howe and Alan Lee. According to Jackson, McKellen based his performance as Gandalf on Tolkien himself:We listened to audio recordings of Tolkien reading excerpts from Lord of the Rings. <b>We</b> <b>watched</b> some BBC interviews with him — there's a few interviews with Tolkien — and Ian based his performance on an impersonation of Tolkien. He's literally basing Gandalf on Tolkien. He sounds the same, he uses the speech patterns and his mannerisms are born {{out of the same}} roughness from the footage of Tolkien. So, Tolkien would recognize himself in Ian's performance. For the first film, McKellen was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.
