25|$|<b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> the {{following}} notation for minors: if A is an m × n matrix, I is {{a subset of}} {1,...,m} with k elements and J is a subset of {1,...,n} with k elements, then we write I,J for the k × k minor of A that corresponds to the rows with index in I and the columns with index in J.|$|E
25|$|When {{manipulating}} linked lists in-place, {{care must}} be taken to not use values that you have invalidated in previous assignments. This makes algorithms for inserting or deleting linked list nodes somewhat subtle. This section gives pseudocode for adding or removing nodes from singly, doubly, and circularly linked lists in-place. Throughout <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> null to refer to an end-of-list marker or sentinel, which may be implemented in a number of ways.|$|E

If needs be we are prepared to walk out of any negotiations that threaten to be another rape of our continent.|$|E

Rael: They will always be secret... because no one on Earth should know the means of protection <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> to welcome them. It is simply a question of security.|$|E
