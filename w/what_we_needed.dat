[...] That's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> to hear." [...] The freedom V2 afforded through its {{hands-off}} approach influenced not only the music, but the album title as well.

Artist Caroline Coon, who was associated with the punk scene, argued that [...] "hose tough, militaristic songs were <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> as we went into Thatcherism".

500|$|In February 1999, Jimmy Eat World {{released}} {{their third}} studio album, Clarity, through Capitol Records. The label started to shelve the album {{until a few}} key radio stations started playing the song [...] "Lucky Denver Mint." [...] After Capitol Records decided not to release their next major-label album, the band left the label. At that time, Jimmy Eat World distributed their albums independently while on tour in Europe. Drummer Zach Lind recalled that the label [...] "really didn’t believe in us. But in a way, {{that was sort of}} a good thing, because it let us take control of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> to do.

500|$|Since A Thousand Leaves was {{the first}} Sonic Youth album that was {{recorded}} in their own studio, the band had more time and freedom to work on it. As a result, the songs evolved unevenly and were recorded from {{an early stage of}} development. According to guitarist Lee Ranaldo, the album is [...] "a reflection of where we were at the time. We weren't into making anything concise. We were just playing what we felt like playing. We really didn't feel like <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> to be doing was producing another record like Goo." [...] The 11-minute song [...] "Hits of Sunshine (For Allen Ginsberg)" [...] was initially intended to be released on one of the EPs as an instrumental track, but it was ultimately included on the album with vocals. The album was co-produced by the band and Confusion Is Sex producer Wharton Tiers and mastered by Greg Calbi at Masterdisk in New York City.|$|E
500|$|The factory {{supervisor}} belatedly {{realizes that}} the gender disparity is impairing morale and productivity, so he arranges for an army officer to organize military maneuvers near the town {{in order for the}} factory to sponsor a big dance, at which the workers can find male companionship among the soldiery. [...] "They need <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> when we were young", he explains to a sympathetic officer. Anticipation runs high on both sides, with the girls expecting to meet the young men of their dreams, while the recruits, many of whom are actually middle-aged reservists, out-of-shape and already married, look forward to a night of revelry and seduction. The night of the party is a disappointment for some members of both groups; Andula and her friends are repulsed by the unappealing soldiers, whom they call [...] "old buffers", and a trio of reservists are so nonplussed by the situation that they commit a series of comic faux pas, like sending a bottle of wine to the wrong table and dropping a wedding ring that one of them is trying to hide, only to watch it roll across the floor and land {{at the feet of the}} young women who are the objects of their lust. [...] For these people, the mixer is a huge flop, with the girls retiring to the lavatory to devise a way to escape their pursuers and the aging reservists arguing with each other over expenses (one points out that [...] "you can only get it [...] free at home") and speculating on the necessity of going to the woods in order to consummate their romantic plans ("Imagine, in this weather!"). For others, however, the dance is a success: the factory supervisor looks on in smug satisfaction as couples throng the crowded dance floor, one girl holds her hands together in a gesture showing her delight and gratitude when she is asked to dance, while an obese, balding soldier capers with a mismatched tall, thin brunette, both clearly having the time of their lives.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} the {{domestic}} dog (Canis lupus familiaris or Canis familiaris) is not clear. Whole genome sequencing indicates that the dog, the gray wolf and the extinct Taymyr wolf diverged at {{around the same time}} 27,000-40,000 years ago. These dates imply that the earliest dogs arose in the time of human hunter-gatherers and not agriculturists. Modern dogs are most closely related to ancient wolf fossils that have been found in Europe than they are to modern gray wolves, with nearly all dog breed's genetic closeness to the gray wolf due to admixture [...] but several Arctic dog breeds with the Taymyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture.

There was no money in that country, and the store took our pelts in exchange for <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> from civilization. Once a month would I load these pelts on the white mare, and make the journey by the path down the creek. At times I met other settlers there, some of them not long from Ireland, with the brogue still in their mouths.

Presently a little barefooted colored boy came along, whose raggedness was conspicuously not Bermudian. His rear was so marvelously bepatched with colored squares and triangles that one was half persuaded he had got it out of an atlas. When the sun struck him right, he was as good to follow as a lightning-bug. We hired him and dropped into his wake. He piloted us through one picturesque street after another, and in due course deposited us where we belonged. He charged nothing for his map, and but a trifle for his services: so the Reverend doubled it. The little chap received the money with a beaming applause in his eye which plainly said, [...] "This man's an onion!" ...|$|E
