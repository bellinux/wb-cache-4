5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS) {{as one of}} the autism spectrum disorders (ASD) or pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), {{which are}} a spectrum of psychological conditions that are characterized by abnormalities of social interaction and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as social deficits. Of the other four ASD forms, autism is the most similar to AS in signs and likely causes, but its diagnosis requires impaired communication and allows delay in cognitive development; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes; and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is diagnosed when the criteria for a more specific disorder are unmet.|$|E

Test anxiety applies to standardized tests as well, where students <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> test anxiety regularly feel immense pressure to perform when {{the stakes are}} so high. High stakes standardized testing includes exams like the SAT, the PARCC, and the ACT, where doing well is required for grade passing or college admission.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Department of State charges back fees to {{manufacturers}} {{who have}} failed to register previously. Smaller exporters <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{been aware of the}} requirement to register can potentially be charged crippling back fees when they first register. Allegations have been put to the U.S. Department of State-industry advisory group, the Defense Trade Advisory Group, that charging back fees discourages some manufacturers from registration.|$|E
25|$|Finally {{published}} in 1980, the DSM-III was 494 pages and listed 265 diagnostic categories. It rapidly came into widespread international use {{and has been}} termed a revolution or transformation in psychiatry. However, Robert Spitzer later criticized his own work on it {{in an interview with}} Adam Curtis, saying it led to the medicalization of 20-30 percent of the population <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> had any serious mental problems.|$|E
25|$|Printed {{texts and}} {{pamphlets}} {{were available to}} {{a large number of}} literate people, at a relatively affordable price. Furthermore, the ideas and beliefs of the reform writers, including Martin Luther, were also widely disseminated orally to large numbers of illiterate people <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been involved with the Reformation otherwise. The Roman Catholic propagandists also utilized this method of propaganda within the church but it was not as effective as the Protestant propagandists.|$|E

25|$|The {{distribution}} of benefits from adaptation and mitigation policies {{are different in}} terms of damages avoided (Toth et al., 2001:653). Adaptation activities mainly benefit those who implement them, while mitigation benefits others <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> made mitigation investments. Mitigation can therefore {{be viewed as a}} global public good, while adaptation is either a private good in the case of autonomous adaptation, or a national or regional public good in the case of public sector policies.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{symptoms}} {{may include}} inflammatory {{involvement of the}} perirectal or perianal lymphatic tissues. In females, cervicitis, perimetritis, or salpingitis may occur as well as lymphangitis and lymphadenitis in deeper nodes. Because of lymphatic drainage pathways, some patients develop an abdominal mass which seldom suppurates, and 20â€“30% develop inguinal lymphadenopathy. Systemic signs which can appear include fever, decreased appetite, and malaise. Diagnosis is more difficult in {{women and men who}} have sex with men (MSM) <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the inguinal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|During development, Kojima Productions and Konami {{attracted}} {{criticism for}} {{their decision to}} include microtransactions; a system that allows players to pay for access to content in the game. However, a spokesperson for Kojima Productions confirmed that the system was included to benefit players <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the time to complete the game, given its scale, and that no content would be available exclusively through microtransactions. Further controversy emerged following the publication of an early review claiming that the Forward Operating Base mode was behind a paywall, which Konami refuted saying that microtransactions acted as an accelerator rather than a paywall.|$|E

25|$|Yorkshire had {{a policy}} of not {{offering}} contracts to its players, but in return they would tell cricketers {{by the end of}} July if they did not require their services the next summer. When July 1970 came and went, Close must have thought he was safe. However, Close offended the Lancashire president, the Honourable Lionel Lister, when Lister entered the away captain's changing room to speak to Close after Lancashire, Yorkshire's archrivals, had beaten them at Old Trafford to retain the one-day John Player League trophy. Close, <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> known who Lister was, offered Lister some choice words. Lister immediately told Brian Sellers, the chairman of the Yorkshire cricket committee, of the insult.|$|E
25|$|The {{stature of}} the Soviet Union, with its ostensibly 'anti-colonialist' ideology, was {{enhanced}} by its {{position as a}} primary victor in the war. Its doctrines demanded a harsh judgment on the French in North Africa. In this vien continued writers <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been communists. During the French presence, the maghriban resistance was articulated in sharper and more combative terms as the independence movements intensified. Especially bitter in accusation was {{the works of the}} iconic, anti-colonial writer of Algeria, Frantz Fanon. The United States of America, the other major victor and power following the war, also articulated a stance against the continued existence of colonies, despite remaining in alliance with European colonial states. Yet within several years of the war's end, Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt had become independent, as had India and Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Burma, Indonesia, and the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{format for}} {{contemporary}} Let's Play videos is vague, {{and at times}} may be compared or considered {{the same as a}} player completing a game via streaming video for an audience. According to Patrick Lee of The A.V. Club, a good Let's Play video distinguishes itself from straightforward streaming playthroughs when the player has sufficiently familiarized themselves with the game as to be able to offer better commentary and show off more of the game to their audience, is able to provide the audience with personal recollections about the game, or can play through a game they have already completed under self-imposed challenges, such as completing a game without killing any enemy. Through this approach, Lee states, such Let's Play videos serve to help memorialize these games, helping those <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> access to the titles (due to age or regional restrictions) to appreciate more obscure games.|$|E

25|$|When {{performing}} the Dixâ€“Hallpike test, patients are lowered quickly to a supine position, with the neck extended by the clinician {{performing the}} maneuver. For some patients, this maneuver {{may not be}} indicated, and a modification may be needed that also targets the posterior semicircular canal. Such patients include those who are too anxious about eliciting the uncomfortable symptoms of vertigo, and those <b>who</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the range of motion necessary to comfortably be in a supine position. The modification involves the patient moving from a seated position to side-lying without their head extending off the examination table, such as with Dixâ€“Hallpike. The head is rotated 45 degrees away from the side being tested, and the eyes are examined for nystagmus. A positive test is indicated by patient report of a reproduction of vertigo and clinician observation of nystagmus. Both the Dixâ€“Hallpike and the side-lying testing position have yielded similar results, and as such the side-lying position can be used if the Dixâ€“Hallpike cannot be performed easily.|$|E

500|$|While {{the fort}} itself was never {{endangered}} by the British assault, Ticonderoga became a byword for impregnability.

In 1777, when General John Burgoyne advanced down Lake Champlain {{at the beginning of the}} Saratoga campaign, General George Washington, who had never seen the fort, thought highly of its defensive value. Anthony Wayne, who was at Fort Ticonderoga preparing its defenses before Burgoyne's arrival, wrote to Washington that the fort [...] "can never be carried, without much loss of blood". Fort Ticonderoga was surrendered by the Americans without much of a fight in July 1777.|$|E
