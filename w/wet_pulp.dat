50|$|To {{enhance the}} paper's strength, {{cationic}} starch {{is added to}} <b>wet</b> <b>pulp</b> in the manufacturing process. Starch has a similar chemical structure as the cellulose fibre of the pulp, and the surface of both the starch and fibre are negatively charged. By adding cationic (positive charged) starch, the fibre can bind with the starch and thus also increase the interconnections between the fibres. The positively charged portion of the starch is usually formed by quaternary ammonium cations. Quaternary salts that are used include 2.3-epoxy propyl trimethyl ammoniumchloride (EPTAC, also known as or Glytac Quab, GMAC™) and (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl) trimethyl ammonium chloride (CHPTAC, also known as Quat 188, Quab 188, Reagens™).|$|E

40|$|Hematologic {{parameters}} {{are used as}} an auxiliary method for evaluation and diagnosis of various diseases, such as parasitic infections. Citrus pulp has essential oils in its composition that may combat parasitism. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the hematological parameters of animals supplemented with dried citrus <b>pulp</b> or <b>wet</b> citrus <b>pulp</b> silage. The experiment was carried out at Institute of Animal Science (Instituto de Zootecnia-APTA-SAA-SP), from June to August 2012. Twenty-four Santa Inês ewes lambs, with initial live weight around 25 kg, were totally dewormed and, after three negative fecal EPG (egg per gram) determination, were artificially infected with 3500 larvae of Haemonchus contortus. After 21 days, EPG was performed and the animals divided into three uniform groups of 8 animals / treatments according to theirs live weight and fecal EPG. The animals were placed in individual suspended slatted floor pens for 42 days and fed with corn silage and supplemented with 1 % (on DM basis) of corn grain (T 1 - control) or dried citrus pulp (T 2) or <b>wet</b> citrus <b>pulp</b> silage (T 3). Diets were kept isoproteic (11 % CP) by supplementation with soybean meal. Blood samples were taken every 14 days for analysis of packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin (Hb) and erythrocyte count (Ery). Analysis of variance was performed with transformations of data (log X + 10) and the means compared by Tukey test at 5 % probability by SAS. The mean Hb and Ery were 9. 8 ± 1. 55, 10. 49 ± 1. 40 (T 1), 9. 03 ± 1. 49, 9. 78 ± 1. 60 (T 2) and 9 55 ± 1. 22, 10. 02 ± 1. 22 (T 3), statistically similar (P> 0. 05) and are within the normal range for the species. In relation to PCV, the control group (29. 50 ± 3. 89) was higher (P 0. 05) to the other two treatments.

Packed cell volume (PCV) is a tool for indirect diagnosis of infections caused by Haemonchus contortus, since this parasite is a haematophagous nematode that causes severe anemia in animals. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the results of PCV and fecal egg count per gram of feces (EPG) in sheep naturally infected fed with dried citrus <b>pulp</b> or <b>wet</b> citrus <b>pulp</b> silage. The experiment was carried out at Instituto de Zootecnia, from June to august/ 2012, with 45 Santa Ines ewe lambs divided into three groups (15 animals / treatment), according to weight and initial EPG.

Aruana grass and supplemented with corn silage and with 1 % (DM basis) of corn grain (T 1 - control) or dried citrus pulp (T 2) or <b>wet</b> citrus <b>pulp</b> silage (T 3). Blood and feces samples were collected for packed cell volume determination by centrifugation and feces by examination in McMaster chambers. Analysis of variance was performed after data transformations (log (X+ 10)) and means compared by the SNK test at 5 % probability (SAS). The means of group 1, 2 and 3 did not show statistic difference (P> 0. 05) on PCV : 25. 92 ± 3. 94 %, 26. 95 ± 04. 01 % and 27. 47 ± 5. 32 %, respectively, however, the value 25. 92 % PCV on the T 1 is lower than the reference value for sheep. Regarding the EPG, the ewe lambs of T 1 had the highest mean (P < 0. 05) for trichostrongylides (2051 ± 3747) compared with the two others treatments (T 2 : 1485 ± 2031) and T 3 (2151 ± 4509) that were similar between them. In contrast, the mean for Strongyloides spp. counts were higher in T 3 (295 ± 664 - P < 0. 05), whereas T 1 (45. 7 ± 104. 8) were similar to T 2 (72. 2 ± 132. 6).

A decanter centrifuge was employed during the experimental tests with variable differential speed between bowl and screw conveyor (Dn) and with regulation capability of oil-pulp ring levels. Thus permit to shift from three to two phase, reducing water added and discharging the following by-products: dehydrated husk similar to that of three-phase and recovers a <b>wet</b> <b>pulp</b> that is the between the liquid phase and the solid phase. This paper aims to report the preliminary results of the energy and functional efficiency of the decanter when it works in the industrial scale plant and using a continuous method. The trials were carried out at two different flow rate values; for each flow rate the different variable differential speed between bowl and screw conveyor was varied at 15, 50, 17, 50 and 19, 50. Quality olive, operating speed of the crusher machine and relative feed flow rate of the machine, the malaxing time and the degree of dilution of the paste, as well as the oil-pulp ring level were the same for all the trials. Irrespective of the flow rate and Dn used, the machine tends to stabilize energy consumption {{in a very short time}} and values were quite similar to each other. The reductions in flow rate do not involve reductions of energy consumption indeed lead to the increase of absorption per unit mass of product worked.

40|$|Introduction Ensiling {{is one of}} {{the common}} {{preserving}} methods for forage or other organic materials. In this method, organic matters were preserved by proving an aerobic condition and then by reducing the pH with increasing acids production (mainly lactic acid). Some circumstances like enough soluble carbohydrates, low buffering capacity and appropriate dry matter concentration are needed in ensilages for an ideal silage production. Seepage production during ensiling {{is one of the}} most problems especially when high moisture materials (like fresh beet sugar pulp) are ensiled. Silage seepage can pollute the environment and make loses in nutrients like soluble carbohydrates, protein, organic acids and etc. Moreover, lactic acid bacteria inoculants (Mainly consist of Lactobacillus plantarum) have been widely used for improving fermentation pattern in ensilages. These external provided bacteria usually enhance lactic acid production in silage and then accelerate the falling of pH values in silages. Rapid decrease in pH can inhibit non-beneficial bacteria from activity which finally preserves nutrients from un-necessary fermentation or oxidation. The aim of this study was to investigate the interactive effects of lactic acid bacteria inoculants and some absorbents (straw and pith) on chemical properties and fermentation profile of <b>wet</b> sugar beet <b>pulp</b> silage.
