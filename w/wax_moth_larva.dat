40|$|Objectives - To {{investigate}} whether the <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> <b>larva,</b> Galleria mellonella, is a suitable host {{for assessing the}} in vivo efficacy of antistaphylococcal agents against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections. Methods - Wax moth larvae were infected with increasing doses of S. aureus to investigate the effect of inoculum size on larval survival. In addition, infected wax moth larvae were treated with daptomycin, penicillin or vancomycin to examine whether these agents were effective against S. aureus and MRSA infections in vivo. Results - Increasing inoculum doses of live S. aureus cells resulted in greater larval mortality, but heat-killed bacteria and cell-free culture filtrates had no detrimental effects on survival. Larval mortality rate also depended on the post-inoculation incubation temperature. After larvae were infected with S. aureus, larval survival was enhanced by administering the antistaphylococcal antibiotics daptomycin or vancomycin. Larval survival increased with increasing doses of the antibiotics. Moreover, penicillin improved survival of larvae infected with a penicillin-susceptible methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strain, but it was ineffective at similar doses in larvae infected with MRSA (penicillin resistant). Daptomycin and vancomycin were also effective when administered to the larvae prior to infection with bacteria. Conclusions - This is the first report to demonstrate that antibiotics are effective in the <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> <b>larva</b> model {{for the treatment of}} infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. The new <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> <b>larva</b> model is a useful preliminary model for assessing the in vivo efficacy of candidate antistaphylococcal agents before proceeding to mammalian studies, which may reduce animal experimentation and expense...|$|E

40|$|There is {{an urgent}} need for new {{antimicrobial}} agents to combat infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens. Once a compound is shown {{to be effective in}} vitro, it is necessary to evaluate its efficacy in an animal infection model. Typically, this is achieved using a mammalian model, but such experiments are costly, time consuming, and require full ethical consideration. Hence, cheaper and ethically more acceptable invertebrate models of infection have been introduced, including the larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella. Invertebrates have an immune system that is functionally similar to the innate immune system of mammals, and often identical virulence and pathogenicity factors are used by human pathogenic microbes to infect wax moth larvae and mammals. Moreover, the virulence of many human pathogens is comparable in wax moth larvae and mammals. Using key examples from the literature, this chapter highlights the benefits of using the <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> <b>larva</b> model to provide a rapid, inexpensive, and reliable evaluation of the toxicity and efficacy of new antimicrobial agents in vivo and prior to the use of more expensive mammalian models. This simple insect model can bridge the gap between in vitro studies and mammalian experimentation by screening out compounds with a low likelihood of success, while providing greater justification for further studies in mammalian systems. Thus, broader implementation of the <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> <b>larva</b> model into anti- infective drug discovery and development programs could reduce the use of mammals during preclinical assessments and the overall cost of drug development...|$|E

40|$|The {{virulence}} {{and fitness}} in vivo {{of the major}} human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus {{are associated with a}} cell-to-cell signaling mechanism known as quorum sensing (QS). QS coordinates the production of virulence factors via the production and sensing of autoinducing peptide (AIP) signal molecules by the agr locus. Here we show, in a <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> <b>larva</b> virulence model, that (i) QS in S. aureus is a cooperative social trait that provides a benefit to the local population of cells, (ii) agr mutants, which do not pro- duce or respond to QS signal, are able to exploit the benefits provided by the QS of others (“cheat”), allowing them to increase in frequency when in mixed populations with cooperators, (iii) these social interactions between cells determine virulence, with the host mortality rate being negatively correlated to the percentage of agr mutants (“cheats”) in a population, and (iv) a higher within-host relatedness (lower strain diversity) selects for QS and hence higher virulence. Our results provide an explanation for why agr mutants show reduced virulence in animal models but can be isolated from infections of humans. More generally, by providing the first evidence that QS is a cooperative social behavior in a Gram-positive bacterium, our results suggest conver- gent, and potentially widespread, evolution for signaling to coordinate cooperation in bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Honeybees secrete 2 -heptanone (2 -H) {{from their}} mandibular glands when they bite. Researchers have {{identified}} several possible functions: 2 -H could {{act as an}} alarm pheromone to recruit guards and soldiers, it could act as a chemical marker, or it could have some other function. The actual role of 2 -H in honeybee behaviour remains unresolved. In this study, we show that 2 -H acts as an anaesthetic in small arthropods, such as <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> <b>larva</b> (WML) and Varroa mites, which are paralysed after a honeybee bite. We demonstrated that honeybee mandibles can penetrate the cuticle of WML, introducing less than one nanolitre of 2 -H into the WML open circulatory system and causing instantaneous anaesthetization that lasts for a few minutes. The first indication that 2 -H acts as a local anaesthetic was that its effect on larval response, inhibition and recovery {{is very similar to}} that of lidocaine. We compared the inhibitory effects of 2 -H and lidocaine on voltage-gated sodium channels. Although both compounds blocked the hNav 1. 6 and hNav 1. 2 channels, lidocaine was slightly more effective, 2. 82 times, on hNav. 6. In contrast, when the two compounds were tested using an ex vivo preparation–the isolated rat sciatic nerve–the function of the two compounds was so similar {{that we were able to}} definitively classify 2 -H as a local anaesthetic.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether combinations of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with caspofungin display enhanced antifungal activity versus Candida albicans in vitro and in vivo. Three conventional AMPs that satisfied criteria favouring their potential development as novel antifungals were selected for investigation. Colistin sulphate was also included as a cyclic peptide antibiotic used in the clinic. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for each antifungal agent and checkerboard assays were used to determine fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values for dual combinations of AMPs or colistin with caspofungin. Viability assays were performed for the same combinations in order to investigate fungicidal interactions. Synergistic antifungal combinations were then tested for efficacy in vivo and compared to monotherapies in <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> <b>larva</b> and murine models of systemic C. albicans infection. In combination with caspofungin, each of the AMPs [hMUC 7 - 12, DsS 3 (1 - 16), hLF(1 - 11) ] and colistin were synergistic and candidacidal in vitro. The treatment of infected wax moth larvae with combinations of caspofungin with hMUC 7 - 12, DsS 3 (1 - 16) or colistin resulted in significant enhancements in survival compared to treatment with monotherapies. Notably, the treatment of C. albicans-infected mice with a combination of caspofungin and DsS 3 (1 - 16) resulted in the enhancement of survival compared to groups treated with just the individual agents. This study demonstrates that combination therapies containing caspofungin and AMPs or colistin merit further development as potential novel treatments for C. albicans infections...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococci are {{associated}} with both humans and animals. While most are non-pathogenic colonizers, Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen capable of causing severe infections. S. aureus virulence {{is controlled by the}} agr quorum sensing system responding to secreted auto-inducing peptides (AIPs) sensed by AgrC, a two component histidine kinase. agr loci are found also in other staphylococcal species and for Staphylococcus epidermidis, the encoded AIP represses expression of agr regulated virulence genes in S. aureus. In this study we aimed to better understand the interaction between staphylococci and S. aureus, and show that this interaction may eventually lead to the identification of new anti-virulence candidates to target S. aureus infections. Here we show that culture supernatants of 37 out of 52 staphylococcal isolates representing 17 different species inhibit S. aureus agr. The dog pathogen, Staphylococcus schleiferi, expressed the most potent inhibitory activity and was active against all four agr classes found in S. aureus. By employing a S. aureus strain encoding a constitutively active AIP receptor we show that the activity is mediated via agr. Subsequent cloning and heterologous expression of the S. schleiferi AIP in S. aureus demonstrated that this molecule was likely responsible for the inhibitory activity, and further proof was provided when pure synthetic S. schleiferi AIP was able to completely abolish agr induction of an S. aureus reporter strain. To assess impact on S. aureus virulence, we co-inoculated S. aureus and S. schleiferi in vivo in the Galleria mellonella <b>wax</b> <b>moth</b> <b>larva,</b> and found that expression of key S. aureus virulence factors was abrogated. Our data show that the S. aureus agr locus is highly responsive to other staphylococcal species suggesting that agr is an inter-species communication system. Based on these results we speculate that interactions between S. aureus and other colonizing staphylococci will significantly influence the ability of S. aureus to cause infection, and we propose that other staphylococci are potential sources of compounds that can be applied as anti-virulence therapy for combating S. aureus infections...|$|E

The ammonium sulfate precipitate in 60 - 70 % was very reproducible. The enzyme showed the greatest instability after 70 % ammonium sulfate precipitation; this made further purification difficult. The acetone powder solution was found to be stable at room temperature for about 2 hours. The pH optimum of esterases was found to be close to 8. 0.
