6000|$|Carvil (Viciously). Yes, I {{will sit}} out. (Insistent.) But {{what can be}} your game? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to?</b> (They pass through garden gate.) Because if it's his money you are after------- ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} watched her a moment. [...] "How you DO like to tuck us {{in and then}} sit up yourself! What {{do you want to}} do, anyway? <b>What</b> <b>ARE</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to,</b> mummy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Cosmopolites always do. Now {{answer my}} questions. <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to?' and Dare {{as he spoke}} played with the pistol again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--Merrett--I won. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to--writing lines? <b>You</b> {{may as well}} save {{yourself}} the trouble. They won't be any good." [...] Dunstable stared.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come!' said Fledgeby. 'I won't {{press that}} just now. But I {{want to know}} this, and I will know this, mind <b>you.</b> <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, what's {{got into}} the deacon's folks lately," [...] said Silence, [...] "to have company so often? Joe Adams, this 'ere is some 'cut up' of yours. Come, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Halloa! <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to,</b> my dear?' said Mr Codlin, {{raising his}} head, and yawning. Then observing that his {{companion}} was fast asleep, he added in an earnest whisper, 'Codlin's the friend, remember--not Short.' ...|$|E
60|$|MRS WARREN [on {{the alert}} at once] Now see here, George: <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> about that girl? I've been {{watching}} {{your way of}} looking at her. Remember: I know you and what your looks mean.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nat Poole, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to!" [...] cried Dave, indignantly, and, leaping forward, {{he caught}} the other youth by the {{shoulder}} and whirled him around. [...] "You let Professor Potts alone!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hi! hi! <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to?" [...] cried Ralph, as {{he dropped}} the bar, and rushed {{over to the side}} of the bridge. [...] "Do you want to run into the stonework?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{went in with}} {{my light}} and found him, in bed, very wide awake, but very much at his ease. [...] "Well, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>up</b> to?" [...] he asked with a grace of {{sociability}} in which {{it occurred to me}} that Mrs. Grose, had she been present, might have looked in vain for proof that anything was [...] "out." ...|$|R
6000|$|FRANK. He's rector here. I'm {{living with}} my people this autumn {{for the sake}} of economy. Things came to a crisis in July: the Roman father had to pay my debts. He's stony broke in consequence; and so am I. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> in these parts? do you know the people here? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've just {{finished}} the Hillyard case {{and they gave}} me a vacation. So I came here to see my little girl. I didn't know she was being neglected, Josie. I shall take better care of her after this. My visit to Cragg's Crossing is perfectly natural, for I was born here. But you? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to,</b> Josie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anne, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to?</b> There's {{something}} going on that I don't understand. The whole air here tonight {{has been charged with}} electricity. Leslie sits like the muse of tragedy; Owen Ford jokes and laughs on the surface, and watches Leslie with the eyes of his soul. You seem all the time to be bursting with some suppressed excitement. Own up. What secret have you been keeping from your deceived husband?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Vincent!" [...] Mrs. Wingfield exclaimed, {{starting}} up, [...] "what {{has happened}} to <b>you?</b> <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> dressed <b>up</b> like that for? Is anything the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Ingleby laughed drowsily and {{stretched}} his aching limbs. [...] "I really believe I am, though I scarcely felt it until this moment. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> sitting <b>up</b> for, Hetty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The boys {{took the}} little silver plates from their pockets {{and handed them}} silently to Captain Manley, who read aloud, to the {{surprise}} of those around him,--"'To Tom' and 'Peter,' they are alike except the names. 'To Tom Scudamore, presented by the passengers in the Highflyer coach on the 4th of August, 1808, as a testimony of their appreciation of his gallant conduct, by which their property was saved from plunder.' Why, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> this, <b>you</b> young pickles, <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> to on the 4th of August last year?" ...|$|R
6000|$|In fact, Mr Fledgeby sped on his errand {{of mercy}} through the streets, at so brisk {{a rate that}} his feet might have been winged by all the good spirits that wait on Generosity. They might have taken up their station in his breast, too, for he was blithe and merry. There was quite a fresh trill in his voice, when, {{arriving}} at the counting-house in St Mary Axe, and finding it for the moment empty, he trolled forth {{at the foot of}} the staircase: 'Now, Judah, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> there?' ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was clear}} to me that after that I must as people say [...] "have things out" [...] with Rachel. But before I could do {{anything}} of the sort the Fürstin pounced upon me. She made me sit up that night after her other guests had gone to their rooms, in the cosy little turret apartment she called her study and devoted to the reading of whatever was most notorious in contemporary British fiction. [...] "Sit down," [...] said she, [...] "by the fire in that chair there and tell me all about it. It's no good your pretending you don't know what I mean. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> with her, and why don't you go straight to your manifest destiny as a decent man should?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The drawing-room at Knight Sutton Hall was in {{that state}} of bustle {{incidental}} to the expectation of company, which was sure to prevail wherever Mrs. Langford reigned. She walked about, removing the covers from chairs and ottomans, shaking out curtains, adjusting china, and appealing to Mrs. Frederick Langford in various matters of taste, though never allowing her to move to assist her. Henrietta, however, often came to her help, and was certainly acting {{in a way to}} incur the severe displeasure of the absent queen, by laying aside Midas's robes to assist in the arrangements. [...] "That picture is crooked, I am sure!" [...] said Mrs. Langford; and of course she was not satisfied till she had summoned Geoffrey from the study to give his opinion, and had made him mount upon a chair to settle its position. In the midst of the operation, in walked Uncle Roger. [...] "Hollo! Geoffrey, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> now? So, ma'am, you are making yourself smart to-day. Where is my father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, tranquilly, [...] "I {{contrive}} {{to pay my}} debts as {{the usual}} thing, but we'll let that slide. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> at <b>up</b> here in the bush?" ...|$|R
6000|$|His face {{remained}} expressionless. [...] "I don't believe it. Can such maidens {{come out}} of Roaring Fork--nit! But I don't mean that. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> doing <b>up</b> here in this wilderness?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello yourself, Tommy Tit!" [...] shouted Peter joyously. [...] "My, my, my, but I {{am glad to}} see <b>you!</b> But <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> doing <b>up</b> here in the Old Pasture yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Since {{he entered}} the cabin Hassim had been {{watching}} him in thoughtful and expectant silence. [...] "I can't have it," [...] he continued with genuine feeling in his voice. [...] "Damme! I've too much respect for myself." [...] He rose with heavy deliberation; his eyes bulged out in a severe and dignified stare. [...] "Out you go!" [...] he bellowed; suddenly, making a step forward.--"Great Scott! <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to,</b> mister?" [...] asked {{in a tone of}} dispassionate surprise the steward whose head appeared in the doorway. [...] "These are the Captain's friends." [...] "Show me a man's friends and [...] ." [...] began Shaw, dogmatically, but abruptly passed into the tone of admonition. [...] "You take your mug out of the way, bottle-washer. They ain't friends of mine. I ain't a vagabond. I know what's due to myself. Quit!" [...] he hissed, fiercely. Hassim, with an alert movement, grasped the handle of his kris. Shaw puffed out his cheeks and frowned.--"Look out! He will stick you like a prize pig," [...] murmured Carter without moving a muscle. Shaw looked round helplessly.--"And you would enjoy the fun--wouldn't you?" [...] he said with slow bitterness. Carter's distant non-committal smile quite overwhelmed him by its horrid frigidity. Extreme despondency replaced the proper feeling of racial pride in the primitive soul of the mate. [...] "My God! What luck! What have I done to fall amongst that lot?" [...] he groaned, sat down, and took his big grey head in his hands. Carter drew aside to make room for Immada, who, in obedience to a whisper from her brother, sought to leave the cabin. She passed out after an instant of hesitation, during which she looked up at Carter once. Her brother, motionless in a defensive attitude, protected her retreat. She disappeared; Hassim's grip on his weapon relaxed; he looked in turn at every object in the cabin as if to fix its position in his mind forever, and following his sister, walked out with noiseless footfalls.|$|E
40|$|Interviewer: Is there {{anything}} else {{you would like to}} add to your life story, more specific situations that might occur, via Messenger, related to harassment, or to gender violence? Sonia: I heard, I don’t know if it was on the news or some-thing, but I found out that quite a few videos were coming out on the Internet and so on, on YouTube and all of those websites, which were of guys who had just met girls and who said to them: “put your webcam on messenger ” and then they said “now show me one of your boobs, ” and if the girl said yes, he would film it and then put it on the Internet.

40|$|Hey, Bill! How are {{you doing}} lately? I haven’t seen you in the pub for a while now. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> these days? You said a while back {{that you were going}} to put {{together}} a paper about for submission. How is that going? ” Phil asked when he saw his friend Bill, who is pursuing grad studies in the field of biology. “It’s going all right, I guess. There’re a few experiments that I still need to repeat to get better blots, but I just finished the draft for the paper in the lab so I headed straight here for some cold refreshment. How about you? How goes your philosophy research? ” Bill replied. “Same-old stuff. I’m going to do some TAing this year to satisfy my Ph. D. requirement in philosophy. Hey, is that your draft there? Mind if I read it?...|$|E
5000|$|... "It's saying, {{stand up}} to rock stars. That's about {{choosing}} your enemies, too. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> gonna stand <b>up</b> for and <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> gonna stand <b>up</b> against? I love the notion of standing up to rock stars. Because they {{are a bunch of}} fucking megalomaniacs." [...] —Bono on the lyrical meaning behind [...] "Stand Up Comedy".|$|R
6000|$|... "Hi there! <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> fellows <b>up</b> to?" [...] came {{suddenly}} from Packard Brown, who {{had happened}} to look behind him. [...] "See, Jarvey, those two fellows have cast our boat adrift!" ...|$|R
6000|$|GIUSEPPE (piteously, as {{he places}} {{the light on}} the table). Excellency: <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>you</b> looking <b>up</b> at just now--out there? (He points across his {{shoulder}} to the vineyard, but is afraid to look round.) ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Flynn pondered. [...] "Tell my landlady in {{the morning}} that I’ve took your back room," [...] he said. [...] "What a fortunit thing it is I’m out o’ work. <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> walking <b>up</b> and down like that for, Bill? Back coming on agin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Sam!" [...] said Psmith cordially, [...] "this is well met! I {{remember}} you. Yes, indeed, I do. Wasn't you the feller {{with the}} open umbereller that I met one rainy {{morning on the}} Av-en-ue? <b>What,</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> coming <b>up?</b> Sam, I hate to do it, but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Sam!" [...] he said cordially, [...] "this is great. Now for our {{interesting}} experiment. My idea <b>is</b> that <b>you</b> {{can hurt}} a coon's {{head with a}} stick if you hit it hard enough. Keep quite still. Now. <b>What,</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> coming <b>up?</b> Sam, I hate to do it, but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> {{bringing}} that <b>up</b> here for?" [...] he asked. [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> diving; for I see your clothes are dripping with water?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! I see now <b>what</b> it <b>was</b> <b>you</b> gave <b>up</b> your {{precious}} ring for. I perceived {{you had some}} cunning plan to give me pleasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|JULIA. Is it, indeed, too bad? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> doing <b>up</b> {{here with}} that woman? You scoundrel!
