5|$|In Baby Face Stanwyck {{moves to}} New York and sleeps her <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> Gotham Trust. Her {{progress}} {{is illustrated in}} a recurring visual metaphor of the movie camera panning ever upward along the front of Gotham Trust's skyscraper. Men are driven mad with lust over her and they commit murder, attempt suicide, and are ruined financially for associating with her before she mends her ways in the final reel. In another departure from post Code films, Stanwyck's sole companion {{for the duration of}} the picture is a black woman named Chico (Theresa Harris), whom she took with her when she ran away from home at age 14.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{has been}} a more {{successful}} industry in the area. For over two hundred years visitors have been drawn by the lake and mountain scenery of the Lake District, and many have made their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> Helvellyn. Among the early visitors to Helvellyn were the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth, both of whom lived nearby at one period. Many routes up the mountain are possible so {{that it may be}} approached from all directions. The view from the top {{is one of the most}} extensive over the Lake District, and on a clear day the view can also stretch from Scotland to Wales.|$|E
5|$|One day, {{following}} {{a flash of}} light, the stone {{at the base of}} the Mana Tree cracks, distorting time and space. The hero recalls that their friend Tess, who is a priestess, went to the Mana Tower to pray, and goes to find her. After reaching the tower with an Elemental in tow, the hero finds the tower is infested with monsters. Upon fighting their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the tower, the hero finds Tess, frightened but unharmed. Suddenly, a giant flaming bird descends upon the two. The hero attempts to fight it, but finds that the bird is protected by a barrier. A sword then falls from the sky, causing the bird's shield to fade away and allowing the hero to slay the beast. When the bird is defeated, a mysterious man garbed in black appears and attempts to take the Holy Sword, which is still stuck in the ground, but is prevented by the appearance of a barrier when he tries. The man disappears, and the hero attempts to grab the sword. No barrier appears to prevent them, and they take what turns out to be the fabled Sword of Mana.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} season he made 33 league appearances, scoring 20 goals. After only one full season, his bravery and skill {{attracted the attention}} of Arsenal's Herbert Chapman, who tried to persuade Drake to move to north London. Drake rejected the chance of a move to Highbury and decided to remain at The Dell. He started the 1933–34 season by scoring a hat-trick in the opening game against Bradford City, following this with at least one goal in the next four games, thereby amassing eight goals in the opening five games. By early March he had blasted his <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the Football League Division Two goal-scoring table with 22 goals.|$|E
25|$|The Lemmen-Holton Cancer Pavilion was {{developed}} to bring all cancer research and patient service delivery in the Spectrum Health System under one roof. The land for the project was purchased in 2002 with a donation from Fred and Lena Meijer. The $78 million facility opened on June 30, 2008. It is located {{across the street from}} Butterworth Hospital on Michigan Street and is connected to it by an underground tunnel. Since the location is also near the VAI, the hospital has a high rate of cancer patients on clinical trials: eight percent compared to the national rate of three percent. The Pavilion is named after two employees that worked for Meijer and advanced their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the company.|$|E

25|$|In all, {{there were}} four hotels along the line, but {{the extent of the}} construction, and the poor {{patronage}} had stretched Lowe to his limit. By 1898 the railroad fell into receivership under Jared Sidney Torrance, founder of Torrance, California. Both men applied to the government for rights of <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> Mt. Lowe. The government realized that the whole railroad was on Federal property (vis-à-vis the San Gabriel Timberland Reserve) and demanded that a proper lease be taken out on the properties. Having reviewed Lowe's standing with the railway, Congress awarded the receivership to Torrance in 1899, and Lowe was left with only the title to the observatory. It was at this time that the railway was reorganized and incorporated as the Mount Lowe Railway. The railway was sold at auction to a Mr. Valentine Peyton of Danville, Illinois, who personally came to California to run the operation.|$|E
25|$|After the tour, England {{returned}} home to play Bangladesh with Strauss's home ground of Lord's only helping him towards a half century in the one innings they played. In the following NatWest Series against Bangladesh and Australia, England built on their momentum going into the Ashes series by making their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the group and into the final. Individually, Strauss posted 82* and 98 {{in the first and}} last matches against Bangladesh, with a One Day high score of 152 from 128 balls in the middle match but fared less well against Australia, never scoring more than 25 and only managing 2 in the tied final at Lord's. Strauss was significantly shuffled down the order in England's inaugural Twenty20 International against Australia and made 18 in their 100 run win and in the losing NatWest Challenge scored favourably, but not notable, with two scores near 50.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} two Dauer 962 Le Mans racing cars were built. Arriving at Le Mans {{with the support}} of Porsche's factory racing team, Joest Racing, Dauer's two cars showed that they lacked the overall pace of the top Group C cars by {{qualifying}} fifth and seventh. However their pace in their class was shattering as the next closest GT1-class car could only muster 12th. The race saw Porsche's plan pan out, as the Dauer 962 Le Mans were able to gradually make their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the standings while their competitors spent time in the pits or succumbed to mechanical woes. In the end, only a lone Toyota 94C-V in the Group C class could contend with the Dauers, taking second place overall. The Dauer 962 Le Mans of Yannick Dalmas, Hurley Haywood, and Mauro Baldi would take the overall win while the second team car would finish one lap behind in third place overall.|$|E

25|$|In the Battle of the Bidassoa on 7 October 1813, Taupin's 4,700-man {{division}} {{held the}} ridge north of Bera. It {{was attacked by}} 6,500 soldiers from the British Light Division and Francisco de Longa's Spanish division advancing north from Bera. On the right flank, Béchaud's brigade held the Bayonette Spur which included the Saint Benôit fort and the Bayonette Redoubt. Lecamus' brigade (under Colonel Cambriel) defended the Hog's Back and the Vera Pass on the left flank. Allied forces led by James Kempt drove back Cambriel's brigade rather easily and seized the crest while sustaining only 78 casualties. John Colborne's brigade had more difficult time and its first attack on the Saint Benôit fort was repulsed. The French chased their enemies downhill and were out of order when the British supporting battalion appeared. The Allies returned to the attack and ousted the French from the fort. Then they fought their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the spur where they overran the redoubt also. Colborne's brigade lost 302 men killed or wounded. British officers remarked that the French soldiers fought less stubbornly than in the past. Half of the total French casualties of 1,673 men were in Taupin's division.|$|E
25|$|The north {{transept}} (or Priory End) windows, {{east and}} north, are 19th century but within 14th-century openings. The trussed roof is possibly 16th century with {{tie beam support}} added in the 19th. The south transept (or Hall End) east and south windows are 14th century although partly restored. The 15th-century south transept roof trussing is of hammer beam construction, with curved collar braces springing from beams which are supported by curved chamfered brackets. Running on the wall from the hammer beams to the roof line are wind braces, and to the ridge beam is roof truss framing. Both transepts are separated from the nave by c.20th-century panels and doors rising part <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the arches. The north transept is solid panelling; the south with clear glazed doors to its full width. The north transept is today used as the church vestry room, and the south transept a meeting room with modern furniture. On the south wall of the south transept is a 14th-century piscina with a recessed trefoiled head, a re-cut quatrefoil drain, a head {{of a woman in}} a wimple carved at its apex, and a finial above.|$|E
500|$|Wary of his ageing Arsenal {{team and}} the club's {{inadequate}} reserves (as proven by the Walsall match), it was around this time that Chapman noted to club director George Allison: [...] "The team's played out, Mr Allison, we must rebuild". Chapman started the process, signing Ray Bowden, Pat Beasley and Jimmy Dunne, and had converted the young George Male from left half to right back. Unfortunately, he would not {{live to see the}} end of the season, let alone complete the task of rebuilding his side. Arsenal went into 1933–34 looking to retain the title, and started consistently; they worked their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the league and were a comfortable four points clear after a goalless draw with Birmingham City on 30 December 1933. This proved to be Chapman's last match in charge.|$|E

In the subsequent missions, the killer7 target a number of individuals on behalf of the US government or for personal reasons. They kill Andrei Ulmeyda, a Texan postal worker who established a successful company based on the Yakumo, when he becomes infected with the Heaven Smile virus. Dan Smith confronts Curtis Blackburn, his former mentor and murderer, when Mills informs the group that Blackburn is running an organ trafficking business that targets young girls. Their penultimate mission pits them against the [...] "Handsome Men", a group of sentai rangers who assassinate a US politician.|$|E

He also said that [...] "it's a debut from a band that shows potential but haven't yet achieved it." [...] NMEs Edwin Pouncey said that the album was the [...] "biggest, baddest sound that Sub Pop have so far managed to unearth. So primitive that they manage to make label mates Mudhoney sound like Genesis, Nirvana turn up the volume and spit and claw their <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the musical garbage heap", and gave it an eight out of ten rating.

The dream takes its course, the tree ends the sequence saying they lived happily ever after. However, once the protagonist wakes up, {{he and his father}} are just moving into Long Life Town, which appears very much like a small, Japanese village. Coincidentally, the girl of his dreams lives in this town, but she flatly rejects him due to his status as coming from a very poor family. Taking his father's advice, the hero decides to kiss the odd citizens of the town in order to strengthen his heart and improve his reputation. En route to doing so, he also resolves to write a love letter to his crush. When this treasured set of papers is stolen, he must search Long Life Town for the missing pieces. The hero's journey involves numerous bizarre incidents that lead him to cheating his <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a major corporation, making contact with aliens, and acting as a defense lawyer in court. Once the three pieces of the love letter (the ink, paper, and pen) are collected, he writes and mails it to the girl. The game's ending shows the two meeting and kissing beneath the Lover's Tree, as the protagonist had dreamed.|$|E
