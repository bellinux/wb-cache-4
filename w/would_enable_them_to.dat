5|$|Juventus {{finished}} the 1984–85 Serie A in fifth position, which was {{outside of the}} European qualification positions. In order to participate in European competition in 1985–86, they needed to win the European Cup. Liverpool had finished second behind Everton in the 1984–85 Football League, and thus qualified for the UEFA Cup, but victory in the final <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> compete in the European Cup the following season.|$|E
5|$|Kagame and Rwigyema {{joined the}} NRA {{primarily}} to ease conditions for Rwandan refugees persecuted by Obote. They {{also had a}} long-term goal of returning with other Tutsi refugees to Rwanda; military experience <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> fight the Hutu-dominated Rwandan army. In the NRA, Kagame specialized in intelligence-gathering, and he rose to a position close to Museveni's. The NRA, based in the Luwero Triangle, fought the Ugandan army {{for the next five}} years, even after Obote was deposed in a 1985 coup d'état and the start of peace talks.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool had {{finished}} fifth during the 1980–81 Football League, thus {{they needed to}} win the final {{to ensure that they}} would compete in the European Cup the following season. Despite this, Liverpool had won the Football League Cup for the first time earlier in the season, defeating West Ham United 2–1 in a replay after the final finished 1–1. Real Madrid {{had finished}} second in the 1980–81 La Liga, they had qualified for the UEFA Cup as a result, but victory <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> compete in the European Cup the following season.|$|E

60|$|The editors, {{and their}} contemporaries in general, were ignorant of any but the regular iambic verse. A {{study of the}} Aristophanic and Plautine metres <b>would</b> have <b>enabled</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> reduce B. and F. {{throughout}} into metre, except where prose is really intended.|$|R
25|$|The Congress urged governments {{receiving}} {{aid from}} outside sources to create {{by their own}} efforts and endeavours such conditions as <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> best <b>to</b> profit from the technical and material assistance afforded <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> The Congress hoped these kinds of assistance could then be further expanded.|$|R
5|$|Liverpool had {{finished}} the 1983–84 Football League as champions. They had also won the 1983–84 Football League Cup beating Everton 1–0 in a replay after the final finished 0–0. Their success meant that Liverpool entered the match with the chance of winning an unprecedented treble. Roma {{had finished}} second during the 1983–84 Serie A and won the 1983–84 Coppa Italia, they had qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup as a result, but victory <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> compete in the European Cup the following season.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} early modern {{individuals}} experienced {{a period of}} youth in the modern sense. For many the early teens were marked by moving away from home to undertake life-cycle service, which was necessary {{so that they could}} build up skills and capital that <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> marry and create a separate household. Lower down in society boys might be apprenticed to a trade, or become agricultural servants. Girls might go into domestic or agricultural service. For those higher up in society and increasingly for those lower down, this might be after a period of schooling or even university.|$|E
5|$|Leopold {{wanted to}} begin the tour as soon as possiblethe younger the {{children}} were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, {{as well as the}} great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{the court}} ruled that Article 13 of the Convention, {{relating}} to the right to an effective remedy, had been violated in that the organisers did not have any legal procedure at their disposal which <b>would</b> have <b>enabled</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> appeal the decision before the date on which the march was set to be held.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, several exam {{cheating}} scandals {{gained the}} city nationwide media attention. In July, police arrested thirty-four suspects {{on charges of}} selling electronic devices to high school students which <b>would</b> have <b>enabled</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> cheat on the national college entrance exam. Police confiscated several hundred devices from the suspects, two of whom were local high school teachers.|$|R
5000|$|On 7 December 2005, Nailatikau {{called for}} the {{establishment}} of a [...] "national youth service," [...] under the auspices of the Military, to help reduce unemployment. Young people would learn self-discipline and would be trained for careers, such as engineering, that <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> later <b>to</b> contribute to society through voluntary and paid employment, the Fiji Live news service quoted her as saying.|$|R
5|$|Mallory {{was placed}} on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs. His {{assignment}} became significant when President Millard Fillmore in his Message to Congress of December 13, 1851, recommended Congressional action on two issues. First was the problem {{of what to do with}} ineffective officers in the Navy. At the time, promotion was based solely on seniority, and no policy existed for removing officers who could not or would not fulfill their duties. Second was the issue of discipline in the enlisted rates. The practice of flogging had been outlawed in the previous Congress, and many of the old captains believed discipline on their warships was deteriorating; they wanted a return to the old ways, or at least a reasonable substitute that <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> exert their authority.|$|E
5|$|The {{second factor}} which {{contributed to the}} {{destruction}} of the ARVN 2nd Brigade, II Corps Tactical Zone, was the inability of South Vietnamese commanders to coordinate the withdrawal. In the process of pulling out from the Central Highlands, large numbers of South Vietnamese soldiers and heavy military equipment were stretched out along the narrow corridor of Route 7. Behind the military formation were huge numbers of South Vietnamese civilians who were relatives of the military personnel, as well as government officials and their families. Unfortunately for the South Vietnamese soldiers on the ground, their army simply lacked the logistical system required to maintain the element of secrecy, which South Vietnamese commanders had hoped <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> pull out from the region without drawing too much attention from the North Vietnamese. It is hard to fathom how South Vietnamese commanders hoped to move 400,000 civilians in utmost secrecy. So when North Vietnamese forces attacked the South Vietnamese column along Route 7, there was little South Vietnamese commanders could do to prevent the destruction of their units.|$|E
5|$|Using ten {{orichalcum}} beads {{at a time}} <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> {{control the}} water with the powers they gained, keeping the sea level down to prevent an impending catastrophe. Unknowingly, Indiana starts the machine with the stones, upon which Kerner, Ubermann, and the Nazi troops invade the place and announce their intention to use the machine to become gods. The machine was responsible for creating the mutated skeletons seen earlier, but the Nazis believe that it will work on them due to their Aryan qualities. Ubermann wants to use Jones as a test subject, but Kerner steps onto the platform first, claiming himself to be most suitable for godhood. Just as Ubermann wants to start the machine, Jones mentions Plato's tenfold error, which convinces Kerner to use one bead instead of ten. He is then turned into a horribly deformed and horned creature, and falls into the lava. Indiana is forced {{to step on the}} platform next but threatens Ubermann with eternal damnation once he is a god. Fearing his wrath, Ubermann uses the machine on himself, feeding it one hundred beads. He is turned into a green ethereal being, but his form becomes unstable and he flies apart with an agonized scream.|$|E
50|$|SMEs {{are also}} {{perceived}} to often lack characteristics that <b>would</b> otherwise <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> engage effectively with the sustainable development agenda, barriers for effective engagement being {{both internal and}} external to the firm. It is thought that a lack of institutional enfranchisement of SMEs in the UK is also a key factor in understanding why environmental policies may be ineffective at encouraging proactive environmental performance within smaller firms.|$|R
5000|$|Salihamidžić {{made his}} debut for the Bosnia and Herzegovina {{national}} team in 1996. He scored the team's first ever goal {{in a friendly}} 2-1 win over Italy. During his 11 years with the national team, the closest they came was falling one goal short in a match against Denmark that <b>would</b> have <b>enabled</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> qualify for UEFA Euro 2004. He retired from the national team in 2006.|$|R
50|$|In 2003 the Big East {{was put on}} {{watch as}} the ACC {{announced}} plans to expand from nine teams to twelve, which under NCAA rules <b>would</b> have <b>enabled</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> hold a special conference championship football game. Miami, Syracuse, and BC were rumored to be the three schools under consideration, and all three met with officials from the ACC regarding membership. At the same time, the Big East itself was contemplating its future.|$|R
25|$|Weighing on {{the morning}} of the launch day, January 30, {{demonstrated}} that the aircraft still possessed a reserve in buoyancy, and the crew decided to increase ballast weight by 180 kilograms, which <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> reach 20,500 metres altitude, higher than initial estimates.

25|$|Lighthuggers are {{spacecraft}} {{that travel}} at {{just below the}} speed of light, taking months or years to accelerate to their cruising speed. Although capable of extremely powerful bursts of acceleration, when in transit between stellar systems lighthuggers typically sustain an acceleration of 1 g which <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> reach 99% {{of the speed of}} light in about 2.75 earth years as measured on board the ship.|$|E
25|$|The term Rhodie {{can also}} carry social connotations. During the period after independence, about {{two thirds of}} Zimbabwe's white {{population}} left the country. Those remaining tended to fall into two distinct categories. Firstly, there were individuals of high social status possessing professional skills and property which <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> survive in the new order. Secondly, there were individuals of low social status lacking the skills or qualities needed to emigrate.|$|E
50|$|Interpretations {{continue}} to change. In the 1999 Hunt v. Cromartie case, the US Supreme Court {{ruled that the}} 12th electoral district of North Carolina as drawn was unconstitutional. Determining that it was created to place African Americans in one district (which <b>would</b> have <b>enabled</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> elect a representative), the Court ruled that it constituted illegal racial gerrymandering. The Court ordered the state of North Carolina to redraw {{the boundaries of the}} district.|$|R
50|$|Greek {{mathematics}} was technically {{advanced and}} we know for certain that they employed and understood the principles of pulleys, which <b>would</b> have <b>enabled</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> build jibs and cranes to lift heavy stonework to the upper parts of buildings. Their surveying skills were exceptional, <b>enabling</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> set out the incredibly exact optical corrections of buildings like the Parthenon, although the methods used remain a mystery. Simpler decoration, such as fluting on columns, was simply left until the drums of the columns were cut in place.|$|R
25|$|Educated at Millfield School, Bail was a {{right-handed}} opening {{or middle}} order batsman {{and an occasional}} right-arm off-break bowler. He made his first-class debut with five matches for Somerset in the 1985 season, but made little impact until the last match of the season, against Kent at St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury, when he made an unbeaten 78 in 167 minutes as Somerset sought unsuccessfully to force a victory that <b>would</b> have <b>enabled</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> avoid finishing bottom of the County Championship.|$|R
25|$|Anti-communist raids {{by other}} unions removed some {{conservative}} members and locals from UE, thereby weakening the right-wing internal opposition. Nonetheless oppositionists were {{confident that the}} national political atmosphere <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> seize power in UE at the union's 1949 convention. But the right-wing candidates were soundly defeated. UE's convention delegates instead backed their national officers' demands that the CIO stop the UAW and other CIO unions from raiding UE.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} breed {{of the fighting}} dog was, in its outward appearance, a large, low, heavy breed with a powerful build and strongly developed head, and tremendously threatening voice. Additionally, these {{foundation breed}}s were also bred for a powerful jaw that <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> defend and protect humans, to overpower and pull down large animals on a hunt, and to control large, unmanageable domestic animals. These dogs were also sometimes equipped with metal plates, chains, and collars with sharp spikes or hooked knives {{in order to be}} used in wars throughout history.|$|E
25|$|While {{teaching}} {{for a few}} weeks in Zurich, Dyson was visited by two officials from the Swiss civil defense authority. Their experts were telling them that fairly simple shelters on a large scale <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> survive a nuclear attack, and they wanted confirmation. They knew that Dyson had a security clearance. Dyson reassured them that their shelters would do the job. The US does not build such shelters because it would be contrary to the doctrine of mutual assured destruction, since the US would be able to launch a first strike but survive retaliation.|$|E

25|$|For their part, Frankfurt School theorists quickly came {{to realize}} that a dialectical method could only be adopted if it could be applied to itself—that is to say, if they adopted a self-correcting method—a dialectical method that <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> correct {{previous}} false dialectical interpretations. Accordingly, critical theory rejected the historicism and materialism of orthodox Marxism. Indeed, the material tensions and class struggles of which Marx spoke were no longer seen by Frankfurt School theorists as having the same revolutionary potential within contemporary Western societies—an observation that indicated that Marx's dialectical interpretations and predictions were either incomplete or incorrect.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, when Lovestone went to Moscow {{as part of}} a 10-member {{committee}} to appeal the decision of the Comintern to end American factionalism by reassigning Lovestone and factional opponent Alexander Bittelman to Comintern work abroad, Lovestone entrusted Stachel and Robert Minor with a code that <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> seize the party's assets from any new party leadership should trouble develop during the trip to Russia. The pair had betrayed Lovestone, however, revealing the plot to others in the party — a decision which put the two back in good graces with the Communist International when the Lovestone group was purged from the party organization later in 1929.|$|E
25|$|In March 2005, Senator Johnson re-introduced his American Veterans Disabled for Life Commemorative Coin Act (S. 633). The Senate {{adopted the}} bill {{in the summer of}} 2006.

But the bill stalled in the Financial Services Committee's Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade and Technology. The Disabled American Veterans (DAV) railed against the congressional inaction to its membership in November 2006. But once more legislation died {{at the end of the}} congressional session. Still, memorial planners were optimistic, saying they expected the bill to pass early in the next session—which <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> raise funds much faster and dedicate the memorial in 2010.|$|E
