Kremls masts were hollow iron and were used to ventilate the lower decks, the first such masts in the Imperial Russian Navy. To protect her leadsmen, sailors who determined the depth of <b>water</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> keel, in combat, Kreml was fitted with two sounding tubes that led from the gun deck through the bottom of the hull.|$|E
5|$|Xenon has {{atomic number}} 54; that is, its nucleus {{contains}} 54 protons. At standard temperature and pressure, pure xenon gas has a density of 5.761kg/m3, about 4.5 times {{the density of}} the Earth's atmosphere at sea level, 1.217kg/m3. As a liquid, xenon has a density of up to 3.100g/mL, with the density maximum occurring at the triple point. Liquid xenon has a high polarizability due to its large atomic volume, and thus is an excellent solvent. It can dissolve hydrocarbons, biological molecules, and even <b>water.</b> <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> same conditions, the density of solid xenon, 3.640g/cm3, is greater than the average density of granite, 2.75g/cm3. Under gigapascals of pressure, xenon forms a metallic phase.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} French majority in numbers, {{the attack was}} a disaster: nearly 1,000 French soldiers were killed as the boats were caught in open <b>water</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> island's gun batteries: several were sunk with all hands. Heavy fire from batteries and Royal Marines prevented a single French soldier from landing and the retreating fleet was subject to heavy fire from the smaller island to the north, inflicting further losses. British casualties were negligible. Although this operation indicated the probable result of a full-scale invasion of Britain, the threat remained and British forces began a close blockade of the surviving landing craft that were anchored in the Cotentin ports. A month after the battle this strategy resulted in a secondary success when a French frigate and corvette passing along the coast were intercepted and defeated by the blockade squadron.|$|E

5|$|The Nassers and Naify {{contracted}} with Pflueger in early 1926 to build three large movie theaters in central California cities. They assigned Pflueger {{the design of}} the Tulare Theatre (1927) in Tulare, the Senator Theatre (1928) in Chico and the State Theatre (1928) in Oroville. The $250,000 Tulare Theatre (now demolished) featured motifs based on the Ishtar Gate of Babylon. Pflueger included zigzag patterns in the twin-towered facade trimmed in neon accents, and brought Streamline Moderne stylings to the interior via sweeping curves in steel banister railings as well as Mayan touches in the stepped mirrors. The $250,000 State Theatre appeared Spanish Colonial with its tiled roof and concrete bas-relief exterior, but turned to Streamline Moderne in a 1,529-seat interior that featured chrome railings, plush carpet and indirect lighting. Aztec elements were incorporated in the proscenium design. The $300,000 Senator Theatre was delayed in construction by the discovery of running <b>water</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> foundation, a condition that required channelization and pumps. The movie palace's eclectic theme was largely Egyptian with Moorish, Asian and Aztec details dominated by a landmark tower topped by a giant faceted amber glass gem lit from within.|$|E

25|$|The {{islands are}} part of a {{geologic}} structure known as the Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc system and range in age from 5 million years old in the north to 30 million years old in the south (Guam).

This water is heated and boiled as the plate is carried farther downward and results in the volcanic activity which has formed the arc of Mariana Islands above this subduction region.|$|E

25|$|Signal Troops is an {{integral}} part of the Armed Forces. Its condition and functioning largely influences efficiency of command, the timeliness of combat equipment and weapons. In its development, the Signal Troops has come a long and difficult process that is inextricably linked with the history of the Armed Forces, the changes in the forms and methods of their use and the improvement of military art. From simple audio and visual means of communication for the transmission of signals and commands on the battlefield to widely branched multi-channel, advanced automated systems that can provide a link of virtually unlimited range of both stationary and moving objects on the ground, in the <b>water,</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> water and in the air, this is the historical path of development and improvement of military communications.

25|$|In the 1930s, the {{government}} of Nazi Germany began arresting thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses who refused to salute the Nazi flag {{and sent them to}} concentration camps. The Witnesses taught and still teach that the obligation imposed by the law of God is superior to that of laws enacted by temporal government. Their religious beliefs include a literal version of Exodus, Chapter 20, verses 4 and 5, which says: 'Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the <b>water</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> earth; thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them.' They consider that the flag is an 'image' within this command. For this reason, they refused to salute the flag. Children of Jehovah's Witnesses had been expelled from school and were threatened with exclusion for no other cause. Officials threatened to send them to reformatories maintained for criminally inclined juveniles. Parents of such children had been prosecuted and were being threatened with prosecutions for causing delinquency. In 1935, 9-year-old Carlton Nichols was expelled from school and his father arrested in Lynn, Massachusetts for such a refusal. Additional refusals followed, one such leading to Minersville School District v. Gobitis Even after the Gobitis decision, Jehovah's Witnesses continued to refuse to say the pledge.|$|E

500|$|When British {{scientists}} in Antarctica performed airborne ice-penetrating radar surveys {{in the early}} 1970s, they detected unusual radar readings at the site which suggested {{the presence of a}} liquid freshwater lake below the ice. In 1991, Jeff Ridley, a remote sensing specialist with the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London, directed the ERS-1 satellite to turn its high-frequency array {{toward the center of the}} Antarctic ice cap. The data from ERS-1 confirmed the findings from the 1973 British surveys, but these new data were not published in the Journal of Glaciology until 1993.
