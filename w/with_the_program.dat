5|$|In 2005 {{the group}} moved to WMQM's Millington-based sister station, AM1380 WLRM, and {{switched}} to a nightly schedule, Monday through Friday. Farley left the program in November of that year. Two years later, Geoff Melton, a former co-host, joined to help set up the show's website and the show entered syndication with Dixie Broadcasting Radio Network. The program went on hiatus on February 15, 2008, because staff members said they needed a break, but returned to the airwaves in June 2008 on WLRM on Saturday nights. One year later, it switched from Republic Broadcasting Network to Liberty News Radio Network. As of August 2009, Bonds and Melton are no longer affiliated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>program.</b> Frith now lives in Nashville, Michigan, but remains {{a part of the}} show's staff.

5|$|In September 1967, Melbourne {{travelled}} to the United States {{to collect}} new aircraft: 14 Trackers and 10 Skyhawks. To operate the new aircraft, the carrier received a major refit on {{her return to}} Sydney, which began in December 1967. In May 1967, it was proposed that while Melbourne was out of service, A-4 Skyhawk pilots and maintenance personnel could be attached to a United States Marine Corps Skyhawk squadron in South Vietnam. Australian aircraft {{were not to be}} provided, as the A-4G Skyhawks used by the RAN were optimised for air defence, not the fighter-bomber role performed by the Marines, and would have suffered heavy losses from North Vietnam's heavy anti-aircraft defences. This deployment did not occur; the Skyhawk pilot training program was experiencing delays because US squadrons were being shipped training equipment and replacement parts in priority to the RAN, and sending qualified pilots overseas would have caused further holdups <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> while also disrupting Melbournes post-refit reactivation. Melbourne re-entered service {{at the conclusion of the}} refit on 14 February 1969. She performed sea trials in Jervis Bay from 17 February until 5 May, then sailed for Subic Bay, Philippines, to participate in SEATO Exercise Sea Spirit.|$|E

She also participated in a public service announcement for UNICEF to help starving children. In February 2013, Jackson announced she was married to her third husband, Qatari businessman Wissam Al Mana, during a private ceremony the previous year.|$|E
5|$|The Butlers founded Circus Juventas as {{a nonprofit}} {{corporation}} in October 1994, citing {{a desire to}} give back to the community as {{one of the reasons for}} its creation. It was originally known as Circus of the Star, so called for Minnesota's nickname, The North Star State. The newly opened Hillcrest Recreation Center in Saint Paul provided the couple with inspiration for the circus program, and they asked the city if they could hold classes there. The Saint Paul Parks and Recreation Department approved the program, and assumed liability for approximately fifty children who enrolled the first year. About thirty of those students stayed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> and performed in their first show at the 1995 Highland Fest, an annual family-oriented neighborhood festival. After this performance, interest in the program increased. By 1996, 30 more students were enrolled, and by 1997, an additional 25 had joined the program. The circus was still based out of the Hillcrest Recreation Center's gym, and had to work around the schedule of the other regular activities in the facility. In 1997, the waitlist for the program was around 200 students.|$|E

The ratings vary significantly by method used to determine the success of each program.
