30|$|The key {{findings}} of this paper are threefold. First, the Latvian public <b>works</b> <b>program</b> increased household incomes by 37 percent relative to similar households not benefiting from the program. The increased incomes helped households {{to cope with the}} crisis significantly better than identical households that were not in the public <b>works</b> <b>program.</b> Second, the income that households had to forego was low, and some of the income that was foregone is accounted for by a loss of other safety net payments, suggesting that the public <b>works</b> <b>program</b> did not replace other labor market opportunities. The program increased household income by LVL 67 while the actual public works payment was LVL 100 per month. Third, the public <b>works</b> <b>program</b> targeted poorer households very well, meaning that the design parameters in the public <b>works</b> <b>program</b> performed as expected. Two key design parameters were the relatively low stipend and the labor intensive work requirement led to the good targeting performance.|$|R

Bob is surprised {{to be taken into}} the care of his brother Cecil as the two had previously not spoken for ten years. A flashback reveals the cause of this rift: Cecil had auditioned to become the new sidekick for Krusty the Clown, a job he had long desired, but Bob, who had not originally intended to be the sidekick, was chosen instead. Cecil, who is Springfield's chief hydrological and hydrodynamical engineer, employs Bob to supervise the construction of a hydroelectric dam in a river near Springfield, while Bart, believing that Bob is still evil, continuously follows him around. Bob begins to become intensely annoyed by Bart's intrusions into his personal life and the dam's incompetent laborers (Cletus and his family), and he expresses a desire to see the dam burst and obliterate Springfield.|$|E

Alternatively, we propose prisoners pay into an unemployment insurance fund, be paid unemployment benefits after release up to the amount they paid into the system, and forgo remaining payments if re-incarcerated. Money paid into the system and lost due to recidivism can be kept by the government. Corrections-Based <b>Work</b> <b>Programs,</b> Recidivism, Unemployment Benefits...|$|R

It documents evidence generated by semi‐structured interviews with project staff and participants of the <b>program.</b> Renewal SA’s <b>Works</b> <b>Program</b> at Playford Alive requires private contractors and service providers to deliver either work experience and longer term placements or training {{to a number of}} local unemployed people as a condition of being awarded the contract. Key findings from this report include: 	Early pessimism based upon ideological objections to ‘government interference’ in business decisions proved to be ill‐founded and contractors appear to have embraced the program. 	There exists a diverse range of physical and psychological barriers to the unemployed entering the labour market and this justifies the eclectic nature of the <b>Works</b> <b>Program.</b> 	The ‘three tiered’ structure of the <b>Works</b> <b>Program</b> means that the unique circumstances and support requirements of individuals can be best addressed. 	The <b>Works</b> <b>Program</b> was viewed as particularly useful by women who had taken time out of the labour market due to childcare responsibilities as it enabled them to retrain, build human capital and change career trajectories. 	Both the work experience placement and onsite training offered participants the opportunity to ‘showcase’ themselves and ‘get a foot in the door’. 	The <b>Works</b> <b>Program</b> recruits through multiple entry points, both private sector and public institutions, and has succeeded in creating awareness of the program throughout the community. 	All three streams incorporated within the <b>Works</b> <b>Program</b> have been well used. These streams include: 1) classroom training 2) Live Site training and 3) work experience placements. 	The <b>Works</b> <b>Program</b> generates quantifiable and measureable outcomes, for example new jobs and formal qualifications, however it also generates a range of subjective outcomes which are more likely to encourage longer term employment and other social benefits...|$|R

30|$|The Latvian public <b>works</b> <b>program</b> {{experience}} {{highlights the}} usefulness of public works as a safety net during times of labor market crises. For policymakers and development experts interested in public <b>works</b> <b>programs,</b> this evaluation raises some points worth considering when designing a program. First, setting the stipend level below the binding minimum wage and making participants engage in labor-intensive activities increases the chances of good targeting performance. These conditions make the program only attractive to poor people, and non-poor people are unlikely {{to apply for the}} program. In effect, the public <b>works</b> <b>program</b> becomes a more effective self-targeting program. Self-targeting is particularly useful when fast scale up is needed during times of crises, and knowledge of household welfare is not well known to policymakers. Second, timing public <b>works</b> <b>programs</b> to coincide with spikes in unemployment (shocks, low seasons) can help people during periods when other employment opportunities are limited and alternative income sources are low. In other words, public works can be a good means of fortifying a country’s existing safety net. Third, public <b>works</b> <b>programs</b> during times of crises can help families maintain nutrition and health, thus preventing longer-term problems that might result from reducing food intake or foregoing medical visits. While the past literature has focused on the monetary benefits of safety nets during crises, a well-designed public <b>works</b> <b>program</b> during a crisis can also help households maintain their nutritional intake and can help them continue health checkups and health care.|$|R

To our knowledge, the only other evaluations of crisis-inspired public <b>works</b> <b>programs</b> are found in Latin America, in Argentina (Jalan and Ravallion, 2003 Galasso and Ravallion 2004) and Peru (Chacaltana, 2003).|$|R

500|$|Banks {{undertook}} {{a number of}} steps intended to facilitate the Reconstruction plans of President Lincoln in Louisiana. When Banks arrived in New Orleans, the atmosphere was somewhat hostile to the Union owing to some of Butler's actions. Banks moderated some of Butler's policies, freeing civilians that Butler had detained and reopening churches whose ministers refused to support the Union. He recruited large numbers of African-Americans for the military, and instituted formal works and education programs to organize the many slaves who had wandered from their plantations, believing they had been freed. Because Banks believed the plantation owners would need {{to play a role}} in Reconstruction, the <b>work</b> <b>program</b> was not particularly friendly to African Americans, requiring them to sign year-long work contracts, and subjecting vagrants to involuntary public work. [...] The education program was effectively shut down after Southerners regained control of the city in 1865.|$|E
