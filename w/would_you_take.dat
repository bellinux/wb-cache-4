500|$|Hutchinson {{described}} Steiger's {{mother as}} [...] "plump, energetic and small, with long auburn hair". She {{had a good}} singing voice and nearly became a Hollywood actress, but after a leg surgery permanently impaired her walking ability, she gave up acting and turned to alcohol. As a result, she quit show business and moved away from Westhampton to raise her son. They moved through several towns, including Irvington and Bloomfield, before settling in Newark, New Jersey. Her alcoholism caused Steiger much embarrassment, and the family was frequently mocked by other {{children and their parents}} within the community. At the age of five he was sexually abused by a pedophile who lured him in with a butterfly collection. Steiger said of his troubled family background: [...] "If you had the choice of having the childhood you experienced, with your alcoholic mother and being the famous actor you are today, or having a loving, secure childhood and not being famous, which <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>take?</b> A loving, secure childhood in a New York minute". During the last 11 years of her life, Steiger's mother stayed sober and regularly attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Steiger recalled: [...] "I was so proud of her. She turned herself around. She came alive again".|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, Colón Sánchez {{expressed}} {{her desire}} to run for a seat as Councilwoman. She {{was supported by the}} Democratic town committee; and endorsed by the mayor, several councilmen, and the Hispanic Democratic Reform Club. Despite all of this support for Colón Sánchez, Councilman Nicholas Carbone, who was a powerful figure in the Democratic political machine, supported Mildred Torres instead. Carbone may have been prejudiced against Colón Sánchez's physical appearance and made her feel that she just wasn't ready. According to a statement made by Carbone when she ran for the school board:“We ran María for the school board and she spoke broken English. She wasn't an attractive woman, she was heavy, so where <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> her? How did you sell her? How did you get people to vote for her? And how did you get over the prejudice that she spoke with a thick accent? So we didn't take her into a lot of neighborhoods... You had to be practical as you were trying to get her on the school board.” ...|$|E
2500|$|ZMET {{was born}} {{during a trip}} Zaltman took to remote areas of Nepal in 1990. [...] He gave locals, who had never taken photos before, cameras to take {{pictures}} of important things and events in their lives. [...] For example, in some cases, the assignment was: What photos <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> if you wanted to show someone else what life was like here? Two weeks later he returned to the regions covered initially, gave copies to the photographers, and interviewed them about the meaning of their photos. [...] Zaltman realized just how powerful the use of images “owned” by those being interviewed were in gaining a deep understanding of their implicit or tacit assumptions and beliefs. Zaltman noticed, for example, that they often cut off the feet of people appearing in their images. [...] It was discovered that this was deliberate. The Nepalese did not want to embarrass their friends and neighbors by showing their bare feet, which was a sign of poverty, and for this reason deliberately chose to leave it out of the photographic record.|$|E

6000|$|Schwartz's {{sense of}} humor was tickled by this. [...] "If you could bellow like a bull," [...] he said, [...] "nobody <b>would</b> hear <b>you.</b> <b>Take</b> a seat, ma'am." ...|$|R
6000|$|He greets you; <b>would</b> have <b>you</b> <b>take</b> letters: [...] <b>You</b> {{scan the}} {{addresses}} with dread, While he mutters his donners and wetters,-- [...] They're {{all from the}} dead to the dead! ...|$|R
2500|$|Jonathan Zimmerman {{critically}} {{framed the}} question of Confucius Institutes and academic freedom, [...] "Let's suppose that a cruel, tyrannical, and repressive foreign government offered to pay for American teens to study its national language in our schools. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> the deal?" [...] Zimmerman concluded that more Americans should study Chinese, but [...] "on our own terms, making sure that it also reflects our best civic language of freedom, open discussion, and democracy." [...] Chinese history professor Jonathan Lipman from Mount Holyoke College expressed the dilemma of accepting CI funding thus: [...] "By peddling a product we want, namely Chinese language study, the Confucius Institutes bring the Chinese government into the American academy in powerful ways. The general pattern is very clear. They can say, 'We'll give you this money, you'll have a Chinese program, and nobody will talk about Tibet.' In this economy, turning them down has real costs." [...] Professor Terry Russell at the University of Manitoba questioned the Hanban's real motivation, fearing the university {{would not be able}} to organize certain activities judged [...] "sensitive" [...] to the Chinese, such as bringing the Dalai Lama onto campus. He said, [...] "'We have a real conflict of our principles of academic freedom,' with the potential to have a faculty version of Chinese history and a Confucius Institute version being taught on campus." [...] According to Cameron Morrill, president of the University of Manitoba Faculty Association, [...] "It is inappropriate to allow any government, either foreign or domestic, control over a university classroom, regardless of how much money they offer." [...] The university later decided against taking Chinese government money to set up CIs.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Finsbury, I have {{no means}} of showing you my gratitude; {{but let me ask}} you one question," [...] said Pitman. [...] "If I were a very rich client, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> not <b>take</b> the risk?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We thought <b>you</b> <b>would.</b> <b>You</b> must <b>take</b> the up stage to-night. Come {{again and}} get your final instructions. By the way, you might get some {{information}} at Trixit's house. You--er--er--are acquainted with his daughter, I think?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{begin to}} think I might; but {{although}} I haven't quite made my plans yet, I see some danger. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> a risk for your brother's sake?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, she wouldn't mind you," [...] exclaimed Honora. [...] "I {{could say}} you were an uncle. It would be almost true. And perhaps she <b>would</b> let <b>you</b> <b>take</b> me down to New York for a matinee." ...|$|R

6000|$|Captain. I say of claret--good claret of the Monastery. Ah, sir, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> but <b>take</b> {{the advice}} of your friends, and try to deserve at least {{one-half}} of the public favour you have met with, we might all drink Tokay! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's what I {{think of}} him," [...] {{he said in}} a {{confidential}} whisper, shaking his head at me. [...] "He's gone, sir, gone, in my estimation. Now what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> to be a proof of madness, Mr. West?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{might serve}} {{to pass the}} time," [...] said Nick, gazing with a new {{interest}} at the latticed windows. [...] "How much <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>take,</b> my friend, to let us in at the back way this evening?" [...] he demanded of the porter in French.|$|E
6000|$|...

6000|$|Now turn we to Sir Lamorack: whilst he sat keeping {{watch over}} his swine there {{came to him}} four men from the castle. These say to him, [...] "You must come {{straightway}} with us."
