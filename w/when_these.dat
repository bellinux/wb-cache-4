5|$|Al-Mu'tadid {{took care}} to prepare Ali, his oldest son and heir-apparent, for the {{succession}} by appointing him as a provincial governor: first in Rayy, Qazvin, Qum and Hamadan, <b>when</b> <b>these</b> provinces were seized from the semi-autonomous Dulafid dynasty in ca. 894/5, and in 899 over the Jazira and the frontier areas, when al-Mu'tamid deposed the last local autonomous governor, Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Shaybani. The future al-Muktafi took up residence at Raqqa.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1880s, Alexandru Macedonski and his Literatorul {{attempted}} to preserve Heliade's status and his theories <b>when</b> <b>these</b> {{were faced with}} criticism from Junimea; by 1885, this rivalry ended in defeat for Macedonski, {{and contributed to the}} disestablishment of Literatorul.|$|E
5|$|Dysprosium {{is used in}} {{dosimeters}} {{for measuring}} ionizing radiation. Crystals of calcium sulfate or calcium fluoride are doped with dysprosium. <b>When</b> <b>these</b> crystals are exposed to radiation, the dysprosium atoms become excited and luminescent. The luminescence can be measured to determine the degree of exposure to which the dosimeter has been subjected.|$|E

5|$|Each clan has a {{specified}} area {{of land that}} all members contribute to foraging from and defending. Frequently, territory sizes, normally , are correlated with the abundance of rain and resources in a region; smaller territories occur where insects and resources are plentiful. Additionally, the feeding territories are larger {{during the winter months}} <b>when</b> <b>these</b> birds spend much of their time foraging with the entire clan. White-winged fairywrens occupy much larger territories than other fairywren species.|$|E
5|$|In Sweden, as of 2007 {{there are}} ten {{operating}} nuclear reactors that produce about 45% of its electricity. Two other reactors in Barsebäck {{were shut down}} in 1999 and 2005. <b>When</b> <b>these</b> reactors were built, it was expected their nuclear fuel would be reprocessed in a foreign country, and the reprocessing waste would not be returned to Sweden. Later, construction of a domestic reprocessing plant was contemplated, but has not been built.|$|E
5|$|Initially Milhaud's reserve cavalry {{corps of}} cuirassiers and Lefebvre-Desnoëttes' light cavalry {{division}} of the Imperial Guard, some 4,800sabres, were committed. <b>When</b> <b>these</b> were repulsed, Kellermann's heavy cavalry corps and Guyot's heavy cavalry of the Guard {{were added to the}} massed assault, a total of around 9,000cavalry in 67squadrons.

5|$|Producers in the Indies {{would often}} handle {{multiple}} roles, such as director and cinematographer. <b>When</b> <b>these</b> positions were filled separately, the producer retained creative control. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that works produced {{during this time}} were emphatically commercial, {{not paying attention to}} nationalistic or aesthetic values. However, the film scholars Thomas Barker and Charlotte Setijadi-Dunn suggest that the Chinese-produced films from the Indies offered the possibility of a heterogeneous national identity.|$|E

5|$|The Epagneul Picard Club {{was formed}} in 1921 and was merged with the Club of Blue Picardy Spaniel on 28 July 1937.

5|$|The Sex Pistols {{evolved from}} the Strand, a London band formed in 1972 by working-class {{teenagers}} Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums and Wally Nightingale on guitar. According to a later account by Jones, both he and Cook played instruments they had stolen. They would go to concerts, and <b>when</b> <b>these</b> were over they would go up on stage and steal as much musical equipment as they could carry.|$|E
5|$|The katipo is {{restricted}} to a highly specialised habitat and is only found near the seashore living among sand dunes. They generally reside on the landward side of dunes closest to the coast where they are most sheltered from storms and sand movement. They can sometimes be associated with dunes several kilometres from the sea <b>when</b> <b>these</b> dunes extend inland for long distances.|$|E

5|$|A {{common and}} popular {{structural}} alignment method is the DALI, or distance alignment matrix method, which breaks the input structures into hexapeptide fragments and calculates a distance matrix by evaluating the contact patterns between successive fragments. Secondary structure features that involve residues that are contiguous in sequence {{appear on the}} matrix's main diagonal; other diagonals in the matrix reflect spatial contacts between residues that are not near {{each other in the}} sequence. <b>When</b> <b>these</b> diagonals are parallel to the main diagonal, the features they represent are parallel; when they are perpendicular, their features are antiparallel. This representation is memory-intensive because the features in the square matrix are symmetrical (and thus redundant) about the main diagonal.|$|E
5|$|A dance crew {{is a team}} {{of street}} dancers who come {{together}} to develop new moves and battle other crews. As hip-hop culture spread throughout New York City, the more often breaking crews got together to battle against each other. It was during this time that the different dance moves within breaking developed organically. All styles of hip-hop are rooted in battling, and {{being a part of}} a crew {{was the only way to}} learn <b>when</b> <b>these</b> styles began because they were not taught in studios: they all started out as social dances. Forming and participating in a crew is how street dancers practiced, improved, made friends, and built relationships. In breaking in particular, battling is how b-boys/b-girls improved their skill.|$|E

5|$|A {{parasitic}} fly, Lucilia bufonivora, attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's {{skin and}} <b>when</b> <b>these</b> hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum) {{is unusual in}} that it can climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. It sometimes clings to the toe of a common toad and this {{is believed to be}} one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} four medals were won, one gold, two silver and one bronze. UK Athletics {{performance}} director Dave Collins stood down after the Games. This was {{due in part to}} the team's failure to meet the UK Sport target of winning five medals,. Ironically, a series of retests ordered in the wake of the Russian doping scandal in 2015 and 2016 found that Great Britain athletes had been deprived of medals in a further four events by athletes later confirmed to have doped – the women's heptathlon (Kelly Sotherton), the men's and women's 4 x 400-metre relay teams and women's javelin (Goldie Sayers). <b>When</b> <b>these</b> medals are redistributed, Great Britain's 2008 athletics total of eight medals will be its most successful since the second world war, and 75% over target.|$|E
5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set of two or more closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. <b>When</b> <b>these</b> systems are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; this is known as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E
