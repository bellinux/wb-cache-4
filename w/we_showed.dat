I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E

Denoting by B the product of these elementary matrices, <b>we</b> <b>showed,</b> on the left, that BA = I, and therefore, B = A−1. On the right, we kept a record of BI = B, which we know is the inverse desired. This procedure for finding the inverse works for square matrices of any size.|$|E

For the case of an antenna with perfect conductors (no ohmic loss), Rdipole is identical to the radiation resistance, which can more easily be computed from the total power in the far-field radiation pattern for a given applied current as <b>we</b> <b>showed</b> for the short dipole.

500|$|At {{the time}} the artwork was finalized, Duane Allman was still alive and the title had not been finalized.

Powell later said, [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>showed</b> it to someone at the label, he said, 'They are so hot right now, we could sell it in a brown paper bag'". Atlantic initially intended to title the album The Kind We Grow in Dixie, but the band refused. The title was the label of the postcard series Powell had seen in Athens.

Furthermore, the game had to be recoded to change optimizations that were made for the PlayStation 2 version; Svensson stated that [...] "part of the reason we didn't show it until we started showing it was because, if <b>we</b> <b>showed</b> it {{in a form that}} was anything less than near-perfect, people were going to freak out". Ready at Dawn's creative director Ru Weerasuriya later reflected that porting Ōkami to the Wii was a challenging task—"we started with no assets and literally reverse-engineered the whole thing back onto the Wii"—they did out of love for the game, but the level of effort would preclude them from attempting such a port again.|$|E

40|$|We study {{a general}} sub-class of concave games, {{which we call}} {{socially}} concave games. <b>We</b> <b>show</b> that if each player follows any no-external regret minimization procedure then the dynamics converges {{in the sense that}} both the average action vector converges to a Nash equilibrium and that the utility of each player converges to her utility in that Nash equilibrium. <b>We</b> <b>show</b> that many natural games are socially concave games. Specifically, <b>we</b> <b>show</b> that linear Cournot competition and linear resource allocation games are socially-concave games, and therefore our convergence result applies to them. In addition, <b>we</b> <b>show</b> that a simple best response dynamic might diverge for linear resource allocation games, and is known to diverge for a linear Cournot competition.
