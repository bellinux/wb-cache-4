40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on a new {{approach}} of internet marketing called inbound marketing. Its importance has increased with the enormous changes {{in the field of}} search engine optimisation. Inbound marketing deals with the techniques that are needed to get found by buyers. It is based on free (non-paid) sources like organic search and social media. While the principle of outbound marketing is buying attention through various media, inbound marketing aims to deserve attention through its tools and activities and reach the relevant target group of customers. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the relevance and suitability of inbound marketing as a new trend of internet marketing for selected industries in the Czech market. Based on the web analysis of 69 web sites the importance of unpaid traffic sources is evaluated. The importance is assessed both in terms of the share of total traffic to the website, and in terms of business value, i. e. share of completed <b>website</b> <b>objectives</b> (conversion goals). Findings of the analysis show that the importance of unpaid traffic sources and their efficiency is high across most of researched categories of websites. Therefore, inbound marketing can be considered as a useful tool for building website traffic and increasing website effectiveness...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a planning problem where the dynamics and rewards {{of the environment}} depend on a hidden static parameter {{referred to as the}} context. The objective is to learn a strategy that maximizes the accumulated reward across all contexts. The new model, called Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP), can model a customer's behavior when interacting with a website (the learner). The customer's behavior depends on gender, age, location, device, etc. Based on that behavior, the <b>website</b> <b>objective</b> is to determine customer characteristics, and to optimize the interaction between them. Our work focuses on one basic scenario [...] finite horizon with a small known number of possible contexts. We suggest a family of algorithms with provable guarantees that learn the underlying models and the latent contexts, and optimize the CMDPs. Bounds are obtained for specific naive implementations, and extensions of the framework are discussed, laying the ground for future research...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} free to read on the {{publishers}} <b>website</b> <b>Objective</b> To estimate the cost-effectiveness of Tobacco, Exercise and Diet Messages (TEXT ME), a text message-based intervention that provides advice, motivation, information and support to improve health-related behaviours. Methods A lifetime Markov model was used to estimate major vascular events (myocardial infarctions and strokes) avoided, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, costs to the health system and the incremental cost per QALY gained. The model was informed by data from a randomised controlled trial of TEXT ME, with evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses used to estimate the effects of changes in risk factors on the risk of major vascular events. Expected costs and health outcomes were estimated with uncertainty surrounding these characterised using probabilistic sensitivity analysis {{and a number of}} scenario analyses. Results For a target population of 50 [*] 000 patients with documented coronary heart disease, the intervention is expected to lead to 563 fewer myocardial infarctions, 361 fewer strokes and 1143 additional QALYs. TEXT ME is expected to lead to an overall saving of 10. 56 [*]million for the health system over the patients’ lifetimes. The intervention can therefore be considered cost-saving and health-improving. Neither parameter nor structural uncertainty {{had a significant impact on}} the conclusion that TEXT ME is cost-effective. Conclusions The provision of TEXT ME is predicted to lead to better health outcomes and an overall saving in costs for the health system...|$|R

50|$|Interpretation of the bounce rate measure {{should be}} {{relevant}} to a <b>website's</b> business <b>objectives</b> and definitions of conversion, as having a high bounce rate {{is not always a}} sign of poor performance. On sites where an objective can be met without viewing more than one page, for example on websites sharing specific knowledge on some subject (dictionary entry, specific recipe), the bounce rate would not be as meaningful for determining conversion success. In contrast, the bounce rate of an e-commerce site could be interpreted in correlation with the purchase conversion rate, providing the bounces are considered representative of visits where no purchase was made. Typically, an average Bounce Rate for e-commerce is around 60%, with top performers operating at a 36% average Bounce Rate.|$|R
