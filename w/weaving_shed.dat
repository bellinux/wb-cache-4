25|$|Cloth {{production}} {{moved away}} from the cottage into manufactories. The first moves towards manufactories called mills were made in the spinning sector. The move in the weaving sector was later. By the 1820s, all cotton, wool and worsted was spun in mills; but this yarn went to outworking weavers who continued to work in their own homes. A mill that specialised in weaving fabric was called a <b>weaving</b> <b>shed.</b>|$|E

There are also two local museums: the Weavers' Triangle Trust operates the Visitor Centre and Museum of Local History in the historic surroundings of the Weavers' Triangle, while the Queen Street Mill Textile Museum is unique as the world's only surviving steam driven cotton <b>weaving</b> <b>shed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{industry}} {{is now part}} of Todmorden's history, not its present. The industrial chimneys have largely gone and the remaining mills have mostly been converted for other purposes. The town's industrial base is much reduced (at one time Todmorden had the largest <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> in the world). There has {{been a great deal of}} regeneration activity and Todmorden is now increasingly a commuter town for people working in Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Huddersfield and smaller towns. Todmorden also services the local rural area and attracts visitors through its market (indoor and outdoor), various events, heritage and the local Pennine countryside. Changing work patterns may have influenced the fact that the town was the first rural telephone exchange in Britain to be broadband-enabled through public demand. Rising house prices over recent years are a particular problem as there is limited land available in the valley for building affordable housing. It has for centuries been considered the safest accessible route directly across the Pennines.|$|E

2500|$|The woollen {{industry}} {{developed as}} a cottage industry but during the Industrial Revolution and the mechanisation of the textile industry, mills were built using water then steam power. A cotton mill and <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> for calicoes were built by the river in the late 18th century. Later woolcombing and worsted spinning were introduced. By the mid 19th century 500 inhabitants were employed in two worsted-mills, a paper-mill, and other mills. A tannery {{was established in the}} 19th century. At this time the opening of the new Leeds Road and Bradford Road greatly increased access for trade. Many houses were built {{from the middle of the}} 19th century onwards, including the first row of terraces by the newly formed Otley Building Society from 1847. Otley railway station opened in 1865 connecting goods and people to Leeds, with a connection to Bradford in 1875. [...] At its peak it had 50 trains a day, but it was closed in 1965 under the Beeching cuts. [...] Kirkgate was the first street to be paved in 1866, followed by sewers in 1969.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> is a {{distinctive}} type of single storey mill {{developed in the}} early 1800s in Lancashire, Derbyshire and Yorkshire to accommodate the new power looms weaving cotton, silk, woollen and worsted. A <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> can be a stand alone mill, or a component of a combined mill. Power looms cause severe vibrations requiring them to be located on a solid ground floor. In the case of cotton, the <b>weaving</b> <b>shed</b> needs to remain moist. Maximum daylight is achieved, by the sawtooth [...] "north-facing roof lights".|$|E
