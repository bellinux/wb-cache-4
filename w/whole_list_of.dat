Others state that I am a mercenary of the French secret service and of the Soviet KGB. The latest rumor is that I am an agent of Khomeini. During a certain period they said we were spies for the Iraqi regime. Now they say that we are Syrian agents.... Many psychologists and sociologists in the Soviet bloc tried to investigate this man Abu Nidal. They wanted to find a weak point in his character. The result was zero.|$|E

Billy Bob and I were set to do these roles in 1997, and then it fell apart. That was the cruelest twist for an actor, to get a part you dreamed you'd get and then they decide to scrap the whole thing." [...] Rudin considered casting Anne Heche as Hank's wife Sarah Mitchell. In December 1997, Bridget Fonda, who had previously collaborated with Raimi on Army of Darkness (1992), was cast as Sarah Mitchell.|$|E

30|$|We {{collect data}} from a survey to CSOEs based on two reasons. First, the related data at the group level are not available. Before <b>whole</b> <b>listing</b> <b>of</b> the CSOEs, they only need to {{disclose}} the information on listed companies within the groups. Second, the internal control quality {{is very difficult to}} be evaluated exactly by outsiders. Various proxies of internal control quality have been used in academic studies and practices, such as the disclosure of material weaknesses (Ge and McVay [2005]), auditor's internal control report (Lin and Rao [2009]) and indices based on a matrix of various ratios (Wang et al. [2011]). No matter what measures to be used, the internal control {{is not the same as}} financial reporting with quantity contents and standard forms. Considering information unavailability from the public disclosures, insiders' opinions based on an anonymous promise are better proxies than outsiders' conjectures and deductions.|$|R
40|$|Verbal {{short-term}} memory (STM) is highly sensitive to learning effects: digit sequences or nonword sequences {{which have been}} rendered more familiar via repeated exposure are recalled more accurately. In this study we show that sublist-level, incidental learning of item co-occurrence regularities affects immediate serial recall of words and nonwords, but not digits. In contrast, list-level chunk learning affects serial recall of digits. In a first series of experiments, participants heard a continuous sequence of digits in which the co-occurrence of digits was governed by an artificial grammar. In a subsequent STM test participants recalled lists that were legal or illegal {{according to the rules}} of the artificial grammar. No advantage for legal lists over illegal lists was observed. A second series of experiments used the same incidental learning procedure with nonwords or non-digit words. An advantage for legal versus illegal list recall was observed. A final experiment used an incidental learning task repeating <b>whole</b> <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> digits; this led to a substantial recall advantage for legal versus illegal digit lists. These data show that serial recall of non-digit words is supported by sublist-level probabilistic knowledge, whereas serial recall of digits is only supported by incidental learning <b>of</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lists.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Feasts of {{the order}} were first {{introduced}} {{towards the end of}} the fourteenth century - viz. the Commemoration (Scapular Feast) of 16 July appears first about 1386; Elisha prophet, and Cyril of Constantinople in 1399; St. Albert in 1411; St. Angelus in 1456. Owing to the printing of the first Breviary {{of the order}} at Brussels in 1480, a number of territorial feasts were introduced into the order, such as St. Joseph, the Ten Thousand Martyrs, the Division of the Apostle. The rapture of Elijah (17 June) is first to be found in the second half of the fifteenth century in England and Germany; the feast of the Prophet (20 July) dates at the earliest from 1551. Some general chapters, especially those of 1478 and 1564, added <b>whole</b> <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> saints, partly of real or supposed saints of the order, partly of martyrs whose bodies were preserved in various churches belonging to the Carmelites, particularly that of San Martino ai Monti in Rome. The revision of 1584 reduced the Sanctorale to the smallest possible dimensions, but many feasts then suppressed were afterwards reintroduced.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to the question of}} which degree of complexity is called for in representations of discourse structure. We review recent claims that tree structures do not suffice as a model for discourse structure, with a focus on the work done on the Discourse Graphbank (DGB) of Wolf and Gibson (2005, 2006). We will show that much of the additional complexity in the DGB is not inherent in the data, but due to specific design choices that underlie W&G’s annotation. Three kinds of configuration are identified whose DGB analysis violates tree-structure constraints, but for which an analysis in terms of tree structures is possible, viz., crossed dependencies that are eventually based on lexical or referential overlap, multiple-parent structures that could be handled in terms of Marcu’s (1996) Nuclearity Principle, and potential list structures, in which <b>whole</b> <b>lists</b> <b>of</b> segments are related to a preceding segment in the same way. We also discuss the recent results which Lee et al. (2008) adduce as evidence for a complexity of discourse structure that cannot be handled in terms of tree structures. 1...|$|R

40|$|Habitat {{suitability}} index (HSI) {{and ecological}} site quality (ESQ) {{were used to}} estimate the potential distribution of Cephalotaxus wilsonian with 147 data sites in Taiwan. The habitat factors of the ESQ model included: light response function 【fi(AL) 】, temperature response function（TFi）, soil moisture response function（WiFi）, soil-water saturation response function（WeFi）and soil available nitrogen response function（NFi）. For C. wilsonian is a shade-tolerance species, so we got the mean value of warmth index (γ) 2592. 96, the variation number of warmth index (σ) 1031. 61 and the max value of wilt factor 0. 30. The value should be to normalized into 0 ~ 1. Finally, we got the ESQ with formula: ESQ ={【fi(AL) 】×（TFi）×（WiFi）×（WeFi）×（NFi ）} 1 / 5 and distribution map were made.

Try, therefore, the effect of such a gift; fling into the pre-existing cauldron the <b>whole</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> recognized elementary substances, and give leave to their affinities to work."

60|$|The {{whole affair}} was very amusing at first, {{but it has}} since put me upon {{thinking}} (I like to be put upon thinking; the eighteenth-century essayists were) that {{the attitude of the}} audience towards this deplorable reprobate is really the attitude of most readers of books, lookers at pictures and statues, listeners to music, and so on through the <b>whole</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> the arts. It is absolutely different from the artist's attitude, from the connoisseur's attitude; it is quite irreconcilable with their attitude, and yet I wonder if in the end it is not what the artist works for. Art is not produced for artists, or even for connoisseurs; it is produced for the general, who can never view it otherwise than morally, personally, partially, from their associations and preconceptions.|$|E
