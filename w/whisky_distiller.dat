Six-figure contributions were made by businessmen Ian Taylor and Donald Houston, and by author C. J. Sansom; almost 27,000 donations of under £7,500 had been received by the same date. A later donation came from writer J. K. Rowling, who announced in June 2014 that she had given £1,000,000 to the Better Together campaign. In the following month, <b>whisky</b> <b>distiller</b> William Grant & Sons announced a donation of approximately £100,000.

5000|$|The first {{liquid to}} emerge from the spirit {{condenser}} as the spirit still is heated is the undesirable foreshots, and these are directed from the spirit safe to the low wines and feints receiver for re-distillation. [...] But gradually the undesirable methyl alcohol content reduces and what emerges is the spirit that will end up as <b>whisky.</b> The <b>distiller</b> has to judge the right moment to redirect the flow of product to the spirit receiver instead of the low wines receiver. This is when the alcohol content, measured by a hydrometer in the spirit safe, falls to 75%, or when the emerging spirit no longer turns water cloudy, another test conducted remotely inside the spirit safe.|$|R

Undershaft and Cusins discuss the question of Barbara's commitment to The Salvation Army, and Undershaft decides he must overcome Barbara's moral horror of his occupation. He declares that he will therefore [...] "buy" [...] the Salvation Army. He makes a sizeable donation, matching another donation from a <b>whisky</b> <b>distiller.</b> Barbara wants the Salvation Army to refuse the money because {{it comes from the}} armaments and alcohol industries, but her supervising officer eagerly accepts it. Barbara sadly leaves the shelter in disillusionment.|$|E

50|$|The {{construction}} of the hall was funded by Andrew Usher, a <b>whisky</b> <b>distiller</b> and blender, who donated £100,000 to the city specifically to fund a new concert hall. The choice of site caused early delays but in 1910 an architectural competition was announced with the requirement that the hall be simple but dignified. The winning bid (one of 130 entries) came from Stockdale Harrison & Howard H Thomson of Leicester. The design was partly a backlash against Victorian Gothic, with a return to classical features owing much to the Beaux-Arts style. On 19 July 1911, George V and Queen Mary laid two memorial stones, an event attended by over a thousand people.Its curved walls, unusual for the time, were made possible by developments in reinforced concrete. The dome was designed to reflect the curvature of the walls, not to give a domed interior (which would have been acoustically disastrous).|$|E
50|$|Combat was a brown {{horse with}} a white coronet on his left hind leg bred by his owner John Arthur Dewar who {{inherited}} his Thoroughbred racehorses from his uncle, the Scottish <b>whisky</b> <b>distiller</b> Thomas Dewar, 1st Baron Dewar. These horses included Lady Juror, who became a successful broodmare, producing Fair Trial and the July Stakes winner Riot, the grand-dam of Combat. In {{the same year that}} Combat was foaled, Dewar bred Tudor Minstrel from another daughter of Lady Juror. Combat was from the first crop of foals sired by Big Game the best British colt of his generation whose wins included the 2000 Guineas and the Champion Stakes. Combat's dam Commotion won the Oaks Stakes in 1941 and became a successful broodmare: she also produced the St. James's Palace Stakes winner Faux Tirage and the leading Argentinian sire Aristophanes. Dewar sent the colt into training with Fred Darling at Beckhampton in Wiltshire.|$|E
5000|$|Before 1778, he was {{challenged}} to a duel by Barney Coyle, a <b>whisky</b> <b>distiller</b> {{and member of}} the catholic board, on the ground that he had publicly said that 'a papist could swallow a false oath as easily as a poached egg.' Eight shots were exchanged, but the combatants remained unhurt. Ogle declared that the remark which led to the encounter had been misreported, and he had referred not to 'papists,' but to 'rebels.' Shortly afterwards he publicly stated that [...] some newspapers had misrepresented his sentiments on a former debate, on bringing in a bill to relax the popery laws, and had put words into his mouth which he never said, particularly that he hated an Irish papist, which was foreign to his thoughts. He hated no man on account of his faith. [...] In 1779, he attacked Fox and the opposition in England for not resisting with greater vivacity Lord North's coercive policy in Ireland. Fox wrote to the Duke of Leinster explaining the difficulties of the parliamentary situation at Westminster, and expressed especial regret at Ogle's dissatisfaction, 'because I have always heard that he is a very honest man and a good whig'. In 1779, Ogle joined the association called the Monks of St. Patrick. In 1782, he became a colonel in the Irish volunteers, actively supported that movement, and strongly asserted the claim of Ireland to legislative independence. But when the national convention assembled at Dublin under Lord Charlemont's presidency, in November 1783, Ogle is said to have delivered a message purporting to come from Lord Kenmare to the effect that the Catholics of Ireland were satisfied with the privileges they had already obtained, and desired no more. Kenmare at once denied that he had authorised the delivery of such a message. According to later accounts, Sir Boyle Roche was responsible for the incident, but the contemporary reports saddle Ogle alone with the responsibility for the ruse.|$|E
