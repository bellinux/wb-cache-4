5|$|Echmarcach {{appears to}} have forged an {{alliance}} with the powerful Uí Briain. A leading member of this kindred, Donnchad mac Briain, King of Munster, was married to Cacht ingen Ragnaill, a woman <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> closely related to Echmarcach. Certainly, Echmarcach's daughter, Mór, married one of Donnchad's Uí Briain close kinsmen. Echmarcach's violent career brought him into bitter conflict with a particular branch of the Uí Ímair who had held Dublin periodically from the early eleventh century. This branch {{was supported by the}} rising Uí Cheinnselaig, an Irish kindred responsible for Echmarcach's final expulsion from Dublin and apparently Mann as well.|$|E
5|$|Nyuserre Ini (also Niuserre Ini or Neuserre Ini; in Greek {{known as}} Rathurês, ´Ραθούρης) was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the sixth {{ruler of the}} Fifth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period. He is {{credited}} with a reign of 24 to 35 years depending on the scholar, and likely lived {{in the second half}} of the 25th century BCE. Nyuserre was the younger son of Neferirkare Kakai and queen Khentkaus II, and the brother of the short-lived king Neferefre. He may have succeeded his brother directly, as indicated by much later historical sources. Alternatively, Shepseskare may have reigned between the two as advocated by Miroslav Verner, albeit only for a few weeks or months at the most. The relation of Shepseskare with Neferefre and Nyuserre remains highly uncertain. Nyuserre was in turn succeeded by Menkauhor Kaiu, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> his nephew and a son of Neferefre.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} {{lines of the}} poem Dryden {{describes}} King Cinyras just as Ovid did {{as a man who}} had been happier if he had not become a father. Lee suggests that this is a direct parallel to James <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> counted as happier if he had not had his daughter, Mary, who betrayed him and usurped his monarchical position. When describing the act of incest Dryden uses a monster metaphor. Those lines are suggested as aimed at William III who invaded England from the Netherlands and whose presence Dryden describes as a curse or a punishment, according to Lee. A little further on the Convention Parliament is indicted. Lee suggests that Dryden critiques the intrusiveness of the Convention Parliament, because it acted without constituted legal authority. Finally the daughter, Mary as Myrrha, is described as an impious outcast from civilization, whose greatest sin was her disrupting the natural line of succession thereby breaking both natural as well as divine statutes which resulted in fundamental social confusion. When Myrrha craves and achieves her father's (Cinyras') bed, Lee sees a parallel to Mary's ascending James' throne: both daughters incestuously occupied the place which belonged to their fathers.|$|E

25|$|Julia was {{probably}} born around 76 BC. After {{her mother died}} in 69 BC, she was raised by her paternal grandmother Aurelia Cotta. Her father engaged her to Quintus Servilius Caepio, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Marcus Junius Brutus (Caesar's most famous assassin) who, after being adopted by his uncle Quintus Servilius Caepio, was known as Quintus Servilius Caepio Brutus for an unknown period of time. Caesar broke off this engagement and married her to Pompey in April 59 BC, with whom Caesar sought a strong political alliance in forming the First Triumvirate. This family-alliance of its two great chiefs was regarded as the firmest bond between Caesar and Pompey, and was accordingly viewed with much alarm by the optimates (the oligarchal party in Rome), especially by Marcus Tullius Cicero and Cato the Younger.|$|E

500|$|The main {{antagonist}} of [...] "Terms of Endearment", Weinsider, is a child-murdering demon. However, {{the episode}} plays against genre archetypes by turning Weinsider into a sympathetic villain. Critics {{have pointed out}} that the character's presentation was not entirely negative. Some have commented that Campbell humanized the character, portraying him in a manner that adds likability to a character <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> more sinister. By the time Weinsider is defeated, the audience is led to partially identify with him. He ultimately sacrifices himself {{to save the life of}} his wife, showcasing heroic qualities and subverting the way that villains are often portrayed in the genre.|$|E

[...] His speeches at the Union had more humour in them; the atmosphere was entirely different. But his speeches at the Labour Club were deadly serious... His influence at the Labour Club, more than anyone else's, I think, explains {{the failure of the}} Communists to make headway there.

Gloucester Abbey tried to recover the church in 1175 and again in 1251, and even appealed to the Pope, but without success. The ancient clas establishment {{seems to have}} re-emerged from the brief period of the priory, for mention occurs in the Welsh annals, in the year 1137, of the death of John (Ieuan), arch-priest or archdeacon of Llanbadarn, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> none other than Ieuan ap Sulien, of the great line of Sulien.

500|$|Norman Wilner of MSN {{considered}} Licence to Kill {{the second}} worst Bond film, above only A View to a Kill, but defended Dalton, saying he [...] "got a raw deal.

In October 2008 Time Out re-issued a review of Licence to Kill and also thought that Dalton was unfortunate, saying [...] "one has to feel for Dalton, who was never given a fair shake by either of the films in which he appeared". On a more positive note, Chuck O'Leary of Fantastica Daily remarked that it was a rare entry in the Bond series where the danger seems real.|$|E
500|$|As {{the public}} {{became aware of}} Sánchez's {{situation}} through the media, her death {{became a symbol of}} the failure of officials to properly assist victims <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> saved. Controversy broke out after descriptions of the shortages were released in newspapers, disproving what officials had previously indicated: that they had used the best of their supplies. Volunteer relief workers said that there was such a lack of resources that supplies as basic as shovels, cutting tools, and stretchers ran out. The rescue process was impeded by large crowds and disorganization. An unnamed police officer said that the government should have depended on human resources to alleviate the problems and that the system of rescue was disorganized. Colombia's Minister of Defense, Miguel Uribe, said he [...] "understood criticism of the rescue effort", but said that Colombia was [...] "an undeveloped country" [...] that did not [...] "have that kind of equipment." ...|$|E

50|$|Xenia (ξενία xenía), hospitality, was an {{extremely}} important practice in ancient Greece.
