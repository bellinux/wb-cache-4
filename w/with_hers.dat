5|$|Aerial {{courtship}} displays involve {{single and}} mutual high circling flight, {{and the male}} may fly around slowly with stiff exaggerated flaps, commonly known as butterfly-flight. Courting males dive at the female, feeding her in mid-flight. The female grabs food from the male's talons <b>with</b> <b>hers</b> while flipping upside-down. They may lock talons and tumble downwards in a ritualised version of grappling, but release just before landing. All courtship displays are accompanied by constant calling.|$|E
5|$|Bleach {{was first}} {{conceived}} from Tite Kubo's desire {{to draw a}} shinigami in a kimono, which {{formed the basis for}} the design of the Soul Reapers. Because of this, Kuchiki {{was one of the first}} characters of the series to be created. Before deciding that every Soul Reaper had swords, Kubo thought that they all should use guns, while only Rukia used a scythe. However, this was changed as he created the Soul Reaper kimono. Kubo also mentioned that Rukia did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo Kurosaki to be the series protagonist. Ichigo's initial design had black hair like Rukia; Kubo had to modify Ichigo's appearance to contrast <b>with</b> <b>hers,</b> giving Ichigo orange hair and a trademark scowl.|$|E
5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga series, Kubo commented that Rukia Kuchiki, the first Bleach {{character}} he introduced, was {{originally intended to}} be the protagonist. Through subsequent development of the series, however, Kubo decided to make her a valued ally and instead introduced Ichigo as the central character. Initial design sketches show Ichigo wearing glasses, and having dark hair and softer eyes. When designing Rukia, however, Kubo modified Ichigo's appearance to contrast <b>with</b> <b>hers,</b> giving Ichigo orange hair, a trademark scowl, and removing the glasses. During the series' first chapter, Ichigo's wristwatch was based on one Kubo himself wore at the time. In later chapters, his wristwatch was based on Naoto Fukasawa's W11K cellphone. According to Kubo, Ichigo, along with Orihime Inoue, are the most arduous characters to sketch. While illustrating one of Ichigo's scenes, Kubo found it awkward to draw him with a cheerful smile.|$|E

5|$|Subspecies (1991) follows three college students, Mara, Michelle, and Lillian, as {{they begin}} a study on Romanian culture and superstition {{in the small town}} Prejmer. They are befriended by Stefan, a student {{studying}} nocturnal animals. It is revealed that the nearby Castle Vladislas has been caught in a power struggle between vampire brothers Stefan and Radu. Centuries prior, King Vladislas was seduced and cursed by a sorceress who eventually gave birth to Radu. After banishing Radu's mother, the king met a mortal woman. She gave birth to Stefan, who prefers to live in the open, and loathes his vampire heritage. To gain control over the Bloodstone, a relic that is said to drip the blood of the saints, Radu kills his father. In an effort to hurt his brother, Radu turns Mara and Lillian into vampires. Stefan, having fallen in love with Michelle, helps her try and free Mara and Lillian from Radu's control. Stefan drives a stake through Radu's heart and severs his head with a sword, killing Radu. Unfortunately for Stefan, Radu bites Michelle before his brother can kill him and mingled his blood <b>with</b> <b>hers,</b> which forces Stefan to turn Michelle with his own blood in order to keep her from becoming like Radu. As Stefan and Michelle sleep, Radu's minions set about resurrecting their master.|$|E

25|$|Yamaguchi {{intentionally}} {{tried to}} create uncool and old-fashioned lyrics, in order to juxtapose with the song's modern sound. He wrote the lyrics an hommage to kayōkyoku pop lyrics of the 1970s and 1980s, specifically the songs of Momoe Yamaguchi and Akina Nakamori. Yamaguchi felt that stylistically, the song's chorus melody was directly inspired by Shōwa period kayōkyoku, but someone unfamiliar with the genre might misinterpret as purely inspired by dance music. After Yamaguchi finished songwriting, the band's guitarist Motoharu Iwadera arranged the initial demo, with bassist Ami Kusakari later reworking the demo to blend Iwadera's style <b>with</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{is also no}} {{scene of}} a death in Laura’s {{household}} grounds, nor any party described in them, and after finding her Grenouille does not visit her again until his preparations are complete. Instead, the novel describes Grenouille as deciding to kill his second victim {{in much the same}} manner as the first - purely because of an overwhelming impulse to possess her scent. His other victims are also killed purely for the purpose of practicing human scent preservation and perhaps because of the youthful appearance they all share, somewhat reminiscent of Laura, rather than for their perfume-related qualities or to combine <b>with</b> <b>hers.</b> The final perfume he creates in the book is a combination of ingredients, none of which are described except that from Laura. Laura's father does not encounter Grenouille until the latter is imminently to be executed, and there is no torture scene described in the book in which he is present.|$|E
25|$|Edgar, in his madman's guise, {{meets his}} blinded {{father on the}} heath. Gloucester, not {{recognising}} him, begs Tom to lead him to a cliff at Dover so that he may jump to his death. Goneril discovers that she finds Edmund more attractive than her honest husband Albany, whom she regards as cowardly. Albany has developed a conscience—he is disgusted by the sisters' treatment of Lear, and the mutilation of Gloucester, and denounces his wife. Goneril sends Edmund back to Regan; receiving news of Cornwall's death, she fears her newly widowed sister may steal Edmund and sends him a letter through Oswald. Now alone with Lear, Kent leads him to the French army, which is commanded by Cordelia. But Lear is half-mad and terribly embarrassed by his earlier follies. At Regan's instigation, Albany joins his forces <b>with</b> <b>hers</b> against the French. Goneril's suspicions about Regan's motives are confirmed and returned, as Regan rightly guesses the meaning of her letter and declares to Oswald {{that she is a}} more appropriate match for Edmund. Edgar pretends to lead Gloucester to a cliff, then changes his voice and tells Gloucester he has miraculously survived a great fall. Lear appears, by now completely mad. He rants that the whole world is corrupt and runs off.|$|E

Director of Queen of the Damned Michael Rymer said of Aaliyah, [...] "God, that girl could have gone so far" [...] and spoke of her having [...] "such a clarity about what she wanted.

Jenna dislikes the idea, but plays along. On her birthday, Jenna, upset that no one pays attention to her, decides to fake an injury to get sympathy, to no avail. To get attention, Jenna is seen riding a wheelchair, but this fails, so she gets fed up with everyone. Tracy sees Jenna jumping out of a wheelchair to get attention and tells her that his birthday wish was that she get better, after seeing her wear a back brace at the birthday party.|$|E

Four remixes were released in club stations around the United States, {{with one of them}} peaking at number four on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart. The song, along with [...] "Nothing Fails", topped the US Hot Dance Singles Sales chart and also charted on the ARIA Club Tracks in Australia. Madonna did a performance of the song alone on stage on her Re-Invention World Tour in 2004. It was also used as a video interlude on The MDNA Tour in 2012, showing Madonna's face morphed with a number of famous figures. French far right politician Marine Le Pen sued Madonna for superimposing a swastika and Adolf Hitler's face <b>with</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E
500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] {{sounds more like}} a children's lullaby than a pop song. A baroque and {{psychedelic}} pop song, it begins {{with the sound of}} strings, ushering a joyous melody, with Madonna singing in a full voice. The verses are sung without any background vocals to accompany Madonna's voice. However, in the chorus, when she sings the lines, [...] "Pink elephants and lemonades, Dear Jessie hear the laughter raining on your love-parade", a different set of vocals are interwoven <b>with</b> <b>hers,</b> continuously chanting the words [...] "La-la". Synthesizer and strummed acoustics are added during the second verse, followed by the repetition of the chorus, when a change in tempo and time signature occurs, followed by the sound of a child's laughter.|$|E

She cares for the huskies that Liquid intended to kill, as she enjoys their company, and is impressed with the hostage scientist Hal [...] "Otacon" [...] Emmerich giving his scarce food supply to the dogs. When Solid Snake (further referred to as Snake) infiltrates the island, Sniper Wolf wounds Snake's companion Meryl Silverburgh to lure him into a trap, capturing him so he could be tortured by another FOXHOUND member, Revolver Ocelot. Eventually, Snake defeats her in sniper duel in a snowy field by shooting her in the lung. After hearing Sniper Wolf's story of her life, and at her request to be at last [...] "set free", Snake kills her over objections by Otacon, who professes his love for her. Solid Snake also uses her handkerchief to avoid attacks by her wolves by masking his scent <b>with</b> <b>hers.</b> Sniper Wolf's ghost can be seen if the player uses the in-game photo camera on her body.|$|E

500|$|Stone gave Charlie Sheen {{the choice}} of Jack Lemmon or Martin Sheen to play his father in the film, and Sheen picked his father. The elder Sheen related to the moral sense of his character. Stone cast Daryl Hannah as Bud Fox's materialistic girlfriend Darien Taylor, but {{felt that she was}} never happy with the role and did not know why she {{accepted}} it. He tried to explain the character to Hannah repeatedly, and thought that the materialism of the character conflicted with Hannah's idealism. Stone said later that he was aware early on that she was not right for the part. [...] "Daryl Hannah was not happy doing the role and I should have let her go. All my crew {{wanted to get rid of}} her after one day of shooting. My pride was such that I kept saying I was going to make it work". Stone also had difficulties with Sean Young, who made her opinions known that Hannah should be fired and that she should play that role instead. Young would show up to the set late and unprepared. She did not get along with Charlie Sheen, which caused further friction on the set. In retrospect, Stone felt that Young was right and he should have swapped Hannah's role <b>with</b> <b>hers.</b> Stone admits that he had [...] "some problems" [...] with Young, but was not willing to confirm or deny rumors that she walked off with all of her costumes when she completed filming.|$|E

2500|$|The {{second season}} of the TV show Arrow {{featured}} an episode titled [...] "Birds of Prey," [...] which centers around the characters Dinah Laurel Lance (Katie Cassidy); the Canary, Sara Lance (Caity Lotz); and the Huntress, Helena Bertinelli (Jessica De Gouw). Despite the title, the episode does not feature the two masked women teaming up and the only said team up was between Laurel and her sister, Sara. The Canary and her vigilante crime-fighting partner the Arrow (Stephen Amell) attempt to bring the Huntress in after they help the police bring in Frank Bertinelli (Jeffrey Nordling), Helena's father who was in hiding from her since season one. Helena arrives at the courthouse to kill her father and after a firefight between her, her thugs, and SWAT, she takes hostages, including Laurel. She demands her father but the Canary intervenes to save her sister, but is thrown out a window by Helena. Due to the two meeting in season one, Laurel tries to reason with Helena and talks about her own experiences and how she's finally dealing, urging Helena to deal <b>with</b> <b>hers.</b> Helena takes Laurel and escapes with her after Oliver informs her that he will trade her for Frank. During the exchange, Frank apologizes for causing his daughter so much pain and Arrow urges her not to kill him. A violent SWAT member shows up after following Laurel's cell phone signal and opens fire on the vigilantes due to his hate for them. After he is dealt with, Canary and Huntress fight once again, with Sara almost killing Helena before Laurel persuades her not to. Sara lets Helena go. Helena discovers her father dead and becomes remorseful, and later admits to Oliver while in custody that he was right and that killing her father didn't solve anything. Oliver then assures her {{that she is not}} alone.|$|E

Like Jackson's first wife, Rowe supported the entertainer when he was accused of child sexual abuse. Jackson kept his friendship with Rowe a secret from his wife, who eventually found out but thought nothing of it; she felt the dermatologist's assistant was not her husband's type because she was not glamorous enough.|$|R
