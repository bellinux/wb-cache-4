However, on January 17, 2015, Fox Television Group chairman and CEO Gary Newman revealed that there was network interest in reviving The X-Files, not as a movie franchise, but as a limited run television event.|$|E

25|$|The X-Files: I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe</b> is a 2008 American supernatural thriller film {{directed}} by Chris Carter and written by both Carter and Frank Spotnitz. It {{is the second}} feature film installment of The X-Files franchise created by Carter, following the 1998 film. Three main actors from the television series, David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, and Mitch Pileggi, reappear in the film to reprise their respective roles as Fox Mulder, Dana Scully, and Walter Skinner.|$|E

The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service credits Fitin with rebuilding the depleted foreign intelligence department after Stalin's Great Terror. Fitin also is credited with providing ample warning of the German Invasion of 22 June 1941 that began the Great Patriotic War. Only the actual invasion saved Fitin from execution for providing the head of the NKVD, Lavrenty Beria, with information General Secretary of the CPSU, Joseph Stalin did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b> Beria retained Fitin as chief of foreign intelligence until the war ended but demoted him.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary {{mathematical}} empiricism, {{formulated by}} Quine and Putnam, is primarily {{supported by the}} indispensability argument: mathematics is indispensable to all empirical sciences, and if we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in {{the reality of the}} phenomena described by the sciences, we ought also believe in the reality of those entities required for this description. That is, since physics needs to talk about electrons to say why light bulbs behave as they do, then electrons must exist. Since physics needs to talk about numbers in offering any of its explanations, then numbers must exist. In keeping with Quine and Putnam's overall philosophies, this is a naturalistic argument. It argues for the existence of mathematical entities as the best explanation for experience, thus stripping mathematics of being distinct from the other sciences.|$|E

500|$|The X-Files {{has spawned}} one sequel, a 2008 film {{entitled}} [...] released {{six years after}} the series ended. The film performed modestly {{at the box office}} and received a less positive response than the first film. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Chris Carter announced that if I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe</b> proved successful, he would propose that a third movie go back to the television series' mythology and focus on the alien invasion foretold within the series, due to occur in December 2012. No third movie appeared; instead, the TV series was revived in 2016.|$|E
500|$|As writers Carter and Frank Spotnitz {{aimed to}} avoid complicating the storyline of [...] with {{superfluous}} appearances of characters {{from the television}} series, Skinner is the only returning character in the movie. He {{was included in the}} film's plot only when a fitting opportunity to involve him arose, and Spotnitz and Carter were very happy to write Skinner into the story. The scenes of The X-Files: I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe</b> that include Skinner were filmed very late in the movie's filming schedule, and the particular scene that acts as the character's introduction in the movie was filmed, for reasons of time, in two different locations.|$|E

Less {{than a week}} later, {{the occupied}} government proclaimed that all Jews in Belgium would {{have to wear a}} yellow badge on their clothing, and in July the Gestapo began raids on Jewish premises, followed by deportations of Jews to Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps, resulting in around 32,000 Belgian Jews being killed. Hergé later recalled: [...] "I saw very few Jews wearing the yellow star, but finally I did see some. They told me that some Jews were gone; that people had come for them and sent them away.

500|$|The {{episode is}} one of many to feature Mulder as a Christlike figure. In We <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe,</b> Amy Donaldson writes that the episode is the most {{dramatic}} of Mulder's [...] "multiple resurrections". She compares his resurrection to Jesus's, who Mulder outdoes [...] "by staying in the grave for three months instead of simply three days." [...] During Mulder's funeral the minister reads John 11:25–26: [...] "Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die". According to scripture, Jesus spoke these words when he raised Lazarus of Bethany from the dead; biblical scholars note that the verse also foreshadows his resurrection. The verse was also used by a necromancer in the seventh-season's [...] "Millennium", but for the wrong reason. The necromancer wants to raise the dead by reciting the verse, but only their bodies return as zombies. In [...] "Deadalive", Mulder returns from the dead in both mind and body.|$|E
500|$|The X-Files was {{inspired}} by earlier television series which featured elements of suspense and speculative fiction, including Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, Tales from the Darkside, and especially [...] When creating the main characters, Carter sought to reverse gender stereotypes by making Mulder a believer and Scully a skeptic. The first seven seasons featured Duchovny and Anderson equally. In the last two seasons, Anderson took precedence while Duchovny appeared intermittently. New main characters were introduced: FBI agents John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish). Mulder and Scully's boss, Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), also became a main character. The first five seasons of The X-Files were filmed and produced in Vancouver, British Columbia, before eventually moving to Los Angeles to accommodate Duchovny. The series later returned to Vancouver to film The X-Files: I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe</b> {{as well as the}} tenth season of the series.|$|E

5000|$|... "Torchlight" [...] {{is a song}} by Australian singer-songwriter Missy Higgins, {{written for}} the {{upcoming}} Australian film Don't Tell, a true story about a young girl seeking justice against the church. In the ballad, Higgins sings of the issues explored in the film: [...] "Sometimes evil is a quiet town where nobody <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> hear your truth/ and nobody <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> you." ...|$|R
500|$|The episode makes {{prominent}} use of John 11:25–26 {{from the}} Christian Bible, which reads [...] "Who soever liveth and believeth in me shall never die". These {{were the words}} that were {{believed to have been}} said by Jesus when he raised Lazarus of Bethany from the dead; biblical scholars have noted that the verse was also intended as a foreshadow of his resurrection. For this reason, the verse is used in the episode to represent a physical resurrection from the dead. However, Amy Donaldson, in her book We <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe,</b> notes that the verse is used for the wrong reasons in [...] "Millennium"; the necromancer is able to successfully raise the dead by reciting the line, but only their bodies, resulting in mindless zombies. Later, the verse reappears in the eighth season episode [...] "Deadalive" [...] during Mulder's funeral. In this instance, the verse is used to symbolize its true intentions, and Mulder is returned from the dead, both in mind and body.|$|E
500|$|In several {{interviews}} {{around the}} release, Carter {{said that if}} the X-Files: I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Believe</b> film proved successful at the box office, a third installment would be made going back to the TV series' mythology, focusing specifically on the alien invasion and colonization of Earth foretold in the ninth-season finale, due to occur on December 22, 2012. In an October 2009 interview, David Duchovny likewise said he wanted to do a 2012 X-Files movie, but did not know if he would get the chance. Anderson stated in August 2012 that a third X-Files film is [...] "looking pretty good". As of July 2013, Fox had not approved the movie, although Carter, Spotnitz, Duchovny and Anderson expressed interest. At the New York Comic Con held October 10–13, 2013, Duchovny and Anderson reaffirmed that they and Carter are interested in making a third film, with Anderson saying “If it takes fan encouragement to get Fox interested in that, then I guess that's what it would be.” ...|$|E
500|$|Owing to its {{popularity}} and media exposure, the Flying Spaghetti Monster {{is often used}} as a modern version of Russell's teapot. Proponents argue that, since {{the existence of the}} invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster—similar to other proposed supernatural beings—cannot be falsified, it demonstrates that the burden of proof rests on those who affirm the existence of such beings. Richard Dawkins explains, [...] "The onus is on somebody who says, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in God, Flying Spaghetti Monster, fairies, or whatever it is. It is not up to us to disprove it." [...] Furthermore, according to Lance Gharavi, an editor of The Journal of Religion and Theater, the Flying Spaghetti Monster is [...] "ultimately...an argument about the arbitrariness of holding any one view of creation", since any one view is equally as plausible as the Flying Spaghetti Monster. A similar argument was discussed in the books The God Delusion and The Atheist Delusion.|$|E
