You KNOW that your sins will find you out. Look boldly and honestly into your own hearts.

40|$|Abstract. All {{consensus}} hierarchies in {{the literature}} assume that we have, in addition to copies of a given object, an unbounded number of registers. But <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> really <b>need</b> these registers? This paper considers {{what would happen if}} one attempts to solve consensus using various objects but without any registers. We show that under a reasonable assumption, objects like queues and stacks cannot emulate the missing registers. We also show that, perhaps surprisingly, initialization, shown to have no computational consequences when registers are readily available, is crucial in determining the synchronization power of objects when no registers are allowed. Finally, we show that without registers, the number of available objects affects the level of consensus that can be solved. Our work thus {{raises the question of whether}} consensus hierarchies which assume an unbounded num-ber of registers truly capture synchronization power, and begins a line of research aimed at better understanding the interaction between read-write memory and the powerful synchronization opera-tions available on modern architectures. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> still <b>need</b> libraries? Surely {{everyone}} gets their information through search engines and social media. If people are self-educated, {{what is the}} purpose of having institutions of public education like libraries or museums? These questions assume that Google and Twitter have completely equalized the playing field of information, and libraries are a redundant luxury. In some ways, this is actually true. But this school of thought comes from a place of privilege and assumes that everyone has digital access. It also does not account for all the other ways that libraries serve the public, which I examine thoroughly in my research. Libraries also have a unique sense of community. Ever since they began, libraries have been adapting to the specific communities they serve. They have become so incredibly in tune with what their patrons need that no two libraries look the same. When the library is fulfilling the specific needs of their customers, this creates an impactful relationship between the library and its community. In order to see how libraries connect with and impact their communities, I have interviewed staff members at six different libraries around North America, serving communities in: Anapra, Mexico, Belle Plaine, Iowa, Kansas City, Missouri, Muncie, Indiana, and Queens, New York. I asked them about what resources they have, what their demographic looks like, what funding they receive, and what sort of impact they thought their library made on the community. This is all to examine the effectiveness of the relationship of the library and its patrons as well as the culture that this relationship manifests. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{give new}} {{criteria}} for affineness {{of a variety}} defined over C. Our main result is that an irreducible algebraic variety Y (may be singular) of dimension d (d ≥ 1) defined over C is an affine variety {{if and only if}} Y contains no complete curves, H i (Y, OY) = 0 for all i> 0 and the boundary X − Y is support of a big divisor, where X is a projective variety containing Y. We construct three examples to show that a variety is not affine if it only satisfies two conditions among these three conditions. We also give examples to demonstrate the difference between the behavior of the boundary divisor D and the affineness of Y. If Y is an affine variety, then the ring Γ(Y, OY) is noetherian. However, to prove that Y is an affine variety, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not start from this ring. <b>We</b> explain <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not <b>need</b> to check the noetherian property of the ring Γ(Y, OY) directly but use the techniques of sheaf and cohomology...|$|R

Due to these various inquiries, there have been numerous hypotheses and theories concerning the Resurrection, and in turn sheds light on who God is, who Jesus was, and the meaning of it all. The death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ is central to Christians and their Salvation; however, there are many different definitions and/or analyses of these two events.

30|$|Whilst experts—mostly {{from the}} fields of biology and ecology—have and are making {{contributions}} to this debate, scholars of hazard and disaster have been less attentive on the issue. Given the traditional focus by hazard and disaster scholars to concepts of equity, justice, and marginality underlying the vulnerability of humans to hazards and disasters, it seems appropriate that they bring their knowledge and skills to considering {{the idea that the}} more-than-human are experiencing injustice and a lack of equity in terms of the negative impacts of the Anthropocene on them. Malm and Hornborg (2014) argue that intra-species inequalities are unfortunately a part of the ecological crisis represented by the Anthropocene. However, do they need to be? Humanity—some of it anyway—is currently making decisions about which species to try and conserve and save from extinction whilst allowing others to disappear. Humans are actively ‘marginalizing’ some species over others. For example, iconic species such as polar or panda bears are easy to sympathize with. However, less attention is given to other species not so cuddly and cute. For example, no protests are held to protect the rights of, and to save bacteria, we cannot see or perhaps think are less worthy. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> try to give voice to some of the more-than-human but not others (Gibson-Graham 2011; Whitehouse 2015)? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> champion the <b>needs</b> and rights of some species but silence others?
