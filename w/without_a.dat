40|$|Abstract. A new boost {{converter}} <b>without</b> <b>an</b> inductor is proposed for a small-scale wind power generator system. Experiments {{were carried out}} to compare the output powers and power conversion efficiencies for the converter <b>without</b> <b>an</b> inductor and the one with an inductor. Experimental results for the converters operated at both constant resistance mode and constant voltage mode were given. It was found that efficiencies for the converter <b>without</b> <b>an</b> inductor and for the one with an inductor are essentially the same. The cost may be reduced since the inductor is not needed in the proposed {{boost converter}} <b>without</b> <b>an</b> inductor...|$|R
