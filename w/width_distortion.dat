40|$|It {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} performances in the television receivers to reproduce a picture faithfully from the broadcasting signal. Usually, in the direct view type television receiver, there exists a problem that an original picture is distorted by the change of the horizontal width. This problem is caused by the voltage change of the high voltage source to supply the color picture tube (anode voltage of the picture tube) with brightness of the video signal. Many circuits have been proposed to improve this problem. However in the conventional circuit, the horizontal <b>width</b> <b>distortion</b> seems to be not always improved sufficiently. This paper presents a novel horizontal output circuit, which has a function to correct the horizontal <b>width</b> <b>distortion</b> without any side effects such as a voltage change in the low voltage sources. In the proposed circuit the picture distortion is improved to less than one fourth of that in the conventional circuit when the white peak video signal is received. 1...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of joint shape and texture coding in video {{compression}} is considered. The shape is approximated using polygons or higher order curves. The texture is encoded using Shape Adaptive Discrete Cosine Transform (SA-DCT). The solution is optimal in the operational rate distortion sense i. e. given a coding setup, the solution will guarantee the smallest possible total rate for a given distortion for both shape and texture coding or the smallest possible distortion for a given rate. Both a fixed-width and a variable <b>width</b> <b>distortion</b> band for shape coding were considered. The variable width of the distortion band {{is a function of}} the texture profile i. e. the width is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the image gradient.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to add to the current {{research}} in the area of bite mark distortion with the intent to increase the accuracy and reliability of bite mark interpretation. Institutional Review Board approval was granted for this study. Inked impressions, substituted for actual bite marks, were stamped onto participating volunteers' shoulders. Impressions were then observed at four changes in arm positions. Conventional photographic methods, with an ABFO # 2 reference scale, were used to determine measurements of individual tooth width and intercanine distance. The maximum tooth <b>width</b> <b>distortion</b> observed was 53. 8 % while maximum intercanine distance distortion was 41. 9 %. Distortion was found to increase with age and weight in addition to being non-uniform across a dental arch. Results indicate a need for future research in the area of distortion and the possible reevaluation of the use of bite mark analysis as a forensic tool...|$|E

40|$|A {{prominent}} use {{of local}} to unity limit theory in applied {{work is the}} construction of confidence intervals for autogressive roots through inversion of the ADF t statistic associated with a unit root test, as suggested in Stock (1991). Such confidence intervals are valid when the true model has an autoregressive root that is local to unity (ρ = 1 + c n) but are invalid at {{the limits of the}} domain of definition of the localizing coeffi cient c because of a failure in tightness and the escape of probability mass. Consideration of the boundary case shows that these confidence intervals are invalid for stationary autoregression where they manifest locational bias and <b>width</b> <b>distortion.</b> In particular, the coverage probability of these intervals tends to zero as c → −∞, and the width of the intervals exceeds the width of intervals constructed in the usual way under stationarity. Some implications of these results for predictive regression tests are explored. It is shown that when the regressor has autoregressive coeffi cient |ρ | < 1 and the sample size n → ∞, the Campbell and Yogo (2006) confidence intervals for the regression coeffi cient have zero coverage probability asymptotically and their predictive test statistic Q erroneously indicates predictability with probability approaching unity when the null of no predictability holds. These results have obvious implications for empirical practice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{growing demand}} for {{broad-band}} wireless communication links {{and the lack of}} wide frequency bands within the conventional spectrum, causes us to seek bandwidth in the higher microwave and millimeter-wave spectrum at extremely high frequencies (EHF) above 30 GHz. One of the principal challenges in realizing modern wireless communication links in the EHF band are phenomena occuring during electromagnetic wave propagation through the atmosphere. A space-frequency approach for analyzing wireless communication channels operating in the EHF band is presented. Propagation of the electromagnetic radiation is studied in the frequency domain, enabling consideration of ultrawide-band modulated signals. The theory is employed for the analysis of a communication channel operating at EHF which utilizes pulse amplitude modulated signals. The atmospheric absorptive and dispersive effects on pulse propagation delay, pulse <b>width</b> and <b>distortion</b> are discussed. The theory and model are demonstrated in a study of ultrashort-pulse transmission at 60 GHz.

40|$|Monopulse radars {{are used}} to track targets that appear in the look {{direction}} beam <b>width.</b> The <b>distortion</b> of the tracking information produced when high power interference signals (jamming) are introduced through the radar antenna can cause severe erroneous outcomes from the monopulse tracking processor. This leads to errors in the target tracking angles that may cause target mistracking. New monopulse radar structures that utilizes an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based denoising processor are presented in this paper. EMD filtering is carried out for the complex radar chirp signal with subsequent detrending, thresholding, and denoising processes. These processes {{are used to}} decrease the noise level in the radar processed data to improve the signal to noise ratio. The performance enhancement using the monopulse radar tracking system with EMD based filtering is included using the standard deviation angle estimation error (STDAE) for different jamming scenarios and different target SNRs. STDAE shows that the new EMD based system works well {{in the case of}} main beam interference and side lobe interference for the conventional processor and, {{in the case of the}} spatial adaptive processor, is effective in the case of main lobe interference...|$|R
40|$|Ferroelectrics are {{materials}} exhibiting spontaneous {{electric polarization}} due to dipoles formed by displacements of charged ions inside the crystal unit cell. Their exceptional properties are exploited {{in a variety}} of microelectronic applications. As ferroelectricity is strongly influenced by surfaces, interfaces and domain boundaries, there is great interest in exploring how the local atomic structure affects the electric properties. Here, using the negative spherical-aberration imaging technique in an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope, we investigate the cation-oxygen dipoles near 180 degrees domain walls in epitaxial PbZr(0. 2) Ti(0. 8) O(3) thin films on the atomic scale. The <b>width</b> and dipole <b>distortion</b> across a transversal wall and a longitudinal wall are measured, and on this basis the local polarization is calculated.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{apparent}} superluminal propagation of electromagnetic pulses in a linear dispersive medium. One specifically examines {{the possibility that the}} pulse leaving the medium may be nearly identical to the incident one (low distortion) and in significant advance of it (strongly negative group-delays). Favourable conditions are obtained in a dilute medium where the required anomalous dispersion originates in an ensemble of narrow absorption or gain lines. Analytical expressions of the advancement of the pulse centre-of gravity and of the lowest order distortion are established from the transfer-function of the medium. The experiments already achieved with arrangements involving a single absorption-line or a gain-doublet are analysed in detail and compared. The considerable difficulties to overcome in order to attain advancements comparable to the pulse <b>width</b> without important <b>distortion</b> are pointed out.

40|$|The {{images of}} the {{mechanical}} responses were analysed when the fingertip was pressed against a plateau plate, {{and the influence of}} the contact angle on the loading pressure and the mechanical responses was investigated. As a result, as the contact angle was smaller, the change ratios due to the loading pressure were significantly larger in the contact length, the contact <b>width</b> and the <b>distortion</b> of lateral-view area. These parameters were thought to be useful in clinical medicine as indices for the degrees of mechanical responses of the fingertip. The length of the central axis and the maximum width of the fingertip were inappropriate as the parameters to represent the mechanical responses of the fingertip. The maximum width of the fingertip scarcely changed. This does not reflect the compressibility of the fingertip, and the fingertip as a whole extended along the central axis and in the vertical direction, and the change was not reflected in the maximum width...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Renewable {{energy sources}} are quickly {{becoming}} incorporated into increasingly distributed electrical utility grids. An ever present issue when interfacing these sources {{is that of}} harmonic distortion reduction at the inter-tie point. One very interesting approach to reduce harmonic distortion is to synchronize power transistor operation for inverters operating in parallel. In this paper, a rarely employed technique for harmonic reduction using synchronized phase shifted parallel PWM inverters with current-sharing reactors is presented and analyzed. Using the technique presented inverter output distortion can be reduced significantly, for example total harmonic reduction can be reduced typically in half using just two synchronized phase-shifted parallel inverters (our simulation and experimental studies indicate that even smaller distortion reduction factors can be achieved). We present analyses for two and three phase-shifted inverters operated in parallel employing current sharing reactors. Our analyses consider {{the impact of a}} wide range of phase-shift delays on net output total harmonic distortion, with the phase-shift delay from zero to one entire cycle of the fundamental component. Some results are expected, such as a dramatic increase in distortion when the fundamental components between multiple inverters tend to cancel out, on the other hand it is interesting to observe a leveling-off, and gradual, smooth increase in the distortion reduction factor over a significant portion of the phase-shift delay variable.

The test focuses on the area and characteristic of distortion zone, fault propagation and location of surface ruptures. Based on the test, it is found that (1) the magnitude of normal fault movement has insignificant effect on the area of the distortion zone at the ground surface; (2) the shape of distortion zone in the clay is triangular and the <b>width</b> of this <b>distortion</b> zone at the ground surface is about the same as the depth of the soil underneath; (3) the main fault rupture propagates upward vertically; and (4) surface ruptures are located {{at the edge of the}} distortion zone on the side of the bedrock foot wall.

40|$|In this letter, a {{large scale}} {{investigation}} is carried out, utilizing several spectral shapes as the source for direct modulation based frequency dithering (DMFD). DMFD mitigates the nonlinear effect of long term evolution (LTE) radio-over-fiber (RoF) systems. The dithering signal shapes are; sine, square, saw, sinc and Gaussian with different spectral width characteristics. We show that by varying the dithering signal with increasing spectral <b>width,</b> no additional <b>distortion</b> is introduced in the linear and optimum optical launch power regions, which are dominated by the frequency chirp and chromatic dispersion (CD). Additionally, it is revealed herein that introducing dithering signals with varying spectral widths {{does not change the}} nonlinear compensator characteristic towards suppression of nonlinearity. The {{reason for this is that}} as long as the optical source linewidth is larger than stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) linewidth, the proposed method completely suppresses SBS. Finally, the degree of freedom for the dithering signal is infinite, with an optical power budget improvement of up to 8 dB at an optical launch power of 10 dBm, which can in turn be used towards connecting multiple relay nodes (RNs) ...|$|R

40|$|Nitrocarburizing {{is a case}} {{hardening}} process which improves the hardness and wear resistance of a component, but results in geometric distortions. Torque converter pistons (automotive component) and Navy C-ring specimens (measuring tool) made from SAE 1010 plain carbon steel {{were used for the}} distortion analysis. Navy C-rings are generally used for studying the dimensional changes of a material before analyzing the dimensional changes of the actual component. Navy C-rings of varying thicknesses were used to analyze the effect of distortions with the change in thickness. Finite element simulations of Navy C-rings and torque converter pistons were developed to study the effect of nitrocarburizing process on distortions. For thinner specimens, the predicted distortions compare favorably with the experimental values. However, the thicker C-ring specimens showed high prediction error. To better understand the prediction difference of the different C-rings and TC pistons, an empirical ratio (bulk volume to nitrocarburized volume (V/VN)) was introduced. The V/VN ratio will not only help to separate the nitrocarburized surface dominant and bulk dominant specimens, but also provide a better comparison of the C-ring size with the actual component. The reduction of bulk volume to nitrocarburized volume (V/VN) ratio led to a decrease in both the C-ring’s inner diameter (ID) and gap <b>width</b> (GW) <b>distortion,</b> and a small increase in outer diameter (OD) distortion. A composition-depth profile simulation model was also developed to predict the local distortion due to nitrocarburized phases. The local distortion results showed that the γ′-phase (Fe 4 N) in the diffusion zone dominates the overall magnitude of distortion. The residual stress distribution for 1 -step nitrocarburizing treatment was successfully modeled and validated against the experimental stress. The surface stress for one-step nitrocarburizing treatment was found to be tensile in nature. This tensile (surface) residual stress was further reduced by introducing 2 -step nitrocarburizing treatments. Using the nitrogen profile model for 2 -step nitrocarburizing, {{it was found that the}} additional γ′-Fe 4 N phase at the surface resulted in a notable residual (tensile) stress reduction. Also, the simulated 2 -step nitrocarburizing treatments produced a same level of distortion as 1 -step nitrocarburizing treatments. Therefore, the proposed 2 -step nitrocarburizing treatments could potentially improve both the surface quality and fatigue resistance...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} spectrum of a spontaneous otoacoustic emission (SOAE) recording may contain multiple narrow peaks. These peaks correspond to multiple SOAEs emitted by the inner ear. The individual SOAEs exhibit small amplitude fluctuations. The {{correlation between the}} amplitude fluctuations of multiple SOAEs in an individual ear was studied in 19 SOAE recordings from humans. For 424 pairs of SOAEs, the normalized amplitude cross-correlation function was computed. Significant correlation was found in 63 pairs (15 %) : 34 pairs showed positive and 29 pairs showed negative correlation. Some SOAE pairs {{were part of an}} equally spaced triplet of emission peaks, with one SOAE apparently generated as a distortion product of the other two "primary" SOAEs. The occurrence of correlation between a distortion product SOAE and a "primary" SOAE was 56 %. This is significantly higher than the occurrence of correlation for the entire set of SOAE pairs. In addition, the spectral <b>width</b> of the <b>distortion</b> product SOAE was correlated with the spectral width of the "primary" SOAEs (R = 0. 87, p < 10 (- 6)). For 79 % of the correlated SOAE pairs, the cross-correlation function peaked at positive time delay. This indicates that for these pairs the fluctuation of the lower frequency emission lagged the fluctuation of the higher frequency emission. The average peak delay was 11. 0 ms (s. d. 22. 1 ms). The results demonstrate that interactions between SOAEs in an individual ear frequently occur and are asymmetrical. (C) 1998 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R
