5|$|The warriors {{retreated to}} Prophetstown where, {{according}} to one chief's account, the warriors confronted Tenskwatawa. They accused him of deceit because of the many deaths, which his spells <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> prevented. He blamed his wife for desecrating his magic medicine and offered to cast a new spell; he insisted that the warriors launch a second attack, but they refused.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, 2007, six AGM-129 ACM cruise missiles, each {{loaded with}} a W80-1 {{variable}} yield nuclear warhead, were mistakenly loaded onto a United States Air Force (USAF) B-52H heavy bomber at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and transported to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The nuclear warheads in the missiles <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been removed before the missiles {{were taken from}} their storage bunker. The missiles with the nuclear warheads were not reported missing, and remained mounted to the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for 36 hours. During this period, the warheads were not protected by the various mandatory security precautions for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|The Bundeswehr {{gave the}} {{remaining}} border guards and other ex-NVA soldiers {{the task of}} clearing the fortifications, which was completed only in 1994. The scale of the task was immense, involving both the clearing of the fortifications and the rebuilding of hundreds of roads and railway lines. A serious complication was the presence of mines along the border. Although the 1.4million mines laid by the GDR <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been removed during the 1980s, {{it turned out that}} 34,000 were unaccounted for. A further 1,100mines were found and removed following reunification at a cost of more than DM250million, in a programme that was not concluded until the end of 1995.|$|E

5|$|This {{station was}} not {{intended}} to be the terminus of the Concourse Line or the D train; both tracks <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been extended east past Bronx Park and the IRT White Plains Road Line along Burke Avenue to serve the northeast section of the Bronx. This idea was postponed due to lack of funding, and ultimately abandoned when the City of New York bought the right-of-way of the bankrupt New York, Westchester and Boston Railway and converted it for subway use in 1941. Another proposal in the 1970s involved extending the Concourse Line to White Plains Road, but financial troubles caused the plan to be aborted.|$|E
5|$|At 05:45, Lieutenant-Colonel Mehmet Sefik of the Turkish 27th Infantry Regiment {{received}} {{orders to}} move his 1st and 3rd Battalions {{to the west and}} support the 2nd Battalion around Gaba Tepe. The two battalions were already assembled, having spent that night carrying out military exercises. They could not be sent to Ari Burnu as it was not marked on the Turkish maps. Colonel Halil Sami, commanding the 9th Division, also ordered the division's machine-gun company and an artillery battery to move in support of the 27th Infantry Regiment, followed soon after by an 77mm artillery battery. At 08:00 Lieutenant-Colonel Mustafa Kemal, commanding the 19th Division, was ordered to send a battalion to support them. Kemal instead decided to go himself with the 57th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battery towards Chunuk Bair, which he realised was the key point in the defence; whoever held those heights would dominate the battlefield. By chance, the 57th Infantry <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been on an exercise that morning around Hill 971 and had been prepared since 05:30, waiting for orders.|$|E
5|$|By tradition, Anna {{is said to}} {{have had}} a fourth daughter, Wihtburh, an abbess at Dereham (or {{possibly}} West Dereham), where there was a royal double monastery. She may never have existed: Bede fails to mention her and she first appears in a calendar in the late 10th century Bosworth Psalter. She may have been a character specifically created by the religious community at Ely, where her remains <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been taken after being stolen from Dereham and subsequently used as visual proof of the incorruptibility of a saint's body, a substitute for her sister Æthelthryth, whose body had to remain unexamined in her tomb. Manuscript F of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which dates from about 1100, mentions Wihtburh's death when it records that her body was found uncorrupted in 798, 55 years after she died. The resulting date for her death of 743 is too far too late for her to have been a sister of Æthelthryth, who was born in 636.|$|E

5|$|On 19 November 1940, a {{train with}} workers from Trondheim {{to the airport}} {{collided}} with the local train from Kopperå just east of Hommelvik Station. The Hommelvik train disaster killed 22 people. The trains <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> passed at Homnmelvik Station, but the engineer thought {{he had seen the}} other train, and had left the station. The accident occurred at 08:03, and was caused by there being virtually no light to see with, since all outdoor sources of light were covered. On 23 January 1941, a coke and coal train from Sweden lost its braking between the border and Kopperå. The six back cars plus the caboose derailed just west of Kopperå Station, while the locomotive and 17 other trains continued their wild flight. The train derailed at Meråker Station, and the Meråker train disaster killed both the engineer and the stoker.|$|E
5|$|When Borah went to Washington for the Senate's regular {{session in}} December 1907, he was {{immediately}} {{a figure of}} note, {{not only for the}} dramatic events in Idaho, but for keeping his Western habits, including wearing a ten-gallon hat. It was then the custom that junior senators wait perhaps a year before giving their maiden speech, but at Roosevelt's request, in April 1908, Borah spoke in defense of the president's dismissal of over a hundred African American soldiers in the Brownsville Affair, their cause pressed by the fiery Ohio senator, Joseph B. Foraker. The soldiers <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> shot up a Texas town, and Borah stated that their alleged actions were as wrongful as the murder of Steunenberg. The accusations were later deemed to be motivated by racism, and in 1972, long after the deaths of Roosevelt, Borah, and most of the soldiers, the dismissals were reversed.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{to build}} an {{interchange}} connecting to {{the north end of}} I-476 (the Blue Route) were made; the turnpike commission approved a contract to build the interchange in March 1989. That June, a losing bidder decided to challenge the turnpike commission, saying it violated female and minority contracting rules regarding the percentage of these employees that were used for the project. Under this rule, bidders <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> at least 12 percent of contracts to minority-owned companies and at least 4 percent to female-owned companies. The losing bidder had 12.4 percent of the contracts to minority companies and 4.2 percent to female-owned companies while the winning bidder had 6.1 percent and 3.7 percent respectively. The turnpike commission decided to rebid the contract, but was sued by the original contractor. This dispute delayed the construction of the interchange. The contract was rebid in November 1989 after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court permitted it. The interchange between I-476 and the turnpike mainline was completed in November 1992; the ramps to the Northeast Extension opened a month later. An official ribbon-cutting took place on December 15, 1992.|$|E

25|$|At {{this period}} the {{compounds}} employed in medicine were often heterogeneous mixtures, {{some of which}} contained from 20 to 70, or more, ingredients, while {{a large number of}} simples were used in consequence of the same substance being supposed to possess different qualities according to the source from which it was derived. Thus crabs’ eyes (i.e., gastroliths), pearls, oyster shells, and coral <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> different properties. Among other ingredients entering into some of these formulae were the excrements of human beings, dogs, mice, geese, and other animals, calculi, human skull, and moss growing on it, blind puppies, earthworms, etc.|$|E
25|$|On 25 December 2011, it was {{reported}} that three commandos who sustained moderate and serious injuries had still not been recognized as disabled veterans and granted state benefits. The Ministry of Defense demanded that additional proof of injury be produced, though its rehabilitation wing had already made a preliminary decision to grant them disability status. The commandos filed a lawsuit against the Defense Ministry, and hired private attorneys. A source close to the proceedings told Ynet that the soldiers <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> received their benefits three or four months after the proceedings began, especially with the photographs and video footage that documented the incident.|$|E
