25|$|As Mayor of San Francisco, Brown {{was often}} portrayed mockingly but affectionately by {{political}} cartoonists and columnists as a vain emperor, presiding in a robe and crown over the inconsequential kingdom of San Francisco.

She {{immediately}} began appearing on, and eventually producing, segments of the popular national CBC Radio program Morningside, where she usually paired with host Don Harron for free-wheeling discussions of favourite old comic strips and other pop culture.

25|$|Preparatory {{to writing}} Pharaoh, Prus {{immersed}} himself in ancient Egyptian history, geography, customs, religion, art and writings. In the course of telling his story of power, personality, and the fates of nations, he produced a compelling literary depiction of life {{at every level of}} ancient Egyptian society.

25|$|Smith {{has been}} {{creating}} complicated abstract paintings and litographs since the 1970s. She employs {{a wide variety}} of media, working in painting, printmaking and richly textured mixed media pieces. Such images and collage elements as commercial slogans, sign-like petroglyphs, rough drawing, and the inclusion and layering of text are unusually intersected into a complex vision created out of the artist’s personal experience. Her works contain strong, insistent socio-political commentary that speaks to past and present cultural appropriation and abuse, while identifying the continued significance of the Native American peoples. She addresses today’s tribal politics, human rights and environmental issues <b>with</b> <b>humor.</b> Smith is known internationally for her philosophically centered work regarding her strong traditional beliefs and political activism.|$|E
25|$|The primetime {{soap operas}} and drama {{series of the}} 1990s, such as Beverly Hills, 90210, Melrose Place, Party of Five, The OC, and Dawson's Creek, focused more on younger characters. In the 2000s, ABC began to revitalize the primetime soap opera format with shows such as Desperate Housewives, Grey's Anatomy, Brothers & Sisters, Ugly Betty, Private Practice, and more {{recently}} Revenge, Nashville, Scandal, Mistresses, and formerly Ringer, which its sister production company ABC Studios co-produced with CBS Television Studios for The CW. While not soaps in the traditional sense, these shows managed to appeal to wide audiences with their high drama mixed <b>with</b> <b>humor,</b> and are soap operas by definition. These successes led to NBC's launching serials, including Heroes and Friday Night Lights. The upstart MyNetworkTV, a sister network of Fox, launched a line of primetime telenovelas (a genre similar to soap operas in terms of content) upon its launch in September 2006, but discontinued its use of the format in 2007, after disappointing ratings.|$|E

25|$|The series, {{particularly}} {{the first two}} films, has received significant critical acclaim. Scream has been credited with revitalizing the horror genre in the late 1990s by combining a traditional slasher film <b>with</b> <b>humor,</b> awareness of horror film clichés and a clever plot. Scream {{was one of the}} highest-grossing films of 1996 and became the highest-grossing slasher film in the world, an honor it still holds. Its success was matched by Scream 2, which not only broke box-office records of the time but was also considered superior to the original by some critics. Scream 3 fared worse than its predecessors, both critically and financially, with critics commenting that it had become the type of horror film it originally parodied in Scream. It did, however, receive some positive response, with claims that it was the perfect end to the trilogy. The film series has been the recipient of several awards, including a Saturn Award for Best Actress and MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance for Campbell and a Saturn Award for Best Horror Film for Scream.|$|E

500|$|Calleia excelled as {{the villain}} in films, {{but he wanted}} to create {{characters}} with some sympathy. [...] "I'd like to get away from straight villain roles," [...] he said in a 1936 interview. [...] "But I have no wish to be a hero. I enjoy roles where I get slapped around a bit. It's far more stimulating to play a character that isn't all one thing—not all bad and not all good." [...] He created a series of darkly mysterious characters edged <b>with</b> <b>humor</b> in films including Algiers (1938), Five Came Back (1939), Golden Boy (1939), The Glass Key (1942) and Gilda (1946).|$|E

500|$|Holmes, {{an outspoken}} critic of over-sentimental Transcendentalist and Romantic poetry, often slipped into sentimentality when writing his {{occasional}} poetry, but would often balance such emotional excess <b>with</b> <b>humor.</b> Critic George Warren Arms believed Holmes's poetry to be provincial in nature, noting his [...] "New England homeliness" [...] and [...] "Puritan familiarity with household detail" [...] as proof. In his poetry, Holmes often connected the theme of nature to human relations and social teachings; poems such as [...] "The Ploughman" [...] and [...] "The New Eden", which were delivered in commemoration of Pittsfield's scenic countryside, were even quoted in the 1863 edition of the Old Farmer's Almanac.|$|E
500|$|The film {{is part of}} a {{genre of}} comedy horror films {{inspired}} by 1920s Broadway stage plays.
