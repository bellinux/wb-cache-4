The aim was {{to find out the}} pattern of eye disorders affecting primary school children in Kaduna North metropolis and to offer treatment to those with treatable disorders. Method: A total of 2, 397 pupils whose classes ranged from primary one to six and aged between five to eighteen years were examined. Results: Of this number, 1, 232 (51. 57 %) were males and 1, 161 (48. 43 %). The commonest causes of eye disorders <b>were</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> (14. 5 %), refractive error (1. 7 %), and infective conjunctivitis (1. 4 %). Conclusion: School eye screening visits should be {{at least once a year}} and should involve screening of all nursery one and primary one pupils. School teachers can be trained to measure visual acuity. Primary eye care workers may be trained and utilised to carrying out school screening in schools, while basic eye health classes can be taught in ante-natal classes to enlighten mothers who are the primary care givers.

40|$|The {{history of}} {{allergic}} disease {{goes back to}} 1819, when Bostock described his own ‘periodical affection of the eyes and chest’, which he called ‘summer catarrh’. Since {{they thought it was}} produced by the effluvium of new hay, this condition was also called hay fever. Later, in 1873, Blackley established that pollen {{played an important role in}} the causation of hay fever. Nowadays, the definition of allergy is ‘An untoward physiologic event mediated by a variety of different immunologic reactions’. In this review, the term allergy will be restricted to the IgE-dependent reactions. The most important clinical manifestations of IgE-dependent reactions <b>are</b> <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis,</b> <b>allergic</b> rhinitis, allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis. However, this review will <b>be</b> restricted to <b>allergic</b> rhinitis. The histopathological features of allergic inflammation involve an increase in blood flow and vascular permeability, leading to plasma exudation and the formation of oedema. In addition, a cascade of events occurs which involves a variety of inflammatory cells. These inflammatory cells migrate under the influence of chemotactic agents to the site of injury and induce the process of repair. Several types of inflammatory cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis. After specific or nonspecific stimuli, inflammatory mediators are generated from cells normally found in the nose, such as mast cells, antigen-presenting cells and epithelial cells (primary effector cells) and from cells recruited into the nose, such as basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, platelets and neutrophils (secondary effector cells). This review describes the identification of each of the inflammatory cells and their mediators which play a role in the perennial allergic processes in the nose of rhinitis patients...|$|R

We report an exceptional case of bilateral iridoschisis occurring in conjunction with keratoconus and severe allergic eye disease. Case Presentation A 24 -year-old white man had had periocular contact dermatitis and allergic eye disease {{from the age of}} 3 years. He <b>was</b> <b>allergic</b> to grass, animal hair, and pollen and worked grooming horses. He compulsively rubbed his eyes. There was no history of previous blunt trauma to either eye.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the development and mechanism(s) of allergic diseases has changed dramatically over the last 20 years. With the advent of genetic studies it has now become clear that the linear model, {{as defined by the}} <b>allergic</b> march, <b>is</b> no longer tenable. Instead, we must consider all allergies as complex multi-compartment models in which genes which control IgE production and also genes which govern other aspects of allergic disease, such as epithelium integrity, both play an important role. To explore such possibilities, this chapter asks four questions: 1. Is there any evidence of an abnormality in the conjunctival or nasal mucosa which would allow increased allergen penetration? Epithelial changes which are likely to facilitate allergen penetration are present in both <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> and rhinitis, but they appear different. For example, epithelial PAR- 2 expression <b>is</b> elevated in <b>allergic</b> rhinitis whereas in seasonal <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis,</b> many structural proteins, including E-cadherin, CD 44, desmosomes, keratins K 5 / 6, K 7, K 8, K 13, K 14, K 18 and PAR- 2 are all reduced. 2. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> known about the immunology of sensitization in <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> and <b>allergic</b> rhinitis? Clearly, great strides are being made with respect to the biology of dendritic cells and T regulatory cells and to the possibility of local IgE production, but there is little evidence to suggest differences between the mechanisms of sensitization in the eye and nose. 3. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> the pattern of mediator release in the immediate allergic response and the development of allergic inflammation in <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> and <b>allergic</b> rhinitis? The pattern of the early phase allergic response in the eye and nose seem similar. While an eosinophil dominated late phase response and <b>allergic</b> inflammation <b>are</b> present in <b>allergic</b> rhinitis, they <b>are</b> only present in the more severe forms of <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> such as AKC and VKC. 4. Is there any evidence for clinically relevant persistent inflammation or organ remodelling in <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> and <b>allergic</b> rhinitis? A sustained inflammation and tissue remodelling are well established in the lower airways in asthma where they contribute significantly to the symptoms. However, in upper airways, although there do appear to be functional changes in sensory neurone structure and function in the nose during prolonged allergen exposure, tissue damage seems to be more limited and overt remodelling does not appear to occur in <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> and <b>is</b> questionable in <b>allergic</b> rhinitis...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that natural killer (NK) cells exert effector/regulatory {{properties}} on both innate and adaptive responses via release of different cytokines. While some information indicates NK cells in allergic asthma and atopic dermatitis, no data <b>are</b> available for <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate NK in the blood and the conjunctiva of patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). METHODS: Six patients with active VKC and six healthy subjects were included in the study. Blood samples and conjunctival biopsies were taken from each patient. NK cells in blood and conjunctiva were quantified by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Clinical findings of the patients were recorded, conjunctival immune infiltrates were characterized, and both parameters were correlated to NK cell number. RESULTS: Compared to healthy subjects, NK cells were significantly decreased in the blood and increased in the conjunctiva of patients with VKC. CONCLUSIONS: Together with lymphocytes, eosinophils, and mast cells, NK cells constitute a significant proportion of the immune cells infiltrating VKC conjunctiva. This finding indicates a potential role of NK and innate immunity in the regulation of allergic reactions and in diseases such as VKC. New therapeutic alternatives for modulating allergic inflammation might target NK cells...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{characterize}} the transcriptome of <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> mediated by eosinophil-related chemokine receptor CCR 3 {{and to identify}} a candidate for possible therapeutic intervention in eosinophilic inflammation of the eye. METHODS. Mice were sensitized to ragweed pollen, and <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> <b>was</b> induced by an allergen challenge. The induction of <b>allergic</b> <b>conjunctivitis</b> <b>was</b> used to determine whether an inhibition of CCR 3 would suppress eosinophilic inflammation and the allergen-induced immediate hypersensitivity reaction. In addition, sensitized mice were treated with a CCR 3 antagonist or an anti–CCR 3 antibody before the allergen challenge. Eosinophilic inflammation was evaluated histologically at 24 hours after the allergen challenge. Transcriptional changes {{with or without a}} blockade of CCR 3 were determined by microarray analyses. RESULTS. Blockade of CCR 3 significantly suppressed allergeninduce...|$|R
