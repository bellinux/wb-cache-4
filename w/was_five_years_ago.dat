40|$|Hello! This is Connie Reimers-Hild {{with the}} University of Nebraska-Lincoln Extension at the Kimmel Education and Research Center in Nebraska City, NE {{and host of}} the {{television}} show Market Journal with your Extension Update. Today, I am going to update you {{on some of the}} results of the well-being section of the 2011 Nebraska Rural Poll. This particular section of the poll will detail the 2, 490 responses from the 2011 Poll. With all the negativity these days, I get to be the bearer of positive news, which is great! The 2011 Rural Poll found that most rural Nebraskans believe they are better off than they <b>were</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Over one‐half (52 %) of rural Nebraskans believe they are better off than they <b>were</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> up from 50 percent last year. This represents the second highest proportion of persons believing they are better off compared to <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> in the study’s history (behind 53 % occurring in 2008). This is a really interesting finding considering the state of the economy...|$|R

In Utopia, however, they will conduct research by the army corps while we conduct it--we don't conduct it! We let it happen.

40|$|The EU {{relies heavily}} on imports to meet its demand for natural gas. Nearly 23 % of the gas burned by the EU member states is {{produced}} in Russian gas fields. Ukraine {{remains one of the}} main supply routes for Russian gas flowing into Europe. Consequently, mounting tensions between Russia and Ukraine concerning the Crimean Peninsula brought back memories of past gas supply disruptions, most notably of 2009. The question today is whether the EU in 2014 is equally vulnerable to potential (forced or voluntary) cuts in Russian gas supplies as it <b>was</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> In this commentary, Arno Behrens and Julian Wieczorkiewicz look into two different scenarios. First, could Europe sustain longer cuts in gas supplies from Russia? And second, what impact would disruptions of Russian gas deliveries to Ukraine have on the EU? Essentially the authors argue that Russia is highly dependent on gas exports to Europe, while Europe could resort to alternatives to Russian gas. In addition, Europe is much better prepared for potential short-term supply disruptions than it <b>was</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago...</b>|$|E

While few doubt that published tuition rates (sticker price) have been increasing at alarming rates, it is often argued that "net tuition," or the out of pocket expense, for students is much lower because of financial aid. This report shows that with few exceptions, financial aid has not increased sufficiently to offset increases in published tuition.
