2500|$|Conservative Judaism {{has largely}} ignored this {{practice}} in the past, but recently has begun to reevaluate its silence {{in this area and}} to consider the spiritual implications of mikvah immersion for human sexuality and for women. Jews-by-choice tend to recall the mikvah ceremony as an experience of heightened spirituality, leaving a permanent mark on their religious awareness. Some comments I have received about the mikvah include: [...] "It made me feel closer to God"; [...] "An emotional highlight of my life"; [...] "When I came up from the waters all was quiet, my eyes <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>cry.</b> My soul was still...I am still in a state of peacefulness and love fills me"...These observations, written by converts to Judaism several weeks after the event, reflect the powerful impact of the mikvah ritual on Jews-by-choice and the profound importance they attach to its spiritual significance.|$|E
