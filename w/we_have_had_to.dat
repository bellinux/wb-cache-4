500|$|Colonel Powell's wound {{received}} at Wytheville was {{judged to be}} fatal by surgeons for both the Union and Confederate armies. When the Union army departed from Wytheville, Powell was left behind with other wounded soldiers {{who could not be}} moved. These men became prisoners of the Confederacy. The citizens of Wytheville blamed Powell for the burning of many of the community's homes. For his own safety, Powell was hidden. Confederate General Sam Jones wanted Powell held accountable for the burning of two buildings from an earlier raid, and added that Powell was [...] "...one of the most dangerous officers <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> contend with..." [...] Surprisingly, Powell recovered enough from his wound that he was moved to a Richmond prison. While in captivity there, he was fed only bread and water, and slept on the floor. Lieutenant Colonel David Dove, who was recovering from a severe wound suffered earlier in the year, returned to camp in October. During Powell's absence, Dove was in command of the regiment.|$|E

[...] For his own safety, Powell was hidden. Several local women were instrumental in preventing retaliation on the blue-coated prisoners. Powell unexpectedly healed, and was eventually moved to Richmond's Libby Prison where he survived for a portion of that time in a dungeon on a bread and water diet. He was exchanged for Colonel Richard H. Lee in early February 1864, and returned to the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry during March 1864.

Seven months before Lamont made the statement, inflation (as measured by the annual change in the Retail Price Index) reached 10.9%. In May 1991, inflation fell to 6.4%. A year after the Major government was reelected in the 1992 general election, winning the most votes of any political party in British electoral history, inflation fell to 4.3%, falling to 1.3% a year later.

[...] The commissioner also added: [...] "Once the bridges have been burned and people get turned off on a sports franchise, years of loyalty is not respected and it is difficult to get it back. By the same token, there are millions of fans in that area who have supported the Rams in an extraordinary way. The Rams have 50 years of history and the last 5 or so years of difficult times can be corrected." ...|$|E

In his summing up on 22 April Lord Dyson said that it was [...] "most unfortunate" [...] Sandiford required [...] "relatively speaking ... very small sum indeed" [...] for her legal costs, but that this [...] "cannot affect the principle that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> consider and it cannot affect our decision.

In the written judgement, Lord Dyson said that Sandiford had argued the Foreign Secretary's position was [...] "unlawful" [...] but that the High Court had been [...] "right to conclude" [...] it was not. [...] "As the Secretary of State concedes, it would be possible to produce a policy under which funds for legal representation were made available to British nationals in certain defined circumstances...But the question is not whether the Secretary of State could produce a different policy which many would regard as fairer and more reasonable and humane than the present policy. It is whether the policy that he has produced is irrational. I am in no doubt that the policy is not irrational.
