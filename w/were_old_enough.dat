In 1947, when the children <b>were</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to attend boarding school, the couple returned to Singapore, both working at Raffles College. In 1952, the couple moved to Ibadan, Nigeria, both accepting posts at University College Ibadan. Norman became the Chair of Physics, whilst Elizabeth took {{on the role of}} Lecturer in Soil Sciences. She worked in Agronomy, soil science, and administration. The university opened a department of geology in 1958 and appointed Dr. Elizabeth Alexander Senior Lecturer and Head of Department. Just three weeks into her new role, Alexander suffered a stroke and she died a week later on 15 October 1958 at the age of 49.|$|E
5|$|An 18th-century account {{suggests}} that females {{might have left}} their newborn calves in isolation and returned regularly to suckle them until the calves <b>were</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to join herds, {{which is similar to}} the behaviour of roan and sable antelopes. Akin to other grazing antelopes, the bluebuck probably calved mainly where rainfall, and thus the availability of grasses, peaked. Such locations could be the western margin of the CFR during winter and the eastern margin of the CFR during summer. Faith et al. 2013 found that the occurrence of juveniles in bluebuck fossils decreases linearly from the west to the east, indicating that most births took place in the western CFR; due to the preference for rainfall, it may be further assumed that most births occurred during winter, when the western CFR receives most of its rainfall. The annual west-to-east migration would have followed in summer, consistent with the greater number of adult juveniles in the east that would have joined herds. Juvenile fossils also occur in other places across the range, but appear to be concentrated in the western CFR.|$|E

5|$|The C5's {{users were}} an eclectic group.

Clarke, who had two shipped out to his home at Colombo in Sri Lanka; and the Mayor of Scarborough, Michael Pitts, who swapped his official Daimler for a C5. However, as The Times reported, {{some of the early}} buyers were disappointed by the vehicle's limitations, citing its slowness, its limited range and its inability to cope with steep hills, which led some people to return their C5s and ask for a refund.|$|E

25|$|The {{necessity}} and inerrancy were well-established ideas, garnering little criticism, though they later came under debate from outside during the Enlightenment. The most contentious {{idea at the}} time though was the notion that anyone could simply pick up the Bible and learn enough to gain salvation. Though the reformers were concerned with ecclesiology (the doctrine of how the church as a body works), they had a different understanding of the process in which truths in scripture were applied to life of believers, compared to the Catholics' idea that certain people within the church, or ideas that <b>were</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough,</b> had a special status in giving understanding of the text.|$|E

The influence of this school was to them both a lasting benefit. On the return of the two sisters from Lenox, their pastor Rev. Abiel Abbott Livermore and his wife were invited to make the Perry family mansion their home. Lowe occupied her leisure with riding, driving, and singing. After a year at home, she went to Boston, to take piano lessons. Her first winter was spent with the family of Mrs. George Bond, one of the ladies of Boston society. Her second winter in Boston was devoted to lessons in singing, and she stayed in the home of Dr. and Mrs. Henry I. Bowditch.|$|E

He also said that if he <b>were</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to vote in the 2012 presidential election, he would vote for Barack Obama. However, he refused to describe himself as liberal, instead rejecting ideological labels entirely. Krohn attributes his change to reading works of philosophers such as Nietzsche and Wittgenstein.

In an interview with The New York Post following the film's release, Baker commented on her role, saying: [...] "It's an important movie and I'm honored to be in it.

500|$|By the 1930s, the {{international}} community believed {{that the bulk of}} the Brazilian Navy was [...] "obsolete" [...] and <b>were</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to no longer be [...] "considered effective." [...] Still, Minas Geraes was modernized a second time at the Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard from June 1931 to April 1938. Plans to give similar treatment to São Paulo were dropped due to the ship's poor material condition. During the same period, the Brazilian government looked into purchasing cruisers from the United States Navy but ran into the restrictions of the Washington and London Naval Treaties, which placed restrictions on the sale of used warships to foreign countries. The Brazilians eventually contracted for six destroyers from the United Kingdom. In the interim, a plan to lease six destroyers from the United States was abandoned after it was met with strong opposition from both international and American institutions. Three s, based on the American , were laid down in Brazil with six minelayers, all of which were launched between 1939 and 1941. Though both programs required foreign assistance and were consequently delayed by the war, all nine ships were completed by 1944.|$|E
