5|$|Designed {{within the}} tight 35,000 ton {{limitations}} of the Washington Naval Treaty, wartime service necessitated increases over the design displacement, seriously reducing freeboard and affecting seaworthiness. This was most acute at the already low bow. With too little buoyancy forward the bows were easily buried even in moderate seas, with spray <b>washing</b> <b>up</b> over both forward turrets. Heavy seas could flood ‘A’ turret, drenching both men and machinery within.|$|E

25|$|Blowing bubbles from {{leftover}} <b>washing</b> <b>up</b> soap {{became a}} popular pastime, {{as shown in}} the painting The Soap Bubble (1739) by Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin. Other popular toys included hoops, toy wagons, kites, spinning wheels and puppets. The first board games were produced by John Jefferys in the 1750s, including A Journey Through Europe. The game was very similar to modern board games; players moved along a track with the throw of a dice (a teetotum was actually used) and landing on different spaces would either help or hinder the player.|$|E
25|$|Verbeek {{and others}} believe that the final major Krakatoa {{eruption}} was a lateral blast, or pyroclastic surge (similar to the catastrophic 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens). Around noon on 27 August 1883, a rain of hot ash fell around Ketimbang (now Katibung in Lampung Province) in Sumatra. Approximately 1,000 {{people were killed in}} Sumatra, there were no survivors from the 3,000people located on the island of Sebesi. There are numerous documented reports of groups of human skeletons floating across the Indian Ocean on rafts of volcanic pumice and <b>washing</b> <b>up</b> on the east coast of Africa, up to a year after the eruption.|$|E

There are numerous documented reports of groups of human skeletons floating across the Indian Ocean on rafts of volcanic pumice and <b>washing</b> <b>up</b> on the east coast of Africa up to a year after the eruption. Average global temperatures fell by as much as 1.2degrees Celsius in the year following the eruption.

Between the luggage trucks and trucks carrying the ride organisation equipment, portable toilets, showers, and other requirements, typically between fourteen and forty semi-trailer trucks accompany the ride each day. A number of buses are also used to transport volunteers and other workers around the route, with about 180 other vehicles in total supporting the ride.|$|E
25|$|To {{make matters}} {{easier for the}} youth, however, the Old Man that dwelt in the first cave the youth had {{discovered}} kept track {{of all of the}} youth's money and inventory items so that the youth could recover them again and take up from roughly the same position. Additionally, the Old Man was capable of telepathic communication with the hero and could grant the child magical abilities for short periods of time by researching spells in tomes of forbidden magic. The Old Man's ability to see clairvoyantly also enabled him to sense when certain plot elements were occurring such as the kidnapping of the great fairy or the <b>washing</b> <b>up</b> of useful items by the seashore. These events would be relayed to the hero telepathically.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, Lynch {{had begun to}} work in {{television}} as well as cinema, directing a short piece titled The Cowboy and the Frenchman for French television in 1989. Around this time, he met the television producer Mark Frost, who had formerly worked on such projects as the television police series Hill Street Blues, {{and they decided to}} start working together on a biopic of singer and actress Marilyn Monroe based upon Anthony Summers's book, The Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe. While this project never got off the ground, the duo went on to work on a comedy script named One Saliva Bubble, but that did not see completion either. While they were talking in a coffee shop, Lynch and Frost had the idea of a corpse <b>washing</b> <b>up</b> on the shore of a lake, and subsequently set about on their third project, initially called Northwest Passage but would eventually become the television series Twin Peaks (1990–1991).|$|E

25|$|The alewife {{first entered}} the system west of Lake Ontario via 19th-century canals. By the 1960s, the small silver fish {{had become a}} {{familiar}} nuisance to beach goers across Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Erie. Periodic mass dieoffs result in vast numbers of the fish <b>washing</b> <b>up</b> on shore; estimates by various governments have placed the percentage of Lake Michigan's biomass, which {{was made up of}} alewives in the early 1960s, as high as 90%. In the late 1960s, the various state and federal governments began stocking several species of salmonids, including the native lake trout as well as non-native chinook and coho salmon; by the 1980s, alewife populations had dropped drastically. The ruffe, a small percid fish from Eurasia, became the most abundant fish species in Lake Superior's Saint Louis River within five years of its detection in 1986. Its range, which has expanded to Lake Huron, poses a significant threat to the lower lake fishery. Five years after first being observed in the St. Clair River, the round goby can now be found in all of the Great Lakes. The goby is considered undesirable for several reasons: it preys upon bottom-feeding fish, overruns optimal habitat, spawns multiple times a season, and can survive poor water quality conditions.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon left Boulogne on 27 August, {{bound for}} Aachen {{to visit the}} tomb of Charlemagne, and to see his wife Joséphine. The army {{remained}} encamped outside Boulogne and the British were initially suspicious that his departure was a ruse, {{and that he would}} double back unexpectedly to take command of the army and launch the invasion. In the meantime the frigate HMS Immortalite was sent under the command of Captain Edward Owen to carry out surveys along the French coast around the port. Fulton subsequently pronounced his inventions ready, and an assault was planned for early October. Working at Portsmouth Dockyard Fulton had built several types of craft and explosive devices. The 'torpedo-catamaran' was a coffer-like device balanced on two wooden floats and steered by a man with a paddle. Weighted with lead so as to ride low in the water, the operator was further disguised by wearing dark clothes and a black cap. His task was to approach the French ship, hook the torpedo to the anchor cable and, having activated the device by removing a pin, remove the paddles and escape before the torpedo detonated. Also to be deployed were large numbers of casks filled with gunpowder, ballast and combustible balls. They would float in on the tide and on <b>washing</b> <b>up</b> against an enemy's hull, explode. Also included in the force were several fireships, carrying 40 barrels of gunpowder and rigged to explode by a clockwork mechanism.|$|E

Heavy rains caused mudslides on Saint Kitts, and heavy damage occurred in Old Road Town. Damage in the country amounted to $41.4million. In Montserrat, damage was reported along its western coastline. After high waves capsized a boat, a crew of three required rescue. Guadeloupe received record precipitation amounts in some areas, generally ranging from [...] On Grande-Terre, the eastern island of Guadeloupe, the hurricane produced a significant wave height of , with estimates as high as [...] The extent of damage was from waves in the western portion of the island and from unrelated flooding inland.

500|$|The novel depicts Howl's castle as a tall, {{dark and}} {{sinister}} wizard's tower, {{very different from}} the complex image in the film. The film's castle may be seen as a parody of the machines seen in the movie, driven both by steam-engines and by magic. In the film, it is a [...] "rotund collage of chimneys, roofs, steam pipes, and other odd appendages, borne along on mechanized bird legs" [...] that is similar to Baba Yaga's hut in the popular fairy tale. It is vaguely organic, and almost depicted as a life-form. Similarly, Calcifer is a demonic figure in the book, as compared to the [...] "endearing" [...] persona and image that he has in the film. Both film and novel try to render fantastic elements as mundane and ordinary things. Although they are set in a fantasy universe, the characters are often shown performing routine tasks, like cooking breakfast or <b>washing</b> <b>up,</b> in contrast to the heroic actions typical of a fantasy universe. In the novel, Jones disrupts the fantasy-world setting by including scenes in which the characters travel to the real-world Wales. The movie, however, avoids this digression, and maintains a constant setting.|$|E
500|$|In 1812, a Siamese-supported young {{brother of}} Ang Chan, the King of Cambodia, rose up and seized the throne, which forced the {{incumbent}} {{to flee to}} Gia Định. In 1813, Duyệt, {{with the approval of}} Gia Long, entered Cambodia with an army of 10,000 troops and forced the Siamese army to retreat. He reinstated Ang Chan and built two citadels, Nam Vang and La Liem on Cambodian territory in order to maintain Vietnamese jurisdiction over the nation, which was formally made a protectorate, adding to his prestige. In addition, Duyet's domestic governance was effective and stabilized the south, which prompted the people to give him the sobriquet Cọp Gấm Đồng Nai ("White Tiger of Đồng Nai"). [...] As Gia Long's most trusted mandarin, Duyệt often acted as a conduit between the emperor and the European merchants and government delegates who visited Vietnam. In the early 1820s, Duyet dispatched a delegation to seek out British officials in an attempt to buy arms, but the party got lost in storms and were arrested after <b>washing</b> <b>up</b> in Burma. Duyet remained an advocate of hawkish foreign policy after the protectorate over Cambodia was entrenched, advocating an alliance with Burma against Siam, and expressing confidence that Vietnam could defeat Siam and dominate Southeast Asia.|$|E
