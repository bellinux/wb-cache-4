5000|$|On 28 April 2017 WikiLeaks {{published}} Vault 7 part 7 [...] "Scribbles". The leak includes {{documentation and}} source code of a tool intended to track documents leaked to whistleblowers and journalists by embedding <b>web</b> <b>beacon</b> tags into classified documents to trace exactly who leaked the documents.|$|E
50|$|A <b>web</b> <b>beacon</b> is any of {{a number}} of {{techniques}} used to track who is reading a web page or email, when, and from which computer. They {{can also be used to}} see if an email was read or forwarded to someone else, or if a web page was copied to another website. The first web beacons were small images.|$|E
5000|$|Google Analytics is {{implemented}} with [...] "page tags", in this case, called the Google Analytics Tracking Code, {{which is a}} snippet of JavaScript code that the website owner adds to every page of the website. The tracking code runs in the client browser when the client browses the page (if JavaScript is enabled in the browser) and collects visitor data and sends it to a Google data collection server {{as part of a}} request for a <b>web</b> <b>beacon.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{an example}} of the way <b>web</b> <b>beacons</b> can make user logging easier, {{consider}} a company that owns a network of sites. This company may have a network that requires all images to be stored on one host computer while the pages themselves are stored elsewhere. They could use <b>web</b> <b>beacons</b> in order to count and recognize users traveling around the different servers on the network. Rather than gathering statistics and managing cookies on all their servers separately, they can use <b>web</b> <b>beacons</b> to keep them all together.|$|R
50|$|Text-based mail readers (such as Pine or Mutt) and {{graphical}} email {{clients with}} purely text-based HTML capabilities (such as Mulberry) do not interpret HTML or display images, so their users {{are not subject}} to tracking by email <b>web</b> <b>beacons.</b> Plain-text email messages cannot contain <b>web</b> <b>beacons</b> because their contents are interpreted as display characters instead of embedded HTML code, so opening messages does not initiate communication. Some email clients offer the option to disable all HTML in every message (thus rendering all messages as plain text), which prevents any <b>web</b> <b>beacons</b> from loading.|$|R
50|$|Many modern email {{readers and}} web-based email {{services}} will not load images when opening an HTML email from an unknown sender or that is suspected to be spam mail. The user must explicitly choose to load images. <b>Web</b> <b>beacons</b> {{can also be}} filtered out at the server level so that they never reach the end user. MailScanner {{is an example of}} gateway software that can disarm IFrames as well as <b>web</b> <b>beacons.</b> Disconnecting from the Internet before reading any downloaded messages and then deleting those messages suspected of containing <b>web</b> <b>beacons</b> before reconnecting may also eliminate the threat.|$|R
50|$|Ad-Aware was {{originally}} developed in 1999 to highlight web beacons inside of Internet Explorer. On many websites, users {{would see a}} tiny pixelated square next to each <b>web</b> <b>beacon,</b> warning the user that the computer's IP address and other non-essential information was being tracked by this website. Over time, Ad-Aware added the ability to block those beacons, or ads. Ad-Aware no longer makes the user aware of the ads on the screen; instead the program fights spyware, adware, viruses and other malware.|$|E
50|$|Web beacons {{embedded}} in emails have greater privacy implications than beacons {{embedded in}} web pages. Through {{the use of}} unique identifiers contained in the URL of the web beacons, the sender of an email containing a <b>web</b> <b>beacon</b> is able to record the exact time that a message was read, {{as well as the}} IP address of the computer used to read the mail or the proxy server that the user went through. In this way, the sender can gather detailed information about when and where each particular recipient reads email. Every subsequent time the email message is displayed can also send information back to the sender.|$|E
50|$|Originally, a <b>web</b> <b>beacon</b> {{was a small}} (usually 1&times;1 pixel) {{transparent}} GIF or PNG image (or {{an image}} of the same color as the background) that was embedded in an HTML page, usually a page on the web or the content of an email. Modern web beacons also use the HTML IFrame, style, script, input link, embed, object, and other tags to track usage. Whenever a user opens a page with a graphic browser or email reader, such image and other information is downloaded. This download requires the browser to send a request to the server storing that image or information, allowing the organization running that server {{to keep track of the}} HTML page.|$|E
50|$|Disposition-Notification-To email headers {{may be seen}} {{as another}} form of <b>web</b> <b>beacons.</b> See RFC 4021.|$|R
5000|$|While <b>web</b> <b>beacons</b> {{are used}} in the same way in web pages or emails, they have {{different}} purposes: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Web</b> <b>beacons</b> {{can be used}} in {{combination}} with HTTP cookies like any other object transferred using the HTTP protocol.|$|R
50|$|The Beacon API is a newer {{technique}} {{which does}} not require the use of invisible images or similar tactics. It is a candidate recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium, the standards organization for the web. It is designed to allow web developers to track the activity of users, by sending information (such as analytics or diagnostic data) back to the web server once the user navigates away from the page. Use of the <b>web</b> <b>beacon</b> API allows tracking without interfering with or delaying navigation away from the site, and is invisible to the end-user. Support for the Beacon API was introduced into Mozilla's Firefox browser in February 2014 and in Google's Chrome browser in November 2014.|$|E
50|$|Some email {{marketing}} tools include tracking as a feature. Such email tracking {{is usually}} accomplished using standard web tracking devices known as cookies and web beacons. When an email message is sent, {{if it is}} a graphical HTML message (not a plain text message) the email marketing system may embed a tiny, invisible tracking image (a single-pixel gif, sometimes called a <b>web</b> <b>beacon)</b> within the content of the message. When the recipient opens the message, the tracking image is referenced. When they click a link or open an attachment, another tracking code is activated. In each case a separate tracking event is recorded by the system. These response events accumulate over time in a database, enabled the email marketing software to report metrics such as open-rate and click-through rates. Email marketing users can view reports on both aggregate response statistics and individual response over time.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Web</b> <b>beacon</b> is a {{term used}} for various {{techniques}} used on web pages or email, to unobtrusively (usually invisibly) allows checking that a user has accessed the content. Common uses are email tracking and page tagging for web analytics. Alternative names are web bug, tracking bug, tag, or page tag. Common names for web beacons implemented through an embedded image include tracking pixel, pixel tag, 1×1 gif, and clear gif. [...] When implemented using JavaScript, they may be called JavaScript tags. There {{is a work in}} progress to standardize an interface that web developers can use to asynchronously transfer small HTTP data from the User Agent to a web server that call it simply beacons (in the context of web development) which can be used to send data to a web server prior to the loading of the document without delaying the load and affecting the perception of page load performance for the next navigation.|$|E
50|$|A tag {{management}} {{system is designed}} to help manage the lifecycle of e-marketing tags (sometimes referred to as tracking pixels or <b>web</b> <b>beacons),</b> which are used to integrate third-party software into digital properties.|$|R
2500|$|... "Spyware" [...] {{is mostly}} {{classified}} into four types: adware, system monitors, tracking cookies, and trojans; examples of other notorious types include {{digital rights management}} capabilities that [...] "phone home", keyloggers, rootkits, and <b>web</b> <b>beacons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Google Tag Manager is a tag {{management}} system created by Google to manage JavaScript and HTML tags used for tracking and analytics on websites (variants of e-marketing tags, {{sometimes referred to}} as tracking pixels or <b>web</b> <b>beacons).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The like button {{is one of}} Facebook's social plug-ins, {{in which}} the button can be placed on {{third-party}} websites. Its use centers around a form of an advertising network, in which it gathers information about which users visit what websites. This form of functionality, a sort of <b>web</b> <b>beacon,</b> has been significantly criticized for privacy. Privacy activist organizations have urged Facebook to stop its data collection through the plug-in, and governments have launched investigations into the activity for possible privacy law violations. Facebook has stated that it anonymizes the information after three months, and that the data collected is not shared or sold to third parties. Additionally, the like button's potential use as a measurement of popularity has caused some companies to sell likes through fake Facebook accounts, which in turn have sparked complaints from some companies advertising on Facebook that have received an abundance of fake likes that have distorted proper user metrics. Facebook states in its Terms of Service agreement that users may only create one personal page, and it has ongoing efforts against the spread of fake accounts. In the United States, pressing the [...] "like" [...] button on a page is protected as freedom of speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with any}} files {{transferred}} using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, <b>web</b> <b>beacons</b> are requested by sending the server their URL, {{and possibly the}} URL of the page containing them. Both contain {{information that can be}} useful for the gatherer: ...|$|R
50|$|This way, any {{subsequent}} page {{request from}} this user {{will carry the}} same query string , {{making it possible to}} establish that all these pages have been viewed by the same user. Query strings are often used in association with <b>web</b> <b>beacons.</b>|$|R

Components of information security that pertain to Internet and data security include confidentiality, integrity, availability, access control, authentication and non-repudiation. Factors {{that deal with}} electronic measures aimed at thwarting hackers include Secure Socket Layer, Cookies and <b>Web</b> <b>beacons.</b> The implications of information security for businesses and managers are also discussed...|$|R

5000|$|In 2002, the NAI {{released}} {{guidelines for}} use of <b>Web</b> <b>beacons</b> — small images or pieces of code used to track visiting and traffic patterns and install cookies on visitors' machines. [...] These guidelines use a similar model of notice and choice as the NAI Principles; opt-in consent is only required when sensitive information is associated with personally identifiable information and transferred to a third-party.|$|R

50|$|DataNeutrality {{works in}} concert with another New York-based organization, the for-profit {{start-up}} Mezzobit, to set data rules, perform compliance for Mezzobit, and send report cards to Mezzobit customers. A primary focus of the organizations is to govern the operation of third-party data collection tags, also called <b>web</b> <b>beacons,</b> and website visitor tracking. The intention {{is to create a}} self-regulatory framework for Internet data to augment industry standard and regulatory efforts.|$|R
50|$|Tracking via <b>web</b> <b>beacons</b> can be {{prevented}} by using email clients that do not download images whose URLs are embedded in HTML emails. Many graphical email clients can be configured to avoid accessing remote images. Examples include the Gmail, Yahoo!, and SpamCop/Horde webmail clients; Mozilla Thunderbird, Opera, Pegasus Mail, IncrediMail, Apple Mail, later versions of Microsoft Outlook, and KMail mail readers. Other HTML techniques (such as IFrames) can still be used to track email viewing.|$|R

50|$|In 2014, Lavoisier played Eric Preston in {{the soap}} opera <b>web</b> series <b>Beacon</b> Hill. In 2015, he began {{starring}} as Hugh Cambridge in {{the soap opera}} web series Winterthorne.|$|R
50|$|<b>Web</b> <b>beacons</b> {{are used}} by email marketers, spammers, and phishers to verify that email {{addresses}} are valid, that the content of emails has made it past the spam filters, and that the email is actually viewed by users. When the user reads the email, the email client requests the image, letting the sender know that the email address is valid and that the email was viewed. The email need not contain an advertisement or anything else related to the commercial activity of the sender. This makes detection of such emails harder for mail filters and users.|$|R
50|$|In June 2011, Sorel {{was let go}} from Days of Our Lives {{along with}} many other actors {{to make room for the}} return of supercouple John and Marlena and several other characters. In 2014, Sorel played Emily Tanner in the soap opera <b>web</b> series <b>Beacon</b> Hill.|$|R
