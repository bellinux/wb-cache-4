According to one account, he cured a woman of rheumatism by transferring the ailment to her father. Maple wrote that Pickingill was known to use cursing and malevolent magic on occasion, something that the folklorist contrasted with the activities of other contemporary cunning folk that he had studied, such as James Murrell. At harvest time, Maple recorded, Pickingill was known to wander around the field threatening to bewitch farm machinery, with many farmers thus offering him beer so that he would leave them alone. He was also recorded as coercing local people to obtain water for him from the village pump by threatening to set upon them <b>white</b> <b>mice,</b> a rodent which in local folklore was associated with misfortune. Another tale that Maple recorded also associated Pickingill with white mice; according to this, a visitor travelled to the cunning man's cottage only to find him lying in bed, with the mice suckling from his nipples.|$|E

25|$|A {{population}} of organisms evolves when an inherited trait becomes more common or less common over time. For instance, all the mice living {{on an island}} would be a single {{population of}} mice: some with white fur, some gray. If over generations, <b>white</b> <b>mice</b> became more frequent and gray mice less frequent, then {{the color of the}} fur in this population of mice would be evolving. In terms of genetics, this is called an increase in allele frequency.|$|E
25|$|Alleles {{become more}} or less common either by chance in a process called genetic drift, or by natural selection. In natural selection, if an allele makes it more likely for an {{organism}} to survive and reproduce, then over time this allele becomes more common. But if an allele is harmful, natural selection makes it less common. In the above example, if the island were getting colder each year and snow became present {{for much of the}} time, then the allele for white fur would favor survival, since predators {{would be less likely to}} see them against the snow, and more likely to see the gray mice. Over time <b>white</b> <b>mice</b> would become more and more frequent, while gray mice less and less.|$|E

Three of the gang were found guilty of the murder; before they were hanged, John Bishop and Thomas Williams confessed to drowning the boy in a well after drugging him with laudanum, stating, however, that the victim was actually from Lincolnshire.

The public outcry about the case put pressure on the government which led to the passing of the Anatomy Act of 1832; the act had been presented in 1829, following the Burke and Hare case, but was defeated. By permitting the bodies of paupers unclaimed by relatives to be supplied to medical schools for dissection, the act did away with the trade of the Resurrectionists.|$|E

500|$|In humans, a skin {{condition}} called piebaldism {{is caused by}} more than a dozen distinct mutations in the KIT gene. Piebaldism in humans is characterized by a white forelock, and pigmentless patches of skin on the forehead, brow, face, ventral trunk and extremities. Outside of pigmentation, piebaldism is an otherwise benign condition. In pigs, the [...] "patch," [...] "belted," [...] and commercial [...] "white" [...] colors are caused by mutations on the KIT gene. The best-known model for KIT gene function is the mouse, in which over 90 alleles have been described. The various alleles produce everything from white toes and blazes to black-eyed <b>white</b> <b>mice,</b> panda-white to sashed and belted. Many of these alleles are lethal in the homozygous state, lethal when combined, or sublethal due to anemia. Male mice with KIT mutations are often sterile.

[...] As {{a result of his}} research, he was able to design respirators for rescue workers. He tested the effect of carbon monoxide on his own body in a closed chamber, describing the results of his slow poisoning. In the late 1890s, he introduced the use of small animals for miners to detect dangerous levels of carbon monoxide underground, either <b>white</b> <b>mice</b> or canaries. With a faster metabolism, they showed the effects of poisoning before gas levels became critical for the workers, and so gave an early warning of the problem.

These spirits, which were also believed to work for witches as well, are referenced {{in many of the}} witch trial records from the Early Modern period. After examining these accounts, historian Emma Wilby noted how in the descriptions given of familiar spirits by both cunning folk and those accused of witchcraft, there was [...] "a pervading sense of naturalism", with most familiars resembling [...] "relatively ordinary humans or animals with only slight, if any, visual anomalies." [...] For instance, folklorist Eric Maple noted that in the English region of East Anglia during the latter nineteenth century, it was commonly thought that familiar spirits, which were often referred to as [...] "imps" [...] in that region, took the form of <b>white</b> <b>mice.</b> There were however some exceptions to these naturalistic familiars, for instance a woman in Cambridgeshire was believed to have a familiar spirit that was a cross between a frog and a rat.|$|E
