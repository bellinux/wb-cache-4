Signing a two-year deal with Lincoln, Nutter stated — [...] "I {{think it will}} benefit {{me to have a}} fresh start, play in front of new people and show what I can do. I feel I'm better than this level but I've got to show that and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that as a team". His Lincoln debut came on the opening day of the 2011–12 season, playing the whole match as Lincoln twice squandered a lead to draw 2–2 with Southport at Haig Avenue. He scored his first goal for the club in November 2011, netting Lincoln's third with a shot from outside the area in a 3–0 home win over Ebbsfleet United. Nutter would add to his goal tally once more during the campaign when he scored a 20-yard free-kick in an important 2–0 win against relegation rivals Newport County on 24 March 2012. Nutter played in all 51 of Lincoln's matches during the season, with the club struggling to adapt during their first season back in non-league, finishing just above the relegation places.|$|E

2500|$|The Basis steps {{demonstrate}} that the simplest provable sentences from [...] are also implied by , for any [...] (The proof is simple, since the semantic fact that a set implies any of its members, is also trivial.) The Inductive step will systematically cover all the further sentences that might be provable—by considering each case where we might reach a logical conclusion using an inference rule—and shows that if a new sentence is provable, it is also logically implied. (For example, {{we might have a}} rule telling us that from [...] "" [...] we can derive [...] " [...] or [...] ". In III.a We assume that if [...] is provable it is implied. We also know that if [...] is provable then [...] " [...] or [...] " [...] is provable. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that then [...] " [...] or [...] " [...] too is implied. We do so by appeal to the semantic definition and the assumption we just made. [...] is provable from , we assume.
