Fitted with a cowling to enclose the engine, they featured upgraded carburettors and cylinder blocks. Both new models suffered from poorly designed crankshaft bushings, resulting in <b>warranty</b> <b>claims</b> <b>against</b> the company. Until {{that time the}} [...] "Best Outboard Motor for the World" [...] (as the marketing slogan ran) had an envious reputation for reliability, but these new models were never popular and they dented the company's image.|$|R
50|$|Early {{versions}} of the Speed Six engine suffered from poor valve train durability leading to many <b>warranty</b> <b>claims</b> <b>against</b> TVR. Subsequent third party development work has mitigated this issue by using revised material harnesses for the cam lobes, finger followers and valve guides. Softer valve springs and valves with thicker stems were also utilised. Engines that have had these modifications performed have much improved durability. Another third party development offers a redesigned cylinder head with cam and bucket valve actuation so eliminating the use of finger followers altogether.|$|R

Additionally, since most NEMA 5-15P plugs have both current-carrying prongs the same width and rely on the ground pin for correct orientation, removing it allows insertion of the plug with hot and neutral wires reversed, creating an additional hazard.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} possible {{influence of the}} Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 on the common law obligations of the seller vis-à-vis: 1) risk and duty to take care, 2) eviction and 3) defects. Before one can {{have a look at}} the influence of new legislation on the common law, it is necessary to first go backward to look at where it all started in order to understand any possible influence. In the first chapter there is therefore a historical overview of the common law in general as well as the law of contract. Reference is also made to the Roman law perspective as well as the Roman concept of contract; the Roman-Dutch law perspective as well as the Roman-Dutch concept of contract; and the South African law perspective as well as the South African concept of contract. In chapter 2 the common law and the law of contract is discussed in general with reference to concepts such as ownership, law of obligation, and the emptio venditio. Chapter 3 deals with the essence of this dissertation as we look at the common law obligations of the seller and in specific the risk and duty of the seller to take care of the thing sold until it is handed over to the buyer (factors that influence the duty to take care, passing of risk, and passing of risk in sales by way of consignment); the seller‟s <b>warranty</b> <b>against</b> eviction (including the obligations of the buyer when there is a threat of possible eviction); and the seller‟s <b>warranty</b> <b>against</b> latent defects (ex lege warranties, ex contractu warranties, the actio empti and the aedilitian actions). In chapter 4 there is a very short discussion on the influence of the Constitution of South Africa, 1996 in general as well as specifically on the law of contract. Chapter 5 deals with the influence of the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 in general, specifically on the law of contract (why an Act to protect the interests of consumers?) and then the influence on risk and the seller‟s duty to take care of the thing sold (the consumer‟s right to return goods; the supplier‟s obligation to draw potential risk of an unusual character or that the consumer could not reasonably be expected to be aware of or that could result in serious injury or death to the attention of the consumer), the influence on the seller‟s <b>warranty</b> <b>against</b> eviction (the consumer‟s right to assume that the supplier is entitled to sell the goods; sections 44 and 51) and the influence on the seller‟s <b>warranty</b> <b>against</b> latent defects (disclosure of reconditioned or grey market goods; quality of goods).

5000|$|Rusty Jones Inc. {{filed for}} {{bankruptcy}} protection in 1988 claiming that automakers' extension of factory <b>warranties</b> <b>against</b> rust had caused business to deteriorate. Between 1985 and 1988, the company's distribution network declined from 3,000 new car dealerships to 1,800. However, there is some disagreement regarding why the company went out of business, as former director of marketing Bruce Freud claimed in an interview that the company was [...] "unbelievably profitable", but that its insurance carrier (who serviced the rust warranties on Rusty Jones treated vehicles) {{filed for bankruptcy}}, creating problems for the company.|$|R

5000|$|On appeal, {{the court}} held (per Lewis AJA), that the {{surrounding}} circumstances—what passed between the parties, their negotiations and their conduct—did not show that the words [...] "no warranty whatsoever" [...] had included the implied <b>warranty</b> <b>against</b> eviction. Although the phrase had to be regarded at first blush as a complete catch-all, saving the seller from any liability that might have arisen by operation of law, or by virtue of representations or warranties, it could not, given its generality, {{and the absence of}} any evidence that the question of title had been considered or in contemplation, have excluded the most fundamental obligation of the seller: to give undisturbed possession of the merx to the buyer. The only inference to be drawn from the circumstances was that Arnold had not intended or even contemplated that he might be deprived of possession by the true owner, and yet have no recourse to Van der Westhuizen. The evidence did not show that Van der Westhuizen had any such liability in mind either. In the circumstances, then, the provision in the document that Van der Westhuizen had given no warranties whatsoever did not exclude his liability for breach of the <b>warranty</b> <b>against</b> eviction. This did not mean that the words at issue were superfluous; they referred also to express warranties which would have related to the condition of the car.|$|R

50|$|Res aliena, {{things that}} are not the {{property}} of the seller, may also be the subject of a valid sale. It is not essential that the seller be the owner of the goods at the time of delivery. The sale is not void simply because the seller is not the owner of the res vendita, and has sold it without the owner's authority. What is essential is that the seller delivers the property to the buyer, and ensures that his possession is not thereafter interfered with by anyone with better title.

5000|$|Naturalia are terms {{automatically}} included, by {{operation of}} law (ex lege), in any contract belonging {{to one of the}} classes of specific contract traditionally recognised in South Africa. Naturalia are based on what is fair and reasonable between contracting parties over contracts of that kind. In a sale contract, for instance, the seller may not sell something that is defective. There are also guarantees against eviction in lease agreements. Generally speaking, the parties may exclude or vary naturalia by express agreement, in exclusion or exemption clauses (e.g. an ‘as is’ clause, known as a ‘voetstoots clause’, excluding the implied <b>warranty</b> <b>against</b> latent defects), though the courts interpret such agreements narrowly.|$|R
