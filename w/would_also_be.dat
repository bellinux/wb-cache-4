5|$|A {{black hole}} {{could be the}} power source instead of a star in order to {{increase}} the matter-to conversion efficiency. A black hole <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> smaller than a star.

Tukwila would have four processor cores and would replace the Itanium bus with a new Common System Interface, which <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used by a new Xeon processor.|$|E
5|$|In October 1966, NASA {{announced}} the flight would carry a small television camera to broadcast {{live from the}} Command Module. The camera <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> used to allow flight controllers to monitor the spacecraft's instrument panel in flight.

5|$|The act {{introduced}} a means-tested {{method of payment}} for students based {{on the amount of}} money their families earned.

The ships <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> equipped with two 500 kW emergency diesel generators.|$|E
5|$|A new 4-track {{trunk line}} along Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn from Borough Hall to Bedford Avenue. The line would narrow to three tracks to Broadway.

5|$|A release {{mechanism}} was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a {{pull on the}} attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag.

Failure to attach this rope was to play a pivotal role in the loss of the Patrie.|$|E

Historian David Hobbs wrote that they would mount Type 960 early warning, Type 982 intercept, Type 983 height-finding and Type 293M target indication radars. In addition a number of gunnery radars <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> needed.|$|E
5|$|Because Baltimore's {{electorate}} {{is overwhelmingly}} Democratic, whoever won the Democratic primary election {{was seen as}} the favorite over the Republican nominee in the general election. Baltimore's large African American population initially made it seem likely that the next mayor <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> African American. Kweisi Mfume was the preferred candidate of local politicians, but he opted not to run. Though Carl Stokes and Lawrence Bell, members of the City Council, declared for the race, local leaders were underwhelmed with the quality of declared candidates.|$|E

The contract required her to make four movies for Fox during the seven years. The studio would pay her $100,000 for each movie, and granted her the right to choose her own projects, directors and cinematographers. She <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> free to make one film with MMP per each completed film for Fox.|$|E
5|$|Callisto's leading {{hemisphere}} is less reflective {{than its}} trailing hemisphere, which could indicate {{that one of}} its sides has a higher surface temperature. On this darker, warmer side, sublimation rates of its icy surface <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> higher, causing more water vapor to be released into the atmosphere. This process would ultimately produce more hydrogen, which might explain the aforementioned variance in Callisto's atmospheric hydrogen levels.|$|E
50|$|Ares <b>would</b> <b>also</b> have <b>been</b> {{capable of}} placing a 4,000 kg payload into low Earth orbit as a {{single-stage}} to orbit launch vehicle.|$|R
