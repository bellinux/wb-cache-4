50|$|A Belt dryer / Belt cooler is {{a device}} {{designed}} for the particularly gentle thermal treatment of product. The <b>wet</b> <b>product</b> is continuously and evenly applied through an infeed chamber onto a perforated belt. The belt, predominantly in horizontal position, carries the product through the drying area which is divided into several sections. In these cells drying gas flows through or over the <b>wet</b> <b>product</b> and dries it. Each cell can be equipped with a ventilating fan and a heat exchanger. This modular design allows the drying and cooling temperatures to be controlled separately in the different sections. Thus, each dryer cell can be individually controlled and the drying / cooling air flow can be varied in each cell. In addition, {{the speed of the}} conveyor belt can be varied what gives an additional parameter for setting of drying time.The cells can be heated or cooled directly or indirectly, and all heating media, such as oil, steam, hot water or hot gas can be used.Belt dryers are ideally suited to drying almost any non-flowing product or more granular products that require a lower throughput capacity.|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} micro-retailing market {{its existence}} today {{threatened by the}} strong penetration of supermarkets, the condition does not occur only in big cities in developed country but also in development country such as rural coastal area. In order to measure the sustainability and durability on existence of the traditional wet market against rapid penetration of supermarket then study to investigate whether the customer who shop <b>wet</b> <b>product</b> on traditional market categories as loyal or inertia (spurious loyalty) is necessary. This research conducted in the Kei Islands which is rural coastal area in Indonesia with respondents were customers who shop <b>wet</b> <b>product</b> on the traditional micro-retail market {{for at least four}} times in a month. Using the structural equation modeling, the results of this research showed that customer who buy fisheries <b>wet</b> <b>product</b> on the traditional micro-retail market in Kei Islands were identified as spurious loyalty or inertia.

40|$|Efficient drying {{is still}} an {{important}} issue in industry. This work concerns the potential of adsorption drying using zeolite to enhance the energy efficiency of drying.

40|$|Aims This study {{compared}} {{the performance of}} the four main designs of absorbents for men with light incontinence: pouches (shields), leafs (guards), washable pant with integral pad (pantegral), and small disposable pad. Materials and Methods We did a multiple crossover trial. Men with light urinary incontinence were recruited. All pouches and leafs available in the UK were identified for inclusion. A single pantegral and small pad were selected based on previous evaluations for design comparison. Products were tested in random order for up to 1 week. Performance criteria (e. g., leakage and comfort) were rated using a validated product performance questionnaire. <b>Wet</b> <b>product</b> weights and amount of leakage were recorded in pad leakage diaries. Overall opinion for design performance was used as the primary outcome indicator. Results Seventy-four men tested six leafs, six pouches, one pantegral, and one small pad. Leakage data was taken from 3, 386 wet pads. The pouches generally performed poorly with few significant differences between products. The leafs were more variable with large and significant differences in ratings. Overall the leaf, pantegral, and small pad designs performed significantly better than the pouch (P ? 0. 01) and the pantegral design performed significantly worse than the leaf (P = 0. 01). One leaf product was outstanding and performed significantly better than all other designs (P ? 0. 001). Neurourol.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} all disposable pull-up-style pads (pull-ups) {{designed for}} children with learning and or physical disabilities and compare these with {{a representative sample of}} disposable diapers (diapers). DESIGN: A multicenter randomized crossover trial where all children evaluated each product. SETTING AND CHILDREN: A total of 61 community dwelling children with disabilities were recruited from 5 areas throughout the United Kingdom. Families were invited by letter to participate through their local clinical nurse specialist for continence care. INSTRUMENTS: Instruments used included a range of questionnaires (product performance, design performance, and design preference questionnaires) and pad weight and leakage diaries. METHODS: The children tested 10 products (5 pull-ups and 5 diapers) for up to 1 week per product both at home and at school. Caregivers (parents and guardians) completed the questionnaires after evaluation of individual products and design groups had been completed. They recorded <b>wet</b> <b>product</b> weights and scored pad leakage at each pad change. School staff completed an abbreviated product performance questionnaire for each product. RESULTS: There was little difference in the overall performance of the pull-ups compared with the diapers. In the pull-up group, one product performed significantly worse than the others for some performance aspects. Pull-ups worked particularly well for children able to assist with toileting and pad changes. Diapers were liked for ease of changing if the child used calipers, adapted footwear, or trousers. Diapers were more popular than pull-ups for night use, when greater absorbency was required. Neither design performed differently for school or home use. Most caregivers expressed a preference for diapers or pull-ups based on a range of individual needs, for example, level of independence in toileting, discreetness in pad change, fit, and product appearance. CONCLUSIONS: Diapers and pull-ups have different strengths and limitations, and both meet the specific needs of individual children. Although pull-ups are more expensive than diapers, their use is justified if based on a thorough assessment of individual need...|$|E

Povidone-iodine and chlorhexidine gluconate are currently {{the most commonly used}} antimicrobial agents used to prep the patient's skin. In this current study, the epidemiology, diagnosis, surveillance and prevention of SSI with chlorhexidine were investigated. The antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine was assessed. In in-vitro and in-vivo studies the antimicrobial efficacy of 2 % (w/v) chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) in 70 % isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and 10 % povidoneiodine (PVP-I) in the presence of 0. 9 % normal saline or blood were examined. The 2 % CHG in 70 % IPA solutions antimicrobial activity was not diminished in the presence of 0. 9 % normal saline or blood. In comparison, the traditional patient preoperative skin preparation, 10 % PVP-I antimicrobial activity was not diminished in the presence of 0. 9 % normal saline, but was diminished in the presence of blood. In an in-vivo human volunteer study the potential for reduction of the antimicrobial efficacy of aqueous patient preoperative skin preparations compromised by mechanical removal of <b>wet</b> <b>product</b> from the application site (blot) was assessed. In this evaluation, 2 % CHG and 10 % povidone-iodine (PVP-I) were blotted from the patient's skin after application to the test site. The blotting, or mechanical removal, of the wet antiseptic from the application site did not produce a significant difference in product efficacy. In a clinical trial to compare 2 % CHG in 70 % IPA and PVP-! scrub and paint patient preoperative skin preparation for the prevention of SSI, there were 849 patients randomly assigned to the study groups (409 in the chlorhexidine-alcohol and 440 in the povidone-iodine group) in the intention-to-treat analysis. The overall surgical site infection was significantly lower in the 2 % CHG in 70 % IPA group than in the PVP-I group (9. 5 % versus 16. 1 %, p= 0. 004; relative risk, 0. 59 with 95 % confidence interval of 0. 41 to 0. 85). Preoperative cleansing of the patient's skin with chlorhexidine-alcohol is superior to povidone-iodine in preventing surgical site infection after clean-contaminated surgery...|$|E

Essa situação (produto úmido) pode ocorrer quando a safra coincide com períodos chuvosos do ano, dificultando ou mesmo impedindo a secagem natural no campo. A infra-estrutura para secagem artificial dos grãos muitas vezes é inexistente ou aquém da necessária. O crescimento fúngico também pode ocorrer quando os grãos são reumidecidos durante o armazenamento ou o transporte em navios para exportação. O milho é o principal cereal cultivado em nosso país, tendo alcançado uma produção média de 35 milhões de toneladas nas safras de 2001 / 2002 (CaNAS, 2002) e aquele que no mundo, tem apresentado maiores problemas com micotoxinas. Dentre essas, merecem destaque as aflatoxinas, devido à sua elevada toxicidade e potencial carcinogênico e porque as principais espécies produtoras dessas micotoxinas (Aspergillus fIavus e Aspergillus parasiticus) estão adaptadas e ocorrem com freqüência em nossas condições climáticas. A fosfina, fumigante largamente utilizado no controle de insetos de grãos armazenados, tem se apresentado como uma alternativa promissora para o controle de fungos e micotoxinas em grãos com elevado teor de umidade. Apresenta ainda como vantagens a sua facilidade de aplicação, disponibilidade comercial e o fato de praticamente não deixar resíduos no produto. [...] . Observação: O resumo, na íntegra, poderá ser visualizado no texto completo da tese digitalThe tropical {{weather conditions}} that prevail during most {{part of the}} year inour country favour fungal growth and the production of mycotoxins, mainly whenthe freshly harvested com is kept at high moisture content while waiting for drying. This situation (<b>wet</b> <b>product),</b> can occur when the harvest season coincides with therainy season of the year, making it difficult to achieve natural drying in the field. The infra-structure for the artificial drying of the grains either does not exist or thecapacity is insufficient to meet the demandoFungal growth can also occur when thegrains are re-wetted during storage or transported by ship for exporting. Com is the main cereal grown in our country. The production in the 2001 / 2002 harvest was 35 millions tons and this crop has shown the biggestproblems with mycotoxins globally. Among mycotoxins, the aflatoxins requireattention, due to their high toxigenicity and carcinogenic potential and also becausethe main aflatoxin-producing species (Aspergilllus fIavus and Aspergillus parasiticus) are adapted to and occur frequent/y in our climatic conditions. Phosphine, a fumigant widely applied for insect control in stored grain,. {{has been shown to be}} an altemative for controlling fungi and mycotoxin production in grains with high moisture content. It also has the advantage of easy application, commercial availability and that it leaves no significant chemical residue in the grain. The main objective of the present study was to verify the effects of phosphine on the growth of Aspergillus flavus and on aflatoxin production in com stored at high moisture content. For this study, samples were previously inoculated with an Aspergillus flavus toxigenic strain. The concomitant effect of water activities from 0. 85 to 0. 98 (equivalent to moisture content of 15. 3 % and 24. 5 %, w. b.), concentrations from O to 4 g m- 3 and exposure times from 1 to 15 days to the fumigant was verified by the Surface Response Methodology. Moisture content, water activity, mycological, ergosterol, aflatoxins and phosphine residue analyses were carried out in the samples submitted to the different treatments. [...] .

30|$|Thin {{stillage}} (TS) is a dilute {{stream of}} organic and inorganic compounds produced as a coproduct of the ethanol industry. Usually, TS is processed by drying than added to {{distillers dried grains}} (DDG) to produce DDG with solubles (DDGS). The latter is used in animal feeds. In the manufacture of DDGS, TS is first concentrated into syrup before mixing with wet distillers grains. TS drying consumes about 40 - 45 % of the thermal energy and 30 - 40 % of the electrical energy utilized in a dry-grind facility (Wilkins et al. 2006). The energy required to evaporate {{the large amount of}} water entrained in TS is a major cost in the ethanol industry and contributes to the poor lifecycle assessment of ethanol production (Bremer et al. 2010). To overcome the losses in energy for this process several strategies have been proposed including feeding wet distiller's grains with solubles. This has the advantage of decreasing the cost of drying but necessitates transporting water with the feed product to the animals. In addition the <b>wet</b> <b>products</b> may not be suited for storage.|$|R

This paper examines the feeding value of sun-dried brewers’ grain and maize silage (whole plant) for fattening rabbits. Twenty-four individually caged 8 -wk-old rabbits {{were used to determine}} the digestibility. Both <b>wet</b> <b>products</b> were sun-dried and ground before being incorporated into a basal diet. The inclusion level at the expense of all basal ingredients amounted to 30 %. Basal diet and both experimental diets were fed ad libitum to 8 rabbits during the 4 -d balance trial. The determined digestibility of protein, fat, crude fibre and neutral detergent fibre digestibility amounted to 76. 2 and 77. 2 %; 86. 5 and 99. 1 %; 8. 1 and 8. 3 % and 28. 0 and 13. 5 %, respectively, for brewers’ grain and maize silage. The digestible energy content amounted to 11. 66 MJ/kg dry matter (DM) (brewers’ grain) and 11. 10 MJ/kg DM (maize silage). Both by-products have potential as alternative feedstuff in rabbit diets. However, further experiments are necessary to determine the effect of ensilaging the whole maize plant, as a significantly lower (P< 0. 001) feed intake was observed...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) It {{is common}} {{practice}} in industry to beneficiate coal (and other minerals) to meet contractual obligations. This beneficiation increases the concentration of the valuable component in the product by removing the unwanted gangue or mineral matter in predominantly density based separations. Current beneficiation technology relies heavily on water-based separation devices that are highly efficient. However these require extensive water recovery operations and result in a <b>wet</b> <b>product</b> that has a reduced value and higher transport cost than an equivalent dry product. As water supplies in the mining areas of Australia become less reliable, there is renewed interest in beneficiation technologies {{that do not require}} water or water recovery operations and can produce a product of equivalent value to water-based beneficiation. This thesis considers dry beneficiation in a novel gas-solid fluidised bed, known as the Reflux Classifier, {{with the addition of a}} dense-medium and vibration. Prior to this work, the application of the water-based Reflux Classifier to the separation of particles on the basis of size and/or density had been extensively studied and the use of the pneumatic Reflux Classifier as a size separation device had also been investigated. The application of the pneumatic Reflux Classifier to the density based beneficiation of particles had not been previously considered. In the present study, the density based separation of particles in a laboratory scale pneumatic Reflux Classifier was considered. The apparatus was constructed of stainless steel and had a cross-sectional area of 20 mm × 100 mm with a plenum chamber and distributor below a 1 m vertical fluidised bed and a 2 m channel inclined at 70 º to the horizontal above. A sand dense-medium was used to encourage density based separations and sand was continually fed to the bed in all experiments. The bed could be configured for batch separations with continuous overflow removal, or continuous separations with both continuous overflow and underflow removal. The whole apparatus could be vibrated to study the effect of the addition of vibration to the separations. The separations obtained in the Reflux Classifier were compared to separations in a 3 m vertical fluidised bed to determine the effect of the incline on the separation performance of the vessel. The majority of the separation experiments were conducted on batch quantities of plastic tracer particles in the size range - 6. 35 + 1. 0 mm with densities of 1300, 1600, 1800, 2100 and 2400 kg/m³. In batch experiments, tracer particles of a single density were placed on the distributor and the bed filled with silica sand (density 2600 kg/m³, - 355 + 90 μm). The gas and vibration were introduced simultaneously with a continuous feed of sand medium and the rate of elutriation of particles (both sand and tracer) from the bed was measured. The batch experiments investigated the effect of changing the vibration frequency and direction, including separations with no vibration, across the range of tracer particle densities. In continuous experiments, steady state between the feed and the continuous overflow and underflow of sand was established. The tracer particles in single density samples were fed into the bed in 10 minute intervals over a period of 40 minutes and their rate of exit through the overflow and underflow was measured. The continuous experiments investigated the effect of changing the overflow rate of particles at a constant feed rate and the effect of changing the gas rate. The sand fluidised bed acted as a dense-medium, or pseudo-fluid, enhancing the density separation of particles. Increasing the gas rate, or decreasing the vibration frequency both acted to increase the size of bubbles in the bed, which resulted in less homogeneity in the medium and thus less effective separations. As with all dense media operations, the effectiveness of the medium increased for larger tracer particles. An almost perfect density separation of particles greater than 4 mm in diameter was observed while for particles less than 2 mm in diameter the separation was more dependent on the convective velocity of the medium than the particle size. The rate of particle elutriation from the bed was first order dependent on particle concentration. The elutriation rate data for the batch experiments was modelled using a two-parameter model for dispersed plug flow to find the particle velocity and dispersion. The particle velocity was found to consist of a convective velocity due to the flowrate of the sand through the vessel that affected all particles equally, and a buoyant velocity dependent on particle size and density. This buoyant velocity could be predicted from an equation for particle terminal velocity in the Intermediate regime, with the density and viscosity of the medium dependent on the vibration conditions The density cut-point of the separations could be varied by changing the overflow rate, the vibration rate and the gas rate. Increasing the overflow rate or the gas rate led to a higher density cut-point while increasing the vibration frequency reduced the density cut-point. The separation efficiency decreased with decreasing particle size or increasing gas rate, but was largely unaffected by the overflow rate. The inclusion of the incline increased the separation efficiency by encouraging the refluxing of near density particles, as observed in the water-based Reflux Classifier. This refluxing is a unique characteristic of the inclined channel that was not observed in the vertical fluidised bed. The separation performance of the experimental apparatus was very good for the largest particles in comparison to water-based beneficiation devices but poor for particles below 2. 0 mm. For particles in the size range - 6. 35 + 4. 0 mm the separation efficiency, measured by the Ep, was 0. 04 for the batch separations and 0. 06 for the continuous separations. This compares well with the 0. 02 - 0. 03 Ep of water-based dense-medium cyclones on the same size coal particles. The Ep for particles in the size range - 2. 0 + 1. 0 mm was 0. 16 in the batch separations and 0. 35 in the continuous separations which is significantly higher than the 0. 07 Ep of the water-based Reflux Classifier and the 0. 14 to 0. 18 Ep of water-based spirals. From the tracer particle experiments the best conditions for a continuous coal separation were determined to be high frequency vibration, and minimal gas and overflow rates, with the Reflux Classifier performing better than a vertical fluidised bed. A separation of coal confirmed that the dense-medium pneumatic Reflux Classifier with vibration can perform good density based separations. The geometry used in this work restricted the processing capacity (tonnage) of the unit to approximately 1. 5 t/m². h, with higher feed rates resulting in particles accumulating in the bed and causing blockages. A waterbased Reflux Classifier has a throughput capacity as high as 47 t/m². h. This thesis describes the first attempt to characterise the behaviour of a Reflux Classifier with sand dense-medium. The intention was to determine if such an apparatus could be used to separate particles on the basis of density and the potential for its application as an industrial process. The focus was on the changes in behaviour and the separation cut-point and efficiency with changing conditions. From this work it was concluded that the laboratory scale Reflux Classifier can separate particles on the basis of density with similar efficiency and cut-point to current industrial standards but the processing capacity is significantly below that of similar footprint water-based technologies...|$|E

The hypothesis examined {{in the present study was}} that adding fluids to foods will influence chewing physiology. Twenty subjects chewed on melba toast, cake, carrot, peanut and Gouda cheese. They also chewed on these foods after addition of different volumes of water or alpha-amylase solution. Jaw muscle activity, number of chewing cycles until swallowing and chewing cycle duration were measured. Repeated measures analysis of variance was applied to test the null hypothesis that there would be no statistically significant difference among the results obtained for the various food types and fluids. Subsequently, contrasts were determined to study the levels of intra-subjects factors (food type and fluid volume). Linear regression was used to determine the changes in muscle activity and cycle duration as a function of the chewing cycles. Fluid addition significantly decreased muscle activity and swallowing threshold for melba, cake and peanut (p 0. 05). Doubling the volume of tap water had a greater effect.

We examined the hypothesis that adding fluid to a food will influence the chewing process. Twenty healthy subjects chewed on melba toast, breakfast cake, carrot, peanut and Gouda cheese. In addition they chewed on these foods after we added different volumes of tap water or a solution of ¿-amylase. We measured jaw muscle activity and the number of cycles until swallowing. Furthermore, we obtained visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for texture and sound attributes for all foods and fluid conditions. The additional fluids significantly lowered muscle activity and swallowing threshold for melba, cake and peanut. The effect of ¿-amylase in the solutions was rather limited. Doubling the volume of tap water had a larger effect. Several texture and sound attributes of melba, cake and peanut were also significantly affected by the additional fluids. For melba, cake, and peanut we observed significant correlations between the physiology parameters and several attributes for the various fluid conditions. This indicates that the added fluid affects both the physiology (muscle activity and number of cycles) and the sensory perception of a number of texture and sound attributes.
