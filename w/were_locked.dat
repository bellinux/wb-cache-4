5|$|At least 200 people fell or {{jumped to}} their deaths from the burning towers (as {{exemplified}} in the photograph The Falling Man), landing {{on the streets and}} rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of feet below. Some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the roof in hope of helicopter rescue, but the roof access doors <b>were</b> <b>locked.</b> No plan existed for helicopter rescues, and the combination of roof equipment and thick smoke and intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching.|$|E
5|$|Del Piero's first {{appearance}} after the 2006 FIFA World Cup triumph {{was in a}} Coppa Italia match against Cesena on 23 August 2006. As Juventus played in the Serie B for the 2006–07 season, the Coppa Italia campaign became increasingly important for the club {{in order to achieve}} a UEFA Cup spot. Having been on vacation beforehand, Del Piero started on the bench. Juventus and Cesena <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> on 1–1 when Del Piero entered in the 74th minute and after nine seconds, he scored the winning goal for Juventus.|$|E
5|$|In 1912 the Davis Library {{was added}} to the campus with space for 5,000 volumes. Although a major improvement, its {{atmosphere}} was inhospitable by the standards of later generations. Stacks <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> to students, for example, and the librarian's office was located {{at the entrance to the}} stacks to maximize control over entry. Decisions about book selections and the library's program were in the hands of an all-male faculty committee instead of the female librarian.|$|E

5000|$|One enemy can <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> onto {{multiple}} times, but {{the number}} of times they can <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> on to depends on the amount of health remaining. For example, enemies with only 1 hit point can only <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> onto once.|$|R
50|$|Result: A > D, B > C and C > D <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> in first. Now, D > B can't <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> in {{since it}} would create a cycle B > C > D > B. Finally, B > A and C > A <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> in. Hence, the full ranking is B > C > A > D. Thus, B is elected Ranked pairs winner.|$|R
5|$|On August 19, 1953, a burned crewman {{talks to}} three {{government}} agents about his {{experience on the}} submarine Zeus Faber, completing the story told in the previous episode. He explains that he and other crew members <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> in with their captain, who was infected by the black oil. After being knocked out from behind, the black oil leaves the captain's body and exits via a grate into the sea. It is revealed that Bill Mulder and the Smoking Man {{are two of the}} agents who are interviewing the crewman.|$|E
5|$|The {{currency}} {{was introduced}} in non-physical form (traveller's cheques, electronic transfers, banking, etc.) at midnight on 1 January 1999, when the national currencies of participating countries (the eurozone) ceased to exist independently. Their exchange rates <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> at fixed rates against each other. The euro thus became the successor to the European Currency Unit (ECU). The notes and coins for the old currencies, however, continued {{to be used as}} legal tender until new euro notes and coins were introduced on 1 January 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} fire {{claimed the}} lives of at least ten people, who were unable to escape because the doors <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> shut illegally. Authorities, in response to local residents' angry criticism, admitted that the emergency response to the accident was substandard. Two separate investigations were launched. One inquiry focused on the fire itself, while the other sought to ascertain criminal responsibility for the disaster as well as the operation of the illegal factory. The results of both are either pending or have yet to be released to the general public.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lock</b> files <b>are</b> often named with a tilde (...) prefixed to {{the name}} of the file they <b>are</b> <b>locking.</b> If they <b>are</b> <b>locking</b> a {{resource}} other than a file, they may be named more arbitrarily.|$|R

50|$|XKB {{allows a}} {{modifier}} to <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> or latched, other than being in its regular state. Normally, a modifier is active exactly {{when it is}} pressed, like the Shift. However, a modifier may also <b>be</b> <b>locked,</b> like the Caps Lock modifier. When a modifier <b>is</b> <b>locked,</b> it remains active until it is explicitly deactivated. An intermediate condition between regular and <b>locked</b> <b>is</b> the latched state: When a modifier is latched, it remains active, but only until the next non-modifier key is pressed.|$|R
5|$|Acting on Almond's instruction, Smith {{ordered the}} 5th Marines to attack west toward Mupyong-ni on 27 November. The attack was soon stalled by the PVA 89th Division {{and forced the}} Marines to dig in on the ridges {{surrounding}} Yudam-ni. As night came, three Chinese regiments of the 79th Division attacked the ridges on the north and northwest of Yudam-ni, hoping to annihilate the garrison in one stroke. Close range fighting soon developed as the attackers infiltrated Marine positions, but the 5th and 7th Marines held the line while inflicting heavy casualties to the Chinese. As day broke on 28 November, the Chinese forces and the American defenders <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> in a stalemate around the Yudam-ni perimeter.|$|E
5|$|At {{one meeting}} in October 1853, he shared the {{platform}} with John B. Horsfall and Chartist leader Ernest Jones, whose Labour Parliament Grimshaw {{was involved in}} the following year as one of the two delegates from Preston, along with Wallace Beever. The Labour Parliament was partly a response to a lock-out of around 20,000 mill workers by the employers in Preston; its aim was to organise a levy on wages to support operatives who went on strike or <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> out. Those paying the levy were to elect a committee to buy and look after land and factories and the Parliament would meet on a yearly basis. However, the plan did not gain support among all Chartists and the plans never materialised.|$|E
5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a vertical position, and moved it to within five inches of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|Fighting {{had also}} been ongoing between the tops (platforms at the {{junction}} of mast and topmast) of the ships, as rival sharpshooters fired upon their opponents and upon sailors on the exposed decks below. While the ships <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> together, the British marksmen, led by midshipman William Smith, commander of the fore-top, stormed Chesapeakes fore-top over the yard-arm and killed all the Americans there. Following this, the wind tore the two ships apart, and Chesapeake was blown around the bows of Shannon. This left the British boarders, about fifty-strong, stranded. However, organised resistance aboard the American ship had almost ceased by this time.|$|E
5|$|For the 1920 season, Maryland {{played in}} the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SAIAA). Meanwhile, members of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> in a heated debate over whether first-year {{students}} should be eligible to play football. The larger schools, in general, were against the practice, and eventually the disagreement resulted in a schism within the SIAA. Eight teams from the SIAA split to form the Southern Conference: Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, Georgia, Georgia Tech, Kentucky, Mississippi State, and Tennessee. They were joined by six non-SIAA members: North Carolina, North Carolina State, Virginia, Virginia Tech, Washington & Lee, and Maryland. Maryland would remain within the Southern Conference {{for the next three}} decades.|$|E
5|$|Governor Mark Sanford {{declared}} a state of emergency as Charley approached landfall and issued a mandatory evacuation for residents on barrier islands and in coastal locations in Georgetown and Horry Counties. In Georgetown County, this order was focused on residents and tourists east of U.S. Route 17, likewise for Horry County. 180,000people evacuated the Grand Strand. Drawbridges in Beaufort and Charleston Counties were shut down, and bridges in Georgetown and Horry Counties <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> down. Hampton County requested 2,000sandbags, that were provided by the Department of Corrections. The Wateree Correctional Institution also filled 30,000sandbags for potential floods. State troopers directed traffic inland from Myrtle Beach. U.S. Route 501 used a lane reversal to allow for evacuations.|$|E

5|$|Griffin {{designed}} the lake with many geometric motifs, {{so that the}} axes of his design lined up with natural geographical landmarks in the area. However, government authorities changed his original plans and no substantial work was completed before he left Australia in 1920. His scheme remained unfulfilled as the Great Depression and World War II intervened, {{and it was not}} until the 1950s that planning resumed. After much political dispute over several proposed variations, excavation work began in 1960 with the energetic backing of Prime Minister Robert Menzies. After the completion of the bridges and dams, the dams <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> in September 1963. However, a drought meant that the target water level was not reached until April 1964. It was formally inaugurated on 17 October 1964.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, the United States, the United Kingdom and the German Empire <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> in {{a dispute}} over control of the Samoan Islands. Historian George H. Ryden's {{research}} indicates Harrison {{played a key role in}} determining the status of this Pacific outpost by taking a firm stand on every aspect of Samoa conference negotiations; this included selection of the local ruler, refusal to allow an indemnity for Germany, as well as the establishment of a three power protectorate, a first for the U.S.. These arrangements facilitated the future dominant power of the U.S. in the Pacific; Secretary of State Blaine was absent due to complication of lumbago.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, Berkman, Goldman, and Aronstam {{relocated}} to Worcester, Massachusetts, where they operated a successful luncheonette. At {{the end of}} June, Goldman saw a newspaper headline that brought to her attention the trio's first opportunity for political action: the Homestead Strike. In June 1892, workers at a steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> out when negotiations between the Carnegie Steel Company and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers failed. Henry Clay Frick, the factory's notoriously anti-union manager, hired 300 armed guards from the Pinkerton Detective Agency to break the union's picket lines. When the Pinkerton guards arrived at the factory {{on the morning of}} July6, a gunfight broke out. Nine union workers and seven guards were killed in the 12-hour fight.|$|E

5|$|In 1912, {{there was}} an army camp held in the grounds of Somerhill. The {{soldiers}} were housed in bell tents. On Sir Osmond's death in 1940, it then passed to his eldest son Sir Henry. During the Second World War, Somerhill {{was the site of}} a Prisoner of War camp, known as POW Camp No. 40. Italian POWs were amongst those housed at Somerhill. The Army were in possession of Somerhill from 1940–49. Squatters occupied some of the 40-plus huts in 1948, they <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> in by the Colonel in charge of the camp at the time.|$|E
5|$|Not {{much had}} {{changed by the}} 1960s. The day began with a waking bell at 6:45am. After a {{prisoner}} count, they moved into the yard until 7:30, when they collected breakfast {{and headed back to}} their cells. The 8:00 bell signaled a parade, and then the start of work, which lasted until 11:15. They ate a meal, locked in their cells until 12:20pm, followed by some time in the yards. At 1:00 there was another parade, and another session of work which lasted to 4:15. Another meal was collected, and prisoners <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> away in their cells overnight. The lights stayed on until 9:30pm. On the weekends the routine featured no work, and included a film played for the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|On August 5, the KPA's 12th Division {{pushed back}} the ROK Capital Division in the Ch'ongsong-Kigye area, and linked up with {{elements}} of the 766th which had infiltrated the area of Pohyunsan. Unopposed, they began to prepare to attack P'ohang to secure entry into the UN's newly established Pusan Perimeter. The Regiment was ordered to begin an attack in coordination with the KPA's 5th Division. The Korean People's Army planned simultaneous offensives across the entire Perimeter, including a flanking maneuver by the 766th and the 5th Division to envelop UN troops and push them back to Pusan. The 766th was not reinforced; North Korean planners intended it to move unseen around the UN lines {{while the majority of}} the UN and North Korean troops <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> in fighting around Taegu and the Naktong Bulge.|$|E

30|$|The IR laser can <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> to the high-finesse IR cavity {{by using}} {{standard}} Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) locking techniques [83, 84]. Since the other optical modes for intra-cavity cooling in the high-finesse IR cavity are derived via EOMs and AOMs from the fundamental laser mode (see Section  7.2. 3), they also follow any {{changes of the}} cavity resonance frequency. In addition, these higher-order modes can in turn <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> to the cavity via PDH locking. We will also use an EOM to generate a mode to <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> to the IR + UV cavity. To this end, each of the modes to <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> to the cavities will separately be frequency modulated in the MHz range {{to allow for the}} generation of distinct PDH error signals from the light reflected from the cavity.|$|R
