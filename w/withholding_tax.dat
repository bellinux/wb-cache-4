25|$|With {{respect to}} {{creditors}} resident in Switzerland, the <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> {{is only a}} means of securing the payment of the income or profit tax, from which the creditor may then deduct the amount already withheld, or request its refund. The same applies to foreign creditors {{to the extent that}} a tax treaty provides for it. Other foreign creditors are not eligible for a refund; with respect to them, the <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> is a genuine tax.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Various {{countries}} have extended the levying of <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> {{beyond the traditional}} <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> on royalties, dividends and interest. <b>Withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> are now often levied on services such as management services, professional services, technical services, financial services, insurance services, fees, commission, advisory services and digital services, amongst others. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to consider the impact of these <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> on certain services, in particularly intra-group cross border services in the context of source and related transfer pricing principles...|$|R
50|$|<b>Withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> on {{dividends}} {{grant the}} source country its share in tax revenue. From {{the perspective of}} a company, <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> are disadvantageous. Profits are taxed again when they are distributed (in contrast to dividends that are not distributed across borders) even though they have already been subject to corporate taxation. Enterprises in countries with no/low <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> are more attractive because they can distribute dividends with a lower tax burden.|$|R
2500|$|Tax payment: Taxpayers {{must pay}} income tax due {{without waiting for}} an assessment. [...] Many taxpayers are subject to <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> when they receive income. To the extent <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> do not cover all taxes due, all taxpayers must make {{estimated}} tax payments.|$|R
25|$|Dividend <b>Withholding</b> <b>Tax</b> is deducted at {{the rate}} of 20% from {{dividends}} paid by Irish companies. It can be set off against income tax due, or reclaimed where the recipient of the dividend is not liable to tax.|$|E
25|$|A {{proportional}} tax is levied by the cantons (at varying rates) on the Eigenkapital (ownership equity) of companies. Thinly capitalised companies are taxed, moreover, on the liabilities that function as equity. This {{also means that}} debts paid on such liabilities cannot be deducted for purposes of the profit tax, and {{are subject to the}} federal <b>withholding</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|E
25|$|Either a {{progressive}} or proportional income tax is levied by the Confederation {{and by the}} cantons on the income of natural persons. The income tax is imposed as a payroll tax on foreign workers without a residence permit, and {{in the form of}} a <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> on certain transient persons, such as foreign musicians performing in Switzerland.|$|E
50|$|Many jurisdictions require persons paying {{amounts to}} nonresidents to collect tax due from a nonresident {{with respect to}} certain income by <b>withholding</b> such <b>tax</b> from such {{payments}} and remitting the tax to the government. Such levies are generally referred to as <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes.</b> These requirements are induced because of potential difficulties in collection of the <b>tax</b> from nonresidents. <b>Withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> are often imposed at rates differing from the prevailing income tax rates. Further, the rate of withholding may vary by type of income or type of recipient. Generally, <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> are reduced or eliminated under income tax treaties (see below). Generally, <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> are imposed on the gross amount of income, unreduced by expenses. Such taxation provides for great simplicity of administration but can also reduce the taxpayer's awareness {{of the amount of}} tax being collected.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the incidence of}} nonresident interest <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> in the international 3 -month Treasury-bill market and the international 5 -year government bond market. The approach is one of pooled cross-section, time-series regressions. We find that, in general, U. S. dollar yields on national Treasury-bills and pre-tax 5 -year government bond yields fully reflect nonresident interest <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> imposed on American or Japanese investors. Nonresident interest <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> on short-term and long-term government debt thus {{do not appear to}} be borne by the international investor. ...|$|R

25|$|The federal <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> (Verrechnungssteuer / impôt anticipé / Imposta preventiva) is levied {{at a rate}} of 35 {{percent on}} certain forms of income, most notably {{dividend}} payments, interest on bank loans and bonds, liquidation proceeds, lottery prizes and payments by life insurances and private pension funds. The debtor of such payments is liable for the payment of the tax; they must pay the creditor only the net amount.|$|E
25|$|Taxpayers {{generally}} must self assess {{income tax}} by filing tax returns. Advance payments of tax are {{required in the}} form of <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> or estimated tax payments. Taxes are determined separately by each jurisdiction imposing tax. Due dates and other administrative procedures vary by jurisdiction. April 15 following the tax year is the last day for individuals to file tax returns for federal and many state and local returns. Tax as determined by the taxpayer may be adjusted by the taxing jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|Professional Services <b>Withholding</b> <b>Tax</b> (PSWT) is deducted at {{the rate}} of 20% from {{payments}} made by government bodies, health boards, state bodies, local authorities, and the like, from payments made for professional services. Professional services include medical, dental, pharmaceutical, optical, aural, veterinary, architectural, engineering, quantity surveying, accounting, auditing, finance, marketing, advertising, legal, and geological services, as well as training services supplied to FÁS It can be deducted from the tax ultimately payable by the service provider, or where the provider is non-resident or exempt from tax, reclaimed.|$|E
50|$|In the European Union (EU) <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> {{are reduced}} by the Parent-Subsidiary Directive {{as well as the}} Interest and Royalties Directive for {{transactions}} within the EU.

25|$|The ANSES {{is funded}} by an 11% <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> rate and payroll taxes (56%), {{as well as by}} a share of value added and other tax {{receipts}} (22%), contributions from the national budget (17%), and interest receipts (4%). Expenses include social security payments (63%), transfers to provincial and other pension funds (20%), family assistance (12%), and the netbook program (2%); administrative expenses were around 2%. The agency maintains a stabilization fund, the Sustainability Guarantee Fund (FGS), which held approximately us$46 billion in a variety of financial instruments as of December 2011, of which 58% was held in government securities, 14% in productive investment, 12% in time deposits, and 9% in the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange.|$|E
25|$|Several charges {{described}} as taxes are not, in the literal sense, actual taxes, but withholdings from certain payments made. In each case, the payer withholds the relevant percentage and pays it to Revenue. The recipient is still liable for {{tax on the}} full amount, but can set the withholding against his overall tax liability. If the amount withheld {{is less than the}} tax payable, the recipient is still liable for the difference, and if the amount withheld exceeds the tax payable, the recipient can set it off against other tax due, or obtain a refund. This contrasts with DIRT, which, while a <b>withholding</b> <b>tax,</b> discharges the entire tax liability of the recipient.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) (codified in the Internal Revenue Code) {{imposes a}} Social Security <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> equal to 6.20% {{of the gross}} wage amount, up to but not {{exceeding}} the Social Security Wage Base ($97,500 for 2007; $102,000 for 2008; and $106,800 for 2009, 2010, and 2011). The same 6.20% tax is imposed on employers. For 2011 and 2012, the employee's contribution was reduced to 4.2%, while the employer's portion remained at 6.2%. In 2012, the wage base increased to $110,100. In 2013, the wage base increased to $113,700. For each calendar year for which the worker is assessed the FICA contribution, the SSA credits those wages as that year's covered wages. The income cutoff is adjusted yearly for inflation and other factors.|$|E
40|$|Cross-border M&As {{can trigger}} a higher {{international}} taxation of the target’s income. Non-resident dividend <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> may be {{imposed by the}} target country, while additional corporate income taxation can be imposed by the acquiring country. This paper examines how these additional tax liabilities affect takeover premiums and thus the gains to target shareholders. Our evidence suggests that takeover premiums fully reflect non-resident dividend <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes,</b> while they reflect corporate income taxation by the acquiring country less than fully. The incidence of non-resident withholding taxation thus appears to be entirely on target shareholders. Hence, <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> {{do not seem to}} serve the purpose of taxing foreign acquirers. This evidence is consistent with previous findings that the gains of M&As primarily accrue to target shareholders. International Taxation; takeover premiums...|$|R

40|$|The EU Commission {{identifies}} {{two major}} {{shortcomings of the}} cross‐border taxation of dividends received by portfolio shareholders in its consultation paper. Firstly, <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> may be levied and credited in a discriminatory manner which may constitute an infringement of the free movement of capital set out in Articles 63 to 66 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Secondly, the imposition of <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> may result in double taxation {{and as a consequence}} impede investors from investing in foreign corporations. Hence, the benefits of international risk diversification are not fully exploited which may result in welfare losses. 1 The parent‐subsidiary‐directive 2 addresses this issue by prohibiting the imposition of dividends paid to substantial shareholdings. A comparable relief is, however, not available for portfolio and individual investors. In turn, <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> on interest have been considerably reduced and even abolished by many member states whereas <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> on dividends are still common and significant. 3 This report therefore discusses how the above highlighted issues concerning the cross‐border taxation of dividends received by individuals can be resolved. The taxation of portfolio investments by corporations which is also left out of the scope of the parent‐subsidiary‐directive is not addressed in the following as this issue requires a separate analysis...|$|R
25|$|In the end, {{options for}} the {{financing}} of the purchase came down to two companies, Westpac and Allco Leasing. One {{of the more interesting}} notes to the Allco proposal was the nature of the financing arrangements it was proposing. At the time of the proposed financing deal, interest rates in Australia were around 16-17%, placing a significant burden on companies in their business dealings. To work around this, Allco proposed a financing structure that involved a cross-border financing arrangement in Japan. It also required the establishment of a special purposes lessor company, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, to minimise <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> liabilities from the Japanese and Australian taxation agencies. Allco refused to release specific information on the proposed structure, due to its policy prohibiting the release of specific details of this financing arrangement until it had secured a mandate for their services.|$|E
25|$|However, Switzerland did {{not want}} to be seen as an {{obstacle}} to closer tax cooperation among EU-member states and decided to support the international efforts to adequately tax cross-border investment income. The retention tax agreed with the European Union (EU) in the taxation of savings income agreement is a suitable and efficient means of doing so. The EU is committed to eliminating existing loopholes in the system of taxation of savings income. Switzerland has expressed to the EU its willingness in principle to correspondingly adjust the taxation of savings income. Here it should be noted that Switzerland has adopted the OECD standard on administrative assistance and that the Federal Council rejects the automatic exchange of information. Since July 1, 2005, Switzerland has charged a <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> on all interest earned in the personal Swiss accounts of European Union residents.|$|E
25|$|Since World War II, {{the federal}} {{constitution}} authorizes the Confederation to levy {{a number of}} taxes, the most significant of which are an income tax, a <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> and a value added tax. However, Switzerland is unique among modern sovereign states in that the authority to levy these taxes is limited in duration and extent. The Constitution imposes an upper limit on the federal tax rates and causes the federal authority to levy taxes to expire in 2020. A renewal of that authority requires a constitutional amendment, which must be approved in a popular referendum by both {{a majority of the}} popular vote and the cantons. If that renewal is not approved at the polls (as it has been six times since 1958), the Confederation itself will conceivably dissolve for lack of funds. All attempts to remove this limitation by amending the constitution to provide for a permanent federal authority to levy taxes have been rejected in Parliament or – no less than five times – by popular vote, most recently in 1991.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{assesses the}} merits and {{limitations}} of raising <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> at source as a policy measure to address the increasingly serious problem of tax evasion connected with crossborder income flows from portfolio investment in the present globalized environment. Such taxes are effective in capturing passive income flows in an administratively simple way, but generate a number of distortions and give rise to international revenue redistribution and other spillover effects. On balance, however, the paper concludes that raising <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> should be seriously considered in a multilateral framework to combat tax evasion...|$|R
5000|$|Federal, state, {{and local}} <b>withholding</b> <b>taxes</b> are {{required}} in those jurisdictions imposing an income tax. Employers having {{contact with the}} jurisdiction must <b>withhold</b> the <b>tax</b> from wages paid to their employees in those jurisdictions.

500|$|Quashing orders {{may only}} be {{obtained}} against decisions which have some direct or indirect actual or ostensible legal effect, and not against mere opinions. In Comptroller of Income Tax v. ACC (2010), the respondent, a locally incorporated company, had arranged to enter into interest rate swap agreements with Singapore banks or Singapore branches of foreign banks on behalf of its offshore subsidiaries. The Comptroller of Income Tax took the position that payments made by the respondent to its subsidiaries pursuant to those swap agreements fell within the ambit of section 12(6) of the Income Tax Act, such that the <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> requirements imposed by section 45 of the same statute applied. As the respondent had not complied with the relevant <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> requirements {{with respect to the}} payments in question, the respondent was required to account to the Comptroller for the amount of tax which should have been withheld. This was conveyed to the respondent in a letter. The respondent sought leave to apply to quash the determination by the Comptroller. The Court of Appeal held that the Comptroller's letter was no more than advice to the respondent, and did not amount to a legal determination that <b>withholding</b> <b>tax</b> was due from the respondent. Thus, technically speaking, there was no determination to quash and the respondent should have applied for a declaration instead. However, since the parties had accepted a ruling by the High Court that the Comptroller's letter did amount to a legal determination of the respondent's tax liability and the Comptroller had not questioned this aspect of the High Court's judgment, the Court of Appeal proceeded on the basis that the letter did contain a determination that was judicially reviewable. It said that, [...] "given the particular circumstances of this case, for the court to require the respondent to recommence proceedings for a declaratory judgment would be to take an overly legalistic view of what procedural justice requires".|$|E
