5000|$|The {{function}} of the cam systems (known as the 'eccentrics') is to maximize the energy storage throughout the draw cycle and provide let-off {{at the end of}} the cycle (less holding weight at full draw). A traditional recurve bow has a very linear draw <b>weight</b> <b>curve</b> - meaning that as the bow is drawn back, the draw force becomes heavier with each inch of draw (and most difficult at full draw). Therefore, little energy is stored in the first half of the draw, and much more energy at the end where the draw weight is heaviest. The compound bow operates with a different weight profile, reaching its peak weight within the first few inches of the draw, and remaining more flat and constant until the end of the cycle where the cams [...] "let-off" [...] and allow a reduced holding weight. This manipulation of the peak weight throughout the draw (accomplished by the elliptical shape of the cams that change leverage and mechanical advantage) is why compound bows store more energy and shoot faster than an equivalent peak weight recurve bow or longbow.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop birth weight {{references}} for twins. Mean birth weights of individual twins are lower than those of singletons, hence singleton birth <b>weight</b> <b>curves</b> may not be suitable to assess twin birth weights. Study design: Twin birth <b>weight</b> <b>curves</b> were developed according to gestational age, gender, parity and mode of conception. The curves are based on population-based data of 40, 494 twins born in Flanders, Belgium between 1987 and 2007. Results: A different growth potential was found comparing the birth weights of twins and singletons. Twins deviate from the singleton curve from 30 weeks gestational age on. Conclusion: Our study underlines that singleton birth <b>weight</b> <b>curves</b> differ from twin birth <b>weight</b> <b>curves.</b> We developed specific twin birth <b>weight</b> <b>curves</b> can be used in clinical practice in order to follow growth patterns of twins in utero...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE:: To {{examine whether}} drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, and restrictive/binge eating-purging subtype at {{admission}} moderates the weight curves {{of patients with}} Anorexia Nervosa (AN) {{over the course of}} inpatient treatment. METHOD:: The nature of weight curves, individual differences herein and moderating factors are examined in 92 AN patients by means of multilevel modeling. RESULTS:: The average <b>weight</b> <b>curve</b> of AN patients is characterized by a linear weight increase during treatment that levels off near the end of treatment. Substantial individual differences exist in the shape of patients' weight curves. Patients with stronger body dissatisfaction at admission display a slower linear rate of weight gain over the course of treatment. Neither drive for thinness nor restrictive/binge eating-purging subtype predicted patients' <b>weight</b> <b>curve</b> over the course of treatment. DISCUSSION:: Body dissatisfaction moderates patients' weight curves over the course of inpatient treatment but more research on factors determining weight curves is needed.

40|$|Weight {{restoration}} is {{an important}} treatment goal {{that is at the}} heart of treatment in Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Recently, interest is growing in what constitutes an optimal <b>weight</b> <b>curve</b> for weight restoration over the course of treatment. In this study, we examined the nature of weight restoration curves in 92 AN patients in an inpatient, specialized treatment program and whether drive for thinness, body attitude and bulimic features at admission moderate patients’ weight curves over the course of treatment. Results indicate that the average <b>weight</b> <b>curve</b> of AN patients is characterized by a linear weight increase over the course of treatment that levels off near the end of treatment. There exist, however, substantial differences between AN patients in the nature of their weight restoration curves. It appears that patients with bulimic features have a higher body mass index (BMI) at admission whereas patients with a more negative body attitude display a slower linear weight gain during the course of treatment. Drive for thinness predicted neither BMI at admission nor the nature of the patients’ <b>weight</b> <b>curve</b> during treatment. The implications of this study for future research on weight monitoring in AN are discussed. Lay, B., Jennen-Steinmetz, J., Reinhard, I., & Schmidt, M. H. (2002).

40|$|Mice {{obtained}} from so-called "specific pathogen-free " colonies (SPF) and protected from contamination {{during the first}} 3 wk of their lives, are heavier at weaning time and become larger adults than mice of the same genetic stock raised under ordinary conditions of husbandry (1, 2). The <b>weight</b> <b>curve</b> of these SPF animals can be profoundly and lastingly depressed by contaminating them shortly after birth with a filterable, unidentified agent isolated from the intestinal tract of mice obtained {{a few years ago}} from commercial farms (3).

30|$|Note {{that when}} using {{weighted}} estimators, one effectively reduces the original sample size. For example, {{in the extreme}} case of binary zero or one valued weights, only the weights with value one contribute to the estimator which reduces the sample size to the percentage of one valued weights. In this example, we can find the percentage sample size reduction by approximating the area under each <b>weight</b> <b>curve.</b> In reference to the uniform weights which we take to have normalized area of 1, the HAC weights effectively reduce the sample size by PR: 31 %, BT,TK: 41 %, and QS: 54 % so that uniform weights have approximately {{two to three times}} the sample size of these weighting schemes.|$|E

The process of strong energy absorption during crack propagation, referred to as ductile deformation, is associated with the formation of shearlips. At 1 mm/s, the ductile deformation is initiated by necking during crack initiation; at 1 m/s ductile deformation precedes necking.

The <b>weighting</b> <b>curve</b> is misleading, inasmuch as it presumes inaudibility of flutters above 200 Hz, when actually faster flutters are quite damaging to the sound.
