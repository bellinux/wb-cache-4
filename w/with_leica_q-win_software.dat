40|$|A rapid {{non-destructive}} Image Analysis (IA) {{technique was}} developed for the determination of maize kernel endosperm vitreousness. Kernels were analysed using a Leica Q-Win Q 500 IW-DX Image Analyser fitted <b>with</b> <b>Leica</b> <b>Q-Win</b> <b>software</b> and connected to a Sony XC- 75 CCD camera. Kernel translucency measurements were optimised by using a light system that involved positioning whole kernels {{on top of a}} mask containing round illuminated areas (circles), smaller than the projected areas of the kernels, allowing light to shine through the kernels only. Correction factors allowing for constant illumination of kernels were developed to adjust for kernel size variation in relation to constant light area. Similarly, a correction factor for the effect of kernel thickness on detected translucency values were developed. Significant correlations were found between corrected translucency values and vitreous and opaque endosperm yields as determined by hand dissection. These were: translucency {{as a percentage of the}} whole kernel and vitreous endosperm (mass%) (Translucency 1), r = 0. 77, p 3. 9 mm was 0. 67, p< 0. 001. The IA technique permits the non-destructive analysis of maize endosperm translucency on large samples of single kernels. It is suitable for rapid quantification of maize endosperm contents and predicting dry maize milling performance, as kernel translucency was significantly correlated with vitreousness in all instances. With further development of specific hardware and software, the technique has potential as an on¬line maize kernel classification system in industrial mills. As the method is non¬destructive, it is also suitable for classification of maize seed breeding material. It is also a potential method for the measurement of maize opacity as used by the wet milling industry, where opacity (the opposite of vitreousness) is related to maize starch yield.

40|$|The {{automatic}} target {{recognition and}} fine tracking demonstrate {{the high level}} of an instrument's automation since the measurements are performed completely automated. The present work gives a comparison of measurements, measuring accuracy and adjustment results between two instruments, Leica Geosystems TC 2003 with manual tracking and instrument Leica Geosystems TCRP 1201 R 300 with automatic target tracking. The measurements <b>with</b> <b>Leica</b> Geosystems TC 2003 were carried out in three sets of angles whereas <b>with</b> <b>Leica</b> Geosystems TCRP 1201 R 300, they were carried out in 16 sets of angles. All analyses of monitoring and measuring accuracy on Leica Geosystems TCRP 1201 R 300 were carried out in sets. The first set was obtained by taking the first three sets of angles into account, the second set by taking account of the first four sets of angles, and so on. Based on the accuracy analysis of performed measurements it could be determined that in terms of accuracy the automatic target tracking is comparable to manual measurements. Finally, a comparison and an analysis of measuring results obtained by both instruments were carried out...|$|R
