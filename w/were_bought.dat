60|$|We might, therefore, à priori, {{conjecture}} (as {{we shall}} ultimately find) that it cannot <b>be</b> <b>bought,</b> nor sold. Everything else <b>is</b> <b>bought</b> and sold for Labour, but labour itself cannot <b>be</b> <b>bought</b> nor sold for anything, being priceless.[80] The {{idea that it}} is a commodity to <b>be</b> <b>bought</b> or sold, <b>is</b> the alpha and omega of Politico-Economic fallacy.|$|R

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war Norsk Hydro had {{a strong}} liquidity, while the Green Revolution and {{increased}} industrialization of agriculture in Europe boomed the demand for the products; from 1945 to 1955 production increased eightfold. The increased transport was a heavy burden on the two steamships, and in 1953 Norsk Transport ordered MF Storegut, a diesel powered ship of 1119 gross tonnes. She was launched on 25 May 1956, and the two older ferries were put to reserve duty in the meantime. A number of upgrades were made to the line, and the two locomotives 9 and 10 <b>were</b> <b>bought</b> in 1958. This was followed by the three diesel locomotives 20, 21 and 22 from Henschel. In 1966 two NSB El 1 locomotives <b>were</b> <b>bought,</b> and the voltage on the line increased from 10 to 15 kV.|$|E
5|$|After {{the line}} had {{been relegated to}} a branch line, traffic fell considerably. Another factor was car traffic, which {{did not exist in}} Flekkefjord until 1918, but {{thereafter}} became widespread. After the war, Class 20 steam locomotives were used on the line. During the 1940, several railcars of Class 87 were taken into use, and soon all passenger trains were operated using such units. From 1956 to 1966, also Class 86 units were used on the line, but the narrow profile of the tunnels made operations problematic. Class 87 remained in service until 1981, when used Class 89 units <b>were</b> <b>bought</b> from Sweden. At first, two Y7 units were brought to Norway on 23 January and taken into service on 24 February. After they proved to work well, NSB bought them for 95,000 Swedish kronor plus freight. Two more units <b>were</b> <b>bought</b> in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Conisbrough {{fell into}} ruin, its outer wall badly {{affected}} by subsidence, {{and was given}} to the Carey family in the 16th century.

5|$|Henry VIII {{gave the}} ruins to the Carey family, who {{retained}} {{it until it}} passed by marriage into first the Heviningham and then the Coke families.
