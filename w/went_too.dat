5|$|On July 1, 1922, 400,000 {{railroad}} workers went on strike. Harding {{proposed a}} settlement that made some concessions, but management objected. Attorney General Daugherty convinced Judge James H. Wilkerson {{to issue a}} sweeping injunction {{to break up the}} strike. Although there was public support for the Wilkerson injunction, Harding felt it <b>went</b> <b>too</b> far, and had Daugherty and Wilkerson amend it. The injunction succeeded in ending the strike; however, tensions remained high between railroad workers and management for years.|$|E
5|$|Secretariat, Sham, Pvt. Smiles, and My Gallant {{were the}} first four horses to be entered into the Belmont Stakes. Secretariat, winner of both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, was the odds on {{favorite}} to win the event. The added distance of the Belmont {{when compared to the}} Derby and Preakness was found to be one potential reason for Secretariat to lose the race. Steve Cady of the New York Times wrote that Secretariat could be defeated if the pace of the race <b>went</b> <b>too</b> fast or was too slow for too long, in both of which scenarios he felt Sham would win. Sham received significant attention as well and was thought to be the second best horse, along with having the potential of becoming the first horse to be runner-up in all the Triple Crown races. My Gallant was considered the best of the rest, especially as he was the progeny of Gallant Man, who set the Belmont Stakes course record of 2: in the 1957 edition.|$|E
5|$|Stojadinović sought {{authority}} from Prince Paul {{to form a}} new cabinet, however Korošec as head of the Senate advised the prince {{to form a new}} government around Cvetković. Prince Paul dismissed Stojadinović and appointed Cvetković in his place, with a direction that he reach an agreement with Maček. While these negotiations were ongoing, Italy invaded Albania. In August 1939, the Cvetković–Maček Agreement was concluded to create the Banovina of Croatia, which was to be a relatively autonomous political unit within Yugoslavia. Separatist Croats considered the Agreement did not go far enough, and many Serbs believed it <b>went</b> <b>too</b> far in giving power to Croats. The Cvetković-led cabinet formed {{in the wake of the}} Agreement was resolutely anti-Axis, and included five members of the HSS, with Maček as deputy Prime Minister. General Milan Nedić was Minister of the Army and Navy. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, German pressure on the government resulted in the resignation in mid-1940 of the Minister of the Interior, Dr. Stanoje Mihaldžić, who had been organising covert anti-Axis activities. In October 1940, Simović was again approached by plotters planning a coup but he was non-committal. From the outbreak of war British diplomacy focused on keeping Yugoslavia neutral, which the Ambassador Ronald Campbell apparently still believed possible.|$|E

25|$|Bennett's conversion, however, {{was seen}} as too little too late, and he faced {{criticism}} that his reforms either <b>went</b> <b>too</b> far, or did not go far enough, including {{from one of his}} cabinet ministers H. H. Stevens, who bolted the government to form the Reconstruction Party of Canada. Some of the measures were alleged to have encroached on provincial jurisdictions laid out in section 92 of the British North America Act. The courts, including the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, agreed and eventually struck down virtually all of Bennett's reforms. However, some of Bennett's initiatives, such as the Bank of Canada, which he founded in 1934, remain in place to this day, and the Canadian Wheat Board remained in place until 2011 when the government of Stephen Harper abolished it.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} was dramatically altered, however, when Trujillo {{was assassinated in}} May 1961. Trujillo's son, Ramfis, initially inherited power with Balaguer as his puppet. They initially took steps to liberalize the regime, granting some civil liberties and easing Trujillo's tight censorship of the press. Meanwhile, he revoked the nonaggression pact made with Cuba in January 1961. These measures did not go nearly far enough for a populace who had no memory of the instability and poverty that preceded Trujillo, and wanted more freedom and a more equitable distribution of wealth. At the same time, Ramfis' reforms <b>went</b> <b>too</b> far for the hard-line trujillistas led by his own uncles, Héctor and José Arismendi Trujillo. As the OAS continued economic sanctions imposed for Trujillo's attempted murder of Venezuelan President Romulo Betancourt, Ramfis warned that the country could descend into civil war between left and right.|$|E

25|$|Those mining {{communities}} {{had good}} working class values {{and a sense}} of family values. The men did real men's heavy work going down the pit. There were also some very close-knit communities which were able to deal with the few troublesome kids. If they had any problems they would take the kid round the back and give them a good clip round the ear {{and that would be the}} end of that. Many of these communities were completely devastated, with people out of work turning to drugs and no real man's work because all the jobs had gone. There is no doubt that this led to a breakdown in these communities with families breaking up and youths going out of control. The scale of the closures <b>went</b> <b>too</b> far. The damage done to those communities was enormous as a result of the strike.|$|E
25|$|After the {{armistice}} was signed on 21 June 1940, de Gaulle spoke at 8pm on 22 June to denounce it. The Bordeaux government declared him compulsorily retired (with {{the rank of}} colonel) on 23 June 1940. On 23 June the British Government denounced the Armistice as a breach of the Anglo-French treaty signed in March, and stated {{that they no longer}} regarded the Bordeaux Government as a fully independent state. They also “took note” of the plan to establish a French National Committee (FNC) in exile, but did not specifically mention de Gaulle by name. Jean Monnet broke with de Gaulle on 23 June, as he thought his appeal was “too personal” and <b>went</b> <b>too</b> far, and that French opinion would not rally to a man who was seen to be operating from British soil. He said he had warned the Foreign Office officials Alexander Cadogan and Robert Vansittart, as well as Edward Spears, of his concerns about de Gaulle. Monnet soon resigned as head of the Inter-Allied Commission and departed for the USA. De Gaulle broadcast again on 24 June.|$|E
25|$|By 1998, Lawler rarely {{wrestled}} in the WWF {{and focused}} on commentary. Despite their feud in the USWA in 1993, by 1998, Vince McMahon had turned heel in the WWF {{for the first time}} and left the announce position, to which Lawler began praising McMahon's name on commentary as part of his own heel persona, much to the chagrin of Jim Ross. It was McMahon's departure from the commentary team which led to the strong on-screen chemistry between Lawler and Ross in subsequent years. This played a key role in a change of Lawler's character; although he still supported the heels, he showed a sense of right and wrong, and would condemn actions of heels when they <b>went</b> <b>too</b> far. He would become a full-time face by 2007. This began when Lawler surprisingly attacked Tazz when he started bullying Ross. At SummerSlam, The King wrestled Tazz in defense of Ross. With the creation of the XFL in 2001, Lawler was given the job as an announcer for the new football league. Lawler claims that he never wanted to announce for the XFL (he would admit on-air that he knew and cared almost nothing about the sport), but that he agreed to it after McMahon and Kevin Dunn asked him.|$|E

Redding, [...] The Court ruled that a school <b>went</b> <b>too</b> far in ordering a 13-year-old female student to strip to her bra and underpants so that female officials could search for drugs. In an interview published prior to the Court's decision, Ginsburg shared her view that some of her colleagues did not fully appreciate {{the effect of a}} strip search on a 13-year-old girl. As she pointed out, [...] "They have never been a 13-year-old girl." [...] In an 8–1 decision, the Court agreed that the school's search <b>went</b> <b>too</b> far and violated the Fourth Amendment and allowed the student's lawsuit against the school to go forward. Only Ginsburg and Justice Stevens would have allowed the student to sue individual school officials as well.|$|E
