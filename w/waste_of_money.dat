5|$|Another {{meeting on}} the issue was called on 6 December 1966, {{attended}} by Johnson, McNamara, the deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance, Walt Rostow of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Joint Chiefs. Rostow took {{the side of the}} JCS and it appeared that development would start. However, McNamara once again outlined the problems and stated that the simplest way to close the ABM gap was to simply build more ICBMs, rendering the Soviet system impotent and a great <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> He then proposed that the money sidelined by Congress for deployment be used for initial deployment studies while the US attempted to negotiate an arms limitation treaty. Johnson agreed with this compromise, and ordered Secretary of State Dean Rusk to open negotiations with the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{was highly}} {{alarmed by the}} Brazilian move, and they quickly moved to nullify the {{remaining}} months of the naval-limiting restrictions in the 1902 pact with Chile. In November 1906, Argentina's Minister of Foreign Affairs, , remarked that {{any one of the}} new Brazilian vessels could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets. Despite the seeming hyperbole, his statement—made before the Brazilian government reordered the ships as dreadnoughts—ended up being close to the truth: in 1910, at least, the new Brazilian warships were seemingly stronger than any other vessel in the world, let alone any one ship in the Argentine or Chilean fleets. With this in mind, the Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers opined that maintaining the older Libertad class or Capitán Prat (respectively) was now a <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E
5|$|Curing {{the leaks}} and {{cleaning}} up the contamination delayed the tunnel's completion by a year, and it was finally opened on 22 August 1999. The entire process was further complicated by conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the Scandinavian Rock Group. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during the incidents, which should have been addressed in 1995, but were never taken seriously. Compensation was paid for approximately 60 houses which were damaged {{as a result of}} tunnel construction. An evaluation by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was spent fixing the leaks, but the report claimed that this was to a large extent a <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> resulting from inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the construction of the entire railway. In total the extraordinary additional costs for the tunnel totaled NOK1.3 billion.|$|E

5|$|The {{substance}} Rhoca-Gil {{was used}} to fix the leakages, but the substance failed to work properly. Not only did it fail to polymerize and stop the leaks, it also contaminated the surroundings with acrylamide. The entire process of fixing the leak and cleaning up the toxicity delayed {{the process of building}} the tunnel by one year; and it was first opened on 22 August 1999. Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during incidents that should have been addressed in 1995, and were never taken seriously. About sixty houses received damage due to the construction of the tunnel. An evaluation performed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was used on fixing the leaks; however, the report claimed this was, to a large extent, a <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> due to inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the entire construction of the railway.|$|E
25|$|According to {{an article}} in Foreign Policy, many Chinese view this $278 million {{expenditure}} for an overseas soft-power initiative as a <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> which would be better spent on building schools in poor rural areas of China.|$|E
25|$|When Korolev died in January 1966, his {{notoriously}} incompetent deputy Vasily Mishin {{took over}} his design bureau. Mishin {{succeeded in getting}} the Kremlin to terminate the UR-700/900 project {{as well as the}} RD-270 engine Glushko planned for the launch vehicle family. His main arguments were the tremendous safety risk posed by a low-altitude launch failure of the UR-700 in addition to the <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> by developing two HLV families at once.|$|E

25|$|In Germany, anti-smoking groups, often {{associated}} with anti-liquor groups, first published advocacy against the consumption of tobacco in the journal Der Tabakgegner (The Tobacco Opponent) in 1912 and 1932. In 1929, Fritz Lickint of Dresden, Germany, published a paper containing formal statistical evidence of a lung cancer–tobacco link. During the Great Depression Adolf Hitler condemned his earlier smoking habit as a <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> and later with stronger assertions. This movement was further strengthened with Nazi reproductive policy as women who smoked were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a German family.|$|E
25|$|In the North of England particularly, {{there was}} fierce resistance; {{the local people}} {{considered}} that the existing system there was running smoothly. They argued {{that the nature of}} cyclical unemployment meant that any new workhouse built would be empty for most of the year and thus a <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> However, the unlikely union between property owners and paupers did not last, and opposition, though fierce, eventually petered out. In some cases, this was further accelerated as the protests very successfully undermined parts of the Amendment Act and became obsolete.|$|E
25|$|The Davis {{campaign}} {{tried to}} run against the recall Yes/No vote instead of against the candidates that were trying to replace him. Davis tried to depict the recall as a $66 million <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> that could allow a candidate with {{a very small percentage}} of the vote to become Governor—potentially someone who was very liberal or conservative. There are no primaries in a recall election. Davis {{tried to run}} “outside the recall circus” and to make himself appear gubernatorial and hard at work for California, and who had made improvements to education and healthcare. Early August polls showed that over 50% supported the recall.|$|E

25|$|With the {{modernization}} of cigarette production compounded with the increased life expectancies during the 1920s, adverse health effects began to become more prevalent. In Germany, anti-smoking groups, often associated with anti-liquor groups, first published advocacy against the consumption of tobacco in the journal Der Tabakgegner (The Tobacco Opponent) in 1912 and 1932. In 1929, Fritz Lickint of Dresden, Germany, published a paper containing formal statistical evidence of a lung cancer–tobacco link.

25|$|Hugh White, {{a former}} leading defence planner for the Hawke and Howard Governments, ANU Professor and defence {{writer for the}} SMH, {{has long been a}} critic of the {{decision}} to acquire the Canberra-class ships. In 2004 he argued that the Australian Defence Force did not need the capacity to conduct a major opposed amphibious operation, as it was unlikely to ever be called upon to do so, and the money needed to purchase the vessels would be better spent on smaller amphibious ships and other defence capabilities. In 2016 White judged the ships to be a 'terrible and heroic, <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and nothing more than, 'big, fat... targets in the South China Sea'. which are too vulnerable for deployment in a serious crisis.|$|E
25|$|Light rail in the Salt Lake Valley {{was first}} seriously {{discussed}} in the late 1980s to provide an alternative to traffic congestion on I-15, but the idea was met with criticism. On October 10, 1988, Congress approved $5 million in funds to preserve land along the proposed light rail corridor. Funding for the light rail line, however, remained uncertain. After Salt Lake City won the bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics in 1995, UTA used the city's host status to accelerate obtaining funding through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Construction began in 1997. Protesters at the groundbreaking insisted light rail would be dangerous and a <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> Public opinion remained divided and businesses on Main Street in downtown Salt Lake City suffered during the construction period.|$|E

25|$|The Parachute Regiment {{had their}} own {{distinctive}} uniform: the maroon beret at first with the Army Air Corps cap badge and from May 1943 the Parachute Regiment cap badge which is still in use today. Parachute wings were worn on the right shoulder above the airborne forces patch of Bellerophon riding the flying horse Pegasus. On operations, Paras wore the airborne forces pattern steel helmet instead of the normal Brodie helmet. Initially they wore a 'jump jacket' modelled on the German Fallschirmjäger jacket. After 1942, the Denison smock was issued as the first camouflaged uniform for the British Army. In 1943, a green sleeveless jacket was designed to wear over the Denison smock when parachuting. British Paras did not use a reserve parachute, as the War Office considered the £60 cost a <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E
25|$|Concerned about {{corruption}} in Chinese science, some Chinese scientists, including Professor Liu Ming 刘明 of Zhejiang University in his 2005 book Critique of the Academic Evaluation System 学术评价制度批判, argue that interference from {{government officials and}} university bureaucrats makes peer review far less effective in China than it could be. The time scientists spend cultivating politically influential people is lost to scientific research. Liu argues that the command economy mentality of measuring everything by the numbers combined with pervasive political interference results in a great <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> human talent as well as considerable {{corruption in}} Chinese science. A 2008 investigation into a certification for high-tech enterprises allowing large tax breaks and other advantages {{found that more than}} 70% of the enterprises had gained this under questionable circumstances and an investigation of a sample found that 73% did not pass the requirements.|$|E

500|$|After {{the lengthy}} {{political}} wrangling over the design had passed, {{the criticism of}} the scheme died down. Menzies strongly denounced the [...] "moaning" [...] by opponents of the lake. Most critics decried the project as a <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> {{that should have been}} spent on essential services across Australia. Less strident concerns centred on the potentially negative effects of the lake, such as mosquitoes, ecological degeneration, siltation and the possibility that the lake would create fog. The latter of these concerns has proven to be unfounded.|$|E

Kenrick, however, dislikes the adaptation: [...] "You {{certainly}} won't ever want to put this disaster in your player, {{unless you want to}} hear the sound of Rodgers and Hammerstein whirling in their graves.
