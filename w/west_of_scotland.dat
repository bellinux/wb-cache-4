5|$|Coal {{and other}} {{minerals}} were extracted in the <b>west</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland</b> from medieval times; getting the heavy product to market {{was always a}} challenge, and this encouraged the development of tracked systems; the earliest plateways {{in the vicinity of}} Ayr date from—at the latest—1775.|$|E

5|$|Four {{days after}} the Scotland Test the All Blacks faced <b>West</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland</b> in Glasgow. The cities' {{secondary}} schools were given half a day off to watch the match. The All Blacks scored six tries {{on the way to}} a 22–0 victory. The team then travelled to Ireland, for their third Test.|$|E
5|$|Macartney {{then made}} 106 in a non-first-class match against the <b>West</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland,</b> before hitting 109 in the Fourth Test at Old Trafford in a rain-affected draw; the match {{failed to reach}} the second innings. Macartney had scored three centuries in as many innings.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days later}} the {{tourists}} played a <b>West</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland</b> selection, where they received a much warmer reception than for the Scotland match, then travelled via Belfast to Dublin where they faced Ireland. Gallaher did not play in either match due to a leg injury suffered during the Scotland Test. New Zealand won the Ireland match 15–0, then defeated a team representing Munster province.|$|E

5|$|Scotland contested {{the first}} ever {{international}} football game in 1872 against England. The match took place at Hamilton Crescent, Glasgow, home of the <b>West</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland</b> Cricket Club. Scottish clubs {{have been successful in}} European competitions with Celtic winning the European Cup in 1967, Rangers and Aberdeen winning the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1972 and 1983 respectively, and Aberdeen also winning the UEFA Super Cup in 1983.|$|E
5|$|By 1835 {{the idea}} of {{building}} a railway from Glasgow into Ayrshire gained sufficient support for a survey to be commissioned from John Miller, {{a partner in the}} firm of Grainger and Miller, which had been heavily involved in the earlier railways in the <b>west</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland.</b> Miller proposed a route from Tradeston, in Glasgow {{at the south end of}} Glasgow Bridge, through Paisley and the Garnock Valley to Kilwinning and Ayr, with a branch from Dalry to Kilmarnock. The cost was to be £550,000 and a 10% return could be expected; notwithstanding the south-westerly course of the line, it was foreseen as a first step towards linking with railways in England.|$|E
5|$|From about 1790 {{textiles}} {{became the}} most important industry in the <b>west</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland,</b> especially the spinning and weaving of cotton, which flourished until in 1861 the American Civil War cut off the supplies of raw cotton. The industry never recovered, {{but by that time}} Scotland had developed heavy industries based on its coal and iron resources. The invention of the hot blast for smelting iron (1828) revolutionised the Scottish iron industry. As a result, Scotland became a centre for engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives. Toward the end of the 19th century, steel production largely replaced iron production.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, the {{extractive}} industries of the <b>West</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland</b> underwent a metamorphosis. The small pits were either worked out or were mechanised and merged. A similar process took place in the iron and steel production industries, and the medium scale iron works in many locations closed down. Many railway branch lines had been heavily dependent on business from the mineral industries, and could not be sustained when they had gone, but some continued as passenger lines where they served sizable communities.|$|E
5|$|That summer, Victoria and Albert spent a rainy {{holiday in}} the <b>west</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland</b> at Loch Laggan, but heard from their doctor, Sir James Clark, {{that his son}} had enjoyed dry, sunny days farther east at Balmoral Castle. The tenant of Balmoral, Sir Robert Gordon, died {{suddenly}} in early October, and Albert began negotiations {{to take over the}} lease from the owner, the Earl Fife. In May the following year, Albert leased Balmoral, which he had never visited, and in September 1848 he, his wife and the older children went there for the first time. They came to relish the privacy it afforded.|$|E
5|$|The Jags {{flirted with}} a number of colour schemes in their early years. From their {{inception}} until 1900 the kits were predominantly blue with red and white trimmings. There was then a brief period in which the players wore an orange and black striped top with white shorts and black socks. This was replaced in 1905 by a colour scheme close to that used by Aston Villa, before the club reverted to the predominantly blue kits in 1909. In season 1936–37 they changed to, and settled upon, the red-yellow-and-black attire for which they are best known, this change having been triggered initially by the club borrowing kits from the local rugby union team, <b>West</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland</b> Football Club.|$|E

5|$|Malcolm's kingdom did {{not extend}} over the full {{territory}} of modern Scotland: the north and <b>west</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland</b> remained under Scandinavian, Norse-Gael, and Gaelic rule, and the territories {{under the rule of}} the Kings of Scots {{did not extend}} much beyond the limits established by Malcolm II until the 12th century. Malcolm III fought a series of wars against the Kingdom of England, which may have had as its objective the conquest of the English earldom of Northumbria. These wars did not result in any significant advances southward. Malcolm's primary achievement was to continue a lineage that ruled Scotland for many years, although his role as founder of a dynasty {{has more to do with}} the propaganda of his youngest son David I and his descendants than with history.|$|E
5|$|The Clan Class {{was based}} upon the Britannia Class design, {{incorporating}} a smaller boiler and various weight-saving measures to increase the route availability of a Pacific-type locomotive for its intended area of operations, the <b>west</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scotland.</b> The Clan Class received a mixed reception from crews, with those regularly operating the locomotives giving favourable reports as regards performance. However, trials {{in other areas of}} the British Railways network returned negative feedback, a common complaint being that difficulty in steaming the locomotive made it hard to adhere to timetables. Reports exist that suggest a degree of the disappointment with these locomotives was attributable to their being allocated to Class 7 work where they were only a Class 6 in reality; a problem put down to their very similar appearance to the BR Standard Class 7.|$|E
