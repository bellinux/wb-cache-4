5|$|Mike B. Anderson {{stated that}} at least three {{different}} acts of material were written and animated for Krusty's comeback stand-up appearance at Moe's Tavern. It {{was not until the}} editing process that the material used was decided upon. The episode was still being animated three weeks before it was due to air and the production process moved frantically shortly before completion. The Canyonero sequence was originally planned to be displayed during the closing credits. The production team liked the scene so much that they did not <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> obscured by the credits and gave it its own segment {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|In March 1933, {{less than}} three months after the Nazis seized power, Himmler set up the first {{official}} concentration camp at Dachau. Hitler had stated that he did not <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> just another prison or detention camp. Himmler appointed Theodor Eicke, a convicted felon and ardent Nazi, to run the camp in June 1933. Eicke devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany. Its features included isolation of victims from the outside world, elaborate roll calls and work details, the use of force and executions to exact obedience, and a strict disciplinary code for the guards. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards alike; the guards' uniforms had a special Totenkopf (death's head) insignia on their collars. By the end of 1934, Himmler took control of the camps {{under the aegis of the}} SS, creating a separate division, the SS-Totenkopfverbände.|$|E

25|$|Before the 16th century, the Igbo had a {{pictogram}} form {{of writing}} called “Nsibidi”. That form died out, most likely {{because many of}} its users were members of secret societies and did not <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> public. In 1854, A German philologist named Karl Richard Lepsius made a “Standard Alphabet”, meant for all the languages of the world. In 1882, Britain enacted an educational ordinance to direct the teaching of reading and writing only in English which temporarily inhibited the development of Igbo along with other languages of West Africa.|$|E
25|$|Some days later, Bhim Chand sent {{a message}} to Anandpur, asking the Guru to lend the Prasadi {{elephant}} to him. Bhim Chand wanted the elephant to make a display of his wealth to the guests at his son's proposed wedding. The Guru suspected that Bhim Chand wanted to gain permanent possession of the elephant, and declined the Raja's demand. He stated that the devotee who had presented the elephant didn't <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> given away to anybody else. Bhim Chand is said to have sent his emissaries thrice to the Guru, the last one being Raja Kesari Chand of Jaswal. However, the Guru didn't accept his demand, and refused to part with the elephant.|$|E

They <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Scouting, but a version that would <b>be</b> viewed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> different from traditional Scouting.

5000|$|In 1988, {{shortly after}} the release of their second album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, Public Enemy were {{preparing}} for the European leg of the Run's House tour with Run-D.M.C. Before embarking on the tour, film director Spike Lee approached Public Enemy with the proposition of making a song for one of his movies. Lee, who was directing Do the Right Thing, sought to use the song as a leitmotif in the film about racial tension in a Brooklyn, New York neighborhood. He said of his decision in a subsequent interview for Time, [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> defiant, I <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> angry, I <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very rhythmic. I thought right away of Public Enemy". At a meeting in Lower Manhattan, Lee told lead MC Chuck D, producer Hank Shocklee of The Bomb Squad, and executive producer Bill Stephney that he needed an anthemic song for the film.|$|R
25|$|Although bearing some {{resemblance}} to the jet powered Avro Tudor 8 and 9 (the former flying on jet power in 1948 and the latter becoming the experimental Avro Ashton first flying in 1950), Floyd's design was conceived from the outset as a commercial jet airliner. The updated design was presented in October 1948, and in February 1948 TCA responded with changes of their own. Now they wanted the aircraft to cruise at , and they increased the fuel requirements to allow for wider diversions. In April, Gordon McGregor took over the presidency of TCA, and told Smye {{that he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the first airline with a jet. Nevertheless, the project pressed on, and was the topic of a major article in Aviation Week that November.|$|E
25|$|Bourassa {{left the}} federal {{parliament}} on May 11, 1907, but remained active in Quebec politics being {{elected to the}} Legislative Assembly of Quebec in the 1908 provincial election in Montréal division no. 2, leading the Ligue Nationaliste until retiring from the assembly on September 5, 1912. He continued to criticize Laurier because his compromises were mostly helping the British Empire, opposing Laurier's attempts to build a Canadian navy in 1911, which he believed would draw Canada into future imperial wars between Britain and Germany. He supported the eventual creation of an independent navy, but did not <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> under British command, as Laurier had planned. Bourassa's attacks depleted Laurier's strength in Quebec, contributing to the Liberal Party's loss in the 1911 election. Ironically, Bourassa's moves aided in {{the election of the}} Conservatives, who held more staunchly Imperialist policies than the Liberals.|$|E
25|$|The {{time machine}} went through several {{variations}} during {{production of the}} first film, Back to the Future. In {{the first draft of}} the screenplay, the time machine was a laser device that was housed in a room. At {{the end of the first}} draft the device was attached to a refrigerator and taken to an atomic bomb test site. Director Robert Zemeckis said in an interview that the idea was scrapped because he did not want children to start climbing into refrigerators and getting trapped inside. In the third draft of the film the time machine was a car, as Zemeckis reasoned that if you were going to make a time machine, you would <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mobile. The specific choice of vehicle was a DeLorean DMC-12 for the purposes of it looking like an alien spaceship due to its characteristic gullwing doors (which were inspired by the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL). However, in order to send Marty back to the future, the vehicle had to drive into a nuclear test site. Ultimately this concept was considered too expensive to film, so the power source was changed to lightning.|$|E

Harkening back to the early '90s, when Madonna, En Vogue, Whitney Houston and TLC were making very empowering music for women and the gay community and all kind of disenfranchised communities, the lyrics and the melodies were very poignant and very gospel and very spiritual and I said, 'That's the kind of record I need to make. That's the record that's going to shake up the industry.' It's not about the track. It's not about the production. It's about the song. Anyone could sing 'Born This Way'.

500|$|The {{read-through}} for {{the episode}} {{took place in}} September 2009. Though {{it is the first}} episode of the series, [...] "The Eleventh Hour" [...] was not the first to be shot. It was filmed in the third production block, after the completion of episodes 2-5. As Smith was aware of how his Doctor would act in the following episodes, he used this one to establish the character. The plan was to retain traces of Smith's predecessor, but the executive producers wanted Smith to be [...] "stranger". The episode was directed by Adam Smith, who was attracted to the [...] "brilliant script" [...] and working with Matt Smith after seeing him on stage. Smith was asked to direct [...] "the same but make it a bit different– the producers didn't <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> radically different, but they did <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> different". The goal was to make it more [...] "cinematic" [...] and magical, and Smith took inspiration from E.T. and Tim Burton's work.|$|E
