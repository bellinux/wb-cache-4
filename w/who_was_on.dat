5|$|After {{dinner on}} 8 September, the guests at Tranby Croft listened to music from Ethel Lycett Green until about 11pm, when the prince {{suggested}} {{a game of}} baccarat. Although the Wilsons {{did not have a}} suitably-sized table, Stanley Wilson improvised, putting two card tables alongside the smoking room table—all of which were of differing sizes—and covered them with a tapestry cloth. Among the evening's players were the prince, who acted as dealer; Sassoon, who took the part of banker; and Gordon-Cumming.

5|$|American Philo McGiffin, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> board Zhenyuan, {{reported}} {{after the}} battle {{that there had been}} a variety of stories about the fate of the ship, but one that the survivors agreed on was the tale of the interaction between Captain Deng and his dog. As the ship went down, the captain ended up clinging to a piece of debris. However, his dog swam to him. Deng released the debris, and unable to swim, he drowned along with the dog. Chinese sources have subsequently stated Captain Deng made the decision to go down with Zhiyuan. In this retelling, the dog attempted to drag him to safety, but he refused to be moved and both died.|$|E

5|$|Auriemma {{found himself}} in a {{national}} debate following a decision he made during the 1997–98 season. Senior Nykesha Sales suffered a season-ending injury in one of the final games of the regular season. At the time of her injury, she was only one point shy of Kerry Bascom's school scoring record. The next game, with Bascom's blessing, and assistance from friend and Villanova head coach Harry Paretta, Auriemma arranged to have Sales, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> crutches, score a basket and then allow Villanova to score a basket to start the game at 2–2. Sales then held the school scoring record.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its first-choice team in {{the tour}} opener, which was usually against Worcestershire. Bradman and his co-selectors felt that Loxton was not among the 11 strongest players, so he was not selected against Worcestershire. Loxton’s debut had come about because first-choice opener Arthur Morris had been rested from the Fifth Test so that the selectors could trial potential players for the 1948 tour. Sid Barnes had opened in that match with Bill Brown. Morris and Barnes were Bradman's preferred pair and they opened against Worcestershire, while Brown, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> his third tour of England, was played out of position in the middle-order, pushing Loxton out of the team. Loxton looked on as Brown made 25 and Australia won by an innings.|$|E

5|$|Edwards is a far-right {{political}} activist from Memphis, Tennessee, {{described by the}} Southern Poverty Law Center as a rising star of the modern white-nationalist movement. They write that he is articulate, charming, and at ease {{in front of the}} public, as well as in television and radio studios. He attended Briarcrest Christian School, a private school in Memphis, and in ninth grade transferred into a Christian-nationalist homeschooling program, a decision that he said led him into political activism. In 2000 he volunteered for Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign, and in 2002 ran unsuccessfully for the Tennessee House of Representatives. It was during this campaign that he met fellow activist Austin Farley, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the ballot against him. In October of that year, he and Farley established The Political Cesspool.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} these {{valuable}} contributions to the Spartan cause, Alcibiades fell out of favor with the Spartan government at around this time, ruled by Agis II. Leotychides, the son born by Agis's wife Timaia shortly after this, was believed {{by many to be}} Alcibiades's son. Alcibiades's influence was further reduced after the retirement of Endius, the ephor <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> good terms with him. It is alleged that Astiochus, a Spartan Admiral, was sent orders to kill him, but Alcibiades received warning of this order and defected to the Persian satrap Tissaphernes, who had been supporting the Peloponnesian forces financially in 412 BC.|$|E
