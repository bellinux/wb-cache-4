40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{sedimentology}} and stratigraphy of a freshwater wet-land {{in early}} Pleistocene (; 1. 75 Ma) volcaniclastic deposits, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, are characterized using texture, mineralogy, micro-fossils, and stratigraphic description {{to create a}} depositional facies model. The freshwater wetland was located on the margin of a semi-arid, closed basin containing a playa lake. The lake-margin deposits are dominated by two distinct lithologies: waxy claystones and earthy sediments. Waxy sediments are olive green, dense claystones that con-tain authigenic minerals such as trona, and represent a fluctuating saline, alkaline lake (Hay 1976). Earthy sediments are beige, friable siltstones that contain siliceous microfossils, bone fragments, and minor pebbles; they represent the freshwater wetland. Microfossils from the earthy sediments and diatomites indicate freshwater marsh biota with some rare salt-tolerant species. Associated lithofacies are: diatomite, carbonate, and sandstone. Interpretation of vertical and lateral lithofacies variations in the 2 km 2 wetland, based on; 50 excavations, identified seven distinct sub-environments: spring deposits, perennial marsh, pool, ephemeral wet-land, fringing <b>wetland,</b> <b>wetland</b> channel, and ephemeral stream. The stratigraphic sequence, estimated to represent an; 40 – 50 kyr long interval, indicates that persistent (; 103 yr) wet periods prevailed dur-ing the deposition of thick waxy clays when the lake expanded and flooded the wetlands, and equally long intervening dry periods caused the lake to contract, allowing the flourishing of wetlands and accretion of earthy sediment. The lithofacies associations in the Olduvai paleo-wetland provides {{an important first step}} {{in the development of a}} de-positional environmental model for freshwater wetlands that can be tested elsewhere, particularly in arid and semiarid settings...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. (Aquatic Health) Abstract: Wetlands are {{amongst the}} most {{productive}} ecosystems in the natural world. Important biogeochemical and hydrological functions, such as nutrient cycling and organic carbon sequestration, {{are the result of}} a wetlands ability to moderate groundwater flow. Colbyn Valley is an urban wetland in the heart of Pretoria, South Africa that has been under threat due to urban development and pressure from Tshwane City Council. The wetland contains a 4. 68 ha component of peatland that is up to 2. 4 m deep in places, which is a valuable ecological resource that requires protection. Weirs have been built to restore the wetland function and prevent degradation by erosion, yet no monitoring had been conducted to determine the success of the restoration measures. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if rewetting of drained channelled valley bottom wetlands by weirs creates a back flooding effect, thereby raising the groundwater flow in the <b>wetland.</b> <b>Wetland</b> function was determined by means of hydrogeomorphological classification, soil profile analysis, and hydrodynamics. Hydrodynamics is a hypothetical field based method that requires the use of flow nets or models to determine flow dynamics in the system. Isotope analysis confirms the hydrological movement as illustrated by flow models, whereas flow duration curves represent the relationship between stream flow and adjacent sites. Peat accumulation commenced 2360 years BP during the mid-late Holocene period. LiDAR images indicated the lack of significant channelling taking place at the lowest point, therefore, clearly the Colbyn Valley was originally an unchannelled system. Although monitoring well water levels follow rainfall patterns, it was noted that in the first part of the study period that there was a delayed response to rainfall, most likely due to the high clay content of the soils, reducing permeability. The rain isotope signatures were different from the wells and piezometers, indicating that the main source for the system originated from the groundwater aquifer. During the wet season, isotope signatures indicated that the wetland and stream water were not related. The point at the peatland was the most depleted section, with groundwater being exposed to evaporation when reaching the surface. Enrichment of water during the wet season was indicative of base flow maintenance, an essential function of wetlands. The flow dynamics within the peat section could not be thoroughly examined but geological maps indicating a diabase dyke could account for the inconsistencies in flow dynamics. The repairs at weir 3 had a positive effect on water levels in adjacent sites, by raising the levels with more than 60 cm. When equating the water [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Small {{wetlands}} {{become increasingly}} important for agricultural production of rural households in sub-Saharan Africa. Changes in wetland systems are event driven and a cumulative result of individual farmer’s decisions of land uses. The overall objective of this dissertation {{was to develop a}} method that takes account of individual decision-making to study the current uses of wetlands by smallholder rural farmers and how wetlands may develop in the future. Diverse methods that include rapid rural and participative approaches, wetland mapping and classification, farm typologies, identification of drivers of land use change and farmers’ decision-making were used to develop a decision tree. This model was then used for scenario analyses. Case study wetlands were surveyed within a total area of 484 km 2. The wetlands were located in contrasting landscape units (lowland, midland, and highland) in Central Kenya and Laikipia plateau in Kenya and Usambara mountains and Pangani basin in northeastern Tanzania. Fifty-one (51) wetlands were characterised to identify and understand the drivers of diversity of wetlands and uses. Based on wetland type, shape, size, hydrological regime, soil fertility indicators, drainage patterns, use intensity, fertiliser, and market opportunity, wetland-units were categorised into five wetland cluster groups (WCGs). These groups were: 1. Largely unused narrow permanently flooded inland valleys; 2. Extensively used wide permanently flooded inland valleys and highland floodplains; 3. Seasonally flooded and moderately used wide inland valleys and lowland floodplains; 4. Completely drained and intensively used wide inland valleys and highland floodplains; and 5. narrow valleys drained for continuous high-value crops production. Case study farms from four WGCs (2 - 5) were characterised to identify the diversity of production systems and drivers of wetland use decisions by smallholder farmers in contrasting rural areas. Using a combination of production systems (livestock ownership, type, and its integration with crops), land resource (upland, wetland, and their combination), and production objectives (subsistence, cash, and cultural), households were grouped into 12 Farm Types. Based on these two typologies and their relationships with environmental and socio-economic drivers of wetland use, a decision tree model framework was developed to represent the diversity of farmers’ decision-making and analyse the effects of such diversity on current land uses in the wetlands. The framework was then used to explore changes in land use in scenario-driven analysis. Increasing land scarcity coupled with improved markets could increase the dependency of household’s livelihood on cropland in the wetland up to 100 % (e. g. for FT 2). This increase would also decrease pastoralism in semi-arid areas (87 %) as well as stimulate livestock integration by crop-based farms. Land use intensification across wetlands and specification in midland valleys could accompany such changes. Furthermore, land use displacement from traditional floodplain to rangeland grazing is an unavoidable consequence of land use intensification. Agricultural use of small wetlands offers opportunities to diversify rural livelihood systems. However, wetland farming is challenged by various hazards and shocks such as conflicts, abiotic, biotic, and socio-economic factors that constrain crop production. Small wetland agricultural systems are complex and characterised by interactions between heterogeneous human decision-makers (i. e. farmers) and their biophysical environment (wetland systems). Changes in these systems are event driven and cumulatively results from individual farmer’s decisions of land use in response to endogenous and exogenous drivers. Reconciling livelihood benefits with sustainable land use and natural resource conservation in rural areas is thus a complex and challenging social task that requires the development of an adaptive co-management process with the active participation of all stakeholders.   Key words : Farm(er) typologies, farmers’ decision-making, floodplain, households’ production systems, human-environment interactions, inland valley, Kenya, land use decisions, land use model, rural livelihood, scenario, simulation, Tanzania, uplands, <b>wetland,</b> <b>wetland</b> typology.  ...|$|E

40|$|I studied {{amphibians}} {{and their}} associated wetlands in the Missouri River floodplain in Iowa from 2010 - 2013. I {{had the opportunity}} to study the effect of a catastrophic flood on an anuran community in the Missouri River floodplain. Three species (plains leopard frog, Woodhouse 2 ̆ 7 s toad, and Blanchard 2 ̆ 7 s cricket frog) had only minor changes in adult male occupancy rate in the two years after the flood. Colonization rates for these species were positively associated with wetlands that were shallower near the shore and they {{did not appear to be}} affected by reduced vegetation. Three other species or species complexes (northern leopard frog, the gray treefrog complex, and boreal chorus frog) had greatly reduced occupancy rates in the two years after the flood. Colonization rates for these species were relatively low, and they had high extinction rates. Colonization rates for these species were not associated with any measured habitat characteristic. Future flood events will likely continue to make northern leopard frogs, gray treefrogs, and boreal chorus frogs a less important part of the ecological community. Although some species may fare well under extreme climate events forecast under climate change scenarios, I hypothesize that many species will be challenged. Amphibian conservation has often relied on auditory call surveys to determine habitat associations of anuran species. These surveys are restricted to only a single important life stage, however, and management recommendations from call surveys alone risk creating ecological traps or population sinks. Calling adult male surveys had established that slope at the inner edge of the <b>wetland,</b> <b>wetland</b> area, and percentage of bare ground within 1 m of the wetland were important habitat associations of calling adults of various species. I surveyed tadpoles and metamorphs of 5 anuran species and compared habitat associations for extinction rates of tadpoles and metamorphs with habitat associations for calling adults and found little overlap. I also estimated occupancy rates for calling adults, tadpoles, and metamorphs. Occupancy estimates indicate that reproductive success is variable, but the reasons are unknown. Occupancy rates of tadpoles and metamorphs were often lower than occupancy rates of adult calling males. Too often amphibian conservation and management proceeds with little information on critical aquatic life stages and I recommend greater emphasis on the entire life cycle to avoid potential misinformed conservation actions. The importance of isolated wetlands disconnected from the river in large river floodplains has largely been ignored and consequently there is little management supporting this important component of productivity and biodiversity. Isolated and fishless wetlands in the upper elevations of floodplains may support a community largely absent from the rest of the floodplain. Flow regulation has rendered the upper elevations of many floodplains nearly devoid of wetlands but restoration of large river floodplains places no emphasis on isolated wetlands, despite concern over their status elsewhere. Primary drivers of community composition in isolated wetlands are predatory fish and hydrology. Wetlands are likely colonized by fish, and I used a GIS model of the floodplain topography to estimate the connection stage (the river stage when a wetland floods), and fill stage (river stage corresponding to the minimum elevation of the wetland, which is an indication of hydroperiod) of isolated wetlands in my study site. I compared the characteristics of current isolated wetlands to historical hydrology to determine how often fishless isolated wetlands are present. Productivity and biodiversity of the floodplain could be increased greatly by increasing the number of wetlands with a connection stage corresponding to river stage of 8 - 9 m and a fill stage of 5 - 7 m. I recommend restoration of large river floodplains give due consideration to the entire gradient of wetland types that were present before flow regulation so that the full complement of biodiversity and productivity can be restored. I used a the multi-season occupancy model to estimate occupancy rates of successive life stages in Chapter 3, herein referred to as multiple life stage design. The constraints in a multi-stage analysis, namely, colonization rates of 0 and the successively decreasing occupancy rates for each life stage, require special considerations during the study design phase. I used simulations to explore the robustness of the parameter estimates when incorrectly assuming that colonization rate is 0. I explored the effect of design considerations such as the number of sites, detection probability, and number of surveys on confidence intervals of occupancy rates. Unacceptable bias in nearly all parameters is induced by true values of the colonization rate as low as 0. 05 when the colonization rate is fixed to 0. Confidence intervals for occupancy rates are most improved by increasing the number of sites, but also by increasing detection probability and increasing the number of surveys. Under a simulated scenario with 50 sites, confidence intervals overlapped if the difference between occupancy rates was approximately 0. 3 or less. Under excellent simulated study conditions with 200 sites, confidence intervals overlapped when the difference between occupancy rates was approximately 0. 15 or less. These results will aid researchers in making appropriate study design decisions to avoid bias and meet their objectives in researching life stages...|$|E
