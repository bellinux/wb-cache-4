25|$|Set {{off from}} Paris on Friday 21 June 1895 at 5.25am from the Porte Maillot, where Monsieur Haufert, {{timekeeper}} of the Union, {{gave us the}} starting signal, <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> the Bois de Boulogne towards Versailles. The weather was cold, that damp coldness of some mornings in June which makes you search for a light jacket and freezes your hands; but we were full of ardour, replete with good advice and lots of energy and it was happily that Richard and I on the tandem and our trainer Lambert on a bicycle started our long journey for the record from Paris to Agen.|$|E
25|$|Into the '60s, I {{was still}} not of a frame of mind {{that we were not}} only making music, we were making history. But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time. I recognized the bridges that <b>we</b> <b>crossed,</b> the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E
500|$|The first European land {{exploration}} of Alta California, the Spanish Portolá expedition, passed this way {{on its way}} north, camping at San Juan Creek on July 23, 1769. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi noted in his diary: [...] "...we came to a very pleasant green valley, full of willows, alders, live oaks, and other trees not known to us. It has a large arroyo, which {{at the point where}} <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> it carried a good stream of fresh and good water, which, after running a little way, formed in pools in some large patches of tules." [...] On the return journey to San Diego, the party used the campsite again, on January 20.|$|E

5000|$|A gentler variant {{popular in}} Britain is fishy fishy. The set {{up is the}} same as bulldog, with a group of runners {{on one side of the}} area and one or two {{catchers}} in the middle. The runners chant a phrase such as [...] "Fishy, Fishy, may <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> your golden water?" [...] or something similar. In The Midlands of England, the phrase [...] "Please Mrs Crocodile, can <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> the water in a cup and saucer, upside down?" [...] is more common; in America, children often chant [...] "Oh Captain, my Captain, may <b>we</b> <b>cross</b> your ship?" [...] instead.|$|R
500|$|Maruyama's {{left wing}} {{survivors}} {{were ordered to}} retreat back to the area west of the Matanikau River while Shoji's right wing was told to head for Koli Point, east of the Lunga perimeter. The left wing soldiers, who {{had run out of}} food several days before, began the retreat on 27 October. During the retreat, many of the Japanese wounded succumbed to their injuries and were buried along the Maruyama road. One of Maruyama's men, Lieutenant Keijiro Minegishi, noted in his diary, [...] "I never dreamed of retreating over the same mountainous trail through the jungle <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> with such enthusiasm... we haven't eaten in three days and even walking is difficult. On the up hill my body swayed around unable to walk. I must rest every two meters." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, {{following}} a long break, U2 contributed [...] "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me" [...] to the soundtrack {{album of the}} film Batman Forever. The song was a hit, reaching number one in Australia and Ireland, number two in the UK, and number 16 in the US. In November, the band released an experimental album called Original Soundtracks 1, a collaboration with Brian Eno, who contributed as a full songwriting and performing partner. Due to his participation and the record's highly experimental nature, the band chose to release it under the moniker [...] "Passengers" [...] to distinguish it from U2's conventional albums. Mullen said of the release: [...] "There's a thin line between interesting music and self-indulgence. <b>We</b> <b>crossed</b> it on the Passengers record." [...] It was commercially unnoticed by U2 standards and it received generally mixed reviews. However, the single [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] featuring Luciano Pavarotti was among Bono's favourite U2 songs.|$|E
500|$|When night {{began to}} fall, we climbed into our boats and floated down the Danube and crossed {{over to the}} other side several miles below the place where Vlad's army was stationed. There we dug {{ourselves}} trenches, so that cavalry could not harm us. After that <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> back {{over to the other}} side and transported other janissaries over the Danube, and when the entire infantry had crossed over, then we prepared and set out gradually against Vlad's army, together with the artillery and other equipment that we had brought with us. Having halted, we set up the cannon, but not in time to stop three hundred janissaries from being killed ... Seeing that our side was greatly weakening, we defended ourselves with the 120 guns which we had brought over and fired so often that we repelled the prince's army and greatly strengthened our position ... Vlad, seeing that he could not prevent the crossing, withdrew. After that the emperor crossed the Danube with his entire army and gave us 30,000 coins to be distributed among us.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{the other}} two plays {{that made up the}} trilogy that {{included}} Seven Against Thebes, Laius and Oedipus, and of its satyr play The Sphinx, few fragments have survived. [...] The only fragment definitively assigned to Oedipus is a line translated by Herbert Weir Smyth as [...] "We were coming on our journey to the place from which three highways part in the branching roads, where <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> the junction of the triple roads at Potniae." [...] The only two fragments definitively assigned to The Sphinx were translated by Smyth as [...] "For the stranger a garland, an ancient crown, the best of bonds, as Prometheus said," [...] and [...] "The Sphinx, the Watch-dog that presideth over evil days." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 16, {{two days}} after the first ascent and the catastrophe, Jean-Antoine Carrel set out to crown Whymper's victory by proving that the Italian side was not unconquerable. He was {{accompanied}} by Amé Gorret, a priest who had shared with him the first attempt on the mountain back in 1857. Jean-Baptiste Bich and Jean-Augustin Meynet completed the party. Giordano would have joined them, but Carrel refused absolutely to take him with them; he said he would not have the strength to guide a traveller, and could neither answer for the result nor for any one's life. After hearing Sunday mass at the chapel of Breuil, the party started. Amé Gorret has described this ascent with enthusiasm: [...] "At last <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> the Col du Lion and set foot upon the pyramid of the Matterhorn!" [...] On the following day, the 17th, they continued the ascent and reached Tyndall's flagstaff. [...] "We were about to enter unknown country," [...] wrote Gorret, [...] "for no man had gone beyond this point." [...] Here opinions were divided; Gorret suggested ascending by the ridge and scaling the last tower straight up. Carrel was inclined to traverse {{to the west of the}} peak, and thence go up on the Zmutt side. Naturally the wish of Carrel prevailed, for he was the leader and had not lost the habit of command, notwithstanding his recent defeat.|$|E
2500|$|Posing as {{a married}} couple, Argüello and Khaled boarded the plane using Honduran passports—having {{passed through a}} {{security}} check of their luggage—and were seated in the second row of tourist class. Once the plane was approaching the British coast, they drew their guns and grenades and approached the cockpit, demanding entrance. According to Khaled, {{in an interview in}} 2000,"So half an hour (after take off) we had to move. We stood up. I had my two hand grenades and I showed everybody I was taking the pins out with my teeth. Patrick stood up. We heard shooting just the same minute and when <b>we</b> <b>crossed</b> the first class, people were shouting but I didn't see who was shooting because it was behind us. So Patrick told me 'go forward I protect your back.' So I went and then he found a hostess {{and she was going to}} catch me round the legs. So I rushed, reached to the cockpit, it was closed. [...] So I was screaming 'open the door.' Then the hostess came; she said 'she has two hand grenades,' but they did not open (the cockpit door) and suddenly I was threatening to blow up the plane. I was saying 'I will count and if you don't open I will blow up the plane.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|So we flew along all day. At 2 P.M. {{the belt}} of timber that fringes the North Platte and marks its {{windings}} through the vast level {{floor of the}} Plains came in sight.
