2500|$|According to Lise <b>Waxer,</b> [...] "African salsa points {{not so much}} to {{a return}} of salsa to African soil (Steward 1999: 157) but to a complex process of {{cultural}} appropriation between two regions of the so-called Third World." [...] Since the mid-1990s African artists have also been very active through the super-group Africando, where African and New York musicians mix with leading African singers such as Bambino Diabate, Ricardo Lemvo, Ismael Lo and Salif Keita. It is still common today for an African artist to record a salsa tune, and add their own particular regional touch to it.|$|E

50|$|A <b>wax</b> {{emulsion}} is {{a stable}} mixture {{of one or}} more <b>waxes</b> in water. <b>Waxes</b> and water are normally immiscible but can be brought together stably by the use of surfactants and a clever preparation process. Strictly speaking a <b>wax</b> emulsion should be called a <b>wax</b> dispersion since the <b>wax</b> is solid at room temperature. However, because the preparation takes place above the melting point of the <b>wax,</b> the actual process is called emulsification, hence the name <b>wax</b> emulsion.

40|$|On this {{research}} has been done the optimization of the batik <b>wax</b> waste utilization through batik <b>wax</b> making with blending method using bees <b>wax,</b> gum rosin, paraffin and lard. This research has been expected to be able to reduce the water pollution along with the decline in the quantity of batik solid waste which has been discharged into water bodies. However, research needs to be done regarding the quality of batik product resulting from a production process using <b>wax</b> which involves the use of batik <b>wax</b> waste. The batik product quality is determined by latched power, and the resistance of the <b>wax</b> against cracking and alkaline chemicals of batik <b>wax</b> product which has been used. The latched power test results from four groups of batik <b>wax</b> product showed the area with minimum latched power on temperature range of 50 - 70 ˚C for batik <b>wax</b> which have been made from blending of bees <b>wax,</b> <b>wax</b> waste, and gum rosin, 50 - 80 ˚C for batik <b>wax</b> which have been made from blending of bees <b>wax,</b> <b>wax</b> waste, and paraffin;  50 - 90 ˚C for batik <b>wax</b> which have been made from blending of bees <b>wax,</b> gum rosin and lard. Compared with <b>wax</b> product which have been made from blend of bees <b>wax,</b> <b>wax</b> waste and gum rosin as well as with paraffin, the batik <b>wax</b> product which have been made from the blend of bees <b>wax,</b> gum rosin and lard have lower resistance to cracking that has been observed from the occurance of yellow color on the fabric sample resulted from the dyeing process using yellow naphtol. The different result has been obtained from resistance test of the <b>wax</b> product against alkaline chemicals which showed that all kind of batik <b>wax</b> product resulted on {{this research}} have a good resistance against alkaline chemicals which has been observed from the absence of <b>wax</b> mass reduction of the fabric samples before and after treatment in the alkaline chemicals...|$|R

30|$|<b>Wax</b> {{deposits}} on {{the wall}} of a crude oil pipeline are a solid <b>wax</b> network of fine crystals, filled with oil, resin, asphaltene and other impurities. In this paper, a series of experiments on <b>wax</b> deposition in a laboratory flow loop were performed under different conditions (flow rate, temperature differential between crude oil and pipeline wall, and dissolved <b>wax</b> concentration gradient), and the <b>wax</b> deposits were analyzed, so quantitative relationships among <b>wax</b> content, <b>wax</b> appearance temperature (WAT), shear stress, and radial concentration gradient of dissolved <b>wax</b> at the solid/liquid interface were obtained.

50|$|Stripless <b>wax</b> (as {{opposed to}} strip <b>wax),</b> also {{referred}} to as hard <b>wax,</b> is applied somewhat thickly and with no cloth or paper strips.

Stripless <b>wax</b> does not adhere to the skin as much as strip <b>wax</b> does, thus making it a good option for sensitive skin as finer hairs are more easily removed because the hard <b>wax</b> encapsulates the hair as it hardens. The stripless <b>waxing</b> method can also be less painful.|$|R

5000|$|Horatio Vallejo (voiced by Horatio Sanz): The Mexican-American junior {{commissioner}} of the Safety Patrol and Fillmore's immediate superior. Vallejo has had some rough experiences in the Safety Patrol as an officer: Losing his friend and fellow safety partol officer Malika to the Red Robins, a crooked girl scout troop after she went undercover and went bad leaving the force. And unintentionally betraying his partner and friend, Frank Bishop, after he refused {{to speak out against}} his expulsion from the force, believing it would jeopardize his chances of becoming Commissioner. Vallejo has problems with drinking too much cocoa, which is a kid-friendly version of problems with excessive caffeine or alcohol. Vallejo is often put at odds against Fillmore, such as when he is forced to take Fillmore off a case even though he doesn't want to, or Fillmore is close to solving it. He also often scolds Fillmore for his reckless destruction of school property, which usually allows Fillmore to catch the criminal, but makes both him and the safety patrol look bad. The only thing that gets Vallejo more mad is when he sees how much it's going to cost to repair the damages, caused by Fillmore. Vallejo's catchphrase is yelling [...] "FILLMORE!", which he does in almost every episode when he hears of something Fillmore broke, like a <b>waxer,</b> and ordering expensive walkie talkies by tricking him into signing his signature. Another running gag is that his first name is either unknown or covered up throughout the series.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first game}} {{developed}} by Oddworld Inhabitants is 1997's Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee. Published by GT Interactive for PlayStation, DOS and Windows platforms, {{it is the}} first in their planned five-game Quintology of games set on the fictional planet of Oddworld. The game tells the story of Abe, a happy, ignorant factory worker and the destined savior of his mudokon race. Abe is a lowly floor <b>waxer</b> at RuptureFarms, a meat processing plant run by the evil glukkons on Oddworld's largest continent of Mudos. The plant makes sweet and savory treats by farming and slaughtering the wildlife that roam the rural areas surrounding the plant, and exploits 100 mudokons for slave labor to run their factory. When Abe discovers the glukkons' plan to increase their dwindling profits by using the mudokons in their new tasty treat, he vows to escape the plant and save his 99 friends. Along the way, he meets a spiritual guide that opens his mind to the mudokons' bond with nature and Abe's personal destiny to awaken the powerful mudokon gods and become the prophesied savior who would return his race to their sacred holy lands. The game is a side-scrolling 2D platformer with lifelike animation on top of photo-realistic backgrounds. Its revolutionary features included the ability to [...] "chant" [...] in order to possess and remotely control the bodies of Slig guards to solve puzzles or allow Abe to advance safely; and a feature called gamespeak, the ability for the player to engage in conversation with other mudokons to navigate them to safety. The game was later ported to Gameboy by Saffire under the title Oddworld Adventures.|$|E
40|$|A {{large part}} of worlds {{remaining}} oil and gas resources is found in harsh environments such as deep water and arctic conditions. The development of such oil and gas fields requires advanced process and transport solutions. <b>Wax</b> is precipitated out of solution as reservoir fluid cools down during transport. <b>Wax</b> precipitation may cause operational problems when unprocessed well streams are transported in undersea pipelines. The goal of this work is to investigate modelling concept for controlled <b>wax</b> deposition and controlled <b>wax</b> loosening that is applicable to subsea flowlines in {{oil and gas production}} systems. An approach to <b>wax</b> control using the annulus pipe in pipe flow concept is modelled and also described. <b>Wax</b> thermodynamic and deposition models is reviewed and evaluated. The review is aimed to provide accurate prediction analysis of <b>wax</b> precipitation and to serve as a reliable knowledge input into <b>wax</b> deposition modelling in oil and gas flow systems. The cold flow concept for <b>wax</b> deposition solution is developed using an annulus pipe in pipe configuration for the cooling of oil below the <b>wax</b> appearance temperature. A <b>wax</b> deposition zone is created, an effect of a large temperature gradient, which is the driving force between cooling water and the flowing oil in the annulus cooling section of the pipeline. Co-current and counter current oil cooling cases is tested. The counter current annulus-cooling case is validated to adequately knock out potential <b>wax</b> from the oil in the <b>wax</b> deposition zone. The annulus cooling approach is considered to provide an efficient and economic <b>wax</b> control strategy for the mechanical removal of <b>wax</b> in a <b>wax</b> control zone when pigging of <b>wax</b> is to be employed in a flowline eliminating excessively long pigging routes and high cost of pigging operation in typical subsea pipelines. A wax-loosening model is further developed to determine potential loosening and potential transport tendencies of stable <b>wax</b> solids liberated from the wall flowline downstream the annulus. Experimental results from the Porsgrunn flow loop of Statoil AS reveals that stable <b>wax</b> solid is released from <b>wax</b> deposits on pipeline walls when the inner wall is heated {{for a short period of}} time such that released stable <b>wax</b> is transported in the cool stream with no or low tendency of re-deposition downstream the flowline. Deposited <b>wax</b> in the <b>wax</b> deposition zone is liberated using hot water sent through the annulus. Model results show re-deposition downstream the flowline. Ability of this <b>wax</b> deposition module to predict <b>wax</b> loosening is criticised. OLGA shows good representation of <b>wax</b> deposition growth in the annulus but incapable to represent expected <b>wax</b> liberation in the flowline at temperatures higher than the <b>wax</b> appearance temperature but below the dissolution temperature. A cold flow <b>wax</b> liberation model using active fluid forces with minimum wall heating for effective stripping of <b>wax</b> from the <b>wax</b> deposition zone is proposed. </p...|$|R
