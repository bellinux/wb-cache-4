500|$|After the Dubai World Cup, California Chrome {{was shipped}} to Rae Guest's Newmarket stables in England {{to prepare for}} Royal Ascot week in June. The {{decision}} to go to England was made by Perry Martin, against the wishes of both Coburn and Sherman. Martin explained, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> in terms of what's best for the horse. It was my decision to send him to Newmarket. It's a beautiful place, with trees and pastures for gallops...It's good for his mind. I know Art didn't take the decision well. But he'll be okay." [...] The horse's exercise rider in England, Robbie Mills, who was acquainted with the Shermans and advised them to stable the horse with Guest, stated that California Chrome was making a good transition from the flat dirt tracks of the United States to the undulating turf gallops of England. The horse was pointed to the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot, with European jockey William Buick, who rode Prince Bishop in Dubai, tapped to ride. The day before the race, the horse was scratched because of a bruised hoof that was draining pus. Guest stated, [...] "He's been X-rayed and there's no damage." [...] Martin wanted to run him in Chicago's Arlington Million in August, and the requirements of quarantine upon his return to the United States combined with the setback to his training foreclosed any other UK start. [...] Upon California Chrome's return to the US in early July, a veterinary radiograph revealed that he had bruising on his cannon bones that would require at least three months to heal, effectively ending his four-year-old season. The veterinarians at Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital in Kentucky explained, [...] "California Chrome's x-rays showed all of his joints to be remarkably clean. He has the early signs of bruising {{to the bottom of the}} cannon bones...The return rate for horses with this problem is very high...we found that recovery rate was 95% after giving time in the paddock to heal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Children {{released}} their 22nd single [...] on January 1, 2002, {{which was}} used as a show song in the Japanese drama [...] Four months later their tenth original album It's a Wonderful World was released on May 10, the groups' tenth anniversary. The release of the album on their 10th anniversary was not something that had originally intended. As the group was wrapping up recording, Sakurai asked if the album could be released in the spring time. While the group and their management <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of how to promote an album in the spring time, they came up with releasing the album on their 10th anniversary. A new tour, titled Mr. Children Tour 2002 Dear Wonderful World was set to begin later that year. The previous single [...] "I'll Be" [...] from the Discovery album was selected to be used as an official theme for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, held in Japan and South Korea. On May 24, 2002 Mr. Children attended the first ever MTV Video Music Awards Japan and topped the awards show by winning 'Video of the year' for the song [...] "Kimi ga suki". Two months after the release of the new album, Mr.Children's 23rd single [...] "Any", was released on July 11, 2002 and used to promote [...] Group 10th Anniversary. The group was not able to properly promote the single. As preparations for the new tour were beginning and promotion for the new single were being done, lead singer Sakurai was hospitalized on July 21, 2002, after a blockage in his cerebellum was detected. The Mr. Children Tour 2002 Dear Wonderful World was canceled and all group activities were put on a temporary hiatus. While recovering, Sakurai wrote a song called [...] "Hero", that was inspired by his hospitalization. The song was released as the group's 24th single on December 11, 2002 and was used in [...] Group 10th Anniversary commercial. The first press version of the single included a DVD where, in addition to a Mr. Children 2002 documentary -Hero- that was aired, the singer talked about his hospitalization and inspiration for the song. On November 15, 2002 Mr.Children's website announced the band's return to the stage for a [...] "stew of home pride" [...] with a one night only live, [...] December 21, 2002 the group returned to the stage for a single concert, later released on DVD, titled Wonederful World on Dec. 21.|$|E
