The ruling states Dickinson's lawyers can only seek answers {{as to whether the}} denials were made maliciously, and Cosby and Singer can assert attorney-client privilege and refuse to answer some questions. Singer was scheduled to be deposed November 19 in Los Angeles, with Cosby's deposition occurring on November 23 in Boston. On November 12, a California appeals court temporarily halted an order requiring them to testify.

According to the "new growth theory", investments in knowledge and human capital generate economic growth via spillovers of knowledge. But the theory does not explain how <b>or</b> <b>why</b> spillovers occur, <b>or</b> <b>why</b> large investments in R+D do not always result in economic growth. What is missing is "the knowledge filter" - the distinction between general knowledge and economically useful knowledge. Also missing is a mechanism (such as entrepreneurship) converting economically relevant knowledge into economic activity. This paper shows that the unprecedented increase in R+D spending in the United States during and after World War II was converted into economic activity via incumbent firms in the early postwar period and increasingly via new ventures in the last few decades. knowledge, economic growth, entrepreneurship, spillovers, history...|$|R

How exact are economic theories and can they lay claim to the status of an exact science - for example, are economic predictions as reliable as predictions in the natural sciences, and <b>why</b> <b>or</b> <b>why</b> not?

40|$|Sentences {{that begin}} with Why don’t you （I, we） <b>or</b> <b>Why</b> not are {{primarily}} interrogatives, and they normally take question marks. A {{large number of}} these instances are used with question marks, {{but some of them}} are not. The instances with question marks can imply suggestions, offers or requests as well as doubt or interrogative meanings. The instances without question marks can also imply suggestions, offers or requests. The expressions similar to <b>Why</b> don’t you <b>or</b> <b>why</b> not include How （What）about, Can I, Can（ Could） you, Can’t（ Couldn’t） you, Will（ Would） you, Won’t（ Wouldn’t） you and Will （Would） … please. The objective {{of this article is to}} explore how and why these expressions are sometimes used without question marks. The instances were largely taken from the corpora in the BNC and Wordbanks.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between an economy's financial {{sector and the}} occurrence and resolution of conflict may at first sight appear tenuous. Banking systems, financial regulation and currency arrangements {{do not appear to}} be relevant in understanding <b>why</b> nations collapse <b>or</b> <b>why</b> people kill each other. However, the linkages between the financial sector and issues of conflict are closer than one might expect. Narrow development—development that fails to reduce poverty and which exacerbates initial inequalities—is an important cause of conflict (but, needless to say, not the only one). Narrow development must be financed—and it is financed in ways that increase poverty and inequality and raise a society's propensity to violent conflict. During conflict, finance (both internal and external) can be decisive in determining who wins, as well as the duration of war. …/...|$|R

The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about $1,000 which is half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said: “No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from it.” So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's laboratory to steal the drug for his wife.
