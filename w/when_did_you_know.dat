If <b>you</b> <b>know</b> in advance how many days you will go skiing, you can decide your minimum cost. For example, if you will be skiing for more than 10 days it will be cheaper to buy skis, while if you will be skiing for fewer than 10 days it will be cheaper to rent.

500|$|... "Walk Away" [...] is a piano-driven waltz ballad. Written {{in the key}} of G major, it is a downtempo song, with a {{moderate}} slow and bluesy tempo of 52 beats per minute. It {{is followed by a}} chord progression of EmC7 in the verses. Aguilera's vocal range on the song span nearly two octaves, from the low-note of C3 to the high-note of G5. In the track, Aguilera uses a [...] "sultry lower range". Lyrically, [...] "Walk Away" [...] is about an abusive relationship, where she uses a [...] "clever" [...] metaphor. At the song's beginning, the lyrics [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> something's bad for you, and you still can't let go?" [...] are spoken by Aguilera. In the first verse, she sings, [...] "Your love was like candy/ Artificially sweet, I was deceived by your wrapping".
