5|$|After Robinson's death, Gravetye Manor <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> the Forestry Commission, {{who left}} it {{derelict}} for many years. In 1958 it was leased to a restaurateur who refurbished the gardens, replacing {{some of the}} flower beds with lawn. Today, Gravetye Manor serves as a hotel and restaurant.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1980 eruption, {{the area}} <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> {{gradually}} {{return to its}} natural state. In 1987, the U.S. Forest Service reopened the mountain to climbing. It remained open until 2004 when renewed activity caused {{the closure of the}} area around the mountain (see Geological history section above for more details).|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the dry ski slope near Park Road and the Uxbridge Lido {{was closed}} and the {{remaining}} buildings and structures removed. The Hillingdon Ski Centre had been subject to several arson attacks during 2001 and the company operating it became insolvent. The slope, which had been built in 1977, <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> return to nature.|$|E

5|$|Rosenberg left a will {{in which}} he {{requested}} that his body be cremated using quicklime. Most of his estate <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> his children; the will stated that his Torah and yad were {{to be given to}} his son Adolph, but this was not done as they remained in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The VOC {{authorities}} salvaged as much {{as possible}} from the beached Meermin. They recovered nearly 300 firearms, gunpowder and musket balls, compasses and five bayonets; they auctioned cables, ropes and other items from the ship on the shore. Meermin <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> break up where she grounded.|$|E

5|$|After {{the battle}} of Quetzaltepeque, Villa Real was still short on food and Mazariegos was ill. He sent his brother to the capital of New Spain to ask for help, and then retreated to Copanaguastla against the protests of the town council, which <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> defend the fledgling colony. By now, Nuño de Guzmán was {{governor}} in Mexico, and he despatched Juan Enríquez de Guzmán to Chiapa as end-of-term judge over Mazariegos, and as alcalde mayor (a local colonial governor). He occupied his post for a year, during which time he attempted to reestablish Spanish control over the province, especially the northern and eastern regions, {{but was unable to}} make much headway.|$|E

50|$|In 1858 {{the company}} was again resolved, and its network was divided among {{companies}} in private property.

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Kingdom of Bosnia into the Ottoman hands in 1463, the {{southern}} and central parts of the Kingdom of Croatia remained unprotected, the defense of which <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> Croatian gentry who kept smaller troops in the fortified border areas at their own expense. Decisive Ottoman victory at the Battle of Krbava field in 1493, shook all of Croatia. However, it did not dissuade the Croats from making more decisive and persistent attempts at defending themselves against the attacks of the much larger enemy. A new wave of Ottoman conquest began in 1521, after which a good portion of Croatia was conquered or pillaged.|$|E
5|$|Allcroft's {{descendants}} {{fell into}} financial difficulties {{during the early}} 20th century, however, and it became increasingly {{difficult for them to}} cover the costs of maintaining Stokesay. In 1986 Jewell Magnus-Allcroft finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of English Heritage, and the castle <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> the organisation on her death in 1992. English Heritage carried out extensive restoration of the castle in the late 1980s. In the 21st century, Stokesay Castle continues to be operated as a tourist attraction, receiving 39,218 visitors in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Although {{credited}} {{with the development of}} the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> Thomas Johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters. Two strains were developed: the rough- and smooth-coated varieties. The rough-coated beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably been absorbed into the standard beagle bloodline.|$|E

5|$|As a result, in {{an attempt}} to avoid a naval {{conflict}} with the superior British Royal Navy, Portugal adjusted the borders of her colony and the modern borders of Mozambique were established in May 1881. Control of Mozambique <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> various organisations such as the Mozambique Company, the Zambezi Company and the Niassa Company which were financed and provided with cheap labour by the British Empire to work mines and construct railways. These companies penetrated inland from the coastline, setting up plantations and taxing the local populace who had until then resisted encroachment by the colonists.|$|E
5|$|Assiniboine {{returned}} to Canada in June and was briefly {{used as a}} troop transport before a boiler room fire on 4 July effectively ended her career. She was paid off on 8 August and placed on the disposal list. Whilst on tow to the breakers in Baltimore, she ran aground near East Point, Prince Edward Island. Attempts to get her off failed, and she <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> rust until eventually being broken up in place in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Both Foudroyant and Lion {{were too}} {{battered}} {{to provide an}} effective tow to the dismasted French ship, {{and as a result}} Penelope <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> bring the shattered Guillaume Tell into Syracuse on Sicily. Eventually the ship was repaired sufficiently for the journey to Britain, and there was added to the Royal Navy under the name HMS Malta. Malta was, with HMS Tonnant captured two years earlier at the Nile, the most powerful third rate in the British fleet, and served for many years, participating at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1805.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{receiving}} considerable {{numbers of}} visitors - over 16,000 in 1955 - {{it was becoming}} increasingly impractical to maintain the castle, and calls were made for the State {{to take over the}} property. For several decades the owners, Philip and Jewell Magnus-Allcroft, declined these proposals and continued to run the castle privately. In 1986 Jewell finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of English Heritage, and the castle <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> the organisation on her death in 1992.|$|E
