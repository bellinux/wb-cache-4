500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Rod Hardy, making it his first credit for the series. Hardy was offered the role after an unknown individual working at The X-Files saw his TBS remake of the film High Noon. The parasitic creature {{that was used in}} the episode was created using animatronics and was designed to look like a banana slug. During the scene where the creature is inserted into Scully's back, the production crew created a false fiberglass back for Gillian Anderson. To create the illusion that the creature <b>was</b> <b>crawling</b> up the body, the fiberglass was placed on top of Anderson, and then the animatronic slug was pressed against the fake back. Anderson later described the scene as [...] "fun to shoot", although she also called it [...] "exhausting" [...] because she had to struggle on the bed, all the while tied down, with her arms being attached to the headboard and her legs to the footboard. Paul Rabwin later noted that he had several cameramen [...] "start to lose it" [...] during the scene.|$|E

The posse surrounded the whole ranch, building pits {{on the ground for}} cover and killing the Invaders' horses to prevent them from escaping. Twenty of the gunmen tried to escape behind a fusillade, but the posse beat them back and killed three to five. Another Texas gunman accidentally shot himself mortally in the groin as he <b>was</b> <b>crawling</b> to safety from the barrage of bullets being fired by the settlers. As the siege dragged on, a settler rode off to Fort McKinney requesting to borrow a cannon but was turned down. A blacksmith named Rap Brown tried to build his own cannon but it exploded when he first tested it. Nonetheless, he built the [...] "Ark of Safety", a large bullet-resistant wagon that would help the settlers get close to the ranch so they could throw dynamite at the Invaders.|$|E

500|$|Although Lipsett {{was unhappy}} about the transfer, he acquiesced and took {{energetic}} {{command of the}} division during the Hundred Days Offensive. On 14 October 1918, whilst planning an assault at Saulzoir in France he <b>was</b> <b>crawling</b> along a bank overlooking the River Selle with several officers of his own staff {{and some of the}} 49th Division, when at about 3:15 in the afternoon the party was spotted and a German machine gun opened fire from across the river. The party went to ground but a single bullet struck Lipsett in the face. He was able to stagger back to his own lines but there collapsed from massive blood loss and never regained consciousness. He was the last British general to be killed during the First World War. Lipsett was buried the following day in Quéant Communal Cemetery at a funeral attended by dozens of officers from the British and Canadian armies in France. The burial party was provided by the 8th Battalion, C.E.F. and amongst the mourners was the Prince of Wales. After the war [...] he was posthumously awarded the Croix d'officier de la Legion d'honneur and the Croix de Guerre by the French government.|$|E

On 12 May 1901, {{he was part of}} a {{reconnaissance}} squad patrolling in the location of the Toorberg Mountain above the Doornbosch Farm when they came across and engaged a group of Boers. In the ensuing battle, Moore's horse was shot out from underneath him, and he took cover behind the body of the fallen horse. He was then seriously wounded when a Boer bullet hit him in the waist, having passed through the body of the dead horse. Moore eventually killed his Boer opponent after eight shots, and had struggled back to a ridge and <b>was</b> <b>crawling</b> along it {{on his hands and knees}} when his mates found him. They took the gravely wounded Moore to the nearby Kwaggashoek Farmhouse. He died of his wounds that night; a contemporary South Melbourne newspaper claimed that Moore [...] "was the first man of the Imperial Contingent to die of gunshot wounds".|$|E

2500|$|Leaving {{his wife}} and son, Clark began {{the first of his}} diaries a month before the First Fleet {{departed}} Portsmouth, on 13 May 1787. The writing in the diaries is very personal and informal, and was never intended for publication. Clark was extremely homesick, and longed to see {{his wife and}} son, writing as early as {{the second day of the}} voyage: [...] "Oh my God all my hoppes [...] are over of seeing my beloved wife and son". Like many of his fellow officers, he was aggrieved at the level of comfort and support offered to the convicts, noting [...] "I believe few Marines or Soldiers going out on a foreign Service under Government were ever better, if so well provided for as these Convicts are". On arrival in Botany Bay, Clark was dismayed at the unsuitable conditions, which were far from what had been promised in England: [...] "if we are obliged to settle here there will not a soul be alive in the course of a year". With the site for settlement subsequently moved to Sydney Cove, Clark remained distressed by the living conditions experienced by himself and his fellow officers, expressing in a letter to his family in England: [...] "I never slept worse, my dear wife, than I did last night, what with the hard cold ground, spiders, ants and every vermin you can think of <b>was</b> <b>crawling</b> over me". During the colony's early years, little food was produced, and the rations brought from England were soon consumed, leaving the colony in near starvation. Clark wrote [...] "God help us. If some ships dont [...] arrive, I dont know what will". Supplies finally arrived in June 1790, on Lady Juliana.|$|E
