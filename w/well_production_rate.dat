40|$|AbstractDue {{to extreme}} poison, strong corrosion, and complex {{precipitation}} and deposition of H 2 S in the reservoir, {{it is very}} difficult and risky to investigate and explore drilling, completion, production and gas transportation. In the course of production of fractured gas reservoir with high H 2 S content, formation pressure falls continually, which lead to decline of solubility of sulfur particles in gas phase. Sulfur particles which dissolve in gas phase originally in the formation should precipitate from gas phase after running up to saturation state and deposit at pore space and throat, sequentially resulting in formation porosity and permeability reduction. At present, the researches of sulfur deposition are mainly focused on the conventional gas reservoirs and sulfur deposition in the near wellbore region is generally estimated using Roberts' model. However, most of the gas reservoirs with high-content H 2 S are fractured gas reservoirs, classical damage model is no longer applicable to fractured gas reservoirs with high H 2 S content. In the present study, a sulfur deposition damage model is established. The refined model, based on non-Darcy flow, takes into consideration the effects of sulfur deposition, variation in gas properties and fracture. In addition, the effect of gas <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> on formation permeability is also studied. The results show that formation permeability decreases with fracture aperture and gas <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> increasing. The bigger gas <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> is, the quicker sulfur precipitates. The sulfur deposition of fractured gas reservoir with high-content H 2 S is mainly in the near wellbore zone, and the fracture aperture has {{a significant impact on the}} formation permeability in the near wellbore zone...|$|E

According to Fig.  5 a, a substantial difference exists between estimated flow rate of single-layer and real 28 -layer reservoir model in almost all bottom-hole pressures. However, 4 -layer model is in good agreement with results of 28 -layer model, as shown in Fig.  5 b. For a closer examination, the relative errors of estimated production rate of single-layer and 4 -layer reservoir model with respect to results of 28 -layer model are provided in Table  8. As seen, single-layer model has a relatively high error in <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate.</b> Also, this error increases with decreasing average reservoir pressure. The reported relative errors for 4 -layer reservoir model confirm the observed results of Fig.  5 b. Equation (4) was used for calculation of relative error with the difference that Q_i^est is estimated production rate of 1 - or 4 -layer model. Q_i^act [...] is <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> in 28 -layer model. Therefore, oversimplification of a multilayer reservoir into a single layer leads to a non-realistic IPR model which may result in an operating point different from that observed in a gas well.|$|E

However, if liquid loading can be predicted accurately and on time a suitable solution can be put together to combat it. This prediction in question is the primary aim of this study and research, {{due to the fact that}} the predicting methods at various points and times show various discrepancies, coming up or developing a better prediction mechanism will go a long way in saving maybe hundreds of petroleum gas wells which would have shut down prematurely due to liquid loading.|$|E

30|$|Although {{the field}} started {{production}} in 1911, {{there is no}} record of individual <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rates</b> (yearly, monthly or daily) before 1939. Only cumulative oil <b>production</b> for each <b>well</b> has been recorded.|$|R
50|$|Oil {{production}} {{started in}} May 1976, with average initial rate of 100 STB/day for most <b>wells.</b> <b>Production</b> <b>rates</b> gradually dropped to 15-20 STB/day within 2 {{years with a}} small watercut. At the end of December 1986 the cumulative oil production was 689,546 STB.|$|R
30|$|In {{the next}} scenarios, {{we have tried}} to drill four new wells within the {{reservoir}} top area and also to change gas recovery rate from each well to obtain the best reservoir depletion plan. In scenario 2, the minimum production rate has been set. The obtained results of this case indicate a slight pressure drop even a very long time after starting the production (ultimate reservoir life, i.e., 21, 000  days), so that the injection operation should be triggered at a very high pressure which makes the operation economically nonviable even if an adequate set of compressors is available to generate such a pressure. This {{can be attributed to the}} reservoir aquifer and suggest a partial aquifer which depends on the production rate from the reservoir. Such an aquifer may only serve to compensate hydrocarbon depletion-derived pressure drop at lower production rates and will lose its effectiveness at higher production rates. Contributions of the number of wells are considered in scenarios 3 and 4. In scenario 3, the reservoir has produced via eight producing wells, whereas in scenario 4, keeping the maximum production to be that in scenario 3, two more producing wells have been drilled causing a reduction in per <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate.</b> As mentioned before, as per well pressure drop is reduced, reservoir’s mean pressure drop is decreased also leading less number of condensates to liquefy in the reservoir environment. Hence, cumulative condensate production enjoys a significant increase. Also, a longer period would pass before a given drop in the production rate occurs, while cumulative gas production is also boosted. Evaluating different scenarios and their results, scenario five was developed in such a way to obtain the best results. In this scenario, in addition, to producing maximum amount of gas and gas condensate, an acceptable per <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> was achieved.|$|E
30|$|Considering {{different}} values for skin factor, corresponding drainage radius {{was calculated by}} Eq. (9) to determine operating point, and results are shown in Table  17 as group (A) According to these results, for skin factor less than 10, the corresponding drainage radius is very large and unreasonable. On the other hand, for skin factor above 15, corresponding drainage radius will be very short. By assuming logical values for drainage radius, corresponding skin factor was computed using Eq. (9) and summarized in Table  17 as group (B) Results of this table show that for drainage radius range of 3000 – 20, 000 ft, the skin factor is variable between 11 and 12.9, quite high for the investigated gas condensate well. So, the problem of low <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> {{can be attributed to}} this high skin factor.|$|E

This paper presents a simplified mathematical model of a crack partially filled with compressible proppant subject to remote compressive stress and a computational approach for evaluating the productivity rate of hydraulically stimulated wells. The conducted case studies confirm that the proppant pack distribution and compressibility {{have a significant impact}} on well productivity. Furthermore, it is suggested that under certain conditions, for example, relatively low confining stresses, the partially propped fractures can lead to higher <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> than fractures fully filled with proppant.

30|$|For both {{vertical}} {{wells and}} vertical fractured <b>wells,</b> the <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> of anisotropic formation {{will be less}} than formation with isotropic permeability.|$|R
30|$|To better {{explain the}} reason for these observations, average {{pressure}} distribution of reservoir layers with depth of 1 -, 4 - and 28 -layer model in average reservoir pressure of 4650 psi and bottom-hole pressure of 900 psi were plotted and compared simultaneously. These results are demonstrated in Fig.  6, which indicates that the average pressure in layers of single-layer and 28 -layer models are far from each other. The lack of exchanging flow between reservoir layers because of existence of almost non-permeable layers (5, 9 and 18), leads a discontinuity in pressure distribution of 28 -layer model (Fig.  6). Therefore, the behavior of actual 28 -layer model is not close to the single-layer one. In opposite, if the vertical permeability is high in a multi-layered heterogeneous reservoir, exchange of flow occurs between layers and pressure of layers approaches equilibrium. In such situation, the behavior of multi-layered reservoir will be close to a single-layer and homogeneous reservoir. In this study, different pressure distributions caused a significant discrepancy between predicted <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rates</b> and IPR curves of single-layer and 28 -layer model. As seen in Table  8, this difference is higher at lower reservoir pressure due to more extension of condensate accumulation region and as a result, higher differences in pressure distribution. Also, Fig.  6 shows that the 4 -layer model pressure distribution {{is close to the}} 28 -layer model. It is the main reason for high accuracy of this model in estimating <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor gas {{reservoirs}} {{with strong}} bottom or edge aquifer support, {{the most important}} thing is avoiding aquifer breakthrough in a gas well. Water production in gas wells does not only result in processing problems in surface facilities, but it also explicitly reduces well productivity and reservoir recovery. There are a lot of studies on the prediction of water breakthrough time, but they are not completely practicable due to reservoir heterogeneity. This paper provides a new method together with three diagnostic curves to identify aquifer influx status for single gas wells; the aforementioned curves are based on well production and pressure data. The whole production period of a gas well can be classified into three periods based on the diagnostic curves: no aquifer influx period, early aquifer influx period, and middle-late aquifer influx period. This new method has been used for actual gas well analysis to accurately identify gas well aquifer influx status and the water breakthrough sequence of all wells in the same gas field. Additionally, the evaluation results are significantly beneficial for <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> optimization and development of an effective gas field...|$|E

Meanwhile, the volume of adsorbed gas (GL) {{and the number of}} hydraulic fractures (M) as well as permeabilities of matrix system (km) and microfractures (kf) were discussed in this paper as sensitive factors, which have significant influences on the production behavior of the wells. The bigger the value of GL is, the larger the <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> will be in the later flowing periods, and the differences of production rate with the increasing of M are small, which manifest that there is an optimum M for a given field.

In this strategy, the nodal analysis approach is applied for production optimization and performance assessment of a real inclined well. A multi-layered gas condensate reservoir model was constructed and simulated using actual reservoir rock and fluid properties. Effects of reservoir rock and fluid model simplification on inflow performance relationship (IPR) curves were investigated. Also, five different tubing pressure drop models were evaluated using extracted pseudo spontaneous potential (PSP) data from reservoir model to select the most accurate one for computing tubing performance relationship (TPR) data. Then, accuracy of nodal analysis in prediction of well operating point was investigated through comparing with reservoir simulator results. Results of nodal analysis for this well indicated that a significant discrepancy exists between calculated and actual production rate. Sensitivity analysis on uncertainty parameters, skin factor and drainage radius, shows that skin factor of the investigated well varies between 11 and 12.9 for drainage radius {{in the range of}} 3000 – 20000 ft. Therefore, the problem of low <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> was attributed to high skin factor as a result of formation damage.

The IPR was generated for horizontal well with gas and water coning problems, producing from thin oil reservoir sandwiched between gas cap and aquifer. Two empirical IPR equations adopted from SPE paper by Whitson was also presented here. The first empirical relationship was developed based on simulated data for each reservoir pressure (stage of depletion) while the second relationship was developed based on all generated data. A fully implicit black-oil Cartesian model with total grid number of 1480 and 150 ft total thickness was used as reservoir model. The horizontal well extends through the full length of reservoir in y-direction with only one grid number along the horizontal section which makes the model a 2 D problem. Sensor reservoir simulator and Pipe-It software were utilized to generate the IPR data.

30|$|There {{are other}} case studies for {{investigation}} of asphaltene problem in oil production from different reservoirs. Kharrat et al. (2012) worked {{on one of}} the Iranian light oil reservoirs. The reservoir and bubble point pressure were reported as 9200 and 4500 psi, respectively. After modeling the reservoir, they investigated the asphaltene behavior during production and suggested by controlling the <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> at the optimum situation mitigate the asphaltene flocculation and deposition. Galoppini and Tambini (1994) studied the ultra-deep Villafortuna-Trecate (VF-TR) field. The density of oil was 40 °API, and the GOR and bubble point pressure were reported as 618 scf/STB and 2578 psi, respectively. By measuring surface variables (pressure and rate), they calculated the equivalent productivity index (PI eq). It was suggested that plotting the PI eq versus cumulative oil volume has a linear trend. Thus, the change in the slope of this line would be an indication of asphaltene deposition in the vicinity of well bore. So, from history of wells, one can find the critical PI eq at which the well should be stimulated for asphaltene removal. Sanada and Miyagawa (2006) reported the chemical treatment in one of Japanese oil reservoirs. They addressed the asphaltene deposition in the production separator and well tubing. The density of oil reservoir was around 38 °API, and the formation comprised several sand bodies. After conducting a set of asphaltene dispersant tests (ADT), they used xylene plus a commercial asphaltene inhibitor for well stimulation treatment. They reported the treatment was successful.|$|E

40|$|A general {{wellbore}} flow model, which incorporates {{not only}} frictional, accelerational and gravitational pressure drops, {{but also the}} pressure drop caused by inflow, is presented in this report. The new wellbore model is readily applicable to any wellbore perforation patterns and well completions, and can be easily incorporated in reservoir simulators or analytical reservoir inflow models. Three dimensionless numbers, the accelerational to frictional pressure gradient ratio R{sub af}, the gravitational to frictional pressure gradient ratio R{sub gf}, and the inflow-directional to accelerational pressure gradient ratio R{sub da}, have been introduced to quantitatively describe {{the relative importance of}} different pressure gradient components. For fluid flow in a production well, it is expected that there may exist up to three different regions of the wellbore: the laminar flow region, the partially-developed turbulent flow region, and the fully-developed turbulent flow region. The laminar flow region is located near the well toe, the partially-turbulent flow region lies {{in the middle of the}} wellbore, while the fully-developed turbulent flow region is at the downstream end or the heel of the wellbore. Length of each region depends on fluid properties, wellbore geometry and flow rate. As the distance from the well toe increases, flow rate in the wellbore increases and the ratios R{sub af} and R{sub da} decrease. Consequently accelerational and inflow-directional pressure drops have the greatest impact in the toe region of the wellbore. Near the well heel the local wellbore flow rate becomes large and close to the total <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate,</b> here R{sub af} and R{sub da} are small, therefore, both the accelerational and inflow-directional pressure drops can be neglected...|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the reasons for low production rate in a producing well of a supergiant gas condensate reservoir. An integrated strategy was proposed and employed for production optimization and troubleshooting the well problem. In this strategy, nodal analysis approach was used for investigation of well performance. IPR and TPR curves were plotted through reservoir and well simulation. Effects of simplifying reservoir rock and fluid model on IPR curves were assessed due to difficulties and the high amount of time consumed when extracting IPR curves from compositional simulation of 28 -layer model. It was found that oversimplification of a multilayer reservoir into a single layer leads to a non-realistic IPR model which may result in an operating point different from that observed in a gas well. Also, different pressure distributions caused a significant difference between the estimated well production rates from single-layer and 28 -layer model. This difference increased by decreasing reservoir pressure. The 4 -layer model had high accuracy compared to real reservoir model and showed pressure distribution approximately similar to the 28 -layer model. Five different tubing pressure drop models were examined using the rational elicited PSP data from reservoir model for selecting the optimal model. Among these correlations, the Gary’s model was found as the optimum pressure drop model for computing TPR curves. Nodal analysis accuracy in prediction of well operating point was confirmed through its good agreement with the results gained from running base constructed reservoir and well models. Results of nodal analysis for real inclined well indicated that a striking difference exists between calculated and actual production rate. Sensitivity analysis conducted on two uncertain parameters including skin factor and drainage radius indicated that skin factor of investigated well is 11.67 for drainage radius of 10, 000 ft. Therefore, the problem of low <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate</b> was attributed to this high skin factor as a result of formation damage skin near wellbore. Also, results indicated that maximum 73 % increment in gas production of the well can be achieved by reduction of this skin factor.|$|E
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of horizontal drilling {{in recent years has}} shown that horizontal wells can be successfully used both at the initial and late stages of development. This {{is due to the fact}} that horizontal wells, in contrast to vertical wells, contact a larger area of ​​the productive formation, while the surface of drainage of the oil-saturated layer, productivity of the wells due to the formation of cracks, and also the influence on thin layers increases. One of the methods of impact on the reservoir is the steam-thermal method. The main advantage of the use of the heat wave method in horizontal wells is a significant increase in the <b>well</b> <b>production</b> <b>rate,</b> a decrease in the water cut of the reservoir, a decrease in the oil viscosity, an increase in the injectivity of the injection well, and an increase in the inflow in producing wells. As a result of the total effect, a significant increase in production is obtained throughout the entire deposit. Enhanced oil recovery from the injection of steam is achieved by reducing the viscosity of oil, covering the reservoir with steam, distilling oil and extracting with a solvent. All this increases the displacement coefficient. One of the most effective ways to increase oil recovery at a late stage of field operation is sidetracking in emergency, highly watered and low-productive wells. This leads to the development of residual reserves in weakly drained zones of reservoirs with a substantial increase in well productivity in low-permeable reservoirs. This approach assumes that the initial drilling of wells is a ‘pilot’ stage, which precedes the development of oil reserves in the late stages of deposit development. In the fields of Western Siberia, multiple hydraulic fracturing of the reservoir has been improved due to a special stinger in the liner hanger of multi-packer installation, which excludes the influence of high pressures on the production column under the multiple hydraulic fracturing. Employees of BelNIPIneft RUPPO Belorusneft have developed equipment and technologies for creating a network of deep permeable radial filtration channels under the SKIF trademark, which is based not just on multiple hydraulic fracturing of a formation, but on hydraulic fracturing in each of the interlayers creating a network of deeply penetrating radial channels. The calculations show that the technology of deeply penetrating radial channels significantly increases the production rates in comparison with the multiple hydraulic fracturing technology. In China and other countries, deep-seated, low-permeability carbonate reservoirs are operated with the use of an acid fracturing in open horizontal trunks with two technological innovations at the final stage of drilling: reorientation of the fracture and retraction of the fluid...|$|E
