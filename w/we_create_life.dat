40|$|This study {{introduces}} {{readers to}} the eighteenth-century novel {{through a consideration}} of contemporary social issues. Eighteenth-century authors grappled with very similar problems to the ones we face today such as: what motivates a fundamentalist terrorist? What are the justifiable limits of state power? What dangers lie in wait for us when <b>we</b> <b>create</b> <b>life</b> artificially? The book discusses key authors from Aphra Behn in the late seventeenth century to James Hogg in the 1820 s, covering the 'long' eighteenth century. It guides readers through the main genres of the period from Realism, Gothic romance and historical romance to proto-science fiction. It also introduces a range of debates around race relations, anti-social behaviour, family values and born-again theology as well as the power of the media, surveillance, political sovereignty and fundamentalist terrorism. Each novel is shown to be directly relevant {{to some of the most}} urgent moral issues of our own time...|$|E
40|$|Nuestros muertos quieren ser parte de nuestra conversaci 6 n, no nos permiten olvidar, nos dicen que las comunidades que formamos en vida son parte tambien de las comunidades ausentes. -Cristina Rivera Garza, in Monica Maristain 1 [Our dead {{want to be}} part of our conversation, they do {{not allow}} us to forget, they tell us that the {{communities}} that are no longer present are also part of the communities <b>we</b> <b>create</b> in <b>life.</b> ] The commonplace phrase, 2 ̆ 2 the ghosts of the past, 2 ̆ 2 evokes remoteness, something intangible that nevertheless is ever present, a sort of historical sublime. 2 As the Mexican novelist Cristina Rivera Garza reminds us in the epigraph above, ghosts and the talking dead constitute a historical relationship to a past that cannot be forgotten. They do not allow us to forget. The ubiquitous nature of the ghost in the present also constitutes an anachronism that seems to demand something of the future. The dead tell us that the communities that are no longer present-the historically and physically absent ones [...] are also part of the communities <b>we</b> <b>create</b> in <b>life.</b> Their presence is dialectic, yearning to be part of the conversations of the living, and imperative, a demand for uncovering what seems absent...|$|R

By looking at two seemingly disparate stories - The Story of Kotikarna and Thomas Pynchon 2 ̆ 7 s Inherent Vice - and asking ourselves how they impart similar meanings through varying narratological elements, we can better understand how humans order and establish value in the world, and how humans argue for these orders and values through narrative...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the implications of}} preparing engineering students to enter, live, and be successful in a “Flat World. ” Clearly the exact needs of the future are not known for certain, {{but we do know}} that civil engineers of the future will need to be flexible, adaptive, life long learners. All academic institutions and all disciplines aim at preparing students for the future, at our institution the mission statement begins with “To educate, train, and inspire …. ” While the entire mission is specifically geared toward the unique role of our institution and encompasses many areas beyond a traditional undergraduate education, it holds what the authors think is the key to preparing students for the uncertainty and challenges of the future and their current learning—to educate, train and inspire. The authors feel that educating and training alone are not enough; it is only with the addition of inspiration that <b>we</b> will <b>create</b> <b>life</b> long learners and ensure their education adequately prepares them for a dynamic and uncertain future. In considering the changing and increasingly flat world, the role of the traditional educational process, teaching concepts, theories, methodologies, etc. cannot be minimized. In fact, the role of this type of education is increasingly important to their success. In the future, students wil...|$|R
40|$|Aim of the Automated Assessment Laboratory (AAL) being {{established}} at the School of InformationSystems (Curtin Business School) is to provide lecturers {{with the opportunity to}} have essays automatically assessed using MarkIT. So far, the process was described by using static and non-interactive media, causing misunderstanding or leaving open questions. To improve the understanding and acceptance of AAL, we decide on an interactive simulation, where everyone can chose their role in the system and experience every step in a given setup. For the 3 D simulation, <b>we</b> <b>created</b> the Second <b>Life</b> Island Australis 4 Learning, where a virtual course guides the visitors through the AAL allowing to interact with other avatars as well as objects like drop boxes or presentation devices for the results.

40|$|Design is a {{cultural}} and an aesthetic phenomenon, quite ambiguous, but actually {{has an influence on}} the quality of today’s life and the surrounding reality. It is both a skill and artistry, i. e. "art of life". Design, in the colloquial use is associated with atmospherics, creation of objects and planning, however it is something more and displays itself in every aspect of our existence. Our environment, also home environment is generated around values of contemporary design and around the latter <b>we</b> <b>create</b> our own <b>life.</b> Almost everything what we are doing is connected with design, because it plays a crucial role in all human activities, it is a matrix our life. So design is a base of all primary human activities (creativity). It is also a synonym of all human environment, made by man, so-called artefactual environment and today involves the whole area of culture. Miłosz Markiewic...|$|R

50|$|Hill {{then began}} working on {{directing}} and producing her first serial television series, A Chef's Life. Hill knew Chef Vivian Howard of the restaurant Chef & the Farmer in Kinston, North Carolina, from growing up together in Eastern North Carolina. Hill’s sister and Howard were friends. Howard and Hill collaborated to create a documentary-style cooking show about Vivian’s journey to make a modern, upscale restaurant successful using Southern ingredients and Southern food traditions. Each episode of the show focuses on a different ingredient. Said Hill, “Vivian and I grew up together in rural eastern North Carolina, and <b>we</b> <b>created</b> A Chef’s <b>Life</b> to focus on food traditions in our hometowns and her farm-to-table restaurant in Kinston, N.C. A {{lot of it is}} about her relationship to the local purveyors of the ingredients she uses, so again, the viewer glimpses a world that not many people are privy to, or even think about.” A Chef's Life has aired nationally on PBS from 2013-2016. Season 4 began airing in September 2016.|$|R
40|$|Swamp rabbits (Sylvilagus aquaticus) in {{southern}} Illinois {{exist as a}} metapopulation due to fragmentation of the bottomland hardwood forests in which they live. This fragmentation makes their persistence in Illinois uncertain. We used population viability analysis (PVA) to estimate the probability of persistence of the swamp rabbit metapopulation in Illinois, using a habitat suitability map <b>we</b> <b>created</b> and <b>life</b> history parameters drawn from the literature. We varied the parameters used in our PVA from 50 % to 150 % of the initial value to compare their effects on extinction risk and to direct future management and research. We tested the effects of potential habitat loss and fragmentation by 1) removing patches individually and in groups from the analysis and by 2) adding 60, 120, and 180 m {{to the edge of}} all patches. We also tested the potential effect of dispersal corridors by increasing dispersal between connected patches. Under baseline conditions, the model suggests a 0 % chance of quasiextinction (90 % metapopulation decline) of swamp rabbits within 25 (or even 50) years. Changes in fecundity values and the effects of catastrophic flooding had the greatest effect on extinction risk, and changes in no other parameter yielded any appreciable impact. Removing the largest patches from the population increased the 25 - year risk of extinction to 4 %, whereas any other modifications to the habitat did not change the extinction risk. We suggest that managers focus on sustaining habitat quality, particularly upland habitats adjacent to occupied bottomland hardwood forests to improve the likelihood of swamp rabbit persistence in Illinois...|$|R
2500|$|There is {{some debate}} within the {{scientific}} community over whether this cell can be considered completely synthetic {{on the grounds that}} the chemically synthesized genome was an almost 1:1 copy of a naturally occurring genome and, the recipient cell was a naturally occurring bacterium. The Craig Venter Institute maintains the term [...] "synthetic bacterial cell" [...] but they also clarify [...] "...we do not consider this to be [...] "creating life from scratch" [...] but rather <b>we</b> are <b>creating</b> new <b>life</b> out of already existing life using synthetic DNA". Venter plans to patent his experimental cells, stating that [...] "they are pretty clearly human inventions". Its creators suggests that building 'synthetic life' would allow researchers to learn about life by building it, rather than by tearing it apart. They also propose to stretch the boundaries between life and machines until the two overlap to yield [...] "truly programmable organisms". Researchers involved stated that the creation of [...] "true synthetic biochemical life" [...] is relatively close in reach with current technology and cheap compared to the effort needed to place man on the Moon.|$|R
