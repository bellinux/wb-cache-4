50|$|The {{five animals}} in the {{exercises}} are the tiger, deer, bear, monkey and crane. According to TCM theory of Wu Xing (Five Elements), each animal has two exercises corresponding to the yin and yang internal organs (Zang/Fu). Regular practise of this Qi Gong is said to improve functioning of the Liver/Gall Bladder (<b>Wood</b> <b>Element</b> - tiger), Kidneys/Bladder (Water Element - deer), Spleen/Stomach (Earth Element - bear), Heart/Small Intestine (Fire Element - monkey) and Lung/Large Intestine (Metal Element - crane) respectively.|$|E
50|$|The first {{animal is}} Tiger. It {{relates to the}} <b>wood</b> <b>element,</b> the season of spring and {{therefore}} the liver and gall bladder. The liver's emotion is anger and has many important functions including storing blood (xue), ensuring the smooth movement of qi {{in the body and}} housing the ethereal soul (hun). Liver xue nourishes the sinews therefore allowing physical exercise. The liver is often compared to an army general because it is 'responsible' for the smooth flow of qi, essential to all physiological processes of every organ and part of the body. The hun provides the mind (shen) with inspiration, creativity and a sense of direction in life. The emphasis of this exercise is grasping and stretching. By reaching up to bring down Heaven and reaching down to draw up Earth grasping is encouraged; which relates to sinews and therefore the liver. Rolling through the spine stimulates both yin and yang of ren mai and du mai channels activating the microcosmic orbit. This is then completed with a slow 'stalking' forward bend and sudden shout (release of anger) as the Tiger catches its prey with vigor while standing on one leg, to stretch the sinews while activating the jing well points at the tips of the fingers, opening PC-8 and incorporating another important Wood trait - balance.|$|E

40|$|Wood as {{the most}} {{important}} natural and renewable building material {{plays an important role in}} the construction sector. Nevertheless, its hygroscopic character basically affects all related mechanical properties leading to degradation of material stiffness and strength over the service life. Accordingly, to attain reliable design of the timber structures, the influence of moisture evolution and the role of time- and moisture-dependent behaviors have to be taken into account. For this purpose, in the current study a 3 D orthotropic elasto-plastic, visco-elastic, mechano-sorptive constitutive model for wood, with all material constants being defined as a function of moisture content, is presented. The corresponding numerical integration approach, with additive decomposition of the total strain is developed and implemented within the framework of the finite element method (FEM). Moreover to preserve a quadratic rate of asymptotic convergence the consistent tangent operator for the whole model is derived. Functionality and capability of the presented material model are evaluated by performing several numerical verification simulations of wood components under different combinations of mechanical loading and moisture variation. Additionally, the flexibility and universality of the introduced model to predict the mechanical behavior of different species are demonstrated by the analysis of a hybrid <b>wood</b> <b>element.</b> Furthermore, the proposed numerical approach is validated by comparisons of computational evaluations with experimental results.

The interaction between genetic makeup of wood traits combined with effects of edaphic, local and regional climatic conditions reflect the amount of variation among populations. The highest coefficient of variation (CV %) for FL, FD, CWT and DWT was recorded in population of Gundya whereas low coefficient of variation were recorded in the population of Makuta (FL), Devimane (FD, CWT and DWT), and Sampaje (LD).

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the production costs of hardwood elements produced by computer aided technology of rip-cross sawing with pre-planing of sawn boards. In this procedure, sawn wood is planed prior to sawing to calibrate the thickness of sawn elements and to make wood defects more visible on the surface. Preplaning contributes to more successful further processing of the sawn elements. The costs of production technology of pre-planed sawn elements were compared with the costs of the classic cross-rip production technology of sawn elements and with the costs of computer aided rip-cross production technology without pre-planing. Research results show that computer aided production technology with pre-planing of sawn elements gives the best productivity, the lowest consumption of electricity per product unit, the best control of the number of produced elements, and the best utilization of sawn wood since the quality is defi ned by using wood scanners. Further to the above, it can be concluded that better results are achieved by computer aided technology with pre-planing than by two other researched technologies. The disadvantage of this technology is the starting investment, since the price of this technology is significantly higher than that of other two researched technologies. This research should help investors in decision making process when choosing between different technologies of <b>wood</b> <b>element</b> production...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate K, Ca, and Mg immobilization in the stem of species typical of the hardwood forest of southern Quebec. The species examined included American basswood, sugar maple, and white ash from a rich site, and American beech, red oak, and red maple from a poor site. Firstly, rates of immobilization were evaluated over a time span of 40 years. Higher rates of immobilization in the wood only were generally observed on the rich site. Sugar maple immobilized Ca at an elevated rate during 1978 [...] 1997, in comparison to the other species on site. In the case of Ca for white ash, and Ca and Mg for red oak, a low <b>wood</b> <b>element</b> concentration and a high rate of growth was associated with a low rate of immobilization. Mean annual immobilization rates on a whole stem basis were also determined for the life of the tree. These results suggest that American basswood and red oak immobilize significant amounts of Mg and Ca in their bark, respectively. In a second study, concentrations of K, Ca, and Mg across the radial section of the stem (heartwood, transitional, sapwood, and bark) were determined. In a majority of cases, the bark was highest in concentration of base cations. Whereas, for the woody portion of the stem, concentrations were generally highest in the heartwood...|$|E

40|$|Wood {{is a major}} {{structural}} material used {{in the construction of}} residential and commercial buildings. In situ and continuous measurement of moisture in a <b>wood</b> <b>element</b> of the building envelope is critical in preventing the occurrence of moisture related damages to the building structure, and also helps in determining the thermal and energy performance of the system. Moisture content of a wood assembly may serve as an indicator of the effectiveness and potential condensation-related damage to the adjoining thermal insulation layers in the building envelope. Typically, the moisture content in a wood component is determined by measuring the electrical resistance across a pair of metallic pin sensors, with correlation or calibration between resistance and moisture content already established for the studied wood species. As the wood dries from fiber saturation point (FSP) to equilibrium moisture content (EMC), the resistance typically increases by 4 orders of magnitude from hundreds of k to G. Typical resistance measurement instrumentation schemes such as voltage divider and multimeters are often incapable to cover this wide dynamic range of resistance. To further complicate the measurements, low EMC values of 5 %- 10 % range correspond to very high resistances in the range of M-G, a regime that has remained challenging to measure because of lower current and leakage issues. To circumvent these issues, we developed an instrumentation methodology based on a simple voltage divider circuit in combination with a data-logger with reference resistors selected in such a manner to maximize the dynamic range of the measurement with sufficient accuracy and resolution for higher resistance range. The results showed significant improvements in the dynamic range and resolution for the MC measurements...|$|E
40|$|Aims Leaf area index (LAI) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} used parameters for analysis of canopy structure and forest productivity. It can be determined by direct or indirect methods. Sources of errors in indirect LAI measurements with optical instruments include non-photosynthetic components, element clumping, and a topography effect. Our objective was to find an appropriate method for evaluating LAI and its seasonal dynamics in typical temperate montane forest. Methods We examined the applicability of three indirect methods (LAI- 2000 plant canopy analyzer, CI- 110 plant canopy analyzer and digital hemispherical photograph (DHP)) and one direct method (litterfall) to determine the seasonal dynamics of LAI in three typical temperate forests in Dongling Mountain of Beijing. The forests included a secondary deciduous broad-leaved forest dominated by Quercus mongolica and two plantations (Larix gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii and Pinus tabuliformis). These represent deciduous broad-leaved forest, deciduous needle-leaved forest and evergreen needle-leaved forest, respectively. The optically-based effective leaf area index (LAIe) values were corrected to eliminate wood elements and clumping effects and then compared with the direct measurement of LAI based on litter collection. Important findings For all the three forests, the LAI seasonal dynamic shows a uni-modal pattern with a peak in July. Optically-based LAIe underestimated the amplitude of the seasonal dynamics. <b>Wood</b> <b>element</b> elimination can strengthen the seasonal sensitivity of LAI, especially in the seasonally distinct deciduous forest. The order of LAIe measured by the three optically-based methods in three stands is LAI- 2000 plant canopy analyzer > DHP > CI- 110 plant canopy analyzer. There was good correspondence with the direct measurement LAI for the corrected LAI of LAI- 2000 plant canopy analyzer and DHP. The correction method based on gap-size distribution was appropriate for the LAI- 2000 plant canopy analyzer and the method based on both gap fraction and gap-size distribution for DHP. Considering economics and practical convenience, we recommend DHP for LAI evaluation in these temperate montane forests...|$|E
40|$|Because {{of their}} {{dominant}} {{role in the}} global carbon cycle, changes in tropical forest dynamics can affect {{the pace of the}} climate changes. Today, the only estimation of tropical tree growth comes from permanent plot networks. However, their installation is still much too recent (i. e. beginning of the 80 ’s for the oldest stations) to provide long enough temporal series to answer primordial, yet unsolved questions. Is tropical tree growth controlled by climate variations? Are tropical forests showing long-term changes of their productivity as temperate forests do? What are the impacts of the global changes on tropical forest functioning? An even more basic question is still fully unsolved: how old are tropical trees? Nevertheless, not any sustainable exploitation and management of the tropical forest resources is conceivable without knowing the age of the harvested trees. The dendrochronology approach (i. e. the study of annual rings in trees) was remarkably successful in solving these questions for temperate climate trees. The retrospective analysis of tree growth patterns not only gives direct access to the age of the trees, but allows reconstructing the past effects of the environment on tree physiology over decades or even centuries. However, insurmountable difficulties to identify annual growth rings in most tropical trees (due to nearly constant growth rates over the year) prevented dendrochronologists from using the classical method of ring width measurements. As we urgently need to understand the effects of the ongoing changes in climate and atmosphere on tropical forest, it appears especially important to develop new techniques for tropical dendrochronology. The objective of the project was to evidence the existence of cyclic chemical signals in tropical wood that could compensate for the lack of visible growth rings. The potential of dendrochemical analysis for emphasizing reliable markers of seasonal cycles was tested on trees of known age from three different species: two major long-lived species of the Guianan-Amazon tropical wet forest (Dicorynia guianensis, Sextonia rubra) and one from the equatorial African forest (Pericopsis elata). The analyses were performed at the DiffAbs beamline using synchrotron monochromatic X-ray beam of energy 18. 1 keV. For each wood sample, the radial distribution of 17 elements was analyzed from the bark to the pith with a 300 μm spatial resolution using a Silicon Drift Detector. The results showed that these ringless tropical trees, by displaying seasonal variations in <b>wood</b> <b>element</b> composition, can yet keep an archive of their past growth. Compared to the only previous report established on one single tree, the current study, based on 13 trees, constitutes a much more robust assessment...|$|E
