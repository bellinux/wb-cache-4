Also describes how the Code allowed in a very limited expression the possibility <b>of</b> the <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> the judgment <b>guarantees</b> through the abbreviated procedure. Finally it describes a new law that expanded substantially the use and the incentives for negotiation just in property offences. This last development has divided the Chilean criminal procedure in two subsystems, {{one in which the}} oral trial is still the center of the procedure and another in which the trial will becomes exceptional...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} article the {{requirements}} for <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> informed consent in clinical research on subjects who are patients in a hospital are reviewed. The most important requirements seem {{to be that the}} research must pose minimal risk and obtaining informed consent is impracticable. It is suggested that requirements for <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> consent in research ethics guidelines be modified to exclude the requirement of impracticable consent, but to retain that of minimal risk research, and to add another requirement that restricts modifications of the medical management procedures to those which are minor in some sense. According to these suggestions, <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> consent for retrospective chart reviews are seen to be coherent and consistent. These suggestions also imply that certain types of prospective observational studies should also be granted <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> consent. On the other hand, <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> consent should probably not be granted to any type of randomized clinical trials...|$|R

40|$|Waiver {{plays a role}} in {{numerous}} areas of law, yet no one has attempted to provide a unifying theory <b>of</b> <b>waiver,</b> explaining why some rights cannot be waived and why courts and legislatures have set different standards for the validity <b>of</b> <b>waivers</b> in different circumstances. This article proposes that maximization of autonomy functions as an underlying goal of our legal system generally, and thus the concept of autonomy provides a basis for understanding waivers. It analyzes autonomy in some detail and offers an evaluative framework that functions both descriptively and normatively across different legal areas. There are two senses of autonomy at issue - one an ascriptive sense that refers to an inherent characteristic that cannot be waived, and the other a descriptive sense that can be waived. <b>Waivers</b> <b>of</b> rights relating to descriptive autonomy depend on an analysis of the autonomy, specifically validity, <b>of</b> the <b>waiver.</b> The elements <b>of</b> a valid <b>waiver</b> are themselves drawn from the concept of autonomy. Moreover, there are system constraints that often function to limits waivers in particular circumstances. The final part of this article applies the framework to three examples, chosen because they represent current and important controversies: <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> informed consent to medical care, <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> Fourth Amendment rights, and contractual <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> statutory rights...|$|R
