5|$|After the {{planning}} for the invasion, Dutton took command of 3 Commando Brigade, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> serving in Afghanistan. In 2003, he led the brigade into the start of Iraq War, supported by units from the British Army {{as well as the}} United States Marine Corps, making Dutton the first British officer to command American troops since the Second World War. He commanded his men through heavy resistance from Iraqi forces {{in the early days of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|All work {{to put the}} I-185 into {{production}} was cancelled afterwards, even with the M-82 engine, as they were all required for the La-5 fighter. Another reason cited was that the La-5 used the fuselage of the Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov LaGG-3 <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> in production in three plants and would involve less disruption of the production lines. Another factor may have been that the La-5 required less duralumin to build, something in short supply at the time.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1020s, Maymandi urged Mahmud to invade Jibal, {{which was then}} {{under the control of}} the young Buyid ruler Majd al-Dawla. However, the real ruler of the region was Majd al-Dawla's mother Sayyida Shirin, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> known by the neighbors of the Buyids, {{including}} the Ghaznavids. Mahmud, however, did not agree with him, because he did not feel his empire threatened because of a woman ruling in the region.|$|E

5|$|In 1850, Vaughan and his mining {{geologist}} John Marley discovered iron ore, conveniently situated near Eston in the Cleveland Hills of Yorkshire.

5|$|In 1970, Karanj {{was badly}} damaged after a {{collision}} with the destroyer Ranjit when she surfaced directly below the ship. As no drawings of the damaged portions of the boat were available with the Bombay Dockyard or the Indian Navy, {{it was decided to}} use Kursura, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> docked at Bombay, as the design template for the metal work, and Karanj was repaired within months, in time to join the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.|$|E
5|$|Since the 15th century, {{the area}} of Jesselton was under the {{influence}} of the Bruneian Empire. In the late 1800s, the British North Borneo Company (BNBC) began to establish colonies throughout North Borneo. In 1882, BNBC founded a small settlement in the area known as Gaya Bay, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> inhabited by Bajau people. The first settlement was on Gaya Island. In 1897, this first settlement was burned and destroyed by the indigenous Bajau-Suluk chief Mat Salleh.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{any other}} species of Siricidae, the Sirex {{woodwasp}} can damage relatively healthy trees so heavily, they die back. However, the wasp mainly infests weakened trees; only when the population is high does the insect also attack intact and healthy trees. Because the wasp larvae and the fungus need healthy wood, the Sirex woodwasp does not infest dry or dead timber. However, wasps may hatch from processed wood <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> infested.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} First Army {{realignment}} {{of training}} support brigades, the Department of the Army approved a change of station for First Army - Division West and two of its training support brigades. The 166th Aviation Brigade moved to Fort Hood, Texas on 15 July 2009. The brigade's Active Component battalions, {{all of which are}} aviation units, moved at a later date, most likely the summer 2010 (with the exception of 1st Battalion, 291st Regiment, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> located at the installation).The 166th Aviation Brigade inactivated at Fort hood on 24 June 2015.|$|E
5|$|By {{launching}} such a spoiling {{attack against}} PAVN's long-established logistical system, the American and South Vietnamese high commands hoped to resolve several pressing issues. A quick victory in Laos would bolster the morale and {{confidence of the}} Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> high {{in the wake of}} the successful Cambodian Campaign of 1970. It would also serve as proof positive that South Vietnamese forces could defend their nation in the face of the continuing withdrawal of U.S. ground combat forces from the theater. The operation would be, therefore, a test of that policy and ARVN's capability to operate effectively by itself.|$|E

5|$|Following the flooding, {{the local}} governments in Valladolid and San Enrique {{declared}} a state of calamity to allow funds to reach flood victims. By September26, about PHP700,000 ($14,000USD) worth of relief supplies had been distributed to the affected areas. At least PHP480,000 ($10,000USD) of the calamity funds were sent to the local governments in Negros Occidental. On September20, the Chinese Government allocated ¥81million ($11.8million USD) in living subsidies for those affected by the typhoon. The International Red Cross, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> assisting China in recovery from flooding in August, took preparatory measures and worked with local branches to get damage assessments. The Zhejiang Red Cross branch provided ¥200,000 ($29,000USD) in relief items to the hardest hit areas.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Winton {{cancelled}} {{a trip to}} a Swiss {{holiday resort}} to go to Prague, having heard of a growing refugee crisis resulting from the German occupation of Czechoslovakia from a friend. His friend was working in the British embassy for the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> working to help adults escape from Czechoslovakia. When Winton learned that refugee children could not leave unless accompanied, he decided to arrange their evacuation to Britain. While the Winton evacuations later became known by the collective label of the children's Kindertransports, which were officially being organised elsewhere in other countries, no official Kindertransports had been arranged in Prague at that time.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} terminal building, both the airport's location and surrounding infrastructure were {{the subject of much}} complaint as well. For one, although some 1,700 cars visited the airport daily, the parking lot had only 129 slots, and could not be expanded any further. The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city thoroughfares, in particular the city's main highway, the Tomas Confesor Highway, which complicated the flow of traffic in and around the area. At one point, the ATO, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> having difficulty managing vehicular traffic around the airport, proposed banning cargo and delivery trucks from passing through the road in front of the terminal building. However, the city government did not respond.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's {{force was}} {{originally}} intended to join General William Hull at Detroit, but Hull surrendered Detroit on August 16 and his army was captured. Johnson reported to William Henry Harrison, Territorial Governor of Indiana, then {{in command of the}} entire Northwest frontier. He was ordered to relieve Fort Wayne in the northeast of the Territory, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> being attacked by the Indians. On September 18, 1812, Johnson's men reached Fort Wayne in time to save it, and turned back an Indian ambush. They returned to Kentucky and disbanded, going {{out of their way to}} burn Potawatomi villages along the Elkhart River.|$|E
5|$|Manila {{became famous}} during the Manila–Acapulco galleon trade, which lasted for three centuries and brought goods from Europe, Africa and Hispanic America across the Pacific Islands to Southeast Asia (<b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> an entrepôt for goods coming from India, Indonesia and China), and vice versa. Silver that was mined in Mexico and Peru was {{exchanged}} for Chinese silk, Indian gems and the spices of Southeast Asia. Likewise, wines and olives grown in Europe and North Africa were shipped via Mexico to Manila.|$|E

5|$|The Austrian army, under Field Marshal Blasius Columban, Freiherr von Bender, invaded in the United Belgian States and {{encountered}} little {{resistance from}} the population <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> discontented with the governance and infighting of the rebels. The Austrians defeated the Statist army at the Battle of Falmagne on 28 September. Hainaut {{was the first to}} recognise Leopold's sovereignty and other cities soon followed. Namur was captured on 24 November. The Sovereign Congress met for the final time on 27 November before disbanding itself. On 3 December, the Austrians accepted the surrender of Brussels and reoccupied the city, effectively marking the suppression of the revolution.|$|E
5|$|The city {{severely}} {{suffered from}} the Great Turkish War {{at the end of}} the 17th century and consequently experienced recession until the 19th century. In 1689, Austrians seized Skopje <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> weakened by a cholera epidemic. The same day, general Silvio Piccolomini set fire to the city to end the epidemic. It is however possible that he wanted to avenge damages that Turks caused in Vienna in 1683. Skopje burned during two days. The Austrian presence in Macedonia motivated Slav uprisings. Nevertheless, Austrians left the country within the year and Hajduks, leaders of the uprisings, had to follow them in their retreat north of the Balkans. Some were arrested by the Turks, such as Petar Karposh, who was impaled on Skopje Stone Bridge.|$|E
