500|$|Threatened financially by Burroughs' condemnation, Long's {{publishers}} came {{to their}} client's defense by distributing a pamphlet defending his positions. In late 1903, Long published a new book titled A Little Brother to the Bear. In the preface, he wrote: [...] "Except where it is plainly stated otherwise, all the incidents and observations have passed under my own eyes and have been confirmed later by other observers... I have simply tried to make all these animals as interesting to the reader as they were to me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> them." [...] While The New York Times reviewed it favorably, pointing out its [...] "close observation and loving attention {{to the details of}} wood life", Long's critics were quick to note a number of propositions regarding wildlife. An essay in the book titled [...] "Animal Surgery", in which Long wrote of various animals' ability to treat and mend their own injuries, particularly riled his critics. He told of how animals such as muskrat, beaver and bear were capable of intentionally bandaging their wounds and stumps of amputated limbs by coating them with materials such as tree resin or clay to keep the injury clean. The example that received the greatest attention was the story about a [...] "woodcock genius" [...] who set his own broken leg and applied a cast to the injury: ...|$|E

2500|$|One notable {{depiction}} is Drawing the Line, {{written by}} British playwright Howard Brenton. Defending {{his portrayal of}} Cyril Radcliffe {{as a man who}} struggled with his conscience, Brenton said, [...] "There were clues that Radcliffe had a dark night of the soul in the bungalow: he refused to accept his fee, he did collect all the papers and draft maps, took them home to England and burnt them. And he refused to say a word, even to his family, about what happened. My playwright's brain went into overdrive <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> these details." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Cambridge Circus, Cleese briefly {{stayed in}} America, {{performing}} on and Off-Broadway. While performing {{in the musical}} Half a Sixpence, Cleese met future Python Terry Gilliam, as well as American actress Connie Booth, whom he married on 20 February 1968. At their wedding at a Unitarian Church in Manhattan, the couple attempted to ensure an absence of any theistic language. [...] "The only moment of disappointment," [...] Cleese recalled, [...] "came {{at the very end}} of the service <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> that I'd failed to excise one particular mention of the word 'God.'" [...] Later Booth would become a writing partner.|$|E
2500|$|... "On {{the night}} of the 6th , I got into Camp tired and wet, went to bed and slept very soundly. About midnite a courier brought me a note that each brigade should move with its own ordnance. By a very dim light and just aroused, I read the note incorrectly, that each {{division}} shall move with its own ordnance. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> my mistake I explained the matter to General S. He said that my explanation was perfectly satisfactory and asked me to make it in writing in order that he might forward it to Gen. Lee.

60|$|As to Lady B., <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>discover</b> one {{rich enough}} to suit me and foolish enough to have me, I will give her leave to make me miserable if she can.

60|$|I {{have always}} had an opinion that much good might be done by keeping mankind in good-humour with one another. I may be wrong in my philosophy, but I shall {{continue}} to practise it until convinced of its fallacy. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>discover</b> {{the world to be}} all that it has been represented by sneering cynics and whining poets, I will turn to and abuse it also; in the meanwhile, worthy reader, I hope you will not think lightly of me, because I cannot believe this to be so very bad a world as it is represented.|$|R
5000|$|Suppose I {{was working}} for a {{particular}} nation, but now I am working for all nations. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> admit the existence of nations and say that I am working for all nations, then it is neither humanism nor universalism - it is merely internationalism. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> use the term [...] "internationalism", I am admitting the existence of separate nations, and along with this I must naturally also think, within the nations, of the people's five fundamental requirements of life (food, clothes, education, shelter, and medical care). But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>discover</b> that one nation is trying to thrive on the life-blood of another, I oppose it, and this opposition ultimately leads to world war. So internationalism is not the solution either.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Dave Fanning for RTÉ's Planet Rock Profiles before the Foo Fighters' appearance at the 1996 Féile Festival, Dave Grohl said of Zen Arcade, [...] "That album was amazing. I mean, Black Flag was early on, and then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> Zen Arcade I thought, God, these people write songs, man. It's amazing. It's like the Byrds meets Black Flag, and it just blew me away, and the songs just stuck in your head forever {{and they were just}} amazing. Was that album, Zen Arcade, was recorded...I think it was recorded just straight, and I think they all took acid and recorded it in 48 hours. They did the whole album. That is what I had heard.

2500|$|In 1980, Beam and his family, Ann, and {{daughter}} Anong, moved to Arroyo Seco, New Mexico {{to live and}} work. [...] "We developed a dialogue together in everyday living, politics, world events, ceramic technique, painting, and all things art, that would continue for the next 26 years". [...] Said Beam of the time [...] "It was in the southwest years later with Ann and Anong, who was a baby, that I saw my first Mimbres bowl, or rather a cupboard full of Mimbres bowls in a gallery on the square in downtown Santa Fe, New Mexico. Some were completely intact, some had been restored, but all shared a bold adventurous design. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> they were done 1,000 years ago, I was completely surprised." [...] Beam and his wife Ann exhibited their ceramic work together in The Painted Pottery of Ann and Carl Beam at the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM.|$|E
2500|$|Brown later {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with}} Life Against Death, referring to its chapter on [...] "Language and Eros" [...] as [...] "quite immature." [...] He {{observed that the}} book, [...] "records the first revision of my historical identity, from Marx to Marx and Freud", a process which occurred because his first [...] "historical identity", Marxism, had been [...] "wrecked in the frozen landscapes of the Cold War, {{the defeat of the}} simplistic hopes for a better world that inspired the Henry Wallace campaign for the Presidency in 1948." [...] Brown, who saw Louis Zukofsky's poetry as anticipating the ideas of both Life Against Death and Love's Body (1966), has called Life Against Death [...] "my first exuberant surge of premature post-Marxist energy", writing that in it he had wagered his [...] "intellectual life on the idea of finding in Freud what was missing in Marx." [...] Brown [...] "found in Freud's analysis of the pathological dimension of human desires the basis for a post-Marxist critique of capitalism." [...] Commenting on his intellectual development, Brown noted that, [...] "My Marxist background had given me a healthy prejudice against moneymaking. Imagine my excitement <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> Sandor Ferenczi's article 'The Ontogenesis of the Interest in Money'; with its immortal conclusion, 'After what has been said money is seen to be nothing other than deodorized, dehydrated shit that has been made to shine.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|Amazing Stories {{had been}} out for a year then, but it was Wells' War of the Worlds, sitting innocently on a Providence library shelf, that I found first.

60|$|I {{arrived at}} the {{knowledge}} that this skeleton existed, and I traced it to the particular cupboard {{in which it was}} hidden, by slow degrees.

60|$|I had fished {{from dawn}} till almost six o'clock, one morning, {{and had taken}} two good trout, which were all that the stream promised to yield for the day.
