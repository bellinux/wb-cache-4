In June 2017, it was reported that the band would return to Studio X in Seattle to record a new album later that month, for a tentative early 2018 release. The sessions will be helmed by Nick Raskulinecz, who produced the band's last two albums. Studio X was the studio where Alice in Chains recorded its 1995 self-titled album. According to Inez, the band is not currently signed to a label, having completed its previous two-record contract with the Universal Music Group. [...] "This , we're not sure where it's gonna land... I mean, we financed [...] on our own too, so we're not too <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> stuff. We've just gotta get it out to ... a significant label [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, Obsidian was {{contacted}} by South Park Digital Studios {{to develop a}} game set within the South Park universe. The team originally thought the phone call from South Park Digital Studios was a prank carried out by another company located in the same building. Obsidian met with South Parks creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, with the two parties agreeing that it was critical that the game share the television show's construction paper-like visual aesthetic. Funding was originally provided by Viacom, {{the parent company of}} the television channel that South Park is broadcast on. In 2011, Viacom decided to let the video game publisher THQ take over as the game's publisher. Shortly after THQ took over, they entered into financial crisis, eventually going bankrupt in late 2011. With THQ unable to continue its publishing and funding roles, an auction was held for other publishers to acquire their titles. Obsidian was <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> if the project were cancelled, they too would face severe financial difficulties. Eventually Ubisoft acquired the game, which was released as [...] in March 2014. In mid 2014, the studio announced Armored Warfare, a tank game developed for My.com. It launched in open beta during 2015.|$|E
500|$|The Stone Circle witches' looks were {{designed}} by Twilight Creations (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows). [...] According to McKay, [...] "the witches are awesome in it. Nasty, mean witches, and we'll get some great actresses for them as well." [...] Wirkola {{said he wanted to}} reinvent witches as villains: [...] "I do love Witches of Eastwick. We wanted to try to avoid the classical witch with the long nose stirring the pot. I really wanted them to be...dangerous, fast – they’re stronger than Hansel and Gretel...It’s a good basis for a villain." [...] He recalled that [...] "the most fun was finding their look and sound. For the main witches, we found one animal to represent all of them, like Muriel is a wolf. It just helped us find the witches. In some ways, it feels like they're the spawn of the dark places of nature. It should feel animalistic." [...] Asked if he was worried about [...] "this perception that it might be interpreted as sexist", Wirkola said, [...] "For me, that’s a classical villain from hundreds and hundreds of years ago. Yeah, I never <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> to be honest." [...] He added, [...] "People forget how truly dark and twisted those stories are. [...] talks about a witch burning alive in an oven, screaming and scratching." [...] Ulrich Zeidler's concept art for some of the witches was released on the Internet.|$|E

2500|$|Reviews of {{the novel}} have been complimentary, {{although}} it has been noted that it is best to read the series in order to avoid confusion. As with other Thursday Next books, the novel is peppered with literary references to 'classic' (and not so classic) novels, which may put readers off. Fforde himself was initially <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> concern, but [...] "now I don’t worry so much. I don’t use really obscure characters. They’re ones people have heard of even if they haven’t read the book." [...] – Jasper Fforde.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was later}} in the day, and upon {{a seat in the}} {{presence}} of the green and gold Labyrinthodon that looms so splendidly above the lake, that the Kippses fell into talk about their future. They had made a sufficient lunch in the palace, they had seen pictures and no end of remarkable things, and that and the amber sunlight made a mood for them, quiet and philosophical, a heaven mood. Kipps broke a contemplative silence with an abrupt illusion to one principal preoccupation. [...] "I shall offer an 'pology and I shall offer 'er brother damages.

6000|$|As {{he climbed}} the yellow, grassy mountain-side, working round above the valley, his mind was not {{centered}} on the task at hand, but on Wilson Moore, {{who had come to}} rely on him with the unconscious tenacity of a son whose faith in his father was unshakable. The crippled cowboy kept his hope, kept his cheerful, grateful spirit, obeyed and suffered with a patience that was fine. There had been no improvement in his injured foot. Wade <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> much more than Moore. The thing that mostly occupied the cowboy was the near approach of October first, with its terrible possibility for him. He did not talk about it, except when fever made him irrational, but it was plain to Wade how he prayed and hoped and waited in silence. Strange how he trusted Wade to avert catastrophe of Columbine's marriage! Yet such trust seemed familiar to Wade, as he reflected over past years. Had he not wanted such trust--had he not invited it? ...|$|E

6000|$|Rightly or wrongly, it {{is certain}} that a man both liberal and chivalric, can and very often does feel a dis-ease and {{distrust}} touching those political women we call Suffragettes. Like most other popular sentiments, it is generally wrongly stated even when it is rightly felt. One part of it can be put most shortly thus: that when a woman puts up her fists to a man she is putting herself in the only posture in which he is not afraid of her. He can be afraid of her speech and still more of her silence; but force reminds him of a rusted but very real weapon of which he has grown ashamed. But these crude summaries are never quite accurate in any matter of the instincts. For the things which are the simplest so long as they are undisputed invariably become the subtlest when once they are disputed: which was what Joubert meant, I suppose, when he said, [...] "It is not hard to believe in God if one does not define Him." [...] When the evil instincts of old Foulon made him say of the poor, [...] "Let them eat grass," [...] the good and Christian instincts of the poor made them hang him on a lamppost with his mouth stuffed full of that vegetation. But if a modern vegetarian aristocrat were to say to the poor, [...] "But why don't you like grass?" [...] their intelligences would be much more taxed to find such an appropriate repartee. And this matter of the functions of the sexes is primarily a matter of the instincts; sex and breathing are about the only two things that generally work best when they are least <b>worried</b> <b>about.</b> <b>That,</b> I suppose, is why the same sophisticated age that has poisoned the world with Feminism is also polluting it with Breathing Exercises. We plunge at once into a forest of false analogies and bad blundering history; while almost any man or woman left to themselves would know at least that sex is quite different from anything else in the world.|$|E
