50|$|An {{important}} {{example of}} a cryptographic protocol that failed because of a related-key attack is Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) used in WiFi wireless networks. Each client Wi-Fi network adapter and wireless access point in a WEP-protected network shares the same <b>WEP</b> <b>key.</b> Encryption uses the RC4 algorithm, a stream cipher. It is essential that the same key never be used twice with a stream cipher. To prevent this from happening, WEP includes a 24-bit initialization vector (IV) in each message packet. The RC4 key for that packet is the IV concatenated with the <b>WEP</b> <b>key.</b> WEP keys have to be changed manually and this typically happens infrequently. An attacker therefore can assume that all the keys used to encrypt packets share a single <b>WEP</b> <b>key.</b> This fact opened up WEP {{to a series of}} attacks which proved devastating. The simplest to understand uses the fact that the 24-bit IV only allows a little under 17 million possibilities. Because of the birthday paradox, it is likely that for every 4096 packets, two will share the same IV and hence the same RC4 key, allowing the packets to be attacked. More devastating attacks take advantage of certain weak keys in RC4 and eventually allow the <b>WEP</b> <b>key</b> itself to be recovered. In 2005, agents from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation publicly demonstrated the ability to do this with widely available software tools in about three minutes.|$|E
50|$|TKIP {{uses the}} same {{underlying}} mechanism as WEP, and consequently is vulnerable {{to a number of}} similar attacks. The message integrity check, per-packet key hashing, broadcast key rotation, and a sequence counter discourage many attacks. The key mixing function also eliminates the <b>WEP</b> <b>key</b> recovery attacks.|$|E

50|$|Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) {{encryption}} {{was designed}} to protect against casual snooping {{but it is no}} longer considered secure. Tools such as AirSnort or Aircrack-ng can quickly recover <b>WEP</b> encryption <b>keys.</b> Because of <b>WEP's</b> weakness the Wi-Fi Alliance approved Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) which uses TKIP. WPA was specifically designed to work with older equipment usually through a firmware upgrade. Though more secure than WEP, WPA has known vulnerabilities.|$|R

40|$|Wireless {{networks}} {{are prone to}} security attacks due mainly to the open nature of its transmission medium (open air). Hence wireless network security is more concentrated and complex {{than that of a}} wired network. With the advent of wireless network technologies in the market today, mobility has becomes an important requirement for most university networks. A lot of attention has been given to the provision of wireless infrastructures in the University networks, but little attention has been given to wireless network security in a University environment. The current wireless network security implemented in Universities are weak, making it possible for hacker to break into University networks and hack confidential information of students, staffs and faculty members. This paper addresses how to enhance wireless network security by proposing a pee-to-peer security model with MAC address control, using Extensible Authentication Protocol with Tunneled Transport Layer Security (EAP-TTLS) with certificate based mutual authentication of client and network through an encrypted tunnel and dynamic per user, per session <b>WEP</b> <b>keys,</b> using only server side certificates. This will control access to the network by allowing infrastructures to authenticate users and not wireless hosts using a centralized authentication server system, RADIUS server and LDAP or Active directory server. This will enable users to use their regular username and password. Keywords: Wireless network, Peer-to-Peer, Network security, Authentication I...|$|R
50|$|In April 2007 a {{team at the}} Darmstadt University of Technology in Germany {{developed}} a new attack method based on a paper released on the RC4 cipher by Adi Shamir.

50|$|The Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) is a {{proprietary}} wireless LAN authentication method developed by Cisco Systems. Important features of LEAP are dynamic WEP keys and mutual authentication (between a wireless client and a RADIUS server). LEAP allows for clients to reauthenticate frequently; upon each successful authentication, the clients acquire a new <b>WEP</b> <b>key</b> (with {{the hope that}} the WEP keys don't live long enough to be cracked). LEAP may be configured to use TKIP instead of dynamic WEP.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Erik Tews, Andrei Pychkine, and Ralf-Philipp Weinmann {{were able}} to extend Klein's 2005 attack and {{optimize}} it for usage against WEP. With the new attack {{it is possible to}} recover a 104-bit <b>WEP</b> <b>key</b> with probability 50% using only 40,000 captured packets. For 60,000 available data packets, the success probability is about 80% and for 85,000 data packets about 95%. Using active techniques like deauth and ARP re-injection, 40,000 packets can be captured in less than one minute under good conditions. The actual computation takes about 3 seconds and 3 MB of main memory on a Pentium-M 1.7 GHz and can additionally be optimized for devices with slower CPUs. The same attack can be used for 40-bit keys with an even higher success probability.|$|E
5000|$|An {{attacker}} can try {{to eavesdrop}} on Wi-Fi communications to derive information (e.g. username, password). This type of attack {{is not unique to}} smartphones, but they are very vulnerable to these attacks because very often the Wi-Fi is the only means of communication they have to access the internet. The security of wireless networks (WLAN) is thus an important subject. Initially, wireless networks were secured by <b>WEP</b> <b>keys.</b> The weakness of WEP is a short encryption key which is the same for all connected clients. In addition, several reductions in the search space of the keys have been found by researchers. Now, most wireless networks are protected by the WPA security protocol.WPA is based on the [...] "Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)" [...] which was designed to allow migration from WEP to WPA on the equipment already deployed. The major improvements in security are the dynamic encryption keys. For small networks, the WPA is a [...] "pre-shared key" [...] which is based on a shared key. Encryption can be vulnerable if the length of the shared key is short. With limited opportunities for input (i.e. only the numeric keypad), mobile phone users might define short encryption keys that contain only numbers. This increases the likelihood that an attacker succeeds with a brute-force attack. The successor to WPA, called WPA2, is supposed to be safe enough to withstand a brute force attack.|$|R
50|$|TKIP and {{the related}} WPA {{standard}} implement three new security features to address security problems encountered in WEP protected networks. First, TKIP implements a key mixing function that combines the secret root key with the initialization vector before passing it to the RC4 initialization. WEP, in comparison, merely concatenated the initialization vector to the root key, and passed this value to the RC4 routine. This permitted {{the vast majority of}} the RC4 based <b>WEP</b> related <b>key</b> attacks. Second, WPA implements a sequence counter to protect against replay attacks. Packets received out of order will be rejected by the access point. Finally, TKIP implements a 64-bit Message Integrity Check (MIC).|$|R
50|$|Cracking of <b>WEP</b> and WPA <b>keys,</b> both by brute force, and {{exploiting}} flaws such as weak {{scheduling and}} badly generated keys is supported when a card capable of monitor mode is used, and packet reinjection {{can be done}} with a supported card (Prism2 and some Ralink cards). GPS mapping can be performed when an NMEA compatible GPS receiver is attached.|$|R
50|$|Newsham {{partially}} {{discovered the}} Newsham 21-bit WEP attack. The Newsham 21-bit attack {{is a method}} used primarily by KisMAC to brute force WEP keys. It is effective on routers such as Linksys, Netgear, Belkin, and D-Link but does not affect Apple or 3Com, as they use their own algorithms for generating WEP keys. Using this method allows for the <b>WEP</b> <b>key</b> to be retrieved {{in less than a}} minute. When the WEP keys are generated, they use a text based key that is generated using a 21-bit algorithm instead of the more secure 40-bit encryption algorithm, but the router presents the key to the user as a 40-bit key. This method is 2^19 times faster to brute force than a 40-bit key would be, allowing modern processors to break the encryption rapidly.|$|E
50|$|In August 2001, Scott Fluhrer, Itsik Mantin, and Adi Shamir {{published}} a cryptanalysis of WEP that exploits {{the way the}} RC4 ciphers and IV are used in WEP, resulting in a passive attack that can recover the RC4 key after eavesdropping on the network. Depending {{on the amount of}} network traffic, and thus the number of packets available for inspection, a successful key recovery could take as little as one minute. If an insufficient number of packets are being sent, there are ways for an attacker to send packets on the network and thereby stimulate reply packets which can then be inspected to find the key. The attack was soon implemented, and automated tools have since been released. It is possible to perform the attack with a personal computer, off-the-shelf hardware and freely available software such as aircrack-ng to crack any <b>WEP</b> <b>key</b> in minutes.|$|E
5000|$|WEP was the {{encryption}} standard firstly available for wireless networks. It can be deployed in 64 and 128 bit strength. 64 bit WEP has a secret key of 40 bits and an initialisation vector of 24 bits, {{and is often}} called 40 bit WEP. 128 bit WEP has a secret key of 104 bits and an initialisation vector of 24 bits, and is called 104 bit WEP. Association is possible using a password, an ASCII key, or a hexadecimal key.There are two methods for cracking WEP: the FMS attack and the chopping attack.The FMS attack - named after Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir - {{is based on a}} weakness of the RC4 encryption algorithm [...] The researchers found that 9000 of the possible 16 million initialisation vectors can be considered weak, and collecting enough of them allows the determination of the encryption key. To crack the <b>WEP</b> <b>key</b> in most cases, 5 million encrypted packets must be captured to collect about 3000 weak initialisation vectors. (In some cases 1500 vectors will do, in some other cases more than 5000 are needed for success.) The weak initialisation vectors are supplied to the Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA) and the Pseudo Random Generator (PRNG) to determine the first byte of the <b>WEP</b> <b>key.</b> This procedure is then repeated for the remaining bytes of the key.The chopping attack chops the last byte off from the captured encrypted packets. This breaks the Cyclic Redundancy Check/Integrity Check Value (CRC/ICV). When all 8 bits of the removed byte were zero, the CRC of the shortened packet is made valid again by manipulation of the last four bytes. This manipulation is: result = original XOR certain value. The manipulated packet can then be retransmitted. This method enables the determination of the key by collecting unique initialisation vectors.The main problem with both the FMS attack and the chopping attack is that capturing enough packets can take weeks or sometimes months. Fortunately, the speed of capturing packets can be increased by injecting packets into the network. One or more Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) packets are usually collected to this end, and then transmitted to the access point repeatedly until enough response packets have been captured. ARP packets are a good choice because they have a recognizable size of 28 bytes.Waiting for a legitimate ARP packet can take awhile. ARP packets are most commonly transmitted during an authentication process. Rather than waiting for that, sending a deauthentication frame that pushes a client off the network will require that client to reauthenticate. This often creates an ARP packet.|$|E
50|$|Typically, illegal Internet {{wiretapping}} will {{be conducted}} via Wi-Fi connection to someone's internet by cracking the <b>WEP</b> or WPA <b>key,</b> using a tool such as Aircrack-ng or Kismet. Once in, the intruder will rely {{on a number of}} potential tactics, for example an ARP spoofing attack which will allow the intruder to view packets in a tool such as Wireshark or Ettercap.|$|R
50|$|Red Hat {{initiated}} a NetworkManager project in 2004 {{with the goal}} of enabling Linux users to deal more easily with modern networking needs, particularly wireless networking. NetworkManager takes an opportunistic approach to network selection, attempting to use the best available connection as outages occur, or as the user roams between wireless networks. It prefers Ethernet connections over “known” wireless networks, which are preferred over wireless networks with SSIDs to which the user has never connected. The user is prompted for <b>WEP</b> or WPA <b>keys</b> as needed.|$|R
5000|$|Dynamically {{assigned}} and rotated encryption {{keys are}} usually not supported in a WDS connection. This means that dynamic Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and other dynamic key assignment technology in most cases cannot be used, though WPA using pre-shared keys is possible. This {{is due to the}} lack of standardization in this field, which may be resolved with the upcoming 802.11s standard. As a result, only static <b>WEP</b> or WPA <b>keys</b> may be used in a WDS connection, including any STAs that associate to a WDS repeating AP.|$|R
