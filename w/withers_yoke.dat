50|$|Wooden staves can be {{used instead}} with a yoke, which is then termed a <b>withers</b> <b>yoke,</b> named after animals with high backs (withers) (e.g. zebu cattle) which pull mostly on the yoke part of the equipment, not as greatly on the bow shape borne by the {{stronger}} front quarters of oxen and bullocks.|$|E
50|$|A yoke may be {{used with}} a single animal. Oxen are {{normally}} worked in pairs, but water buffalo in Asian countries are commonly used singly, {{with the aid of}} a bow-shaped <b>withers</b> <b>yoke.</b> Use of single bow or withers yokes on oxen is documented from North America, China, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Switzerland, and several designs of single head or forehead yoke are recorded in Germany.|$|E
50|$|A <b>withers</b> <b>yoke</b> is a yoke {{that fits}} {{just in front}} of the withers, or the {{shoulder}} blades, of the oxen. The yoke is held in position by straps, either alone or with a pair of wooden staves either side of the ox's withers; the pull is however from the yoke itself, not from the staves. Withers yokes particularly suit zebu cattle, which have high humps on their withers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Withers</b> <b>yokes</b> {{are widely}} used in Africa and India, where zebu cattle are common.|$|R
50|$|Although {{all three}} yoke types are effective, {{each has its}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages. As mentioned above, <b>withers</b> <b>yokes</b> suit zebu cattle, and head yokes can of course only be used for animals with suitable horns. Head yokes need to be re-shaped frequently to fit the animals' horns as they grow; unlike other types, a single-beam head yoke fixes {{the heads of the}} oxen apart, helping them to stand quietly without fighting. A single-beam head yoke may offer better braking ability on downhill grades and appears to be preferred in rugged mountainous areas such as Switzerland, Spain and parts of Italy. Bow yokes need to be the correct size for the animal, and new ones are often made as the animal grows, but they need no adjustment in use. Whichever type is used, various lengths of yoke may be required for different agricultural implements or to adjust to different crop-row spacings.|$|R
40|$|Three yoking {{systems are}} used {{globally}} {{to capture the}} power of oxen. These are the head yoke, <b>withers</b> <b>yoke,</b> and neck yoke. Each system has its strengths and weaknesses, with culture and cattle {{playing a role in}} the adoption and use of each system. The neck yoke system offers important lessons in understanding animal comfort and yoke design. Despite its success, the neck yoke should not be universally adopted, nor should it be universally promoted. However ignoring the lessons learned in North America over the last 400 years would ignore animals and teamsters who perfected this system and learned to maximize animal comfort and performance. Using history, research in Africa, as well as farm and competition experience from the United States and Canada, this paper addresses improving animal comfort, performance and welfare by understanding and appreciating yoking systems for oxen. Brief History of Ox Yokes Wooden yokes, usually hand carved from local materials, are easy, effective and economical ways to harness the locomotive energy of the ox. Yokes are simple in desig...|$|E
