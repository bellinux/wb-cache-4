We collaborated on the wardrobe and had meetings about hair and makeup people, we talked {{a lot on the}} phone and met Tone and Rich — two of the best choreographers. [...] ' so sweet and funny and so normal and down to earth. It's really fun as a director to see her in front of the camera. She's so creative <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff.</b> The video is very simple, it's very, very minimal. So it's her, her, her. And she's totally engaging every second. She really knows how to work with a camera and move. I was really impressed, and I have worked almost with every female artist in the business".|$|E

A lot of this music was written when things were really puritanical and women didn’t have any rights, and so there isn’t a lot of embracing of the feminine except with the Virgin Mary, if that makes any sense. Because he and I were talking about music that goes back, a more pagan style of music where {{there seems to be a}} place where goddesses were honoured if you go back into antiquity. And he said, 'I’d really like to see you have a perspective on the carols and write some of your own.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Clark {{believes}} that he was punished not for his undisclosed arrest record, but for causing conflict with producers behind the scenes. According to Clark, after {{he made it to}} the twelve finalists' round, he and the other finalists were unduly pressured by producers to sign a contract, using one of two attorneys handpicked by the producers for representation, or be disqualified from the show. Clark and his fellow contestants' position was that having the producers select an attorney for them was a conflict of interest, a conclusion they reached with the advice of Abdul, who had told Clark, [...] "Look, if you can get six of your fellow contestants to stand up with you and say, 'We want our own attorney, we're not rolling <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> you want us to do,' they will not kick off the rest of the cast." [...] The other contestants decided to support him in standing up to producers, and consulted with Paula Abdul's lawyer, Howard Siegel, on Abdul's recommendation (though Clark maintains in his book {{that they did not know}} at the time that Siegel was one of Abdul's attorneys). Two weeks later, producers began asking Clark about his arrest record, and dismissed him from the show.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the album}} and two {{supporting}} tours, Schuldiner put Death aside to pursue Control Denied with Christy and Hamm. Clendenin was dropped {{in favor of}} Steve Di Giorgio, who was once again available, and an underground power metal singer named Tim Aymar. Though the line-up and writing style was largely the same, Schuldiner created Control Denied {{in large part because}} he was displeased with the harsher vocals for Death. However, rather than betray what the band Death meant and sounded like to the fans, he opted to create a new band: [...] "For me, it {{is just a matter of}} evolving, doing it the right way. I didn't put out a Death record <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> on it. I made the right choice and changed the name of the band. I tried to do everything the right way." [...] As Schuldiner finished Control Denied's debut album, he was diagnosed with brain cancer, forcing the band to scrap plans for a U.S. and Canadian tour. As he worked on the second release, Schuldiner's condition improved, but the tumor left him in a weakened, vulnerable state. He contracted pneumonia and was placed in a hospital. On December 13, 2001, Schuldiner was released and returned home an hour later, where he died. His death was exactly three years after Death's final concert.|$|E

Wilfred begins having sex <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuffed</b> animal, <b>with</b> whom he {{communicates}} {{in the same}} way Ryan communicates with Wilfred. Wilfred also pressures Ryan into pursuing a sexual relationship with a tightly-wound single mother, mainly because Wilfred is infatuated with her son's stuffed giraffe. Wilfred also helps Ryan understand that he was not {{responsible for the death of}} his childhood dog, Sneakers. The audience learns that Ryan's mother can see her cat, Mittens, in a similar fashion that Ryan sees Wilfred. Ryan discovers a man, Bruce, who claims to be able to see Wilfred the same way that Ryan sees Wilfred, and tries to convince Ryan to not trust Wilfred. After a struggle, Ryan learns that Bruce and Wilfred were playing a game to test Ryan's trust with Wilfred.|$|R

Here I am for all my friends to swear to; and yet, Herbert, if you'll forgive me troubling you <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff</b> about myself, not a single belief, or thought, or desire remains unchanged.

After two days of sitting before the city, Savelli believed that he could not hold Demmin, and surrendered on condition of his army not serve in Pomerania and Mecklenburg for three months. This city was well stored, as it had anticipated holding out for a while against a Swedish siege. However, as the city was given up after only two days, the Swedes gained all of the provisions. Among the baggage that was discovered, which as per the agreement was to be returned to the Imperialists, were the possessions of a Quinti Del Ponte, a man who had served under the Swedish and had been paid to betray the Swedish and then desert.

He explained: [...] "The hard truth is you don't have forever to tinker around <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>stuff.</b> The pressing demands of business sometimes interfere with artistic indulgence.

[...] There are reports of group members undermining Brian's control over the album; some additional mixing and vocal overdubs were recorded without his knowledge in objection to Brian's desire for a rough, dry sound. Discussing Brian's production, Carl said: [...] "Once we had finished a certain batch of songs, Brian said, 'That's it. Put it out.' That's why the album sounds unfinished. Brian just wanted to do one cut and capture the moment rather than working on something." ...|$|E
