The results showed that lane average values of HATI in truck <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks</b> were higher than in car <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks</b> for about 60 % of the studied network.

The results also revealed that subgrade soil type and shoulder seal width influenced roughness variations between the truck and car <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks.</b> Overall, HATI values determined from profile data collected on car <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks</b> resulted in ride perception ratings that matched those determined from measurement in truck tracks for 90 % of the studied network...|$|R

40|$|The rutting {{performance}} of asphalt pavement structure {{relies on the}} high temperature properties of asphalt mixture {{as well as the}} pavement structure and thickness.

40|$|The {{movement}} {{characteristics of}} aggregates in asphalt mixtures were investigated with <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> tests under the following loading conditions: reciprocating motion, one-way motion, and one-way motion with braking. The outside <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> tests used fine and gap graded (13 F) asphalt mixtures. The {{tests showed that}} the amount of rutting in one-way motion was larger than that in reciprocating motion. In the case of reciprocating motion, the surface heaved up at the right load end. In the case of one-way motion, the surface heaved up at the point 50 mm from both contact ends of the tire. Consolidation caused the rutting phenomenon during reciprocating motion, and flow caused the rutting phenomenon during one-way motion, based on the movement of aggregates as viewed from the right-angle direction to the loading. Therefore, the rutting phenomenon including the deformation in the transverse direction can be analyzed by <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> tests based on one-way motion, or reciprocating motion, using the conventional <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> test. However, in the case of rutting during one-way motion with braking, the movement of aggregates in the wheel direction caused by tire friction was larger than movement in the depth direction. The inside of the asphalt mixture was dragged by tire friction in the wheel direction. Therefore, at locations where brake operation is frequently needed, the rutting phenomenon caused by flow and abrasion will be greater. 室外で作製した細粒度ギャップアスファルト混合物（ 13 F）に関して，往復走行，一方向走行およびブレーキ走行が可能なホイールトラッキング（WT）試験機を用いて，ホイールトラッキング試験中における内部の骨材の動きの違いを明らかにした。解析結果より，ホイールトラッキング試験による走行荷重直下のわだち掘れは往復走行より一方向走行の方が大きくなり，側方部の隆起は往復走行では荷重端部の右側で生じ，一方向走行では荷重端部から 50 mm程度離れた箇所に生じた。また，荷重直角方向の骨材の動きより，往復走行では圧密によるわだち掘れが主であり，一方向走行では流動によるわだち掘れが主であることが明らかとなった。この結果から，WT試験は往復走行とともに，実際のアスファルト舗装と同様の走行方法である一方向走行も行うことが，横断方向への変形も含めたわだち掘れ現象の解明につながると考えられる。ブレーキ走行を行った結果より，タイヤの摩擦による骨材の動きは鉛直下方向よりも走行方向の方が大きい。これは，タイヤの摩擦によりアスファルト混合物の内部が走行方向へ引きずられるためである。よって，車両のブレーキ操作が頻繁に必要となる場所では，流動によるわだち掘れおよび摩耗によるわだち掘れが生じると考えられる...|$|E

Todetermine {{the effect}} ofwheel traffic and two differentmanagement {{practices}} on soil compaction {{and its consequences}} on physical and chemical soil properties, we measured penetration resistance, water infiltration, bulk density, macroporosity, chemical mobility, air permeability, and soil strength in a conventional orchard (integrated fruit-production program) with bare (sprayed with herbicides) rows and an organic apple orchard with grassed rows. Resistance measurements were taken both within the tree row and the <b>wheel</b> <b>track,</b> down {{to a depth of}} 0. 35 to 0. 40 m. The results indicate that compaction is greater in the <b>wheel</b> <b>tracks</b> under both management methods. Compaction in the <b>wheel</b> <b>track</b> was higher under organic than conventional management. Organic management resulted in a higher macroporosity in both the row and the wheel-track than conventional management.

40|$|Abstract — Rutting {{is one of}} {{the common}} {{pavement}} distresses which led to lower riding comfort for road users and high maintenance costs. One of the widely used tests is the simulation test using the <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> device. In this study, efforts have been made to evaluate rutting of dense graded hot mix asphalt (HMA) using the dynamic modulus Simple Performance test (SPT). Granite aggregates from Klang Valley located in the central region of Peninsular Malaysia were used to produce the HMA mixtures with two different types of aggregate gradation designed using Superpave and Marshall mix design method. The rut evaluation was selected from SPT dynamic modulus test conducted at 40 °C, 45 °C and 50 °C and 5 Hz, 2 Hz, 1 Hz and 0. 5 Hz loading frequencies.

40|$|The {{shakedown}} {{concept has}} been widely applied in structural and mechanical engineering numerical models. The concept {{is related to the}} response of a structure to load repetitions in a resilient manner without further permanent deformation. More than 40 <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> tests were conducted with various wheel load levels for each test to check the validity of the shakedown concept in the pavement foundation. Six different types of soils with different characteristics were used in the <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> tests. These were a silt (from gravel pit washings), a silty-clay (Mercia Mudstone, referred to here by its earlier name of Keuper Marl), two sands (Portaway and Langford Fill), and two crushed rocks (Carboniferous Limestone and Granite). Three different sized wheel-tracking facilities were used; a small wheel tracker (SW), a larger Slab Testing Facility (STF) and the half-scale Nottingham Pavement Testing Facility (PTF). These allowed various wheel specifications and test specimen sizes to be investigated. The test programme embraced one, two and three layered systems. The permanent vertical deformation of each system was measured after a certain number of passes. The soil is said to be under shakedown if after a certain number of passes, there is no further permanent deformation. The experimental result was compared with the theoretical shakedown prediction. A series of static triaxial tests for each soil, with the test conditions close to the <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> tests, was carried out to identify the shear strength to be used as input parameters for the theoretical shakedown prediction.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Asphalt {{concrete}} pavement {{is subjected to}} several damaging actions from traffic loads, water (from precipitation and/or groundwater sources), and temperature. The durability of the asphalt-aggregate mixture, its ability to withstand these damaging actions for long periods, {{is a very important}} engineering property. While the durability of the asphalt-aggregates mixture depends on several factors such as the mixture's properties, construction methods, traffic loads and environmental conditions, they have to be evaluated to predict their field performance. Based on mixture evaluations, the mixtures that fail the test would have to be modified by additives or by changing the materials. The first objective of this thesis was to evaluate asphalt-aggregate mixtures for water damage using the Environmental Conditioning System (ECS), and rank the asphalt and aggregate types based on water sensitivity. The second objective was to relate the ECS ranking of the asphalt and aggregate types to Oregon State University (OSU) and University of Nottingham, UK (SWK/UN) <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> test results, and to Net Adsorption Test (NAT) results. The third objective was to evaluate open-graded mixtures and rubber modified mixtures for water sensitivity using the ECS. The ECS test results indicate that performance ranking of mixtures by asphalt type or aggregate type alone cannot be made for the ECS test results due to the significant interaction between asphalt and aggregate. Water sensitivity in the ECS is significant for combinations of asphalt and aggregate. The ECS test results have shown that ECS performance ranking after one cycle is not statistically significant and does not correlate with ranking after three cycles. The results show that the ECS test program has similar aggregate rankings to those of the NAT and SWK/UN test program, while good agreement exists between SWK/UN <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> results and the NAT test program results. However, poor agreement exists between the OSU <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> results and those of the other two tests. Poor or very little agreement exists among the <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking</b> test results, ECS, and NAT test results in terms of asphalt type rankings. When considering the comparisons of materials ranking by different test procedures, one must {{keep in mind that the}} mechanisms leading to varying "performance" are not the same. The testing reported herein was aimed at measuring water sensitivity, but all the tests do not do so directly. The NAT procedure addresses only the potential for stripping (adhesion) and is not capable of evaluating cohesion loss. The other tests (ECS, OSU and SWK/UN <b>wheel</b> <b>tracking)</b> included all the mechanisms simultaneously, and these provided a gross effect without clearly separating the cause of failure in each case.
