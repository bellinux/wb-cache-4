Replacement brake pads carved from mulga-wood with a tomahawk, or an {{emergency}} clutch plate shaped out of an old boomerang? Spare parts filed in collective memory, and scattered in old car wrecks along dirt tracks? Strips of blanket wound into <b>windscreen-wiper</b> blades? Such is the car repair advice offered in Bush Mechanics, the series recently screened on ABC Television. 1 Presented with humour and enthusiasm, {{as well as a}} large dose of self-parody, this is mechanical advice unlike any other. Nyurulypa ("good tricks") are what the heroes of the series – five bush mechanics from Yuendumu in the Central Desert – call them. They are tricks offered as special knowledge, hard-won in collective experience, and first learned by the old men who tell some of their stories in the series. They suggest a particularly localised knowledge, presented as something that everyone should know, and all who love mutikars will enjoy...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of tetrameric [PtMe 3 (OTf) ] 4 (OTf = triflate = CF 3 SO 3 –) with TMEDA (N,N,N,N-tetramethylethylenediamine) gave the monomeric compound PtMe 3 (OTf) ·TMEDA in quantitative yield. The non-planar TMEDA ligand contains two different sorts of methyl groups in PtMe 3 (OTf) ·TMEDA, and thus offers {{a second and}} independent set of NMR parameters {{in addition to the}} commonly used signals of the Me 3 Pt unit. The additional information derived from these NMR data provides detailed insight into the mechanistic picture of chelating phenomena at PtIV. At low temperature the twisting of the ethylene bridge of the TMEDA ligand can be observed; at room temperature an intramolecular two-step ligand exchange takes place. Evidence for an equilibrium involving a TMEDA chelate as well as a 2 -O 3 SCF 3 chelate has been found. Dependent on the applied temperature, two types of ligand exchange motions can be distinguished by dynamic NMR spectroscopy because of their different activation parameters. These motions have been identified as the two essential steps in the so-called <b>windscreen-wiper</b> process that has been invoked for exchange phenomena in Me 3 Pt complexes previously. Moreover, the data indicate the crucial role of a 2 -triflate in this process in PtMe 3 (OTf) ·TMEDA...|$|E
