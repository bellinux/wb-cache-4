40|$|Native prairie grasses {{of western}} Canada have the {{potential}} for development as turf and forage grass cultivars for semiarid environments. Nuttallâ€™s salt-meadow, or <b>alkali</b> <b>grass</b> (Puccinellia nuttalliana (Shultes) Hitchc.), is a native grass species in North America well known for its salt tolerance. Little information is available about the genetic diversity of natural populations of this species. Understanding the genetic diversity of this species is a prerequisite for developing populations for forage or turf use in western Canada. The objectives of this study were to assess the variation in agronomic/morphological characters and AFLP markers of collections of Puccinellia and identify promising populations and genotypes for turf and forage utilization. A four replicate randomized complete block field nursery of twenty-four collections from western Canada was established in 2010. Plant height, tiller number, crown diameter, dry matter yield, seed yield, and leaf related characters were measured for each collection in the summers of 2011 and 2012. Considerable phenotypic variation was detected among and within the twenty-four populations. Promising populations and genotypes were identified with respect to their superior turf and forage related characteristics. The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique was used to assess the comparative genetic diversity of the collections. Five AFLP primer pairs were employed to screen 15 genotypes from each population, and 185 polymorphic AFLP bands were scored for each sample. Their frequencies of occurrence ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 99 with a mean of 0. 61. The analysis of molecular variance revealed more than 96 % of the total AFLP variation resided within populations. Populations were not highly differentiated with only 4 % of the total AFLP variation residing among populations. A Mantel test revealed a significant but low correlation between genetic and geographic distances (r= 0. 293; P= 0. 024) and non-significant correlation between genetic and phenotypic distances (r= 0. 070; P= 0. 282). Implications for P. nuttalliana conservation, germplasm sampling, and cultivar development are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Conservation of rare {{habitats}} and species are central {{elements in the}} management of semi-natural grasslands of high biodiversity. Understanding the impacts of various abiotic and biotic interactions and management methods on threatened species is fundamental to their conservation. In the present study, effects of competition, plant parasitism, grazing and mowing were studied at the community level in Bothnian Bay coastal meadows and in greenhouse. This was the first time when the impacts of various biotic interactions on the critically endangered creeping <b>alkali</b> <b>grass</b> (Puccinellia phryganodes) have been explored in detail in one of its rare occurrences in the boreal vegetation zone in Europe. In addition, questions related to ecological and economical sustainability of cattle grazing on coastal meadows were examined. Puccinellia phryganodes was found to suffer severely from competition with taller graminoids. Simulated and actual grazing by greylag goose, Anser anser, as well as infection by a hemiparasitic plant, Odontites litoralis, were found to indirectly benefit P. phryganodes by decreasing the competitive advantage of its competitors. In spite of the relatively intensive grazing by greylag goose in the field, P. phryganodes experienced a drastic decrease during four years in the grazed experimental quadrats and simultaneously the proportion of the taller graminoids increased substantially. Primary succession of coastal meadow vegetation was found to progress rapidly and continuous formation of suitable open habitats is therefore crucial for the subordinate species. Mowing was found to be an effective management method for some threatened plant species in coastal meadows, but not for P. phryganodes, which would probably benefit more, for example, from livestock grazing. Both lightly and rather intensively managed large open meadows could provide optimal habitats for the critically endangered lesser white fronted goose (Anser erythropus) {{as well as for the}} greylag goose. The relatively low and variable yield of the coastal meadow vegetation compared to that of cultivated grasslands sets limits how management by cattle grazing can be implemented. Key factors for both the biodiversity management and livestock production in coastal meadows are timing of the grazing season, intensity of grazing and selection of suitable types of animals...|$|R
40|$|Rapid blight {{disease is}} a {{potentially}} devastating disease on cool season overseed turfs when irrigated with saline water. A two year test was conducted on a closely mowed Tifgreen bermudagrass turf which was infected with visual symptoms of necrotic patches of turf, and various degrees of blighting. The test included a broad representation of turf species for overseeding {{in an effort to}} (1) determine selected specie/cultivar susceptibility and disease expression to rapid blight in the field and (2) survey and assess the association of laboratory isolate detection from field sampling, with disease occurrence and severity of expression of field maintained overseed turf. Over a two year period, Rapid blight, caused by Labyrinthula terrestris was capable of infesting most cool season grasses in this test. In year one, Dawson CRF, SRX 555 slender creeping red fescue, and SR 105210 slender creeping red fescue showed no positive lab detection results from field plots. In year two (2003 - 2004), only SRX 555 SLQ had only 1 plot known to carry Labyrinthula throughout the main infestation season. In year two, essentially all turf plots showed some symptomology of disease expression. This was confirmed by lab identification. Tiller infection rates varied from 2 % to 80 % infection in the lab from field samples. The relationship between tiller infection rates and field plot disease expression was determined by Pearsonâ€™s product and Spearman Rank correlation coefficients. Field plot disease scores were correlated with percent tiller infection rates, RÂ² = - 0. 56 plot basis, and RÂ² = â€“ 0. 71 treatment mean basis, respectively. Spearman Rank correlation coefficients were RÂ² =; - 0. 62 on a plot basis, and RÂ² =â€“ 0. 78 based on treatment means Agreement between the disease condition (yes/no) vs. lab findings (positive/negative) occurred on 51 of 59 plot cases, and was significant compared to chance alone occurrences. Over two years, entries which had low disease scores included Fultâ€™s <b>alkali</b> <b>grass,</b> Dawson creeping red fescue, SRX 555 SLQ slender creeping red fescue, SR 5210 slender creeping red fescue, and Providence creeping bentgrass.

Unlike expensive chemical and mechanical controls of tamarisk that often must be repeated, tamarisk biological control does not harm native flora and is self-sustaining in the environment. Recovery of native riparian grasses can be quite rapid under the once closed canopy of repeatedly defoliated tamarisk. However, tamarisk beetle defoliation can locally reduce nesting habitat for riparian woodland birds until native woodland flora are able to return. In some areas, tamarisk may be replaced by grasslands or shrublands, resulting in losses of riparian forest habitats for birds (Tracy and DeLoach 1999). Releases of tamarisk beetles in southern California, Arizona, and along the Rio Grande in western New Mexico, are currently delayed until concerns can be resolved regarding safety of tamarisk biological control to nesting habitats of the federally endangered southwestern willow flycatcher, Empidonax traillii Audubon subspecies extimus Phillips, which will nest in tamarisk (see DeLoach et al. 2000, Dudley and DeLoach 2004).|$|R

40|$|Grasses are {{abundant}} in many climatic {{regions of the}} world and have been regarded as weeds by many. This work investigated the use of Pennisetum purpureum (Napier grass) in the production of bioethanol. Two pretreated grasses were compared as the initial substance in the hydrolysis process followed by bacteria fermentation. For the purpose of breaking down lignin, <b>alkali</b> pretreatment, where <b>grass</b> was soaked in 7 % NaOH, was used. For biological pretreatment, grass was incubated for 3 weeks with the white-rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Both types of pretreated materials were subjected to Trichoderma reesei ATCC 26921 enzyme hydrolysis. Glucose content from alkali-pretreated samples was 1. 6 -fold higher than fungus-pretreated samples. Hydrolysates from the pretreatments were fermented using the ethanol insensitive strain Escherichia coli K 011. After 24 hours of fermentation, the ethanol yield from alkali-pretreated material was 1. 5 times higher than the biological-pretreated material. It can be concluded that NaOH-pretreated enzyme hydrolysate had a better ethanol yield compared to biological-pretreated enzyme hydrolysate, but biological-pretreated enzyme hydrolysate had better ethanol conversion efficiency, which was 18. 5 g/g. These results indicated that wild grass is capable of becoming an important biomass for small local bioethanol production...|$|R
