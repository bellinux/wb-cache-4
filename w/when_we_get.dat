5|$|But Beyoncé is {{far from}} being all sentiment. Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as a euphemism for her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'. And in maybe the wildest moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of Julianne Moore's 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|E

Obama said that [...] "The best thing about Joe is that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, {{to look at things}} from every angle, and that is very valuable for me." [...] Another senior Obama advisor said Biden [...] "is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are as intellectually honest as possible." [...] On June 11, 2010, Biden represented the United States at the opening ceremony of the World Cup, attended the England v. U.S. game which was tied 1–1, and visited Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa.|$|E
500|$|... "Masterpiece" [...] is a midtempo pop ballad {{featuring}} basic {{recording and}} production by Orbit. It {{was recorded in}} two locations, 3:20 Studios, Los Angeles, California and MSR Studios, New York, New York. Madonna reflected on the recording sessions with Orbit: [...] "We've worked on stuff {{for so many years}} that we kind of finish each other's sentences. He knows my taste and what I like. Magic happens <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> into a recording studio together." [...] Additional production came from Harry, who also played acoustic guitars, keyboards, vocoder and did the programming for the track. Demacio [...] "Demo" [...] Castellon mixed and engineered the song with help from Frank Filipetti, while Angie Teo did additional engineering and editing. Other personnel working on [...] "Masterpiece" [...] was Ron Taylor who did protools editing and further editing from Stephen [...] "The Koz" [...] Kozmeniuk.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews, {{with one}} calling {{it one of}} the worst episodes of The Office to air. Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club wrote that his favorite element of the episode concerned Toby and his relationship with God, but he was slightly critical of the [...] "A-story", calling it [...] "inert." [...] Despite this, McNutt felt that the episode portrayed Michael as [...] "a flawed, yet normal, man". He felt that the episode, like the sixth season episode [...] "Scott's Tots", illustrated that Michael was still [...] "searching for his identity despite being over 40." [...] He ultimately gave the episode a [...] "B+". Joel Keller of AOL's TV Squad praised Michael's maturity in the episode, saying [...] "even <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> an episode that didn't quite hit the mark, like last night's, the maturing of Michael still makes the episode interesting to watch." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> there, they already know how to play our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E
500|$|Record {{producer}} Greg Fidelman {{said that}} [...] "the {{fact that the}} songs were still new and fresh to them, and they hadn't been playing them for six months in rehearsal, kept the vibe and excitement in the studio very high." [...] Vocalist Tom Araya said that there [...] "are two principal music writers in this band, so you're {{going to get a}} combination of speed and heaviness," [...] and later said that the [...] "writing is really aggressive and fast, while Jeff likes things to be fast, but with melodies and grooves. In making this album, we seemed to share the same vision from song ideas to titles; <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> together as Slayer, it just happens, nothing is contrived, it's not thought out, we just do it, and we did that with this new album." [...] Lombardo said that Hanneman's writing and performance had [...] "gone back to this great punk energy, especially with 'Psychopathy Red'." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the launch}} {{was not without}} its {{problems}} when three major supermarkets did not stock copies. On launch day, Sainsbury's said that its tills had not been updated in time {{to enable them to}} sell the paper, but that it would begin doing so from the following day, while Tesco and Morrisons planned to monitor sales before deciding whether or not to stock it. Morrisons also said that it did not have the space to sell the newspaper without doing so at the expense of local titles. On 27 November, The Guardian reported that the distribution issues had been resolved, while STV News suggested the distribution problems were responsible for the fewer number of printed copies {{in the latter part of}} the launch week. Stewart Kirkpatrick, the former digital chief of Yes Scotland noted that The National had no digital presence at the time of its launch, something that prompted him to observe [...] "We're in the age of 'digital first' not 'digital <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> round to it'." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} the new project, drummer Rob Bourdon said, [...] "We tend to be perfectionists and it's sort of how we work. We {{like being in the}} studio and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> in there we write a ton of material." [...] Bourdon said the album was a {{challenge}} to complete; he said, [...] "We've been making music for a long time so one of the challenges was to evolve and make something to keep us interested and also {{have a lot of fun}} in the process. We've been used to making a certain type of music and using sounds to accomplish that. So to break out of that and push ourselves to grow is definitely challenging." [...] Shinoda later said the album was not a concept record, saying, [...] "People asked us if it's a concept record, and in the middle of the process, we were contemplating whether or not that was what we wanted to do," [...] although he said that eventually, A Thousand Suns at its completion has no narrative and is [...] "more abstract" [...] than many concept albums.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker {{called the}} episode [...] "at once cool-looking, heart-tugging, and pretty simple", {{especially}} {{when compared to}} previous episodes like [...] "White Tulip". Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded the episode with an A, explaining [...] "I can't really find anything to complain about here. The direction was effectively moody and snappy, the performances were sharp, and the case was cool." [...] Murray praised the subtle characteristics of the parallel universe, the action scenes, {{and the use of}} split-screens to visually show Milo's predictions. MTV's Josh Wigler believed that the episode [...] "demonstrated how the mystery-of-the-week format can still be compelling: by taking everything familiar and applying a stark new layer of paint." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "The third season of Fringe continues to get better with each episode. Most importantly, it has momentum. It's moving forward with a distinct destination, and even though I know Fringe is heading somewhere, I have no idea where that might be, or what's going to happen <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> there. Boy, if you're not watching Fringe, you're missing out." ...|$|E
500|$|Lou Lombardo, having {{previously}} worked with Peckinpah on Noon Wine, was personally {{hired by the}} director to edit The Wild Bunch. Peckinpah had wanted an editor who would be loyal to him. Lombardo's youth was also a plus, as he was not bound by traditional conventions. One of Lombardo's first contributions was to show Peckinpah an episode of the TV series Felony Squad he edited in 1967. The episode, entitled [...] "My Mommy Got Lost", included a slow motion sequence where Joe Don Baker is shot by the police. The scene mixed slow motion with normal speed, having been filmed at 24 frames per second but triple printed optically at 72 frames per second. [...] Peckinpah was reportedly thrilled and told Lombardo: [...] "Let's try some of that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> down to Mexico!" [...] The director would film the major shootouts with six cameras, operating at various film rates, including 24 frames per second, 30 frames per second, 60 frames per second, 90 frames per second, and 120 frames per second. When the scenes were eventually cut together, the action would shift from slow to fast to slower still, giving time an elastic quality never before seen in motion pictures up to that time.|$|E

500|$|The {{books have}} also been widely critiqued as promoting, normalizing, and idealizing an emotionally and {{physically}} abusive relationship. Sci-fi website io9 noted that Bella and Edward's relationship meets all fifteen criteria set by the National Domestic Violence Hotline for being in an abusive relationship. L. Lee Butler of Young Adult Library Services Association commented how he was unusually hesitant to stock the Twilight books in his library because he felt the books were [...] "robbing [...] of agency and normalizing stalking and abusive behavior." [...] Many female-oriented and feminist media outlets, like Jezebel, The Frisky, and Salon.com have decried Twilight as promoting an anti-woman message. Bitch magazine stated the novels [...] "had created a new, popular genre of [...] "abstinence porn", concluding that, [...] "In reality, the abstinence message—wrapped in the genre of abstinence porn—objectifies Bella in the same ways that 'real' porn might. The Twilight books conflate Bella losing her virginity {{with the loss of}} other things, including her sense of self and her very life. Such a high-stakes treatment of abstinence reinforces the idea that Bella is powerless, an object, a fact that is highlighted <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to the sex scenes in Breaking Dawn." [...] Ms. declared that Twilight promotes a physically abusive relationship and an anti-abortion message. [...] However, writer Angela Aleiss of Religion News Service said that contrary to popular opinion, Mormons do permit abortion when the mother's life is in danger. [...] Bella's refusal to abort her fetus, along with her quick marriage and pregnancy, instead underscore the Mormon emphasis on family.|$|E

[...] "Bootylicious", [...] "Jumpin' Jumpin'", [...] "Say My Name", [...] "Independent Women Part I", [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] and [...] "Survivor" [...] are performed afterwards as part of the medley. She introduces the next song [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] saying that she wrote it for all the ladies, [...] "I thought it was something we all need to hear. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> in these relationships they don't work out. Sometimes we blame the man, we blame another girl, we blame ourselves. But I think we should take every experience and learn a lesson out of it, even the bad experiences and I want all the ladies to know that we will never disappoint ourselves. You'll always have yourself." [...] She introduces the next song [...] "Summertime" [...] as one of her favorite songs asking from the crowd to dance further performing a step dance while footage of flowers was projected on the screen.
