5|$|The film <b>was</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>from</b> Oliver Goldsmith's novel The Vicar of Wakefield. The complex {{plot was}} broken {{down to a}} single-reel {{adaptation}} by Edwin Thanhouser and/or Lloyd Lonergan.

5|$|The games {{interacted with}} each other: players could begin {{with any of}} the three titles and have the actions of the first game affect the story of the other two, a concept {{conceived}} by Okamoto. More than ten of Flagship's scenarists, among them Resident Evil writer Junichi Miyashita, worked simultaneously on the three stories. The developers considered using a cell phone adapter to transfer data, but later decided on a password system. The limitations of this system and the difficulty of coordinating three games proved too complicated, so the team scaled back to two titles at Miyamoto's suggestion. Condensing the games into a single cartridge was never considered, as the prospect of multiple endings and the added replay value afforded by the ability to play the titles in either order was very attractive. Oracle of Seasons <b>was</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>from</b> Mystical Seed of Power, Oracle of Ages <b>was</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>from</b> Mystical Seed of Wisdom, and Mystical Seed of Courage was canceled.|$|E

5|$|Enhanced {{geothermal}} systems (EGS) actively inject {{water into}} wells {{to be heated}} and pumped back out. The water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable the water to freely flow in and out. The technique <b>was</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>from</b> oil and gas extraction techniques. However, the geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage. Drillers can employ directional drilling to expand {{the size of the}} reservoir.|$|E

5|$|Our Friends in the North {{helped to}} {{establish}} the careers of its four lead actors, Daniel Craig, Christopher Eccleston, Gina McKee and Mark Strong. Daniel Craig's part in particular {{has been referred to}} as his breakthrough role. It was also a controversial production, as its stories were partly based on real people and events. Several years passed before it <b>was</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>from</b> a play, performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company, to a television drama, {{due in part to the}} BBC's fear of litigation.|$|E
5|$|Si Ronda <b>was</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>from</b> a lenong (a Betawi oral {{tradition}} {{similar to a}} stage play) popular with ethnic Chinese and native audiences of the time.

The Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran suggests that Ronda was selected for adaptation because of its potential action sequences. In the domestic cinema, such sequences had generally been inspired by American works and been well received by audiences.|$|E

It was based on Hecht's experiences working as a reporter for the Chicago Daily Journal.|$|E
