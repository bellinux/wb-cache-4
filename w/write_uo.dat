We show their interrelationships {{and how they}} relate to known topological {{concepts}} such as para-compact and expandable. If (X,J) is a topological space and if n E ~, we say that a cover § of X is n-even if there exist neighborhoods wl,···,w of the diagonal of X such that W ~ c W. 1 for n 1 1 i = 2,···,n and (Wl(x)) xEX refines §. (Here W(x) = {y E X: (x,y) E W}.) If (X,U) is a uniform space we say that a cover § of X is Lebesgue if there exists a U in U such that (U(x)) xEX refines §. If every open cover of X is Lebesgue we say that X has the Lebesgue property. We <b>write</b> <b>Uo</b> for the universal uniformity on X: i. e...|$|E

This ties in with the Maya notion that each month influences the next. The Maya new year would start with 1 Pop, followed by 2 Pop, {{all the way through}} to 19 Pop, followed by the seating of the month of <b>Uo,</b> <b>written</b> as 0 <b>Uo,</b> then 1 Uo, 2 Uo and so on.

40|$|During {{this report}} period, Mallory Roberts went to GSFC {{to analyze the}} data from two minor outbursts, which {{occurred}} from 4 UO 115 + 63. Unfortunately, the outbursts were not of sufficient duration to do a unique orbital determination (which was the scientific goal of the experiment). As this report is being <b>written,</b> 4 <b>UO</b> 115 + 63 is undergoing its first major outburst in four years. We are planning on adding our RXTE PCA data to any public ASM or PCA data that is obtained through the duration of this outburst, and combining it with our BATSE data from 1994 and 1995 outbursts in order to learn something about the orbital evolution in this system. We have formed a collaboration with colleagues at MIT who are working on the ASM data for this outburst. Thus, work on the original data will continue, with no further funding, and we are hopeful that some important questions with regard to the orbital timing will finally be resolved. The PSR 1259 - 63 data were originally analyzed by Barry Giles, who reported that no pulsations or flux were seen from this source near apastron. Recently, a new background model for low-count rate sources has been developed for the PCA. We intend to use this new background model to reanalyze these data {{to see if we can}} improve the upper limit to the flux. This work will also continue with no further funding...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We give a formula, {{involving}} circular {{words and}} symmetric {{functions of the}} eigenvalues, for the determinant of a sum of matrices. Theorem of Hamilton-Cayley is deduced from this formula. Given a square matrix x over a commutative ring, define functions Al(x) by the equality det(1 - tx) = 1 - tAl(x) + t 2 Az(x) + [...] . + (- 1) nt"An(x) + "' " (1) Of course, these functions are the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of x. In particular, AI is the trace, and if x is of order n, A n is the determinant and An + 1 = 0 = A n + 2 =, [...] 9 Note also that the functions A t are invariant under conjugation, or equivalently A/(uv) = Ai(vu). (2) We shall give a formula expressing A,(x + y + [...] .) as a polynomial in the Ai(w), where i ~< n and where w {{is a product of}} x and y's. We start with the example n = 3, illustrated by Figure 1. In fact, on this figure, we have drawn all N-sets (sets with multiplicities) of primitive (without period) circular words on x, y of cardinality 3. Each N-set gives rise to a monomial in the At(w), w being determined by the circular words and i being its multiplicity; moreover, the sign is computed as for a permutation (+ for a word of odd length,- for a word of even length). Then Aa(x + y) is the sum of the 8 monomials obtained above. More generally, let X [...] {x, y, [...] . } be an alphabet. A circular word on X is a conjugation class of words on X; recall that two words are conjugate if they may be <b>written</b> respectively <b>uo</b> and ou, for some words u and v. A circular word is primitive if it has no period. Define the length I c l of c to be the length of any word representing it, and its sign to be sgn(c) = + 1 if its length is odd,- 1 if it is even. Hence, sgn(c) = (- 1) l c I +...|$|R
