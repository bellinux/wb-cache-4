5|$|Cecil Roland McKenzie {{was a young}} {{electrical}} engineer employed by the Sydney County Council's Electricity Undertaking. He too was a radio enthusiast, and one of Violet's customers at the shop. They were married at the Church of St Philip in Auburn on New Years Eve 1924. They built a house at 26 George Street, Greenwich Point complete with a <b>wireless</b> <b>room</b> in the attic. The house remains, but has been extensively renovated since the McKenzies lived there.|$|E

25|$|The {{wireless}} power was almost completely out shortly after 2:00 am, when Captain Smith arrived {{and told the}} men they had done their duty and were relieved. Bride later remembered being moved by the way Phillips continued working. While their backs were turned, a crew member (either a stoker or trimmer) snuck in and attempted to steal Phillips's lifebelt. Bride saw and grabbed the man as Phillips stood up and knocked the crew member out. The water was beginning to flood the <b>wireless</b> <b>room</b> as they both {{ran out of the}} <b>wireless</b> <b>room,</b> leaving the unconscious crewman where he fell. The men then split up, Bride heading forward and Phillips heading aft. This was the last time Bride saw Phillips.|$|E

5000|$|Taken up {{from trade}} as a troopship, Oronsay {{took part in}} the Norwegian Campaign, {{including}} Operation Alphabet, the secret evacuation of Narvik on 7 June 1940. Almost immediately afterwards, she participated in Operation Ariel, the evacuation of British troops from western France. On 17 June 1940, she was anchored in the Loire Estuary, embarking troops being ferried out from St Nazaire in destroyers and small boats. During an air-raid, a German bomb landed on the ship's bridge, killing several people, destroying the chart, steering and <b>wireless</b> <b>rooms</b> and breaking the captain's leg. Taking on survivors from [...] which had sunk nearby, Captain Norman Savage steered the ship home {{with the aid of a}} pocket compass, a sextant and a sketch map.|$|R
25|$|After {{taking a}} quick break, Phillips {{returned}} to the <b>wireless</b> <b>room</b> and reported to Bride: the forward part of the ship was flooded, and they should put on more clothes and lifebelts. Bride began to get ready, while Phillips {{went back to work}} on the wireless machine.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 14 April, in the <b>wireless</b> <b>room</b> on the boat deck, Phillips was sending {{messages}} to Cape Race, Newfoundland, working to clear a backlog of passengers' personal messages that had accumulated when the wireless had broken down the day before. Bride was asleep in the adjoining cabin, intending to relieve Phillips at midnight, two hours early. Shortly after 9:30 pm, Phillips received an ice warning from the steamship Mesaba reporting {{a large number of}} icebergs and an ice field directly in Titanics path. Phillips acknowledged the Mesabas warning and continued to transmit messages to Cape Race. The Mesabas wireless operator waited for Phillips to report that he had given the report to the bridge, but Phillips continued working Cape Race. The message {{was one of the most}} important warnings Titanic received, but it was never delivered to the bridge.|$|E

30|$|Nowadays {{a mobile}} {{terminal}} (MT) with multiple radio transceivers can connect to different wireless access networks. Meanwhile, {{applications such as}} voice, video as well as bulk data {{may need to be}} run on the MT simultaneously {{and some of them are}} bandwidth-hungry. However, any single type of existing wireless and mobile networks cannot meet these requirements. Therefore, heterogeneous wireless access networks have become more and more attractive and they have been built up as a short-distance wireless access network to satisfy different kinds of applications, such as <b>wireless</b> meeting <b>rooms,</b> <b>wireless</b> E-education, smart houses, and so on.|$|R

2500|$|When Olympic {{was about}} [...] away from Titanics last known position, she {{received}} a message from Captain Rostron of Cunard's , which {{had arrived at the}} scene. Rostron explained that Olympic continuing on course to Titanic would gain nothing, as [...] "All boats accounted for. About 675 souls saved [...] Titanic foundered about 2:20am." [...] Rostron requested that the message be forwarded to White Star and Cunard. He said that he was returning to harbour in New York. Subsequently, the <b>wireless</b> <b>room</b> aboard Olympic operated as a clearing room for radio messages.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 April, the Canadian ship {{entered a}} large oil patch. Small bits of charred wood, cloth and {{newspapers}} were found and sharks were seen. There was {{little doubt that}} a ship had gone down in the area. Two years later it was learned that the German auxiliary cruiser (Hilfskreuzer) [...] had attacked Voltaire and Thors first salvo from [...] outside Voltaires gun range had knocked {{out one of the}} British AMC's [...] gun mounts, destroyed the bridge and put the <b>wireless</b> <b>room</b> out of action. After 2 hours of continuous shelling, the outgunned Voltaire began to sink. The German raider, which had fought successful actions with two other British merchant cruisers, rescued 197 officers and men from HMS Voltaire (72 crew members died in the action).|$|E
60|$|Towards midday, Jocelyn Thew {{abandoned}} {{a game of}} shuffleboard, and, {{leaning against}} the side of the vessel, gazed steadily up at the <b>wireless</b> operating <b>room.</b> The lightnings had been playing around the mast for the last ten minutes without effect.

2500|$|Titanic struck {{an iceberg}} at 11:40 PM {{that night and}} began sinking. Bride had woken up and begun getting ready to relieve Phillips, when Captain Edward Smith came into the <b>wireless</b> <b>room</b> and told Phillips to prepare to send out a {{distress}} signal. Shortly after midnight, Captain Smith came in again {{and told them to}} send out the call for assistance and gave them Titanics estimated position. Phillips began sending out the distress signal, code CQD, while Bride took messages to Captain Smith about which ships were coming to Titanics assistance. At one point, Bride jokingly reminded Phillips that the new call was SOS and said, [...] "Send S.O.S., it's the new call, and it may be your last chance to send it." [...] (A myth developed after the disaster that {{this was the first time}} SOS was used, but it had been used on other ships previously.) ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} morning of 26 June, a darkened {{merchant}} ship was spotted. Signals {{were sent to the}} ship without response, and after the merchantman appeared to ignore a warning shot, Kormoran opened fire and caused massive damage. Nine men, identifying themselves as crew from the 4,153-ton Yugoslavian cargo ship Velebit were recovered from a lifeboat; the lack of response was attributed to the actions of inexperienced Indian sailors taken on in Bombay. The ship was left to sink, but another eight sailors remained on board, and kept Velebit afloat until she ran aground on the reefs surrounding the Andaman Islands. That afternoon, smoke from another ship was spotted by Kormoran. Maintaining a steady course away from the merchantman until a rain squall enveloped the raider, Kormoran then altered onto a converging course, and closed to within [...] before crossing the merchantman's bow to reach a favorable firing position and revealing her identity. Orders to stop were ignored, and the raider opened fire after a distress call was sent. Within 30 seconds, shells from the raider destroyed the merchantman's <b>wireless</b> <b>room</b> and forecastle, damaged the engine room, and started several fires. Some 48 sailors from the 3,472-ton Australian vessel Mareeba were recovered by Kormoran, and although a boarding party attempted to save the ship for use as a mine-layer, the severity of damage made this impossible. The Australian ship was scuttled, and sank quickly at [...]|$|E
2500|$|Fifteen minutes later, {{the cruiser}} signalled, [...] "Show your secret sign". Detmers {{knew there was}} no chance of fooling Sydney for much longer, so ordered Kormorans {{disguise}} dropped, the German battle ensign raised, and for all weapons to commence firing. The raider's opening salvo bracketed the ship, while the next four salvoes destroyed Sydneys bridge, gun direction tower, forward turrets, and aircraft. Two torpedoes were launched simultaneously with the raider's attack, and the close proximity of the target allowed the use of lighter weapons to rake Sydneys flank and interfere with attempts to man the cruiser's secondary weapons. In contrast, Sydney was only able to fire a single full salvo before her forward turrets were knocked out, shells from which punched through Kormorans exhaust funnel and <b>wireless</b> <b>room,</b> and caused shrapnel wounds to two sailors. Kormorans gunners shifted their aim to Sydneys waterline with their next three salvoes. Sydney responded from her aft turrets: one damaged the raider's machinery spaces and started a fire in an oil tank, while the other fired only a few ineffective shells. Around the time of the eighth or ninth German salvo, one of Kormorans torpedoes struck Sydney forward of [...] "A" [...] turret, ripping a hole in her side and causing her to settle by the bow. After the torpedo hit, Sydney turned hard to port in what the Germans assumed was an attempt to ram, but the cruiser passed harmlessly aft.|$|E

500|$|Beatty in the {{meantime}} had turned further west {{to open up the}} range between his battered battlecruisers and the Germans. At 17:45 he turned eastwards to take his position in front of the Grand Fleet and re-engage Hipper's ships. This meant that the 5th Battle Squadron and the light cruisers were the sole targets available for the German ships until after his turn, although the worsening visibility hampered both sides' shooting. Barham was not hit during this time and she and Valiant, later joined by their sister Warspite, continued to fire at Hipper's 1st Scouting Group until 18:02 when Valiant lost sight of the Germans. They hit Lützow, Derfflinger and Seydlitz three times each between 17:19 and about 18:05. Lützow was only slightly damaged by these hits, which essentially only knocked out the primary and back-up <b>wireless</b> <b>rooms</b> while the shells that hit Derfflinger hit the side of the ship's bow, knocking off several armour plates, while fragments opened holes that ultimately allowed roughly [...] of water to enter the bow. One of these hits also started several major fires inside the hull. The hits on Seydlitz mostly opened up more holes that facilitated the flooding.|$|R

Those shadows symbolised his control. When a messenger came from the <b>wireless</b> <b>room</b> to shift this or that piece in the game, to replace under amended reports one Central European regiment by a score, to draw back or thrust out or distribute this or that force of the Allies, the Marshal would turn his head and seem not to see, or look and nod slightly, as a master nods who approves a pupil's self-correction.

5000|$|In 1906 Britain {{completed}} the battleship , {{and it was}} so advanced that some argued that this rendered all previous battleships obsolete, although Britain and other countries kept pre-dreadnoughts in service.Austria-Hungary's naval architects, aware of the inevitable dominance of all big gun dreadnought type designs, then presented their case to the Marinesektion des Reichskriegsministeriums (Naval Section at the War Ministry) in Vienna, which on 5 October 1908 ordered the construction of their own dreadnought, the first contract being awarded to 'Werft das Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT)', the naval weaponry to be provided by the Škoda Works in Pilsen. The Marine budget for 1910 was substantially enlarged to permit major refits of the existing fleet and more dreadnoughts.
