The 1973 Pirates had to play without Clemente, who died during the previous offseason. Further struggles included pitcher Steve Blass' inability to throw strikes and injuries to Dock Ellis. In 1973, Virdon clashed with Ellis and Richie Hebner, and the Pirates fell into third place, with a 67–69 record, and the team fired Virdon, replacing him with Murtaugh.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Poulton ran out Laura Marsh, {{triggering}} {{the loss of}} the last four wickets without the addition of a run, in six balls, leaving 15 deliveries unused. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Poulton top-scored for Australia with 23 from 28 balls, helping to stabilise the innings after the Australians had fallen to 2/10. However, she fell at 4/45, bowled by Holly Colvin, and eventually, Rene Farrell was run out going for the <b>winning</b> <b>run</b> from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E

However, the Giants won the World Series in five games, and Burrell received his second championship ring.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Healy took one catch to dismiss Danielle Hazell from the bowling of Sthalekar. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Australia were {{struggling}} when Healy {{came to the}} crease with the score at 7/63 after 14.2 overs. Three wickets had fallen {{in the space of}} 16 balls, during which only three runs had been added, and England had the momentum, and 42 runs were needed from 34 balls for victory. Healy then struck three fours, making 15 from 9 balls before being dismissed by Nicki Shaw, ending a stand of 23 from 13 balls with Sthalekar. However, Rene Farrell was run out going for the <b>winning</b> <b>run</b> from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E

5|$|Christopher {{gained the}} weight back and rejoined the Athletics for the 1947 season. While {{there was talk}} of keeping him in the rotation, he ended up {{becoming}} a full-time reliever for the team. Despite this, Christopher was still able to contribute with his bat; he drove in the <b>winning</b> <b>run</b> in a May 29 game against the Red Sox. Over the course of the season, Christopher evolved into the Athletics' closer, finishing the games when the team's pitchers could not go the distance. He finished the season having played 44 games, finishing 38 of them and getting 12 saves in the process. He also had 10 wins, seven losses, and a 2.90 ERA. At the end of the season, Christopher was holding out on his contract, wanting either a starting role in the rotation or more money to remain a reliever. The two sides agreed to a deal at the end of February, and he looked to be a starting pitcher during the 1948 season.|$|E
5|$|In Game 4 (the final game) of the NLDS {{against the}} Brewers, Burrell hit {{two home runs}} (a three-run game-winning home run against Jeff Suppan and a solo home run against Guillermo Mota) in a 62 victory that gave the Phillies their first playoff series victory since 1993. Four days later, {{in the first game}} of the NL Championship Series, he hit a game-winning solo home run in a 32 victory over the Dodgers. After going hitless in his first 14 at-bats in the World Series, Burrell doubled against J. P. Howell of the Tampa Bay Rays on October 29 in Game 5 (the final game of the series). Burrell was then {{replaced}} by pinch-runner Eric Bruntlett, who scored the game's <b>winning</b> <b>run</b> in the 43 victory as the Phillies won their first World Series since 1980. After the series, Burrell was chosen to lead the Phillies' World Series parade.|$|E
5|$|In {{the bottom}} half of the inning, Yankees ace Jack McDowell, who had entered the game in the 9th inning for a rare relief appearance, faced Joey Cora, Ken Griffey, Jr., and Edgar Martínez—the second, third, and fourth batters in the Mariners' order, respectively. Second baseman Cora dragged a bunt down the first base line and reached first base safely on an infield hit. Yankees manager Buck Showalter argued the call, believing Cora should have been called out for running off the baselines; however, the umpires' ruling stood. Center fielder Griffey singled to short right-center field, {{allowing}} Cora to reach third base. Designated hitter Martinez then doubled down the left field line, scoring Cora with the tying run and Griffey with the <b>winning</b> <b>run.</b> The Mariners' dugout emptied and mobbed Griffey, Martinez, and Cora on the field in celebration of the franchise's first ever playoff series victory.|$|E

5|$|O'Brien {{completed}} a hat-trick of breaststroke doubles at the 1965 Australian Championships, {{but in a}} year with no international competition, he swam much slower times of 1min 11.1s and 2min 38.6s respectively. He {{completed a}} fourth consecutive medley relay win with New South Wales. At the 1966 Australian Championships, his times were again slower, at 1min 11.8s and 2min 41.6s respectively, more than 4% slower than his personal bests, {{but it was still}} enough to retain his titles and qualify for the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica. Critics had written him off, because just six weeks before the competition, he was 16kg overweight. However, he returned to his peak form by the time the team reached Jamaica, where he won both breaststroke events with times of 1min 8.2s and 2min 29.3s respectively. His <b>winning</b> <b>run</b> in the 4100m medley relay came to an end when the Australians were disqualified for an illegal changeover.|$|E
5|$|The 2014–15 season saw Newcastle fail to win any {{of their}} first seven games, {{prompting}} fans to start a campaign to get Pardew sacked as manager before a six-game <b>winning</b> <b>run</b> in all competitions (including knocking holders Manchester City out of the League Cup) saw them climb to fifth in the table. After they ended Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season, Pardew left for Crystal Palace. On 26 January 2015, his assistant John Carver {{was put in charge}} {{for the remainder of the}} season but came close to relegation, staying up on the final day with a 2–0 home win against West Ham, with Jonás Gutiérrez, who beat testicular cancer earlier in the season, scoring the team's second goal.|$|E
5|$|Upon Bradman's dismissal, {{dark clouds}} began {{to close in}} on the ground, and rain {{appeared}} to be a possible saviour for England. However, it never came, and meanwhile Hassett joined Barnes. The pair attacked, Hassett twice driving Bedser over the infield for boundaries, and later pulling another ball in the air for another four. Barnes gave Young an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped. The pair reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries, having been prolific on the square cut. He tied the scores with a swept boundary, and having taken a stump as souvenir, ran off the ground believing the match was over. Barnes tossed his souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and Hassett promptly hit the <b>winning</b> <b>run.</b>|$|E
