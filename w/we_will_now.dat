500|$|In September 2002, Arsenal {{formulated}} {{plans to}} reduce its players' wage bill after making a pre-tax loss of £22.3million for the 2001–02 financial year. The club appointed N M Rothschild & Sons to examine its financial situation and advise whether it was feasible for construction to press ahead {{at the end of}} March 2003. Although Arsenal secured a £260million loan from a group of banks led by the Royal Bank of Scotland, the club suspended work on Ashburton Grove in April 2003, saying, [...] "We have experienced a number of delays in arrangements for our new stadium project in recent months across a range of issues. The impact of these delays is that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>now</b> be unable to deliver a stadium opening {{for the start of the}} 2005–06 season." [...] The cost of building the stadium, forecasted at £400million, had risen by £100million during that period.|$|E

[...] According to Rosen, [...] "This settlement is a satisfactory ending to what was a very complex set of issues. Not only are we pleased to settle this case amicably, we've also turned a corner in our association with Accolade and now {{look forward to a}} healthy and mutually beneficial relationship in the future." [...] Accolade's Alan Miller expressed more excitement with the settlement and the opportunities it presented for the company, saying in his statement, [...] "We are very pleased with the settlement, and we're excited about the new markets it opens to Accolade. Accolade currently experiences strong demand for its Sega Genesis products in North America and Europe. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>now</b> be able to publish our products on the Sega Genesis and Game Gear systems throughout the world." [...] Despite the settlement, however, Accolade had lost somewhere between $15 million and $25 million during the injunction period, according to Miller.|$|E

2500|$|On 19 March 2016, Crabb was {{appointed}} to succeed Iain Duncan Smith as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions following the latter's sudden, unexpected resignation over proposed changes to the Personal Independence Payment (PIP), a disability benefit unrelated to the employment status of the claimant. In his first parliamentary statement as Welfare Secretary, Crabb said that the Government [...] "will not be going ahead with the changes to PIP that were put forward.

2500|$|Disagreement {{persists}} {{over who}} originated {{the metaphor of}} a [...] "stab in the back" [...] as an explanation for losing the First World War. [...] What emerges clearly from Thaer's observations is {{that the idea of}} off-loading responsibility for military defeat away from the military leadership originated in the Supreme Army Command. [...] Even though Hindenburg and Ludendorff tried to shift the blame for the threatened defeat [...] - and therefore the failure of their own predications to come true - during the later years of the war, away from the army, there was not at this point any talk of a planned or treacherous conspiracy. [...] But there was talk of the forces having been let down by shortcomings on the homefront, whereby inadequate soldiers and insufficient war resources had been supplied by the civilain authorities. [...] Thaer quotes Ludendorff on 1 October 1918: [...] "Right now we have no chancellor. [...] Whoever gets appointed, there are {{things that need to be}} done. [...] But I have asked His Majesty to bring into government those whom we have to thank that we have come to the present position. [...] <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>now</b> see these gentlemen taking over the ministries. [...] They must now conclude the peace that must be concluded. [...] Let them now take the gruel that they have been delivering to us!" [...] This argument can really only be interpreted as a form of retreat-ideology, and in that sense the first phase in the development of the [...] Dolchstoß legend. [...] It served to obscure the failures of the military leadership, and from there of certain specific individuals.|$|E
