To further improve the fuel {{economy of the}} car, {{efforts were made to}} reduce weight and improve aerodynamics. The Caprice received all new exterior sheet metal, without drastically changing the look of the car. To improve aerodynamics the hood was tapered lower, while the trunk area was higher. The grille was now an egg crate style while the tail-light panel featured three separate square lights per side. All the doors and components within were redesigned to be lighter, including the <b>window</b> <b>crank</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> which now used a tape drive mechanism. Greater use of aluminum including in-bumper reinforcement and in-sedan/coupe radiators helped to further reduce the overall weight of the vehicle. 1980 models were approximately [...] lighter than 1979 models.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the kinematics formulation {{of an internal}} combustion engine <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The kinematics formulation of the <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism</b> is done using vector loop method and cosine rule are applied to describe {{the position of the}} piston. Following the velocity of piston and connecting rod is performed by differentiating the position in terms of the crank angle and connecting rod angle respectively. The acceleration equation with brief form is derived from the velocity in the same principle. Based on the kinematics, the equations of motion of <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism</b> components are formulated for each moving link and platform then, all motion parameters of each component about its crank angle are readily derived. Furthermore the 2 D model is provided by using 2 D Auto CAD software in order to visualize the system and mathematical algorithm solved by using software MATLAB. The forces acting on the <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the torque applied are also formulated based on the angles of the crank and connecting rod. Introduction. The Internal combustion engine is those that burn their fuel which is mixture of air and petrol from carburetor inside the cylinder or compress air only on the cylinder and injects diesel from injector nozzle. These IC engines convert the chemical energy stored in their fuel into heat energy during the power stroke of piston. The energy produced from burning of fuel is used for motion of piston; the working of a four stroke engine is based on simple slider <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The kinematics of IC engine is not altering from simple slider <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The kinematics formulation of the <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism</b> such as piston motion and connecting rod motion utilizes different software and methodologies for which it is suitable for manipulation The <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism</b> comprised of components like crank shaft, connecting rod and piston which changes the sudden displacement to a smooth rotary output which is the input to many devices such as pumps generators and compressors. A detailed procedure of getting stresses in the fillet area of a <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism</b> particularly <b>crank</b> shaft was introduced by Henry et al. [1], in which FEM and BEM (Boundary Element Method) were used. Obtained stresses were ratified by experimental results on turbocharged compression ignition engine with Ricardo type combustion chamber configuration. The <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism</b> durability assessment tool used in this study was developed by RENAULT Guagliano et al. [2] conducted a study on a marine diesel engine crankshaft and connecting rod. Payer et al. [3] developed a two-step technique to perform nonlinear transient analysis of <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism</b> combining a beam-mass model and a solid element model and Prakash et al. [4] performed stress and fatigue analysis on three example parts belonging to three different classes of engines, light automotive crankshaft was studied by Borges et al. [5]. The geometry of the <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism</b> was geometrically restricted due to limitations in the computer resources available to the authors. Shenoy and Fatemi [6] conducted dynamic analysis of loads in the connecting rod and piston components, which is in contact with the crankshaft. Dynamic analysis of the connecting rod is similar to dynamics of the crankshaft, since these components form a slide-crank mechanism and the connecting rod motion applies dynamic load on the crank-pin bearing [...] Shenoy and Fatemi [7] optimized the <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism</b> considering dynamic service load on the component. It was shown that dynamic analysis is the proper basis for fatigue performance calculation and optimization of dynamically loaded components. A literature survey by Zoroufi and Fatemi [8] focused on durability performance evaluation and comparisons of forged steel and cast iron crankshafts. The piston-connecting rod-crankshaft assembly in the reciprocating piston-engines is used to transform the gas forces generated during combustion within the working cylinder into a piston stroke, which the crankshafts converts into useful torque available at the flywheel. The cyclic operation leads to unequal gas forces, and the acceleration and deceleration of the reciprocating powe...|$|R

40|$|In modern {{conditions}} of engine development, increasing {{attention is paid}} to the seemingly minor processes. On the one hand mechatronics achievements made it possible, on the other hand, the rationalization of the use of resources leaves us no choice. This leads to the need of increasing efficiency, improving environmental performance and safety of operation of an internal combustion engine. Therefore, it is time {{to draw attention to the}} phenomenon of change provided the moment of inertia <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism</b> and its effect on engine operation. This impact is negligible in engines with a number of cylinders more than 4 and it can be ignored. Also, it is possible to reduce substantially the only rational choice of massively geometric parameters of internal combustion engine that, unfortunately, is not always possible. This problem is particularly serious in one cylinder internal combustion engines, which include FP 10 C. In order to reduce the impact of the variable component of moment of inertia of the <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the engine FP 10 C to his work, we propose the design of flywheel fluctuating moment of inertia. The flywheel allows offset impact provided the moment of inertia of its <b>crank</b> <b>mechanism</b> for turnover.
