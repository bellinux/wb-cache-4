5|$|Above the <b>window</b> <b>is</b> {{the album}} title {{and at the}} top of the cover is the band's name in a {{typeface}} more crafty than on previous album covers. Though the general design of the cover is that of a 1930s hotel in style, the typeface juxtaposes the general design with being a rather futuristic, science-fiction styled typeset. This is the second futuristic style that the band has used for their name, the first appearing on Vulture Street.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the large}} pendentives {{that support the}} vault are windows, six {{on each side of}} the chapel.

5|$|The east {{window in}} the chancel is {{in the shape of}} a pointed arch and dates from the 15th century; it has three lights topped with cinquefoils and a hood mould. On the north side of the nave there is a {{rectangular}} window from 1865. The 16th-century south transept has windows in the south and east walls: the south window has three lights topped with trefoils in a 16th-century arch, and the east <b>window</b> <b>is</b> small and rectangular, using some dressings from the 14th century.

50|$|Double-hung sash <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> {{traditionally}} often {{fitted with}} shutters.

40|$|<b>Windows</b> <b>are</b> {{one of the}} {{important}} components of building for ventilation. <b>Windows</b> <b>are</b> of various type depending up on materials, purpose and opening types. Wooden <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> traditional type and used widely. They are easily available and made in various sizes and shapes. Aluminum power coated <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> light weight and fabricated as per requirements. It is available in all sizes and types. Cost of aluminum window depends upon the section size and thickness used for the <b>window.</b> Aluminum <b>window</b> <b>are</b> not energy efficient and not sound resistance but it is light weight, low cost, rustproof, and required less maintains and painting. Aluminum <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> commonly recommended for building where high degree of elegance <b>is</b> required. UPVC <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> the un plasticized polyvinyl chloride. Now a day’s UPVC <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> becoming more popularly used because of high energy efficient, excellent appearance and smooth surface. But they are costly as compare to wooden and aluminum and they are not that flexible in design and execution. A case study was also done to see the suitability and economy of all these three types of <b>windows</b> and it <b>was</b> found that the aluminum <b>window</b> <b>was</b> best suited for construction, as it has low cost, easily available & can demolded in any shape & size. Also it has high degree of elegance and good appearance when powder coated...|$|R

5|$|The gatehouse's eastwards-facing tower {{contains}} the chapel, an unusual arrangement {{driven by a}} lack of space, with a recently restored east window of reset 15th-century glass designed by Nicola Hopwood, which illuminates the priest's seat, or sedile. The 15th-century window frame itself replaced an even taller, earlier 13th-century window. The chapel's west <b>window</b> <b>is</b> modern, and commemorates British servicemen who died between 1936–76 in radar development. The altar itself is particularly old, possibly pre-dating the castle.|$|E
5|$|The rain when Jenny and Lindsay's car {{breaks down}} was added {{digitally}} in post-production. The filmmakers {{had not been}} granted permission to film at the roadside location, but went ahead against the authorities' wishes as Six felt the location in the woods was ideal for the scene. When Heiter's <b>window</b> <b>is</b> repaired after Lindsay's escape attempt, {{the use of a}} tracking shot through the window pane required the reflection of the crew to be digitally removed from the glass. The film contains a large number of long tracking shots; Six has cited the influence of Takashi Miike who also uses many tracking shots in his films.|$|E

5000|$|A {{casement}} <b>is</b> a <b>window</b> that <b>is</b> {{attached to}} its frame {{by one or}} more hinges. Casement <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> hinged at the side. They are used singly or in pairs within a common frame, in which case they are hinged on the outside. Casement <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> often held open using a casement stay. Windows hinged at the top are referred to as awning windows, and ones hinged at the bottom are called hoppers.In the UK, casement <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> common before the sash <b>window</b> <b>was</b> introduced, and usually metal with leaded glass—glass panes held in place with strips of lead (called lead [...] "cames"; leaded glass is {{not to be confused with}} lead glass, which refers to the manufacture of the glass itself). These casement <b>windows</b> usually <b>were</b> hinged on the side, and opened inward. By the start of the Victorian era, opening casements and frames were constructed from timber in their entirety. The <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> covered by functional exterior shutters, which opened outward. Variants of casement <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> still the norm in many European countries.|$|R
