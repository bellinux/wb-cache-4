500|$|In the {{following}} season, Hextall remained with Hershey, appearing in 53games during [...] the 1985–86 season. He recorded 30wins {{and the lowest}} GAA average of his career to that point, 3.41. The Bears finished the regular season as league leaders, and won the John D. Chick Trophy as the South Division Champions. Hextall lived up to his aggressive reputation in the Conference final, played against the St. Catharines Saints, fighting three different members of the opposition side during a single bench-clearing brawl. The Bears advanced to the Calder Cup final, having beaten the New Haven Nighthawks 4–1 and the St.Catharines Saints 4–3. In the final, they faced the Adirondack Red Wings, who won the championship by four games to two. Hextall played 13games in the playoffs, of which his team won five, and his GAA was3.23. He was named as the Dudley [...] "Red" [...] Garrett Memorial Award winner, as the AHL's outstanding rookie player. Looking back on {{his time in the}} AHL, Hextall reflected that despite his initial disappointment at not being selected to play for the Flyers straight away, [...] "the two years that I spent in the American League got me to the point where I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> could be a No.1 goaltender at the NHL level." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the book}} was written, Tripathi felt {{that it would be}} {{difficult}} for him to get a big publication house to publish his novel. The manuscript for The Immortals of Meluha got rejected by 35 to 40 publication houses. Hence, he decided to apply his management skills and promote his book. The Immortals of Meluha—originally titled Shiva: The Man, The Legend—was finally released by Tripathi’s literary agent Anuj Bahri, the owner of the landmark BahriSons Booksellers in Khan Market, New Delhi. Tripathi explained with Daily News and Analysis, [...] "I would be lying if I said that I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> would get a big publisher for my first novel. I was a finance guy and a staunch believer in digital marketing that has a better reach in the books market. It actually puts up a conversation rather than a two-minute wire on the same." [...] Together with his friends, Tripathi launched his promotion of the book on the internet. He put up the entire first chapter of The Immortals of Meluha as a digital download from his website, so that the readers would get interested. With the help of his musician friend Taufiq Qureshi, he launched a live-action trailer film on YouTube and built an online community in Facebook and Twitter, surrounding the video, to further hold the reader's interest.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Thank you, Anne,' said Rupert; 'I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> only {{wonder she}} was not submerged. I never could have guessed any fair lady could be so heavy. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> feel the claw she gave my arm at this moment.' ...|$|R
60|$|A figure {{arose in}} {{the bow of the}} leading canoe--a figure that I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> {{recognized}} even before he spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now;--that's {{just what}} I wanted to know. One couldn't write and ask such a question; but I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> should {{find out if}} I came." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's great luck,' I said, 'but I {{have an idea}} he {{is always}} in luck. I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> should have to offer him the second berth in my room.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Papa," [...] she said, hanging {{closely to}} his arm, [...] "never suspect me again: promise {{me that you}} never will. Whatever I do you may <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> shall tell you first; you may <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> shall consult you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed, cousin John," [...] said Ada, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> could not--I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> would not--think any ill of Richard if {{the whole}} world did. I could, and I would, think better of him then {{than at any other}} time!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What was it {{you said}} yourself? <b>Sure!</b> Of course <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> quite <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> do not love him. Did I not {{tell you that there}} could be no doubt after what you said?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, me," [...] said Miss Rangely cheerfully and ungrammatically. [...] "You didn't expect it, did you? I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> {{had seen}} you before--only it wasn't you but your photograph." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's great luck," [...] I said, [...] "but I've an idea he's {{always in}} luck. I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> {{should have to}} offer him the second berth in my room." ...|$|E
60|$|However, this {{confession}} of Aunt Emma's rendered one thing more certain {{to me than}} ever before. I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> {{was on the right}} track now, after Courtenay Ivor. The bicycle clinched the proof.|$|E
6000|$|... "Other {{people have}} said so, sir; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> can't [illegible words] be like her a bit. Mother is so pretty, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not the least bit}} in the world; and I don't think it's nice for a boy to be like a woman." ...|$|R
60|$|HOTCHKISS. To <b>be</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> {{beg your}} pardon. [He alters the draft].|$|R
60|$|JOHN.--I {{beg your}} ladyship's pardon. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> have said nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was going}} to run away, for I shouldn't like to mix myself up in your affair--it's {{certainly}} a very strange one--unless I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> could help you. But if you think I can--" ...|$|E
6000|$|She turned around, {{apparently}} reassured. [...] "You are not {{to think}} that I have been told anything," [...] she said; [...] "I have only guessed. But when I looked at you, as you came in, I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> had guessed aright." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I, my poor friend? I {{like your}} plans and your {{responsibilities}} and your great affairs, {{as you call}} them. Voyons, they're infantile. I've just shown that I'm a perfection of perfections: therefore it's just the moment to 'renounce,' as you gracefully say? Oh I <b>was</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> was sure!" [...] And Miriam paused, resting eyes at once lighted and troubled on him as {{in the effort to}} think of some arrangement that would help him out of his absurdity. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> mean, that if you did come your poor, dear, doting brain would be quite confused," [...] she presently pursued. [...] "I can't be a muff in public just for you, pourtant. Dear me, why do you like us so much?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, miss," [...] {{the smith}} said, {{scratching}} his head, [...] "if you <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of it, and squire <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> suppose there can't {{be no doubt}} about it, for who should know better than squire; and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't go to put him about, for a better landlord than squire ain't {{to be found in}} the county. So you tell him, miss, as I will hold out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> {{should know}} him again," [...] the child said, [...] "though I only saw {{him for a}} moment. We are very much obliged to you, boy, papa and me, {{because it had been}} mamma's locket, and we should have been very sorry to have lost it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear Paul,' {{returned}} his sister, 'you do Miss Tox but justice, {{as a man}} of your penetration <b>was</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> knew, to do. I believe if there are three words in the English language for which she has a respect amounting almost to veneration, those words are, Dombey and Son.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, God, if I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> were to die to-night I would repent at once." [...] It is the commonest {{prayer in}} all languages, but {{down on her}} knees slipped Elspeth again, and Tommy, who felt that it had done him good, said indignantly: [...] "Surely that is religion. What?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not that I ken of," [...] {{said the}} king, in the {{paroxysm}} of his apprehension, (which, by the way, might be pardoned {{in one of}} so timorous a temper, and who, in his time, {{had been exposed to}} so many strange attempts)--"Not that I ken of--but search him--search him. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> saw fire-arms under his cloak. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> smelled powder--I <b>am</b> dooms <b>sure</b> of that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, my dear Loo. I am so tired, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> wonder I don't say {{anything}} to get to sleep. Go to bed, go to bed.' ...|$|R
60|$|ANN. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't {{have asked}} for any of it if you had grudged it.|$|R
60|$|Her {{welcome to}} me was, as I have said, most affectionate, and when tea was over, {{she made me}} sit down in a large easy chair by the fire--for {{although}} it was hardly cold enough for one, she had it lighted because she <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> should come in perished with cold from my journey.|$|E
60|$|I replied I <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> did {{not wish}} to be the cause of any. It seemed to me, however, that the Heer Pereira wished to make a mock of me and to bring it home to me what a poor {{creature}} I was compared to himself--I a mere sick boy who was worth nothing.|$|E
60|$|The {{three men}} came; {{they had to}} wade ashore; and when they came they laughed.

60|$|Why, says he, {{after a short}} pause, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> {{can answer}} for above a hundred.|$|R
60|$|LADY. Nonsense. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not a bit}} English. The English are a very stupid people.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> should," [...] Ronald said, quietly; [...] "I think I {{could make}} her happy, but I fear I shall never have a chance. She has told you what I said last night. I have been awake all the night {{thinking}} it over, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> have decided rightly. My disgrace is hard enough to bear alone; I will never share it with her." ...|$|R
