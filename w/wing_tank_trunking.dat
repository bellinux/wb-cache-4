50|$|The Learjet 25 {{generally}} has five fuel <b>tanks.</b> Two <b>wing</b> <b>tanks,</b> a fuselage <b>tank</b> and two <b>wing</b> tip <b>tanks.</b> Each <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> {{extends from the}} centre bulkhead outboard to the wing tip and provides separate fuel for each engine. A tank cross-flow valve is installed to prevent fuel transfer between <b>wing</b> <b>tanks.</b> Flapper-type check valves, located in the various wing ribs, allow free fuel flow inboard but restrict outboard flow. A jet pump and electrical boost pump are mounted in each <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> near the centre bulkhead to supply fuel under pressure to the respective engine fuel system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ballast system}} has six {{integral}} <b>tanks</b> in the <b>wings.</b> The outboard <b>tanks</b> are filled first and dumped last for better spanwise load distribution. The tail ballast system incorporates two separate tanks {{to maintain a}} favourable C.G. during water dumping. The control of the first tail tank {{is connected to the}} four outer <b>wing</b> <b>tanks,</b> the second tail tank operates with to the two inner <b>wing</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{design is}} an {{enhanced}} Mid-Deck Tanker {{and consists of}} a series of centre and <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> that are divided by horizontal bulkheads. The upper <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> form ballast tanks and act as emergency receiver tanks for cargo should the lower tanks be fractured. The lower tanks are connected to these ballast tanks by non-return valves.|$|R
50|$|The tip tanks provide {{additional}} fuel capacity to enable longer times aloft. A jet pump installed in each tip tank transfers fuel into the <b>wing</b> <b>tanks.</b> Fuel can also flow via the flapper check valves into the <b>wing</b> <b>tanks,</b> but {{the lower half}} of the fuel in the tip tanks must be transferred with the jet pump.|$|R

50|$|At 05:36 UTC, {{the pilots}} {{received}} a warning of fuel imbalance. They followed a standard procedure {{to remedy the}} imbalance by transferring fuel from the left <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> to the near-empty right <b>wing</b> <b>tank.</b> Unknown to the pilots, the aircraft had developed a fuel leak in a line to the #2 (right) engine. The fuel transfer caused fuel from the left <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> to be lost through the leak in the line to the #2 engine. The fractured fuel line, which was leaking at about one gallon per second, caused a higher than normal fuel flow through the fuel-oil heat exchanger (FOHE), which in turn led to a drop in oil temperature and a rise in oil pressure for the #2 engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuel system}} {{consists}} of auxiliary <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> feeding an armored, fuselage-mounted main tank, which sits just {{forward of the}} engine and behind the firewall. The main tank can feed the engine in all attitudes. This tank is continuously refilled from the main <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> with no fuel management duties required of the pilot. By feeding the main tank from the two auxiliary <b>wing</b> <b>tanks,</b> {{the size of the}} fuel tank in the fuselage was effectively halved, creating a large space behind the pilot empty of any tanks or other aircraft systems. This bay had no dedicated function on the demonstrator, but was intended to be left available for any additional equipment which the Army might wish to install in the production version.|$|R
2500|$|The F-4s were fitted {{out with}} the QRC-160 jamming pods {{normally}} carried only by F-105s, so that their electronic signature would be the same, and the F-4s would also fly the inflexible line-abreast pod formations used by the F-105s to maximize pod effectiveness. [...] The pods had to be mounted {{on one of the}} fuel <b>tank</b> <b>wing</b> pylons, forcing the F-4s to carry a centerline and single <b>wing</b> <b>tank,</b> creating an asymmetric imbalance that made takeoffs difficult (the aircraft would try to roll on liftoff to the side carrying the <b>wing</b> <b>tank).</b>|$|R

50|$|The use {{of these}} tanks was pioneered by Frahm in Germany {{at the start of}} the 20th century and they are often {{referred}} to as Frahm tanks. These partially filled tanks consists of two <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> connected at the bottom by a substantial crossover duct. The air columns above the liquid in the two tanks are also connected by a duct. As in the free surface tanks, as the ship begins to roll the fluid flows from <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> to <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> causing a time varying roll moment to the ship and with careful design this roll moment is of correct phasing to reduce the roll motion of the ship. They do not restrict fore and aft passage as space above and below the water-crossover duct is available for other purposes.|$|R

50|$|The KC-135Q variant was {{modified}} to carry JP-7 fuel {{necessary for the}} Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, segregating the JP-7 from the KC-135s own fuel supply (the body tanks carrying JP-7, and the <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> carrying JP-4 or JP-8). The tanker also had special fuel systems for moving the different fuels between different tanks. When the KC-135Q model received the CFM-56 engines, it was redesignated the KC-135T model, which was capable of separating the main body <b>tanks</b> from the <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> where the KC-135 draws its engine fuel. The only external difference between a KC-135R and a KC-135T {{is the presence of}} a clear window {{on the underside of the}} empennage of the KC-135T where a remote controlled searchlight is mounted. It also has two ground refueling ports, located in each rear wheel well so ground crews can fuel both the body <b>tanks</b> and <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> separately.|$|R

40|$|Probabilistic damage {{stability}} calculations are time demanding and are conducted at a late {{stage of the}} design process. A detailed arrangement is required to calculate whether a ship fulfills the requirements. To minimize the amount of iterations in the design process Naval Architects {{have to know how}} the attained index is affected by the watertight arrangement. The longitudinal <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> bulkhead in the mid-ship section of a vessel, is a bulkhead that applies for all offshore vessels. The placement of this bulkhead, in regards to maximizing the attained index, has been a subject of discussion in Wärtsilä Ship Design. The objective of this dissertation has been to analyze how the attained index is affected by the transverse position of the longitudinal <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> bulkhead. This information can be used to maximize the attained index for offshore vessels. To find out if the attained index changes proportionally for different ship sizes, the study determines if there is a correlation between the placement of the bulkhead and the attained index for four different vessel sizes. To reveal how the attained index develops for different arrangement configurations, the four vessels had two different arrangements. One arrangement had U-tanks, arrangement B, and the other arrangement had two longitudinal bulkheads in the double bottom without U-tanks, arrangement C. Since it is common practice to include U-tanks to maximize the attained index, the report also studies how much the attained index increases when U-tanks are introduced. The results of the attained index for the four vessels with different placements of the longitudinal <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> bulkhead, {{can be seen in the}} graph below. There is not a correlation of the attained index and the placement of the longitudinal bulkhead, for all vessels with different arrangement configurations. It was therefore not possible to develop a formula for the optimal placement of the bulkhead that applies for all vessel types and sizes. By analyzing the development of the attained index, as the longitudinal bulkhead was relocated, we found out which parameters that affected the attained index. As seen from the results, the attained index increases as the longitudinal bulkhead is moved towards the centerline for all vessels with U-tank arrangement. The development of the total attained index levels out when U-tank damages are critical for the survivability of the vessel. For vessels without U-tanks the development of the total attained index did not correspond for all vessels. The attained indexes increases for Vessel II, III and IV until damages to the <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> are critical for the survivability of these vessels. The common denominator for all vessels with U-tanks are that the total attained index decreases when damages to the <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> are critical for the survivability of the vessels. The total attained index for the two arrangement with and without U-tanks were compared. It was found that the effect of introducing <b>wing</b> <b>tanks</b> is approximately 7 %, when the longitudinal <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> bulkhead is placed at B/ 20. The effect of introducing U-tanks increases as the distance between the hull and the longitudinal <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> bulkhead increases. Is it possible to maximize the attained index by evaluating the placement of the longitudinal bulkhead? The effect of changing the position of the bulkhead changes according to the arrangement configuration. As different vessel types have different arrangement configurations it is difficult to predict the effect of relocating the longitudinal bulkhead. The flowchart below can be used by designers as a tool to help them maximize the attained index when placing the longitudinal <b>wing</b> <b>tank</b> bulkhead...|$|R
