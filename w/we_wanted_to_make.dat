5|$|We knew <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a dance record. But you know, there's so many {{different}} levels of dance music and even different categories of house music. So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to}} be loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E

[...] "Something that 20 or 30 years from now, parents could play for their kids and say, 'This is what I was listening to when I was your age. Check it out, it’s still fucking cool.' <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a record you could pass down. There’s a lot of music out now that doesn’t feel like that." ...|$|E

During the course of the episode he stated, [...] "Do <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the pill illegal? Yes. Do <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the IUD illegal? Yes.

500|$|Dreams {{differed}} to Evermore's earlier [...] "retro-sounding, riff-based pop-rock" [...] works, {{and instead}} contained a more [...] "spacious" [...] sound according to Jon. He said he drew inspiration and {{was influenced by}} Silverchair and Muse, as well as Pink Floyd. Jon {{also noted that the}} band initially wanted to create a concept album, but stated that [...] "we sort of had to tone it back a bit, because <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a double album". Soundgenerator.com reviewer Eleanor Goodman described Dreams as [...] "clear rather than grungy, soulful rather than angsty".|$|E
500|$|During production, Lumet {{felt that}} the {{finished}} film would be [...] "an absolutely unique experience that nobody has ever witnessed before." [...] When asked about any possible influence from MGM's popular 1939 film adaptation of The Wizard of Oz, Lumet stated that [...] "there {{was nothing to be}} gained from [...] other than to make certain we didn't use anything from it. They made a brilliant movie, and even though our concept is different – they're Kansas, we're New York; they're white, we're black, and the score and the books are totally different – <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that we never overlapped in any area." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{their last}} record, the highly {{successful}} Odyssey Number Five, the band {{agreed that they}} wanted to continue in their musical careers, but wanted to have more fun with it. They were no longer dole reliant, as they had been when they made their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears. Drummer Jon Coghill told The Sydney Morning Herald [...] "we wanted to have more fun and enjoy that we were a band, rather than chase what you're supposed to do", and guitarist Ian Haug said [...] "We all found that this is really important to us, but <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it more fun".|$|E

500|$|<b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a {{specific}} story about two people—Meg and Dom—not a video that was representative of all couples or all domestic violence situations. I'm {{not saying that}} all couples fight this way. I just want people {{just to be able}} to identify with the characters and recognize that they've seen relationships like this where two people are together that are completely wrong for each other and things spiral out of control.... Megan was the key to this video.... I'll tell you as a director the reason why [...] scenes in the video feel so real is because in the moment they were real.|$|E
500|$|Discussing Emma's {{style and}} costuming, Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich has explained: [...] "We {{wanted to make}} her look like everything’s so neat—perfectly ironed and tucked-in shirts with matching belts, shoes and pins. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her {{stand out from the}} other teachers. She’s always so happy and excited, so we wanted her outfits to represent that sunny disposition. In the pilot, we made her look much more teacher-y. Now we're having more fun with her character, keeping her bright and unusual. Quirky is the word. Emma’s also always in stacked Mary Janes or T-strap heels. It takes the outfit down from being too stylish or too sexy. It makes her look prim and almost old-fashioned." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} quickly {{recorded}} in Los Angeles {{over the course}} of two weeks. In an interview with The Guardian, when asked about the expectations of the album, Tyler replied [...] "I don't know. I have my doubts. Everybody's going on it and I just think, fuck, everybody might hate this shit. Everybody might go: 'What the fuck is this? We wanted this, we wanted that.' There we go. We made an album <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make.</b> If everybody hates it, OK. We have an album we like."

500|$|Drummer Will Champion later {{admitted}} that Coldplay did not rush {{to complete the}} album [...] "because the prospect of touring again was so daunting that we felt we should take our time, and also <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{sure that it was}} the best it could possibly be". According to him, the band had no deadline, which allowed them not to feel pressured into finishing something. Once a proper deadline was imposed onto the band, they became more productive than in previous sessions. At this juncture, the band had written [...] "about 14 or 15 songs". Martin added that the reason why they ended up late was that they [...] "...kept [...] finishing [...] the record until it was way too late... don't listen to it at the moment, because [...] just find something to go back and change." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{wanted to}} avoid repeating the {{protracted}} recording process of their previous album In Rainbows (2007). Singer Thom Yorke said the band had felt that [...] "if we are gonna carry on, {{we need to do}} it for a new set of reasons." [...] Cover artist Stanley Donwood said: [...] "In Rainbows was very much a definitive statement, and that isn't where the band are at the moment. Where they are now is more transitory ... this album shows where Radiohead are at the moment the record was released. The music is a continuing thing. And <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the album representative of that." [...] Multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood told Rolling Stone that the band had not wanted to [...] "pick up guitars and write chord sequences. We didn't want to sit {{in front of a computer}} either. We wanted a third thing, which involved playing and programming." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} reveal that Fitz was just imagining the {{presence}} of Simmons due to the injuries he sustained {{at the end of}} the first season, Tancharoen said, [...] "We didn’t want him to come out of that experience unscathed. He clearly suffered major trauma to his body. The lack of oxygen to his brain has to have consequences because that’s how it is in real life. We wanted there to be a price. Basically, he in his own Fitz way had professed his love for her, and then he came out of that. How do you come out of that experience without any physical damage, there would still be probably a change to their relationship because the feelings are out in the open. But, of course, being the people that we are, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it even more painful and compound it." ...|$|E

500|$|We {{explained}} to him what the song was about and he said, [...] "So, breaking out ... what about a boarding school?" [...] We love any movies to do with boarding schools – Cruel Intentions, The Craft. We were like [...] "Yes, yes!" [...] and we all brainstormed from there [...] We really had to push. A lot [...] We {{had a lot of}} control over making the music on this record and we wrote [...] "Hook Me Up" [...] so we would have the best idea of what the video would be. So it was [...] "Use our ideas. They're free" [...] Because the song is so different from the first record, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a video that was young and fun that kids could relate to. The video idea that was first proposed really was not for a young market. It was a lot older.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and was {{produced}} by American record producer Ron Aniello. When asked about his experience with making songs for No Name Face {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Wade said, [...] "DreamWorks has been amazing in letting us make the record. They're super-artist-friendly. They let us make our record the way <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it. It's the best label we could be on." [...] In an interview with MTV Radio, Wade explained the message behind [...] "Sick Cycle Carousel" [...] and said, [...] "It's one of those songs I'm really afraid to put an explanation to as far as what it's about for me personally. I don't want it to lose its mystery and mystique. Everyone interprets it differently. It's funny hearing people telling what's it's about to them because then I can go, 'Maybe that's what it's about.' It's got a weird mystique to me still." [...] It was released on March 25, 2002 by DreamWorks Records.|$|E
500|$|The writing staff {{often used}} their {{individual}} life experiences for inspirations {{to come up}} with the storylines of the series' episodes. For example, the episode [...] "Sailor Mouth", in which SpongeBob and Patrick learn profanity, was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's experience of getting in trouble as a child for using the f-word in front of his mother. Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life". The end of the episode, in which Mr. Krabs uses even more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was inspired [...] "by the fact that my [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself". The idea for the episode [...] "The Secret Box" [...] also came from one of Drymon's childhood experiences. Hillenburg explained, [...] "Drymon had a secret box [...] and started telling us about it. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> fun of him and use it." ...|$|E

500|$|On Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, [...] "Lovers in Japan" [...] {{transitions}} seamlessly into {{a second}} track entitled [...] "Reign of Love". In an interview with Q magazine, bassist Guy Berryman explained that the band could not {{make up their minds}} about the track listing, as they had discussed that they wanted to keep the album concise with a total of ten tracks and an intended length of under 42 minutes. Champion further stated, [...] "We just preferred to have less titles and more stuff. The album as a whole has got the most on it, but it’s the shortest. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it almost impossible for you to not listen to it all in one go." [...] In addition, vocalist Chris Martin revealed that the band had wanted to have a [...] "two-in-one" [...] song title, as American recording artist Justin Timberlake had done the same on his album FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006).|$|E
500|$|Some {{characters}} who previously appeared in War for Cybertron feature updated appearances and transformation schemes, or moving parts that animate regardless of player action, similar to breathing. The character Optimus Prime was redesigned for a [...] "more warrior-type feel", with more bulk {{added to his}} body mass. The weaponry in Fall of Cybertron was also modified and enhanced; the designers of the game put out a call {{to everyone in the}} studio for new weapon ideas. Matt Tieger of High Moon explained that in addition to new designs, each weapon could be upgraded, continuing, [...] "We really made a conscious choice to make every upgrade a significant improvement, so one upgrade might increase your firing speed by 75%. We could have made the system so {{that there were a lot}} of upgrades that each improved your guns a little bit, but <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> each upgrade feel like this giant thing. That way when players buy it they’re really going to feel the difference." ...|$|E
500|$|The group's {{voices are}} {{presented}} individually on the record. Savan Kotecha {{noted that the}} Backstreet Boys' late-’90s hits inspired the way he formulated One Direction's voices for the album. Composer Julian Bunetta, who worked on three of Take Me Home tracks, also tried to place emphasis on the sound of each member: [...] "The fans can tell the difference, but <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that when it came on the radio, the average person knew {{that it must be}} One Direction, because it’s five guys." [...] Likewise, Caramanica noted that the album's songs produced by Bunetta [...] "tend to start out with more breathing room, giving the guys a chance to show off vocally". The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, and commitment, in songs such as [...] "Little Things," [...] "Last First Kiss," [...] "Back For You," [...] and [...] "They Don't Know About Us." [...] Other tracks, like [...] "Heart Attack," [...] "Rock Me," [...] "I Would," [...] and [...] "Over Again," [...] have a more solemn tone, addressing jealousy and longing for past significant others.|$|E
