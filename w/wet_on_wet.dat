40|$|Object: Neurosurgical patties are textile pads {{used during}} most neurosurgical {{operations}} to protect tissues, manage the fluid environment, control hemostasis, and aid tissue manipulation. Recent research has suggested that, contrary to their aim, patties adhere to brain tissue and cause damage during removal. This study aimed to characterize and quantify {{the degree of}} and consequences resulting from adhesion between neurosurgical patties and brain tissue. Methods: Using a customized peel apparatus, the authors performed 90 ° peel tests on 5 patty products: Policot, Telfa, Americot, Delicot, and Ray-Cot (n = 247) from American Surgical Company. They tested 4 conditions: <b>wet</b> patty <b>on</b> glass (control), <b>wet</b> patty <b>on</b> <b>wet</b> brain peeled at 5 mm/sec (<b>wet),</b> dry patty <b>on</b> <b>wet</b> brain peeled at 5 mm/sec (dry), and <b>wet</b> patty <b>on</b> <b>wet</b> brain peeled at 20 mm/sec (speed). The interaction between patty and tissue was analyzed using peel-force traces and pre-peel histological analysis. Results: Adhesion strength differed between patty products (p < 0. 001) and conditions (p < 0. 001). Adhesion strength was greatest for Delicot patties under wet (2. 22 mN/mm) and dry (9. 88 mN/mm) conditions. For all patties, damage at the patty-tissue interface was proportional {{to the degree of}} fiber contact. When patties were irrigated, mechanical adhesion was reduced by up to 550 % compared with dry usage. Conclusions: For all patty products, mechanical (destructive) and liquid-mediated (nondestructive) adhesion caused damage to neural tissue. The greatest adhesion occurred with Delicot patties. To mitigate patty adhesion and neural tissue damage, surgeons should consider regular irrigation to be essential during neurosurgical procedures...|$|R

The German F.A.L. process used sulphurised linseed oil and was used for some years to paint United States Postal Service vans. With the development of quick-drying primers, it was used by Rank Xerox to paint parts for their copiers. The original clear on base system for automotive metallic finishes used an air drying base. This system, using a flash primer as well, was used for cycle finishes well before it was used for cars.|$|E

According to Watts, “When [...] [...] [...] you realize that you live in, that indeed you are this moment now, and no other, that apart from this there is no past and no future, you must relax and taste to the full, whether it be pleasure or pain.” Inspired by Watts, Swartz began practicing meditation.|$|E

After going through each color on the rotary belt, the final image is formed and a special coating is applied to each can to protect the can/colors from wear and tear. The completed cans are sent to the UV oven, that operate over 100 F and contains between six and eight 300 watt/inch UV lamps. Both inside and outside of the can are exposed to the light to ensure proper ink curing.|$|E

5000|$|Gallace paints intimately sized {{landscapes of}} houses and beaches devoid of people. She has been {{inspired}} by the rural New England landscape. Her process involves careful observation, omission, attention to brushstroke, color, and composition. Gallace describes the process of arriving at her streamlined representations as staring at something and breaking it down to what she finds most important. In Gallace's oil painting Cape Cod, Early September (2008) there is a simplified white cottage in the center surrounded by a pale blue sky and bright greenery. This painting {{was a part of}} the 2010 Whitney Biennial. She creates paintings with visible brushstrokes by painting <b>wet</b> <b>on</b> <b>wet</b> layers of oil on panel. Her technique flattens the perspective in the picture. She excludes details on the cottage, which allows viewers to make their own associations with the image. Gallace's work relates to early American Modernist painting, especially Edward Hopper's representations of small towns and Milton Avery's abstracted seascapes. Bruce Hainley selected Beach No. 2 (2013) as the [...] "Best of 2013" [...] in the December 2013 issue of Artforum. He wrote: [...] "Gallace ... makes some of the most intense paintings going. Luminous grays, glissandos of white, and auroral pinks and oranges dramatize her precise blues. In her “seascapes,” ... waves crash upon the shore and the horizons disappear—which is not a minor event for a painter who always considers grounding.While the artist’s photographs (one was reproduced as the show’s announcement card) document specific locales and buildings, some already dismantled by environmental or economic havoc, the paintings transmigrate soulfulness more than they do any topography. Gallace dissolves ongoing nattering about abstraction and representation, achieving the rare, staunch beauty of the quietly hard-won." ...|$|E

It is well known that the inorganic substrates in lake pigments determine in part the stability of the colorants towards the exposure to light [11, 13]. To date, no inorganic substrates other than Al-based have been reported for eosin paints in works by Van Gogh [14], and no studies have been published on the permanence of eosin red as precipitated on CaCO 3.|$|E
40|$|These {{etchings}} are {{the result}} of research of many aesthetic possibilities that are available to the contemporary printmaker. After working in the traditional printmaking methods for many years, this effort was a challenge and a search for a new imagery. Each new experiment seemed to lead to different methods of resolving the content and in several of the prints, a new form evolved, - an inter-media print with a three dimensional quality. The scrolls and pattern cut-outs added this new dimension to my prints. This series of etchings involve multiple plates and photo-etching. Some prints include collographs with the zinc and photo-etched plates. The techniques and imagery are the culmination of five semesters of work. The technique of photo-etching and learning by hours of research, took one semester. The final prints were selected after many months of printing the plates, using different colored inkings and sequences of printing, i. e., printing <b>wet</b> <b>on</b> <b>wet</b> ink, or drying the print before super-imposing the next plate. Some of these colored multiple plate etchings involve as many as six printings. The "Reflections" are of Hawaii and my impressions of how I feel and remember the beauty and tranquility of the islands. I remember the gentle trade winds that created enchanting patterns with the tropical growth. The interplay of light and shadow, the glistening rain drops after a sudden shower.

These are some of the impressions that influenced this series of prints. (See more in text. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{my current}} work I explore process and my fascination vvith human flesh {{by using the}} {{physical}} nature of paint as an equivalency for images and surfaces. I am fascinated vvith how nesh can have different quaitities. It can be brittle, rough, or smooth, it can form calluses and it can change color. Paint has these same quaUties. When I see peeling skin on my body, {{it reminds me of}} peeling paint and I find it hard to resist touching either surface. Ideas for images are generated by examining my nesh for cuts, wrinkles or boney protrusions or by looking at the detritus of the painting process found in my studio. Piles of unused paint, discarded utensils and nesh become elements of a landscape. I include images of teeth, horns, and beads as visual forms. I enjoy combining these images to invent surreal landscapes or intimate interior scenes. By inventing scenes, I am not tied to literal rendering and therefore have freedom to explore the painting process. I work intuitively placing specific colors, textures or images on the canvas. My choices are based on the needs of a painting and those choices either evolve to a finish or become buried by subsequent layers of paint. I often use a <b>wet</b> <b>on</b> <b>wet</b> technique, liberally applying a color into another wet color. I am trying to control chaos in this endeavor. The result is a painting that begins with an initial brush stroke and progresses to a finish based upon form, brush marks and coloration. Images and the physical nature of paint are equally important in my work. When I paint a reflection, the paint is smooth with elongated brushstrokes. When I paint an image of fatty flesh, the paint is thickly layered. The references in my paintings, however, are of equal or less importance than my intention of viewers understanding subjects in terms of the painting process...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to develop and validate a numerical model to study wetting during the impact of millimeter-size drops on a flat, smooth, solid substrate under isothermal or non-isothermal conditions. A finite-element modeling is used to simulate the transient fluid dynamics and heat transfer, considering Laplace forces on the liquid-gas boundary. The Lagrangian scheme allows a very precise tracking of the free surface deformation. In this work, the numerical model is extended to account for a temperature-dependent viscosity and for dynamic wetting at the contact line. Numerical results are presented to study {{the influence of the}} kinetic <b>wetting</b> parameter <b>on</b> the <b>wetting</b> incipience and behavior. Our results show the influence of <b>wetting</b> <b>on</b> the spreading and the transient drop shape. Also, numerical results are compared with high-speed visualization, for cases of isothermal and non-isothermal impact. Matching between simulations and high-speed visualization allows the determination {{of the value of the}} kinetic wetting parameter. Our main finding is that warm drops spread more than cold drops because of a reduction of viscous forces, and not because of an increase of wetting...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} quickly spread a liquid across a surface {{and form a}} film is {{fundamental}} for a diverse range of technological processes, including printing, painting and spraying. Here we show that liquid dielectrophoresis or electrowetting can produce <b>wetting</b> <b>on</b> normally non- <b>wetting</b> surfaces, without needing modification of the surface topography or chemistry. Additionally, superspreading can be achieved without needing surfactants in the liquid. Here we use a modified Hoffman-de Gennes law to predict three distinct spreading regimes: exponential approach to an equilibrium shape, spreading to complete wetting obeying a Tanner’s law-type relationship and superspreading towards a complete wetting film. We demonstrate quantitative experimental agreement with these predictions using dielectrophoresis-induced spreading of stripes of 1, 2 propylene glycol. Our findings show how the rate of spreading of a partial wetting system can be controlled using uniform and non-uniform electric fields and how to induce more rapid superspreading using voltage control...|$|R

40|$|In a {{multicolor}} {{offset press}} the process inks (kcmy) will be printed consecutively on the substrate from oneprinting unit to the other. The printing dots and elements in different process color will be printed either isolated, partly orcompletely overprinted {{depending on the}} halftoning. In a multicolor press the inks will be printed <b>wet</b> <b>on</b> <b>wet.</b> That meansthat {{in the area where}} process inks overlap each other one or more inks will be printed on another ink which is not dryenough. The adhesive power between the wet inks is different and less compared to the adhesive power between one inkprinted {{on the top of a}} less wet ink or even a completely dry ink. The adhesive power between the substrate and printed ink isalso different from the adhesive power of one ink on the top of another one. Depending on this adhesive power and the inks’inner cohesion power the thickness of the second printed ink varies. The thickness or amount of the second printed ink on thefirst one can be determined; its value is called trapping. The amount of the trapping will also be changed due to differentparameters such as ink temperature, dampening, printing speed etc. An important outcome is that the gray balance and thecolor appearance (secondary and tertiary colors) of the printed product also depend very much on the trapping’s amount. Thatshows how important it is to have an explicit value for the trapping. The amount of the second printed inks will bedetermined by trapping formulas. This value should be useful for the printer at the press. Unfortunately, the conventionaltrapping formulas are only useful for the “relative” comparison of trapping between two print products. All the conventionalformulas for trapping only deliver the amount of the second printed ink on the top of the first one in percent. This value for itsown (e. g. 63 %) is not really useful and meaningful for print machine operators. There are three different formulas fordetermining trapping. These are Preucil, Ritz, and Brunner. All of them are based on density only. The results of theseformulas are different to each other, especially the Brunner formula differs to the other ones. Here a method will beintroduced which is based on spectrometry and will complement the conventional formulas. Shahram Hauck is Printing process and quality manager at manroland, Germany</p...|$|E

40|$|The {{sedimentary}} overburden {{materials in}} the Australian coalfields vary from essentially uncemented rocks to cemented sandstones, including variations between these extremes. The uncemented spoil materials break down on excavation to extract coal and bulk up to a very loose density on end-dumping by haul truck in spoil piles. These loose materials then undergo three forms of settlement: due to their self-weight, "collapse" settlement <b>on</b> <b>wetting</b> by rainfall, and settlement due to degradation on exposure to weather, resulting in {{a substantial increase in}} density. Due to their lack of cementation, these spoil materials degrade rapidly on exposure to the weather, leading to significant settlement, followed by some reversal on re-agglomeration and swell. Collapse and degradation-induced settlements, both being associated with exposure to water, occur simultaneously <b>on</b> <b>wetting.</b> Wetting also causes a substantial reduction in the shear strength of the materials. The cemented spoil materials undergo more limited breakdown <b>on</b> excavation, dumping and <b>wetting.</b> Cemented spoil materials bulk up to a more limited degree on excavation, and settle less after dumping, than uncemented spoil materials. The paper characterises uncemented and cemented overburden materials excavated on open pit coal mining, and quantifies the laboratory compaction, shear strength, compressibility and degradation of scalped samples...|$|R
