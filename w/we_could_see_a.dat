500|$|This episode {{marked a}} change in the {{presentation}} of Black's [...] "flashback" [...] visions, a hallmark of the series. Previously they had been depicted with a series of rapid and vague images; director Wright felt that it would be beneficial to slow these down and linger on imagery for longer, [...] "so <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> little more of what was happening".|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognisable}} aspects of My Bloody Valentine's music is Shields' guitar sound, which [...] "use texture more than technique to create vivid soundscapes." [...] During the late 1980s, Shields began customising the tremolo systems for his Fender Jaguars and Jazzmasters; extending the tremolo arm and loosening it considerably, {{to allow him to}} manipulate the arm while strumming chords, which resulted in excessive pitch bending. Shields used a number of alternate and open tunings that together with his tremolo manipulation achieved [...] "a strange warping effect that makes the music wander in and out of focus", according to Rolling Stone. Shields' most notable effect is reverse digital reverb, sourced from a Yamaha SPX90 effects unit. Together with the tremolo manipulation and distortion, he created a technique known as [...] "glide guitar". Shields effects rig, which is composed largely of distortion, graphic equalizers and tone controls, consists of at least 30 effects pedals and is connected to a large amount of amplifiers, which are often set to maximum volume to increase sustain. During live performances, and in particular the closing song [...] "You Made Me Realise", My Bloody Valentine perform an interlude of noise and excessive feedback, known as [...] "the holocaust", which would last for half an hour and often reached 130db. Shields later remarked [...] "it was so loud it was like sensory deprivation. We just liked the fact that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> change in the audience at a certain point." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later {{they had}} 21 days of fair weather and calm seas {{after which they}} spotted land and, quite near the coast and visible from the ships, the first large {{populated}} center seen by Europeans in the Americas, with the first solidly built buildings. The Spaniards, who evoked the Muslims in all that was developed but not Christian, spoke of this first city they discovered in America as El gran Cairo, as they later were to refer to pyramids or other religious buildings as mezquitas, [...] "mosques". [...] "This land was as yet undiscovered...from the ships <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> large town, which appeared to lie six miles back from the coast, and as we had never seen on as large in Cuba or Hispaniola we named it the Great Cairo." ...|$|E
60|$|Through {{the thin}} veil of moonlit mist that slid over the {{hillside}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> army of rabbits bunched up, or hopping {{a few paces}} forward, feeding.|$|R
60|$|We {{had reached}} the heights that are so often cloud-wrapped for long periods. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing <b>a</b> few paces beyond our noses.|$|R
60|$|It was, for aught <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> Not <b>a</b> light showed anywhere; and to {{make things}} worse the moon had {{abandoned}} us. For one good hour we swept through chaos to the tuneless lamentations of Sheepshanks, who declared that his collar-bone was broken.|$|R
2500|$|... "When we {{got them}} {{surrounded}} the fight was over in one hour. There was so much dust we could not see much, but the Indians rode around and yelled the war-whoop and shot into the soldiers {{as fast as they}} could until they were all dead. One soldier was running away to the east but Crazy Horse saw him and jumped on his pony and went after him. He got him about half a mile from the place where the other soldiers were lying dead. The smoke was lifted so <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> little. We got off our horses and went and took the rings and money and watches from the soldiers. We took some clothes off too, and all the guns and pistols. We got seven hundred guns and pistols. Then we went back to the women and children and got them together that were not killed or hurt." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> {{long white}} ribbon of it, all dotted with carts and waggons coming from Croydon to Redhill, {{but there was}} no sign of the big red four-in-hand.|$|E
60|$|Less than {{a quarter}} of a mile away <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> large white motor launch coming round the corner. The deck was gay with awnings and bright dresses and parasols.|$|E
30|$|The {{length of}} one {{generation}} is determined {{according to the}} previous studies [8, 20]. We also conducted our experiments in which the length of generation was set to six, eight, or ten as well as four, but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>a</b> clear difference.|$|R
50|$|During {{the other}} periods no {{difference}} {{is visible in}} the crest but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> evolution of the crest at different times. The crest was printed in red on many magazines and printed matter before 1976 but after 1977 red and silver colours had been used for the crest. For {{the first time we}} come across the crest and the motto together in the magazine published in 1956. The significant feature found in this magazine is that the Sinhalese words are indicated {{on the top of the}} crest and the English wordings had been printed at the bottom. This becomes more important since this had been done by the Principals during a period under Methodist missionary management.|$|R
50|$|Vemulawada was {{the seat}} of Jain literature.The book Kavijanasrayam {{establishes}} the contributions of Jain Literature to Telugu. Chalukyas of Vemulavada, the local rulers, were great patrons of Kannada Jain literature. Along with Kannada, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that <b>an</b> attempt {{was made in the}} same direction for Telugu Jain literature.|$|R
60|$|An {{hour later}} {{we left the}} castle for Torchester. As we drove across the {{courtyard}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> pale, gaunt figure standing at the library window, silent and rigid. It was Francis, waiting.|$|E
60|$|Before us <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> {{continuous}} line of white-capped breakers, and so I led my little {{party to the}} right, hoping that we would soon see signs of {{an opening in the}} reef.|$|E
60|$|We had {{the river}} to ourselves, except that, far in the distance, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> fishing-punt, moored in mid-stream, on which three {{fishermen}} sat; and we skimmed over the water, and passed the wooded banks, and no one spoke.|$|E
60|$|Beyond {{the last}} cave we emerged into a desolate country {{of snow and}} ice, but found a well-marked trail leading north. The way was boulder-strewn, as had been that south of the barrier, so that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> but <b>a</b> short {{distance}} ahead of us at any time.|$|R
40|$|When {{we listen}} to music, we can {{distinguish}} individual instruments with relative ease. If a learning algorithm could do this automatically, it would have several applications: computers could transcribe music for us, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> take a recording and edit out the voice for karaoke, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> what <b>a</b> given piece might hav...|$|R

60|$|It was {{the faint}} sweep of a lady's dress. Nearer it grew, and nearer yet. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> figure steal from patch to patch of moonlight, and even hear the soft fall of sandalled feet. Another second and I saw the black {{silhouette}} {{of the old}} Zulu raise its arm in mute salute, and Nyleptha was before us.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is Mrs. Bernstone," [...] said Sholto. [...] "She is {{the only}} woman in the house. Wait here. I shall be back in a moment." [...] He hurried for the door, and knocked in his {{peculiar}} way. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> tall old woman admit him, and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him.|$|E
60|$|About two o'clock, {{after we}} had eaten and felt better, a white man appeared, {{carrying}} a white flag. Will Hamilton went out and talked to him, came back and talked with father {{and the rest of}} our men, and then went out to the stranger again. Farther back <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> man standing and looking on, whom we recognized as Lee.|$|E
60|$|The window {{had been}} burst in by {{a mass of}} garden mould, which flowed over the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our feet. Outside, the soil was banked high against the house. At {{the top of the}} window frame <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> uprooted drainpipe. The floor was {{littered}} with smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards the house was broken into, and since the daylight shone in there, it was evident the greater part of the house had collapsed. Contrasting vividly with this ruin was the neat dresser, stained in the fashion, pale green, and with a number of copper and tin vessels below it, the wallpaper imitating blue and white tiles, and a couple of coloured supplements fluttering from the walls above the kitchen range.|$|R
40|$|The terrible {{situations}} affecting {{many states}} and peoples {{around the world}} should be a key element that mobilizes the discussions in this forum … it is unfortunate <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>a</b> little more flexibility or humanity in these discussions and make IP a constructive tool. ” Delegate from Ecuador at the WIPO Development Agend...|$|R
60|$|By-and-by Irene {{came to the}} {{entrance}} of our cave, where by the light of her torch <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her exploring <b>a</b> shark that had been harpooned by David earlier in the day.|$|R
60|$|Round we swept, {{first one}} way then another, but we made no headway. In an hour's {{time we were}} no nearer land, and in the {{gathering}} twilight the coast line was dim and blurred. Here and there <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> few lights burning from the villages along the shore, and away northward the revolving light from Gorton headland shone out like a beacon.|$|E
6000|$|I felt caught, and {{a little}} embarrassed; but I laughed, {{and said it was}} a habit of mine when I {{was in a state of}} expenctancy. But he didn't seem quite satisfied; and from that time on he began to show uneasiness. Four times he walked me up the road to a point whence <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> long distance; and there he would stand, shading his eyes with his hand, and looking. Several times he said: ...|$|E
60|$|We landed, and {{of course}} we {{neglected}} to tie up the catamaran, which floated off down the river. Right cautiously we crept up a run-way. The Folk had all disappeared into their holes, though here and there <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> face peering out at us. There was no sign of Red-Eye. We were home again. And that night we slept in our own little cave high up on the cliff, though first we had to evict a couple of pugnacious youngsters who had taken possession.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} Islamic values, Mohammad Khatami {{encouraged}} film makers {{to extend the}} notions such as self-sacrifice, martyrdom, and revolutionary patience. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> such <b>a</b> notion in films in which most of those expression explained. When Khatami was the minister of culture believes that cinema in not the mosque and {{it is necessary to}} pay attention to entertaining aspects of cinema and not limiting it to religious aspect.|$|R
5000|$|A {{difference}} between technological revolution and technological {{change is not}} clearly defined. The technological change <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> as <b>an</b> introduction of an individual (single) new technology, while the technological revolution as {{a period in which}} more new technologies are adopted at the almost same time. These new technologies or technological changes are usually interconnected - as 3rd Kranzberg's law of technology says: [...] "Technology comes in packages, big and small." ...|$|R

60|$|We fled, hand in hand, {{down the}} bloody pavement, {{slipping}} and sliding, and making for the corner. Down the cross street <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> few soldiers still running. Nothing {{was happening to}} them. The way was clear. So we paused a moment and looked back. The mob came on slowly. It was busy arming itself with the rifles of the slain and killing the wounded. We saw {{the end of the}} young officer who had rescued us. He painfully lifted himself on his elbow and turned loose with his automatic pistol.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was more}} than fifty people waiting outside the iron fence that {{surrounded}} the house and grounds. There was generals and agitators and épergnes in gold-laced uniforms, and citizens in diamonds and Panama hats--all waiting to get an audience with the Royal Five-Card Draw. And {{in a kind of}} a summer-house in front of the mansion <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> burnt-sienna man eating breakfast out of gold dishes and taking his time. I judged that the crowd outside had come out for their morning orders and requests, and was afraid to intrude.|$|E
60|$|I heard him, as I stood breathless by his shoulder, with my pistol ready, pattering off prayers in a tremulous, rapid whisper; and I confess, horrid as {{the thought}} may seem, I despised him for {{thinking}} of supplications {{in a moment}} so critical and thrilling. In the meantime, Clara, who was dead white but still possessed her faculties, had displaced the barricade from the front door. Another moment, and she had pulled it open. Firelight and moonlight illuminated the links with confused and changeful lustre, and far away against the sky <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> long trail of glowing smoke.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile winter {{advanced}} with rapid strides. One night {{an intense}} frost set in {{and covered the}} entire lake, as far at least as <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see,</b> with <b>a</b> sheet of pure ice. It had set fast in a profound calm, and the surface was so smooth that every tree and bush on the outlying islets was reflected as if in water. Indeed, it could scarcely be told that the ice was not water except by going on it.|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{we showed}} that lung tissue showing {{infiltration}} after lung transplantation could exhibit lower MT {{in the presence of}} CAF compared to infiltrated lung tissue without CAF, thereby providing a potential tool to assess the origin of pulmonary infiltration after lung transplantation. Moreover, we demonstrated that MT is increased in infiltrated lung tissue compared to normal appearing well-ventilated lung after lung transplantation, which may be attributed to the increased content of protein-rich substrates. During acute rejection, a variety of inflammatory cells release different proteins (e.g. different interleukins). During CAF, a fibrotic change of the tissue caused by collagen can be observed. In this study, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> MTR increase in acute rejection and an MTR decrease in CAF. Since MT is sensitive to changes in the interaction of ‘free’ and ‘bound’ protons, one reason might be that the different proteins associated with acute reaction and CAF cause a different composition of the ‘free’ and ‘bound’ water pool, possibly because of differences in their ability to build a solvation shell. As a consequence, different MTRs can be seen.|$|R
60|$|Hunting {{conditions}} at Dude Creek had changed greatly to our benefit. The trappers had pulled up stakes {{and gone to}} some other section of the country. There was not a hunting party within fifteen miles of our camp. Leaves and acorns were all down; trails were soft and easy to travel; no dust rose on the southern slopes; the days were cold and bright; in every pocket and ravine there was water for the dogs; from any stand <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> into the shaggy thickets where before all <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was <b>a</b> blaze of color.|$|R
