25|$|In early 1863, Charles Heidsieck was {{approached}} by an American missionary with a packet of papers and {{a letter from the}} United States. The letter was from the brother of Heidsieck's former agent in New York. The man <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> of how his brother cheated Heidsieck out of his obligations and offered him a stack of deeds to land in Colorado as a means of repayment.|$|E
25|$|The Smiths dressed {{mainly in}} {{ordinary}} clothes– jeans and plain shirts– {{in keeping with}} the back-to-basics, guitar-and-drums style of the music. This contrasted with the exotic high-fashion image cultivated by New Romantic pop groups such as Spandau Ballet and Duran Duran and highlighted in magazines such as The Face and i-D. In 1986, when the Smiths performed on the British music programme The Old Grey Whistle Test, Morrissey wore a fake hearing-aid to support a hearing-impaired fan who <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> of using one, and also frequently wore thick-rimmed National Health Service-style glasses.|$|E

25|$|Having killed Acrisius, Perseus, who {{was next}} {{in line for the}} throne, gave the kingdom to Megapenthes ("great mourning") son of Proetus and took over Megapenthes' kingdom of Tiryns. The story is related in Pausanias, which gives as {{motivation}} for the swap that Perseus <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> to become king of Argos by inflicting death. In any case, early Greek literature reiterates that manslaughter, even involuntary, requires the exile of the slaughterer, expiation and ritual purification. The exchange might well have been a creative solution to a difficult problem; however, Megapenthes would have been required to avenge his father, which, in legend, he did, but only at the end of Perseus' long and successful reign.|$|E
25|$|Charles Haigh-Wood {{inherited}} his mother's property {{when she}} died, {{as well as}} the family home at 14 Albion Place, Walmersley Road, Bury, and he became a landlord, which allowed him to move his wife and Haigh-Wood to Hampstead, a fashionable part of north London. They settled into a house there at 3 Compayne Gardens around 1891. Haigh-Wood's brother, Maurice, was born there in 1896; he went on to train at Sandhurst and fought during the First World War. Although the family was clearly well-to-do, Seymour-Jones writes that Haigh-Wood <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> of her connection to Lancashire, perceived as working-class, and was left with a sense of inferiority that made her self-conscious and snobbish, especially when mixing with Eliot's aristocratic London friends.|$|E
25|$|Still, he {{knew that}} his mother was still alive and refused to attend the funeral at Corinth. To ease the tension, the {{messenger}} then said that Oedipus was, in fact, adopted. Jocasta, finally realizing that he was her son, begged him to stop his search for Laius' murderer. Oedipus misunderstood her motivation, thinking that she <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> of him because he might have been born of low birth. Jocasta in great distress went into the palace where she hanged herself. Oedipus sought verification of the messenger's story from the very same herdsman who was supposed to have left Oedipus to die as a baby. From the herdsman, Oedipus learned that the infant raised as the adopted son of Polybus and Merope was the son of Laius and Jocasta. Thus, Oedipus finally realized that the man he had killed so many years before, at the place where the three roads met, was his own father, King Laius, and that he had married his mother, Jocasta.|$|E

25|$|Word of {{the actions}} in Obligado spread around the continent. Most of the press, that so far had {{repeated}} the Montevidean libels, turned instead to support Rosas. Brazilian newspapers such as O Brado de Amazonas and O Sentinella da Monarchia referred to Rosas as a great South American hero. Francisco Antonio Pinto, former president of Chile, declared that the Chilean people <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> of the presence in Chile {{of a pair of}} newspapers that supported the Anglo-French cause. The president of Bolivia José Ballivián, who was so far against Rosas, instructed his diplomat Manuel Rodríguez to congratulate Rosas for the action of Obligado and protest with reason of the disloyal and unjust Anglo-French intervention in the Río de la Plata against the rights and interests of the Americas. José de San Martín wrote a supporting letter to Rosas and, despite his old age, offered his military assistance. He also {{wrote a letter to the}} British Morning Chronicle, explaining that a military occupation of Buenos Aires by Anglo-French forces would be nearly impossible.|$|E
25|$|C.J. Barnes, {{portrayed by}} David Spade (2004–2005), is Cate's nephew. He was {{once in the}} Army and claims to have studied aerial {{photography}} during the Gulf War, and to have received a Purple Heart in combat, which is in complete contrast with his generally childish attitude. He is {{a teacher at the}} school and often pursues women, albeit unsuccessfully. When C.J. first arrives, the family is initially surprised. He reveals to them that he <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> that he did not live up to be the person Paul had once said he would be and avoided them because of that. He lives along with his grandfather, Jim, in the basement (having previously lived in a van, which was burned by that same grandfather). He once dated Mrs. Krupp, his cousins' (Kerry and Bridget) math teacher, but he ended up cheating on her with his ex-girlfriend Cheryl. He once revealed that his first initial stands for Corey, but Rory said that was untrue. C.J. previously smoked marijuana heavily (and in fact used to smoke with Kyle's older brother), but at the start of his appearances, he claims not to have touched it in two years (he originally claimed it was five, though he relented after Jim expressed disbelief).|$|E

[...] Ingersoll described Yount's expertise as a hunter, including a story that he once killed 70 antelope in one day during a competition with another hunter, but that Yount <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> of the accomplishment because [...] "it went against his heart to kill so many innocent creatures just for the glory." ...|$|E

The players cooperated with police and the three were cleared of the allegations in November by police. Hunt later said he <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> and felt he let down his family, fans and the Broncos. However, in May 2009, the woman stated she had a few drinks with Hunt, went into a toilet cubicle, and [...] "after a few kisses, things went drastically wrong" [...] and that in a [...] "blink of an eye" [...] Boyd and Thaiday were also in the cubicle.|$|E

Goode interpreted Veidt's back-story to portray him with a German accent in private and an American one in public; Goode explained Veidt gave up his family's wealth and traveled the world, becoming a self-made man because he <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> of his parents' Nazi past, which in turn highlighted the themes of the American Dream and the character's duality. [...] Snyder said Goode [...] "fit the bill.... We were having a hard time casting , because we needed someone handsome, beautiful and sophisticated, and that's a tough combo." ...|$|E
500|$|Squall {{appears as}} a non-playable {{character}} in Kingdom Hearts. He wears a short leather jacket with red wings on the back (resembling the decorations on Rinoa's duster) and his Griever necklace. Squall takes the name Leon as an alias, because he <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> of not protecting those he loved from the Heartless when his home world (the Radiant Garden) was consumed by darkness. His role in Kingdom Hearts is to help guide the protagonist, Sora, in his battle (with other Final Fantasy characters) against the Heartless. Although Squall's appearance and age differ (he is 25 in Kingdom Hearts and 17 in Final Fantasy VIII), his personality remains the same. A memory-based version of Squall (as Leon) appears in [...] teaching gameplay in a tutorial. Leon's jacket later has a fur lining on its collar, which did {{not appear in the}} first Kingdom Hearts game. In this game, he works with his friends to restore their world. Squall also {{appears as a}}n opponent in Olympus Coliseum tournaments, often paired with other Final Fantasy characters. His virtual replica appears in Kingdom Hearts coded, where it meets Sora's virtual replica.|$|E

500|$|... "Possibly Maybe" [...] is {{a fusion}} of trip hop and chill-out music, which the San Francisco Chronicle review called [...] "a fragmented, poetic {{rumination}} on love's ups and downs". It has also been considered ambient dub. Björk {{has said that it}} was the first unhappy song she wrote, stating in 1997: [...] "That was very hard for me. [...] I <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> writing a song that was not giving hope". The slide guitar heard in the background of the song was originally intended to be its focal point, as Björk initially strived for an [...] "ambient country" [...] sound inspired by Chris Isaak's [...] "Wicked Game". The lyrics of [...] "Possibly Maybe" [...] document the various stages of the singer's ill-fated relationship with Stéphane Sednaoui. [...] "I Miss You" [...] was described in 1997 as an [...] "amalgam of styles, with electronic drums melding into African bongos mixed with jazzy horn playing". A house music number, its [...] "horn-infused Afro-Cuban strains [...] reflect the romantic whimsy of [...] lyrics". Björk wrote [...] "Cover Me", one of the quieter moments on the album, to her co-producer Nellee Hooper after he {{agreed to participate in the}} making of Post. She has said: [...] "I guess I was trying to make fun of myself, how dangerous I manage sometimes to make album making. And trying to lure him into it. But it is also a admiration thing from me to him". The album ends with the experimental [...] "Headphones", an ambient track. Featuring [...] "just-for-headphones studio tricks", it has been described as [...] "a chiming, somnolent dip into Björk's heavy-lidded pre-dream state". Its lyrics were written as a thank you to Graham Massey, who would make compilation cassettes for Björk. The singer also stated: [...] "But, of course, it is also a love letter to sound. The sound of sound. Resonances, frequencies, silences and such... a music-worship thing".|$|E
500|$|It was {{whispered in}} society that Rasputin had seduced {{not only the}} Tsarina but also the four Grand Duchesses. Rasputin had {{released}} ardent, though by all accounts completely innocent in nature, letters written by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses to him. They circulated throughout society, fueling rumors. Pornographic cartoons circulated depicting Rasputin having relations with the empress, with her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova nude in the background. Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time, much to Alexandra's displeasure, and Rasputin went {{on a pilgrimage to}} Palestine. Despite the rumors, the imperial family's association with Rasputin continued until Rasputin was murdered on December 17, 1916. [...] "Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy 'courses' for their age and their souls have much developed", Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on December 6, 1916, a few weeks before Rasputin was killed. However, as she grew older, Olga was less inclined to see Rasputin as her friend and was more aware of how his friendship with her parents affected the stability of her country. Olga wrote in her diary the day after the murder that she suspected Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, her first cousin once removed and the man she had at one time been expected to marry, was the murderer of [...] "Father Grigory." [...] Dmitri and Felix Yussupov, the husband of her first cousin Princess Irina of Russia, were among the murderers. In his memoirs, A. A. Mordvinov reported that the four grand duchesses appeared [...] "cold and visibly terribly upset" [...] by Rasputin's death and sat [...] "huddled up closely together" [...] on a sofa in one of their bedrooms on the night they received the news. Mordvinov reported that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed. Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on the reverse side by Olga, her sisters and mother. However, Olga was {{the only member of the}} family who did not attend Rasputin's funeral, according to the diary of her first cousin once removed Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia. According to the memoirs of Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, a woman who nursed with Olga during World War I, Olga said in February 1917, about a month after the murder, that while it might have been necessary for Rasputin to be killed, it should never have been done [...] "so terribly." [...] She <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> that the murderers were her relatives. After Olga and her sisters had been killed, the Bolsheviks found that each was wearing an amulet bearing Rasputin's image and a prayer around their necks.|$|E
