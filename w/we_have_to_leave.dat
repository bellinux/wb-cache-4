Now I think anyone who would try to {{separate}} those struggles, anyone who would say {{that in order to}} consolidate an anti-war movement, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> all of these other outlying issues out of the picture, is playing right {{into the hands of the}} enemy", she declared.|$|E
2500|$|In {{working around}} the other Marvel Netflix series, Buck {{described}} [...] "a fair amount of freedom", but [...] "because we are leading into The Defenders, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> our show in a very specific place with our character, because we do sort of plant seeds and stories that will then come to fruition in The Defenders. There does {{have to be a}} lot of cooperation between all the different" [...] series' showrunners for that aspect. [...] "But other than that," [...] he continued, [...] "we work distinctly by ourselves." [...] The season makes references to the events of The Avengers, the Hulk, Stark Industries, Jessica Jones, Daredevil, Luke Cage, and Seagate Prison, and mentions the Dogs of Hell biker gang, New York Bulletin editor-in-chief Mitchell Ellison and reporter Karen Page, Roxxon Oil and Midland Circle.

6000|$|... "Why!" [...] gasped Mother--"why--why, it's {{just like}} the picture--it is the picture--that we got when Lulu was born--that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> on the Cape." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you know, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> {{some one}} <b>to</b> {{look after the}} smack, an' I left Luke Trevor, as he said he'd prefer to come to evenin' service, an' Billy said he'd like to stay with Luke." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear sister, {{there is}} still a little difficulty, for <b>we</b> <b>had</b> all agreed that any girl we met should die at our hands, because it was {{for the sake of a}} girl that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> our kingdom.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{does your}} father think, John, {{that there will}} be trouble again in the spring? Shall <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> home again, as soon as the winter is past?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Three eggs," [...] said he. [...] "I think Dorothy has {{not been}} out here to-day. That is the {{beginning}} of your profits. You can take two of them; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> one for the nest-egg." ...|$|E
60|$|I wish I were in Switzerland, and I wish {{we could}} go to Florence; but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> these delights to you; there is no helping it. We all join in love to you and all the family.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> him behind, though Francie {{was ready}} to break her heart over it; but they said that nothing would do for Ivinghoe--after this second influenza--but a sea voyage, so she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make up her mind <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> him <b>to</b> my mother." ...|$|R
5000|$|After World War II, Tito {{declared}} that Yugoslavia <b>had</b> the right <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Trieste {{and all of}} Carinthia, including Austrian Carinthia, saying [...] "We have liberated Carinthia but international conditions were such that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it temporarily. Carinthia is ours and we shall fight for it".|$|R
5000|$|... “As you know, {{conflicting}} agendas dominated and {{so after}} a two years stalemate, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> I’m {{not the kind of}} person to stay just for money or for press. When you are witnessing the suffering of a people, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make the right decision at the right moment.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> without {{satisfaction}} {{you will}} go with Mr. Briarly, the detective," [...] cried Matt. [...] "Now {{you can take your}} choice. I am no longer your office boy, and you cannot twist me around your finger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep {{watch for}} the first show of fire, Master Grout, an' we'll see that you're posted {{as to what is}} bein' done outside. If <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> here, it'll be a good idee to draw off toward the rope-walk; there's no one near by that place, an' we may {{contrive}} to steer clear of the enemy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is well," [...] Archie said, [...] "for {{if in the}} end <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the castle, you, {{who have}} proved {{yourself}} so strong and brave, can, if needs be, take to the hills with me; {{but she could not}} support the fatigues of such a life.

5000|$|The non-album B-side [...] "There is Love" [...] {{features}} Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin on guitar. {{the song}} was left out because [...] "It didn't {{fit in with the}} final context of the album."

6000|$|... "But {{it is my}} home!" [...] she answered, looking hurt at my {{careless}} words. [...] "I {{was born}} there, and married there, and have always lived at Branscombe with my people until my husband got work in this place; then <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> home and come and live in this cottage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, in time," [...] was the prompt answer. [...] "I'm sorry <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the Sawhorse and the Red Wagon behind us, for they'd come {{in handy}} just now; but {{with the end of}} our journey in sight a tramp across these pretty green fields won't tire us a bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the first}} time," [...] she exclaimed, as she {{accepted}} them, [...] "I realise {{what it must}} be to be a millionaire! I have never seen such a box of chocolates in my life. Do you mind going over to the grocer's and letting him see me with you?" [...] she went on. [...] "It will be so good for our credit, and his {{is just one of the}} accounts <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> for a little time. Were you ever poor, Mr. Thain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear creature," [...] {{returned}} his companion, [...] "disguise is the spice of life. What is life, passionately exclaimed a French philosopher, without {{the pleasures of}} disguise? I don't say it's always good taste, and I know it's unprofessional; but what's the odds, downhearted drawing-master? It has to be. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> a false impression {{on the minds of}} many persons, and in particular on the mind of Mr. Gideon Forsyth--the young gentleman I know by sight--if he should have the bad taste to be at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then the father's pride again reasserted {{itself and}} he became angry. 'I tell you, you little fool, that {{it is out of}} the question. Why cannot you believe me? Has your mother spoken to you about your jewels? Get them packed up, so that you can carry them away in your hand if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> this suddenly. You are an idiot to think of that young man. As you say, I don't know that any of them are very good, but among them all he is about the worst. Go away and do as I bid you.' ...|$|E
60|$|Saturday, Jan. 9.—Strolled {{about all}} the forenoon. “What a time of blessed {{composure}} it has been,” said Mr. G. with a heavy sigh. The distant hills covered with snow, {{and the voice of}} the storm gradually swelling. Still the savage fury of the sea was yet some hours off, so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Biarritz without the spectacle of Atlantic rage at its fiercest.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see," [...] said Sam, [...] "this {{may turn}} out to be a small barren island, in which case <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it and trust to falling in with some vessel; or it may be {{inhabited}} by savages or pirates, in which case <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it from prudential motives, if they will allow us to do so. In any case, we won't begin by being extravagant with the provisions to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “To me,” she declared, “it’s all too terrible. I think <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the Pension Beaurepas. I shall {{go back to}} Madame Chamousset.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh blessed thought! {{that there}} is {{something}} of which death cannot rob us! That when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> this pleasant world, wife and child, home and business, and all that has grown up round us here on earth, till it has become like a part of ourselves, yet still we are not destitute. We can turn round on death and say--'Though I die, yet canst thou not take my righteousness from me!' Blessed thought! that we cannot do a good deed, not even give a cup of cold water in Christ's name, but what it shall rise again, like a guardian angel, to smooth our death-bed pillow, and make our bed for us in our sickness, and follow us into the next world, to bless us for ever and ever! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{will be an}} {{excellent}} arrangement," [...] Rupert said; [...] "the hope of getting the camels {{at the end of}} the journey will certainly be a great inducement to him to be faithful. I know that the Arabs think as much of these fast camels as we do of race-horses at home. And will you tell him too that if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> him and take the camels, I will see that they are left, to be given up to him on his arrival, at some place he may name. I think that it would be as well that he should feel that he will get the camels anyhow in addition to payment; otherwise the temptation to seize them might be so great that he might get rid of me on the first opportunity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} {{it as soon}} as I can find time," [...] he answered. [...] "We're going strong, but really there's very little credit due to me. It was Macheson's money and Macheson's idea. We've got an entire village now near Llandirog, and the whole {{population}} come from the prisons. Macheson and I used to attend the police-courts ourselves, hear all the cases, and form our own conclusions as to the prisoners. If we thought there was any hope for them, we made a note, met them when they came out, and offered them a job, on probation--in our village. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it to the chaplains now--I can't spare time to be always in London. We've two woollen mills, a saw-mill, and a bakery, besides all the shops, and nearly a thousand acres of well-farmed land. At first the people round were terribly shy of us, but that's all over now. Why, we have less trouble with the police in our village than any for miles around. We're paying our way, too." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dash|Ten {{was forced}} to drop off of the line-up of Warped Tour 2016 for uncited reasons. Corrin {{provided}} a quote to Rara's Farm, [...] "Unfortunately <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the tour unexpectedly after the Darien Center, NY show. We’re broken up about it, and hoping it's {{something that can be}} remedied. Kevin has been super supportive of us and let us know that we’re welcome to come back if and when the Army works it all out." ...|$|R
60|$|The cook {{came down}} just then and <b>we</b> <b>'ad</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> off talking, and I {{could see that}} Bill was so pleased at finding that the money 'adn't been thrown {{overboard}} that 'e was losing sight o' the difficulty o' getting at it. In a day or two, 'owever, 'e see it as plain as me and Jimmy did, and, as time went by, he got desprit, and frightened us both by 'anging about aft every chance 'e got.|$|R

6000|$|... "The English had {{practically}} no guns, {{they had no}} cavalry, they were inferior in numbers, and yet they beat us off. Their back was against a wall. You see, they knew that if they didn't do it {{there was nothing but}} a French prison before them. It is the same thing with us, lad; we don't want to fight--we want to get away if we can. But if we have got to fight we shall do it better than ever, for defeat would mean death; and if a soldier has got to die, he would a thousand times rather die by a musket-ball or a bayonet-thrust than by cold and hunger. There is one thing in our favour, the country we have to cross now is for the most part forest; so we shall have wood for our bivouacs, and if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the road it will cover our movements and give us a chance of making our way round the enemy. You will find that child a heavy burden, Jules. I do not blame you for bringing her along with you, but when things come to such a pass as this a man needs every ounce of his strength." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2013 it was {{reported}} during misty nights the lit glasshouses were a source of light pollution in the form [...] "a clearly visible night glow". The company were quoted [...] "For ventilation purposes <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> tiny gaps where the blinds meet. Even when the blinds are fully closed we estimate that approximately 2 per cent of area is uncovered." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hekmatyar {{had become}} prime {{minister}} ... But after chairing one cabinet meeting, Hekmatyar {{never returned to}} the capital, fearing, perhaps, a lynching by Kabulis infuriated over his role in destroying their city. Even his close aides were embarrassed. Hekmatyar spokesman Qutbuddin Helal was still setting up shop in the prime minister's palace when the city came under HezbIslami rocket fire late that month. [...] "We are here in Kabul and he is rocketing us. Now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> We can't do anything," [...] he told Massoud aides.|$|E
