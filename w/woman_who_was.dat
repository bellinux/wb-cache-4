40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} rate of early (first trimester) and late (second and third trimester) fetal loss in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> factor V Leiden homozygous. METHODS: Between December 1995 and February 2007, consecutive, {{unrelated}} white <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> factor V Leiden homozygous and <b>who</b> had <b>been</b> pregnant at least once were recruited from 10 French hemostasis units. For reasons of comparison, we included <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> factor V Leiden heterozygous {{and a group of}} noncarriers. The frequency of early and late fetal loss was assessed retrospectively and compared among the three groups. The effect of concomitant thrombophilic abnormalities was evaluated. The overall pregnancy outcome was reported. RESULTS: We analyzed 240 thromboprophylaxis-free pregnancies in 95 <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> factor V Leiden homozygous, 425 in 195 <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> factor V Leiden heterozygous, and 182 in 73 <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> noncarriers. The risk of late fetal loss <b>was</b> higher in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> homozygous (13 / 95, 13. 7 %) compared with those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> noncarriers (1 / 73, 1. 4 %, odds ratio 11. 41, 95 % confidence interval 1. 46 - 89. 46, P=. 002), whereas it <b>was</b> similar in <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> heterozygous and in noncarriers (6 / 195, 3. 1 % compared with 1 / 73, 1. 4 %, P=. 68). The percentage of women with early fetal loss was similar in the three groups (P=. 81). The live-birth rate was 80 %, 84 %, and 85 %, respectively, for <b>women</b> <b>who</b> where homozygous, heterozygous, and noncarriers (P=. 88). CONCLUSION: The factor V Leiden homozygous genotype increases the risk of late fetal loss. However, the overall likelihood of a positive outcome is high in our series of <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> homozygous. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III...|$|R

5|$|A minor {{incident}} in the K'iche' capital Q'umarkaj escalated to have important consequences.

The Kaqchikel demanded {{the execution of the}} K'iche' soldier while the K'iche' nobility demanded the punishment of the Kaqchikel bread seller. When the Kaqchikel lords refused to hand her over, the K'iche' lords sentenced Hun-Toh and Wuqu-Batz' to death against the wishes of the K'iche' king K'iq'ab. King K'iq'ab warned his Kaqchikel friends and advised them to flee Q'umarkaj. On the day 13 Iq' of the Kaqchikel calendar the four lords of the Kaqchikel led their people out of the K'iche' capital to found their own capital at Iximche.

5|$|Because {{remarriage}} {{was often}} {{thought to be}} a sacrilege—common belief (contrary to the Gospel – Luke 20:27–40 and Matthew 22:29–30) was that the sacrament of marriage extended beyond death—it was censured by the community. Thus the purpose of the Bal des Ardents was twofold: to entertain the court and to humiliate and rebuke Isabeau's lady-in-waiting—in an inherently pagan manner, which the Monk of St Denis seemed to dislike. A ritual burning on the wedding night of a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> remarrying had Christian origins as well, according to Veenstra. The Book of Tobit partly concerns a woman who had seven husbands murdered by the demon Asmodeus; she is eventually freed of the demon by the burning of the heart and liver of a fish.|$|E

There are apparently no contemporary references to Mrs. Hibbins as Bellingham's sister—Hawthorne's formation of this connection appears to be based on a footnote in James Savage's 1825 edition of John Winthrop's journals, and a genealogical tree of the Bellinghams published early in the 20th century does not mention her. However, Ann Hibbins' second husband, William Hibbins, was first married to Richard Bellingham's sister Hester but she died a year later and was buried in England. Bellingham also appears in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's The New England Tragedies, which fictionalizes events dealing with the Quakers.|$|E
