25|$|Because {{the filmmakers}} worked around the stars' schedules, {{the filming of}} the whole movie took several years. While so many A-list actors were on board, most were not {{completely}} aware of what other sketches would {{be included in the}} film, which features thirteen vignettes tied together by a story of a mad screenwriter (Quaid) pitching ideas to a movie producer (Kinnear). Penotti said many of the actors did not ask many questions about <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> going on in the film.|$|E
500|$|... "In most sci-fi epics, {{special effects}} {{substitute}} for story. [...] Here they seamlessly advance it," [...] observes Colin Covert of Star Tribune. Billboards {{were designed to}} balance a contemporary and futuristic appearance as well as easily visualizing <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> occurring {{in the rest of}} the world at the time, and cars were made to resemble modern ones at first glance, although a closer look made them seem unfamiliar. [...] Cuarón informed the art department that the film was the [...] "anti-Blade Runner", rejecting technologically advanced proposals and downplaying the science fiction elements of the 2027 setting. [...] The director focused on images reflecting the contemporary period.|$|E
500|$|Pickens {{prepared}} for this role by observing several of Kersh's real-life counterparts at the FBI's Los Angeles office, where, according to the actor, the most useful thing he learned was {{that most of the}} people at Kersh's level had been with the Bureau for twenty or twenty-five years and had not reached their positions in the FBI hierarchy by taking their work less than seriously or bucking the system without good reason. Robert Patrick, who portrayed John Doggett, recognized that his own character and Kersh were [...] "both military men – Air Force, Marines". Kersh was depicted as a United States Navy A-6 Intruder weapons officer during the Vietnam War. Both Patrick and director Kim Manners thought that, as Kersh, Pickens would [...] "come in each week and just nail his stuff" [...] regardless of <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> going on. Similarly, Frank Spotnitz thought that [...] "Robert Patrick and James Pickens really had a chemistry, loved playing scenes together. And I think their scenes together were some of the finest ones in the last two years of the show." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{an almost}} four-month delay, Oblivion went gold on March 2, 2006 and was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on March 21, 2006. Early rumors notwithstanding, Oblivion shipped on a single DVD-DL disc. One journalist voiced concern for the game's release date, as it was set in the same week as that of EA's [...] Hines dismissed the suggestion, saying, [...] "We {{tend to focus on}} what we can control and not worry about what we can't control. Given the level of interest and the number of pre-orders and so forth, we had a pretty good idea we'd be just fine no matter <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> happening that week." [...] Oblivion was the first RPG title to be released for Microsoft's Xbox 360 console. In addition to the standard release version, a Collector's Edition was released for both Windows and Xbox 360 which includes the 112-page Pocket Guide to the Empire, a bonus DVD containing concept art, renders, and an approximately 45-minute-long documentary on the making of Oblivion, and a coin replica of the in-game currency of Tamriel. Its suggested release price of US$69.99 brought back [...] "memories of game prices circa the Nintendo 64" [...] for one Kotaku commentator. Some suggested that the included coin be used to create a [...] "garish piece of jewelry".|$|E
2500|$|Producer Ken Nelson took a {{hands-off}} {{approach to}} producing Haggard. In the episode of American Masters dedicated to him, Haggard remembers: [...] "The producer I had at that time, Ken Nelson, was {{an exception to}} the rule. He called me 'Mr. Haggard' and I was a little twenty-four, twenty-five year old punk from Oildale... He gave me complete responsibility. I think if he'd jumped in and said, 'Oh, you can't do that,' it would've destroyed me." [...] In the documentary series Lost Highway, Nelson recalls, [...] "When I first started recording Merle, I became so enamored with his singing that I would forget <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> going on, and I suddenly realized, 'Wait a minute, there's musicians here you've got to worry about!' But his songs—he was a great writer." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Dave Malloy first {{performed}} on the Ars Nova stage in 2010, Artistic Director Jason Eagan, was blown away by his originality, range, and rigor, {{which led to a}} curiosity of <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> swirling around his head. Malloy became Ar Nova's 2012 Composer in Residence, giving Malloy access to all of Ars Nova's resources for one year- time, space, money, writing retreats, and a commission to create a new music-driven work to be produced at Ars Nova. When Dave proposed a musical based on Tolstoy's War and Peace Jason knew it was beyond Ars Nova's typical resources, but the project was too good to pass up. Jason knew that Ars Nova could push Dave farther than he had ever been before, and Dave could push Ars Nova farther than they had been before. October 2011 commenced the first weeklong workshop used to further develop the characters, story, music, and explore the idea of mixing a concert party and theater into one event. As the workshop ended Jason knew that this production would take more resources than they typically put into each production, and would take Ars Nova's entire production budget, a budget usually reserved for two productions, to accomplish this lofty goal. [...] In April of 2012, the production went through its second workshop to explore how the piece would live on its feet in the space.At the conclusion of the second workshop designer, Mimi Lin was brought on and made the decision to elevate the performers on runways that would swirl around the audience, allowing the performers to move through the space in full view. August 27, 2012, marked the date for the first rehearsal at Ars Nova. It was a month of creatively fueled blood, sweat and tears by a tremendous group of artists giving their all. The show officially opened at Ars Nova on October 16, 2012, {{and by the end of}} that week, the entire run was sold out. The extension sold out within one hour.|$|E
