5|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} by reviewers, who appreciated the {{improvements in the}} accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play <b>without</b> <b>spending</b> excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list {{was considered to be}} too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game.|$|E

25|$|The game uses several {{different}} level types and layouts. The game starts {{out in a}} front yard, and progresses to nighttime levels, where the gameplay is more challenging without any replenishing sun unless specific plants are used. Other levels feature the backyard, with a pool added. The final levels are nighttime pool levels (where fog fills the right half of the screen except when specific plants are used), a lightning storm level in pitch black (except when illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning), and rooftop levels (on the final level, the player must face a huge robot operated by a mad scientist {{who is also a}} zombie known as Dr. Zomboss). At set points throughout the game, the player is either warned through a letter by zombies or addressed by Crazy Dave to prepare for an ambush, where the game takes on a bowling style, using Wall-nuts to bowl down zombies, or a modified version of regular levels, where random plant types come up on a small selection, and the player can use the plants <b>without</b> <b>spending</b> sun.|$|E
500|$|Poor {{families}} {{are much more}} constrained in their economic ability to [...] "buy back" [...] lost time through the market. Instead of buying market substitutes, they try {{to meet their needs}} <b>without</b> <b>spending</b> money by taking care of children instead of hiring help, taking care of the sick instead of taking them to the hospital, and making food from scratch instead of buying pre-made food. The way that poor families deal with the time debt is for the main caretaker to intensify the time that they spend working, by doing multiple jobs at once instead of doing one job at a time. When people increase the intensity of their work to compensate for their lack of time to finish everything that needs to get done, called work intensity, many health problems occur.|$|E
500|$|Musgrave commented, [...] "the art style does {{sometimes}} {{hinder the}} gameplay", and Willington {{was critical of}} the story mode, which he said had a [...] "weak plot" [...] and lacked character development. The Download.com staff also noted some lags and software bugs, while Musgrave and Allen stated the controls sometimes had problems recognizing swipes. Squires commented that a problem {{of the game is}} its level cap limit when the player is using only one character. However, according to Musgrave, the game's energy system was [...] "the biggest point of controversy"; he, Willington, Allen, and Mike Fahey of Kotaku criticized it. In opposition, McElroy said the energy system is a [...] "microtransaction hook" [...] that is easily surmountable <b>without</b> <b>spending</b> any real money, and Squires affirmed that because of the duration of a run it [...] "ends up feeling a lot fairer in practice than it sounds on paper".|$|E

500|$|Once {{a thermal}} is encountered, the pilot can fly in tight circles {{to keep the}} glider within the thermal, so gaining {{altitude}} before flying towards the destination or to the next thermal. This is known as [...] "thermalling". Alternatively, glider pilots on cross-country flights may choose to 'dolphin'. This is when the pilot merely slows down in rising air, and then speeds up again in the non-rising air, thus following an undulating flight path. Dolphining allows the pilot to minimize the loss of height over great distances <b>without</b> <b>spending</b> time turning. Climb rates depend on conditions, but rates of several meters per second are common and can be maximized by gliders equipped with flaps. Thermals can also be formed in a line usually because of the wind or the terrain, creating cloud streets. These can allow the pilot to fly straight while climbing in continuous lift.|$|E
500|$|After meeting George Lamb on {{a holiday}} in Ibiza, Allen made him her manager. Lamb later {{introduced}} the singer to production duo Future Cut, {{with whom she}} had written and produced demos, which were sent to various labels. In 2005, Allen was signed to Regal Records, who gave her £25,000 to produce an album. The singer considered it to be a [...] "small development idea", as they were also unable to provide much support for it due to their preoccupation with other releases. Taking advice from Lady Sovereign, the singer created an account on MySpace and began posting demo songs in November 2005. By March 2006, they attracted thousands of listeners, and 500 limited edition 7" [...] vinyl singles of one of the demos, a song titled [...] "LDN", were rush-released and sold for as much as £40. Allen also produced two mixtapes to promote her work. As she accumulated tens of thousands of MySpace friends, The Observer Music Monthly took interest. Few people outside of her label's A department had heard of Allen, so the label was slow in responding to publications who wanted to report about her. Her label wasn't pleased with the sound of the demos, so they assigned the singer to [...] "more mainstream producers and top-line writers". After that, they finally approved some of her songs, being confident of their inclusion on the album. [...] "Smile" [...] was among the chosen ones, that Allen claimed she was happy with. It was the first song she had ever written, claiming:When I set out to do this I knew I wanted to make songs that sounded a) up to date and now and b) really organic. Because you can't get really good players <b>without</b> <b>spending</b> loads of money these days, the only other option is to sample. The first song I ever wrote was 'Smile'. We just went through about seven or eight sample lyrics, found a beat, put it all in... Then when it comes to writing lyrics I write... like a rapper would, I suppose, with absolutely no melody involved whatsoever, I'm just getting my flow sorted. Then I write the whole text of the song and then ad lib the melody into the microphone. It's not terribly clever! ...|$|E

Some have observed that with some of the newer expansions, with the need for strong Legendary cards to construct good decks around, one may need to spend about $50 to $100 to get the right cards to make a successful decks in the Standard format, belying the game's free-to-play nature.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} many {{historical}} disputes regarding the combination of money's functions, some arguing that they need more separation and that a single unit is insufficient {{to deal with them}} all. One of these arguments is that the role of money as a medium of exchange is in conflict with its role as a store of value: its role as a store of value requires holding it <b>without</b> <b>spending,</b> whereas its role as a medium of exchange requires it to circulate. [...] Others argue that storing of value is just deferral of the exchange, but does not diminish the fact that money is a medium of exchange that can be transported both across space and time. The term [...] "financial capital" [...] is a more general and inclusive term for all liquid instruments, {{whether or not they are}} a uniformly recognized tender.|$|E

2500|$|A single {{house could}} have several {{interested}} parties, {{with the ground}} landlord or freeholder, being unaware {{of the actions of}} his or her leaseholder. Leaseholders would frequently lease out various parts of a house, while the weekly tenants sublet to lodgers, who sometimes sublet to other lodgers. Per cubic foot the rents in the Old Nichol were four to ten times higher than those of the finer streets of the London West End, averaging between 2s3d to 3s for a single room and around 7s6d for a three-room lodging. This provided high profits to speculative property dealers, which a housing reform campaigner of the time called [...] "the vampyres of the poor". [...] Many of the properties in the Old Nichol were held on fast-expiring leases, and leaseholders thought to {{get to the end of}} the lease <b>without</b> <b>spending</b> any money on maintenance or improvements.|$|E

2500|$|With {{no prior}} {{experience}} working with the Source engine, Wreden relied heavily on information and help from wikis and forums on the Source Development Kit, teaching himself the fundamentals. Outside of Kevan Brighting's voicework, The Stanley Parable was all Wreden's work. Wreden used an open audition process to find a narrator, and found Brighting's submission to be ideal for the game. Brighting had provided his voice {{in a single pass}} for Wreden. Wreden wanted to keep the game short so as to allow players to experience all the endings <b>without</b> <b>spending</b> an excessive amount of time replaying the game. The shortness of the game would also allow him to introduce ridiculous and nonsense endings, such as [...] "and then everything was happy!", that would otherwise not insult the player as a poor reward for a completing a long game. Most of the ideas he had envisioned for the game were included though some had to be dropped due to his inability {{to figure out how to}} work with them within the Source engine. In one case, Wreden wanted to include a point where the player would have to press buttons as the narration and screen prompts would have said, but could not figure out how to bind keyboard input to do this, but left the element in there as a [...] "broken" [...] puzzle; he later was praised for this, as to players, this gave the impression of lacking control during the stage of narration. Despite the success of completing the game, Wreden considered the overall project [...] "grueling" [...] and stifling his career ambition, noting that his efforts became more intense once he started learning of other players' interest in the title.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the general}} election, the Democratic Party nominee was Terry Goddard, {{who had served}} as the mayor of Phoenix until February of that year. Goddard is also the son of former Arizona Governor Samuel Pearson Goddard Jr. During the campaign, Goddard had {{attempted}} to cast doubt on Symington {{in the minds of}} voters by stating that the former businessman could face indictment for his business activities. In response, Symington charged that Goddard had violated the state's campaign finance law by [...] "accepting a law-firm salary while campaigning, <b>without</b> <b>spending</b> the stipulated hours on legal work." [...] One of Symington's campaign promises included a state budget cut of 6%, except for programs related to education and the poor. On election day in November 1990, the presence of several write-in candidates resulted in Symington and Goddard being virtually tied, with Symington ahead by only 4,300 votes. Prior to the election, Arizona had adopted runoff voting in general elections if no candidate received 50% of the vote. This came after the controversial Evan Mecham had been elected governor in 1986 with only 40% of the vote. As a result, a runoff was scheduled for February 26, 1991. Both candidates spent a cumulative total of approximately $5 million in the primary, general and runoff campaigns. Shortly before the runoff occurred, while in Washington, D.C. for a fundraiser, Symington was called before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee by Democratic Senator Howard Metzenbaum, a move that was seen as politically motivated. During the hearing, U.S. Senator Bob Dole accused the Democrats of a political [...] "sneak attack" [...] on Symington, a line which was later used in a Symington campaign commercial. The commercial also depicted Goddard behind bars, as the ad's narrator asks: [...] "How can anyone trust Terry Goddard, when the fact is he's broken the law?" [...] Symington would go on to win the runoff with 52% of the vote. After the extended campaign, Arizona returned to plurality voting for all subsequent gubernatorial elections, making the 1990 gubernatorial election the only runoff election in Arizona's history.|$|E
