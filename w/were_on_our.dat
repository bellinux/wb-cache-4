The production received a 25% tax credit for filming in the state. Berg shot Lone Survivor with creative autonomy as Universal did not fully oversee the film's production. [...] "Not having the studio there every day ... I respect Universal and get along great with them, but we <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> own completely, and in many ways, it was a more autonomous experience".|$|E
500|$|On 8 December, the Austro-Hungarians {{fell back}} against Užice and Valjevo. The Serbs {{anticipated}} that their opponents would entrench themselves {{and attempt to}} block the Serbian Army's advance, but the Austro-Hungarians had failed to construct any defensive networks and, as such, were {{in no position to}} block the Serbian offensive. The Austro-Hungarians had ensured that Valjevo's defenses were fortified and had laid down artillery plans for the town's defense, but their lack of prior preparation meant that the hills surrounding the town were devoid of any significant defensive positions. The Serbs exploited this weakness by manoeuvring around the hills and encircling the Austro-Hungarians, suffering minimal casualties. The Serbian 3rd Army then broke through the defenses of the 6th Army at Mount Suvobor and stormed Valjevo. In Niš, the Bulgarian ambassador to Serbia reported: [...] "The most improbable news from the battleground, sweet to the Serb ear, has been going around since this morning." [...] He wrote that, in the last three to four days, the Serbian Army had captured one Austro-Hungarian General, 49 officers and more than 20,000 troops, as well as 40 cannon and [...] "huge quantities of war matériel". By 9 December, the Austro-Hungarian counter-offensive around Belgrade lost its momentum and the Austro-Hungarians began to retreat back towards the city centre. One Austro-Hungarian soldier wrote: [...] "We could not have imagined that the Serbs <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> heels, after all we had recently been victorious." [...] On 10 December, the Serbian Army captured the lower reaches of the Drina, forcing the majority of surviving Austro-Hungarian troops to flee across the river. They did not stop until they had crossed the Sava and the Danube and entered the Banat. Very few Austro-Hungarian soldiers made it back into Bosnia.|$|E

I want to make that kind of intensity for myself. A couple of years later I was at CBGB's doing my best Noddy Holder." [...] Steve Jones of Sex Pistols stated [...] "Slade never compromised. We always had the feeling that they <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> side. I don't know but I think we were right." [...] NME commented on Slade's legacy in a review of a greatest hits album, [...] "They embodied the glorious absurdity of the greatest pop, in the sideburns, the mirrored top hat and Dave Hill's pudding bowl haircut. As such they were the simplest, most effective possible, riposte to prog rock's bloated pretensions and pseudo-intellect." [...] In 1981, Adam and the Ants' lead guitarist and co-songwriter Marco Pirroni stated that he was greatly influenced by the first gig he ever attended which was Slade at Wembley Pool in 1973.|$|E

2500|$|The damage {{occurred}} {{when she was}} flying a mission over Baghdad on April 7, 2003. [...] "We did our job with the guys there on the ground, and as we <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> way out is when I felt the jet get hit. It was pretty obvious — it was loud... I lost all hydraulics instantaneously, and the jet rolled left and pointed toward the ground, which was an uncomfortable feeling over Baghdad. It didn't respond to any of my control inputs." [...] She tried several procedures to get the aircraft under control, none of which worked; last, she put the plane into manual reversion, meaning she was flying the aircraft without hydraulics. The aircraft immediately responded. [...] "The jet started climbing away from the ground, which was a good feeling {{because there was no}} way I wanted to eject over Baghdad." [...] With some technical advice from her flight leader, Lieutenant Colonel Turner, she flew the injured plane for an hour back to the air base. [...] "The jet was performing exceptionally well. I had {{no doubt in my mind}} I was going to land that airplane." [...] Landing was tricky: [...] "When you lose all the hydraulics, you don't have speed brakes, you don't have brakes, and you don't have steering." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oughton and 75 other Weatherwomen {{drove to}} Pittsburgh on September 3, 1969, after {{attending}} a caucus in Cleveland {{to take part}} in what the Weathermen Group called a practice run of the [...] "Days of Rage". [...] On the morning of September 4, 20 Weatherwomen entered the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) office and held the office workers captive until the Weatherwomen had run off copies of a leaflet to be handed out to student sympathizers. One of the Weatherwomen told Miss Dodd, who worked in the AFSC office, [...] "We thought until now you <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> side. Now we know you are a member of the enemy." [...] A short time later, all 75 Weatherwomen appeared at South Hills High School in Pittsburgh to participate in a [...] "jailbreak". The women spray painted anti-war slogans, [...] "Ho lives" [...] and [...] "Free Huey", on the school's main entrance doors, and handed out leaflets, urging high school students to [...] "bring the war home," [...] and asking students to leave the school campus. [...] Some Weatherwomen made speeches in the school's playground about racism, imperialism, and the SDS national action plans. Oughton was able to escape from the Pittsburgh police, but 26 others, including Cathy Wilkerson and Jane Spielman, were arrested at the school. The students at the high school had no idea who the Weatherwomen were, or even why the women chose their school.|$|E
