At Dhammayut monasteries (and some Maha Nikaya forest monasteries, including Wat Pah Nanachat), monks will eat just one meal per day. For young children it is customary for the parent to help them scoop food into monks bowls.|$|E
25|$|High-flyers {{can perform}} {{springboard}} diving attacks to opponents {{inside or outside}} of the ring. Instead of countering or side-stepping attacks, they perform an evasive roll. Their special ability is a possum pin. After recovering from being knocked down, a high-flyer can remain on the ground. If the attacker attempts a grapple move, the defending wrestler <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> a pin attempt which is difficult to break out of. However, if the opponent attempts a strike, then the pin attempt is lost.|$|E
25|$|On May 21, 2014, JPMorgan Chase {{announced}} that it was injecting $100 million over five years into Detroit's economy, providing development funding for a variety of projects that would increase employment. It is the largest commitment made to any one city by the nation's biggest bank. Of the $100 million, $50 million will go toward development projects, $25 million will go toward city blight removal, $12.5 million <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> job training, $7 million <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> small businesses in the city, and $5.5 million will go toward the M-1 light rail project (Qline). On May 19, 2015, JPMorgan Chase {{announced that}} it has invested $32 million for two redevelopment projects in the city's Capitol Park district, the Capitol Park Lofts (the former Capitol Park Building) and the Detroit Savings Bank building at 1212 Griswold. Those investments are separate from Chase's five-year, $100-million commitment. On May 10, 2017, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. announced a $50 million increase in the $100 million investment the firm committed to economic development and neighborhood stabilization in Detroit by 2019. Half of the $150 million will be grants and the other half is going to toward a variety of loan funds for small business growth, mixed-use real estate development and residential housing projects.|$|E

25|$|A {{difficult}} shot {{in tennis}} is {{the return of}} an attempted lob over the backhand side of a player. When the contact point {{is higher than the}} reach of a two-handed backhand, most players will try to execute a high slice (under the ball or sideways). Fewer players attempt the backhand sky-hook or smash. Rarely, a player <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> a high topspin backhand, while themselves in the air. A successful execution of any of these alternatives requires balance and timing, with less margin of error than the lower contact point backhands, since this shot is a break in the regular pattern of play.|$|E
25|$|Checking the cervix by the Papanicolaou test, or Pap smear, for {{cervical}} cancer has {{been credited with}} dramatically {{reducing the number of}} cases of and mortality from {{cervical cancer}} in developed countries. Pap smear screening every 3–5 years with appropriate follow-up can reduce cervical cancer incidence up to 80%. Abnormal results may suggest the presence of precancerous changes, allowing examination and possible preventive treatment. The treatment of low-grade lesions may adversely affect subsequent fertility and pregnancy. Personal invitations encouraging women to get screened are effective at increasing the likelihood they will do so. Educational materials also help increase the likelihood women <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> screening, but they are not as effective as invitations.|$|E

And we still had Leonard Nimoy’s presence there, even though he [...] was dead. So they came up with the bizarre idea of putting his presence into Anna Torv, which is outrageous. Outrageous, and yet we did it, and {{had a lot of fun}} doing it. Then we had to get him out of it. Because Leonard’s officially retired, so we did the animation to use his voice." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey, taken from her eleventh studio album, E=MC² (2008). It was written by Carey, Aldrin Davis, Crystal Johnson and Clifford Harris, and produced by the former two. As the song's hook and instrumentation is derived from sampling DeBarge's [...] "Stay with Me", Mark DeBarge and Etterlene Jordan also share songwriting credits. [...] "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" [...] was released as the album's third single in the United States, Australasia and select European countries on July 1, 2008. Drawing influence from pop, soul and R music genres, and featuring a piano and keyboard-driven melody, the song's lyrics demonstrate the lengths the protagonist <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> her lover, and how she will be 'lovin' him long time'.|$|E
500|$|The third Test, {{which began}} at Adelaide on 13 January 1933, has been characterised by Wisden as [...] "probably the most {{unpleasant}} [...] ever played". Bill Woodfull, the Australian captain, was struck over the heart by a ball from Larwood and was incapacitated for several minutes. Larwood had been bowling to an orthodox field; on Woodfull's resumption, to the crowd's amazed hostility, Jardine {{switched to the}} leg theory attack. [...] "What could be clearer", wrote Swanton, [...] "than that {{at the root of}} these leg-theory tactics was the threat of physical injury?". Larwood then knocked Woodfull's bat from his hands, bringing further demonstrations from the crowd. Later in the innings a Larwood delivery struck Bert Oldfield on the head, causing his retirement from the match. The crowd's reaction was such that Larwood thought a full-scale invasion of the pitch might follow: [...] "If one man jumps the fence the whole mob <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> us".|$|E
2500|$|In {{his review}} of the film {{in what was then}} a leading {{national}} magazine (Time magazine), Whittaker Chambers wrote of The Grapes of Wrath: [...] It will be a red rag to bull-mad Californians {{who may or may not}} boycott it. Others, who were merely annoyed at the exaggerations, propaganda and phony pathos of John Steinbeck's best selling novel, may just stay away. Pinkos who did not bat an eye when the Soviet Government exterminated 3,000,000 peasants by famine, <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> a good cry over the hardships of the Okies. But people who go to pictures for the sake of seeing pictures will see a great one. [...] For The Grapes of Wrath is possibly the best picture ever made from a so-so book. It is certainly the best picture Darryl F. Zanuck has produced or Nunnally Johnson scripted. It would be the best John Ford had directed if he had not already made The Informer.|$|E

2500|$|Parker's {{process for}} making music is [...] "I'll have a sudden, {{spontaneous}} {{vision of a}} song, have all the parts mapped out in mind, and {{do my best to}} record it as quick as I can. I'll find my eight-track and do a quick demo of just the riff, or a verse or a chorus. The song <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> like 30 seconds. I'll have a whole bunch of them [...] and then I'll just choose which ones to make into full songs." [...] For Parker, the music comes before the lyrics, [...] "I usually write the lyrics after the melody and its timing have been decided. But the words have to be meaningful. I try to synchronise certain words with the best parts of the melody, but it can be really difficult and does my head in. I like to keep the meaning pretty open and ambiguous so that it's not just me that gets something out of the lyrics. I usually write lyrics from a persona rather than tell a specific story." [...] Parker also said [...] "Usually I am sufficiently motivated to think of new songs everyday, but I usually forget them. I seem to get an emotional kick out of sensing feelings of general desperation or hopelessness, whether it's me or someone near me or someone in a movie or anything. It's really difficult to sit down and force yourself to write a song, and that forced nature usually comes out in the song so I just have to wait until they come to me." ...|$|E
