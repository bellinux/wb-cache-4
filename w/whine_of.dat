25|$|The head is {{specialized}} {{for receiving}} sensory information and for feeding. It has {{eyes and a}} pair of long, many-segmented antennae. The antennae are important for detecting host odors, as well as odors of breeding sites where females lay eggs. In all mosquito species, the antennae of the males in comparison to the females are noticeably bushier and contain auditory receptors to detect the characteristic <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> the females.|$|E
25|$|The {{males are}} roughly 20% {{smaller than the}} females, but they are morphologically very similar. However, as in all {{mosquito}} species, the antennae of the males {{in comparison to the}} females are noticeably bushier and contain auditory receptors to detect the characteristic <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> the female. The maxillary palps of the males are also longer than their proboscis, whereas the females’ maxillary palps are much shorter. (This is typical for the males of the Culicinae.) In addition, the tarsus of the hind legs of the males is more silvery. Tarsomere IV is roughly 75% silver in the males whereas the females’ is only about 60% silver.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Larkin made audio {{recordings}} (in studio conditions) of each of his three mature collections, and separate recordings of [...] groups of poems {{for a number of}} audio anthologies, he somehow gained a reputation as a poet who was reluctant to make recordings in which he read his own work. While Larkin did express a dislike of the sound of his own voice ("I come from Coventry, between the sloppiness of Leicester and the <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> Birmingham, you know—and sometimes it comes out"), the evidence indicates that this influenced more his preference not to give public readings of his own work, than his willingness to make audio recordings of his poems.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} meeting with Capitol Pictures boss Jack Lipnick, Barton {{explains}} that he chose the Earle because he wants lodging that is (as Lipnick says) [...] "less Hollywood". Lipnick promises that his only concern is Barton's writing ability and assigns his new employee to a wrestling film. Back in his room, however, Barton is unable to write. He is distracted by sounds coming from the room next door, and he phones the front desk to complain. His neighbor, Charlie Meadows, {{is the source of the}} noise and visits Barton to apologize, insisting on sharing some alcohol from a hip flask to make amends. As they talk, Barton proclaims his affection for [...] "the common man", and Charlie describes his life as an insurance salesman. Later, Barton falls asleep, but is awakened by the incessant <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> a mosquito.|$|E
2500|$|Some Ukrainian-Canadian {{members of}} the riding {{association}} objected to the nomination, citing a perceived anti-Ukrainian sentiment in Blood and Belonging, where Ignatieff said: [...] "I have reasons to take the Ukraine seriously indeed. But, to be honest, I'm having trouble. Ukrainian independence conjures up images of peasants in embroidered shirts, the nasal <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> ethnic instruments, phony Cossacks in cloaks and boots..." ...|$|E
60|$|Smoke was {{permitted}} to question the witnesses, {{and he was in}} the middle of the cross-examination of Harding when from without came the <b>whining</b> <b>of</b> dogs in harness, and the grind and churn of sled-runners. Somebody near the door peeped out.|$|R
40|$|The ocurrence of {{nonlinear}} vocal {{phenomena in}} frustration <b>whines</b> <b>of</b> the Domestic Dog (Canis familiaris) We analyzed quantitatively {{the occurrence of}} nonlinear vocal phenomena in <b>whines</b> <b>of</b> 9 Domestic Dogs of 6 breeds. The dogs produced whines {{in response to a}} frustration-provoking situation (impossibility to perform the desired action), designed with their owners. The whines could consist two fundamental frequencies – the low (f 0) and the high (g 0), that could occur both singly as separate vocalizations and together within the same vocalization. The f 0 varied between individuals from 0. 4 to 1. 4 kHz and either lacked nonlinear phenomena or bored deterministic chaos, subharmonics or frequency jumps within the f 0. The g 0 varied between individuals from 3. 1 to 11 kHz and also either lacked nonlinear phenomena or bored sidebands. The simultaneous occurrence of f 0 and g 0 within the same whine resulted in biphonation, whereas the f 0 following g 0 resulted in frequency jump between the fundamentals. We found, that in <b>whines</b> <b>of</b> our object dogs nonlinear phenomena occurred significantly more often within the f 0 than within the g 0, and significantly more rarely in whines consisting both f 0 and g 0 than in whines consisting f 0 or g 0 singly. The occurrence of nonlinear phenomena showed the noticeable interindividual variability. We discuss mechanisms for pro-duction of the f 0 and g 0 in the Domestic Dog. Also, we propose, that the strong variability in <b>whines</b> <b>of</b> Domestic Dogs has a function to attract attention of the dog owners in situation of frustration, when a dog can’t cope with a problem...|$|R

2500|$|Ellison {{published}} {{two stories}} in the Cleveland News during 1949, and he sold a story to EC Comics early in the 1950s. Ellison moved to New York City in 1955 to pursue a writing career, primarily in science fiction. Over the next two years, he published more than 100 short stories and articles. He married Charlotte Stein in 1956, but they divorced four years later. He said of the marriage, [...] "four years of hell as sustained as the <b>whine</b> <b>of</b> a generator." ...|$|E

He was a chronic smoker who had been struggling with diabetes, which progressively impaired use of his extremities. He was buried in an authentic Kienholz installation; Robert Hughes wrote, [...] "is corpulent, embalmed body was wedged into the front seat of a brown 1940 Packard coupe. There was a dollar and a deck of cards in his pocket, a bottle of 1931 Chianti beside him and the ashes of his dog Smash in the back. He was set for the afterlife.

50|$|The {{system was}} less than popular in the Designs Department laboratory, due to the clatter of the Muirhead facsimile, and the <b>whining</b> <b>of</b> the printer, so the project was shelved.
