5|$|Janek (Idris Elba) is {{captain of}} the Prometheus. Following Holloway's suggestion, he lands the ship near the {{structure}} containing the Juggernaut. During the expedition Janek remains on the Prometheus, observing the schematics which Fifield's spectagraphs develop. He seduces Meredith Vickers while Sean Fifield and Rafe Milburn radio for direction. Vickers and Janek recognize the Juggernaut as an Engineer ship. While Shaw prepares to join Weyland on the expedition to awaken the Engineer, Janek says that the Engineers had nefarious intentions with the biological weapons and he will do <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> protect Earth's interests. When Vickers orders Janek to bring the Prometheus home, Shaw tells him that the Engineer ship is headed to Earth to release the black liquid and annihilate the human race. Janek decides to steer the Prometheus into the Engineer ship, and orders everyone to leave. Assistant pilots Chance and Ravel refuse and help Janek run the Prometheus into the Engineer ship, crippling it, sacrificing themselves, and saving the human race.|$|E

When his wife Carol visits him, he tells her to do <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> {{make a deal with}} Jack Beynon, a corrupt businessman in San Antonio, to free him. Beynon uses his influence and obtains Doc's parole on the condition that he takes part in a bank robbery with two of his henchmen, Rudy and Frank. During the robbery, Frank kills a guard. Rudy attempts a double-cross, shooting Frank and drawing a gun on Doc, who beats him to the draw and shoots him several times. Doc leaves Rudy for dead, but Rudy, having secretly worn a bulletproof vest, is alive albeit wounded.|$|E

500|$|Ben's unclear motives {{have led}} to {{speculation}} about his possible status as a villain. Ben Rawson-Jones from Digital Spy describes Ben as a [...] "supposed villain", pondering [...] "Could he really have been the good guy all along" [...] following the fourth-season episode [...] "The Shape of Things to Come". Actor Michael Emerson suspects where Ben's loyalties lie will always be ambiguous, making this a [...] "wonderful role". He is rarely shown losing control of his emotions, but when he does, it is done in a big and childish way. Emerson explains [...] "He's cold because any trace of warmth makes him vulnerable to his enemies". Ben is also known for {{his commitment to the}} island and doing <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> protect it. He has no qualms with Locke attempting to kill Naomi (Marsha Thomason) and even Jack after the survivors begin to call the freighter. He undertakes the risky and unpredictable step of moving the Island to prevent the freighter crew, and thus Charles Widmore, from finding it. He always has a plan and is described by Kevin Thompson from The Palm Beach Post as a [...] "know-it-all", which another reviewer thinks is because [...] " [...] talks quietly, in a menacingly measured drawl... with lots of pauses and emphases".|$|E
500|$|In The Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide (1985), Goin' Home {{was given}} five stars and called [...] "particularly heartfelt". In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, jazz critic Scott Yanow gave it four-and-a-half stars {{and found the}} performances [...] "compelling". He said listeners who are [...] "only familiar with Shepp's earlier Fire Music" [...] will see the album as a [...] "revelation." [...] Moon believed its tempoless mood [...] "gives the themes an extra shot of majesty" [...] and found it [...] "supremely melodic", writing that both Shepp and Parlan [...] "do <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> bring the spirit to the forefront." [...] Richard Cook gave it four out of four stars in The Penguin Guide to Jazz (2002). JazzTimes cited Goin' Home as one of [...] "the finest [...] of his career", and Tom Hull of The Village Voice cited it as SteepleChase's best release. Phil Johnson of The Independent wrote that the album [...] "can be listened to almost without cease." [...] Jazz historian Eric Nisenson called it [...] "one of the most moving albums of the Seventies", but qualified his praise by critiquing that Shepp, an iconic figure in free jazz, [...] "was no longer the firebrand who had so frightened and unsettled some white critics and jazz fans." [...] Nisenson felt that, like Pharoah Sanders, Shepp's [...] "trial by fire {{at the heart of}} the Sixties avant-garde had made him an unusually expressive musician," [...] and Goin' Home showed that he was [...] "finding inspiration in the entire black musical tradition." ...|$|E
500|$|Stelter {{described}} Frank and Claire Underwood as a [...] "scheming" [...] couple. Michael Dobbs, {{the author}} of the trilogy of novels upon which the British miniseries is based, compares the compelling nature of their relationship favorably to the characters in the original miniseries, and likens them to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Underwood has strong feelings for Claire, and frequently plots with her at night. He says, [...] "I love that woman. I love her more than sharks love blood." [...] While Underwood is Machiavellian, Claire, like Lady Macbeth, encourages her husband to do <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> seize power. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post describes her as an ice-queen wife. She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weakness, saying, [...] "My husband doesn’t apologize... even to me." [...] Her overt encouragement gives a credibility to their symbiosis. Smith says [...] "The Underwoods have proven themselves ruthless, manipulative, and robotic in their pursuit and lust of power." [...] Upon viewing a four-episode preview of season 2, Goodman says the series [...] "...sells husband and wife power-at-all-costs couple...as a little too oily and reptilian for anyone's good." [...] Willimon notes that [...] "What's extraordinary about Frank and Claire is there is deep love and mutual respect, but the way they achieve this is by operating on a completely different set of rules {{than the rest of us}} typically do." [...] Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara makes the case that House of Cards is a love story on many levels, but most importantly between Underwood and Claire. It is a story about a man who will commit any crime imaginable while in pursuit of power and a political wife who gives him the encouragement to pursue that power.|$|E

2500|$|The Communist Party’s {{campaign}} against Falun Gong {{was a turning}} point in the development of China’s legal system, representing a [...] "significant backward step" [...] in the development of rule of law, according to Ian Dominson.

However, the {{campaign against}} Falun Gong would not have been possible if carried out within the narrow confines of China’s existing criminal law. In order to persecute the group, in 1999 the judicial system reverted to being used as a political instrument, with laws being applied flexibly to advance the Communist Party’s policy objectives.

60|$|There was, {{within a}} few years, in the {{possession}} of a highly respectable and in every way credible and unimpeachable member of the Chuzzlewit Family (for his bitterest enemy never dared to hint at his being otherwise than a wealthy man), a dark lantern of undoubted antiquity; rendered still more interesting by being, in shape and pattern, extremely like such as are in use at the present day. Now this gentleman, since deceased, was at all times ready to make oath, and did again and again set forth upon his solemn asseveration, that he had frequently heard his grandmother say, when contemplating this venerable relic, 'Aye, aye! This was carried by my fourth son on the fifth of November, when he was a Guy Fawkes.' These remarkable words wrought (as well they might) a strong impression on his mind, and he was in the habit of repeating them very often. The just interpretation which they bear, and the conclusion to which they lead, are triumphant and irresistible. The old lady, naturally strong-minded, was nevertheless frail and fading; she was notoriously subject to that confusion of ideas, or, to say the least, of speech, to which age and garrulity are liable. The slight, the very slight, confusion apparent in these expressions is manifest, and is ludicrously easy of correction. 'Aye, aye,' quoth she, and it will be observed that no emendation <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> be made in these two initiative remarks, 'Aye, aye! This lantern was carried by my forefather'--not fourth son, which is preposterous--'on the fifth of November. And HE was Guy Fawkes.' Here we have a remark at once consistent, clear, natural, and in strict accordance with the character of the speaker. Indeed the anecdote is so plainly susceptible of this meaning and no other, that it would be hardly worth recording in its original state, were it not a proof of what may be (and very often is) affected not only in historical prose but in imaginative poetry, by the exercise of a little ingenious labour {{on the part of a}} commentator.|$|E
