5|$|The characters' {{body and}} facial {{movements}} were recorded using motion capture: these included capturing static figures for dialogue segments, and full-body capture for action sequences. The motion actors provided {{the basis for}} their characters' appearance: the actors were chosen based on how well they fitted with the staff's vision for the characters. The motion actors' facial expressions were captured using a special head-mounted rig the team had previously developed for the 2012 tech demo. When the character designs were being created, Nozue needed to regularly consult professional hairstylists to ensure that their chosen hairstyles for characters would be feasible in real life. For characters who appeared in the game, the team tried to keep their facial features {{as close as possible to}} their in-game counterpart. As with other Japanese CGI films aiming for a realistic tone, the team relied on photogrammetry and an extensive 3D scanning process combined with motion capture. Character clothing was created in a similar way to real-life clothing, with a number of different design variations being tested using paper cutouts. Something that both in-house and external staff contended with was making character movements realistic without being symmetrical; the biggest example was Libertus's need to walk on crutches for much of the movie, shifting his <b>weight</b> <b>balance</b> and movement speed.|$|E
25|$|At the 2015 North American International Auto Show a more refined, {{hardcore}} {{and limited}} production {{version of the}} GT350 was unveiled called the GT350R, it still has the GT350's 5.2-liter flat-plane crank V8, making a rated 526hp and 429lb.-ft. of torque, but items like the air conditioning, the stereo, the trunk floorboard, all the carpeting, the rear seats, and the backup camera have been removed. The GT350R is also equipped with carbon-fiber wheels that each weigh approximately 15 pounds less than the aluminum wheels on the GT350. Overall, the GT350R is 130lbs. lighter than the GT350. A larger splitter and rear wing help improve downforce, with the wing drawing the car's <b>weight</b> <b>balance</b> more rearwards. A Torsen limited-slip differential with a 3:73 axle ratio helps handling further. Serial #001 was sold at the 2015 Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale Auction for $1,000,000 with the proceeds to benefit the JDRF.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principle}} of solid drawing means {{taking into account}} forms in three-dimensional space, or giving them volume and weight. [...] The animator {{needs to be a}} skilled artist and has to understand the basics of three-dimensional shapes, anatomy, <b>weight,</b> <b>balance,</b> light and shadow, etc. For the classical animator, this involved taking art classes and doing sketches from life. One thing in particular that Johnston and Thomas warned against was creating [...] "twins": characters whose left and right sides mirrored each other, and looked lifeless. Modern-day computer animators draw less because of the facilities computers give them, yet their work benefits greatly from a basic understanding of animation principles, and their additions to basic computer animation.|$|E

2500|$|The saber (sabre) {{and similar}} blades {{such as the}} cutlass were built more heavily and were more {{typically}} used in warfare. Built for slashing and chopping at multiple enemies, often [...] from horseback, the saber's long curved blade and slightly forward <b>weight</b> <b>balance</b> gave it a deadly character all its own on the battlefield. Most sabers also had sharp points and double edged blades, making them capable of piercing soldier after soldier in a cavalry charge. Sabers continued to see battlefield use until the early 20th century. The US Navy kept {{tens of thousands of}} sturdy cutlasses in their armory well into World War II and many were issued to marines in the Pacific as jungle machetes.|$|E
2500|$|The Beaver is {{typically}} {{powered by a}} single [...] Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior radial engine. In order to provide the necessary <b>weight</b> <b>balance</b> for optimal loading flexibility, the engine was mounted as far rearwards as possible, resulting in elements intruding into the cockpit space, such as the oil tank being positioned within the center console between the pilot and copilot's feet and the main fuel tank within the forward belly of the aircraft, which also improves accessibility for replenishment. Many Beavers have had wing tip tanks also installed; careful fuel management between the various fuel tanks is required throughout flights {{in order to maintain}} the aircraft's center of gravity. The remanufactured DHC-2T Turbo Beaver is equipped with a [...] PT6A-34 turboprop engine.|$|E
2500|$|The {{swinging}} {{arms are}} mounted with large bearings to [...] "cross tubes" [...] that run {{side to side}} across the chassis; combined {{with the effects of}} all-independent soft springing and excellent damping, keeps the road wheels in contact with the road surface and parallel to each other across the axles at high angles of body roll. A larger than conventional steering castor angle, ensures that the front wheels are closer to vertical than the rears, when cornering hard with a lot of body roll. The soft springing, long suspension travel and the use of leading and trailing arms means that as the body rolls during cornering the wheelbase {{on the inside of the}} corner increases while the wheelbase on the outside of the corner decreases. As the corning forces put more of the car's weight on the inside pair of wheels the wheelbase extends in proportion, keeping the car's <b>weight</b> <b>balance</b> and centre of grip constant. promoting excellent road holding. The other key factor in the quality of its road holding is the very low and forward centre of gravity, provided by the position of the engine and transmission.|$|E

40|$|Every {{man from}} birth till {{date has been}} {{affected}} by weight and weight measurement {{in one way or}} the other. Weight is a body's relative mass or the quantity of matter contained by it, giving rise to a downward force. A <b>weighting</b> spring <b>balance</b> is a machine used to measure the weight of an object. Some weighing balances are manual weighing balance and the others are digital weighing balance. Computer based reverse engineering of the weighing spring balance is a systematic reconstruction of a manual spring <b>weighting</b> <b>balance</b> to include a digital hardware circuit that can interfaces the spring balance to the computer. This research work shows the benefits of interfacing a <b>weighting</b> <b>balance</b> to a digital computer. Weights of objects can be read directly off the computer and the records of transactions kept in the computer. Computer based reverse engineering of a manual <b>weighting</b> spring <b>balance</b> involves a systematic study of the existing <b>weighting</b> <b>balance,</b> the design and development of the hardware interface and the development of the software to read from the manual spring balance. The researchers came up with digital encoder interface that connects to the computer through the parallel port. The <b>weighting</b> spring <b>balance</b> spindle that indicates the weight of the measured object is connected with a conductor that runs through the digital encoder. Modularization research methodology is used in this research work were the research work is broken down into modules; the different modules were designed, developed, tested and integrated. The result of the research is a manual spring balance that can be interfaced to a computer so as to directly capture the data of a weighed object and other associated data or parameter into a digital computer...|$|R

2500|$|The Airacobra {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{production}} fighters to be conceived as a [...] "weapons system"; in this case the aircraft (known originally as the Bell Model 4) was designed to provide a platform for the 37mm T9 cannon. This weapon, which was designed in 1934 by the American Armament Corporation, a division of Oldsmobile, fired a 1.3lb (610g) projectile capable of piercing [...]8in (2cm) of armor at 500yd (450m) with armor-piercing rounds. The 200lb, 90-inch-long weapon had to be rigidly mounted and fire parallel to and close to the centerline of the new fighter. It would be impossible to mount the weapon in the fuselage, firing through the cylinder banks of the Vee-configured engine and the propeller hub as could be done with smaller 20mm cannon. <b>Weight,</b> <b>balance</b> and visibility problems meant that the cockpit could not be placed farther back in the fuselage, behind the engine and cannon. The solution adopted was to mount the cannon in the forward fuselage and the engine in the center fuselage, directly behind the pilot's seat. The tractor propeller was driven via a [...] drive shaft made in two sections, incorporating a self-aligning bearing to accommodate fuselage deflection during violent maneuvers. This shaft ran through a tunnel in the cockpit floor and was connected to a gearbox in the nose of the fuselage which, in turn, drove the three- or (later) four-bladed propeller via a short central shaft. The gearbox was provided with its own lubrication system, separate from the engine; in later versions of the Airacobra the gearbox was provided with some armor protection. The glycol-cooled radiator was fitted in the wing center section, immediately beneath the engine; this was flanked on either side by a single drum shaped oil cooler. Air for the radiator and oil coolers was drawn in through intakes in both wing-root leading edges and was directed via four ducts to the radiator faces. The air was then exhausted through three controllable hinged flaps near the trailing edge of the center section. Air for the carburetor was drawn in via a raised oval intake immediately aft of the rear canopy.|$|E
