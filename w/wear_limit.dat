40|$|This paper {{describes}} a systematic methodology to estimate allowable limits for rail head wear {{in terms of}} vertical head-height loss, gage-face side wear, and/or {{the combination of the}} two. This methodology is based on the principles of engineering fracture mechanics. The concept of applying the principles of engineering fracture mechanics to examine structural integrity was originally introduced by the U. S.

Moreover, the approach in conducting rail integrity research sponsored by the Government is based on damage tolerance principles. The fracture mechanics methodology to estimate rail head <b>wear</b> <b>limits</b> is based on various assumptions regarding operational and environmental factors. These factors include rail size, foundation modulus, temperature difference, train speed, and rail test interval (i. e. tonnage between rail tests).

40|$|Abstract. Nickel super-alloys are {{characterized}} by: high temperatures resistance, high hardness and low thermal conductivity. For this reason they {{are widely used}} in critical operating conditions. However, due to their excellent mechanical properties, nickel super-alloys are hard to machine. Tool wear {{is a major problem}} in nickel super-alloys machining; the high temperature at the tool rake face is a principal wear factor. Flank wear is {{the most common type of}} tool wear; it offers predictable and stable tool life evaluation. In this work, the authors present a flank wear evaluation in Inconel 718 turning, in order to develop a predictive model for CAM optimization. An appropriate database has been developed thanks to an experimental activity (VB as a function of: the cutting time T, cutting speed S and feed rate F). The objective of the optimization procedure is to maximize the Material Removal Rate (MRR) under the constraint represented by the flank <b>wear</b> <b>limit.</b> The developed procedure operates directly on the part program code, using the original one as starting point for the application of the knowledge about the wear behaviour.

This work was motivated by switching the grinding of fir-tree root forms from grinding with conventional abrasive wheels to vitrified CBN wheels for reducing overall production cost and enhancing productivity.

40|$|Abstract: Stringent {{in-service}} {{and operating}} requirements oblige marine diesel engines to possess {{high levels of}} reliability and availability. To achieve the desired reliability and availability levels, {{it is necessary to}} carry out costly maintenance activity on the cylinder liners, the wear on which is a major factor in causing diesel engine failure. This paper presents a s-based methodology {{that can be used to}} carry out a condition-based estimate of liner reliability with respect to failure through excessive wear, and to plan condition-based maintenance activity. The wear process is described through an ad hoc cumulative damage model, and the reliability of the liners is estimated on the basis of wear measures, and predictions of wear increase. The approach proposed allows reducing maintenance costs without noticeably affecting liner reliability. In fact, it gives the probability of inspecting or replacing liners only when there is a high likelihood that their wear level will exceed the <b>wear</b> <b>limit</b> before the next inspection date. The proposed model, and planning procedure have been applied to a data set consisting of wear measures of the cylinder liners of two SULZER RTA 58 engines equipping twin ships of the Grimaldi Group...|$|E

However, calcification and <b>wear</b> <b>limit</b> their durability, {{and the development of}} new and improved bioprosthetic valve designs is needed and must be evaluated in a reliable animal model. We studied glutaraldehyde-treated valves 6 months after implantation to evaluate bioprosthetic valve complications in the mitral position in juvenile pigs. Materials The study material comprised eight, 5 -month old, 60 -kg pigs. All pigs received a size 27, glutaraldehyde-treated, stented, Carpentier-Edwards S. A. V. mitral valve prosthesis. After six months, echocardiography was performed, and the valves explanted for gross examination, high resolution X-ray, and histological evaluation. Results Five pigs survived the follow-up period. Preexplant echocardiography revealed a median peak and mean velocity of 1. 61 m/s (range: 1. 17 - 2. 00) and 1. 20 (SD = ± 0. 25), respectively, and a median peak and mean pressure difference of 10. 42 mmHg (range: 5. 83 - 16. 55) and 6. 51 mmHg (SD = ± 2. 57), respectively. Gross examination showed minor thrombotic depositions at two commissures in two valves and at all three commissures in three valves. High resolution X-ray imaging revealed different degrees of calcification in all explanted valves, primarily in the commissural and belly areas. In all valves, histological evaluation demonstrated various degrees of fibrous sheath formation, limited immunological infiltration, and no overgrowth of host endothelium. Conclusions Bioprosthetic glutaraldehyde-treated mitral valves can be implanted into the mitral position in pigs and function after 6 months. Echocardiographic data, calcification, and histological examinations were comparable to results obtained in sheep models and human demonstrating the suitability of the porcine model. </p...|$|E

This work aims to highlight the wear resistance of the harrows discs manufactured, consolidated and sharpened differently. The tests were conducted in the laboratory and the field of the Faculty of Exploitation and Repair of Agricultural Machinery of the State Technical University of Kirovograd (Ukraine) in 2015. The technical equipment consists of devices for consolidation by electric discharge and for measurement the linear wear of discs, a harrow, a sand test bed, a tractor and discs made of different materials and technologies. Some parameterized were collected during the laboratory test each 5 ha and up to 20 ha of operation and in the fields each 30 ha until the time limit of exploitation. The Laboratory tests have shown that after twenty (20) ha of operation, the wear resistance of the experimental discs made of steel 65 G and consolidated by electric discharge with simultaneous grinding (sharpening angle of 30 °) is 2. 95 times higher than the discs in series made of steel 28 MnB 5. The field experiment gave the following results: According to agro technical requirements, the plowing depth limit of serial discs made of steel 28 MnB 5 was reached after an operating duration of 120 ha while for experimental discs made of steel 65 G and consolidated by electric discharge with simultaneous grinding (sharpening angle of 30 degrees) this duration is of 156 ha.

40|$|In 2011, UK {{heritage}} railways carried 7. {{1 million}} passengers on over 530 miles of track, accounting for £ 92 million of direct revenue. Much {{of this operation}} uses steam locomotives with relatively high axle loads and reciprocating motion {{which can lead to}} uneven track loading. However the majority of track components on heritage lines are antiquated due to reliance on cascaded components and in some cases on the deliberate retention of chaired bullhead rail for conservational purposes. This research provides an assessment of current methodologies regarding the management of steel rails on heritage railways: the measurement of rail wear, the assessment of the residual strength in worn rails and the subsequent determination of a rail’s critical <b>wear</b> <b>limit.</b> It describes the effectiveness and adequacy of some of the inspection regimes in use and addresses the risks associated with the variation in these regimes across the sector. A survey of permanent way supervisors on UK standard gauge heritage lines is reported and the permanent way in use is and the perceived requirements for its renewal are summarised. Due to low speeds and traffic levels, the main line standards for rail wear are generally thought to be inappropriate for heritage railway use whilst ‘high-tech’ methods for measuring crack propagation and rail wear are inaccessible due to cost. A common approach is to employ inspection and maintenance regimes developed by British Rail for use on rural lines. Utilising a fracture mechanics approach to predicting rail failure developed in the USA, the research highlights a more relevant set of guidelines, providing a matrix detailing acceptable wear limits based on inspection frequency, rail type, formation condition and traffic levels. The findings will benefit the heritage rail industry by minimising risk whilst accounting for resource limitations...|$|E
