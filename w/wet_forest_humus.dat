50|$|Sri Lanka {{detached}} from the Deccan peninsula during {{the end of the}} Miocene epoch, but its origin lies within Gondwanaland. According to biogeographic patterns southwestern lowland <b>wet</b> <b>forests</b> became isolated from the nearest <b>wet</b> <b>forests</b> in the mainland soon after the separation when climatic changes created drier, warmer conditions in the lowland. Although the two lands bridged in the Pleistocene subsequently, intervening dry habitat prevented the exchange of wet climate adapted species with <b>wet</b> <b>forests</b> in India. This resulted in southwestern species to evolve and specialize separately, giving rise higher to the higher level of endemism that can be seen today.|$|R
