In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
500|$|Effects {{supervisor}} Scott Farrar {{said that}} Narita did a [...] "good {{job of keeping}} [...] dark. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a stage situation of aluminum walls and shiny metal, {{it can be a}} problem. But by keeping the light down, you see a little less and it becomes more textural. Hiro was very keen to avoid that over-bright stage look." [...] The budget meant that many of the Enterprise sets were redresses of those used in [...] Meyer and production designer Herman Zimmerman were only able to make minor adjustments to these sets, as the television series was still in production at the time of filming.|$|E
500|$|Following the complaints, Fox removed {{any mention}} of Catholicism from the scene, {{resulting}} in the line [...] "The church..." [...] Scully was reportedly furious with Fox's actions. In an interview in Los Angeles Times, Scully said, [...] "people can say hurtful things {{to each other about}} their weight, their race, their intelligence, their sexual preference, and that all seems up for grabs, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> religion, some people get very nervous." [...] Marisa Guthrie of Boston Herald also criticized the network, describing it as [...] "caving in" [...] to the Catholic League's protests. She wrote, [...] "Hollywood has always been gun shy of controversy, but recent displays of self-censorship on the part of entertainment industry executives make us cringe [...] Granted Catholics, as a group have endured an ample amount of bashing, but The Simpsons is an equal opportunity offender." [...] Howard Rosenberg, a writer for Los Angeles Times, criticized Fox's actions as well. He argued that the network had a biased opinion towards Catholicism and that, had the scene mentioned a different religion, it would have been accepted. He also wrote, [...] "Given its famous flaunting of sleaze and death-defying motorcycle leaps, the big news here is that Fox has standards. Its latest production is Censors Who Kill Jokes." ...|$|E

500|$|Tancharoen {{hinted that}} the series would {{continue}} Age of Ultrons theme of [...] "diving {{into the world}} of A.I. [...] things may not go as planned". On what makes Aida different from the villain Ultron, Whedon explained that [...] "Aida started as something that was supposed to mimic human behavior. Ultron came out almost a fully fleshed-out creature with his own agenda, where she’s been discovering hers along the way." [...] He added that instead of thousands of robots, the LMDs would be presented as android versions of the other characters in the series. Whedon said of themes that are raised in the second pod, [...] "there are issues of reality and identity. Trust is always an issue in a spy organization. It’s much worse when you don’t know if the person next to you is the person next to you ... <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> trust, that’s when things get emotional." [...] The pod ends with the Melinda May LMD seemingly destroying herself and all the other known LMDs besides Aida, concluding her specific arc which explored the nature of humanity and identity. Asked if any of these LMDs survived this act, and could carry over to the third pod of the season, Whedon said [...] "We’ll see, but the idea was to put that chapter behind us." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{have speculated}} that Clark's {{inexperience}} at giving [...] "soundbite" [...] answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, {{he was asked if}} he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, [...] "At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," [...] then [...] "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said it both ways because <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position—on balance, I probably would have voted for it." [...] Finally, Clark's press secretary clarified his position as [...] "you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." [...] After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, The New York Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War". Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, [...] "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "There's a {{tone and}} feeling to the song, there's a militia, a march {{and a kind}} of rambunctious energy to it that, for me, I {{immediately}} wanted to tap into. I showed [...] some references from the classic rebellious zones of the world. We live in very orderly society in America, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> Brazil, you get into the Middle East, you get into Africa, you get into Eastern Europe, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> places like that, there's a different sort of 'we run this town' [...] There's less order and more chaos. So we looked at a lot of those references, new photos and historical photos, to capture that kind of falling-apart feeling." [...] "We wanted you to feel uneasy throughout the piece," [...] he said. [...] "We wanted there to be a constant layer of tension through the piece. Even in the way I shot — where the camera comes by Jay, it doesn't stop on him, it goes to Rihanna — there's kind of this chaos of revealing and covering and concealing. And things happen offscreen that you don't see. I think people are really gonna flip on this".|$|E
2500|$|Napoleon {{continued}} territorial acquisitions worried Fitzwilliam, with Grey {{writing to}} Fox on 19 March 1803 that Fitzwilliam was [...] "full of indignation against Bonaparte, and of fears {{for the situation}} of the country". War resumed in May. Fitzwilliam wrote to Laurence on 14 August on the Volunteer system: [...] "All the higher orders, particularly <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the manufacturing district, tremble at the thought of arms being put {{into the hands of the}} people indiscriminately...having none in authority over them, at least, not such as ought to be". He instead advocated volunteers in regiments where [...] "we are sure at least of having proper commanders". On the recent coming together of Pitt, Fox and Windham he said: [...] "It is that sort of junction, which I feel to be necessary for the security of the country in these times, and in all for the maintenance of the Constitution in its true spirit". On 6 December he wrote to Lady Rockingham: ...|$|E
