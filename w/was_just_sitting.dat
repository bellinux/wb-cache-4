25|$|The {{desirability}} of hiring directors over 60 is fairly diminished in this marketplace. At the same time, I hadn't had a good-sized hit {{in quite a}} while. And, frankly, I went {{through a couple of}} experiences that left me pretty disgusted with it all, and I was thinking the time had passed. I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> at home reading magazines and looking out the window — a couple of projects I had had just fallen apart — when I got a call from Sly, who had sent me a script.|$|E
500|$|Swift and Liz Rose wrote [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] during Swift's {{freshman}} year at Hendersonville High School. She conceived the idea {{in the midst of}} her mathematics class: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> there, and I started humming this melody." [...] She then related the melody to a predicament she was encountering at the moment. Swift knew that she and her senior boyfriend would break {{up at the end of}} the year when he left for college. In order to cope with the complicated emotions she was experiencing, Swift wrote the song. Rose said Swift showed up at her after school job, writing songs for Sony/ATV Music, [...] "with the idea and the melody, knowing exactly what she wanted." [...] She desired for the song to capture the sweetness and sadness of loving and losing someone. It was written about all the different things that would remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together, once he departed. [...] "To her surprise, the first thing that came to mind was [...] love of Tim McGraw's music." [...] Several personal details were listed for the song. McGraw's mentioning was a reference to Swift's favorite song, [...] "Can't Tell Me Nothin" [...] from his 2004 album Live Like You Were Dying, rather than McGraw as a person. The writing process, as with [...] "Our Song", took place in approximately twenty minutes, and was executed with the use of a piano.|$|E

According to ancient First Nations legend, Point Grey is the [...] "Battleground of the West Wind." [...] The rock {{the god of the}} West Wind represents, which <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> off the point, is called Homolsom. As the rock <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> between their two territories, Homolsom is half a Squamish word and half a Fraser River language word.|$|R

2500|$|In November 2010, Lynch {{released}} two electropop music singles, [...] "Good Day Today" [...] and [...] "I Know", {{through the}} independent British label Sunday Best Recordings. Describing why he created them, {{he stated that}} [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> and these notes came and then I went down and started working with Dean [...] and then these few notes, 'I {{want to have a}} good day, today' came and the song was built around that". The singles were followed by an album, Crazy Clown Time, which was released in November 2011 and described as an [...] "electronic blues album". The songs were sung by Lynch, with guest vocals on one track by Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and composed and performed by Lynch and Dean Hurley.|$|E

5000|$|Major {{publishing}} {{companies were}} less accepting of Lee's later works. The companies which Lee worked with for numerous years even refused {{to look at}} her proposals.

I got up and struck a light; and when I found that the locks and bolts were just as I had left them, another soothing laugh welled in my heart and rippled from my lips. I took my pipe and lit it, and <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> down before the fire, when--down went the pipe out of my nerveless fingers, the blood forsook my cheeks, and my placid breathing was cut short with a gasp! In the ashes on the hearth, side by side with my own bare footprint, was another, so vast that in comparison mine was but an infant's! Then I had had a visitor, and the elephant tread was explained.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the custom}} of that city that the officer for {{the day of the}} palace guards should receive all his food direct from the king's kitchen. One day, when Nur Mahomed's turn came to be on duty, he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> down to a delicious stew that had been sent in from the palace, when one of those gaunt, hungry dogs, which, in eastern countries, run about the streets, poked his nose in at the open guard-room door, and looked at Nur Mahomed with mouth {{watering}} and nostrils working. The kind-hearted young man picked out a lump of meat, went to the door, and threw it outside to him. The dog pounced upon it, and gulped it down greedily, and was just turning to go, when it staggered, fell, rolled over, and died. Nur Mahomed, who had been lazily watching him, stood still for a moment, then he came back whistling softly. He gathered up the rest of his dinner and carefully wrapped it up to carry away and bury somewhere; and then he sent back the empty plates.|$|E

People <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>sitting</b> in a coffee shop and devastation has happened. They don't articulate their feelings. Instead, they are putting sugar in their coffee and spooning cake. They are having a quiet conversation but meanwhile a life is coming apart.|$|R
