5|$|Charles V of France {{maintained}} {{the terms of}} the treaty of Brétigny but encouraged others in Aquitaine to challenge the authority of the Plantagenets in Aquitaine. The prince, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>suffered</b> a debilitating illness for nearly a decade which often restricted his movement to being carried in a litter, returned to England, where he soon died. John of Gaunt assumed leadership in France with limited success, and peace negotiations over several years were inconclusive.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} studies of changes in motor {{function}} of the biliary system in convalescent children after hepatitis A virus (rHAV) and B (rHBV) characterized by disorders of the biliary system are presented in the article. Children <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> HAV and HBV display a variety of pathologic and pathophysiologic changes conditioned by various hepatitis viruses. The combination of diet therapy, drug-free (physiotherapy) and medication (Phosphogliv) interventions contributes to the overall normalization of {{the function of the}} biliary tract in all children <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> HAV. The same is true about the majority of convalescent children after HBV. This allows the authors to recommend the complex of interventions as the optimal approach to the rehabilitation of children <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>suffered</b> viral hepatitis.  </p...|$|R
5|$|Imelda Marcos was {{instrumental}} in the 1980 exile of opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr., <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>suffered</b> a heart attack during his imprisonment. Martial law in the Philippines was later lifted in 1981 but Ferdinand Marcos continued to be president. While her husband began to suffer from lupus, she effectively ruled in his place. Aquino returned in 1983 but was assassinated at the Manila International Airport upon his arrival. With accusations against her beginning to rise, Ferdinand created the Agrava Commission, a fact-finding committee, to investigate her, ultimately finding her not guilty.|$|E
5|$|Louis sent small expeditions {{one after}} one to Italy at the {{beginning}} of his war against Joanna, because he did not want to harass the Italians <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>suffered</b> from a famine the previous year. His first troops departed under the command of Nicholas Vásári, Bishop of Nyitra (now Nitra in Slovakia), on 24 April 1347. Louis also hired German mercenaries. He departed from Visegrád on 11 November. After marching through Udine, Verona, Modena, Bologna, Urbino, and Perugia, he entered the Kingdom of Naples on 24 December near L'Aquila, which had yielded to him.|$|E
5|$|The first {{description}} of thrombosis of the cerebral veins and sinuses {{is attributed to}} the French physician Ribes, who in 1825 observed thrombosis of the saggital sinus and cerebral veins in a man <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>suffered</b> from seizures and delirium. Until {{the second half of}} the 20th century it remained a diagnosis generally made after death. In the 1940s, reports by Dr Charles Symonds and others allowed for the clinical diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis, using characteristic signs and symptoms and results of lumbar puncture.|$|E

The few remaining Breguet 19s of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group mounted attacks on the bridge over the Drava at Gyékényes. After the Germans reinforced their bridgehead with two more battalions, they overcame the Yugoslav defenders, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>suffered</b> significant losses and were running low on artillery ammunition. About 18:00, the 53rd Infantry Regiment withdrew to Koprivnica with its artillery support, and it remained in the town during the night. At 23:00, following orders from Petrović {{that he was to}} attack on 8 April at all costs, Nedeljković issued orders for a counterattack to be carried out early on 8 April.|$|E
5|$|In September, Mary {{was fully}} {{prepared}} to depart for the Netherlands and resume her post {{when she was}} informed of Charles's death.

Both were so severe that her doctors thought that she had died. When Joan visited her, Mary was still determined to fulfill the promise she had given to Charles and assume the regency in the Netherlands, but she was weak and feverish. She died only few weeks later, in Cigales on 18 October 1558.|$|E
5|$|Maryland {{entered the}} game having been {{knocked out of}} the running for the Atlantic Division title the {{previous}} week, but able to play spoiler for Boston College. The Eagles were playing to earn a berth to the ACC Championship Game for the second consecutive year. Additionally, competing within a closely contested ACC, Maryland could have greatly improved its standing for bowl selection with an eighth win. The Eagles were the fifth ranked team to face Maryland. The Terrapins were, to that point, 4–0 against top-25 opposition and the only team to beat four ranked opponents in 2008. Boston College was fielding second-string quarterback Dominique Davis in his first career appearance. He replaced starter Chris Crane, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>suffered</b> a broken collarbone the previous week.|$|E

5|$|Nani's Premier League debut came in United's opening {{match at}} home to Reading on 12 August as a {{substitute}} for Wayne Rooney, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>suffered</b> a foot injury. Two weeks later, on 26 August, Nani scored his first competitive goal for United, netting a 30-yard goal in the 69th minute against Tottenham Hotspur. Nani also set up crucial goals for Louis Saha and Nemanja Vidić, allowing United to defeat both Sunderland and Everton 1–0, respectively. He returned to face his previous club, Sporting CP, in a Champions League tie in September, though it was teammate and fellow former Sporting player Cristiano Ronaldo who scored the winner in a 0–1 victory. Nani opened the scoring in a 4–1 home victory over Middlesbrough on 27 October.|$|E

The Thrillseekers got simultaneous pins, but it was Jeter who received the championship match. On August 3, Jeter defeated the OVW Heavyweight Champion, Brent Albright, to win the championship, after Ken Anderson and Daniel Puder interfered on his behalf. After the match, Jeter turned into a heel (villainous character) by attacking Cappotelli, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>suffered</b> an injury. In the following weeks, Jeter also attacked Albright, announcer Dean Hill, and official Danny Davis.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{thousand}} carvers {{and three}} thousand volunteers {{were put to}} work for the construction Akshardham.

The initial stone cutting was done by machine, while the detailed carvings were done by hand.

While the first, filed by advocate Arvind Shukla, had sought direction to the Election Commission to derecognise Mr Raj Thackeray's MNS for his controversial remarks against North Indians, the other one, filed by RU Upadhyay, sought {{protection for the}} North Indians in Maharashtra and compensation to those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>suffered</b> from the attacks. The court, however, refused to pass any direction {{on the grounds that}} the issue was related to the aspect of law and order, and it thus directed the petitioners to have faith in the Bombay High Court and seek further hearing there.|$|E

On June 9, offensive lineman and the team's first-round draft pick in 2011 Gabe Carimi was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for a sixth-rounder in the 2014 draft. The following day, Evan Rodriguez, Dale Moss and Demetrius Fields were waived.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{season began}} {{as the previous}} one had ended with just one win and six defeats, their worst start since the 1902–03 season when they were relegated. On 17 March 2012, manager Owen Coyle travelled to the London Chest Hospital with Fabrice Muamba <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>suffered</b> from a cardiac arrest whilst playing against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane in a FA Cup match. Muamba stayed in a critical condition for several weeks and Coyle was widely praised for {{the manner in which}} he represented the club during the period.

5|$|About 10:30, the Germans {{reached the}} {{defensive}} line near Torčec, and fighting began. A few Breguet 19s of the 4th Air Reconnaissance Group attached to the 1st Army Group which had survived an early morning raid on their airfield the previous day, mounted attacks on the bridge over the Drava at Zákány. After the Germans reinforced their bridgehead with two more battalions, they overcame the Yugoslav defenders, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>suffered</b> significant losses and were running low on artillery ammunition. About 18:00, the 53rd Infantry Regiment withdrew to Koprivnica along with its artillery support, and remained in the town during the night. The bridge at Zákány was destroyed later that day by sabotage units. At 23:00, following orders from Petrović {{that he was to}} attack on 8 April at all costs, Nedeljković issued orders for a counterattack to be carried out early on 8 April.|$|E
5|$|Additional Waffen-SS {{units were}} added from the Ukrainians, Albanians from Kosovo, Serbians, Croatians, Turkic, Caucasians, Cossack, and Tatars. The Ukrainians and Tatars, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>suffered</b> {{persecution}} under Stalin, were likely motivated primarily by {{opposition to the}} Soviet government rather than ideological agreement with the SS. The exiled Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Amin al-Husseini was made an SS-Gruppenführer by Himmler in May 1943. He subsequently used antisemitism and anti-Serb racism to recruit a Waffen-SS division of Bosnian Muslims, the SS-Handschar. The year-long Soviet occupation of the Baltic states {{at the beginning of}} World War II resulted in volunteers for Latvian and Estonian Waffen-SS units. The Estonian Legion had 1,280 volunteers under training by the end of 1942. Approximately 25,000 men served in the Estonian SS division, with thousands more conscripted into Police Front battalions and border guard units. Most of the Estonians were fighting primarily to regain their independence and as many as 15,000 of them died fighting alongside the Germans. In early 1944, Himmler even contacted Pohl to suggest releasing Muslim prisoners from concentration camps to supplement his SS troops.|$|E
5|$|Around 23:00 on 15 August, {{elements}} of the Serbian 1st Combined Division encountered outposts {{set up by the}} invading Austro-Hungarian army on the slopes of Cer Mountain and fighting erupted. The Austro-Hungarian positions were lightly held, and their defenders were driven back away from the mountain. By midnight, fierce clashes between the Austro-Hungarians and the Serbs were underway and chaos ensued in the darkness. By the morning of 16 August, the Serbians had seized the Divača Range and dislodged the Austro-Hungarians from their positions in the village of Borino Selo. The Austro-Hungarians, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>suffered</b> heavy casualties during the fighting, retreated in some disorder. As the day progressed, the Serbs drove the 21st Infantry Division off the slopes of Cer to prevent it from linking with the 2nd Army in Šabac.|$|E
