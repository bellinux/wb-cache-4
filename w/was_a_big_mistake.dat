500|$|Discussing {{the impact}} of the {{government}} shutdown on the Republican Party, Gingrich later commented that, [...] "Everybody in Washington thinks that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake.</b> They're exactly wrong. There had been no reelected Republican majority since 1928. Part of the reason we got reelected... is our base thought we were serious. And they thought we were serious because when it came to a show-down, we didn't flinch." [...] In a 2011 op-ed in The Washington Post, Gingrich said that the government shutdown led to the balanced-budget deal in 1997 and the first four consecutive balanced budgets since the 1920s, as well as the first re-election of a Republican majority since 1928.|$|E
500|$|For the film's [...] "negative" [...] response, David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews {{warned that}} the film was [...] "strictly for kids." [...] Nusair stated that {{although}} Ashanti can sing, she cannot act. Joshua Tyler of Cinema Blend explained that Dorothy visiting the Wizard of Oz to become a star instead of going back home <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake,</b> and that it showed how shallow society has become. R.J. Carter of The Trades gave the film a B-, also stating that Dorothy's wish to become a star was a selfish one. Ultimate Disney's review found that the extended version of the film did more harm than good; Andy Dursin of The Aisle Seat said that the original film was [...] "dull" [...] and that the extended version was actually an improvement. Cold Fusion Video felt that although the film was entertaining, it lacked the heart and wit of Jim Henson's Muppet films. Bryan Pope of DVD Verdict said that the film drained the Muppets of their spirit and was slightly gratuitous. Techtite TV reviews felt that the film was done poorly on all levels, and that the film was on the higher end of TV-PG.|$|E

2500|$|... 5–57 against Northamptonshire helped Bright {{keep his}} {{spot for the}} third test. This was the famous [...] "miracle match" [...] at Headingly. Bright was not used at all in England's first innings and only bowled four overs in the second innings, despite Ian Botham's famous counter-attacking knock which helped England win the game after {{following}} on. Bright was the last man dismissed. Hughes later admitted not bowling Bright more in England's second innings <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake.</b>|$|E

Sinkewitz initially denied the allegation and called for his B sample to be tested. German television withdrew from covering the Tour in protest when his positive test came to light. On 31 July Sinkewitz subsequently retracted his denial and confessed to using a testosterone gel on his upper arms whilst training. Accepting the positive test result, Sinkewitz stated that: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake</b> and irresponsible toward my team, colleagues, the sponsor and the whole of cycling." [...] T-Mobile responded to the admission by sacking Sinkewitz with immediate effect.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after Armenia {{became a}} member of the Council of Europe in 2001 {{authorities}} in Yerevan stated that they expected EU assistance in the construction of a gas pipeline linking Armenia to neighbouring Iran and in the lifting of Turkish and Azerbaijani blockade, but Armenian Energy Ministry Spokeswoman Zhasmena Ghevondian told Radio Liberty that the agreement with the IAEA and the EU that Metsamor unit-2 would only be in operation until the end of 2004 was [...] "no longer realistic." [...] Armenian Deputy Energy Minister Areg Galstyan indicated that the plant, which provides 40 per cent of Armenia's energy and sells excess power to neighbouring Georgia, should remain running until 2016 and possibly 2031 as, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake</b> to shut the plant in 1988; it created an energy crisis and the people and the economy suffered.

50|$|Mounting the two fuselages on {{the wings}} with no {{connection}} between them further aft turned out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake.</b> Fokker <b>was</b> still using wing warping instead of ailerons for roll control, so when the wings were warped, the fuselages were deflected in opposite directions, either up or down depending upon which way the aircraft was rolled. This led to some very divergent flight characteristics. The test program was brief.|$|R

2500|$|At {{least one}} Cambridge University cricketer {{believed}} that Ranjitsinhji should have {{played for the}} team in 1892; he played in two trial games with moderate success, but Jackson believed he was {{not good enough to}} play first-class cricket. Jackson was probably also the reason Ranjitisinhji did not play cricket for Trinity College until 1892, despite his success for other teams. Jackson himself wrote in 1933 that, at the time, he lacked a [...] "sympathetic interest for Indians", and Simon Wilde has suggested that prejudice lay behind Jackson's attitude. Jackson also said in 1893 that underestimating Ranjitsinhji's ability <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake.</b> However, Ranjitsinhji made his debut for Trinity in 1892 after injury ruled out another player and his subsequent form, including a century, kept him in the college team, achieving a batting average of 44, only Jackson averaging more. However, the other players ignored Ranjitsinhji in these matches. That June, watched by Ranjitsinhji, Cambridge were defeated by Oxford in the University Match; Malcolm Jardine, an Oxford batsman, hit 140 runs, many with a version of the leg glance; Jackson would not alter his tactics and Jardine was able to score easy runs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{only reason}} that Angel didn't come back...it's a very simple thing. Because our ratings were up, because of our {{critical}} attention, Joss specifically asked Jordan Levin, who {{was the head of}} The WB at the time, to give us an early pick-up because every year they [...] wait so long to give Angel a pick-up [...] a lot of us [...] turn down jobs hoping that Angel will continue– he [...] didn't want that to happen. So, he was feeling very confident and he [...] just asked Jordan, [...] "Like, make your decision now whether you're going to pick us up or not," [...] and Jordan, sort of with his hands tied, with his back up against the wall, called him the next day and said, [...] "Okay, we're cancelling you." [...] Jordan's no longer there and The WB has since recognized...I believe Garth Ancier at The WB said that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake</b> to cancel Angel. There was a power play that happened that just didn't fall out the way they wanted it to. We wanted to get an early pick-up, we didn't. In fact we forced them [...] to make a decision, and with his hand forced he [...] made the decision to cancel us.|$|E
2500|$|For his part, Melcher {{defended his}} actions by {{explaining}} that the band's performances in the studio were lackluster and that the orchestration was needed {{to cover up the}} album's musical shortcomings. [...] In a 1977 interview with The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan, Melcher attempted to illustrate the situation in the recording studio during the making of the album and also explain his rationale for the orchestral additions: [...] "Several members of the group were involved in divorces and they were hiding from their wives. It was complete bedlam in the studio. Everyone had too many problems. There was a lack of interest on everybody's part. I was trying to save the album, but it was a mistake. I should have called a halt." [...] Melcher also succinctly highlighted his lack of confidence in the quality of the material that the band had recorded: [...] "I think the orchestration <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake,</b> but the songs were weak." [...] As for not obtaining the band's consent for the overdubs, Melcher explained [...] "I admit that I wasn't in consultation with them a lot and I didn't really deal with Clarence, Battin or Parsons on these matters. But I'm sure it was inconceivable that McGuinn did not know about the orchestration." ...|$|E

50|$|It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> popular {{misconception}} that Kateri Maa <b>is</b> Bahuchara Mata, <b>a</b> folk goddess of Gujarat, {{while the two}} devis are separate. People use images/murtis of Bahuchara and Khodiyar to worship her and this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake,</b> especially if they offer sacrifices alcohol and cigarettes to these devis.She is also considered to be Katyayini Devi, the sixth Navadurga but this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake</b> as both Devis are different Devis with different reasons. People also use murtis of Venkateswara who <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Southern Indian Incarnation of Lord Vishnu and Shrinathji who is actually Lord Krishna as a seven-year old {{and it is in}} this form that he lifted up The Govardhan mountain after Indra created storms and rains. The habit of most people is that they usually consider all the deities with a dark complexion, whether male or female to be Kateri Maa and this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very <b>big</b> <b>mistake</b> that many people are making. Most of these misconceptions began in Guyana and has thus spread all over the world. It's not only Kateri that many people have misconceptions about, they use images of Shani as Sangili Karuppan and Khandoba as Madurai Veeran. What some people do not know is that when they make offerings of rum and cigarettes to these deities, it angers them and would cause disasters in their life, and then they would want to know what is happening to them. There are those who try to shed light on this but there are many that would bring them down and let the misconceptions roll on.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic review stated [...] "This double-CD set <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake.</b> Teaming drummer Max Roach and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie {{together}} as a duo might have worked had it taken place 20 years earlier when Dizzy {{was still in his}} musical prime. However the immortal players did not even discuss {{what they were going to}} play beforehand and the result <b>is</b> <b>a</b> series of rambling sketches, essentially a long drum solo with occasional trumpet interludes that are full of clams" [...] yet awarded the album 4½ stars.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1970s, Velásquez began {{focusing}} on {{national and international}} companies in addition to local growers. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake</b> to go after individual farmers," [...] he said, [...] "instead of {{focusing on}} the large corporations. [...] We {{spent a lot of}} years doing that, and it was a mistake." [...] From 1970 to 1983, Velasquez implemented a long-term strategy to build public support for the farmworkers, publicizing the discrimination, low wages, and often appalling working conditions they faced. In 1976, workers at a tomato cannery in Warren, Indiana, struck over the employer's tactic of overrecruiting workers in order to force down wages. The workers spontaneously barricaded themselves inside the cannery, refusing to allow the perishable crop inside until their grievances had been addressed. The workers asked FLOC to intervene. A federal district court issued an injunction requiring that the workers vacate the premises, but they refused. Although nearly all the workers were arrested, there was extensive publicity about the strike, the employer's overrcruitment tactic, the low wages and unsanitary conditions the workers suffered, {{and the use of the}} Immigration and Naturalization Service to intimidate workers and avoid paying them (through deportation proceedings). Velásquez later said the tomato cannery strike helped improve FLOC's negotiating and worker mobilization skills and provided a trial run for the union's dealings with large corporations.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his ability as a player, Lazetich developed a reputation as [...] "a wild character {{if there ever was}} one." [...] Decades later, Los Angeles Times columnist Frank Finch wrote that, although modern players were bigger and faster, he preferred the characters of the early NFL over the [...] "faceless robots" [...] of the modern game. [...] He focused in particular on Lazetich: [...] "A character's character was Ram middle guard Milan (Sheriff) Lazetich. [...] He was a blithe spirit from Montana who'd played college football at Michigan before joining the Rams in '46 for a five-year stint. [...] That he lasted that long with the club is remarkable in light of what he pulled at Dan Reeves' Christmas party for the team {{at the end of the}} '46 season." [...] Reeves, the Rams' owner, invited the team to a party at his home; the centerpiece was a large cake in the design of a football field topped with a full-size football covered in chocolate. [...] Teammate and Pro Football Hall of Famer Tom Fears later recalled the incident this way:"During the course of predinner libations, someone asked Lazetich to demonstrate his punting prowess. [...] I don't think he'd ever kicked a football before in his life. [...] They dared him to boot the chocolate football, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>mistake</b> because Laz wasn't the kind of guy to take a dare lightly. [...] He ambled out to the kitchen, plucked the football off the top of the fancy cake, brought it out in the front room and drove his toe into it with beautiful form and a perfect follow through. [...] Cake, frosting and everything else that was loose was well distributed over the ceiling, walls, windows and drapes. ... It also was the last party Reeves ever held in his house for the Rams." ...|$|E

30|$|The {{first thing}} to take into {{consideration}} when analyzing the proposed modifications is that all contributions should <b>be</b> disregarded and <b>a</b> different angle of analysis should be pursued.
