5000|$|Vertisol - {{inverted}} soils. They are clay-rich {{and tend}} to swell when <b>wet</b> and <b>shrink</b> upon drying, often forming deep cracks into which surface layers can fall. They are difficult to farm or to construct roads and buildings due to their high expansion rate. They constitute 2% of soils worldwide.|$|R
25|$|Although Typha {{are native}} wetland plants, {{they can be}} {{aggressive}} in their competition with other native species. They have been problematic in many regions in North America, from the Great Lakes to the Everglades. Native sedges are displaced and <b>wet</b> meadows <b>shrink,</b> likely {{as a response to}} altered hydrology of the wetlands and increased nutrient levels. An introduced or hybrid species may be contributing to the problem. Control is difficult. The most successful strategy appears to be mowing or burning to remove the aerenchymous stalks, followed by prolonged flooding. It may be more important to prevent invasion by preserving water level fluctuations, including periods of drought, and to maintain infertile conditions.|$|R
50|$|Small {{automatic}} valves {{are available to}} fit individual radiators. As these need to operate in any orientation, they use a different mechanism rather than a float. The Aladdin HVC30 system uses a 'hygroseal' cartridge. This is a small disc of material that expands when <b>wet</b> and <b>shrinks</b> if warm and dry. A dry valve acts as an air vent until a dribble of water passes through it and swells the cartridge. If the valve dries out again, it re-opens. A characteristic of these valves is that they function best on the hot delivery side of a radiator and may not open as vents unless the water supply is hot.|$|R

500|$|The {{colorful}} Chinle, {{which appears}} on the surface {{in many parts of}} the southwestern United States and from which the Painted Desert gets its name, is up to [...] thick in the park. [...] It consists of a variety of sedimentary rocks including beds of soft, fine-grained mudstone, siltstone, and claystone—much of which is bentonite—as well as harder sandstone and conglomerate, and limestone. Exposed to wind and water, the Chinle usually erodes differentially into badlands made up of cliffs, gullies, mesas, buttes, and rounded hills. Its bentonite clay, which swells when <b>wet</b> and <b>shrinks</b> while drying, causes surface movement and cracking that discourages plant growth. Lack of plant cover makes the Chinle especially susceptible to weathering.|$|R

50|$|In 1986, La Mancha Negra first {{appeared}} as a smudge 50 yards long, it was noticed by workers as they patched the 30-year-old asphalt on a highway between Caracas and its airport. Initially, concerns for the blob were low but soon it spread. 100 meters, a mile, soon 8 miles of highway were covered with an unknown material that contracted and expanded with the weather. It grew when conditions were hot and <b>wet</b> but <b>shrunk</b> when {{it was cold and}} dry. It seemed to prefer tunnels and the uphill slopes outside the airport. Despite its gummy texture, the blob rendered the roadway extraordinarily unsafe, causing vehicles to crash into one another or run off the road. In 1991, a group of experts consulted President Carlos Andrés Pérez about the problem but could not pinpoint the cause of the substance. 1,800 deaths were then attributed to La Mancha Negra in the five years before 1992 and by that time, the stain had spread throughout the city of Caracas.|$|R

5000|$|These tradesmen made wheels for {{carts and}} wagons by first {{constructing}} the hub (called the nave), the spokes and the rim/felloe segments (pronounced fellies) and assembling them all into a unit {{working from the}} center of the wheel outwards.

40|$|Vertisols {{are deep}} clayey soils, {{with more than}} 45 % clay, {{dominated}} by clay minerals such as smectites, which expand upon <b>wetting</b> and <b>shrink</b> upon drying. The most important physical characteristics of Vertisols are a low hydraulic conductivity and stickiness when wet and high flow of water through the cracks when dry. They become very hard when dry and {{in all the time}} are difficult to work. During the rainy season, the cracks disappear and the soil becomes sticky and plastic with a very slippery surface which makes Vertisols hardly trafficable when wet. Water movement in soil that change volume with water content is not well understood and the management of swelling soil remains problematic. Swelling or shrinking result in vertical displacement of the wet soil, which involves gravitational work and contributes to an overburden component to the total potential of the soil water. Many swelling soils crack and the network of cracks provides pathways for rapid flow of water, which prejudice application of theory based on Darcian flow. One – dimensional flow of water in a swelling system requires material balance equation for both the aqueous and solid phases. The analytical data offers some values of particle – size distribution, compression, swelling degree and pressure, plasticity index, elastic modulus, triaxial shear, angle of shear and load carrying capacity in order to realize a foundation study for some constructions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} some of {{the most}} important swelling characters of expansive soils when used as foundation materials to support various types of civil engineering structures. Expansive soils are considered among difficult foundation materials and expand upon <b>wetting</b> and <b>shrink</b> upon losing moisture. They are considered problematic soils for architectural and civil engineers. These types of soils may cause minor to major structural damages to pavements as well as buildings. It is therefore essential to detect swelling soils from non-problematic foundation soils before any civil engineering projects are constructed over or adjacent to them. The study begins with definition of expansive soils and shows its distributions in the world as well as the basic causes for swelling potential that these type of soils poses. It is also shown that, the most probable depth of expansion to check for possible swelling potential for swelling soils is soil’s active zone. This zone is the most upper depth of expansive soil and it may extend up to 20 ft. (6 m) below ground level. The moisture content of soil through active zone varies during different seasons while in lower part of expansive soil the moisture content stays constant during hot and cold season. Among various methods to check for swelling potential, plastic index and liquid limits are two most crucial factors, as these factors tend to increase, the swelling potential increase as well...|$|R
25|$|The {{common clay}} {{minerals}} are montmorillonite or smectite, illite, and kaolinite or kaolin. These minerals tend {{to form in}} sheet or plate like structures, with length typically ranging between 10−7m and 4x10−6m and thickness typically ranging between 10−9m and 2x10−6m, {{and they have a}} relatively large specific surface area. The specific surface area (SSA) is defined as the ratio of the surface area of particles to the mass of the particles. Clay minerals typically have specific surface areas in the range of 10 to 1,000 square meters per gram of solid. Due to the large surface area available for chemical, electrostatic, and van der Waals interaction, the mechanical behavior of clay minerals is very sensitive to the amount of pore fluid available and the type and amount of dissolved ions in the pore fluid. To anticipate the effect of clay on the way a soil will behave, it is necessary to know the kinds of clays as well as the amount present. As home builders and highway engineers know all too well, soils containing certain high-activity clays make very unstable material on which to build because they swell when <b>wet</b> and <b>shrink</b> when dry. This shrink-and-swell action can easily crack foundations and cause retaining walls to collapse. These clays also become extremely sticky and difficult to work with when they are wet. In contrast, low-activity clays, formed under different conditions, can be very stable and easy to work with.|$|R
40|$|Dolerite {{occurs in}} appreciable {{quantity}} in Cross River State and {{these have been}} locally quarried for construction without proper evaluation of its suitability as construction stones. The physical and mechanical properties {{as well as the}} general mineralogy were analyzed in this work to determine the suitability of these dolerites as construction aggregate. Results shows that uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) ranges from 34. 2 N/mm 2 to 56 N/mm 2, durability 96. 9 % to 99. 21 %, specific gravity (SG) 2. 46 to 3, water absorption 0. 14 % to 1. 59 % with an average porosity of 1. 19. The medium/strong compressive strength, low porosity and water absorption, average density and specific gravity and high durability makes it suitable for construction but the presence of plagioclase and pyroxene which sometimes alters to clays and chlorite causing swelling when <b>wet</b> and <b>shrinking</b> when dry is a major limitation. Thus these dolerites without proper treatment/stabilization are not suitable for industrial/heavy traffic construction but can be readily and effectively applied in concrete for light foundation loads and buildings. Results also show that these dolerite are hard, tough, compact and durable and can replace the more expensive/competent construction stones (granite and /or gneiss) for light construction works, however the environmental conditions within which it would be applied should be evaluated and the first few meters around a dolerite sill or dyke should be avoided during quarrying for construction stones as the more softer rocks are found there...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} wet–dry and moist–dry cycling on the {{mechanical}} properties of reed (Arundo donax L.) were investigated. Because water-soluble extractives were lost through <b>wetting,</b> the reed <b>shrunk</b> in its tangential direction, and its dynamic Young’s modulus and loss tangent decreased during wet–dry cycling. On the other hand, the reed swelled in its radial direction {{because of the}} recovery of cell collapse, which had been induced by drying from a green state. Consequently, the resonant frequency of the reed monotonically increased during wet–dry cycling, whereas no clear trend was seen in bending rigidity. During moist–dry cycling, the equilibrium moisture content of reed decreased slightly. Such a reduction in hygroscopicity was attributed to the aggregation of deliquescent extractives. The changes in the dimensions and vibrational properties of the reed specimens during moist–dry cycling were qualitatively similar to those during wet–dry cycling.

30|$|The wood {{properties}} of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) vary within and among trees. In order to supply quality-controlled timber and decrease wood processing costs, {{it is expected}} that logs will be sorted by their wood properties and processed in suitable ways. Sugi trees were planted in large numbers during 1950 – 1970 in Japan, and thinned trees have been used as boxed-heart timber for poles and beams in housing construction. The boxed-heart timber, which is symmetrical about the pith, has little distortion by growth-stress release during sawing. However, it sometimes has bow and is susceptible to surface checking during drying. The drying of the timber proceeds from the surface and begins to shrink, while the interior can still be quite <b>wet</b> and not <b>shrink.</b> The shrinkage of the surface-layer is restricted by the inner layer, so tension drying stress is induced in the surface layer, while compression drying stress is induced in the inner layer. Tangential shrinkage is free at the corners of the timber, but is restricted between the corners owing to the shrinkage anisotropy between the tangential and radial directions, which induces large tension drying stress [1]. When the stress overcomes the tension strength of the timber, surface checking is induced. Recently, to shorten the drying time and prevent surface checking, various kiln-drying methods have been developed [2]. However, there is little information on why the drying defects such as bow and surface checking vary among timber that is dried together. The variations in the drying defects are considered to be induced by multiple wood-properties, which affect the water transportation, the deformation of the timber, and the surface checking occurrence and elongation. Therefore, the moisture content, density, shrinkage, and mechanical properties are suggested {{to be related to the}} bow and surface checking of the timber.|$|R
40|$|Unsaturated soils can be often {{encountered}} in practical applications. In particular, even though index properties of a soil as construction material are left unchanged, the compaction procedure (moulding water content, compaction energy, etc.) influences the mechanical {{response of the}} resulting material, its after compaction degree of saturation (i. e. suction) and, more generally, the earth constructions behaviour (Vinale et al., 1999). This paper tries {{to contribute to the}} discussion of the above mentioned aspects of soil behaviour presenting the results of a series of suction controlled triaxial tests performed on an optimum water content and wet of optimum compacted soil. Details on the used apparatus are reported in Rampino et al. (1999). The experimental program was conceived in order to analyse the effects of both suction and fabric on soil behaviour. Overall, it consisted of 23 tests, i. e. isotropic compression, constant mean net stress (p-ua) shear and “standard” shear tests, all carried out under drained conditions and constant suction. The investigated suction levels were 0, 100, 200, 300 kPa for the optimum compacted soil and 0, 100, 200 kPa for the wet compacted material. The optimum and the wet compacted specimens exhibited very different behaviour in all the stages of the tests. For example, during the equalisation stages, the optimum material swelled and absorbed water, while the <b>wet</b> soil <b>shrunk</b> and expelled water. This behaviour is explained by the measurements of the after compaction suction (ua-uw) o. Using the Imperial College tensiometer (ua-uw) o was measured as high as 800 kPa for the optimum material (then causing wetting during equalisation) and as low as 60 kPa for the wet specimens (then causing drying during equalisation) – a relevant effect of moulding procedure. The results of the isotropic compression tests highlight a strong effect of suction on soil compressibility. In particular, the compressibility index decreases about 25 % from 0 to 200 kPa of suction. The greatest amount of this effects occurs in a limited suction range (0 - 100 kPa) while tends to a threshold value for (ua-uw) greater than 200 kPa. Comparing experimental findings on the optimum and the wet specimens, it is observed that an increase in moulding water content induces a severe increase in compressibility. In addiction, data indicate that both the shape and the position of the after compaction loading-collapse loci (LC) are largely affected by moulding water content. Thus, soil susceptibility to collapse strongly depends on preparation water content. The data of shear tests show that suction significantly affects large strain shear stiffness and resistance. For instance, in the range 0 - 200 kPa of suction, the strengthening with (ua-uw) is expressed by an apparent cohesion varying from 0 to 200 kPa for the optimum and from 0 to 150 kPa for the wet compacted soils. The results seems to be well grouped for suction levels and can be interpreted by straight fitting lines having the same M coefficient in the q:(p-ua) plane. The effect of moving from the optimum to the wet compaction water content is then a decrease in stiffness and in apparent cohesion, as well as a reduction {{of the size of the}} after compaction yield surface. The large series of experimental results obtained on Metramo silty sand can be satisfactorily modelled by the modern theories for unsaturated soils (Alonso 1990, Wheeler & Sivakumar 1995), if it is assumed that the different preparation procedures yield to different soils. The influence of suction and moulding water content on the observed behaviour clearly emerged in all the tests phases and highlights the need of carefully considering these two variables in handling engineering problems involving compacted soils as construction materials...|$|R
