500|$|To Harold Bloom, {{the last}} lines of Keats's ode [...] "rivals any as an epitome of the myth-making faculty". He elaborates further on this <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>writes,</b> [...] "The poem Ode to Psyche is unique, and also central, for its {{art is a}} natural growth out of nature, based as it is upon a very {{particular}} act of consciousness, which Keats arrests in all its concreteness." ...|$|E

Veloso says that cê is a more [...] "colloquial" [...] version of você, used often in everyday speech. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> lyrics, Veloso typically writes the word você, but sings cê when performing. The inspiration for the album's title came when he wrote cê instead of você and {{thought of it as}} an appropriate title.|$|E

In 1925, Stojanović initiated {{the creation of}} an anthology of Yugoslav lyric poetry. On this project, he worked with Feldman and Gustav Krklec. The poets completed the anthology, but for an unknown reason it was never published.

500|$|The most {{important}} advice he gives aspiring songwriters {{is to write}} what you know or what you've experienced. [...] "Use reality as the springboard to whatever you're writing about", Paul said. Paul also says that being a successful songwriter is like being a journalist who writes about what he sees and knows, the times people are living in and the things people are facing today. [...] "The journalist {{looks out the window}} and writes about what is really happening." [...] "I make sure it's real. [...] I don't want to fictionalize about things I haven't witnessed." [...] Paul states that over the years he's learned the value of simplicity in writing. He's learned that he can say more <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> more simply and direct. [...] "It's almost as if you can be complex and intricate by adopting a shorter, less complicated structure." [...] "I'm not doing rocket science -- I'm a storyteller", he said. [...] "I hope to inspire people to think and feel and to walk out with more than they came in with." ...|$|E

500|$|Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode a B– rating. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a {{negative}} review {{and called it}} [...] "easily {{the worst of the}} season". He awarded it a 4 out of 10 and concluded that, [...] "We can only hope that none of the remaining episodes are Shiban-related, and pray that he can do a much better job <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> for [...] next season." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five, and called the entry [...] "solid and efficient". The two complimented Shiban's directorial efforts, noting that [...] "as a director [...] makes 'Underneath' shine", but were critical of some of the [...] "trademark X-File moments", citing [...] "the surprise appearance of a face in the bathroom mirror" [...] and [...] "the climactic fight in a sewer" [...] as examples. Shearman and Pearson, however, wrote positively of Shiban's realistic depiction of Doggett. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, wrote that the episode felt [...] "very familiar" [...] but was impressed with the production design on the sewer set.|$|E
500|$|The Satanic Bible often {{uses the}} terms [...] "God" [...] and [...] "Satan" [...] interchangeably, except when {{referring}} to the concepts of these as viewed by other religions. LaVey also occasionally uses the term [...] "God" [...] to refer to other religions' views of God, and [...] "Satan" [...] or synonyms {{to refer to the}} idea of god as interpreted by LaVeyan Satanism, as <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>writes,</b> [...] "When all religious faith in lies has waned, it is because man has become closer to himself and farther from 'God'; closer to the 'Devil.'" [...] Throughout The Satanic Bible, the LaVeyan Satanist's view of god is described as the Satanist's true [...] "self"—a projection {{of his or her own}} personality—not an external deity. Satan is used as a representation of personal liberty and individualism. Satan is also used as a metaphor for the ideas connected with the early Christian view of Satan or the serpent: wise, defiant, questioning, and free-thinking. LaVey discusses this extensively in The Book of Lucifer, explaining that the gods worshipped by other religions are also projections of man's true self. He argues that man's unwillingness to accept his own ego has caused him to externalize these gods so as to avoid the feeling of narcissism that would accompany self-worship.|$|E

2500|$|The female {{promiscuity}} {{explanation of}} female sexuality was echoed at least 12 years earlier by other evolutionary biologists, {{and there is}} increasing scientific awareness of the female proceptive phase. Though Dixson classifies humans as mildly polygynous in his survey of primate sexuality, {{he appears to have}} doubts, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>writes,</b> [...] "One might argue that ... the female's orgasm is rewarding, increases her willingness to copulate with a variety of males rather than one partner, and thus promotes sperm competition." [...] Ryan and Jethá use this as evidence for their theory that partible paternity and promiscuity were common for early modern humans.|$|E

2500|$|Some modern {{commentators}} {{interpret the}} word ubhatovyanjañaka as {{including those who}} are not physical intersex, but display behavioral and psychological characteristics of both sexes, such as a woman who is attracted to other women. 5th-century Buddhist writer Buddhaghosa describes ubhatobyanjanaka as people with the body of one sex but the [...] "power", or gender of the other. Leonard Zwilling argues that in this account Buddhaghosa does not in fact describe [...] "hermaphroditism" [...] but rather bisexuality or homosexuality. Janet Gyatso pointed out that Zwilling destroys his own argument that pandakas are homosexuals <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>writes,</b> [...] "The Vinaya, in fact, {{goes so far as to}} distinguish sexual activity between normative males from sexual relations between a socially normative male and a pandaka." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{the title}} {{suggests}} the scope {{is limited to}} simple cooking instructions, Ekiho Miyazaki, an abbot of the Sōtō school's head temple Eihei-ji, summarizes the work's importance <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>writes,</b> [...] "Instructions for the Cook are instructions for life". The work was written in 1237, ten years after Dōgen's return from his time in Song Dynasty China. At {{this time he was}} practicing at the monastery he had founded four years earlier, Kōshō-ji. During this period he wrote several of his best known works such as Bendōwa, Fukan Zazengi, and Genjōkōan. However, the language and style in the Instructions are regarded as more concrete and straightforward than these other popular works. Instructions for the Cook is included as {{the first part of the}} Eihei Shingi, or Rules of Purity for Eihei-ji.|$|E
2500|$|The {{historian}} Charles A. Beard identified Federalist No. 10 {{as one of}} {{the most}} important documents for understanding the Constitution. In his book An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution of the United States (1913), Beard argued that Madison produced a detailed explanation of the economic factors that lay behind the creation of the Constitution. At the outset of his study, Beard makes his point <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> that Madison provided [...] "a masterly statement of the theory of economic determinism in politics" [...] (Beard 1913, p.15). Later in his study, Beard repeated his point, only providing more emphasis. [...] "The most philosophical examination of the foundations of political science is made by Madison in the tenth number," [...] Beard writes. [...] "Here he lays down, in no uncertain language, the principle that the first and elemental concern of every government is economic" [...] (Beard 1913, p.156).|$|E
