5|$|Despite its poor organization, Maria brought heavy {{rainfall}} to {{portions of the}} east Caribbean, notably Puerto Rico. Numerous roadways and homes were flooded, and as the storm passed through the extreme northeastern Caribbean, over 15,000 people went without power. In addition, tropical storm-force <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> observed {{on many of the}} U.S. Virgin Islands. As the system passed west of Bermuda, brief tropical storm-force sustained <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> recorded, along with higher gusts; rainfall on the island, however, was minimal. In Newfoundland, strong <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> recorded, but rainfall totals were relatively minimal. There were no deaths reported in association with Maria, although the storm caused $1.3 million (2011 USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|Gale force winds {{affected}} the Delmarva Peninsula; on Poplar Island in Talbot County, Maryland, winds peaked at 1600UTC on September 3. The strongest <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> {{confined to the}} Atlantic coastline, with outer rainbands producing heavy rainfall in Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland. Fierce <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> observed in Cape Henlopen, Delaware, with the strongest gales occurring after the eye passed over the area.|$|E
5|$|Tropical storm-force <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> {{reported}} across {{parts of}} the Azores, primarily on the eastern islands. The strongest <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> reported on Santa Maria Island, where 10-minute sustained winds reached 49mph (79km/h) with gusts to 59mph (94km/h). Ponta Delgada faced 38mph (61km/h) winds, with the peak recorded gust being 52mph (85km/h). No damage or fatalities were reported.|$|E

5|$|An off-duty Northwest Airlines {{pilot who}} {{observed}} the crash told newspapers {{that he believed}} that the airliner had been struck by lightning.

5|$|Based on the {{arrangement}} of effects in New England, meteorologist William C. Redfield deduced that the wind field and center of tropical cyclones are circular; previously the <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> {{believed to be in}} a straight line.|$|E
5|$|By September4, {{the maximum}} <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> found {{closer to the}} center of {{circulation}} and the cyclone developed a warmer core, a main feature in tropical cyclones. An anticyclone also developed over Babe and later that day, the storm transitioned into a tropical cyclone. By this time, Babe had turned nearly due north and was near hurricane-status. Around this time, reconnaissance missions into the storm found a closed eyewall with an eye measuring roughly 23mi (37km) in diameter. Another reconnaissance flight that day found sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h); however, these <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> located roughly 65mi (100km) from the center and considered to be unrepresentative of the storm's actual intensity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Winds</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} {{light to}} moderate with some strengthening in force {{during the summer}} and monsoon seasons. During the southwest monsoon season, <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> mainly south-westerly to westerly. In the post-monsoon season <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> light and variable in directions in the mornings and north-easterly to easterly in the afternoon. In the winter and summer seasons <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> mostly from directions between south-west and north-west, with northerly or north-easterly winds blowing on some afternoons.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the rapid}} {{weakening}} before landfall, Erica produced intense winds, gusting {{to a record}} 202km/h (125mph) in Nouméa. Ten-minute sustained <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> recorded up to 144km/h (89mph) around {{the center of the}} storm.|$|E
5|$|In {{mainland}} Honduras, the <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> not as damaging as the rainfall, although offshore islands sustained heavy damage {{due to high}} winds. Offshore northern Honduras, it {{was estimated}} that Mitch produced waves as high as 13m (44ft).|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Nova Scotia, Edouard produced {{heavy rainfall}} from 3.7 to 5.5inches (95 to 140mm). <b>Winds</b> <b>were</b> moderate, peaking at 75mph (120km/h) in Cape Breton Highlands. The hurricane also caused beach erosion on southeastern Nova Scotia.|$|E

5|$|The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) and Macau's Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau both hoisted {{strong wind}} signal 1 on August1 {{as the system}} was located within 800km (497mi) of their {{respective}} cities. As Prapiroon neared the southern coast of China, the signal was raised to strong wind signal 3 as strong <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> expected to strike the area. In Macau in particular this was further increased to strong wind signal 8 SE on August3, as gale-force <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> expected in the southeastern areas. All signals were cancelled the next afternoon as Prapiroon moved inland.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{produced}} a wind gust of 71mph (115km/h) in Caye Caulker, although stronger <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> {{possible in a}} convective band to the north. On the Yucatan Peninsula, heavy rainfall led to mudslides across Quintana Roo, leaving some areas isolated.|$|E

5|$|Unsettled {{weather in}} the Cape Verde Islands brought about by Tropical Storm Debbie was blamed for a plane crash on September 6 that killed 60 people. Strong <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> also {{reported}} from the Bay of Biscay to locations in northern Norway.|$|E
5|$|Upon making landfall, the {{tropical}} storm produced strong winds {{over a wide}} area. The strongest <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> reported by a station in San Antonio, Texas, which reported 40mph (65km/h) winds, {{far removed from the}} storm's center; these strong <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> likely due to squalls. Heavy rainfall was also reported, though the rains mainly occurred to the east of the passing tropical cyclone. Precipitation peaked at 10in (254mm) in Ville Platte, Louisiana. The tropical storm produced three tornadoes over the Southern United States which collecitvely caused $39,000in damage and caused two fatalities. Two of the tornadoes formed in Mississippi while one formed in Louisiana. Several other people were also injured by the tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|While slowly {{crossing}} Guam, Pamela produced {{winds of}} over 185km/h (115mph) {{across the entire}} island over a six-hour period, causing widespread heavy damage. Typhoon-force <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> reported for 18hours, and tropical storm-force <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> reported for 30hours. As the eye was crossing the island, the winds rapidly vacillated between gusts of 150km/h (90mph) to calmness {{in the span of}} a few minutes; this created a large pressure gradient that caused additional damage. The typhoon dropped a total of 856mm (33.7in) of rainfall, including 690mm (27in) in a 24-hour period, on the island. This contributed to May 1976 being Guam's wettest month on record.|$|E

5|$|Advisories, {{along with}} {{coordination}} between the National Observatory at Havana and U.S. Weather Bureau, were credited for the reduced deaths in Cuba. Weather observations were also readily available from Cuban meteorological stations. On October 25, the cyclone's hurricane force <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> {{expected to remain}} off the Florida east coast, although gale-force <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> anticipated from the Florida Keys to Palm Beach, Florida. Accordingly, storm warnings were issued from Key West, Florida to Vero Beach, Florida. Military aircraft were transported to safer locations, while watercraft were stored in harbors and rivers. Hotels and resorts were boarded up on the barrier islands. The Bahamas received warnings {{well in advance of}} the hurricane. The hurricane turned quickly to the east, which reduced the threat to Bimini, Cat Cay, Grand Bahama, and the Abaco Islands.|$|E
5|$|Although Dean {{remained}} {{away from}} the United States coastline, it produced storm tides of 1.7ft (0.51m) to North Carolina. In Atlantic Canada, hurricane-force <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> reported in Nova Scotia and Sable Island. Newfoundland reported winds of only 50mph (80km/h). Moderate rainfall was reported on Newfoundland, with most areas of the island experiencing at least 1in (25.4mm) of precipitation. Rainfall on Newfoundland peaked at 2.7in (68.58mm) on the south coast of the island, near the location of Dean's landfall. A majority of rainfall was reported {{on the west side}} of Dean, but minimal precipitation had been recorded to the east of the storm. High <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> reported on the eastern side of the storm, however, with lighter winds along the western quadrants of Dean. Offshore, waves up to 26ft (7.92m) were reported and Sable Island reported rainfall of 0.59in (15mm). Although there were no reports of damage in Atlantic Canada from Hurricane Dean, three sailors had to be rescued by the Canadian Coast Guard when their boat got dismasted during the storm.|$|E
5|$|As Carol was {{threatening}} Bermuda, planes flew {{away from the}} island and ships returned to harbor for safety.
