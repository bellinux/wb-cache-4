5|$|General Clinton began {{movements}} {{to cross over}} to {{the northern end of}} Sullivan's Island. Assisted by two sloops of war, the flotilla of longboats carrying his troops came under fire from Colonel William Thomson's defenses. Facing a <b>withering</b> barrage of grape shot and rifle fire, Clinton abandoned the attempt.|$|E
5|$|Brown sat {{his players}} down in {{classrooms}} and relentlessly tested {{them on their}} knowledge of the playbook, requiring them to copy down every play in a separate notebook for better retention. He was a terse man, and his criticisms of players were often <b>withering</b> and ruthless. He prohibited players from drinking, told them not to smoke in public and made coats and ties mandatory on road trips. They were not to have sex after Tuesday night during the season.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as it}} was {{sufficiently}} dark, Grayburn led his platoon along the ramp to the bridge, their faces blackened and their boots muffled with strips of torn up curtains. The platoon moved forward {{on either side of the}} girders along the sides of the road, but was quickly spotted by enemy forces on the bridge. Grayburn was shot in the shoulder but continued to press his men on, until the <b>withering</b> enemy fire became too intense and he was forced to pull them back. He was the last person to descend from the ramp into cover.|$|E

5|$|Grey's troops marched {{around the}} head of the Acushnet River and camped on the eastern banks. The {{following}} day, they embarked on their boats, but General Grey decided that Fairhaven should also be raided. Concurrently, militia were beginning to arrive to defend Fairhaven, with Major Israel Fearing taking command from an elderly colonel who was reluctant to pursue an active defense. The British approached Fairhaven on the morning of September 6, and Fearing arrayed about 150 men between the village and their landing point. The British set fire to a few nearby buildings and then headed for the village. At this point, Fearing's men unleashed a <b>withering</b> volley of musket fire, and the British precipitately retreated to their boats.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this stage}} that the attack began to go seriously wrong. Strong winds blowing off the land swept the smoke screen {{into the face of}} the {{advancing}} cruisers, blinding their commanders who attempted to navigate by dead reckoning. The same wind disclosed the Inshore Squadron to the German defenders who immediately opened up a <b>withering</b> fire on the blockships. With their volunteer crews suffering heavy casualties, the commanders increased speed despite the poor visibility and continued groping through the narrow channels inshore, searching for the Stroom Bank buoy which directed shipping into the canal.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Mantua (1799) was {{a four-month}} {{effort by the}} Austrian army to regain a {{presence}} in northern Italy after being excluded from that region by Napoleon Bonaparte through the successful French Siege of Mantua in 1797. In April 1799, the Austrians placed a military blockade around Mantua {{as part of the}} War of the Second Coalition with the intent of <b>withering</b> the French by attrition. While the diminishing food supplies and losses weakened the French army, the Austrians received reinforcements and attacked on 4 July 1799. By the end of the month, the French agreed to surrender.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>withers</b> of {{the horse}} are {{considered}} in evaluating conformation. Generally, a horse should have well-defined <b>withers,</b> as they are considered an important attachment point for {{the muscles of the}} torso. <b>Withers</b> of medium height are preferred, as high <b>withers</b> make it difficult to fit a saddle and are often associated with a narrow chest, and low <b>withers</b> (known as [...] "mutton withers") do not provide a ridge to help keep the saddle in place.|$|R
5|$|The {{result was}} devastating. Five {{thousand}} French soldiers {{fell in a}} matter of minutes and the entire engagement stood on the brink of disaster. Not only did they face the Russian fire, but the French artillery pounded them as well. Augereau's Corps melted under the <b>withering</b> fire, the bayonets of the Russians, and the onslaught of the cavalry; as they retreated to their own lines, Napoleon was nearly captured at the Eylau churchyard, where he had established a lookout post, but his escort cavalry chased the Russians away.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the night}} of October 21/22, the large {{artillery}} forces the Egyptians had concentrated began harassing the Israelis. The Egyptians had identified command posts and tank concentration areas for attack, especially at Serabaeum and Ain Ghasin, as well likely routes of attack, and continued to provide a <b>withering</b> fire support during the Israeli attack. At morning, Israeli aircraft attacked Egyptian positions, concentrating on Jebel Mariam, Abu 'Atwa, Nefisha, and al-Galaa' base, and at noon they destroyed the Abu Gamoos Bridge at Ismailia. At this time, company-sized units of armor and infantry advanced against the Upper Bridge and the bridges at Nefisha but were repelled by Sagger missiles.|$|E
5|$|Although Desha was universally {{acknowledged}} {{as the leading}} candidate during {{the early months of}} the campaign, as election day approached, some began to doubt whether he could withstand the <b>withering</b> attacks of the Anti-Relief Party. The Frankfort Argus, a pro-Desha newspaper, remained confident, however, predicting that the Relief candidate would win by a margin of 4-to-1. On election day, Desha secured a comfortable victory, receiving 38,378 votes, nearly 60% of the votes cast, and carrying large majorities even in some strongly Anti-Relief counties. Tompkins garnered 22,499 votes, with his support concentrated mostly in Central Kentucky. Russell finished third with 3,900 votes. Desha and his allies in the General Assembly interpreted the victory as a mandate from the voters to aggressively pursue their debt relief agenda.|$|E

5|$|Darwin {{held the}} {{opposite}} position; he maintained that Linnaeus's works should be translated as literally {{as possible and}} that the sexual references in the nomenclature should be retained. In 1783 and 1787, the Botanical Society of Lichfield, founded by Darwin {{and several of his}} friends specifically to translate Linnaeus's works, issued their own English translation, A System of Vegetables, that categorized over 1400 plants. Assisted by Samuel Johnson, they coined over fifty new botanical words; it is this work, along with the group's The Families of Plants that introduced the words stamen and pistil into the English language, for example. By 1796 their translation had prevailed and <b>Withering</b> was forced to adopt their vocabulary in later editions of his work.|$|E
5|$|Despite the <b>withering</b> fire, Klenau's force reached Essling's edge, {{where his}} men set up 64 {{artillery}} pieces and bombarded the French {{for nearly an}} hour. Taking the village by storm, Austrian cavalry poured into the village from the north, and the French were pushed out in a methodical advance. Klenau's batteries were able to fire on the French-held bridges south of the village, over which the French had to retreat. In bitter house-to-house fighting, the Austrians entered the village. Combat at the granary was especially brutal, as Hungarian grenadiers battled unsuccessfully to dislodge the French from their positions {{in the second and}} third floors. The battle resumed at dawn of 22 April. Masséna cleared Aspern of Austrians, but while he did so, Rosenberg's force stormed Jean Lannes' position at Essling. Lannes, reinforced by Vincent Saint-Hilaire's division, subsequently drove Rosenberg out of Essling. At Aspern, Masséna was driven out by Hiller and Bellegarde's counter-attacks.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{this theory}} was updated, {{suggesting}} that a close relative of the beta-amyloid protein, and not necessarily the beta-amyloid itself, may be a major culprit in the disease. The theory holds that an amyloid-related mechanism that prunes neuronal connections in the brain in the fast-growth phase of early life may be triggered by ageing-related processes in later life to cause the neuronal <b>withering</b> of Alzheimer's disease. N-APP, a fragment of APP from the peptide's N-terminus, is adjacent to beta-amyloid and is cleaved from APP {{by one of the}} same enzymes. N-APP triggers the self-destruct pathway by binding to a neuronal receptor called death receptor 6 (DR6, also known as TNFRSF21). DR6 is highly expressed in the human brain regions most affected by Alzheimer's, so {{it is possible that the}} N-APP/DR6 pathway might be hijacked in the ageing brain to cause damage. In this model, beta-amyloid plays a complementary role, by depressing synaptic function.|$|E

5|$|On {{the right}} flank, Pickett's Virginians crossed the Emmitsburg road and wheeled {{partially}} to their left to face northeast. They marched in two lines, {{led by the}} brigades of Brig. Gen. James L. Kemper {{on the right and}} Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett on the left; Brig. Gen. Lewis A. Armistead's brigade followed closely behind. As the division wheeled to the left, its right flank was exposed to McGilvery's guns and the front of Doubleday's Union division on Cemetery Ridge. Stannard's Vermont Brigade marched forward, faced north, and delivered <b>withering</b> fire into the rear of Kemper's brigade. At about this time, Hancock, who had been prominent in displaying himself on horseback to his men during the Confederate artillery bombardment, was wounded by a bullet striking the pommel of his saddle, entering his inner right thigh along with wood fragments and a large bent nail. He refused evacuation to the rear until the battle was settled.|$|E
5|$|Over Romney Marsh Nos. 41, 92 and 222 Squadrons engaged JG 26, {{losing one}} of their number to the Bf 109s. The second wave of RAF fighters arrived on the scene, {{comprising}} 607 and 213 Squadrons with 23 Hurricanes. They initiated a head-on attack against the Do 17s of KG 3. A Hurricane and a Dornier collided, both going down. The Bf 109s {{did their best to}} break up attacks and the bombers held a tight formation, putting up <b>withering</b> cross-fire. The Bf 109s were not permitted to leave the bombers and chase enemy fighters. Time and again, they were forced to break off and return to the bomber stream, allowing the RAF fighters to return and repeat the process. Soon after, No. 605 and No. 501 Squadron arrived with 14 Hurricanes. One fighter was hit by return fire, but the pilot aimed his aircraft at a Dornier and bailed out. The fighter collided and destroyed the bomber. The German bomber crews {{had no way of knowing}} that the crashes were not premeditated. It seemed as if the British were desperate. Nevertheless, they thought the 'tactic' was devastatingly effective. Chastened by losses, the Dorniers closed ranks to snuff out the gaps and continued to their target.|$|E
5|$|The French {{position}} {{was such that}} they were able to lay down <b>withering</b> fire on the British forces as they advanced, and the abatis (a word that shares derivation with abattoir, or slaughterhouse) rapidly became a killing field. By about 2 pm, it was clear that the first wave of attack had failed. Montcalm was active on the battlefield, having removed his coat, and was moving among his men, giving encouragement and making sure all of their needs were being met. Abercrombie, who was reported by early historians like Francis Parkman and Thomas Mante to be at the sawmill (and thus well away from the action), was reported by his aide, James Abercrombie, to be near the rear of the lines by the La Chute River during much of the battle, and to have approached the front of the French lines at one point early in the battle. It is uncertain why, after the first wave of attack failed, Abercrombie persisted in ordering further attacks. Writing in his own defense, he later claimed that he was relying on Clerk's assessment that the works could be easily taken; this was clearly refuted by the failure of the first charge.|$|E

25|$|<b>Withering</b> {{was born}} in Wellington, Shropshire, {{the son of a}} surgeon. He trained as a {{physician}} and studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. He worked at Birmingham General Hospital from 1779. The story is that he noticed a person with dropsy (swelling from congestive heart failure) improve remarkably after taking a traditional herbal remedy; <b>Withering</b> became famous for recognising that the active ingredient in the mixture came from the foxglove plant. The active ingredient is now known as digitalis, after the plant's scientific name. In 1785, <b>Withering</b> published An Account of the Foxglove and some of its Medical Uses, which contained reports on clinical trials and notes on digitalis's effects and toxicity.|$|E
