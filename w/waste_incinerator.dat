5|$|Teesside Energy from Waste plant (also {{known as}} Teesside WTE power station or Haverton Hill incinerator) is a {{municipal}} <b>waste</b> <b>incinerator</b> and waste-to-energy power station, which provides 29.2 megawatts (MW) of electricity for the National Grid by burning 390,000 tonnes of household and commercial waste a year. It {{is located on}} the River Tees at Haverton Hill, east of Billingham in North East England. Operated by SITA UK since its conception, the plant replaced the Portrack Incinerator and opened in 1998.|$|E

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarEmission {{measurements}} at 4 Dutch hospital <b>waste</b> <b>incinerators</b> show dioxin {{concentrations in}} the flue-gas from 70 to 460 ng I-TEQ/m 3 (101, 3 kPa, 273 degrees K, dry 11 % O 2). The emission of dioxins from hospital <b>waste</b> <b>incinerators</b> is high compared with the emission of dioxins from Dutch municipal <b>waste</b> <b>incinerators.</b> Hospital <b>waste</b> was incinerated in the Netherlands by about 25 hospitals in august 1991. The quantity of hospital waste incinerated in the Netherlands by hospitals, for the situation till august 1991, was about 4275 tons/year. The emission of dioxins caused by the incineration of this waste was about 5 g I-TEQ/year. With reference {{to the results of}} the measurements 3 of the 4 measured hospital <b>waste</b> <b>incinerators</b> are closed now, the 4 th installation was already closed before the results of the measurements became known. The quantity of hospital waste incinerated by hospitals is decreased to about 675 tons/year in june 1992. By closing these installation the emission of dioxins by hospital <b>waste</b> <b>incinerators</b> is decreased to 2 g I-TEQ/year in june 1992...|$|R
40|$|The Health Protection Agency has {{reviewed}} research {{undertaken to}} examine the suggested links between emissions from municipal <b>waste</b> <b>incinerators</b> and effects on health. While {{it is not possible}} to rule out adverse health effects from modern, well regulated municipal <b>waste</b> <b>incinerators</b> with complete certainty, any potential damage to the health of those living close-by is likely to be very small, if detectable. This view is based on detailed assessments of the effects of air pollutants on health and on the fact that modern and well managed municipal <b>waste</b> <b>incinerators</b> make only a very small contribution to local concentrations of air pollutants. The Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment has reviewed recent data and has concluded that there is no need to change its previous advice, namely that any potential risk of cancer due to residency near to municipal <b>waste</b> <b>incinerators</b> is exceedingly low and probably not measurable by the most modern techniques. Since any possible health effects are likely to be very small, if detectable, studies of public health around modern, well managed municipal <b>waste</b> <b>incinerators</b> are not recommended. The Agency's role is to provide expert advice on public health matters to Government, stakeholders and the public. The regulation of municipal <b>waste</b> <b>incinerators</b> is the responsibility of the Environment Agency...|$|R

25|$|On 5 January 2012 the Nambu (south) Clean Center, a <b>waste</b> <b>incinerator</b> in Kashiwa, Chiba, {{was taken}} out of {{production}} by the city council because the storage room was completely filled with 200 metric tons of radioactive ash that could not disposed of in landfills. Storage at the plant was full, with 1049 drums, and some 30 tons more were still to be taken out of the incinerator. In September 2011, the factory was closed for two months for the same reason. The Center's special advanced procedures were able to minimize the volume of the ash, but radioactive cesium was concentrated to levels above the national limit of 8.000 becquerels per kilogram for waste disposal in landfills. It was not possible to secure new storage space for the radioactive ash. Radiation levels in Kashiwa were higher than in surrounding areas, and ashes containing up to 70,800 becquerels of radioactive cesium per kilogram – higher than the national limit – were detected in the city. Other cities around Kashiwa were facing the same problem: radioactive ash was piling up. Chiba prefecture asked Abiko and Inzai to accept temporary storage at the Teganuma waste-disposal facility located at their border. But this met strong opposition from their citizens.|$|E

40|$|The {{public health}} impacts {{associated}} with stack emissions from hazardous <b>waste</b> <b>incinerators</b> {{have become a}} major concern in recent years. Most evaluations of incinerator stack emissions have focused on three classes of compounds: metals, semivolatile, and volatile compounds.

The results of over 20 trial burns at hazardous <b>waste</b> <b>incinerators</b> were assembled in an attempt to determine which compounds may pose a significant threat to the public health. The risks associated with semivolatile emissions were found to be inconsequential, although further study of dioxins and dibenzofurans emissions appears to be warranted. The risk associated with the emission of cadmium and perhaps chromium (VI) may pose a significant risk to public health at certain facilities. Controls on waste feed or air pollution control devices should be employed to reduce the emission of these metals.
