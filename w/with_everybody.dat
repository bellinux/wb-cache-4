5|$|The {{series was}} {{originally}} {{developed as a}} vehicle and sitcom debut for Shannen Doherty under the working title Wingwoman. Though picked up by UPN, Doherty {{was removed from the}} project {{at the request of the}} network due to her poor reception by preview audiences; she was replaced by Philipps. The show was set in New York City, but filming took place at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles and other locations in California. It included contemporary hip hop music and was promoted heavily by UPN to attract an urban audience, and to that end it was paired <b>with</b> <b>Everybody</b> Hates Chris as its lead-in on Thursday nights.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{were held}} {{during the second}} wave of strikes, when Brendan Barber {{announced}} {{on the afternoon of}} Friday 30 October that proposals had been put to both Royal Mail and the CWU for them to consider over the weekend. Talks resumed on the Monday, however this news was overshadowed by the announcement that a further two days of strikes would be held on Friday 6 November and Monday 9 November. It was also announced that these would be all out strikes <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> walking out at the same time rather than the rolling strike action that had been adopted previously, thus leading to a complete stoppage throughout the course of the action. These were later called off in order for further talks to take place.|$|E
25|$|Jones and Taylor resumed on {{the second}} morning <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> {{watching}} {{to see if the}} young New South Wales batsman Taylor, could add the four runs he needed for his maiden Test century and he did not disappoint, bringing up his ton shortly after the resumption. It was not the most glamorous of centuries, but filled the young batsman with the confidence he needed to secure his place in the team for much of the next decade. Jones and Taylor batted throughout the morning taking Australia to 273 for 4 when Taylor was finally dismissed for 136.|$|E

25|$|Franklin Howard Scobey (May 27, 1837 – July 22, 1888) {{was born}} in Hamilton, Ohio. Scobey was {{considered}} The Spirit of Sigma Chi for being friendly <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> {{and not just a}} select group of people. After graduating from Miami University in 1858 he went on to graduate again in 1861 with a law degree. He worked as a journalist in his hometown until 1879 but {{went on to become a}} cattleman in Kansas until 1882. Scobey then moved back to Ohio where he took up farming until his death. Never physically robust, Scobey was afflicted with hearing loss in his final years.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} the band had split, Ashcroft had already been working on solo {{material}} accompanied by, among others, Salisbury and Cole. In 2000, he released his first solo album, Alone <b>with</b> <b>Everybody,</b> which reached number 1 in the UK album charts. Ashcroft's next album Human Conditions was released to poorer sales in 2002, and Ashcroft was subsequently absent from the music business for several years. During this time Salisbury was the drummer for Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's UK tour in 2004, after their original drummer briefly left due to alcohol and drug abuse. Salisbury also owns a drum shop in Stockport. Ashcroft appeared with Coldplay at Live 8 in 2005, followed by the release of Keys to the World in 2006 and a particularly successful tour that included gigs as the support act for Coldplay's Twisted Logic Tour.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of powerful businesswomen—still a rare sight—in {{some of these}} groups helps get them heard. Prior to 2008, women {{were not allowed to}} enter hotels and furnished apartments without a chaperon or mahram. With a 2008 Royal Decree, however, the only requirement for a woman to be allowed to enter hotels is a national ID card, and the hotel must inform the nearest police station of their room reservation and length of stay; however, this happens <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> staying in the hotel. In April 2010, a new, optional ID card for women was issued which allows them to travel in countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The cards include GPS tracking, fingerprints and features that make them difficult to forge. Women do not need male permission to apply for the card, but do need it to travel abroad. Proponents argue that new female identity cards enable a woman to carry out her activities with ease, and prevent forgeries committed in the name of women.|$|E

25|$|In (36a), {{the empty}} pronoun ø {{is able to}} refer to any entity. However, the {{preferred}} reading is {{for it to be}} interpreted as a variable bound to the quantifier mei ge ren (or everyone). In contrast, the ta (he) in sentence (36b) is unable to have a bound variable interpretation, and must be interpreted as referring to some other third party. Huang states that this is because the empty pronoun construction (36a) is possible, and so it is preferred as the construction that carries the bound variable interpretation. This explanation is made as an extension of a claim put forward by Chomsky in his theory of anaphora, which states that where empty pronouns and overt pronouns are both able {{to be used as a}} reference, languages will prefer to use the empty pronoun. This implies that, since English does not have an empty pronoun available in the above examples, the overt pronoun he is used to refer to the quantifier everybody. However, since the empty pronoun is available in Mandarin, using it is preferred when the pronoun in the sentence is meant to corefer <b>with</b> <b>everybody,</b> as in (36a).|$|E
500|$|Csupó {{said that}} they cast Bailee Madison as May Belle Aarons after weeks of searching for an actress to play the part. He {{went on to say}} that [...] "she had such a charm, even before the camera, she was just like a little sweetheart. She was very confident, she showed up, shook hands <b>with</b> <b>everybody,</b> totally sweet and perky. I said 'WOW!'— she was just {{stealing}} everybody's heart on the spot." ...|$|E

When Baffert brought American Pharoah out of the Belmont Park barn, he invited the assembled media to come over and pet the horse. [...] "I wanted to share him <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> and show everybody how kind and sweet he is," [...] said Baffert, while the group of about 30 people touched and even kissed the horse. The horse then posed quietly with Baffert and Espinoza to tape a segment for The Today Show, standing between the two men who were seated in folding director's chairs.|$|E

500|$|A {{representative}} from Ceres {{stated that the}} implosion would shorten the demolition process by some six weeks and would save money. Costs were around NZ$1m for the implosion, compared to some NZ$1.2m for a conventional demolition, with the owner's building insurance covering the costs. The owner of the building, however, stated that the implosion was not a cheaper option for his company than a conventional demolition, but it [...] "would save others thousands". He likened the consent process to Christopher Columbus wanting to sail to America, <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> telling him {{that it could not}} be done.|$|E
500|$|The {{directors}} cast Nielsen for {{his ability}} to play like [...] "a fish in water", saying [...] "You could have cast funny people and done it <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> winking, goofing off, and silly... we wanted people to be oblivious to the comedy." [...] For Nielsen, Airplane! marked a shift from dramatic roles to deadpan comedy. When it was suggested his role in Airplane! was against type, Nielsen protested that he had [...] "always been cast against type before", and that comedy was what he always wanted to do. The same directors cast Nielsen in a similar style, in their TV series Police Squad!. The series introduced Nielsen as Frank Drebin, the stereotypical police officer modelled after serious characters in earlier police series.|$|E
500|$|The album {{represented}} {{a departure from}} the band's previous working methods: although all five members had always contributed {{to the development of the}} songs, Gruff Rhys had been the main songwriter. On Love Kraft this was no longer the case, as Rhys, Huw Bunford, Dafydd Ieuan and Cian Ciaran all contributed songs and lead vocals. The group also abandoned their usual practise of picking songs on their individual merit, instead choosing tracks that would work well together and [...] "create a sound that was as cohesive as possible". Of the [...] "30-40" [...] songs written by band members the group chose [...] "the more introspective ones" [...] which meant that some of Rhys's tracks were left off the album as they were [...] "energetic and poppy" [...] and [...] "didn't really fit in <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> else's work".|$|E

500|$|In October 2012 {{during an}} interview, Milian spoke of her Young Money debut: [...] "Wayne just gets his artists, which is great, I {{have a very}} {{one-on-one}} business relationship <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> from Mack Maine to Wayne. They're just very {{involved in the project}} as far as bringing the music, playing songs, just giving their input. [...] I really want to pick the perfect single though. It's been a second since I've been out musically, so I do not want to fail and I don't believe in failure, so I just try new things and figure out the pieces. That's one thing that's great about Wayne. He's like, 'Work with different producers, take your time, but at the same time, try new things. Don't be stuck on one thing.'" [...] In July 2013, it was discovered that her contract with The Voice would be ended.|$|E
500|$|In 1955, limited {{integration}} came to heavily segregated Las Vegas {{when the}} Sands first allowed Nat King Cole {{to stay at}} the hotel and perform. Sinatra noticed that he never saw Cole in the dining room, always eating his meals in solitude in his dressing room. When he asked his valet George to find out why, he learned that [...] "Coloreds aren't allowed in the dining room at the Sands". Sinatra subsequently saw to it that if blacks were not permitted to eat their meals in the dining room <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> else he would see to it that all of the waiters and waitresses were fired, and invited Cole to dine with him the following evening. Cole was allowed permission into the casino, as was another black performer, Harry Belafonte, who took a more aggressive approach by walking into the casino on his own accord and sitting at a blackjack table, which was not challenged by the bosses. Belafonte became the [...] "first black man to play cards on the Las Vegas Strip".|$|E
500|$|On August 6, 2005, UPN officially ordered {{thirteen}} {{episodes of}} the series. The network later ordered {{a full season}} of twenty-two episodes of the show on November 7, 2005, amid speculation {{that it would be}} canceled. In 2006, LivingTV broadcast the series in the United Kingdom, and it was broadcast by Nelonen in Sweden in 2008. UPN paired the series <b>with</b> <b>Everybody</b> Hates Chris, Eve, and Cuts to attract an [...] "urban" [...] audience. The network moved WWE SmackDown to Fridays in favor of scheduling Thursdays as focused on sitcoms. This decision was made to establish a [...] "night of scripted programming" [...] and to attract more advertising from film studios to promote upcoming releases. Today questioned the network's belief that Love, Inc. and Everybody Hates Chris would appeal to the same viewership, and noted the difference in quality between the two, with Love, Inc. cited as the inferior show. While the series retained 59% of the audience from Everybody Hates Chris initially, this marketing strategy proved unsuccessful when it lost a majority of the viewership in later episodes.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the decade, Finberg {{had moved}} away from lo-fi {{recordings}} made by himself to studio-productions. In 2010, the band released their seventh album, Males.

500|$|Ryan Stiles won {{the role}} of [...] "hapless janitor" [...] Lewis Kiniski. Despite being well known for his role on the British improve show Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Stiles still {{had to go through}} the {{audition}} process along <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> else. He said, [...] "I don't even think Drew was really even aware of Whose Line at that time because it hadn't been on the air (in the U.S.) that many years. I think it was only on Comedy Central at that time." [...] Stiles admitted that he liked to have fun with his character and not psychoanalyze him. Following his appearance in The Beverly Hillbillies, Diedrich Bader realised he needed a regular income and decided to return to television. He tested out for The Drew Carey Show, but did not initially want to be cast in it. He told Kevin Smith that he wanted to drive up his price for the pilot of Partners. Bader lost out on {{the role of}} Bob to Jon Cryer and then learned The Drew Carey Show wanted to hire him to play Oswald Lee Harvey.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was directed by}} Philipp Stölzl and it was filmed in Los Angeles, California in mid-April 2004. Talking about the filming {{and the development of}} the video, Lee said: [...] "There's this one scene <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> on motorbikes that every time I see it I just crack up. It's the slow-mo scene where I take off the helmet and swoosh my hair and look at the camera ... and it kills me. It's so hilarious, it's ridiculous. [...] It's a really different thing for us to do because it's not performance at all. Everybody was laughing at me the whole time. I was just like, 'Please don't laugh at me. Just give me five minutes so I can do this.'" [...] Lee added that the message of the video is {{in the name of the}} products her character is advertising, each of which are called [...] "Lies" [...] because according to her [...] " [...] whole life is a lie.

500|$|Eva Birthistle plays Captain Kate Marshall, a [...] "crack commando" [...] {{who oversees}} Section 20's {{military}} personnel. She and Stonebridge have an affair. The actress {{was taken by}} the script, and although she was cast for the role, she had not done action in her past acting career, and felt it would be a [...] "fun experience" [...] to play the character. When Birthistle went through military training, her goal was [...] "just to keep up <b>with</b> <b>everybody</b> and not give up, pass out, throw up or cry." [...] Rhashan Stone plays Major Oliver Sinclair, Grant's right-hand man who helps her gather intelligence. Mealing called their working relationship as [...] "very strong" [...] and [...] "simpatico." [...] Sinclair is the section's second-in-command. Michelle Lukes plays Sergeant Julia Richmond, one of the newer recruits of Section 20.

Jimi Mistry plays the antagonist Latif, the terrorist mastermind behind Project Dawn. Richard Armitage returns as John Porter, the protagonist of the original Strike Back series, in the first episode.
