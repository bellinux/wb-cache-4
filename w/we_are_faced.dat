The problem <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>faced</b> with now, he claims, is that we have a bureaucratic system of distribution that provides lower quality service and prohibits the involvement of civil society in the provision of public services. The alternative he lays out is to have the state act to equip civil society to partake in public services and care. This would entail empowering each individual to have two responsibilities, one in the productive economy and one in the caring economy.|$|E

500|$|Since its release, Memento {{has been}} a widely noted topic of film discussion, both for its unique {{narrative}} structure and themes. Those searching for explanations of the film's plot have either resorted to online forums, message boards or scholarly material, or have ignored the film's official website and forums {{in order to maintain}} their own personal hypotheses. In an article for The Dissolve analyzing Nolan's work, Mike D'Angelo cites Memento as [...] "a masterful study in deliberate self-delusion," [...] alluding to Leonard's own actions {{towards the end of the}} film and his role as an unreliable narrator. On the same topic of self-deception, James Mooney of filmandphilosophy.com notes that the film suggests how [...] "our memories deceive us, or rather, sometimes we deceive ourselves by ‘choosing’ to forget or by manipulating our memories of past events." [...] This is much in line with a psychological analysis of the film, specifically the act of confabulation. Leonard's use of confabulation poses the dilemma, as explained by SUNY Downstate Medical Center Professor John Kubie for BrainFacts.org: [...] "In Memento <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>faced</b> with the question of how much of Leonard's memory of the past is real and how much constructed from beliefs and wishes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>faced</b> {{with a very}} {{convoluted}} narrative, García Márquez is able {{to define}} clear themes while maintaining individual character identities, and using different narrative techniques such as third-person narrators, specific point of view narrators, and streams of consciousness.

Lastly, through human comedy the problems of a family, a town, and a country are unveiled. [...] This is all presented through García Márquez's unique form of narration, which causes the novel to never cease being at its most interesting point.|$|E

2500|$|In our {{schematic}} example above, {{we concluded}} that M causes M∗ by causing P∗. So M causes P∗. Now, M, as an emergent, must itself have an emergence base property, say P. Now we face a critical question: if an emergent, M, emerges from basal condition P, why cannot P displace M {{as a cause of}} any putative effect of M? Why cannot P do all the work in explaining why any alleged effect of M occurred? If causation is understood as nomological (law-based) sufficiency, P, as M’s emergence base, is nomologically sufficient for it, and M, as P∗’s cause, is nomologically sufficient for P∗. It follows that P is nomologically sufficient for P∗ and hence qualifies as its cause…If M is somehow retained as a cause, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>faced</b> with the highly implausible consequence that every case of downward causation involves [...] overdetermination (since P remains a cause of P∗ as well).

But increased choice can be both liberating and troubling. Liberating in the sense of increasing the likelihood of one's self-fulfilment, and troubling in form of increased emotional stress and time needed to analyse the available choices and minimise risk of which we are increasingly aware (what Giddens sums up as [...] "manufacturing uncertainty").

2500|$|After Goschen {{left the}} meeting, Bethmann Hollweg {{received}} {{a message from}} Prince Lichnowsky saying that Grey was most anxious for a four power conference, but that if Germany attacked France, then Britain would have no other choice but {{to intervene in the}} war. In response to the British warning, Bethmann Hollweg suddenly changed course. As he wrote to Prince Tschirschky: [...] "If therefore, Austria should reject all mediation, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>faced</b> with a conflagration in which Britain would be against us, Italy and Romania in all probability not with us. We should be two Powers against Four. With Britain an enemy, the weight of the operations would fall on Germany... Under these circumstances we must urgently and emphatically suggest to the Vienna Cabinet acceptance of mediation under the present honourable conditions. The responsibility falling on us and Austria for the consequences which would ensure in case of refusal would be uncommonly heavy." [...] Five minutes later, Bethmann Hollweg asked Vienna in a second message to stop [...] "refusing any exchange of views with Russia", and warned that they [...] "must refuse to allow Vienna to draw us into a world conflagration frivolously and without regard to our advice." [...] In another message, Bethmann Hollweg wrote [...] "To avert a general catastrophe or in any case to put Russia in the wrong, we must urgently wish Vienna to begin and continue conversations with Russia." [...] As the historian Fritz Fischer noted, only when Bethmann Hollweg received a clear warning that Britain would intervene in a war did he begin to apply pressure on Austria for peace. Bethmann Hollweg's advice was rejected by Austria as being too late. Count Berchtold told the German Ambassador that he would need a few days to think about the German offer, and until then, events would proceed.|$|E
2500|$|During the trial, Evans was cross-examined by Irving. The {{cross-examination}} of Evans by Irving {{was noted}} {{for the high}} degree of personal antagonism between the two men. Such was the degree of antagonism that Irving challenged Evans on very minor points, such as Evans doubting that a 1938 German plebiscite in which the Nazi regime received 98.8% of the vote was fair. A subject that much engaged Irving and Evans in a debate was a 1942 memo by the Chief of the Reich Chancellory Hans Lammers to the Reich Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger in which Lammers wrote that Hitler ordered him to put the [...] "Jewish Question" [...] on the [...] "back-burner" [...] until after the war. Evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by Eberhard Jäckel in the 1970s; Irving chose to interpret the memo literally, and taunted Evans, saying [...] "t is a terrible problem, is it not, that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>faced</b> with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun, and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item {{that we do not have}} to interpret or read between the lines of, but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents which... quite clearly specifically show Hitler intervening in the other sense?". In response, Evans stated [...] "No, I do not accept that at all. It is because you want to interpret euphemisms as being literal and that is what the whole problem is. Every time there is an euphemism, Mr. Irving... or a camouflage piece of statement or language about Madagascar, you want to treat it as the literal truth, because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate Hitler.
