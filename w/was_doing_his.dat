In the following months, many of his reforms began to have a positive effect; and his ratings began to improve, and his approval rebounded.|$|E

His uncles were Jack Milburn (Leeds United and Bradford City), George Milburn (Leeds United and Chesterfield), Jim Milburn (Leeds United and Bradford Park Avenue) and Stan Milburn (Chesterfield, Leicester City and Rochdale), and legendary Newcastle United and England footballer Jackie Milburn was his mother's cousin.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} office, Cleveland {{was faced with}} the task of filling all the {{government}} jobs for which the president had the power of appointment. These jobs were typically filled under the spoils system, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> job well, and would not appoint anyone {{solely on the basis of}} party service. He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers. Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats.; this was especially the case with policy making positions. While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.|$|E

25|$|The French fleet, {{on course}} to {{approach}} the coasts of Galicia, captured two Spanish merchant ships, an error which alerted the Governor at the time, Don Sancho de Leyva, who immediately sent emissaries to Bazán warning {{of the presence of}} the fleet and its course. Bazán, having been detached from his army and especially the soldiers sent to Flanders at that time, <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> best to finish fitting out his ships, as he only had at his disposal a few thousand soldiers. Reading the messages of Leiva, he sent for reinforcements, and was quickly reinforced with 500 arquebusiers.|$|E
25|$|Pratt {{was just}} 16 {{when he made}} his {{first-class}} cricket debut for Leicestershire in 1955, and only 17 when he took 10 Somerset wickets for a total of 60 runs in a match in 1956. But after this promising start he largely disappeared from county cricket for the next three seasons, making only occasional appearances for Leicestershire while he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> National Service, but playing also in a handful of first-class games for the Combined Services cricket team. In one of those occasional Leicestershire games in the summer of 1959 he revealed hitherto unseen batting skills: it was his 19th first-class game, and his innings of 80 against Essex was a bigger total than all of his previous innings combined, and was to remain his highest score.|$|E
25|$|Yorkshire {{finished}} third in the County Championship, twenty points adrift of the joint winners Lancashire and Surrey. For the most part, Yorkshire selected from 15 players in 1950 although a few others made occasional appearances. Yardley captained the team in which Hutton and Lowson were the established openers although, with Hutton's Test calls, there were more opportunities for Halliday and Geoffrey Keighley. Lester, Watson, Wilson and Billy Sutcliffe were the other batsmen and Brennan was the wicket-keeper. The main bowlers were Wardle, Coxon and Eddie Leadbeater. Brian Close <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> national service and could only make a single appearance, Ellis Robinson had departed and Ron Aspinall's career had been wrecked by his injury. So Trueman and Whitehead, who made 13 appearances, contested the fourth bowling place but one of the bit players was Bob Appleyard, who would make a major impact in 1951.|$|E

25|$|In 1279, the Yuan Dynasty had {{the decisive}} {{victory over the}} Song Dynasty in the Battle of Yamen- trận Nhai Sơn, which {{marked the end of}} the Song Dynasty and the total control of Kublai Khan over China. As a result, Kublai Khan began to expose his attempt to take over the {{southern}} countries like Đại Việt or Champa. Facing the threat from northern border, in October 1282, the retired Emperor Trần Thánh Tông and the Emperor Trần Nhân Tông gathered all members of royal family, Trần clan and officials in royal court in Bình Than to discuss about the unavoidable war. Incidentally, the Emperor met Trần Khánh Dư, who <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> business near the meeting place and since ordered an issue to pardon Trấn Khánh Dư's guilt and permitted him to participate in the Trần Dynasty's preparation for the war of resistance. Trần Khánh Dư was soon appointed as general of Trần's army under grand commander Trần Hưng Đạo.|$|E
25|$|Next was a Last Man Standing {{match between}} Kane and Shane McMahon. Before the match began, McMahon {{attacked}} Kane, who <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> entrance, with a steel chair. As the referee officially called {{to ring the}} bell to start the match, Kane pushed McMahon away to block another chair shot. After multiple shots with the chair, McMahon targeted Kane's knee using the ring post. Later, Kane attempted to perform a big boot on McMahon, but he accidentally hit the referee. After back and forth action, Kane attempted a Tombstone Piledriver onto the steel steps on McMahon but McMahon countered into a bulldog and performed a Coast-to-Coast into the steel steps, which were positioned against Kane. In the end, McMahon attempted a Leap of Faith, {{from the top of}} the arena TitanTron, which was roughly 25 feet tall. but Kane moved and McMahon fell through the floor. Kane won the match when McMahon did not stand up in time to answer the referee's 10 count.|$|E

500|$|Foraker was not {{actively}} involved in the controversy, and in the sole interview he gave, said he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> best to keep out of it. [...] Nevertheless, most of Hanna's Republican opponents were from Foraker's wing of the party. [...] Ohio's senior senator did, however, state his belief that Hanna would have a difficult time being elected. When asked by Hanna supporters to intercede with the insurgents, Foraker responded, [...] "I will not antagonize lifetime friends for Hanna," [...] and that Hanna was [...] "not honorable enough" [...] to go to Bushnell and Kurtz and work out a solution.|$|E
500|$|In 1987, the Pixies {{released}} an 18-track demo tape, {{commonly referred to}} as The Purple Tape. Thompson's father assisted the band financially, loaning $1,000 in order to record the demo tape; Thompson later said that his father [...] "wasn't around for a lot of my younger years, so I think he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> best {{to make up for lost}} time." [...] The Purple Tape led to a recording contract with the English independent record label 4AD.

500|$|Soon {{after its}} release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, {{and moved to}} Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers in the {{development}} of soundtracks for film. The loss of his key mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake to further retreat into depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered that [...] "Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> song 'Fruit Tree' and walked off halfway through it.

500|$|McCartney {{said about}} the line [...] "I'd love to turn you on", which concludes both verse sections: [...] "This was the time of Tim Leary's 'Turn on, tune in, drop out' and we wrote, 'I'd love to turn you on.' John and I gave each other a knowing look: 'Uh-huh, it's a drug song. You know that, don't you?'" [...] George Martin commented that he had always {{suspected}} that the line [...] "found my way upstairs and had a smoke" [...] was a drug reference, recalling how the Beatles would [...] "disappear and have a little puff", presumably of marijuana, but {{not in front of}} him. [...] "When [...] <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> TV programme on Pepper", McCartney recalled later, [...] "he asked me, 'Do you know what caused Pepper?' I said, 'In one word, George, drugs. Pot.' And George said, 'No, no. But you weren't on it all the time.' 'Yes, we were.' Sgt. Pepper was a drug album." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{it became}} clear that the King was losing the Civil War, and only Oxford held out, Hale decided to act as a {{commissioner}} to negotiate its surrender, fearing that the city might otherwise be destroyed. Thanks to his intercession, honourable terms were reached, and the libraries preserved. Despite practising in the politically charged environment of the English Civil War and primarily defending opponents of the resulting Commonwealth of England, Hale's reputation did not suffer. First, he largely kept out of the war, even ignoring news of its progress, and instead translating The Life and Death of Pomponious Atticus into English. Second, he was acknowledged as universally able and of high integrity during his cases, retorting to those who complained of his defence of the Royalists that he was [...] "pleading in defence of the laws which they professed they would maintain and preserve; and that he <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>his</b> duty to his client and was not to be daunted by such threatenings".|$|E
