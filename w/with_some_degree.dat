5|$|Although {{there are}} many Cortinarius species <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> of violet colour, C.violaceus and its close {{relatives}} are easily distinguished by their much darker purple colour. Cortinarius iodes of the southeastern United States has a slimy purple cap and paler violet stipe. The other species in the section Cortinarius are dark purple and superficially similar, but can be differentiated based on host and geography as they do not occur in the same locations as C. violaceus. Certain Leptonia species in northwestern North America, including L. carnea and L. nigroviolacea, have a similar color, but are easily differentiated due to their pink spore print.|$|E
5|$|W5 {{is found}} in Thoroughbreds {{descending}} from Puchilingui, a 1984 stallion with sabino-like white spotting and roaning. Horses with the W5 allele exhibit a huge range in white phenotype: a few have been pure white or near-white, while others have sabino-like spotting limited to high, irregular stockings and blazes that covered the face. Twenty-two members of this family were studied, and the 12 <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>degree</b> of dominant white spotting {{were found to have}} a deletion in exon 15 (p.T732QfsX9), {{in the form of a}} frameshift mutation. A later study found that the members of this family with the greatest depigmentation were compound heterozygotes who also carried the W20 allele.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{main purpose}} of this paper is to compare and {{contrast}} the treatment of vowel harmony, a kind of long-distance assimilatory phonological process involving vowels, in Turkey's Turkish and Azerbaijani Turkish (Iran). Examining carefully the linguistic data obtained from the dialects and within the framework of generative phonology, the author of the paper has attempted to evaluate the present-day situation of vowel harmony (a synchronic study) in the above- mentioned members of Oghuz languages. The results of the study showed that, except some violations mostly observed in loanwords, there is an innate and high degree of harmony in both of them, along <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>degrees</b> of disharmony. It can be claimed that one of the main factors of the observed disharmony, among other factors, is the effect of other languages and the existence of loanwords. Generally speaking, we may conclude that vowel harmony is one of the most active and prominent phonological rules both in Turkey's Turkish and Azerbaijani Turkish (Iran), of course <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>degrees</b> of difference...|$|R

The authors produced fibers from electrospun solutions of LiF, ferrocene and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) {{which were then}} heat-treated in two steps: a first annealing at 280  °C in air for 5  h followed by a carbonization at 900  °C (8  h under Ar). The resulting composite yielded freestanding and flexible electrodes <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>degrees</b> of 3 D structuration. Electrochemical tests were conducted in the window 4.2 – 0.5  V versus Li+/Li resulting in around 400 mAh·g− 1 delivered after 50 cycles (current density of 0.05  °C) even if a marked tendency to performance degradation can be observed after the 30 th cycle.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Interval {{arithmetic}} (IA) {{can enhance}} vector quantiza-tion (VQ) in image-compression applications. In the interval arith-metic vector quantization (IAVQ) reformulation of classical VQ, prototypes assume ranges of admissible locations {{instead of being}} clamped to specific space positions. This provides the VQ-recon-struction process <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>degrees</b> of freedom, which do not af-fect the overall compression ratio, but help make up for coarse dis-cretization effects. In image compression, IA attenuates artifacts (such as blockiness) {{brought about by the}} VQ schema. This paper describes the algorithms for both the training and the run-time use of IAVQ. Data-driven training endows the methodology with the adaptiveness of standard VQ methods, as confirmed by exper-imental results on real images. Index Terms—Author, please supply index terms.

Major encounter over subsequently decade will be to identify policies and solutions that would permit marketplace economy to flourish in the framework of this intellectual property insurrection. There has been a lot of dispute on the role of intellectual property protection regime specially in fostering innovation, technology development of a country. IPRs are expected to emboli the innovation, by rewarding inventor with a grant of domination rights over the mercantile exploitation for a specified time period.
