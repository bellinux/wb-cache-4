5|$|Anna Maria Luisa's {{single most}} {{enduring}} act <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> Pact. It ensured {{that all the}} Medicean art and treasures collected over nearly three centuries of political ascendancy remained in Florence. Cynthia Miller Lawrence, an American art-historian, argues that Anna Maria Luisa thus provisioned for Tuscany's future economy through tourism. Sixteen years after her death, the Uffizi Gallery, built by Cosimo the Great, {{the founder of the}} Grand Duchy, was made open to public viewing.|$|E

5|$|King {{was born}} in Philadelphia in 1873. Early in his life, he worked in a linen trade. Although this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> business, his father later allowed him to leave to enter the {{insurance}} industry. King was {{not a member of}} the aristocratic and wealthy families of Philadelphia that produced many of the era's top cricketers. King's obituary in Cricket Quarterly suggests that his career in insurance was set up for him by those families to allow him to continue playing the game. In 1913 (or 1911), King married Fannie Lockhart; the marriage lasted for fifty years. King's wife died in 1963, and he died in 1965 in his native Philadelphia two days before his 92nd birthday.|$|E
5|$|Over its 950 {{years of}} history Warwick Castle has been owned by 36 {{different}} individuals, plus four periods as crown property under seven different monarchs. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> seat of three separate creations of the Earls of Warwick, {{and has been a}} family home for members of the Beaumont, Beauchamp, Neville, Plantagenet, Dudley and Greville families. The first creation of the Earldom specifically included the right of inheritance through the female line, so the castle three times had a woman (or girl) as the owner. Eleven of the owners were under 20 when they inherited, including a girl aged two and a boy aged three. At least three owners died in battle, two were executed and one murdered. Every century except the 21st has seen major building work or adaptations at the castle.|$|E

5|$|Two subfamilies, Hydrobatinae and Oceanitinae, were {{recognized}} in the past within a single large family Hydrobatidae but this has since been split with the elevation of Oceanitidae to family status. The Oceanitinae, or austral storm petrels, were mostly found in southern waters (though Wilson's storm petrel regularly migrates into the northern hemisphere); there were seven species in five genera. The Hydrobatinae, or northern storm petrels, were the two genera Hydrobates and Oceanodroma. They were largely restricted to the northern hemisphere, although a few visit or breed a short distance south of the equator. Cytochrome b DNA sequence analysis suggested that the family was paraphyletic and more accurately treated as two distinct families. The same {{study found that the}} austral storm petrels are basal within Procellariiformes. The first split <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> Oceanitidae, with the Hydrobatidae splitting {{from the rest of the}} order at a later date. A few fossil species have been found, with the earliest being from the Upper Miocene.|$|E
5|$|Sontheimer {{suggests}} that the cult of Khandoba is at least older than 12th century, which can be determined by references in Jain and Lingayat texts and inscriptions. A 12th-century Jain author Brahmashiva claims that a Jain, who died in battle after a display of his valour, was later named as Mailara. By the 13th century, wide worship of Malhari or Mailara is observed by kings, Brahmins, simple folk and warriors. With the rise of Muslim empire, classical Hindu temples fell into ruin, giving rise to the folk religion such as of Khandoba. Chakradhara remarks, 'by {{the end of the}} Kali Yuga, temples of Vishnu and Shiva will be destroyed, but those of Mailara will stay'. A 1369 AD inscription at Ailoni near Warangal tells an account of Mallari different from Malhari Mahatmya— Shiva helped the epic hero Arjuna kill the demon Malla, thus acquiring the title of Mallari. Mailara <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> deity of Kakatiya dynasty (1083–1323 AD); a text from their rule records the self-torture rituals of Mailara-devotees and describes the deity. Throughout his development, Mailara is looked upon as a lower manifestation of Ishvara (God) by Lingayat and Maharashtrian bhakti saints.|$|E
