5|$|A Falls Count Anywhere {{match between}} Kurt Angle and Abyss followed, lasting 17 minutes. At {{one point during}} the {{encounter}} while Abyss <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> the concrete floor and Angle was on the stage, Angle performed a running leap off the stage into a somersault senton, connecting with Abyss on the floor. Angle was the victor in the bout, after throwing Abyss off of a scaffold through the Spanish announcers' table, then descending and covering Abyss for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|Next {{came the}} match between Irwin R. Schyster and Razor Ramon for the Intercontinental Championship, for which Jim Ross and Gorilla Monsoon {{took over the}} {{commentary}} roles. The match began with a brawl between the two, and Ramon got the early advantage. Schyster eventually threw Ramon over the top rope and attacked him on the floor. I.R.S. kept control of the match for quite a while, applying a reverse chinlock while using the ring ropes for additional leverage. After Ramon escaped the hold, {{he was able to}} perform a fallaway slam on Schyster. He then used an Irish Whip to throw Schyster into the corner, but the match turned around with a ref bump when referee Joey Marella was in the way and was kayfabe knocked unconscious. Shawn Michaels ran to the ring with his fake Intercontinental belt and hit Ramon with it, and Schyster helped revive Marella to count the pinfall. I.R.S. appeared to win the title, but referee Earl Hebner came to the ring and explained the situation to Marella. When Michaels' belt was discovered in the ring, the match was restarted. Ramon simply grabbed Schyster, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> the second turnbuckle celebrating, and performed the Razor's Edge for the victory.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Mr. Perfect and Brutus Beefcake {{began at}} the 1990 Royal Rumble. Beefcake, whose gimmick {{included}} cutting his opponents' hair, was wrestling The Genius, Perfect's manager. When he began giving The Genius a haircut when Perfect interfered and caused a double disqualification. Perfect and Beefcake wrestled each other at WrestleMania VI, and Beefcake won the match. Perfect won the Intercontinental Championship on April 23, 1990 in a tournament final. He had caused Beefcake to be eliminated from the tournament by interfering in his match. Beefcake and Perfect {{had a series of}} matches at house shows leading up to their planned SummerSlam match. Shortly before SummerSlam, Beefcake was injured while he <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> a beach and a female friend's knees hit him in the face while she was parasailing. Several bones in his face were legitimately broken, including his jaw and nose. As a result, the Texas Tornado replaced Beefcake in the SummerSlam match.|$|E

25|$|Ten {{days before}} the attack on Georgi Markov, Bulgarian defector, Vladimir Kostov survived an attack {{similar to the one}} against Markov. Kostov <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> an {{escalator}} of the Paris metro when he felt a sting in his lower back above the belt of his trousers. He developed a fever, but recovered. After Markov's death the wound on Kostov's back was examined and a ricin-laced pellet identical to the one used against Markov was removed.|$|E

25|$|On May 9, 2015, the Pirates {{became the}} first MLB team to turn a 4–5–4 triple play. The triple play {{occurred}} during a 7–5 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. The play occurred when the Cardinals' Yadier Molina lined out to Pittsburgh second baseman Neil Walker. Walker then threw to third baseman Jung Ho Kang to double off the Cardinals' Jhonny Peralta for the second out. Kang then threw the ball back to Walker, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> second base for the final out after St. Louis’ Jason Heyward froze between second and third.|$|E
25|$|European windstorms {{bringing}} {{heavy rain}} and gale-force winds caused damage and flooding {{to the south}} of Great Britain on 13–14 November. Unsettled weather continued across the south and later to the north. On 19–20 November, many towns and villages in Cumbria and Dumfries and Galloway were affected. A number of bridges collapsed, one of which led to the death of a police officer, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> the bridge when it collapsed. Another death occurred on 21 November as a canoeist was trapped against a tree near Poundsgate, on Dartmoor in Devon. In Powys, there were two deaths, at Newtown and Talybont-on-Usk.|$|E
25|$|On February 14th, Roger Craig, a Dallas deputy sheriff, {{testified that}} during the {{assassination}} he <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> {{the far side of}} Dealey Plaza across from the Texas School Book Depository. Craig said that immediately afterwards he ran to where the shooting occurred and saw a man that he later identified as Oswald run down the slope away from the building and get into a green station wagon driven by a man with dark complexion. That same day, Carolyn Walther, a Dallas resident, testified that she observed within an open window of the School Book Depository a man in a white shirt holding a gun accompanied by another man wearing a brown suit coat.|$|E

25|$|When the two {{submarines}} arrived {{they were}} off Mendoza Island (now Shenggao Island) {{at the entrance of}} the bay. The two then split up, L4 went to patrol around the entrance of the bay and Halahan ordered L5 to patrol within. Bias Bay is surrounded by rocks and that night there was a fleet of fishing junks sheltering inside and constantly moving around the anchorage. Both the rocks and the junks made it difficult for the British to monitor the area without being detected though they succeeded in doing so and on the morning of 20 October they encountered the Irene steaming off Cake Island. She had been taken over by at least eighteen pirates armed with automatic pistols. It was still dark so the L4 was surface cruising with a crew at the 4-inch (102-mm) gun and another pair at the vessel's searchlight. Lieutenant Halahan knew that torpedoes were not helpful in recapturing a pirate held ship but he did have a 4-inch (102-mm) deck gun. Then the Irene was spotted so Halahan maneuvered his submarine into position for firing and when the order was given, the search light was turned on and the gun crew fired a blank warning shot at the steamer. When the shot was ignored a second live round was fired and it blew a hole straight through the ship and killed a pirate who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> deck.|$|E

500|$|Doby {{entered the}} game in the seventh inning as a pinch-hitter for relief pitcher Bryan Stephens and {{recorded}} a strikeout. In the 1949 movie The Kid from Cleveland, Veeck tells the story that Gordon struck out on three swings in his immediate at-bat after Doby to save face for his new teammate. However, Doby's second strike {{was the result of a}} foul ball, both the Associated Press and Chicago Tribune stated Doby struck out on five pitches instead of three, and in addition, Gordon <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> third base during Doby's at-bat.

500|$|He next {{shot at the}} {{instructor}}, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> {{the east}} side of the stage. The instructor tried to run out the exit at the southeast corner, but that door was locked. The instructor then ran out through the main exit at the east end of the classroom, through which the students were trying to leave. Some students who were not able to immediately escape hid under or in between the seats. When Kazmierczak paused to reload after firing three rounds, some students shouted [...] "He's reloading" [...] and began to escape. Others continued to hide or were too shocked to react.|$|E
500|$|The {{third period}} was {{relatively}} even. [...] Montreal outshot Calgary 10–7 for the period, and 39–37 for the game. Roman Hamrlik sent the Flames to their fourth power play at 8:58 of the period, and the Flames capitalized {{a minute later}} when Jarome Iginla sent a pass over a sprawling Montreal defender to Tanguay, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> top of the crease and tapped the puck into the net. Kiprusoff held Montreal off the scoreboard {{for the remainder of}} the game to record his fourth shutout of the season, and the first in the NHL's outdoor history. With the win, the Flames became only the second home team to win an NHL outdoor game, following the Boston Bruins, who won the 2010 Winter Classic at Fenway Park.|$|E

When he was sixteen years old, Kirkland spent six weeks in Kenya with a film crew that was making a documentary film called A Visit to a Chief's Son.

[...] "It would be like in the United States, saying: 'I walked out of Grand Central Station and then I turned left and <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> the south rim of the Grand Canyon.'

500|$|Hamence had {{one last}} chance {{to make his case}} for Test {{selection}} in the match against Sussex at Hove, the last county fixture before the First Test at Trent Bridge. He came to the crease at 4/453 and made 34 in a stand of 96 with Harvey. His dismissal and Harvey reaching his 100 prompted Australia to declare at 5/549. Bradman said that Hamence was [...] "the unlucky player of the match" [...] and that he <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> the balcony ready to declare when Hamence fell on the last ball of the over. Australia went on to complete an innings victory. In the second innings, Hamence opened the bowling with Ray Lindwall. He took an early wicket before ending the innings by claiming the last man to fall, a stumping by Ron Saggers standing up to the stumps.|$|E
500|$|Armstrong {{was not a}} [...] "walker"; he {{believed}} in waiting for the umpire to make a decision, once telling the English cricketer Arthur Gilligan, [...] "The more you play this game, the more you will find out that will be given out many times when you are not out and vice versa". [...] English professional cricketers took {{a dim view of}} Armstrong's approach to the game. [...] Jack Hobbs, describing one instance said, The chief offender was Warwick Armstrong, who got very nasty and unsportsmanlike, refusing to accept the umpire's decision. That upset me. I did not know if <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> my head or my heels with the consequence that two balls later I let one go, never even attempting to play it; and it bowled me. I still bear this incident in mind against Armstrong.|$|E
