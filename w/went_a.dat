5|$|Arsenal set a Champions League record {{during the}} 2005–06 season by going ten matches without conceding a goal, beating the {{previous}} best of seven set by A.C. Milan. They <b>went</b> <b>a</b> record total stretch of 995minutes without letting an opponent score; the streak {{ended in the}} final, when Samuel Eto'o scored a 76th-minute equaliser for Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Hope led Albion to {{a victory}} {{at the start of}} their League Cup campaign, having {{received}} a bye past the first round, scoring a hat-trick as the team went on to defeat Aston Villa 6–0. Albion played Manchester City on 5 October 1966 in the third round, and although they won the game 4–2, they were pressed hard for the victory. Albion <b>went</b> <b>a</b> goal down after nine minutes against Northampton Town, but came back to win 3–1.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their strong}} first half {{up to that}} point, Bolton <b>went</b> <b>a</b> goal behind in the 37th minute. Liverpool midfielder Steve McManaman {{received}} the ball from John Barnes, he ran past Bolton defender Alan Stubbs, then past Scott Green. His subsequent shot was not powerful, but Bolton goalkeeper Keith Branagan could not stop the ball from going into the goal, giving Liverpool a 1–0 lead.|$|E

5|$|McNamara {{played in}} all eight games and started four as the U.S. <b>went</b> <b>a</b> perfect 8-0. In those games, he {{averaged}} 8.4 points, 1.9 rebounds and a squad-best 2.6 assists per game. McNamara finished off the tournament with 13 points and five rebounds {{to help the}} Americans win the gold-medal game over previously unbeaten Ukraine, 85-70.|$|E
5|$|Seasons {{may play}} a role in some regions. A {{dramatic}} change in colour and texture is created by seasonal snowy conditions in northern latitudes, necessitating repainting of vehicles and separate snow oversuits. The Eastern and northern European countries have a tradition for separate winter uniforms rather than oversuits. During the Second World War, the Waffen-SS <b>went</b> <b>a</b> step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, as well as white winter oversuits.|$|E
5|$|After their {{win over}} Manchester City, the team then <b>went</b> <b>a</b> club-record 19 games without a victory, {{eventually}} finishing the 1999–2000 season 17th, with two late wins helping stave off relegation. The 2000–01 season saw them again narrowly avoid relegation, finishing 19th overall. The 2001–02 season {{turned out to}} be the club's worst ever season at the time. With Stockport already bottom of the league, a 4–0 home defeat to Millwall saw manager Kilner sacked. Former England international Carlton Palmer was appointed in November 2001. Palmer subsequently failed to stop Stockport being relegated in 2001–02 or to build a team capable of challenging for a return the next season.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} season in good form and equalled Nottingham Forest's unbeaten league run of 42 matches against Middlesbrough. The team set a new English {{division}} record and <b>went</b> <b>a</b> further seven games unbeaten before losing to Manchester United in controversial circumstances. Arsenal's form suffered as a result and defensive shortcomings became more apparent; two draws and a defeat in November reinforced Chelsea's position {{at the top of}} the table, where they remained for the rest of the season. At home to Crystal Palace in February 2005, Wenger named an Arsenal squad with no English players – a first in the club's history which attracted criticism from the media. The team ended the season strongly, with a run of eight wins from nine games ensuring a second-place finish. 32 different players represented the club in five competitions and there were 15 different goalscorers. Arsenal's top goalscorer was Thierry Henry, who scored 30 goals in 42 games.|$|E
5|$|Because works {{critical}} of {{the leadership of the}} Chinese regime are considered sensitive, Gui always kept his work projects secret; he kept his movements to himself and his telephone calls were re-routed through foreign countries. He <b>went</b> <b>a</b> long period without entering China; he did not visit his father when the latter was ill, and did not return to China for his father's funeral. Media sources reported that Gui had published about half of the popular books written on Bo Xilai. When Bo was caught in the political fallout from the Wang Lijun incident in 2013, Gui reaped a financial benefit of HK$10million from the surge in book sales. Gui's publishing financed his property acquisitions in Hong Kong and Germany, including a seaside retreat in Pattaya, Thailand.|$|E
5|$|Being {{from the}} First and Second Divisions respectively, both Arsenal and Sheffield United were seeded {{into the third}} round of the FA Cup. In the third round itself, Arsenal was drawn away against Third Division South team Bristol Rovers. Arsenal missed a penalty, and the third Division team <b>went</b> <b>a</b> goal up in the first half; Arsenal were playing so poorly that it seemed they would {{struggle}} even for a draw. The turnaround in the match occurred when Cliff Bastin took over from Bobby Davidson at the inside left position. Arsenal equalized in the 65th minute, and scored further four times {{over the course of the}} following fourteen minutes to win the game by five goals to one, with a single goal from Bowden and two each from Drake and Bastin.|$|E

50|$|The Real Wheels {{series is}} a {{collection}} of children's videos (also known as There <b>Goes</b> <b>a...).</b> Three episodes, There <b>Goes</b> <b>a</b> Garbage Truck, There Goes the Mail and There <b>Goes</b> <b>a</b> Rescue Vehicle, were released {{as a part of the}} short-lived Dream Big series. Each episode focuses on different transportation vehicles; however, one episode is reserved for Santa Claus, and another for roller coasters. Each is live-action, starring Hood, and is sometimes accompanied by a sidekick, Becky Borg. He is absent from There <b>Goes</b> <b>a</b> Tractor, Farm Truck, and Dump Truck and is replaced by Dave Sidoni, but comes back in Here Comes a Roller Coaster and stars in 3 more episodes which are on Tanks, Rescue Heroes, and Buses.|$|R

5|$|Black {{remained}} in the starting rotation {{at the beginning of}} the 1944 Philadelphia Athletics season, despite possibility of him being drafted into the United States Army for World War II. He was rejected for military service after a physical examination on June 22, and remained with the team throughout the season. His win total improved from last season; however, he <b>went</b> <b>a</b> span of about a month, from June 28 until late July, without a victory. He finished the season with a 1012 record, a 4.06 ERA, and 27 games started, second highest on the team behind Bobo Newsom. At the end of the season, there were rumors that manager Connie Mack was planning to trade Black and Frankie Hayes to Cleveland for Jim Bagby, Jr. and Jeff Heath, though Mack stated that there was no substance to the rumors.|$|E
5|$|During Middleton's {{tenure at}} LSU the {{presidency}} of the university changed hands from President Atkinson to President James Monroe Smith, the latter an appointee of Governor Long. Towards the end of Middleton's fourth year on campus President Smith asked him if he would stay on for an additional year and also become Dean of Men. Middlteon responded that he would accept, but it had to be cleared through the War Department. Smith's request to the War Department for both the extension and the deanship for Middleton were approved. Toward the end of the fifth year Smith <b>went</b> <b>a</b> step further, suggesting that Middleton retire from the army and become a permanent member of the LSU staff. Middleton would not even consider retirement, but accepted a sixth year with the ROTC program. As he began his sixth year on campus, on 1 Aug 1935, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.|$|E
5|$|German close {{air support}} also began to take its toll, forcing units such as the Soviet 38th Army onto the defensive. It ranged over the front, {{operating}} dangerously close to the changing frontline. Air interdiction and direct ground support damaged Soviet supply lines and rear areas, also inflicting large losses on their armoured formations. General Franz Halder remarked the air attacks <b>went</b> <b>a</b> long way to breaking the Soviet offensive. The Soviet air force could do very little to stop these air attacks. Not only did the Luftwaffe attack the enemy, it also carried out vital supply missions. Bombers dropped supplies to encircled German units, which could continue to hold out until a counter-offensive relieved them. Over {{the course of the}} 16-day battle the German 6th Air Corps {{played a major role in}} the German victory, conducting 15,648 sorties (978 per day), dropping 7,700 tons of bombs on the Soviet forces and lifting 1,545 tons of material to the front.|$|E

5|$|Greinke {{made his}} Brewers {{debut in the}} second game of a doubleheader on May 4, 2011. Despite missing the first month of the season because of his injury, Greinke {{finished}} second on the team in wins with a 16–6 record. He also had a 3.83 ERA, and 201 strikeouts (7th in the National League (NL)) in 171 innings pitched while surrendering 45 walks. Greinke became only the fifth Brewer pitcher to strike out 200+ batters in a season. He was fourth in the NL in won-lost percentage (.727) and sixth in wins. He <b>went</b> <b>a</b> perfect 11–0 in his starts at Miller Park, the Brewers' home stadium.|$|E
5|$|I {{think that}} the band went on... maybe not a tangent, {{but we had a}} goal in mind, {{and at the end of}} the {{recording}} process, we were so proud of how artistic we were.

5|$|In 2001, Zito Switched his Uniform Number to 75 (which {{he would}} wear {{throughout}} the rest of his career) finished third in the American League (AL) in strikeouts per nine innings (8.61), fourth in strikeouts (205), sixth in wins (17), eighth in ERA (3.49), and tenth in winning percentage (.680). Zito became the sixth lefty aged 23 or younger since 1902 to strike out at least 200 batters in a season. After a great rookie season, Zito struggled through {{the early part of the}} 2001 season, posting a 6–7 record with a 5.01 ERA in his first 22 starts. However, he rebounded nicely and by August, he was putting up good pitching numbers. Zito was named Pitcher of the Month in August, going 5–1 with a 1.02 ERA. Zito won Pitcher of the Month again in September, going 6–0 with a 1.89 ERA. During those last two months of the season, Zito <b>went</b> <b>a</b> combined 11–1 with a 1.32 ERA, best in baseball.|$|E

5|$|In December 2003, Kesler was {{released}} by the Vancouver Canucks {{to play in the}} 2004 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, Kesler's second World Junior tournament. Kesler scored two goals as the Americans <b>went</b> <b>a</b> perfect 4–0 to win Pool A and advance to the semifinals. There they defeated Finland 2–1, the team that had defeated them in the previous year's bronze medal game, to advance to the gold medal game versus Canada. In the gold medal game, Kesler scored the game-tying goal 6:58 into the third period to even the score at 3–3. After Canadian goaltender Marc-André Fleury cleared the puck off of teammate Braydon Coburn and into his own net, the Americans took the lead 4–3 and went on to win their first IIHF World U20 Championship in the tournament's history. Kesler's play in the tournament was praised as he often took critical faceoffs and played on the Americans' most offensive line despite suffering a facial injury early in the tournament.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011 a new {{reform of}} the Stability and Growth Pact was initiated, aiming at {{straightening}} the rules by adopting an automatic procedure for imposing of penalties in case of breaches of either the 3% deficit or the 60% debt rules. By {{the end of the}} year, Germany, France and some other smaller EU countries <b>went</b> <b>a</b> step further and vowed to create a fiscal union across the eurozone with strict and enforceable fiscal rules and automatic penalties embedded in the EU treaties. On 9 December 2011 at the European Council meeting, all 17 members of the eurozone and six countries that aspire to join agreed on a new intergovernmental treaty to put strict caps on government spending and borrowing, with penalties for those countries who violate the limits. All other non-eurozone countries apart from the UK are also prepared to join in, subject to parliamentary vote. The treaty will enter into force on 1 January 2013, if by that time 12 members of the euro area have ratified it.|$|E
5|$|In November 1793, Shelby {{received}} a letter from another of Genêt's agents, Charles Delpeau. He confided to Shelby that he had been sent to secure supplies for an expedition against Spanish holdings, and inquired whether Shelby had been instructed to arrest individuals associated with such a scheme. Three days later Shelby responded by letter, relating Jefferson's warning against aiding the French. Despite having no evidence that Shelby was party to Genêt's scheme, both Jefferson and Knox felt compelled to warn him a second time. Jefferson provided names and descriptions of the French agents believed to be in Kentucky and encouraged their arrest. Knox <b>went</b> <b>a</b> step further by suggesting Kentucky would be reimbursed for any costs incurred resisting the French by force, should such action become necessary. General Anthony Wayne informed him that his cavalry was at the state's disposal. Arthur St. Clair, governor of the American Northwest Territory, also admonished Shelby against cooperation with Genêt.|$|E
