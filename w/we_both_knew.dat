500|$|To {{achieve a}} tone and quality {{that was true}} to the story as well as {{reflected}} {{the period in which}} it is set, Spielberg once again collaborated with cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, saying, [...] "Early on, <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> that we did not want this to look like a Technicolor extravaganza about World War II, but more like color newsreel footage from the 1940s, which is very desaturated and low-tech." [...] Kamiński had the protective coating stripped from the camera lenses, making them closer to those used in the 1940s. He explains that [...] "without the protective coating, the light goes in and starts bouncing around, which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus." [...] The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through bleach bypass, a process that reduces brightness and color saturation. The shutter timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences, as opposed to the standard of 180-degree timing. Kamiński clarifies, [...] "In this way, we attained a certain staccato in the actors' movements and a certain crispness in the explosions, which makes them slightly more realistic." ...|$|E

"I am {{perfectly}} certain," [...] Arnold declared, vigorously, [...] "that {{if there}} has been anything irregular in her uncle's life, Miss Lalonde knew nothing of it. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> that he talked wildly, but, for the rest, his doings have been as much a mystery to her as to me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I wish {{to speak}} to you," [...] she began abruptly, [...] "about that young man <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> of. Have you seen {{anything}} of him lately?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{about your}} debts? Of course I couldn't pay debts which were always increasing. And of course your {{promises}} {{for the future}} were false. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> that they were false when they were made. Did we not?" [...] She paused for an answer, but he made none. [...] "They meant nothing; did they? He is dead now." ...|$|E
60|$|And over {{we went to}} the shipyard, where Charley led the way to the Mary Rebecca, lying {{hauled out}} on the ways, where she was being cleaned and overhauled. She was a scow-schooner <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> well, {{carrying}} a cargo of one hundred and forty tons and a spread of canvas greater than other schooner on the bay.|$|E
60|$|The Boy was black-haired, {{and so was}} the Major, luckily. I cut off a {{piece of}} the Major's hair above the temple with a knife, and put it into the packet we were making. The laughing-fit and the chokes got hold of me again, and I had to stop. The Major was nearly as bad; and <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> that the worst part of the work was to come.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't deceive {{us for a}} minute!" [...] she cried. [...] "Not for a second. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that you've been enjoying {{yourself}} immensely. Hasn't he, Katharine?" ...|$|R

60|$|She {{seemed to}} draw herself {{together}} inside her dress. Her eyes glittered. My mouth felt very dry, {{and my heart}} was beginning to thump. We were both furiously angry. It was a moment that had been coming for years, and <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> it. For my part I was glad that it had come. On subjects on which one feels deeply it is a relief to speak one's mind.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because, Madam, that night,' he continued, {{twitching}} {{her by the}} sleeve, 'it {{happens that}} <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> secrets which we didn't choose to tell, and both knew just the same professionally. And so the less you say about such things the better, Mrs. Snitchey; and take this {{as a warning to}} have wiser and more charitable eyes another time. Miss Marion, I brought a friend of yours along with me. Here! Mistress!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so proud," [...] she was saying, [...] "that at last, {{after you}} have done so much for me, I can do a little thing for you. For it is {{something}} to free you, Tommy. You have always pretended, for my sake, {{that we could not}} do without each other, but <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> all the time that it was only I who was unable to do without you. You can't deny it." ...|$|E
5000|$|The EP's {{title is}} derived from {{a line in the}} song [...] "This Is 2005" [...] ("Oh you're so deep, your taste is chic/But <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that talk is cheap").|$|R

60|$|Well {{might he}} be anxious, for as <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew,</b> {{no one in}} the {{neighbourhood}} had guns except ourselves, and all ours were accounted for. It is true that we had promised to give the majority of those we had taken from the slavers to Bausi when we went away, and that I had been instructing some of his best soldiers in the use of them, but not one of these had as yet been left in their possession.|$|E
60|$|But {{there were}} {{reasons why we}} {{could not find a}} lock fit to send. The Boy was black-haired, and so was the Major, luckily. I cut off a piece of the Major's hair above the temple with a knife, and put it into the packet we were making. The laughing-fit and the chokes got hold of me again, and I had to stop. The Major was nearly as bad; and <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> that the worst part of the work was to come.|$|E
6000|$|... "Alex Radrivsky. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> him. He {{disappeared}} {{about six}} o'clock. The sun {{had just come}} up. About noon Klaus and I had an hour relief. We crept off, away from the bunkers. No one was watching. We came here. There {{used to be a}} town here, a few houses, a street. This cellar was part of a big farmhouse. We knew Tasso would be here, hiding down in her little place. We had come here before. Others from the bunkers came here. Today happened to be our turn." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lawford's cheek turned more sallow than ever. 'You {{are only}} pretending {{to look for}} it,' he said, 'to try me. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> {{perfectly}} well the lock is broken. Ada broke it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, if you command it, Doctor, needs must;--but I {{can tell}} you there is a man <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know,</b> that has a {{thousand}} reasons at least for keeping him in the public ward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is.... Miss Joline, I {{feel like}} doing {{something}} I've wanted to do for some time. Of course <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> you {{think of me as}} 'that poor little dub, Mrs. What's-her-name, D. T.'s secretary--'" ...|$|R
60|$|Your {{dear friend}} amused me and amused himself {{as long as}} it suited his inclinations; and then {{reminded}} me that we were both people of the world, that we both understood mankind, that <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> {{there was no such thing}} as romance, that we were both prepared for going different ways to seek our fortunes like people of sense, and that we both foresaw that whenever we encountered one another again we should meet as the best friends on earth. So he said, and I did not contradict him.|$|E
60|$|He {{called for}} another absinthe. Stroeve, with voluble tongue, {{explained}} {{how he and}} I had met, and by what an accident we discovered that <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> Strickland. I {{do not know if}} Strickland listened. He glanced at me once or twice reflectively, {{but for the most part}} seemed occupied with his own thoughts; and certainly without Stroeve's babble the conversation would have been difficult. In half an hour the Dutchman, looking at his watch, announced that he must go. He asked whether I would come too. I thought, alone, I might get something out of Strickland, and so answered that I would stay.|$|E
60|$|Another night {{consultation}} with Herbert after Provis was gone home (I always took him home, and always looked well about me), {{led us to}} the conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came back from Miss Havisham's. In the mean time, Herbert and I were to consider separately what {{it would be best to}} say; whether we should devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious observation; or whether I, who had never yet been abroad, should propose an expedition. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> that I had but to propose anything, and he would consent. We agreed that his remaining many days in his present hazard was not to be thought of.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I say not," [...] growled Jenssen. [...] "I've always let you boss things, Sven; but here's a {{case where}} what I say has got to go--because I'm right and you're wrong, and <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, sir. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> {{too well}} what becometh us; {{but when you}} were casting about for a mate for my young mistress, I could not but think how men seek far, and {{overlook}} the jewel at their feet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is {{the very}} remark by which I put my foot in it, but my Lady was horrified, and the {{consequence}} was, that it fell to me to advise Felix to resign the class. I never hated {{a piece of work}} so much in my life, for he had worked the lads well, and <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> that there would be an end of them. Moreover, Felix has some of the true Briton about him, and he stood out--would give up the class if the Rector ordered him, but would relinquish Sunday-school altogether in that case; and the two girls were furious; but, after one Sunday, he came to me, said that he found hostility poisoned his teaching, gave up, and accepted the younger ones.' ...|$|E
60|$|We {{all felt}} a little anxiety to hear O'Brien's account of the matter, and after having {{deposited}} the ladies at their homes, Mackinnon and I went off to his lodgings. At first he was denied to us, but after awhile we got his servant to acknowledge {{that he was at}} home, and then we made our way up to his studio. We found him seated behind a half-formed model, or rather a mere lump of clay punched into something resembling the shape of a head, with a pipe in his mouth and a bit of stick in his hand. He was pretending to work, though <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> that it {{was out of the question}} that he should do anything in his present frame of mind.|$|E
6000|$|And indeed, this {{unanimity}} {{was sufficiently}} startling. For {{nothing could have}} been more different than the dress in the two cases. In the murder scene, the man seemed to wear a tweed suit and knickerbockers,--he was indistinct, as I said before, against the blurred light of the window: while in the athletic scene, he wore just a thin jersey and running-drawers, cut short at the knee, with his arms and legs bare, and his muscles contracted. Yet for all that, <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> him for the same man at once. That stooping back was unmistakable; that position of the hand was characteristic and unique. We were sure he was the same man. I trembled with agitation. I had a clue to the murderer! ...|$|E
6000|$|She grew serious again. [...] "No, I don't. Anybody can see you're honest. I {{trust you}} more than I do Judge Crego, {{and so does the}} Captain. You can tell us things we want to <b>know.</b> <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> a little about business, but we don't know much about other things. That's where <b>we</b> <b>both</b> fall down." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the film, Tyrone tells Denny Harley who bullies Miles {{that the}} reason they both tic is:Tyrone: ... because <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> the code.Denny: ...

6000|$|... "No, Constance. But my {{discourse}} will {{be about}} my life at the East End of London, and what I have seen there. I shall talk not of ancient things but of the present--that sad present <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know.</b> You can realise it all so vividly--it will be painful to you." ...|$|R
