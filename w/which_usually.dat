5|$|Climate-related natural {{disasters}} cause massive losses of Indian life and property.

Other dangers include frequent summer dust storms, <b>which</b> <b>usually</b> track from north to south; they cause extensive property damage in North India and deposit large amounts of dust from arid regions. Hail is also common in parts of India, causing severe damage to standing crops such as rice and wheat.|$|E
5|$|Current {{limitations}} to p-doping limit electronic and optoelectronic applications of ZnO, <b>which</b> <b>usually</b> require junctions of n-type and p-type material. Known p-type dopants include group-I elements Li, Na, K; group-V elements N, P and As; {{as well as}} copper and silver. However, many of these form deep acceptors and do not produce significant p-type conduction at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{nationwide}} attention the incident received, the Mussel Slough Tragedy is not remembered much today {{as well as}} later gunfights such as the gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

Burrowing rodents may eat the fruiting bodies of fungi and spread spores through their feces, thereby allowing the fungi to disperse and form symbiotic relationships with the roots of plants (<b>which</b> <b>usually</b> cannot thrive without them). As such, these rodents {{may play a role}} in maintaining healthy forests.|$|E

5|$|Nearly 40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinoma, <b>which</b> <b>usually</b> {{originates}} in peripheral lung tissue. Although most cases of adenocarcinoma {{are associated with}} smoking, adenocarcinoma {{is also the most}} common form of lung cancer among people who have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes ("never-smokers") and ex-smokers with a modest smoking history. A subtype of adenocarcinoma, the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, is more common in female never-smokers, and may have a better long-term survival.|$|E
