40|$|In appraising {{applicable}} legislation and regulation to {{various types of}} flights using various types of aircraft in Curaçao, it will become clear {{that it will not}} be easy to apply this regime <b>without</b> much <b>further</b> <b>ado</b> to sub-orbital flights. While perhaps on individual aspects certain definitions used may prima facie relatively easily apply or be made to apply, the extended details of almost all of those regimes at some point or other would likely go astray of what would make sense with respect to sub-orbital flights. It is not accidental therefore, that the FAA has chosen to start from the other end, not trying to apply existing regulation for aircraft and aviation and then tweak it across the board to fit the specifics of sub-orbital flight, but rather start ‘from scratch’, and develop a sui generis regime which actually fits this novel activity. In the course of doing so, its huge experience with licensing and certification in the aviation sector will then certainly come in handy, but the principled approach is to work with the industry as long as neither have a real clue as to what might consistently go wrong. Of course, in addition to a Congressional mandate to protect by way of regulation the public interests in private manned spaceflight (safety, security, protection of the environment and suchlike), the FAA also has a mandate to support an infant industry – a second mandate European aviation regulatory authorities usually do not have. And while this may apply by proxy to Curaçao as well, {{as a part of the}} Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Curaçao authorities indeed seem to be aware that it is also in the public interest to see such an infant industry take off on their island – and that they should at least avoid to blindly try to fit the square peg of aviation regulation into the round hole of sub-orbital spaceflight – or was it the other way around...|$|R
5000|$|It {{were not}} only the Blueberry creators that were left in a pickle, as Koralle had managed to {{convince}} other well known Franco-Belgian comic artists to switch sides. Aside from Giraud's old mentor Jijé (who, having abandoned his own Jerry Spring Western comic, was now penciling Charlier's revitalized Redbeard and Tanguy et Laverdure), these predominantly concerned artists from publishing house Le Lombard. The most prominent of the latter was Hermann Huppen with his new post-apocalyptic Western Jeremiah {{for which he had}} abandoned that other famed 1970s Franco-Belgian Western, Comanche (written by Greg), second only in renown after Blueberry at the time. Tapping into his substantial social Franco-Belgian comic network, Charlier found Jacques de Kezel [...] - [...] a highly influential behind-the-scenes figure of the Belgian comic world at those times, and who had actually gathered the stable of artists for Koralle [...] - [...] willing for Axel Springer to pass the torch to. As a token of goodwill, a relieved Springer, as they now could turn over the current contractual obligations <b>without</b> much <b>further</b> <b>ado,</b> even allowed the French-language version of Zack, Super As, to run for a few issues longer in order to allow as many series as possible to complete their magazine run, which included [...] "La longue marche". De Kezel's new publishing house Les Nouvelles Editions Internationales S.A. (Novedi) was established in November 1980 with its seat in Brussels, Belgium. Part of their strategy was to forego on a magazine of their own and instead release titles directly in album format, as it was noticed that the serialized comic magazine format had already started to wane in Europe as a format, resulting in the advantage of not having to incur the expenses of maintaining magazine editorial offices. Any still existing comic magazine elsewhere, willing to publish serialized comic series after the initial book releases, was merely considered an added bonus.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MA) [...] PU for CHE, 1983. There {{are various}} and widely {{divergent}} ideas on anaphorics. In this study {{the emphasis was}} in the first place on the shifts in stress which have occurred in the course of time in the approaches to General Linguistics and therefore also to anaphorics. A study of the relevant literature indicated that the view according to which language is studied as an abstraction is unacceptable, seeing that this only offers a reflection of idealised forms. Through the study of language-in-use language is studied as it exists in reality. In Afrikaans there is no analysis of anaphorics as it occurs in language-In-use. In this study the point of departure is that reference is situationally bound, therefore anaphorics is studied within a certain context. Anaphoric relations were analysed in the texts Houd-den-Bek by Andre P Brink and Die swerfjare van Poppie Nongena by Elsa Joubert, as well as in spoken sub-standard Afrikaans as it occurs in conversations held with Griquas, especially from Griqualand West and taped. The frequency of usage of the various types of anaphoria was determined in terms of percentages. In an anaphoric link an antecedent and an anaphor are distinguished which both refer to a matter outside themselves, viz. the referent. Reference is basically a semantic process which can be encoded by means of referential markers. Anaphoric chains are dependent on antecedents through which the referent might be identified and individualized. On the basis of this the viewpoint is held that pronouns cannot act as antecedents seeing that their informational content is too void to cause distinction. Seeing that all antecedents do not identify and individualize the referent equally effectively, it is suggested that a hier= archy of antecedents be established. With respect to reference there is a distinction between referential and co-referential. Anticipatory and retrocipatory anaphorics can be distinguished on the basis of whether the antecedent precedes the anaphor or succeeds it. Retrocipatory anaphorics forms {{a very small percentage of}} anaphoric references and point to the fact that new information is provided first. Pronominal anaphorics reveals the highest frequency of usage. Pronouns do not refer <b>without</b> any <b>further</b> <b>ado</b> to preceding nouns. Deixis and the context within which the utterance occurs are of cardinal importance in this respect. Master...|$|R

For a whole year, from October 1927 to October 1928, Bourguiba concatenated traineeship: First he was hired by a certain Mr. Cirier, who dismissed him after six weeks.

[...] As it turned out it was not Mesko but George Larsen of Cranford, N.J., who dashed from the stands to aid Dartmouth in her game with Princeton. Asa Bushnell III, Princeton class of 1947, wrote of the incident in 1960 for the Princeton Athletic News: [...] "Strange as it may seem, it was a young architect from Cranford, N.J., a refugee from the University of Cincinnati, no less - who immortalized the activities in Palmer Stadium on November 23, 1935.

2500|$|Erich Honecker {{had hoped}} that the Soviets would enter the GDR, as by the Warsaw Pact, and restore the {{communist}} government and suppress the civilian protests. By 1990 the Soviet Government deemed it impractical for the Soviet Union to continue holding its grasp on the Eastern Bloc, and so it took a neutral stance regarding the events happening in East Germany. Faced with this ongoing civil unrest, the SED deposed Honecker on 18 October and replaced him with the number-two-man in the regime, Egon Krenz. However, the demonstrations kept growing – on Monday 23 October the Leipzig protesters numbered 300,000 and remained as large the following week. The border to Czechoslovakia was opened again on 1 November, but the Czechoslovak authorities soon let all East Germans travel directly to West Germany <b>without</b> <b>further</b> bureaucratic <b>ado,</b> thus lifting their part of the Iron Curtain on 3 November. On 4 November the authorities decided to authorize a demonstration in Berlin and were faced with the Alexanderplatz demonstration where half a million citizens converged on the capital demanding freedom in the biggest protest the GDR ever witnessed. Unable to stem the ensuing flow of refugees to the West through Czechoslovakia, the East German authorities eventually caved in to public pressure by allowing East German citizens to enter West Berlin and West Germany directly, via existing border points, on 9 November 1989, without having properly briefed the border guards. Triggered by the erratic words of regime spokesman Günter Schabowski in a TV press conference, stating that the planned changes were in effect [...] "immediately, without delay," [...] {{hundreds of thousands of}} people took advantage of the opportunity. The guards were quickly overwhelmed by the growing crowds of people demanding to be let out into West Berlin. After receiving no feedback from their superiors, the guards, unwilling to use force, relented and opened the gates to West Berlin. Soon new crossing points were forced open in the Berlin Wall by the people, and sections of the wall were literally torn down as this symbol of oppression was overwhelmed. The bewildered guards were unaware of what was happening, and meekly stood by as the East Germans took to the wall with hammers and chisels.|$|R

5000|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, Giraud was dying to leave Pilote and Blueberry, partly because {{he was tired of}} the {{stifling}} publication pressure he was under in order to produce the series, partly because of the royalties conflict, but mostly because he wanted to further explore and develop his [...] "Mœbius" [...] alter ego. For Giraud the conflict was actually a godsend, [...] "At that moment Charlier and I also had a financial conflict with Dargaud which came at the exact right time, because it provided me with an alibi leave". The latter reason for him to leave, took on an urgency after Alejandro Jodorowsky, impressed by his Blueberry art, had already invited Giraud to come over to Los Angeles to work as concept designer and storyboard artist on his Dune movie project earlier that year, constituting the first Jodorowsky/Mœbius collaboration. Very eager to return to Los Angeles as Jodorowksy requested his presence again, Giraud [...] - [...] who had returned to France for his other work during one of the lulls in the Dune production [...] - [...] greatly accelerated his work on [...] "Angel Face", then underway, breaking his [...] "absolute record speed-drawing", as he had coined it, and sheared off weeks from its originally intended completion date. Giraud in overdrive was so fast that he even overtook Charlier's script pages (Charlier habitually fed his artists piecemeal with script pages, usually a couple at the time), forcing him to write ten pages of the story on his own, as Charlier was at that time on documentary assignment in the United States for French television. Upon his return, Charlier {{took one look at the}} pages completed in his absence, and continued where Giraud had left off <b>without</b> <b>further</b> much <b>ado.</b> Charlier himself had actually already left Dargaud in 1972, because he additionally felt ill at ease with the editorial modernization of Pilote, which resulted from the 1968 revolt at the editorial offices staged by key artists, chief among them Giraud (see also: [...] "Giraud on his part in the uprising at Pilote"). Though Charlier continued to provide his younger colleague with scripts (but not his other artists), he started working as documentary maker for French television. It was while he was working on two documentaries on the Mexican Revolution that he gained inspiration for his below-mentioned Les Gringos Western comic series, which started its run in 1979 at Koralle.|$|R
