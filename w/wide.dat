5|$|Although NFL rules {{generally}} require <b>wide</b> receivers to wear jersey {{numbers in}} the 10-19 and 80-89 range, players who later change positions are allowed to keep their previous number, {{as long as it}} is not within the 50-79 range for eligible receiver purposes. Hester was allowed to keep number 23, a number normally used for cornerbacks, since it sits outside the 50-79 range. Along with former Pittsburgh Steelers <b>wide</b> receiver Dwight Stone, who wore number 20 during his eight-year stint in Pittsburgh, Hester was one of two <b>wide</b> receivers to wear a 20's jersey number since the NFL adopted the current uniform numbering system in 1973.|$|E

By {{the end of its}} opening weekend of <b>wide</b> release, the film had grossed $3,545,305, securing the number five position at the domestic box office with an overall domestic gross of $14,726,112. The film generated strong local interest in the state of Mississippi, resulting in sold-out showings in the first four days of <b>wide</b> release. After seven weeks of <b>wide</b> release, Mississippi Burning ended its theatrical run with an overall gross of $34,603,943.
