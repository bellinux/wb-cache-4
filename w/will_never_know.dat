5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>know.</b> But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
25|$|In the cellars of Gestapo {{headquarters}} at Prinz-Albrecht-Straße, March is tortured {{but does not}} reveal the location of Maguire. Globocnik boasts that Auschwitz and the other camps have been totally razed, and March <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> the truth for certain. Kripo Chief Arthur Nebe stages a rescue, intending to track March as he meets with Maguire at their rendezvous in Waldshut-Tiengen on the Swiss/German border. March realises what is happening and heads for Auschwitz, leading the authorities in the wrong direction.|$|E

25|$|Vidal finds Ofelia {{talking to}} someone (the faun) whom Vidal cannot see. Vidal takes the baby from her arms and fatally shoots Ofelia; then, when he reaches the labyrinth's entrance, he is {{surrounded}} by the rebels who have taken over the outpost. Knowing {{that he will be}} killed, he hands the baby to Mercedes, demanding that she tell his son the exact time of his father's death. Mercedes replies that the child <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> so much as his name. Her brother Pedro kills Vidal.|$|E
25|$|It was a {{long held}} family secret, and its deeply buried shame {{was brought to the}} surface and unraveled. We <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> the destinies and {{legacies}} these men would have chosen for themselves if they had been allowed to make that choice. But I know this: their existence, however brief and cruelly interrupted, is forever woven into the fabric of my own life. My son will continue to be raised in an environment of tolerance, understanding and humility, now with even more pertinence than before.|$|E
25|$|Claire {{lives with}} Agnes and Tobias {{and appears to}} have no means of support except for them. Her main role in life {{seems to be to}} annoy and embarrass her sister. She is {{everything}} that Agnes dislikes. Claire makes the statement, after telling Tobias that he {{would be better off if}} he killed Agnes, Julia, and herself, that she <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> whether she wants to live until Agnes is dead. With this statement, Albee makes it sound as if Claire holds Agnes up as a role model, a model that she has never been able to reach. And instead of trying to reach it, she has done everything to live her life in a diametrically opposed manner.|$|E

25|$|A similar defense {{comes from}} Australian philosopher Frank Jackson (born 1943) who revived {{the theory of}} epiphenomenalism which argues that mental states do not {{play a role in}} {{physical}} states. Jackson argues that {{there are two kinds of}} dualism. The first is substance dualism that assumes there is second, non-corporeal form of reality. In this form, body and soul are two different substances. The second form is property dualism that says that body and soul are different properties of the same body. He claims that functions of the mind/soul are internal, very private experiences that are not accessible to observation by others, and therefore not accessible by science (at least not yet). We can know everything, for example, about a bat's facility for echolocation, but we <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> how the bat experiences that phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Lupin remains {{active in}} the Order {{throughout}} the year. He provides the casualty reports section on the pirate radio station Potterwatch under the pseudonym of Romulus. Lupin commands a group of defenders on the school grounds during the Battle of Hogwarts. Both Lupin and Tonks die in combat, killed by Antonin Dolohov and Bellatrix Lestrange respectively. At {{the time of his}} death, Lupin was the last surviving member of his group of friends. Rowling has since stated that she originally intended for both Lupin and Tonks to survive, but finally killed them off to compensate for the last-minute reprieve she gave to Arthur Weasley in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Lupin, along with Sirius, James, and Lily, makes one last appearance in the series when Harry uses the Resurrection Stone to bring them forth to comfort him. He expresses his regret that Teddy <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> his father, but says that he will know why he died: trying to make a world in which his son could live a better life.|$|E
25|$|Is {{there anybody}} {{anywhere}} today, I sometimes wonder, {{who had the}} opportunities which were mine, during three score and ten years of my adult life, to enjoy wonderful wines, the like of which the post-wars generations <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>know,</b> and the privilege to enjoy them with such wonderful friends? I doubt it. One of my oldest friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, a little man and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} a few friends who lunched with me at my old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate my return to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them and it really was magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E

500|$|Over 30,000 people {{attended}} Timoshenko's funeral in Flatlands, Brooklyn, where Mayor Michael Bloomberg delivered the eulogy, praising the fallen officer, stating, [...] "By stopping that car, he and Officer Yan helped us capture three career criminals whose appetite for evil knew no bounds—saving {{who knows how}} many future victims, people who <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> how lucky they are."

500|$|Eliot's Simeon appears {{similar to}} Dante's {{depiction}} of Virgil in the Divine Comedy, as [...] "the seer who can see only so far; the precursor who cannot {{enter the world}} that he makes possible". Virgil, in the Divine Comedy, leads Dante through Hell (Inferno) and Purgatory (Purgatorio), but cannot guide him into Paradise (Paradiso). In this context, Virgil was a symbol of non-Christian philosophy and humanities could not help Dante any further in his approach to God. [...] In Eliot's depiction, Simeon <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> the Christian culture he prophesizes, sensing [...] "the birth-pangs of a world that he will never occupy".|$|E
500|$|After a {{preliminary}} autopsy was performed, District of Columbia police announced {{that there was}} sufficient evidence to open a homicide investigation. On May 28, D.C. medical examiner Jonathan L. Arden officially declared Levy's death a homicide, but said, [...] "There's less to work with here than I would like. It's possible we <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> specifically how she died." [...] Arden found damage to her hyoid bone, suggesting possible strangulation, but did not deem it to be conclusive evidence of such a cause of death. On June 6, after the police completed their search, private investigators hired by the Levys found her shin bone with some twisted wire about [...] from the other remains. Police chief Ramsey said, [...] "It is unacceptable that these items were not located." ...|$|E

500|$|A cast of Swedish and American actors {{contributed to}} the recording. While Sparks {{recorded}} the music in the United States, Wennersten oversaw the recording of the Swedish voice artists in Stockholm. Translation of the lyrics was also handled in Sweden: [...] "Since I do not speak Swedish, I <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> how they managed," [...] Russell Mael said, expressing his appreciation for the efforts of everyone involved to translate the tone and spirit of the Maels' original text into Swedish lyrics. Sparks and Wennersten communicated mainly via an FTP server, with Sparks sending Wennersten their musical material, and Wennersten sending the edited Swedish voice recordings back to Sparks. Sparks were {{very pleased with the}} results of the collaboration, and the fact that Swedish actor Jonas Malmsjö, playing Bergman, had starred in several Bergman productions, enabling him to bring this personal experience to his portrayal of Bergman.|$|E
500|$|Dylan biographer Sid Griffin {{has noted}} that, because no written records were kept of these 1967 {{recording}} sessions, [...] "the world {{will have to}} live with the fact that it <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> exactly which Basement Tapes tune was recorded when and where". Nonetheless, using clues such as the sound quality of different batches of songs, and where they appear on the original reels of tapes, attempts have been made to place the songs into a rough chronology and guess the locations at which they were likely recorded. Biographer Clinton Heylin places [...] "Santa-Fe" [...] in the summer of 1967 at Big Pink. The liner notes of The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 date it in the fall of that year. Griffin lists it among the probable Big Pink recordings, and in a group of songs from around July, but concedes it is also [...] "unlikely [...] possible" [...] it came from the Red Room.|$|E
500|$|After {{publishing}} the book, Chang received hate mail, primarily from Japanese ultranationalists, and threatening notes on {{her car and}} also believed her phone was tapped. Her mother said the book [...] "made Iris sad". Suffering from depression, Chang was diagnosed with brief reactive psychosis in August 2004. She began taking medications to stabilize her mood. She wrote: I can never shake my belief that I was being recruited, and later persecuted, by forces more powerful than I could have imagined. Whether it was the CIA or some other organization I <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>know.</b> As long as I am alive, these forces will never stop hounding me. Chang committed suicide on November 9, 2004. A memorial service was held in China by Nanking Massacre survivors coinciding with her funeral in Los Altos, California. The Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre, a memorial site in Nanjing built to commemorate {{the victims of the}} Nanking Massacre, added a wing dedicated to her in 2005.|$|E
