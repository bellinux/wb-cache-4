This study examined these voluntary <b>warnings</b> in magazine ads and plotted their trends between 2012 and early 2015. ENDS magazine ads were obtained through Kantar media and <b>warnings</b> {{were collected from}} the Chicago Public Library or the Trinkets and Trash surveillance system. The prevalence of voluntary <b>warnings,</b> <b>warnings</b> with the specific capitalized word “WARNING”, and MarkTen <b>warnings</b> were examined after being weighted using factors related to exposure between January 2012 and March 2015. Five brands (MarkTen, NJOY, MISTIC, and some Blu) carried <b>warnings</b> during the study period. The prevalence of <b>warnings</b> post 2012 that contained a description of nicotine did not significantly increase until the launch of MarkTen, which also happened several months before April 2014 when the U.

40|$|Background: As of June 2009 most (89 %) European Union {{member states}} {{continue}} to use mandated text-only health <b>warnings</b> on tobacco products. This study assessed adolescent (aged 11 – 16 years) perceptions of and reactions to these text <b>warnings</b> on cigarette packs in the UK. Methods: Data comes from wave five of the cross-sectional Youth Tobacco Policy Survey in 2008. A total of 1401 adolescents were recruited and health <b>warnings</b> were assessed in terms of salience (noticing, reading), comprehension and credibility, memorability (recall), depth of processing (contemplating, discussing) and persuasiveness (put off smoking, make more likely to stop). Smokers were also asked about behavioural compliance (foregoing cigarettes due to <b>warnings,</b> avoidance of <b>warnings)</b> and perceptions of harm from their smoking (to indirectly assess possible knowledge gained from <b>warnings).</b> Results: Despite moderately high salience of <b>warnings,</b> memorability and, in particular, depth of processing was quite low, with <b>warnings</b> only sometimes thought about and very rarely discussed. <b>Warnings</b> were however considered comprehensible, credible and a reasonable deterrent for occasional and never smokers. Additionally, a third of regular smokers indicated that, in the last month, <b>warnings</b> had stopped them from having a cigarette. However, only 6 % of smokers indicated that <b>warnings</b> made them forego cigarettes frequently. Conclusion: Text <b>warnings</b> help to communicate the dangers associated with smoking and, resultantly, prompt {{a small number of}} smokers to forgo cigarettes and take action to avoid <b>warnings,</b> but depth of processing is low and <b>warnings</b> {{do not appear to be}} achieving their full potential among smokers...|$|R
