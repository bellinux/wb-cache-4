40|$|The {{results of}} {{laboratory}} measurements of large focusing <b>wave</b> <b>groups,</b> which were generated using the New Wave theory, are presented. The influences {{of both the}} steepness and frequency bandwidth on focused wave characteristics were examined. The influence of frequency bandwidth on focused <b>wave</b> <b>groups</b> with small and moderate steepness was very small. However, for cases with the large steepness, the nonlinearity increased with increasing bandwidth frequency and widened free-wave regimes are identified for those cases with large steepness at the focal location. The underlying nonlinear phase coupling of focused waves was examined using wavelet-based bicoherence and biphase, which can detect nonlinear phase coupling {{in a short time}} series. For <b>wave</b> <b>groups</b> with large initial steepness, as <b>wave</b> <b>groups</b> approached the focal location, the values of bicoherence between primary waves and its higher harmonics progressively increased to I and the corresponding biphase was gradually close to zero, suggesting that an extreme wave event can be produced by considering Stokes-like nonlinearity to very high-order. Furthermore, the fast change of bicoherence of focused <b>wave</b> <b>groups</b> indicates that the nonlinear energy transfer within focusing waves is faster than that of nonfocusing wave trains...|$|R

40|$|New {{laboratory}} {{data are}} presented on {{the influence of}} free long waves, bound long <b>waves</b> and <b>wave</b> <b>groups</b> on sediment transport in the surf and swash zones. As a result of the very significant difficulties in isolating and identifying the morphodynamic influences of long <b>waves</b> and <b>wave</b> <b>groups</b> in field conditions, a laboratory study was designed specifically to enable measurements of sediment transport that resolve these influences. The evolution of model sand beaches, each with the same initial plane slope, was measured for a range of wave conditions, firstly using monochromatic short waves. Subsequently, the monochromatic conditions were perturbed with free long waves and then substituted with bichromatic <b>wave</b> <b>groups</b> with the same mean energy flux. The beach profile changes and net cross-shore transport rates were extracted and compared for the different wave conditions, with and without long <b>waves</b> and <b>wave</b> <b>groups.</b> The experiments include a range of wave conditions, e. g. high-energy, moderate-energy, low-energy waves, which induce both spilling and plunging breakers and different turbulent intensities, and the beaches evolve to form classical accretive, erosive, and intermediate beach states. The data clearly demonstrate that free long waves influence surf zone morphodynamics and promote increased onshore sediment transport during accretive conditions and decreased offshore transport under erosive conditions. In contrast, <b>wave</b> <b>groups,</b> which can generate both forced and free long waves, generally reduce onshore transport during accretive conditions and increase offshore transport under erosive conditions. The influence of the free long <b>waves</b> and <b>wave</b> <b>groups</b> is consistent with the concept of the relative fall velocity, H/w(s) T, as a dominant parameter controlling net beach erosion or accretion. Free long waves tend to reduce H/w(s) T, promoting accretion, while <b>wave</b> <b>groups</b> tend to increase the effective H/w(s) T, promoting erosion. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Measurements are {{presented}} {{of the water}} particle kinematics of focused <b>wave</b> <b>groups</b> generated in the U. K. Coastal Research Facility. Single and repeated <b>wave</b> <b>groups</b> are considered at normal and 20 ° incidence to a 1 : 20 plane beach. The single focused <b>wave</b> <b>groups</b> model extreme transient events without the complication of reflections during the data acquisition process. A symmetry-based separation of harmonics method is used to interpret the water particle kinematics {{at the point of}} focus. Although the largest component is linear, there are also considerable second order kinematics terms (both low frequency and high frequency). Away from the free surface, the 2 nd order difference contribution to the kinematics is a return current opposed to the direction of wave advance. For repeated <b>wave</b> <b>groups,</b> the measured kinematics confirms the presence of a low frequency free wave, followed by higher frequency waves of the main group and trailing higher order harmonic waves. In the breaker and surf zones, there is also evidence of the saw-tooth behaviour of broken waves, followed by scatter due to breaker-induced turbulence.

In addition, the forced response is nearly resonant when the forcing has scales (k;) similar to the linearly most unstable mode. Thus, we suggest that <b>wave</b> <b>groups</b> may provide an initial perturbation necessary for the generation of shear instabilities of longshore currents and also act as a source of vortical motions on beaches where linear instabilities are completely damped. Data from the SUPERDUCK (1986) eld experiment were analyzed for the presence of spatially coherent <b>wave</b> <b>groups.</b> The analysis conrms that <b>wave</b> <b>groups</b> with periods and longshore spatial structures comparable to the observed shear wave motions were sometimes present on this open coast.

Using a multiple-scale expansion for two crossing <b>wave</b> <b>groups,</b> we examine the structure and magnitude of this wave-averaged set-up, {{which is part of}} a crossing wave pattern that behaves as a modulated partial standing wave: in space, it consists of a rapidly varying standing-wave pattern slowly modulated by the product of the envelopes of the two groups; in time, it grows and decays on the slow time scale associated with the translation of the groups. Whether this crossing wave pattern actually enhances the surface elevation at the point of focus depends on the phases of the linear <b>wave</b> <b>groups,</b> unlike the set-down, which is always negative and inherits the spatial structure of the underlying envelope(s).

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the low frequency motion of swash directly induced by <b>wave</b> <b>grouping</b> {{on a steep}} beach. A new experimental investigation is presented which considers the hydrodynamics of the inner surf zone and swash zone using vertical wave gauges and a run-up wire. Results for regular <b>waves,</b> <b>wave</b> <b>groups</b> and random <b>waves</b> are discussed, with particular reference to low frequency motions. The inner surf zone and swash zone {{are found to be}} unsaturated at incident short wave frequencies and, as a result, significant <b>wave</b> <b>grouping</b> is apparent at the shoreline. The low frequency motion in the surf zone is found to be in phase with the incident <b>wave</b> <b>grouping</b> and may therefore be regarded as a time varying set-up (Watson and Peregrine, 1992). The low frequency motion of the swash is shown to be an order of magnitude greater than that in the inner surf zone, inconsistent with cross-shore standing long waves, for which no evidence is found. We demonstrate that the low frequency motion of the shoreline provides an excellent approximation to the run-up of individual bores and therefore describes the run-up envelope. Spectral analysis shows that the low frequency motion of the swash is directly linked to the modulations in offshore wave height, i. e. the low frequency energy in the incident wave envelope, In addition, the random wave run-up spectra show an f(- 4) high frequency roll-off, as found by Huntley et al. (1977). The accumulated data show that, unless the surf zone is totally saturated, a significant proportion of the low frequency swash motion may be directly due to incident <b>wave</b> <b>grouping</b> and rot standing long waves.
