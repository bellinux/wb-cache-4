5|$|The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) {{requested}} {{the intervention of}} the International Association of Athletics Federations and the IOC; the samples were jointly reexamined by the <b>World</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Agency</b> and the IOC Sub-Commission on Doping and Biochemistry of Sport. In January 2003, the OCA announced that the IOC Medical Director had cleared Sunita of the doping charge and that appropriate action would be taken against the AGDCC. Both of Sunita's medals were reinstated on February 4, 2003, in a ceremony attended by the Secretary General of OCA Randhir Singh {{and the president of the}} IOA Suresh Kalmadi.|$|E

50|$|She {{became known}} in Norway, when she, {{as the first}} in Norway, was {{suspended}} from her sport for not having revealed her whereabouts to the national <b>anti-doping</b> <b>agency.</b> The suspension lasted from April to November 2007, and destroyed her form for the 2008 Summer Olympics.|$|R
5|$|Alberto Contador {{rode the}} Giro with full {{knowledge}} {{that he was to}} answer to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) regarding his positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, since his national federation cleared him of doping charges but both the UCI and the <b>World</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Agency</b> (WADA) chose to appeal the ruling. He rode and won with the most dominant Grand Tour performance of his career, and later rode a relatively normal and full 2011 season as his CAS date was continually pushed back. It was originally scheduled for June, to occur soon enough to decide conclusively his status prior to the 2011 Tour de France, but it was instead pushed back to August and then again to November.|$|E
5|$|An {{in-house}} {{waste water}} treatment and reuse facility, organic waste treatment facilities, and solar powered energy were among the environmentally friendly practices adopted by the Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games Organising Committee Headquarters (OC CWG Delhi 2010). At the same time, most of the transport fleet provided for the Games ran on green fuels such as battery electric vehicles and compressed natural gas. Residents and guests could also offset travel-accumulated carbon emissions by computing their footprint and then procuring carbon credits at the specifically created Green Games Carbon Neutrality Kiosk. The <b>World</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Agency</b> set up an anti-doping education hub {{in collaboration with the}} organisers. Construction of the Games Village as a whole however was marred by delays and organisational inefficiencies, leading to concerns as expressed by athletes and the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) (see below).|$|E
5|$|In 1967 the IOC began {{enacting}} {{drug testing}} protocols. They started by randomly testing athletes at the 1968 Winter Olympics. The first Winter Games athlete to test positive for a banned substance was Alois Schloder, a West German hockey player, but {{his team was}} still allowed to compete. During the 1970s testing outside of competition was escalated because it was found to deter athletes from using performance-enhancing drugs. The problem with testing during this time {{was a lack of}} standardisation of the test procedures, which undermined the credibility of the tests. It was not until the late 1980s that international sporting federations began to coordinate efforts to standardise the drug-testing protocols. The IOC took the lead in the fight against steroids when it established the independent <b>World</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Agency</b> (WADA) in November 1999.|$|E
50|$|On September 2, 2010, the US <b>Anti-doping</b> <b>Agency</b> {{suspended}} the retired Lukezic {{for two years}} for refusing to give a urine sample during an out-of-competition test on April 20, 2010, nearly 6 months after he had retired, and 1 year since his last competition.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, after {{returning}} from retirement, Lance Armstrong was accused by the French <b>anti-doping</b> <b>agency</b> of acting improperly by disappearing from {{the sight of the}} anti-doping investigator for 20 minutes.

5|$|Tameka Williams {{qualified}} {{to run in}} the 100 meter and 200 meter sprints. Williams, who would later compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics, was disqualified because she admitted that she used a banned substance. She voluntarily told her Olympic committee about using a banned substance, and it was announced on July 29 that she would not compete. Williams admitted to using a drug named Blast Off Red, which is typically used to enhance the performance of racehorses and greyhounds. Williams had posted on Facebook that she was innocent and had passed drug tests prior to the Olympics. While the drug is not listed as prohibited by the <b>World</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Agency,</b> it falls into the category of veterinary medicine and therefore its use is not permitted.|$|E
5|$|The IOC has retested nearly 500 doping {{samples that}} were {{collected}} at the 2006 Turin Games. In 2014, the Estonian Olympic Committee was notified by the IOC that a retested sample from cross-country skier Kristina Šmigun had tested positive. On 24 October 2016, the <b>World</b> <b>Anti-Doping</b> <b>Agency</b> Athletes' Commission stated that Šmigun, who won two gold medals at the Turin Games, faces a Court of Arbitration for Sport hearing {{before the end of}} October. If Šmigun were to be stripped of her gold medals, Kateřina Neumannová of Czech Republic could be elevated to gold in the 7.5 + 7.5 km double pursuit event. Marit Bjørgen of Norway could acquire a seventh gold medal in the 10 km classical event.|$|E

50|$|In 2013, further {{amendments}} to the Code were approved, doubling the sanction for a first offence where intentional doping is established, but allowing for more lenient sanctions for inadvertent rule violations or for athletes co-operating with <b>anti-doping</b> <b>agencies.</b> The updated code came into effect on January 1, 2015.|$|R

50|$|Melinte first {{wanted to}} be a gymnast or a ballerina, but did not have {{adequate}} conditions for training. She then played handball before changing to athletics.

50|$|Salbutamol is {{commonly}} used to treat asthma symptoms, and is allowed {{to be used in}} cycle racing if the cyclist can provide a medical prescription for the substance. It is alleged that the International Cycling Union gave Pereiro retroactive permission to use the substance on medical grounds after the positive tests. The French <b>anti-doping</b> <b>agency</b> questions the veracity of the medical grounds. It demanded that Pereiro verify the grounds for the use of salbutamol within a week.|$|R
50|$|U.S. federal {{prosecutors}} pursued allegations of doping by Armstrong from 2010 to 2012. The effort convened {{a grand jury}} to investigate doping charges, including taking statements under oath from Armstrong's former team members and other associates; met with officials from France, Belgium, Spain, and Italy; and requested samples from the French <b>anti-doping</b> <b>agency.</b> The investigation was led by federal agent Jeff Novitzky, who also investigated suspicions of steroid use by baseball players Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens.|$|R
