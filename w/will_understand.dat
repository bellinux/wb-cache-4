5|$|The {{chief of}} police reveals himself as Ushi-oni and starts eating the humans trapped in the shelter. Sagisaka sacrifices himself to push his {{daughter}} away from Ushi-oni's attack. Otoha confronts and, in a climatic sequence, his conviction resurrects his Yurine, which restores Otoha as a karas and he slays Ushi-oni. While karas from other cities observe the showdown between Otoha and Eko, Homura steps in to help Otoha. Otoha carries out Nue's request to kill him and his brother, depriving Eko of his new power source and stopping his entire scheme. Confronting the depowered Eko on equal terms, Otoha finally defeats him. Eko claims Otoha <b>will</b> <b>understand</b> his reasons after 400 years as a karas. Despite defending his human body and Yurine from soldiers ordered by the Deputy Governor to shoot them, Otoha proclaims himself as Tokyo's appointed agent, who will protect all its inhabitants. While Hinaru stays behind in Shinjuku as it is being rebuilt, Kure and Yoshiko have had enough and leave for the countryside.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to exactly define the single function or goal of {{the phenomenon of the}} Mafia. Until the early 1980s, mafia was generally considered a unique Sicilian cultural attitude and form of power, excluding any corporate or organisational dimension. Some even used it as a defensive attempt to render the Mafia benign and romantic — not a criminal association, but the sum of Sicilian values that outsiders never <b>will</b> <b>understand.</b>|$|E

25|$|According to a {{story in}} the Āyācana Sutta (Samyutta Nikaya VI.1)— a scripture found in the Pāli and other — {{immediately}} after his awakening, the Buddha debated whether or not he should teach the Dharma to others. He was concerned that humans were so overpowered by ignorance, greed and hatred that they could never recognise the path, which is subtle, deep and hard to grasp. However, in the story, Brahmā Sahampati convinced him, arguing that at least some <b>will</b> <b>understand</b> it. The Buddha relented, and agreed to teach.|$|E

But she adds that there is evil {{in all of them}} and Stewart must never do this again. Then, to bury the hatchet, she gives Stewart another video. Stewart takes {{the rest of the day}} off sick, and again fast forwards through the faith programme.

Those designing and planning the curriculum are expected to work backwards once an outcome has been decided upon; they must determine what knowledge and skills will be required to reach the outcome.|$|E

25|$|Although most {{electrical}} engineers <b>will</b> <b>understand</b> basic circuit theory (that is {{the interactions of}} elements such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and inductors in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the work they do. For example, quantum mechanics and solid state physics might be relevant to an engineer working on VLSI (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even circuit theory may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use off-the-shelf components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for {{electrical engineers}} are reflected in university programs, which emphasize strong numerical skills, computer literacy, {{and the ability to}} understand the technical language and concepts that relate to electrical engineering.|$|E

She believes that Kōichi, Shige and Keizō don't care {{how hard it was}} for their father when he lost their mother. Kyōko believes that strangers and even Noriko would've been more respectful towards her. Noriko responds that while she understands Kyoko's disappointment with her siblings, she also explains that everyone has their own life to lead and that the drift between parents and children is inevitable.
