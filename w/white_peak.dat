5|$|The Peak District is an upland area in England at the {{southern}} end of the Pennines. It is mostly in northern Derbyshire, but also includes parts of Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Staffordshire, West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire. An area of great diversity, it is split into the northern Dark Peak, where most of the moorland is found and the geology is gritstone, {{the southern}} <b>White</b> <b>Peak,</b> where most of the population lives and the geology is mainly limestone, and the South West Peak, with landscapes similar to both the Dark and White Peaks.|$|E

500|$|Natural England {{divides the}} Peak District {{landscape}} into three National Character Areas (NCAs): the Dark Peak in the north, the <b>White</b> <b>Peak</b> {{to the south}} and South West Peak. Most moorland and gritstone escarpments are in the Dark Peak and most settlements, farmland and limestone gorges are in the <b>White</b> <b>Peak.</b> The South West Peak contains some gritstone edges and moorland similar to the Dark Peak but the landscape has farmland and pastured valleys similar to the <b>White</b> <b>Peak.</b> These landscapes extend beyond the national park boundaries. High gritstone moorland extends into the South Pennines to the north. The Derbyshire Peak Fringe and Lower Derwent, Churnet Valley, some parts of the Manchester Pennine Fringe and Yorkshire Southern Pennine Fringe form the outer fringes and foothills of the Peak District, and are sometimes considered to be part of it, especially the Churnet and lower Derwent valleys.|$|E

500|$|The gritstone and shale of the Dark Peak {{supports}} heather moorland and {{blanket bog}} environments, with rough sheep pasture and grouse shooting being the main land uses. The limestone plateaux of the <b>White</b> <b>Peak</b> are more intensively farmed, with mainly dairy usage of improved pastures. The gritstone {{landscape of the}} South West Peak also supports moorland environments although the landscape supports both farming and grouse shooting. Woodland forms around 8% of the Peak National Park. Natural broad-leaved woodland {{is found in the}} steep-sided, narrow dales of the <b>White</b> <b>Peak</b> and the deep cloughs of the Dark Peak and South West Peak, while reservoir margins often have coniferous plantations.|$|E
500|$|The moorland plateau of the Dark Peak, {{the high}} ridges of the <b>White</b> <b>Peak</b> and the South West Peak are {{the sources of}} many rivers. In a report for the Manchester Corporation, the {{engineer}} John Frederick Bateman wrote in 1846: ...|$|E

500|$|There are no canals {{within the}} National Park {{boundary}} (though the Standedge Tunnels on the Huddersfield Narrow Canal run underneath the extreme {{north of the}} park). [...] Waters from the Dark Peak fed the Ashton Canal, and Huddersfield Narrow Canal, waters from the <b>White</b> <b>Peak</b> fed the disused Cromford Canal, and waters from the South West Peak fed the Macclesfield Canal. Outside the National Park, but within the general area, the Peak Forest Canal was built to bring lime from the quarries at Dove Holes for the construction industry. The canal terminated at Bugsworth and the journey was completed using the Peak Forest Tramway.|$|E
500|$|The Peak District {{provides}} {{opportunities for}} {{many types of}} outdoor activity, {{both inside and outside}} the National Park. An extensive network of public footpaths and numerous long-distance trails, over [...] in total, as well as large open-access areas, are available for hillwalking and hiking. [...] The Pennine Way traverses the Dark Peak from Edale to the Park's northern boundary just south of Standedge. Bridleways are commonly used by mountain bikers, as well as horse riders. Some of the long-distance trails in the <b>White</b> <b>Peak,</b> such as the Tissington Trail and High Peak Trail, re-use former railway lines; they are well used by walkers, horse riders and cyclists.|$|E
500|$|During the 1970s, the Dark Peak {{regularly}} recorded {{more than}} 70 days of snowfall each year. Since then {{the number of}} snowfall days has decreased markedly. Frost cover is seen for 20–30% of the winter on the moors of the Dark Peak and for 10% on the <b>White</b> <b>Peak,</b> and the hills of the National Park still see periods of long continuous snow cover in some winters. For example, a snowfall in mid-December 2009 on the summits {{of some of the}} hills created snow patches that lasted in some cases until May 2010. In the same winter, some of the area's passes, such as the A635 (Saddleworth Moor) and [...] A57 (Snake Pass), were closed because of lying snow for almost a month.|$|E

60|$|They pushed on.

Between them and the water stupendous forest shrouded all the valley, save where an oblong of pale verdure ran back from the fringe of boulders and was traversed by the frothing streak of a river whose roar came up hoarsely across the pines in long pulsations.|$|E
