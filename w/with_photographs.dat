5|$|Apart {{from the}} 20 rather amateurish artistic {{photography}} events arranged by Aage Remfeldt between 1946 and 1976 at Charlottenborg, Denmark had few photographic exhibitions until the 1960s.

Another positive influence was Keld Helmer-Petersen's book Fragments of a City <b>with</b> <b>photographs</b> of fire escapes and artistically silhouetted cranes taken {{while he was a}} student at Chicago's Institute of Design, some of which were published in the magazine Perspectiv.|$|E

The promotion for the film, released in France in March 1953, drew {{more attention to}} Bardot's bikinis than to the film itself. By the time the film was released in the United States in 1958 it was re-titled Manina, the Girl in the Bikini. Bardot was also photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the 1953 Cannes Film Festival. Working {{with her husband and}} agent Roger Vadim she garnered significant attention <b>with</b> <b>photographs</b> of her wearing a bikini on every beach in the south of France.|$|E

Shot in early 1992 in New York City and Miami, the locations ranged from hotels and burlesque theaters, to the streets of Miami. The photographs were stolen before publishing, but were quickly recovered.|$|E

5|$|The public's {{thirst for}} news and {{information}} was in part satisfied by news magazines, which were dedicated to reporting the war. They included amongst others The War Illustrated, The Illustrated War News, and The War Pictorial, and were lavishly filled <b>with</b> <b>photographs</b> and illustrations, regardless of their target audience. Magazines were produced for all classes, and ranged both in price and tone. Many otherwise famous writers contributed towards these publications, of which H.G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle and Rudyard Kipling were three examples. Editorial guidelines varied; in cheaper publications especially it was considered more important {{to create a sense}} of patriotism than to relay up-to-the-minutes news of developments of the front. Stories of German atrocities were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|After {{two years}} of research, the Hrant Dink Foundation {{published}} a book, some 400 pages long, describing the current situation of seized assets and properties of the Armenian community. With the help of government deed and title records, {{the members of the}} Hrant Dink foundation have uncovered the title records of all the properties owned by various foundations and have produced the book replete <b>with</b> <b>photographs,</b> charts, maps, and other illustrations which describe the seized properties and assets and its current status. The Hrant Dink foundation states that 661 properties in Istanbul alone were confiscated by the Turkish government, leaving only 580 of the 1,328 properties owned by the 53 Armenian foundations (schools, churches, hospitals, etc.). The current circumstances of the remaining 87 could not be determined. Out of the 661 confiscated properties, 143 (21.6%) have been returned to the Armenian foundation.|$|E
