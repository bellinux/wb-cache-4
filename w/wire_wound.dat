25|$|Around 1832, Hippolyte Pixii {{improved}} the magneto {{by using a}} <b>wire</b> <b>wound</b> horseshoe, with the extra coils of conductor generating more current, but it was AC. André-Marie Ampère suggested a means of converting current from Pixii's magneto to DC using a rocking switch. Later segmented commutators were used to produce direct current.|$|E
25|$|The 60 pounder {{was a heavy}} field gun or ‘gun of position’ {{designed}} to be towed by either a horse team or mechanical vehicle. It had a quick firing recoil, meaning that the carriage did not move when the gun fired. The barrel was a <b>wire</b> <b>wound</b> A tube in a jacket with a screw breech. It fired a separate round (i.e. shell and bagged cartridge were loaded separately). The lower carriage comprised a box trail. It was designed for one-man laying with both traverse and elevation sights and controls on the left.|$|E
25|$|Several {{traditional}} {{players have}} used hammers that differ substantially {{from those in}} common use today. Paul Van Arsdale (b. 1920), a player from upstate New York, uses flexible hammers made from hacksaw blades, with leather-covered wooden blocks attached to the ends (these are modeled after the hammers used by his grandfather, Jesse Martin). The Irish player John Rea (1915–1983) used hammers made of thick steel <b>wire,</b> <b>wound</b> with wool. He made these himself from old bicycle spokes. Billy Bennington (1900–1986), a player from Norfolk in England, used cane hammers bound with wool.|$|E

5000|$|The winding {{is made of}} two {{separate}} <b>wires</b> <b>wound</b> in opposing directions along an insulating form and connected in parallel at the ends. Since there are {{the same number of}} turns of wire in either direction, the magnetic fields of the two wires cancel each other out, so the coil has little inductance; and since adjacent turns of the two wires are at approximately the same voltage, there is little parasitic capacitance between the turns.|$|R
25|$|In World War I, the Imperial German Navy {{employed}} FL-boats (Fernlenkboote) against coastal shipping. These {{were driven}} by internal combustion engines, and controlled remotely from a shore station through several miles of <b>wire</b> <b>wound</b> on a spool on the boat. An aircraft {{was used to}} signal directions to the shore station. EMBs carried a high explosive charge in the bow and traveled at speeds of thirty knots. The Soviet Red Army used remotely controlled teletanks during the 1930s in the Winter War against Finland and {{the early stages of}} World War II. A teletank is controlled by radio from a control tank at a distance of 500 to 1,500 meters, the two constituting a telemechanical group. The Red Army fielded at least two teletank battalions {{at the beginning of the}} Great Patriotic War. There were also remotely controlled cutters and experimental remotely controlled planes in the Red Army.|$|E

2500|$|In the UK, older {{electrical}} consumer units (also called fuse boxes) are fitted {{either with}} semi-enclosed (rewirable) fuses [...] or cartridge fuses [...] (Fuse wire is commonly supplied to consumers as short lengths of 5A-, 15A- and 30A-rated <b>wire</b> <b>wound</b> {{on a piece}} of cardboard.) [...] Modern consumer units usually contain miniature circuit breakers (MCBs) instead of fuses, though cartridge fuses are sometimes still used, as in some applications MCBs are prone to nuisance tripping.|$|E
50|$|The Brennan torpedo had two <b>wires</b> <b>wound</b> around {{internal}} drums. Shore-based steam winches {{pulled the}} wires, which spun the drums {{and drove the}} propellers. An operator controlled the relative speeds of the winches, providing guidance. Such systems were used for coastal defence of the British homeland and colonies from 1887 to 1903 and were purchased by, and under the control of, the Army {{as opposed to the}} Navy. Speed was about 25 kn for over 2,400 m.|$|R

40|$|Todays power {{resistors}} {{and heating}} elements are usually made of metal <b>wires</b> <b>wound</b> around a core. Due to the non-adjustable resistitivy of typical resistance alloys these components may become quite large in dimensions {{and therefore the}} overall size determining components in complex electric devices. Furthermore, prices of metals are rising over the last years. Pursuing an alternative material concept promises wide market opportunities. Glass-carbon composite materials are such systems. Fraunhofer IKTS has adapted powder injection molding for this material system enabling a mass production technology of complex shaped electrical conducting glass-carbon components...|$|R
2500|$|The {{rotating}} armature {{consists of}} one or more coils of <b>wire</b> <b>wound</b> around a laminated, magnetically [...] "soft" [...] ferromagnetic core. Current from the brushes flows through the commutator and one winding of the armature, making it a temporary magnet (an electromagnet). The magnetic field produced by the armature interacts with a stationary magnetic field produced by either PMs or another winding (a field coil), as part of the motor frame. The force between the two magnetic fields tends to rotate the motor shaft. The commutator switches power to the coils as the rotor turns, keeping the magnetic poles of the rotor from ever fully aligning with the magnetic poles of the stator field, so that the rotor never stops (like a compass needle does), but rather keeps rotating as long as power is applied.|$|E
2500|$|A {{potentiometer}} or pot is a three-terminal resistor with a {{continuously adjustable}} tapping point controlled by rotation of a shaft or knob or by a linear slider. [...] It {{is called a}} potentiometer {{because it can be}} connected as an adjustable voltage divider to provide a variable potential at the terminal connected to the tapping point. A volume control for an audio device is a common use of a potentiometer. [...] A typical low power potentiometer (see drawing) is constructed of a flat resistance element (B) of carbon composition, metal film, or conductive plastic, with a springy phosphor bronze wiper contact (C) which moves along the surface. [...] An alternate construction is resistance <b>wire</b> <b>wound</b> on a form, with the wiper sliding axially along the coil. [...] These have lower resolution, since as the wiper moves the resistance changes in steps equal to the resistance of a single turn.|$|E
2500|$|The Colorado Springs {{apparatus}} {{consisted of}} a 51-foot-diameter (15.5m) Tesla transformer composed of a secondary winding (L2) of 50 turns of heavy <b>wire</b> <b>wound</b> on a 6-foot-high (2m) circular wooden [...] "fence" [...] around {{the periphery of the}} lab, and a single-turn primary (L1) either mounted on the fence or buried in the ground under it. The primary was connected to a bank of oil capacitors (C1) to make a tuned circuit, with a rotary spark gap (SG), powered by 20 to 40 kilovolts from a powerful utility step-up transformer (T). The top of the secondary was connected to the 100-turn 8ft (2.4m) diameter [...] "extra" [...] or [...] "resonator" [...] coil (L3) {{in the center of the}} room. Its high-voltage end was connected to a telescoping 143-foot (43.6m) [...] "antenna" [...] rod with a 30-inch (1m) metal ball on top which could project through the roof of the lab. [...] By cranking the rod up or down he could adjust the capacitance in the circuit of the extra coil, tuning it to resonance with the rest of the circuit.|$|E

40|$|As {{a driving}} device, wire- pulley system is employed. It enables {{the weight of}} a multi joint robot arm to lighten and to have {{flexibility}} in motion. One link is driven by a pair of <b>wires</b> <b>wounded</b> by two motors or a couple of a motor and an electromagnetic clutch. The input forces that originate in the tension of the wire are incorporated in the mathematical model for the robot arm that has three degrees of freedom. LQI control is applied on the model and the experiments are performed bases on the strategy. Simulation results show that this system has the antagonistic effect...|$|R
2500|$|Today Schumann {{resonances}} are recorded at many separate research {{stations around the}} world. The sensors used to measure Schumann resonances typically consist of two horizontal magnetic inductive coils for measuring the north-south and east-west components of the magnetic field, and a vertical electric dipole antenna for measuring the vertical component of the electric field. A typical passband of the instruments is 3–100Hz. [...] The Schumann resonance electric field amplitude (~300 microvolts per meter) is {{much smaller than the}} static fair-weather electric field (~150 V/m) in the atmosphere. Similarly, the amplitude of the Schumann resonance magnetic field (~1 picotesla) is many orders of magnitude smaller than the Earth's magnetic field (~30–50 microteslas). Specialized receivers and antennas are needed to detect and record Schumann resonances. The electric component is commonly measured with a ball antenna, suggested by Ogawa et al., in 1966, connected to a high-impedance amplifier. The magnetic induction coils typically consist of tens- to hundreds-of-thousands of turns of <b>wire</b> <b>wound</b> around a core of very high magnetic permeability.|$|E
2500|$|The ampullae are round {{when seen}} from the front, with a {{flattened}} body giving convex faces and a small neck, often with a fitting round the neck for a chain or cord by which they could be suspended, or perhaps worn. There are records of similar blessed objects, or eulogia, being hung on the bedpost for protection from demons at night, and the oil, or just the relic, {{was believed to be}} able to heal the sick when applied to them. [...] Often there is a strip in a different metal running round the edge of the faces and up the sides of the neck, with little rings for a suspension cord. [...] In the Monza examples these strips are secured by <b>wire</b> <b>wound</b> rather untidily round the neck. [...] A diameter for the main body of about 5–7cm is typical, and in a side view the body swells to a maximum thickness of about 3cm. [...] Those at Monza are in generally good condition, but those from Bobbio and other examples such as the one at Dumbarton Oaks are flattened and damaged; they are now mostly black in colour.|$|E

50|$|The steel {{superstructure}} includes the bridge, rigged mast, and cable. The main {{span of the}} bridge, which is stretched between two poles, has a length of 450 meters. The main span is a trapezoid 33 meters wide. The bridge has a walkway along its side. The bridge has two main pylons 3 x 4.50 metres. This serves to hold the tension of the cable and weight into the pylon pier. The 121 - 167 mm diameter cables consist of many small <b>wires</b> <b>wound</b> together. The cables vary in length from 50 to 223 meters can absorb the tension for 1,500 - 3,000 tons.|$|R
5000|$|Jumble winding or {{scramble}} winding {{is a type}} of winding of a <b>wire</b> randomly <b>wound</b> on a bobbin. In {{this type}} of winding, the <b>wire</b> is not <b>wound</b> layer by layer with insulation placed in between. In fact, it is wound full depth, and randomly until the number of turns have been reached. The only insulation throughout is the insulation on the wire and that of the bobbin.

40|$|Additional contributor: Demoz Gebre-Egziabher (faculty mentor). Control of {{satellite}} pointing direction {{is essential to}} all modern satellites. Whether the satellites purpose is research, surveillance, or for public use, on-board antenna’s must constantly be communicating with ground stations.

Torque coils consist of copper <b>wiring</b> <b>wound</b> many times and a current running through the wires to generate a magnetic field.
