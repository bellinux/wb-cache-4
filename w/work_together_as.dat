5|$|Members of the Westerfield Club hire Brisco County, Jr. (Bruce Campbell), {{the son of}} {{the slain}} U.S. Marshal, to track and re-capture Bly (Billy Drago) and his gang. The Westerfield Club's timid lawyer, Socrates Poole (Christian Clemenson) relays {{instructions}} and financial support to Brisco. Another bounty hunter, Lord Bowler (Julius Carry), who is known for his expert tracking skills, also hopes to capture Bly. Bitter over the elder County's fame, Bowler treats Brisco as a rival. The two men often find themselves reluctantly joining forces to achieve a common goal. Later in the series, Brisco and Bowler <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>as</b> partners and friends.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode of}} Sense8 {{was written by}} the Wachowskis and Straczynski in the first season; in the second season, Lilly Wachowski took {{a break from the}} show, and the scripts were written by just Lana Wachowski and Straczynski. Most of the episodes of the two seasons were {{directed}} by the Wachowskis (or just Lana, in the second season), with the remainder being divided between their frequent collaborators James McTeigue, Tom Tykwer and Dan Glass. Lilly's break during the second season marked {{the first time in the}} sisters' career that they did not <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>as</b> a writing and directing unit. Sense8 was filmed almost entirely on location in a multitude of cities around the world.|$|E
5|$|Mills {{moved into}} {{management}} {{on the advice}} of John Barnwell when being appointed the player-manager of Grantham Town in July 1996. Darron Gee joined him as his assistant, and the two went on to frequently <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>as</b> a management team. Mills' managerial and playing debut for Grantham was in a 3–0 home defeat to Grimsby Town in the quarter-final of the Lincolnshire Senior Cup on 13 August 1996, and he scored his first goal for them in a 3–2 win home over Evesham United on 21 September. He led the team to fourth place in the Southern League Midland Division in 1996–97, missing out on second place and thus promotion by one point. He played regularly this season, making 46 appearances and scoring three goals.|$|E

5|$|After a {{short time}} in jail, they are {{released}} by a social worker named Gabriel, whom Homer mistakes for an angel sent from Heaven. Gabriel moves in with the family to help them be functional again. After observing the family's quirks, Gabriel takes the family to a forest and diagnoses the family's problems accordingly: Marge tries to prove her self-worth to the family by medicating them with food, Bart is addicted to doing crazy stunts for attention, and Homer is simply a drunken buffoon. Gabriel then sets up a challenge to teach the Simpsons the importance of teamwork by setting up a picnic basket in a tree. The object is for the family to <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>as</b> a team to get it down. After a harrowing rescue involving Bart driving the family car and Homer nearly becoming prey for wild predators, the Simpsons succeed and Gabriel congratulates them on working {{together as a family}} and becoming functional during their drive home.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} between {{the male and female}} of a species apart from their sex organs is called sexual dimorphism, and in this regard little variance exists among the canids. A study of dire wolf remains dated 15,360–14,310YBP and taken from one pit that focused on skull length, canine tooth size, and lower molar length showed little dimorphism, {{similar to that of the}} gray wolf, indicating that dire wolves lived in monogamous pairs. Their large size and highly carnivorous dentition supports the proposal that the dire wolf was a predator that fed on large prey. To kill ungulates larger than themselves, the African wild dog, the dhole, and the gray wolf depend on their jaws as they cannot use their forelimbs to grapple with prey, and they <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>as</b> a pack consisting of an alpha pair and their offspring from the current and previous years. It can be assumed that dire wolves lived in packs of relatives that were led by an alpha pair. Large and social carnivores would have been successful at defending carcasses of prey trapped in the tar pits from smaller solitary predators, and thus the most likely to become trapped themselves. The many C.d.guildayi and Smilodon remains found in the tar pits suggests that both were social predators.|$|E
5|$|John {{was born}} to Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine on 24 December 1166. Henry had {{inherited}} significant territories along the Atlantic seaboard—Anjou, Normandy and England—and expanded his empire by conquering Brittany. Henry married the powerful Eleanor of Aquitaine, who reigned over the Duchy of Aquitaine and had a tenuous claim to Toulouse and Auvergne in southern France, {{in addition to being}} the former wife of Louis VII of France. The result was the Angevin Empire, named after Henry's paternal title as Count of Anjou and, more specifically, its seat in Angers. The Empire, however, was inherently fragile: although all the lands owed allegiance to Henry, the disparate parts each had their own histories, traditions and governance structures. As one moved south through Anjou and Aquitaine, the extent of Henry's power in the provinces diminished considerably, scarcely resembling the modern concept of an empire at all. Some of the traditional ties between parts of the empire such as Normandy and England were slowly dissolving over time. It was unclear {{what would happen to the}} empire on Henry's death. Although the custom of primogeniture, under which an eldest son would inherit all his father's lands, was slowly becoming more widespread across Europe, it was less popular amongst the Norman kings of England. Most believed that Henry would divide the empire, giving each son a substantial portion, and hoping that his children would continue to <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>as</b> allies after his death. To complicate matters, much of the Angevin empire was held by Henry only as a vassal of the King of France of the rival line of the House of Capet. Henry had often allied himself with the Holy Roman Emperor against France, making the feudal relationship even more challenging.|$|E

25|$|In Alliance, {{there are}} three teams, each limited to two players, both of which use the same persona.

This mode encourages players to <b>work</b> <b>together,</b> <b>as</b> teammates can help each other or they can assassinate their targets simultaneously.
