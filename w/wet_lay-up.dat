One of the woven fabrics was non-hybrid glass using E-glass fibre yams in both warp and weft (fill) directions, the second fabric was a hybrid woven fabric using E-glass fibre yams in the warp direction and R-glass fibre yams in the weft direction. Destructive tests such as interlaminar shear, flexural and uniaxial tension tests were carried out on two different categories. In the first category four different fibre volume fractions of nonhybrid E-glass woven fabric reinforced epoxy resin laminates have been investigated. In the second category hybrid and non-hybrid woven fabric reinforced epoxy resin laminates for similar fibre volume fractions have been investigated. Acoustic Emission (AE) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were employed as nondestructive tools to predict and characterise the damage events in the composites. All laminates were fabricated using the <b>wet</b> hand <b>lay-up</b> process to laminate the fabric layers prior to curing. Epoxy resin (L 20 -SL set) was the sole matrix used for all composites.

40|$|Bonded {{repair of}} {{concrete}} structures with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) systems is increasingly being {{accepted as a}} cost-efficient and structurally viable method of rapid rehabilitation of concrete structures. However, the relationships between long-term performance attributes, service-life, and details of the installation process {{are not easy to}} quantify. Accordingly, there is currently a lack of generally accepted construction specifications, making it difficult for the field engineer to certify the adequacy of the construction process. ^ The objective of the present study, as part of the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 10 - 59 B, was to investigate the effect of surface preparation on the behavior of <b>wet</b> <b>lay-up</b> FRP repair systems and consequently develop rational thresholds that provide sufficient performance. ^ The research program was comprised of both experimental and analytical work for <b>wet</b> <b>lay-up</b> FRP applications. The experimental work included flexure testing of sixty-seven (67) reinforced concrete beams and bond testing of ten (10) reinforced concrete blocks. Four different parameters were studied: surface roughness, surface flatness, surface voids and bug holes, and surface cracks/cuts. The findings were analyzed from various aspects and compared with the data available in the literature. As part of the analytical work, finite element models of the flexural specimens with surface flaws were developed using ANSYS. The purpose of this part was to extend the parametric study on the effects of concrete surface flaws and verify the experimental results based on nonlinear finite element analysis. ^ Test results showed that surface roughness {{does not appear to have}} a significant influence on the overall performance of the <b>wet</b> <b>lay-up</b> FRP systems with or without adequate anchorage, and whether failure was by debonding or rupture of FRP. Both experimental and analytical results for surface flatness proved that peaks on concrete surface, in the range studied, do not have a significant effect on the performance of <b>wet</b> <b>lay-up</b> FRP systems. However, valleys of particular size could reduce the strength of <b>wet</b> <b>lay-up</b> FRP systems.

40|$|In <b>wet</b> <b>lay-up</b> process, dry fiber {{sheets are}} {{saturated}} with a polymer {{and applied to}} the concrete surface by hand. This causes relatively large variation in properties of the cured FRP composite material.

In addition, the stiffness of FRP changes during debonding process due to different amount of concrete attached to the debonded FRP at different locations. It is also inevitable to have considerable variations in the strength of concrete. Therefore, the behaviour of FRP bonded concrete members varies among specimens even when the same materials are used. The variation of localized FRP stiffness and concrete strength can be combined in a single parameter as variation of the localized interfacial fracture energy. In an effort to effectively model the effects of the variation of interfacial fracture energy on the load versus deflection responses of FRP bonded concrete specimens subjected to Mode I and Mode II loading, a random white noise using a one-dimensional standard Brownian motion is added to the governing equations, yielding stochastic differential equations.

A {{key component of}} NSTX-U is the fabrication of a new, higher field centerstack (CS). In order to simultaneously provide robust joints between {{the inner and outer}} legs of the Toroidal Field Coils (TF) and minimize radial build, the NSTX-U CS design requires that the Ohmic Heating solenoid (OH) be wound directly on the inner TF bundle. To protect the OH against thermal expansion stress during scenarios where the inner TF bundle is hot but the OH is relatively cool, the completed CS will have a 0. 100 inch annular gap between the outer diameter of the TF bundle and the inner diameter of the OH solenoid. "Aquapour", a proprietary material produced by the Advanced Ceramics Manufacturing Company will be used during manufacture to produce this gap. After the TF bundle is vacuum pressure impregnated and cured, a cylindrical "clam shell" mold will be assembled around it, and a slurry of powdered Aquapour and water will be pumped into the annular space between the mold and TF bundle.
