5|$|The Demi-Virgin, {{like most}} of Hopwood's farces, was commercially successful, but had no lasting {{literary}} significance. Even as a popular entertainment, the play's appeal was limited by cultural context. Before World War I, in a time with more conservative sexual mores, the production {{would have been more}} likely to be suppressed. A decade later, the sexual attitudes conveyed in the play would be considered too unsophisticated for Broadway. As early as the end of 1921, Woods was suggesting a seven-year hiatus in the production of bedroom farces, saying the genre had become stale. In 1925, Hopwood confessed to the audience at another play that he thought The Demi-Virgin <b>was</b> <b>boring</b> and that he was tired of writing faddish entertainment. The play's script was never published and no movie adaptation was made.|$|E
5|$|A second prototype, {{completed}} {{near the}} end of 1978, had only about eight rooms, a single dragon, and two objects, and Robinett recognized that the game, though demonstrating what he had set out to do, <b>was</b> <b>boring.</b> He put the game aside for a few months and came back with additional ideas to improve the game, finishing it by June 1979. Two changes that Robinett added were the possibility of being eaten by the dragon, as well as the means to reset the avatar if this should happen, and the addition of the sword object, which could kill the dragon. Robinett found the various possibilities that arose from this combination of elements improved the excitement of the game, and subsequently made three dragons, reusing the same code for the behavior of all three. The magnet was created to work around a potential situation where the player could drop an object into a wall space and make it irretrievable.|$|E

This is a world of fools and brutes in which we live, a world of idiotic traditions, imbecile limitations, cowardice, habit, greed and mean cruelty.

500|$|Stereogum {{referred}} to the opening scene of the episode as [...] "Rudd generally being awesome." [...] Cortney Martin, writing for the Houston Chronicle, was mixed overall. While being complimentary towards Rudd's performance and Greenfield's reappearance, the reviewer disliked the mystery of Desmond's missing tapes, stating, [...] "the mystery of the week {{turns out to be}} the lamest non-mystery of the show's entire run, I think." [...] The reviewer opined that the subplot involving the Fitzpatricks <b>was</b> <b>boring</b> but that Marino's reappearance was a good surprise. Brian Raftery of Idolator believed that Rudd's character could have been based on a number of different real-life figures but guessed Courtney Love and Matthew Sweet as potential influences.|$|E

Both writers gave Survivor Series 1993 a [...] "C" [...] rating and viewed the Family Feud match as the worst on the card. Matt Peddycord, writing for 411mania.com, gave the event a 5.5 out of 10 rating. He pointed to the crowd's chant of [...] "We want Doink!"

500|$|During the 1950s and 1960s Coward {{continued}} to write musicals and plays. After the Ball, his 1953 adaptation of Lady Windermere's Fan, {{was the last}} musical he premiered in the West End; his last two musicals were first produced on Broadway. Sail Away (1961), set on a luxury cruise liner, was Coward's most successful post-war musical, with productions in America, Britain and Australia. The Girl Who Came to Supper, a musical adaptation of The Sleeping Prince (1963), ran for only three months. He directed the successful 1964 Broadway musical adaptation of Blithe Spirit, called High Spirits. Coward's late plays include a farce, Look After Lulu! (1959), and a tragi-comic study of old age, Waiting in the Wings (1960), {{both of which were}} successful despite [...] "critical disdain". Coward argued that the primary purpose of a play was to entertain, and he made no attempt at modernism, which he felt <b>was</b> <b>boring</b> to the audience although fascinating to the critics. His comic novel, Pomp and Circumstance (1960), about life in a tropical British colony, met with more critical success.|$|E

The book was published in Moscow in [...] "Astrel" [...] publishing house. The book used photos from the personal archive of the author. Design of the Russian edition met with sharp criticism of the art director of the publishing house Penguin Books Paul Buckley: [...] "Everything here <b>is</b> <b>boring.</b> Photo <b>is</b> <b>boring,</b> font <b>is</b> <b>boring,</b> layout <b>is</b> <b>boring</b> and who may be interested in such a book In the US?

500|$|Gareth McLean, who {{reviewed}} {{a preview}} screening for The Guardians TV and radio weblog, appreciated the episode's use of [...] "the disaster movie template" [...] {{and came to}} a favourable overall conclusion: [...] "For the most part, The Voyage of the Damned is absolutely smashing." [...] Its main flaw, in his view, was the [...] "blank and insipid" [...] acting of Kylie Minogue. James Walton of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode a positive review, summarising it as [...] "a winning mixture of wild imagination and careful writerly calculation". Alex Clark of The Observer commented that the death toll was rather high, but she still thought the episode was [...] "an oasis of cheeky nonsense and careless invention". Harry Venning of The Stage concluded his positive review of the episode by stating it [...] "was well up to Doctor Whos impeccably high standards". Doctor Who Magazine placed two of the deaths in the episode in its list of the top 100 deaths {{in the history of the}} show. Bannakaffalatta's death, a self-sacrifice to save the Doctor's party, was placed in the [...] "top 20 tearjerkers" [...] category. Astrid's death was given the title of [...] "Doctor Whos all-time greatest death scene", commenting it [...] "ticks boxes in all of our main categories [...] ", and [...] "her death would truly make a glass eye cry." [...] Tim Teeman of The Times gave the episode a negative review, stating that [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>boring,</b> despite the endless dashing about and CGI flimflam." [...] The Daily Mirror commented the episode had [...] "some brilliant psychedelic Pink Floyd-esque imagery", [...] "great baddies", and [...] "neat jokes", but lamented that [...] "the plot was a mess, consisting mostly of one hi-tech chase scene after another, and it descended into noise and bluster." ...|$|E

2500|$|In London, Burroughs {{had begun}} to write {{what would become the}} first novel of a trilogy, {{published}} as Cities of the Red Night (1981), The Place of Dead Roads (1983), and The Western Lands (1987). Grauerholz helped edit Cities when it was first rejected by Burroughs's long-time editor Dick Seaver at Holt Rinehart, after it was deemed too disjointed. The novel was written as a straight narrative and then chopped up into a more random pattern, leaving the reader to sort through the characters and events. This technique differed from the author's earlier cut-up methods, which were accidental from the start. Nevertheless, the novel was reassembled and published, still without a straight linear form, but with fewer breaks in the story. The trilogy featured time-travel adventures in which Burroughs's narrators rewrote episodes from history to reform mankind. Reviews were mixed for Cities. Novelist and critic Anthony Burgess panned the work in Saturday Review, saying Burroughs <b>was</b> <b>boring</b> readers with repetitive episodes of pederast fantasy and sexual strangulation that lacked any comprehensible world view or theology; other reviewers, like J. G. Ballard, argued that Burroughs was shaping a new literary [...] "mythography".|$|E
