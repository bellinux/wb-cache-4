This is accompanied by agitation in some cases. In this process the chlorophyll in the leaves is enzymatically broken down, and its tannins are released or transformed. This process is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "fermentation" [...] in the tea industry. The tea producer may choose when the oxidation should be stopped, which depends on the desired qualities in the final tea as well as the weather conditions (heat and humidity). For light oolong teas this may be anywhere from 5-40% oxidation, in darker oolong teas 60-70%, and in black teas 100% oxidation. Oxidation is highly important in the formation of many taste and aroma compounds, which give a tea its liquor colour, strength, and briskness. Depending on the type of tea desired, under or over-oxidation/fermentation can result in grassy flavours, or overly thick <b>winey</b> flavours.|$|E

60|$|I {{felt very}} dim, {{and only a}} bit of myself. And I dozed blankly. The {{afternoon}} grew more sunny. The ship turned southwards, and with the wind and waves behind, it became much warmer, much smoother. The sun had the lovely strong <b>winey</b> warmth, golden over the dark-blue sea. The old oak-wood looked almost white, the afternoon was sweet upon the sea. And in the sunshine and the swishing of the sea, the speedier running of the empty ship, I slept a warm, sweet hour away, and awoke new. To see ahead pale, uplooming islands upon the right: the windy Egades: and on the right a mountain or high conical hill, with buildings on the summit: and in front against the sea, still rather far away, buildings rising upon a quay, within a harbor: and a mole, and a castle forward to sea, all small and far away, like a view. The buildings were square and fine. There was something impressive--magical under the far sunshine and the keen wind, the square and well-proportioned buildings waiting far off, waiting like a lost city in a story, a Rip van Winkle city. I knew it was Trapani, the western port of Sicily, under the western sun.|$|E

40|$|Mid-infrared (MIR) spectra (4000 ¿ 600 cm - 1) {{of olive}} oils were {{analyzed}} using chemometric methods to identify the four main sensorial defects, musty, <b>winey,</b> fusty and rancid, previously evaluated by an expert sensory panel. Classification models were developed using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to distinguish between extra-virgin olive oils (defect absent) and lower quality olive oils (defect present). The most important spectral ranges responsible for the discrimination were identified. PLS-DA models were able to discriminate between defective and high quality oils with predictive abilities around 87 % for the musty defect and around 77 % for <b>winey,</b> fusty and rancid defects.

40|$|Three {{instrumental}} techniques, headspace-mass spectrometry (HS-MS), mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) and UV–visible spectrophotometry (UV–vis), {{have been}} combined to classify {{virgin olive oil}} samples based on {{the presence or absence}} of sensory defects. The reference sensory values were provided by an official taste panel. Different data fusion strategies were studied to improve the discrimination capability compared to using each instrumental technique individually. A general model was applied to discriminate high-quality non-defective olive oils (extra-virgin) and the lowest-quality olive oils considered non-edible (lampante). A specific identification of key off-flavours, such as musty, <b>winey,</b> fusty and rancid, was also studied. The data fusion of the three techniques improved the classification results in most of the cases. Low-level data fusion was the best strategy to discriminate musty, <b>winey</b> and fusty defects, using HS-MS, MIR and UV–vis, and the rancid defect using only HS-MS and MIR. The mid-level data fusion approach using partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) scores was found to be the best strategy for defective vs non-defective and edible vs non-edible oil discrimination. However, the data fusion did not sufficiently improve the results obtained by a single technique (HS-MS) to classify non-defective classes. These results indicate that instrumental data fusion can be useful for the identification of sensory defects in virgin olive oils...|$|E

40|$|Diblock {{copolymers}} {{blended with}} homopolymer may self-assemble into spherical, cylindrical or lamellar aggregates. Transitions between these structures may {{be driven by}} varying the homopolymer molecular weight or the molecular weight or composition of the diblock.

Our results are compared with X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy measurements by Kinning, <b>Winey</b> and Thomas and good agreement is found, although the tendency to form cylindrical and lamellar structures is sometimes overestimated due to our neglect of edge effects due to the finite size of these aggregates. Our results demonstrate that self-consistent field theory can {{provide detailed information on}} the self-assembly of isolated block copolymer aggregates.
