Large-billed antwren (Herpsilochmus longirostris), helmeted manakin (Antilophia galeata) and white-striped warbler (Myiothlypis leucophrys) {{are found in the}} forest {{formations}} of the unit. The collared crescentchest (Melanopareia torquata), rufous-sided pygmy tyrant (Euscarthmus rufomarginatus), curl-crested jay (Cyanocorax cristatellus), shrike-like tanager (Neothraupis fasciata), <b>white-rumped</b> <b>tanager</b> (Cypsnagra hirundinacea) and coal-crested finch (Charitospiza eucosma) are found in the closed cerrado.|$|E
50|$|The Baleia State Park holds diverse {{natural environments}} {{due to its}} rugged topography, and its varied rocks and soils.It holds alpine meadows, cerrado and a small area of gallery forest.The park {{provides}} a refuge for several endangered species of birds and animals.188 species of birds have been catalogued, of which 11 are endangered and three are endemic to the Baleia Forest.The three endemic birds species, considered endangered in other regions, are <b>white-rumped</b> <b>tanager</b> (Cypsnagra hirundinacea), blue finch (Porphyrospiza caerulescens) and swallow-tailed cotinga (Phibalura flavirostris).There are small mammals such as possums, armadillos, monkeys, coatis and ferrets.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>tanager</b> (Cypsnagra hirundinacea) is a tanager. It is {{the only}} member of the genus Cypsnagra. Length 16 cm. Weight 25-34 g. Live mostly in Brazil, also in Paraguay, Bolivia and Suriname. Elevation 700-1000 m. Inhabit grasslands with short trees. In Brazil exist in {{territorial}} groups of three to six individuals. Eat insects on the ground in the grass or catch them in flight (sallying). Mostly beetles, crickets and grasshoppers, occasionally eat fruit.Cup nests only 1-2 metres off the ground and made of woven grasses. Clutch size 3-4 blue eggs speckled around the large end with brown or black spots. Helpers born last season help mating pair tend the nest and nestlings.|$|E
5000|$|Insectivorous feeding flocks {{reach their}} fullest {{development}} in tropical forests, {{where they are}} a typical feature of bird life. In the Neotropics the leaders or [...] "core" [...] members may be black-throated shrike-tanagers in southern Mexico, or three-striped warblers elsewhere in Central America. In South America, core species may include antbirds such as Thamnomanes, antshrikes, Furnariidae (ovenbirds and woodcreepers) like the buff-fronted foliage-gleaner or the olivaceous woodcreeper, or Parulidae (New World [...] "warblers") like the golden-crowned warblers. In open cerrado habitat, it may be <b>white-rumped</b> or white-banded <b>tanagers.</b> Core species often have striking plumage and calls that attract other birds; they are often also known to be very active sentinels, providing warning of would-be predators.|$|R
40|$|The {{pressures}} for land use change {{have led to}} an increasing isolation of habitat remnants throughout the world. The goal {{of this study was}} to estimate the population size and density of some endemic and threatened species in a nature reserve in the Cerrado biome. One hundred and thirty four point transects were undertaken at the Estacao Ecologica de Itirapina (EEI), one of the last natural grassland savannah remnants in Sao Paulo state, in the south-east of Brazil between September and December 2006 and densities estimated for seven species (four endemic to the Cerrado, one near-endemic and two grassland specialists). Neither species reached the minimum viable population size of 500 - 5000 individuals. Four species, White-banded Tanager, <b>White-rumped</b> <b>Tanager,</b> Black-throated Saltator and Sharp-tailed Tyrant have populations ranging from 112 to 248 individuals, while the other species have a low population (< 60 individuals). The mean densities of Sharp-tailed Tyrant and Cock-tailed Tyrant in the EEI grassland showed similar values to those observed in larger areas of the Cerrado, which may indicate that the EEL grassland area is well conserved. In spite of the restricted size of the EEI, small areas can maintain some endemic and threatened bird populations, thus contributing to local biodiversity and the ecological processes in the region. The capacity of fragments of Cerrado (similar to 2, 000 ha) to maintain populations of endemic and threatened bird species is unlikely to be effective in the long term.
