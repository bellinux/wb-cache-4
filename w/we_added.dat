25|$|We felt keenly {{that while}} the miraculous events of the {{founding}} of the State of Israel had found fitting expression {in the other Conservative siddurim} the more difficult experience of the Holocaust had yet to find an appropriate place in our prayers, Therefore, we composed a Nahum prayer for Yom Ha-shoah, inspired by that which appeared in Siddur Va-ani Tefillati of the Masorti Movement in 1998. In an insert into the Amidah, similar to that used traditionally on Tisha B'Av, we seek God's comfort in light of our people's losses in Europe during the Holocaust. We felt the need, beyond that, to acknowledge on a daily basis the enormous effect that the Holocaust has had upon our people. At the end of Tahanun papers, in a prayer which reflects our suffering, <b>we</b> <b>added</b> reference to the anguish we still feel.|$|E

500|$|The Weighted Companion Cube {{inspiration}} {{was from}} project lead Kim Swift with additional input from Wolpaw from reading some [...] "declassified government interrogation thing" [...] whereby [...] "isolation leads subjects {{to begin to}} attach to inanimate objects"; Swift commented, [...] "We had a long level called Box Marathon; we wanted players to bring this box with them {{from the beginning to}} the end. But people would forget about the box, so <b>we</b> <b>added</b> dialogue, applied the heart to the cube, and continued to up the ante until people became attached to the box. Later on, <b>we</b> <b>added</b> the incineration idea. The artistic expression grew from the gameplay." [...] Wolpaw further noted that the need to incinerate the Weighted Companion Cube came {{as a result of the}} final boss battle design; they recognized they had not introduced the idea of incineration necessary to complete the boss battle, and by training the player to do it with the Weighted Companion Cube, found the narrative [...] "way stronger" [...] with its [...] "death". Swift noted that any similarities to psychological situations in the Milgram experiment or [...] are happenstance.|$|E

500|$|McKay {{stated that}} Rudd helped him rewrite the script, calling Rudd [...] "great with dialogue", adding [...] "the {{two of us}} holed up in hotel rooms on {{the east and west}} coast, and I think it was like six to eight weeks we just ground it out and did a giant rewrite of the script. I was really proud of what we did, I really thought we put some amazing stuff in there and built on an already strong script from Edgar Wright and sort of just {{enhanced}} some stuff." [...] Rudd elaborated, [...] "The idea, the trajectory, the goal, and the blueprint of it all, is really Edgar and Joe. It's their story. We changed some scenes, <b>we</b> <b>added</b> new sequences, we changed some characters, <b>we</b> <b>added</b> new characters. If you took the two scripts and held them up together they'd be very different—but the idea is all theirs." [...] Reed also offered contributions to the revised script, as did Lilly and Stoll, who contributed ideas to help flesh out their respective characters. Lilly's character received a fuller arc and more action sequences as a result. One of the important things when joining the film for Reed was emphasizing both Hope and Janet van Dyne more, given the Wasp being [...] "a crucial part" [...] of the Ant-Man comics. For their efforts, McKay and Rudd were credited as additional writers of the screenplay, with Wright and Cornish credited for the screenplay and story. Wright also held an executive producer credit on the film.|$|E

The facial structures are mainly based on the visuals of the GameCube version, and <b>we</b> <b>added</b> various details to these in order to develop a realistic structure." [...] For the sixth main game, Chris has been redesigned slightly; he now has a slightly disheveled look due to his alcoholism and post-traumatic amnesia. In 2016, IGN made a video focusing on his evolution throughout the series.|$|E

Hoppus was sick {{at the time of}} recording. Despite this, the band carried on and the demo was complete within two days. [...] "Buddha was cut live then <b>we</b> <b>added</b> the vocals. Two days and they were done – including the mix. It's quite standard for a young punk band to do that," [...] said engineer Jeff Forrest. Despite this, the liner notes for the cassette claim it was recorded in twelve hours, while the later remaster of Buddha contend it was recorded [...] "over three rainy nights."

500|$|Aspinall later commented {{about his}} first meeting with George Harrison, who also {{attended}} the Liverpool Institute: [...] "My first encounter with George was behind the school’s air-raid shelters. [...] This great mass of shaggy hair loomed up and an out-of-breath voice requested a quick drag of my Woodbine. It {{was one of the first}} cigarettes either of us had smoked. We spluttered our way through it bravely but gleefully. After that the three of us did lots of ridiculous things together.... By the time we were ready to take the GCE exams <b>we</b> <b>added</b> John Lennon to our 'Mad Lad' gang. He was doing his first term at Liverpool College of Art which overlooks the Liverpool Institute playground and we all got together in a students coffee bar at lunchtime." [...] Aspinall took nine GCEs at the Institute and passed eight of them, but failed the French exam. He left school in July 1959, and studied accountancy. [...] Aspinall worked for a Liverpool company for two years, receiving a wage of £2-10s–0d. (£2.50 decimal equivalent) per week as a trainee accountant.|$|E
500|$|The {{writing and}} {{formation}} of By the Way began {{immediately following the}} culmination of Californication's world tour, {{in the spring of}} 2001. As with Californication, much of the creation took place in the band members' homes and other practice locations, such as a recording studio stage. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "We started finding some magic and some music and some riffs and some rhythms and some jams and some grooves, and <b>we</b> <b>added</b> to it and subtracted from it and pushed it around and put melodies to it." [...] Frusciante and Kiedis would collaborate for days straight, discussing guitar progressions and sharing lyrics. For Kiedis, [...] "writing By the Way...was a whole different experience from Californication. John was back to himself and brimming with confidence." [...] Prior to recording By the Way, the Chili Peppers decided that they would again have Rick Rubin produce the album. Rubin had, in the past, granted the Chili Peppers creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought essential for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return.|$|E
500|$|Rare {{decided to}} make an action-based game that focused totally on Banjo and his abilities. Kazooie was later {{conceived}} during the planning of such abilities. According to Mayles, [...] "We {{came up with the}} [...] idea that a pair of wings could appear from his backpack to help him perform a second jump. We also wanted Banjo to be able to run very fast when required [...] <b>we</b> <b>added</b> a pair of 'fast-running' legs that appeared {{from the bottom of the}} backpack. [...] we came up with the logical conclusion that these could belong to another character, one that actually lived in Banjo's backpack." [...] The character was named after a kazoo, which was considered an annoying instrument, [...] "much like the personality of the bird", Mayles explained. Instead of actual dialogue, all the characters in the game feature [...] "mumbling" [...] voices. This choice was made to convey their personalities without them actually speaking, as Rare felt the actual speech [...] "could ruin the player's perception of the characters." [...] The witch Gruntilda was inspired by Grotbags from the Grotbags British television series.|$|E

500|$|Character shading {{supervisor}} on {{the film}} Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges {{on the film}}, saying: [...] "Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film. We started out by learning {{as much as we}} could. At the local body shop, we watched them paint a car, and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that we needed a base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality the might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone." [...] Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: [...] "Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we’ve seen in any of our previous films. In the past, we’ve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for Cars <b>we</b> <b>added</b> a ray-tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was shot on April 10 and April 11, 2010 at Sony Studios in Culver City, California. Over twenty female and twenty male backup dancers were used. The video casts Cyrus as an exotic {{songbird}} {{breaking out of}} its cage, symbolizing Cyrus as a singer breaking out of her good-girl image. Prior to the shoot, Cyrus meticulously recorded her ideas for the video on paper. For example, she chose her back-up dancers make-up pallets and contemplated their outfits; while {{she did not want}} her dancer's bodies [...] "to look like normal bodies", she also did not want for them to wear scales as, according to her, it would make them resemble to be fish and look scary. Hales wanted Cyrus to resemble a bird without [...] "actually having a beak" [...] or otherwise being overly explicit, so Cyrus' stylists invented bird-like accessories. Among these were arm bands with long leather straps, feathered shoulder pads, and a feathered vest worn over a black leotard and thigh-high black leather boots. Cyrus said she had originally worn a [...] "completely different" [...] outfit, but wasn't [...] "feeling it" [...] the morning of the shoot. [...] "So we made this one right there in the morning, and <b>we</b> <b>added</b> pieces throughout the day... more leather and more feathers. I think it's really fun and kept changing the look," [...] she said. Cyrus' make-up artist, Denika Bedrossian, focused on the singer's eyes; he used [...] "rich jewel-toned shades" [...] and eyelashes with feathered tips to give Cyrus a [...] "deep peacock eye". In cut-scenes, Cyrus wears a corset made of 2,400 silver metal pieces and numerous peacock feathers. It was designed by The Blonds, debuted during their fall 2010 fashion show, and cost $25,000.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{scheduled}} for North American release on November 1, 1998, Bungie {{were unable to}} have the game ready in time.

[...] The team then set a release date for just prior to Christmas, meaning the game would need to go gold by {{the first week of}} December.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Bungle emerged {{after its}} members were kicked out their {{respective}} bands. [...] "It was kinda like a merger between two bands," [...] Mike Patton recalled. [...] "One really horrible gothic metal band, which our guitarist and original drummer were in, and one really horrible metal band which did Metallica covers, {{which is the}} one Trevor and me came from." [...] Mr. Bungle initially described themselves as a death metal band, but also dabbled in speed metal, thrash metal, and hardcore punk.

Trevor Dunn noted that, [...] "After about a year we got tired of playing speed metal and wanted to do something a little more creative. So we just stopped and started writing our own style of music, which was influenced by bands like Camper Van Beethoven, Oingo Boingo, Bad Manners and kind of ska funk-ish oriented stuff. Then <b>we</b> <b>added</b> a two-piece horn section and a new drummer, so now we don't really have any kind of limit on the music we play." [...] Trey Spruance corroborated this. “When I was 15, I was in a death metal group," [...] Spruance reminisced. [...] "We had this idea {{that we were going to}} play a bunch of ska tunes for a bunch of metalheads.
