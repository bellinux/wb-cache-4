[...] The late Admiral Lent had been the earlier Tritons first commanding officer. [...] A watercolor painting of the ship also was presented by the American <b>Water</b> <b>Color</b> Society.

Lockwood in 1822. Because printing of game boards {{was more difficult}} in 1822 than 1843, the term mass market is a gray area. In 1822 reversed etched copper plates were used to print game boards. After the first 2,000 impressions, breaks quickly appeared in lines. Games were so expensive, the people who could afford them did not want game boards they could not read. By 1843, lithography with <b>water</b> <b>color</b> painting was popular. Lithography could easily produce 40,000 perfect impressions.|$|E

2500|$|Hills came {{to prefer}} {{watercolor}} and pastel to oils {{even though these}} media were at the time considered suitable only for preliminary work and were not often exhibited. [...] This situation began to change early in Hills' career, spurred {{in part by the}} founding of national and local watercolor and pastel societies in the late 1800s. Hills had her first solo exhibition in 1889 at the J. Eastman Chase Gallery in Boston, showing a group of pastel landscapes and still lifes. [...] The following year, she showed work at the Boston <b>Water</b> <b>Color</b> Club's Fourth Annual Exhibition, which was also held at the Chase Gallery. She exhibited watercolors and pastels throughout her career, and focused on pastels in her later years as her eyesight began to fail.|$|E
2500|$|Hassam became {{close friends}} with fellow American Impressionist artists J. Alden Weir and John Henry Twachtman, {{whom he met}} through the American <b>Water</b> <b>Color</b> Society, and over the {{following}} months he made many connections in the art community through other art societies and social clubs. He contributed works from his European stay to several exhibitions and shows. Hassam enthusiastically painted the genteel urban atmosphere of New York that he encountered {{within walking distance of}} his apartment, and avoided the squalor of the lower-class neighborhoods. He proclaimed that [...] "New York is the most beautiful city in the world. There is no boulevard in all Paris that compares to our own Fifth Avenue...the average American still fails to appreciate the beauty of his own country." [...] He captured well-dressed men in bowler hats and top hats, fashionable women and children out and about, and horse-drawn cabs slowly making their way along crowded thoroughfares lined by commercial buildings (which were generally less than six stories high at that time). Hassam's primary focus would forever continue to be [...] "humanity in motion". He never doubted his own artistic development and his subjects, remaining confident in his instinctual choices throughout his life.|$|E

60|$|Little {{is to be}} said of {{the skies}} of our other {{landscape}} artists. In paintings, they are commonly toneless, crude, and wanting in depth and transparency; but in drawings, some very perfect and delicate examples have been produced by various members of the old <b>water</b> <b>color</b> Society, and one or two others; but with respect to the qualities of which we are at present speaking, it is not right to compare drawings with paintings, as the wash or spunging, or other artifices peculiar to <b>water</b> <b>color,</b> are capable of producing an appearance of quality which it needs much higher art to produce in oils.|$|E

6000|$|... 86. One {{of those}} which I suppose great workmen would always admit, is, that, {{whatever}} material we use, {{the virtues of}} that material are to be exhibited, and its defects frankly admitted; no effort being made to conquer those defects by such skill as may make the material resemble another. For instance, in the dispute so frequently revived by the public, touching {{the relative merits of}} oil color and water color; I do not think a great painter would ever consider it a merit in a <b>water</b> <b>color</b> to have the [...] "force of oil." [...] He would like it to have the peculiar delicacy, paleness, and transparency belonging specially to its own material. On the other hand, I think he would not like an oil painting to have the deadness or paleness of a <b>water</b> <b>color.</b> He would like it to have the deep shadows, and the rich glow, and crumbling and bossy touches which are alone attainable in oil color. And if he painted in fresco, he would neither aim at the transparency of <b>water</b> <b>color,</b> nor the richness of oil; but at luminous bloom of surface, and dignity of clearly visible form. I do not think that this principle would be disputed by artists of great power at any time, or in any country; though, if by mischance they had been compelled to work in one material, while desiring the qualities only attainable in another, they might strive, and meritoriously strive, for those better results, with what they had under their hand. The change of manner in William Hunt's work, in the later part of his life, was an example of this. As his art became more developed, he perceived in his subjects qualities which it was impossible to express in a transparent medium; and employed opaque white to draw with, when the finer forms of relieved light could not be otherwise followed. It was out of his power to do more than this, since in later life any attempt to learn the manipulation of oil color would have been unadvisable; and he obtained results of singular beauty; though their preciousness and completion would never, in a well-founded school of Art, have been trusted to the frail substance of <b>water</b> <b>color.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... 67. The use {{of leaving}} the edges always sharp is {{that you may not}} trouble or vex the color, but let it lie as it falls {{suddenly}} on the paper: color looks much more lovely when it has been laid on with a dash of the brush, and left to dry in its own way, than when it has been dragged about and disturbed; so that it is always better to let the edges and forms be a little wrong, even if one cannot correct them afterwards, than to lose this fresh quality of the tint. Very great masters in <b>water</b> <b>color</b> can lay on the true forms at once with a dash, and bad masters in <b>water</b> <b>color</b> lay on grossly false forms with a dash, and leave them false; for people in general, not knowing false from true, are as much pleased with the appearance of power in the irregular blot as with the presence of power in the determined one; but we, in our beginnings, must do {{as much as we can}} with the broad dash, and then correct with the point, till we are quite right.

The drawing-board is set so that the draughtsman's chair has the window on its left hand. On the floor {{at the end of}} the table, on its right, is a ship's fire bucket. On the port side of the room, near the bookshelves, is a sofa with its back to the windows. It is a sturdy mahogany article, oddly upholstered in sailcloth, including the bolster, with a couple of blankets hanging over the back. Between the sofa and the drawing-table is a big wicker chair, with broad arms and a low sloping back, with its back to the light. A small but stout table of teak, with a round top and gate legs, stands against the port wall between the door and the bookcase. It is the only article in the room that suggests (not at all convincingly) a woman's hand in the furnishing. The uncarpeted floor of narrow boards is caulked and holystoned like a deck.|$|E
6000|$|Yet in {{the poorest}} corner of this soul-destroying Christendom {{vitality}} suddenly begins to germinate again. Joyousness, a sacred gift long dethroned by the hellish laughter of derision and obscenity, rises like a flood miraculously out of the fetid dust and mud of the slums; rousing marches and impetuous dithyrambs rise to the heavens from people among whom the depressing noise called [...] "sacred music" [...] is a standing joke; a flag with Blood and Fire on it is unfurled, not in murderous rancor, but because fire is beautiful and blood a vital and splendid red; Fear, which we flatter by calling Self, vanishes; and transfigured men and women carry their gospel through a transfigured world, calling their leader General, themselves captains and brigadiers, and their whole body an Army: praying, but praying only for refreshment, for strength to fight, and for needful MONEY (a notable sign, that); preaching, but not preaching submission; daring ill-usage and abuse, but not putting up with more of it than is inevitable; and practising what the world will let them practise, including soap and <b>water,</b> <b>color</b> and music.

It {{is hardly}} {{necessary}} {{to point out}} the earnestness or humility in the works of William Hunt; but it may be so to suggest the high value they possess as records of English rural life, and still life. Who is there who for a moment could contend with him in the unaffected, yet humorous truth with which he has painted our peasant children? Who is there who does not sympathize with him in the simple love with which he dwells on the brightness and bloom of our summer fruit and flowers? And yet {{there is something to be}} regretted concerning him: why should he be allowed continually to paint the same bunches of hot-house grapes, and supply to the <b>Water</b> <b>Color</b> Society a succession of pine-apples with the regularity of a Covent Garden fruiterer? He has of late discovered that primrose banks are lovely, but there are other things grow wild besides primroses: what undreamt-of loveliness might he not bring back to us, if he would lose himself for a summer in Highland foregrounds; if he would paint the heather as it grows, and the foxglove and the harebell as they nestle in the clefts of the rocks, and the mosses and bright lichens of the rocks themselves. And then, cross to the Jura, and bring back a piece of Jura pasture in spring; with the gentians in their earliest blue, and a soldanelle beside the fading snow! And return again, and paint a gray wall of alpine crag, with budding roses crowning it like a wreath of rubies. That is what he was meant to do in this world; not to paint bouquets in china vases.|$|E
