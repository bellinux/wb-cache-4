5|$|Blood <b>was</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potent {{source of}} {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and {{the sacrifice of}} a living creature was a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, {{and the most important}} Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E

5|$|Four {{years after}} the events of Brood War, the shapeshifter reemerged in the Korpulu Sector, now going by the persona Dr. Emil Narud – an enigmatic {{scientist}} first introduced in Wings of Liberty and later appearing in Heart of the Swarm, voiced by Armin Shimerman.

5|$|From May 1684, the King's illegitimate son, James Scott, Duke of Monmouth, {{lived in}} the Netherlands, where he was fêted by William and Mary. Monmouth <b>was</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rival to the Duke of York, and as a {{potential}} Protestant heir who could supplant James {{in the line of}} succession. William, however, did not consider him a viable alternative and correctly assumed that Monmouth had insufficient support.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{and private}} {{enterprises}} have also come {{under pressure from}} China to censor media organizations operated by Falun Gong practitioners. In 2008, for instance, French satellite provider Eutelsat suspended its Asian broadcasts of New Tang Dynasty Television in response to pressure from China's State Administration of Radio, Film and Television.

5|$|On 6 January 1929, King Alexander {{dissolved}} {{the government}} and introduced a royal dictatorship over the newly created Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Because he <b>was</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dissident, Lorković was placed under constant police surveillance. On 15 November 1929, a warrant for his arrest was issued, but he succeeded in escaping to Austria and later to Germany.|$|E
5|$|On January 25, 1776, Congress {{approved}} {{the establishment of}} a monument in memory of Montgomery. A state memorial service was also scheduled and carried out on February 19, 1776. Throughout the colonies, Montgomery <b>was</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hero, and Patriots tried to use his death to promote their cause in the war. Montgomery's name was used very often in literature; among the authors who used his name was Thomas Paine.|$|E

With over eight million copies sold in 2004, the album <b>was</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sign of {{recovering}} album sales in the US, following three years of decline. It was also exemplary of urban music's commercial peak and dominance of the Billboard charts in 2004. Confessions has been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and, as of 2016, has sold over 10.3 million copies in the US and over 20 million copies worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the second}} leg, Ridsdale took out {{advertisements}} in British newspapers calling for calm, with the messages in the adverts also being translated into Turkish. Despite this, West Yorkshire Police warned local Turkish businesses to close early. When Galatasaray officials arrived at Elland Road {{for the second}} leg, hundreds of Leeds fans attacked the coach busses that were carrying them which delayed the kick-off of the second leg.

5|$|For the North Vietnamese, the Route 9 – Southern Laos Victory, <b>was</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{complete}} success. The military {{expansion of}} the Ho Chi Minh Trail to the west which had begun in 1970 {{at the expense of}} Laotian forces, was quickly accelerated. Laotian troops were soon withdrawing toward the Mekong River and a logistical artery 60 miles in width was soon expanded to 90 miles. Another result of the operation was a firm decision by the Politburo to launch a major conventional invasion of South Vietnam in early 1972, paving the way for the Nguyễn Huệ Offensive, known in the west as the Easter Offensive.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{possessed a}} gift for the English language, and his {{writings}} are admired as legal literature. He rose to fame outside the legal profession in 1944 during World War II after giving a short address in Central Park that struck a popular chord in its appeal for tolerance. During a period when a hysterical fear of subversion divided the nation, Hand <b>was</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> liberal defender of civil liberties. A collection of Hand's papers and addresses, published in 1952 as The Spirit of Liberty, sold well and won him new admirers. Even after he criticized the civil-rights activism of the 1950s Warren Court, Hand retained his popularity.|$|E

5|$|In January 1957, the US {{adopted the}} Eisenhower Doctrine and pledged {{to prevent the}} spread of {{communism}} and its perceived agents in the Middle East. Although Nasser was an opponent of communism in the region, his promotion of pan-Arabism <b>was</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> threat by pro-Western states in the region. Eisenhower tried to isolate Nasser and reduce his regional influence by attempting to transform King Saud into a counterweight. Also in January, the elected Jordanian prime minister and Nasser supporter Sulayman al-Nabulsi brought Jordan into a military pact with Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century Æthelwulf's {{reputation}} among historians was poor: he {{was seen}} as excessively pious and impractical, and his pilgrimage <b>was</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> desertion of his duties. Historians {{in the 21st century}} see him very differently, as a king who consolidated and extended the power of his dynasty, commanded respect on the continent, and dealt more effectively than most of his contemporaries with Viking attacks. He is {{regarded as one of the}} most successful West Saxon kings, who laid the foundations for the success of his son, Alfred the Great.|$|E

The record <b>was</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{commercial}} disappointment in the country, given that Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008) debuted at {{number one on the}} chart with first-week sales of 371,000 copies. As of January 2014, the album has moved 350,000 units in the United States. Can't Be Tamed reached number two on the Canadian Albums Chart, and peaked at number ten on the Top 100 Mexico.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years in western Virginia, pioneer {{settlers}} were primarily concerned with providing defense from Native American attacks, so little emphasis was placed upon education. Education <b>was</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> religious duty, {{to be provided for}} at home, where its quality was dependent upon the spare time and level of education of parents. With the growth of settlement in Pearsall's Flats, and later Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans for the establishment of schools and churches.|$|E
5|$|Many {{cultures}} {{throughout history}} have viewed obesity {{as the result}} of a character flaw. The obesus or fat character in Ancient Greek comedy was a glutton and figure of mockery.

In modern Western culture, excess weight is often regarded as unattractive, and obesity is commonly associated with various negative stereotypes. People of all ages can face social stigmatization, and may be targeted by bullies or shunned by their peers.|$|E
