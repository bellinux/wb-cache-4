Local businessmen established an electric utility in 1909. A bottling facility for soda was operated in Tinley Park until the 1950s. Inventor John Rauhoff developed and manufactured a <b>waterproofing</b> <b>additive</b> for cement called Ironite, later {{used in the}} construction of Hoover Dam. In {{the latter part of the}} 20th century, Tinley Park was, and remains to be, an area of rapid suburban expansion to the west and south of the original site, with over 11,000 housing units constructed between 1970 and 1994.|$|E
30|$|The {{pretreatment}} {{methods of}} wood dowels were analyzed. Wood dowels soaked in ethylene glycol for 10  min could improve the pullout resistance by 98.05 % [5]. Similar conclusion {{was obtained from}} Chedeville [4]. The interactions rotation rate/ethylene glycol were the second most significant in wood dowel welding. While the treatment with sunflower oil and water reduced the pullout resistance [5]. Amirous also found that citric acid was used as <b>waterproofing</b> <b>additive</b> in butt joints linear wood welding [9]. And in our previous study, wood dowel with diameter of 12  mm pretreated in 0.1  mol/L CuCl 2 acid solution with immersion time of 1, 3, 5, and 7 days were studied. So {{it was necessary to}} analyze the influence of shorter immersion time on wood dowel with the diameter of 10  mm and the pullout resistance. Meanwhile, the influence of pretreatment on temperature of welding interface should be studied.|$|E
30|$|Citric acid {{was used}} as <b>waterproofing</b> <b>additive</b> in butt joints linear wood welding [36]. In the {{preliminary}} study of wood dowel welding, wood dowels pretreated with acid solution were considered. Several preliminary tests with dowels immersed in different acid solution including CuCl 2, FeCl 3, HCl solution, and chemical copper plating were carried out. The effect of immersion time of 1, 3, 5, and 7  days was tested. According to the test results, dowels immersed in CuCl 2 solution for 7 days showed the best pullout resistance. CuCl 2 solution is slightly acidic because of the hydrolysis of Cu 2 +. The softened surface of the wood dowels caused by the acid corrosion promoted the formation of molten materials. This study aimed to analyze the influence of wood dowels immersed in CuCl 2 solution for 7 days on welding performance. The chemical changes were detected using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Thermogravimetric (TG) analyses. These results revealed significant changes of functional groups and wood components [33, 37, 38].|$|E

Several studies have been undertaken to produce <b>waterproofing</b> <b>additives</b> that extend the service life of concrete elements. Consequently, {{a great deal of}} repair and maintenance costs could be avoided. This paper aims to review the studies which have used various agents and tests to evaluate the waterproofing efficiency of concrete. The study establishes the taxonomy and construct of research in concrete waterproofing research. Study established frequency aggregation of different additive used and tests applied. The technique adopted by majority of the researchers was the use of surface coating. Water absorption was found to be the most common test in this research area. Study delineated that most researchers focused on the use of polymer-based materials, silicates containing compound, silanes, siloxanes, cementing materials and some nano materials. Finally, study established three classification of additives based on material structure, method of application and additives functions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDisposal of {{industrial}} waste {{is an important}} factor influencing the safety of human life, on sustainable development of the regions and the efficiency of many industries, including construction, housing and communal services. One of the main ways of recycling {{of industrial}} waste, given the hierarchical order is the production of building materials, including environmentally friendly aerated concrete products with the given (normalized) building-technical properties. The disadvantages of aerated concrete include high rates of absorption, of moisture absorption, low resistance to frost. The proposed method improve the hydrophysical properties of aerated concrete by the joint application of <b>waterproofing</b> <b>additives</b> and hydrophobic traeger in the form of pellets made from bitumen and fly ash. Modified concrete has reduced by 30 % {{of the value of the}} residual moisture, water absorption 38 [...] . 39 % and capillary leak – 30 [...] . 32 %. Modified aerated concrete differs from a traditional to a more uniform fine-pored structure. The results of experimental-industrial tests showed that the proposed technical solutions allow to significantly improve the building-technical properties of aerated concrete, providing it with the competitiveness on the market of construction materials...|$|R

One of the main properties of the resulting board was its resistance to water, due to the hydrophobic properties of the common reed, despite there being no incorporation of melamine or any other <b>waterproofing</b> <b>additive.</b> The boards that were developed were analyzed using 2 mm and 4 mm sieves for fibre selection, a manufacturing pressure of 3 N/mm 2 and 25 N/mm 2, and a volume of urea formaldehyde resin content ranging from 5. 2 % to 13 % (8 to 20 % liquid format). Standard destructive tests were performed. It was found that under certain applied conditions, namely high pressure and adequate resin proportion (a pressure of over 3 N/mm 2 and over 15 % liquid resin), Arundo donax L. particleboard demonstrated full recovery from the swelling test. This finding highlights an unmatched property in terms of recovery from the swelling test of the designed board. This property confers a interesting property {{to be used in}} high humidity environments without the need for special resin or waterproofing process...|$|E

40|$|AbstractNowadays, the {{concrete}} admixtures {{are widely used}} in the construction projects. The main types of chemical admixtures can be summarized as plasticizers, accelerating/retarding agents, air entraining agents, <b>waterproofing</b> <b>additives</b> and others such as corrosion inhibitors and colouring agents etc. The benefits derived {{from the use of}} chemical admixtures include improved durability, strength, chemical resistance, colouring, reduction in water and cement requirement and enhanced working properties of concrete. Turkey {{is one of the major}} consumers in developing countries regarding chemical admixtures. Therefore, this study set out to determine general utilization and consciousness about admixtures through a survey in Eskisehir, Turkey. The survey was performed by 153 construction professionals. The questions about reasons for preference of admixtures, types of preferred admixtures and dosage, beneficial and adverse effects of admixtures, impacts on cost and judicious use of admixtures are included in the survey. A number of statistical analyses are carried out using SPSS on data obtained. According to results, chemical admixtures are used over 70 % of the total annual concrete production. The initial expectation of the participants in the use of the admixtures is to improve the properties of the fresh concrete. Additionally, the most preferred admixtures are plasticizers. The ensuing types of admixtures are agents affecting the setting time of concrete. Although the participants’ interest to using chemical admixtures is very remarkable, the awareness on this subject is very deficient. The similar studies can be suggested to apply more comprehensively. Professionals, at any level in the construction sector, need to be informed about the accurate consumption of these agents in order to avoid inappropriate results...|$|R
