5|$|At Elizabeth's first {{interrogation}} session, the Japanese {{told her}} that some ships had been sunk in the harbour and they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> location of {{a large amount of}} money. She claimed no knowledge of the matter but was repeatedly interrogated and beaten. At various times, the Kempeitai forced Elizabeth to kneel on some angled bars of wood on the floor. They stripped her topless and tied her to the wood so she could not go either forwards or backwards. Then they applied electric shocks to her. They even brought in her husband to let him see her being tortured. After nine months in captivity, Elizabeth had lost half her body weight.|$|E
5|$|Having {{decided on}} a {{location}} and date, there still remained the matter {{of what would be}} tested. John Challens, whose weapons electronics group at Aldermaston had to produce the bomb assembly, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> configuration of Green Granite. Cook ruled that it would use a Red Beard Tom, and would fit inside a Blue Danube casing for air dropping. The design was frozen in April 1956. There were two versions of Orange Herald, large and small. They had similar cores, but the large version contained more explosive. Both designs were frozen in July. The Green Bamboo design was also nominally frozen, but tinkering with it continued. On 3 September, John Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite.|$|E

On 3 September, Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite. By January 1957, with the tests just months away, a tentative schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was too large to fit into a missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could fit into a Yellow Sun casing that could be used by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another ₤1.5 million.|$|E

25|$|The growing fame of Cayce {{along with}} the {{popularity}} he received from newspapers attracted several eager commercially minded men who wanted to seek a fortune by using his clairvoyant abilities. Even though Cayce was reluctant to help them, he was persuaded to give his readings, which left him dissatisfied with himself and unsuccessful. A cotton merchant offered him a hundred dollars a day for his readings about the daily outcomes in the cotton market; however, despite his poor finances, Cayce refused the merchant's offer. Some {{wanted to know where}} to hunt for treasures while others <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> outcome of horse races. Several times he was persuaded to give such readings as an experiment. However, when he used his ability for such purposes, he did no better than chance alone would dictate. These experiments allegedly left him depleted of energy, distraught, and unsatisfied with himself. Finally, he decided to use his gift only to help the distressed and sick.|$|E
25|$|Curtiss quickly {{recognized}} Genie's nonverbal communication abilities, recalling several nonverbal interactions Genie {{had with}} strangers during that time. By this time Genie could name {{most of the}} things around her and had an estimated vocabulary of at least a few hundred words, consisting of a few verbs and adjectives and a large number of nouns. She was also extremely eager to expand her vocabulary, frequently grabbing Curtiss' hand and pointing it towards objects for which she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> word, and if Curtiss could not figure out exactly what Genie was looking for Genie refused to let go until she learned at least one new word. Curtiss noted Genie's focus on objective properties, and especially her knowledge of color words, was very unusual because these require a level of cognitive sophistication not present in young children, suggesting she developed mental mechanisms for categorization during childhood. She had also clearly learned some basic principles of grammar, and understood more than she was producing.|$|E

The March 28 issue of the Telegraph and Texas Register only gave the burial location as where [...] "the principal heap of ashes" [...] had been found. In the following decades, the public <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> location of the burial site, but Seguín gave conflicting statements, perceived as due to age-related memory problems. Remains thought to be those of the Alamo defenders were discovered at the Cathedral of San Fernando during the Texas 1936 centennial, and re-interred in a marble sarcophagus. Purported to hold the ashes of Travis, Bowie and Crockett, some have doubted it can be proven whose remains are entombed there.|$|E

[...] While bemoaning the state of Harrison's voice and the [...] "sonic patchwork" [...] nature of the set, Leng notes that both [...] "So Sad" [...] and [...] "Far East Man" [...] were received positively when first released on albums by Alvin Lee & Mylon LeFevre and Ron Wood, respectively. The difference in winter 1974–75, Leng continues, was that, by championing Ravi Shankar's Indian music segments during the tour and neglecting his duties as an ex-Beatle in America, Harrison had [...] "committed the cardinal counterculture sin – he had rejected 'rock 'n' roll'".|$|E
500|$|French {{ambassador}} Stanislas Ostroróg {{was involved}} in returning {{the remains of the}} Irish poet from France to Ireland in 1948; {{in a letter to the}} European director of the Foreign Ministry in Paris [...] "Ostrorog tells how Yeats’s son Michael sought official help in locating the poet’s remains. [...] Neither Michael Yeats nor Sean MacBride, the Irish foreign minister who organised the ceremony, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> details of how the remains were collected, Ostrorog notes. [...] He repeatedly urges caution and discretion and says the Irish ambassador in Paris should not be informed." [...] Yeats' body was exhumed in 1946 and the remains were moved to on ossuary and mixed with other remains. The French Foreign Ministry authorized Ostrorog to secretly cover the cost of repatriation from his slush fund. Authorities were worried about the fact that the much-loved poet's remains were thrown into a communal grave, causing embarrassment for both Ireland and France. [...] "Mr Rebouillat, (a) forensic doctor in Roquebrune would be able to reconstitute a skeleton presenting all the characteristics of the deceased." [...] per a letter from Ostroróg to his superiors.|$|E

The Bureau was a joint {{initiative}} of the Admiralty and the War Office to control secret intelligence operations in the UK and overseas, particularly concentrating on the activities of the Imperial German government. [...] The bureau was split into naval and army sections which, over time, specialised in foreign espionage and internal counter-espionage activities, respectively. This specialisation was because the Admiralty <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> maritime strength of the Imperial German Navy. This specialisation was formalised before 1914. During the First World War in 1916, the two sections underwent administrative changes so that the foreign section became the section MI1(c) of the Directorate of Military Intelligence.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the success}} of For a Few Dollars More, {{executives}} at United Artists approached the film's screenwriter, Luciano Vincenzoni, to sign a contract {{for the rights to}} the film and for the next one. He, producer Alberto Grimaldi and Sergio Leone had no plans, but with their blessing, Vincenzoni pitched an idea about [...] "a film about three rogues who are looking for some treasure {{at the time of the}} American Civil War". The studio agreed, but <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> cost for this next film. At the same time, Grimaldi was trying to broker his own deal, but Vincenzoni's idea was more lucrative. The two men struck an agreement with UA for a million-dollar budget, with the studio advancing $500,000 up front and 50% of the box office takings outside of Italy. The total budget would eventually be $1.2 million.|$|E

The testing began with the Operation Crossroads series in July 1946. Shortly after World War II ended, President Harry S. Truman directed Army and Navy officials to secure a site for testing nuclear weapons on American warships. While the Army had seen the results of a land-based explosion, the Navy <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> effect of a nuclear weapon on ships.
