5|$|UNTAG {{was a large}} operation, {{with nearly}} 8,000 men and women {{deployed}} to Namibia from more than 120 countries to assist the process. The military force numbered approximately 4,500, and was commanded by Lieutenant-General Dewan Prem Chand of India; the main military UNTAG Headquarters was in <b>Windhoek,</b> Namibia's capital and largest city. The commanders of the Australian contingents were Colonels Richard D. Warren (1ASC) and John A. Crocker (2ASC). Other senior appointments included the contingent seconds-in-command, Lieutenant colonels Kevin Pippard (1ASC) and Ken Gillespie (2ASC), and the officers commanding the 17th Construction Squadron, Majors David Crago (1ASC) and Brendan Sowry (2ASC).|$|E
5|$|Research in the {{archives}} of pre-1914 horse breeding operations found at <b>Windhoek,</b> combined with blood typing studies, suggests that the animals descended from a gene pool of high-quality riding animals, as opposed to work horses. A study released in 2005 reinforces {{the theory of the}} Namib Desert Horse descending from a combination of European-descended breeding stock and escaped military horses. One possible source of breeding stock was a stud farm near Kubub, leased by Emil Kreplin (previously mayor of Lüderitz) from 1911 to 1919. Photo albums from the stud show animals with conformation and markings similar to those seen in the modern Namib Desert Horse. In addition, in early 1915, during the fighting of World War I, bombs were dropped by a German aircraft onto the South African camp near Garub. Some ordnance seems to have been specifically targeted to land among a herd of 1,700 grazing horses, for the purposes of scattering them. These escaped army animals may have joined stock animals lost from Kreplin's stud farm during the turmoil of the war. Horses in the area would likely have congregated at the few existing watering places in the Aus Mountains and Garub.|$|E

25|$|Due to Windhoek's {{proximity}} to Hosea Kutako International Airport, <b>Windhoek</b> serves {{an important role}} in Namibia's tourism. The report on Namibia Tourism Exit Survey 2012 - 2013, produced by the Millennium Challenge Corporation for the Namibian Directorate of Tourism, indicates that 56% of all tourists visiting Namibia during that time period, visited <b>Windhoek.</b> In addition hereto, many of Namibia's tourism related parastatals and governing bodies such as Namibia Wildlife Resorts, Air Namibia and the Namibia Tourism Board as well as Namibia's tourism related associations such as the Hospitality Association of Namibia are headquartered in <b>Windhoek.</b> <b>Windhoek</b> is also home to a number of notable hotels such as <b>Windhoek</b> Country Club Resort and some international hotel chains such as Avani Hotels and Resorts and Hilton Hotels and Resorts, that also operate in <b>Windhoek.</b>|$|E

25|$|Theories vary on how {{the place}} got its modern name of <b>Windhoek.</b> Most believe it {{is derived from the}} Afrikaans word wind-hoek (wind corner). Another theory {{suggests}} that Captain Jonker Afrikaner named <b>Windhoek</b> after the Winterhoek Mountains at Tulbagh in South Africa, where his ancestors had lived. The first known mention of the name <b>Windhoek</b> was in a letter from Jonker Afrikaner to Joseph Tindall, dated 12 August 1844.|$|E

25|$|The city is the administrative, commercial, and {{industrial}} center of Namibia. A 1992/93 study estimated that <b>Windhoek</b> provides {{over half of}} Namibia's non-agricultural employment, with its national share of employment in utilities being 96%, in transport and communication 94%, finance and business services 82%. Due to its relative size <b>Windhoek</b> is, even more than many other national capital cities, the social, economic, and cultural centre of the country. Nearly every national enterprise is headquartered here. The University of Namibia is, too, as are the country's only theatre, all ministry head offices, and all major media and financial entities. The governmental budget {{of the city of}} <b>Windhoek</b> nearly equals those of all other Namibian local authorities combined. Of the 3,300 US$-millionaires in Namibia, 1,400 live in <b>Windhoek.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1840 Jonker Afrikaner {{established}} an Orlam settlement at <b>Windhoek.</b> He {{and his followers}} stayed {{near one of the}} main hot springs, located in the present-day Klein <b>Windhoek</b> suburb. He built a stone church that held 500 people; it was also used as a school. Two Rhenish missionaries, Carl Hugo Hahn and Franz Heinrich Kleinschmidt, started working there in late 1842. Two years later they were driven out by two Methodist Wesleyans, Richard Haddy and Joseph Tindall. Gardens were laid out and for a while <b>Windhoek</b> prospered. Wars between the Nama and Herero peoples eventually destroyed the settlement. After a long absence, Hahn visited <b>Windhoek</b> again in 1873 and was dismayed to see that nothing remained of the town's former prosperity. In June 1885, a Swiss botanist found only jackals and starving guinea fowl amongst neglected fruit trees.|$|E
