60|$|P.S.--Since I {{wrote the}} foregoing, Mr. McCrackan's article {{appeared}} (in the March {{number of the}} North American Review). Before his article appeared--that is to say, during December, January, and February--I had <b>written</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> a character-portrait of Mrs. Eddy, drawn from her own acts and words, and it was then--together with the three brief articles previously published in the North American Review--ready to be delivered to the printer for issue in book form. In that book, by accident and good luck, I have answered the objections made by Mr. McCrackan to my views, and therefore {{do not need to}} add an answer here. Also, in it I have corrected certain misstatements of mine which he has noticed, and several others which he has not referred to. There are one or two important matters of opinion upon which he and I are not in disagreement; but there are others upon which we must continue to disagree, I suppose; indeed, I know we must; for instance, he believes Mrs. Eddy wrote Science and Health, whereas I am quite sure I can convince a person unhampered by predilections that she did not.|$|E

40|$|Almost {{four years}} ago, I was {{intrigued}} by a very incisive and provocative editorial 1 in the Wall Street Journal by J. D. Kleinke, a noted healthcare economist. The editorial spoke of an industrial revolution coming to medicine based on a rationalization of the haphazard use of services, an improvement in quality, {{and a reduction in}} costs. Now, the same author has <b>written</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> entitled, The Bleeding Edge, 2 published recently by Aspen Publishers. I thought our readership would be interested in his detailed thesis about the future, focused on the ascendancy of a new business entity in health care, the EHO—the Emerging Healthcare Organization. The central thesis of this fascinating book is that five key forces will culminate in the transformation of the health care industry to a world of EHOs characterized by decreased costs, an increase in quality, and the "liberation " of physicians from the perceived bonds of managed care. Let me first note these five forces and define them; then, we will explore Kleinke’s vision for each of these forces in turn. The key question that Kleinke addresses is, "How do we transform 15 % of the world’s largest economy? " The interaction among these five forces provides the driving energy fo...|$|E
