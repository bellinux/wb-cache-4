25|$|The 1960s were {{years of}} {{unprecedented}} {{economic growth in}} the Tennessee Valley. Electric rates were among the nation's lowest and stayed low as TVA brought larger, more efficient generating units into service. Expecting the Valley's electric power needs to continue to grow, TVA began building nuclear reactors as a new source of cheap power. During this decade (and the 1970s), TVA was engaged in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to that time its most controversial project – the Tellico Dam Project. The project was initially conceived in the 1940s but not completed until 1979.|$|E
25|$|Paisley {{released}} his book Diary of a Player: How My Musical Heroes Made a Guitar Man Out of Me in 2011 under Howard Books Publishing. He co-wrote {{the book with}} author David Wild, {{a contributing editor for}} Rolling Stone magazine and an Emmy nominated TV writer and producer. The book is an autobiography and talks about Paisley's introduction to the music industry and how the events in his life helped to prepare him for <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> ahead. The book features topics such as the first guitar that his grandfather gave him, his first band the C-notes, the first song he wrote, and many more music/guitar related topics. Although the book does speak briefly of his personal life, the main focus is on his music and the start of his career.|$|E

Gail Pennington of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch {{wrote that the}} live episode [...] "proved {{once and for all}} that Will & Grace should have been buried before now," [...] and Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk pointed out that its underlying storyline [...] "is a little too over-the-top." [...] Jessica Banov of The Fayetteville Observer wrote, [...] "The first live show... was so-so. The lighting was weird, and I'm not sure <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> with Debra Messing's hair. But it was funny to see Messing and Sean Hayes break from their scripts to giggle." [...] Cinquemani commented that Baldwin's [...] "absurd" [...] role as Malcolm [...] "is proving to be one of Will & Graces most enduring guest stars." [...] David Blum of The New York Sun reported that the producers of Will & Grace wasted Baldwin's [...] "prodigious talents on a supporting role this past season, when it's clear he could effortlessly carry his own network series." [...] Kauffman concluded that Grace's joke about George Bush being brain dead [...] "just falls amazingly flat".|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{the design}} of U.S. central office (phone) switches, it was not {{practical}} to use the British emergency number 999 (as was briefly considered). <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to that time unassigned area code 911 was chosen instead. The [...] "1" [...] as the second digit was key; it told the switching equipment {{that this was not}} a routine call. The first 911 emergency phone system went into use in Haleyville, Alabama in 1968. On February 16, 1968, the first-ever 9-1-1 call was placed by Alabama Speaker of the House Rankin Fite, from Haleyville City Hall, to U.S. Rep. Tom Bevill, at the city's police station. [...] However, 911 systems were not in widespread use until the 1980s when the number 911 was adopted as the standard number across most of the country under the North American Numbering Plan.|$|E
2500|$|On May 16, 2011, {{the group}} {{announced}} they were demoing new material at vocalist/bassist Nik Bruzzese's studio, Small Hill Recording Studio. When the group began demoing [...] "everyone just {{worked so well}} together," [...] according to Wildrick. The band had 17 songs, which they would later narrow down before recording, which began in early June and ended before the band's European tour with Polar Bear Club. Recording took place at Cannon Found Soundation Studios in New Jersey with New Found Glory guitarist Steve Klein acting as producer, and providing additional engineering. These sessions were Klein's first attempt at producing an album, causing him to remark later that he felt [...] "like a proud father". Upon entering the studio, Klein [...] "told them <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>up.</b> ... {{to have the opportunity}} to help shape their record and contribute to their career was a great thing".|$|E
2500|$|Among those {{expelled}} was {{the family}} of Sendel and Riva Grynszpan, Polish Jews who had emigrated to Germany in 1911 and settled in Hanover, Germany. At the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961, Sendel Grynszpan recounted the events of their deportation from Hanover {{on the night of}} 27 October 1938: [...] "Then they took us in police trucks, in prisoners' lorries, about 20 men in each truck, and they took us to the railway station. The streets were full of people shouting: Juden raus! Auf nach Palästina!" [...] ("Jews out, out to Palestine!"). Their seventeen-year-old son Herschel was living in Paris with an uncle. Herschel received a postcard from his family from the Polish border, describing the family's expulsion: [...] "No one told us <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>up,</b> but we realised {{this was going to be}} the end ... We haven't a penny. Could you send us something?" [...] He received the postcard on 3 November 1938.|$|E

2500|$|Reform of {{the liturgy}} had {{been a part of}} the liturgical {{movements}} in the 20th century mainly in France, and Germany which were officially recognized by Pius XII in his encyclical Mediator Dei. During the pontificate of Pius XII, the Vatican eased regulations on the use of Latin in Roman Catholic liturgies, permitting some use of vernacular languages during baptisms, funerals and other events. In 1951 and 1955, the Easter liturgies underwent revision, most notably including the reintroduction of the Easter Triduum. The Second Vatican Council made no changes to the Roman Missal, but in the document Sacrosanctum Concilium mandated that a general revision of it take place. [...] After the Vatican Council, in April 1969, Paul VI approved the [...] "new Order of Mass" [...] promulgated in 1970, as stated in the Acta Apostolica Sedis to [...] "end experimentation" [...] with the Mass and which included the introduction of three new Eucharistic Prayers to <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to then a single Roman Canon.|$|E
2500|$|Five days later, on July 29, 1946, {{a routine}} motor patrol (made up from B Battery, 11th Marines and a mortar squad from the 5th Marine regiment)– {{consisting}} of one lieutenant and forty enlisted men - was escorting six supply trucks from Tientsin to Peking {{when it was}} ambushed {{near the village of}} Anping by a strong force of uniformed Communists, who were armed with automatic weapons, rifles, and hand grenades. The ensuing battle lasted four hours. A relief column with air support from Tientsin attempted to trap and destroy the Communists, but it failed to arrive in time. Three Marines, Lt. Douglas Cowin, Cpl Gilbert Tate, and PFC Larry Punch were killed and twelve others were wounded during <b>what</b> <b>was,</b> <b>up</b> to that point, the most serious clash between American and Chinese forces. One other Marine, PFC John Lopez, later died of wounds received in the battle, and two more were injured when they crashed their Jeep while returning to Tientsin for aid. According to Shaw, [...] "the deliberate Communist ambush was additional proof that the chances for peace in China were nonexistent. Without regard to their truce agreements, both sides initiated hostilities wherever the military situation seemed to favor them, and 'each side took the stand with General Marshall that the other was provoking the fighting and could not be trusted to go through with an agreement.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that once Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah was {{standing}} on a step on the Temple Mount, and Ben Zoma (who was younger than Rabbi Joshua) saw him but did not stand up before him in respect. So Rabbi Joshua asked Ben Zoma <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>up.</b> Ben Zoma replied that {{he was staring at}} the space between the upper and the lower waters (described in [...] ). Ben Zoma said that there is only a bare three fingers' space between the upper and the lower waters. Ben Zoma reasoned that [...] says, [...] "And the spirit of God hovered over the face of the waters," [...] implying a distance similar to that of a mother dove that hovers over her young without touching them. But Rabbi Joshua told his disciples that Ben Zoma was still outside the realm of understanding. Rabbi Joshua noted that [...] says that [...] "the spirit of God hovered over the face of the water" [...] {{on the first day of}} Creation, but God divided the waters on the second day, as [...] reports. (And thus the distance that God hovered above the waters need not be the distance between the upper and lower waters). The Gemara presented various views of how great the distance is between the upper and the lower waters. Rav Aha bar Jacob said that the distance was a hair's breadth. The Rabbis said that the distance was like that between the planks of a bridge. Mar Zutra (or some say Rav Assi) said that the distance was like that between two cloaks spread one over another. And others said that the distance was like that between two cups nested one inside the other..|$|E
