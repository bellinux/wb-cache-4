5|$|He {{finds the}} mixture of bird species {{intermediate}} between those of Java and Australia, with 36 species actually Javan, and 11 closely related; while there are only 13 actually Australian, with 35 closely related. Wallace interprets this to mean that {{a small number of}} birds from Australia, and a larger number from Java, colonised Timor and then evolved into new species endemic to the island. The land mammals were very few in number: the six species were endemic or related to those of Java or the Moluccas, <b>with</b> <b>none</b> from Australia, so he doubts there was ever a land bridge to that continent.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} {{conceived}} by Yoshinori Kitase, the original game's director, and Tetsuya Nomura, {{the main character}} designer. Nomura would become the main designer for each entry in the Compilation. Other returning staff include writer Kazushige Nojima, art director Yusuke Naora, and composer Nobuo Uematsu. The video games belong to different genres, <b>with</b> <b>none</b> of them being traditional role-playing games due to production pressures related to the genre. While the first title revealed was Advent Children, it ran into delays during post-production, so the first Compilation title to be released was the mobile game Before Crisis.|$|E

5|$|By the 1950s, {{railroad}} traffic declined {{and parts}} of Depot Town began to fall into disrepair. The Thompson Block was put up for sale in 1950, standing vacant {{for more than a}} year.

In May 2006, Stewart Beal purchased the building outright.|$|E
5|$|Despite 1980's playoff defeat, the Browns {{were widely}} {{expected}} to be even better the following year. But 1981 came <b>with</b> <b>none</b> of the comebacks or late-game magic the Kardiac Kids were known for. Several games were close, but most were losses. Sipe threw only 17 touchdowns and was intercepted 25 times. The team finished 5–11. The 1982 NFL strike, which began in September and lasted until mid-November, shortened the regular season the following year to nine games. Coming off a poor year, Sipe split starts with his backup, Paul McDonald, and neither {{was able to bring}} back the old Kardiac Kids spark. The team ended with a 4–5 record, which qualified for an expanded Super Bowl playoff tournament created to accommodate the shorter season. The Browns faced the Raiders in a rematch of 1980's playoff thriller. This time, though, McDonald was the starter and the ending was far from tense. The Raiders won 27–10.|$|E

5|$|Iguanodon teeth are, as {{the name}} suggests, like those of an iguana, but larger. Unlike hadrosaurids, which had columns of {{replacement}} teeth, Iguanodon only had one replacement tooth at a time for each position. The upper jaw held up to 29 teeth per side, <b>with</b> <b>none</b> {{at the front of}} the jaw, and the lower jaw 25; the numbers differ because teeth in the lower jaw are broader than those in the upper. Because the tooth rows are deeply inset from the outside of the jaws, and because of other anatomical details, it is believed that, as with most other ornithischians, Iguanodon had some sort of cheek-like structure, muscular or non-muscular, to retain food in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|In a {{world where}} toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when humans are present, a group of toys, owned by six-year-old Andy Davis, are caught off-guard when Andy's {{birthday}} party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother, and infant sister Molly, are preparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, a pull-string cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody, organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Slinky Dog, into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge, spy on the party, and report the results to the others via baby monitors. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end <b>with</b> <b>none</b> of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift – an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear, who thinks he is an actual space ranger.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1977 Amtrak faced a power crisis. In {{addition}} to the SDP40Fs derailing, Amtrak was having trouble with two other six-axle designs. The GE E60CP and E60CH electric locomotives were having derailment problems as well; the GE P30CH had the same truck design as E60s and rode poorly, although it did not exhibit the same tendency to derail. Amtrak decided to abandon the SDP40F {{in favor of the}} F40PH, a four-axle design <b>with</b> <b>none</b> of the riding problems of the six-axle locomotives. Amtrak traded 40 SDP40Fs back to EMD; components including the prime mover were installed into an F40PH's frame. Between 1977–1987 Amtrak would trade 132 of the SDP40Fs back to EMD for F40PHRs. The SDP40F remained in service on the Santa Fe longer than anywhere else, although the arrival of HEP-equipped Superliner cars on the Western routes displaced them from there as well. The last SDP40Fs left the Amtrak roster in 1987.|$|E
