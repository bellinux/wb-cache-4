25|$|Meanwhile, on March 10, 1826, his father, King João VI, {{died and}} his brother Peter, the heir-apparent to the throne, became king as Peter IV. Peter, however, was {{committed}} to continuing as Emperor of Brazil and therefore abdicated the crown of Portugal in favor of his daughter, Maria II. Since the young sovereign was not yet of age, he instituted a regency, under his sister, Isabel Maria. Peter had already attempted to coerce Miguel to Brazil (1822) away from their mother without any success. Following {{the death of their}} father, Peter once again attempted to mend fences within the family and ensure Maria II's right to the throne by offering Miguel the regency of Portugal (when he became 25) under a new liberal Constitutional Charter that would re-establish a constitutional monarchy. Under this arrangement, Queen Maria II and Miguel would be married when she came of age; until then Miguel would be her regent in Portugal. The new Constitutional Charter gave the crown moderating authority between the legislative, executive and judiciary, and introduced a 100-member Chamber of Peers (which included aristocrats and bishops and archbishops), a royal veto and indirect elections. Miguel accepted the proposal from his brother, swore to uphold the Constitutional Charter and, since the young Queen was only nine years old, <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> would reach the age of marriage.|$|E
500|$|The inquest into Davison's death {{took place}} at Epsom on 10 June; Jones was not well enough to attend. Davison's half-brother, Captain Henry Davison, gave {{evidence}} about his sister, saying that she was [...] "a woman of very strong reasoning faculties, and passionately devoted to the women's movement". The coroner decided that, {{in the absence of}} evidence to the contrary, Davison had not committed suicide. The coroner also decided that, although she had <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> could see the horses, [...] "from the evidence {{it was clear that the}} woman did not make for His Majesty's horse in particular". The verdict of the court was: ...|$|E
2500|$|She still didn't stop {{moving so}} I stabbed {{her in the}} front of the chest. I was aiming for her heart. I needed two hands to get the knife through her chest. She kept moving so I kicked her in the head a couple of times. She still kept moving but she was slowing down. I <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> stopped moving which didn't take long.

2500|$|Her first {{marriage}} was to Halifax lawyer, Peter McDonough, {{with whom she}} had two sons: Justin and Travis. [...] In 1993 she separated from Peter McDonough, and is now divorced from him, though she claims that her political career did not play a part in it. In 1994, just before she stepped down as Nova Scotia leader, she had a hysterectomy, and <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> recuperated before she announced her resignation. During her time as leader of the federal NDP, McDonough was romantically involved with David MacDonald, a former Progressive Conservative (PC) MP for Toronto Centre—Rosedale and a cabinet minister. MacDonald ran as the NDP candidate in Toronto Centre—Rosedale in the 1997 election; in the previous election, he was the PC incumbent, and like every other PC candidate in Ontario in 1993, was defeated. The pair split up prior to the 2004 federal election ...|$|E
2500|$|Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses, saying: [...] "He {{married a}} Cushite woman!" [...] and [...] "Has the Lord spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us as well?" [...] God heard and called Moses, Aaron, and Miriam {{to come to}} the Tent of Meeting. God came down in cloud and called out to Aaron and Miriam: [...] "When a prophet of the Lord arises among you, I make Myself known to him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream. Not so with My servant Moses; he is trusted {{throughout}} My household. With him I speak mouth to mouth, plainly and not in riddles, and he beholds the likeness of the Lord. How then did you not shrink from speaking against My servant Moses!" [...] As the cloud withdrew, Miriam was stricken with snow-white scales. Moses cried out to God, [...] "O God, pray heal her!" [...] But God said to Moses, [...] "If her father spat in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days? Let her be shut out of camp for seven days." [...] And the people <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> rejoined the camp.|$|E

60|$|Jernyngham {{looked hard}} {{at her and}} made a gesture which {{suggested}} that the matter would not bear discussion. Then Colston began to talk to her, and he was glad when the meal was finished. Muriel <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> found Gertrude alone in her room.|$|E
60|$|All fell in noiselessly {{behind the}} cart, and slowly they all {{started down the}} dark road.

60|$|Once more poor Mrs. Quack {{was quite}} {{overcome}} with her troubles and sorrows.

60|$|Having {{reached that}} conclusion--pregnant with coming assaults on the weakly-fortified {{discretion}} of poor Mrs. Wragge--the housekeeper cautiously abstained from exhibiting herself any longer under an inquisitive aspect.

60|$|Then {{she came}} towards {{the house and}} Helen felt half-annoyed and half-amused. Stephen {{did not like to}} be {{disturbed}} when he was busy, and she knew what he thought of Bob.

60|$|Alethea went, and Lilias lingered by the fire.
