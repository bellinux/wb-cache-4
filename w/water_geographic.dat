40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The Safe Drinking Water Act {{ensures that}} public systems provide water that meets health standards. However, no such {{protection}} exists {{for millions of}} Americans who obtain water from private wells. Concern for safety is warranted as most wells draw from underground aquifers, and studies demonstrate that groundwater is affected by a range of contaminants, most often nitrate. Oregon's Domestic Well Testing Act (DWTA) links well testing to property sales, enabling continuous data collection by the State. This research addresses a need for identifying datasets for characterizing exposure to private well contaminants by evaluating DWTA data {{for use in a}} sentinel surveillance system. Validation of DWTA data was accomplished by developing a land use regression (LUR) model based on agricultural nitrogen inputs and soil leachability to predict nitrate concentrations in well <b>water.</b> <b>Geographic</b> information systems (GIS) were used to advance methods for high resolution spatial modeling of fertilizer and manure nitrogen with statewide coverage. Hazard mapping with these datasets suggests that nearly half of recently drilled wells are susceptible to nitrate contamination. Spearman's rank correlation demonstrated a significant correlation between LUR-predicted nitrate levels and levels reported in the DWTA dataset. These results suggest that DWTA data is valid for use in a sentinel surveillance system, such that evidence of nitrate contamination in a single well may indicate an area-wide health hazard. However, a low fraction of variance explained by the LUR model highlighted the need for specific improvements to datasets crucial for understanding nitrate contamination in well water, including the DWTA...|$|E

30|$|Groundwater is an {{important}} issue for successful crop production and to assure food security in developing countries of the world. It {{is one of the most}} vital widely geospatially distributed valuable natural resources that play a great role in sustainable green socioeconomic development and environmental protection in the world especially in arid and semiarid regions of the glove. Groundwater resources are used for various purposes throughout the world that should be continuously determined and investigated (Arslan 2017). Water quality is a term used to describe the physical, chemical and biological parameters of water characteristics concerning its suitability for a particular utilization (Diersing and Nancy 2009). Determining groundwater quality in developing countries has become a critical issue due to surface water scarcity. Groundwater quality and quantity is a dynamic process that has equal importance (Omran et al. 2014). Exercising irrigation action has {{an important}} role to elevate irrigation production rate and to meet continuously increasing food demands of the growing population (Alemu and Desta 2017). Irrigation water quality is evaluated by the total amounts of soluble salts and the types of salts present within the irrigation <b>water.</b> <b>Geographic</b> information system (GIS) is a powerful computer-based technology that is used to manage, understand, manipulate, process, integrate, model, identify vulnerable and suitable groundwater zones, analyze and display geospatially groundwater data sets. GIS is a powerful tool to map groundwater vulnerability to solve and determine water quality problems, to assess water availability, to prevent flooding and degradation, understanding the natural environment and managing water resources at a local and regional level (Tjandra et al. 2003; Al-Rawabdeh et al. 2014; Hussain et al. 2017). Geostatistics and geographic information systems are commonly employed to determine spatial and temporal distributions of groundwater and soil characteristics (Jasmin and Mallikarjuna 2014). The combination of GIS and geostatistical analysis is becoming an important tool for groundwater studies (Manap et al. 2013). Irrigation groundwater quality index (IWQI) model is also an efficient tool to determine, classify and manage the overall groundwater quality as a single parameter. It measures the quality of water for different purposes by transferring several water variables to give only a single value to determine the overall water quality (Akter et al. 2016; Boateng et al. 2016). WQI is a mathematical model used to convert a lot of water quality variables into a single indicator value which represents the water quality level at a certain location and time (Rabeiy 2017; Boah et al. 2015).|$|E

40|$|International audienceSharks {{are a major}} {{component}} of the top predator guild in oceanic ecosystems, but their trophic relationships remain poorly understood. We examined chemical tracers of diet and habitat (δ 15 N and δ 13 C, respectively) and total mercury (Hg) concentrations in muscle tissue of seven pelagic sharks: blue shark (Prionace glauca), short-fin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus), scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini), pelagic thresher shark (Alopias pelagicus), crocodile shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai) and silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), from the data poor south-western tropical Indian Ocean. Minimal interspecific variation in mean δ 15 N values and a large degree of isotopic niche overlap - driven by high intraspecific variation in δ 15 N values - was observed among pelagic sharks. Similarly, δ 13 C values of sharks overlapped considerably for all species with the exception of P. glauca, which had more 13 C-depleted values indicating possibly longer residence times in purely pelagic <b>waters.</b> <b>Geographic</b> variation in δ 13 C, δ 15 N and Hg were observed for P. glauca and I. oxyrinchus. Mean Hg levels were similar among species with the exception of P. kamoharai which had significantly higher Hg concentrations likely related to mesopelagic feeding. Hg concentrations increased with body size in I. oxyrinchus, P. glauca and C. longimanus. Values of δ 15 N and δ 13 C varied with size only in P. glauca, suggesting ontogenetic shifts in diets or habitats. Together, isotopic data indicate that – with few exceptions - variance within species in trophic interactions or foraging habitats is greater than differentiation among pelagic sharks in the south-western Indian Ocean. Therefore, it is possible that this group exhibits some level of trophic redundancy, but further studies of diets and fine-scale habitat use are needed to fully test this hypothesis...|$|R
