5|$|Textiles {{are made}} from both animal fibres, {{including}} <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> silk, and plant fibres, including cotton and flax. Dyestuffs too are made both from animals, including carmine from the bodies of insects, and from plants, including indigo, , and lichens.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wool</b> <b>and</b> hides {{were the}} major exports {{in the late}} Middle Ages. From 1327 to 1332, the {{earliest}} period for which figures survive, the annual average was 5,700 sacks of <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> 36,100 leather hides. The disruption of the Wars of Independence, which not only limited trade but damaged much of the valuable agricultural land of the Borders and Lowlands, meant that this fell in the period 1341–42 to 1342–43 to 2,450 sacks of <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> 17,900 hides. The trade recovered to reach a peak in the 1370s, with an annual average of 7,360 sacks, but the international recession from the 1380s saw a reduction to an annual average of 3,100 sacks. The introduction of sheep-scab was a serious blow to the wool trade from the early fifteenth century. Despite a levelling-off, in the Low Countries there was another drop in exports as the markets collapsed in the early-sixteenth century. Unlike in England, this did not prompt the Scots to turn to large-scale cloth production and only poor-quality rough cloths {{seem to have been}} significant.|$|E

5|$|During the 14th century, {{however, the}} castle had {{declined}} and became abandoned. In 1398 Richard II had the lead {{taken from the}} castle roofs for reuse at Portchester Castle. In 1660, visitors' accounts imply that the stonework had all been dismantled, and 18th-century accounts suggest that this was reused for construction work in the town below, which had prospered from the <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> later linen trade.|$|E

5|$|The {{types of}} {{clothing}} worn and {{the materials used}} during the Han period depended upon social class.

5|$|The <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> cloth {{trade was}} {{primarily}} now {{being run by}} English merchants themselves rather than by foreigners. Increasingly, the trade was also passing through London and the ports of the South-West. By the 1360s, 66–75% of the export trade was in English hands and by the 15th century this had risen to 80%; London managed around 50% of these exports in 1400, {{and as much as}} 83% of <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> cloth exports by 1540. The growth in the numbers of chartered trading companies in London, such as the Worshipful Company of Drapers or the Company of Merchant Adventurers of London, continued, and English producers began to provide credit to European buyers, {{rather than the other way}} around. Usury grew during the period, and few cases were prosecuted by the authorities.|$|E
5|$|Trade over vast {{areas of}} the Mediterranean was {{essential}} for the economy of Mycenaean Greece. The Mycenaean palaces imported raw materials, such as metals, ivory and glass, and exported processed commodities and objects made from these materials, in addition to local products: oil, perfume, wine, <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> pottery. International trade of that time was not only conducted by palatial emissaries but also by independent merchants.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study 359 Corriedale sheep(male 25 and female 334) born in 1956 at the Iwate Stock Breeding Farm and the Takikawa Stock Breeding Farm were used as {{experimental}} animals, <b>and</b> their <b>wool</b> yields(raw wool yield, clean <b>wool</b> yield <b>and</b> clean yield percentage) per animal per year and the other fleece characters(staple length, <b>wool</b> fineness <b>and</b> <b>wool</b> density) of wool sample were determined and {{the relation between the}} <b>wool</b> yield <b>and</b> the other fleece characters of sheep, classified by the stock breeding farm, sex and age, were investigated, calculating the correlation and regression coefficients of the wool yields on the other fleece characters. The results obtained from the experiments were as follows: 1) Though a few significant correlations were found respectively between the staple length of <b>wool</b> sample <b>and</b> the raw <b>wool</b> yield(r= 0. 28 and 0. 29), <b>and</b> clean <b>wool</b> yield(r= 0. 34 ～ 0. 54), and clean yield percentage(r= 0. 42 and 0. 58) of entire fleece of Corriedale sheep, it was found that those correlations were not high. 2) In general there was a trend that the correlations beetween the staple length of <b>wool</b> sample <b>and</b> the clean <b>wool</b> yield of whole fleece were higher than those between the staple length of <b>wool</b> sample <b>and</b> the raw <b>wool</b> yield of whole fleece. 3) A few significantly high correlations were observed between the wool fineness of <b>wool</b> sample <b>and</b> the raw <b>wool</b> yield(r= 0. 37 ～ 0. 82) <b>and</b> clean <b>wool</b> yield(r= 0. 34 ～ 0. 80), and clean yield percentage(r= 0. 28 and 0. 34) of whole fleece, but on the whole those correlations were found to be low and in particular the correlations between the <b>wool</b> fineness <b>and</b> the clean yield percentage found to be insignificant and low. 4) Significant correlations between the wool density of <b>wool</b> sample <b>and</b> the raw <b>wool</b> yield(r= 0. 27), <b>and</b> clean <b>wool</b> yield(r= 0. 32), and clean yield percentage(r= 0. 38) of entire fleece were only found on female sheep of three years of age and the low correlations, either positive or negative, were found on female sheep of the other years of age. 5) No variations of a definite trend, increasing or decreasing, with advance in age were found on the correlations of the staple length, <b>wool</b> fineness <b>and</b> <b>wool</b> density to the other fleece characters(raw wool yield, clean <b>wool</b> yield <b>and</b> clean yield percentage) respectively...|$|R

5|$|A Roman Catholic, Dacey was {{influenced}} in his political opinions by protectionism and the rerum novarum, which supported people's {{right to join}} trade unions. He combined these beliefs with his experience with the <b>Wool</b> <b>and</b> Basil Workers Union and the Labor platform. He was an anti-billite, meaning that he was against Federation, and spoke against it, for example at Coraki, New South Wales on 15 June 1899, based on his opposition to free trade.|$|E
5|$|A last {{group of}} sheep breeds {{is that of}} fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all. Hair sheep {{are similar to the}} early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the Dorper, result from crosses between <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing. Hair sheep are also more {{resistant}} to parasites and hot weather.|$|E

5|$|At 8:10am Captain Brown {{ordered a}} course change to 060degrees and {{informed}} {{the men that}} the conn for the battleship would remain on the eighth-level bridge until they cleared the course. This was unusual for Missouri, as the conn was usually shifted to the fourth-level bridge during the transit at the point when a ship passed Fort <b>Wool</b> <b>and</b> Old Point Comfort. The initial course change to 060 was altered to 058 {{as a result of}} a strong ocean current that swung Missouri too far to the right during the course correction.|$|E
5|$|Domestic sheep are {{relatively}} small ruminants, usually with a crimped hair called <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> often with horns forming a lateral spiral. Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely neotenic {{as a result of}} selective breeding by humans. A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.e. polled), or horns in both sexes, or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.|$|E
5|$|For the poor, hemp was {{the common}} item {{used to make}} clothing, while the rich could afford silk clothes. Silk clothes found in Han tombs include padded robes, {{double-layered}} robes, single-layered robes, single-layered skirts, shoes, socks, and mittens. The wealthy also wore fox and badger furs, wild duck plumes, and slippers with inlaid leather or silk lining; those of more modest means could wear <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> ferret skins. Large bamboo-matted suitcases found in Han tombs contained clothes and luxury items such as patterned fabric and embroidery, common silk, damask and brocade, and the leno (or gauze) weave, all with rich colors and designs.
