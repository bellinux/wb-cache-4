40|$|We {{present a}} 19 -year-old patient with hematologic and {{neurologic}} manifestations associated with Wilsonâ€™s disease. Idiopathic thrombocytopenia was diagnosed in October 2009. Bone marrow aspiration was normal. Gradually her neurologic and psychiatric symptoms emerged, dysarthria, <b>writing</b> <b>apraxia,</b> learning difficulties, emotionalism and eventually dystonia of hands. The serum ceruloplasmin was low, and the Kayser Fleischer's ring was positive. MRI {{of the brain}} showed abnormality in the bilateral basal ganglia, brain stem and superior cerebellar peduncles without post-contrast enhancement...|$|E

Problems in the ability to comprehend or communicate with symbols, asymbolia, was first established by Finkelnburg. This idea of representational disturbance instead of disturbance in movement is still present in the current discussion of aphasia and BPO pantomimes. In 1905, Liepmann conducted a study of brain injured patients. He <b>wrote</b> of ideokinetic <b>apraxia,</b> the dissociation between the idea of movement of a real or imagined object and its implementation. Problems with gestures and pantomimes were considered to be a category of apraxia. He concluded that the control of effortful movements was in the left hemisphere and that aphasia could indicate lesions in the brain. Various other theories regarding gestural deficits of aphasics have been put forward since then, including intellectual degradation, and the inability to carry out pretended actions. Denny-Brown [...] takes a more holistic approach and suggested ideational apraxia results from diffuse brain damage.|$|R
