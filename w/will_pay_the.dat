5|$|There {{was popular}} {{sentiment}} by fans for the Pirates {{to name the}} stadium after former outfielder Roberto Clemente. However, locally based PNC Financial Services purchased the stadium's naming rights in August 1998. As per the agreement, PNC Bank <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> Pirates approximately $2million each year through 2020, and also has a full-service PNC branch at the stadium. The total cost of PNC Park was $216million. Shortly after the naming rights deal was announced, the city of Pittsburgh renamed the 6th Street Bridge near {{the southeast corner of}} the site of the park the Roberto Clemente Bridge as a compromise to fans who had wanted the park named after Clemente.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the current}} process, when the NPB team notifies the MLB Commissioner of a posting, it also sets the posting fee, {{which is now}} capped at a maximum of $20million. Once the MLB Commissioner announces the posting and the fee, the player has 30days to sign with an MLB team. Unlike the past system, in which only the team that won the bidding process had {{negotiating}} rights, the current system allows the posted player to negotiate with any MLB team {{willing to pay the}} posting fee. As in the previous process, if the player signs with an MLB team during the negotiating window, the signing team <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> posting fee; otherwise, his rights revert to his NPB team. Also mirroring the past system, an unsuccessfully posted player can request a posting in a later year, with the process repeated.|$|E

25|$|The {{danger of}} {{overpricing}} {{is also an}} important consideration.

Even if they sell all of the issued shares, the stock may fall in value {{on the first day of}} trading. If so, the stock may lose its marketability and hence even more of its value. This could result in losses for investors, many of whom being the most favored clients of the underwriters. Perhaps the best known example of this is the Facebook IPO in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The Coens {{wrote and}} {{directed}} the crime thriller Fargo (1996), set in their home state of Minnesota. Jerry Lundegaard (William H.

His plan goes wrong when the kidnappers deviate from the plan and local cop Marge Gunderson (McDormand) starts to investigate. Produced on a small budget of $7 million, Fargo was a critical and commercial success, with particular praise for its dialogue and McDormand's performance. The film received several awards, including a BAFTA award and Cannes award for direction, and two Oscars: a Best Original Screenplay and a Best Actress Oscar for McDormand.|$|E
25|$|The Cuban state {{claims to}} adhere to socialist {{principles}} in organizing its largely state-controlled planned economy. Most {{of the means of}} production are owned and run by the government and most of the labor force is employed by the state. Recent years have seen a trend toward more private sector employment. By 2006, public sector employment was 78% and private sector 22%, compared to 91.8% to 8.2% in 1981. Government spending is 78.1% of GDP. Any firm wishing to hire a Cuban must pay the Cuban government, which in turn <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> employee in Cuban pesos. The average monthly wage as of July 2013 is 466 Cuban pesos, which are worth about US$19.|$|E

The groom's family is then welcomed into the family and traditional beer, Umqombothi, will be prepared for the groom's family as a token of appreciation from the bride's family.|$|E
25|$|In January 2009, a {{previously}} unknown crypt was discovered when a tourist on a self-guided tour through the cemetery {{fell through the}} ground into {{what appeared to be}} a stairway leading to a crypt. The stairway had been covered with a piece of slate which eventually gave way due to advanced age. (The tourist was not hurt, nor did she come into contact with any human remains.) The crypt is reported to be 8 by 12 feet and is structurally intact. It is possibly the resting place of Jonathan Armitage, a Boston selectman from 1732 to 1733. Officials from the City of Boston announced in May, 2011 a $300,000 refurbishment project designed to repair and restore the historic site, including widening paths in the cemetery and providing new observation sites. $125,000 will be provided by the Freedom Trail Foundation and the city <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> rest.|$|E
25|$|State funding has, historically, {{been very}} high at the University of California. In 1987, the state {{provided}} 54% of the UC Berkeley's budget. However, {{due in part}} to the 2008–11 California budget crisis, recent educational appropriations to the university have seen a significant decline. State educational appropriations such as general support given in the state's annual budget, and appropriations given to the state through the federal American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) dropped $37M in 2010–11 from the previous calendar year. In 2013, state general support dropped to 12% of the university's total revenues. State budget shortfalls as well as rising costs in pensions have been cited by the university as two of the leading reasons for its current financial woes. In response to revenue shortfalls, the UC Regents have raised tuition, and the university is trying to increase the number of non-resident undergraduates, who <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> more costly out-of-state tuition. Nearly one-third of revenues from tuition and other student fees are returned to students as scholarships and fellowships.|$|E

The person, King Fergus, is met by a witch who asks what he wants and he says he needs something to ensure the future of his kingdom and says he <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> <b>the</b> price. She says he can pay her later and calls it an IOU and offers him a contract to sign and he stamps it with his signet ring. She says it’s a deal and she blends up a potion using a pluck of his hair. Later on, Fergus and Merida walking among the clans. Fergus says he’ll take the tongue of the next man who disrespects her. She sees the men writing and thinks they’re sending love notes but Fergus says they’re writing their last will and testaments. Fergus also gave Merida his prized bow that she can carry into her first battle, and Merida thanked her father for keeping her safe. Merida pulls a sword and challenges the man who knocks her down, but the person who defeated her was Mulan, who says she can teach her how to fight better than any man there and will teach her honor as well. Some of the men watching mock her and call Mulan her nursemaid, but tells her no one will follow her out of fear and says to ask her father since they already follow him. Later that day, Merida came looking for him by the water. He says the invaders are sailing in and he’s watching for them. She asks if they will win the war and then says she wants to know how he inspired all these men to follow him into battle. He looks at the helm and she asks if everything is all right. Fergus says you have to show you’re the first one willing to die and says that tells them how important it is. He tells her he’s the Bear King and can face anything. She sees her father with the helm and discovers that Mulan had kept Merida from going with him. When she arrived and sees a knight coming towards Fergus, Merida aims an arrow at the knight, but misses as the knight kills Fergus. The Knight removes his helm, who is then revealed to be Arthur.|$|E
