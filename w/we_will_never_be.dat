The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> able to master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given a sentence P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if a sentence P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of a sentence, the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments {{in the life of the}} same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of a sentence and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E

Some of the lyrics reflect on his early life where he had to raise his sister and grow up at the same time. He added ambiguity to the lyrics to [...] "facilitate" [...] ideas for the listeners.

It was organized and written by screenwriter and author Ben Hecht and produced by Billy Rose and Ernst Lubitsch. The musical score was composed by Kurt Weill (1900-1950), and staged by Moss Hart (1904-1961), a leading Broadway producer. The pageant starred Edward G.

NBC News correspondent Richard Engel, covering the conflict, estimated {{that as many}} as one in five of the rebel fighters had taken up arms against Gaddafi out of the belief that the Libyan strongman was secretly Jewish. However, National Transitional Council Chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil invited Libyan Jewish representative David Gerbi to meet with him after the World Organization of Libyan Jews designated him the group's official delegate to the governing body. Gerbi was reportedly warmly received by Amazigh rebels in the Nafusa Mountains in August 2011, and an Amazigh NTC official was quoted as saying, [...] "We want to create closer relations between Muslims and Jews.

5000|$|After {{reviewing}} the controversy as regards possible plagiarism he suggests: [...] "Unless new documents emerge, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> probably <b>never</b> <b>be</b> {{able to establish}} with complete certainty whether Nietzsche plagiarized from Stirner. The circumstantial evidence provided by the published writings is strong, but only if one glosses over the many differences in the published writings as well. ... Nevertheless, I know of no other example of two philosophers whose works bear such a strong similarity, but where no debt of acknowledgement took place". Following Löwith, he concludes by offering the idea that Nietzsche most likely arrived at ideas similar to Stirner's because of the [...] "inevitable logic of post-Hegelian philosophy".|$|R

And, though we're uncertain that the reward is worth the risk, we yearn to surrender." [...] Fusilli also noted a closing phrase Wilson had once written to his wife in 1964: [...] "Yours 'til God wants us apart." [...] James Perone wrote: [...] "While Wilson's character may indeed {{be in love with}} the woman to whom he sings, there is a hint that part of this 'love' may be self-serving and part of a cycle of codependency."

2500|$|One of {{the most}} notable storylines {{featuring}} Pete revolved around the paternity of his alleged son, Simon Wicks (Nick Berry). Pete was shell-shocked to discover that Simon, was not really his child, {{and that he was}} possibly the son of his brother Kenny (Michael Attwell). The storyline spanned several years, since the arrival of Pete's first wife Pat (Pam St. Clement) in 1986, until the long-awaited showdown between Pete, Pat and Kenny in February 1988. The episode written by Tony McHale contained shocking revelations that would affect several relationships on the Square for years to come. In the on-screen events, Simon was shown to bond with Kenny, despite Pat admitting that she did not know which of the Beale brothers had fathered Wicksy. A final plot twist mid-1988 saw Pat finally reveal what she thought was the truth, that Simon's real father was Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield), Pat's second husband and Wicksy's adoptive father. Despite this revelation on-screen, writer Colin Brake stated in an official EastEnders book in 1994 that the true parentage of Simon was still uncertain {{in the minds of the}} producers. He stated, [...] "At various times over the years the story has been amended, until the only certainty is that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> certain about the actual facts."

50|$|Weill {{had all the}} {{necessary}} credentials to collaborate on <b>We</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Never</b> Die. As a German emigrant, son of a cantor, student of Ferruccio Busoni, and a born theater composer, he had mastered techniques for the effective use of music in both pageants and radio. He had used theater to highlight social concerns throughout his career. Although often characterized as a political composer because of his association in Germany with Bertolt Brecht, close analysis of his music and writings reveal him to be {{more concerned with the}} human condition than with political causes. His willingness to work on <b>We</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Never</b> Die <b>was</b> probably motivated more by the plight of the Jews in Europe than by a conviction to join Hecht in supporting Peter Bergson and the Committee for a Jewish Army of Stateless and Palestinian Jews.|$|R

30|$|The actual {{long-term}} effects of the fire on the tortoise population that <b>we</b> studied <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> fully understood {{due to the fact}} that data are not available for our study site under pre-fire conditions. As such, it is possible that the effects we hypothesized may have occurred in the short interval between the fire and the beginning of our study, less than two years later. Carefully designed before-and-after studies are needed on the effects of fire on the desert tortoise, but these will be difficult or impossible to conduct outside of serendipity due to the threatened status of tortoises. Until then, post hoc long-term studies like ours and others (Sanz-Aguilar et al. 2011) provide the best opportunity to understand how tortoises respond to the effects of fire over time. While awaiting additional studies, it is prudent to vigorously prevent and suppress wildland fires in tortoise habitat due to the known potential for direct mortality as noted previously by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (2011).|$|R
