60|$|MRS TARLETON. Drainage!! She'd tried three {{systems in}} her castle; {{and she was}} going to do away with them all and try another. I didnt know which way to look when she began talking about it: I thought theyd all have got up and gone out of the room. But not a bit of it, if you please. They were all just as bad as she. They all had systems; and each of them swore by her own system. I sat there with my cheeks burning until one of the duchesses, {{thinking}} I looked out of it, I suppose, asked me what system I had. I said I was sure I knew nothing about such things, and hadnt we better change the subject. Then the fat was in the fire, I can tell you. There was a regular terror of a countess with an anaerobic system; and she told me, downright brutally, that I'd better learn something about them before my children died of diphtheria. That was just two months after I'd buried poor little Bobby; and that was the very thing he died of, poor little lamb! I burst out crying: I couldnt help it. It was as good as telling me I'd killed my own child. I had to go away; but before I was out of the door one of the duchesses--quite a young woman--began talking about what sour milk did in her inside and how she expected to live to be over a hundred if she took it regularly. And me listening to her, that had never dared to think that a duchess could have anything so common as an inside! I shouldnt have minded if it had been children's insides: <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> them. But grown-up people! I was glad to get away that time.|$|E

5000|$|In {{discussing}} the 2004 American presidential elections, Wallis said [...] "Jesus didn’t speak {{at all about}} homosexuality.

[...] Some time between 2008 and 2013, Wallis changed his mind and began to support same-sex marriage. In 2008 he made the following remarks: [...] "I don't think the sacrament of marriage should be changed. Some people say that Jesus didn't talk about homosexuality, and that's technically true. But marriage is all through the Bible, and it's not gender-neutral. I have never done a blessing for a same-sex couple. I've never been asked to do one. I'm not sure that I would." [...] However, in an interview in 2013, Wallis declared his support for same-sex marriage, and said [...] "Marriage needs some strengthening. Let's start with marriage, and then I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> now, how to include same-sex couples in that deeper understanding of marriage." [...] In both statements, Wallis advocated respectful biblical and theological conversations between Christians who disagree on this issue, as well as focusing on other important issues such as poverty.|$|E

Owing to the prerequisite for low device complexity together with {{low energy consumption}} (i. e., long network lifetime), a proper balance between communication and signal/data processing capabilities must be established. This motivates a mammoth endeavour in research performance, standardization procedure, and engineering investments on this field since the last decade. This paper aims at reporting an overview of WSNs technologies, key applications and principles, characteristics in WSNs plan, and evolutions. In scrupulous, several unusual applications, such as those based on ecological monitoring, are discussed and design strategies painted; a case study based on an actual function is also reported. Trends and realistic evolutions are traced. In this paper <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> a range of objectives of existing topology and their limitation.

40|$|The recent {{string of}} major child sexual assault scandals, in Australia and other countries, {{can create a}} feeling of disgust and an urge to look away from an ugly reality. Yet we must confront and take {{collective}} responsibility for child protection by acknowledging that it happens every day and that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it. Societal silence on child sexual abuse protects perpetrators and enables abuse to continue. Child sexual assault {{is a lot more}} common than we may think. The Australian Institute of Family Studies reported in 2013 that as many as one in six boys and one in three girls has experienced sexual abuse. Most recently, the media reported sexual exploitation on a mass scale of an estimated 1, 400 children in Rotherdam, UK, between 1997 and 2013, and the failure of social services and the police to intervene appropriately. The Rotherdam report is full of examples of how children were groomed for eventual abuse in public view, receiving inappropriate gifts and attention from men...|$|E
40|$|The {{essay is}} a deep exegesis of a {{collection}} of poems by young authors from many different countries and various literary canons. The themes interwoven in these poems constitute a fabric with a changing weft, which invite us to reflect upon the relationship which the poetics of the journey, with its burden of experiences and imagination, of different cultures and emotions, establishes with time and history. The same places of our civilization, its figures and its words acquire different meanings: the ongoing journey carries a baggage of complex stories. It appears as if the same places, which throughout the centuries have hosted several paths and destinations, spoke the language of prophecy when the past and the present, seen with a swift glance, already talked about the enigma of the future. Ismael travelling through history, Ismael crossing the desert, Ismael with his Arab-Israeli identity, a refugee, a stranger, a dumb person – the languages surrounding him cannot become his languages – Ismael naked, who is afraid of love – in a civilization which mocks him is represetnative of the poetics of the journay. The poem remains suspended but the journey of Ismael beyond history and civilization goes on just like him, who drinks water from a source which is unable to quench his thirst. The exegesis of several other poems contextualises the journey in a peculiar post-modernity which retells the “great story” (the reference is to François Lyotard and to the debate surrounding him) between languages and multiple symbolical universes, literary suggestions and poetical experiences. After history comes the shame, the need to reset the time, to restart the journey, to come back home, to our origins. All around us, the landscapes have undergone a metamorphosis, like in the poem “Adriatic” by the Polish author Agnieszka Żądło-Jadczak: “Stones nestled in the hard skin, / burning with the sun, carving reliefs. // […] stones like drowned dreams” (cf. the cosmic inspiration in the poem “Before the after”, by Theodora Bauer, Austria). The poem by Michela Pusterla is a ballad whose rhythms are interrupted by broken metrics which are put together verse after verse through a sequence of enjambments. The great protagonists are: war (she is over), peace, the past, and a long silence in the deepest side of thought. Peace is a past which is falling silent. This deep silence after the grenades, the devastation, the exiles and the death itself wear history down. The protagonist comes back but everybody has already gone away: perhaps to other countries? Did they die? This strange return journey comes back to a history, which no longer exists. However, the dance begins here (the dance of rambling tales) under shattered skies with the tragedy in her heart. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> s very “poetics of journey”. This generation of young poets is undoubtedly one of those, which makes virtual or real journeys, more than other generations. However, the exegesis of their verses, though partial and selective, has shown that the journey is not the only element characterising their poems. In all poems, many references and fil rouges could be found. Apart from the aspects pointed out in this introduction, the reader could also find many other recurring themes and discover nothing else than a “culture” with its figures and its changing contexts, ready to be posed with different values in different frames and to compose a mosaic with reverberating colours. At the heart of this culture, the thought of the word “after” (it is no coincidence {{that this is one of}} the most recurring words in the current research on the paradigms of knowledge) has marked the authors’ inspiration. As if the “journey” did not exist without a “after-journey” and this “aftermath” in time could be always represented and lived as a “journey”: return, regret, salvation, bewilderment a memory, oblivion, after civilization, after history. The young poets who wrote this book, “travelling” from different parts of the world towards the ideal place of poetry, are like an emerald which absorbs reflected faces. The essay focuses primarily on the thematic element of the book, although the expressive force, which overwhelms the reader, cannot be underestimated. There is a lot of thinking in the book (after the journey the thought), which expresses itself with a riveting and emotional poetics, a prophetic answer to the enigma of time and its transcendence...|$|E

It became a very organic, long, many-rabbit-holes, never-stop-casting sort of film. There are certain things we captured just because we were living there. <b>We</b> knew film <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be a chorus, it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be a poem, it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be a butterfly, going from place to place.
