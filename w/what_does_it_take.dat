40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} {{on the ability}} of science to capture the true {{subjective}} experience of life, blinded within the limits of its reductionist approaches. With this approach, even though science can explain well the physics behind the objective phenomenon, it fails fundamentally in understanding the various aspects associated with the biological entities. In this sense, we are skeptical to the present approach of science and calls out for a more fundamental theory of life that considers not only the objectivity aspect of a biological entity but also the subjective experience as well. It raises questions as to <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to develop a new science from a subjective standpoint...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to work out technical requirements to reach nZEB level in Latvia and test them in real building project. Real energy consumption data and indoor climate conditions have been analysed to understand building energy performance after construction. At the moment no official low energy building guidelines exist how to reach very low energy standard in Latvia climate conditions.

What would be your role as a student, teacher, or administrator in such a change? How much modification of your understanding about the professional field is needed in order to ensure your success as a learner and/or educator? In light of the New Visions in Action initiative, teachers, researchers, administrators, and policy makers from North America and Europe discuss ways of connecting (trans-) national reform and individual classroom practice. Through their work, they demonstrate the many advantages of international collaboration for reaching national agendas and personal goals at the same time. Since the specific approach of this publication calls for an active reader, you will take the first step toward personal involvement in redefining how we teach and learn languages by picking up this book...|$|R

40|$|This {{fact sheet}} {{describes}} how the SJ 3 solar cell was invented, explains how the technology works, and why it won an R&D 100 Award. Based on NREL and Solar Junction technology, the commercial SJ 3 concentrator solar cell - with 43. 5 % conversion efficiency at 418 suns - uses a lattice-matched multijunction architecture that has near-term potential for cells with {approx} 50 % efficiency. Multijunction solar cells have higher conversion efficiencies than {{any other type of}} solar cell. But developers of utility-scale and space applications crave even better efficiencies at lower costs to be both cost-effective and able to meet the demand for power. The SJ 3 multijunction cell, developed by Solar Junction with assistance from foundational technological advances by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, has the highest efficiency to date - almost 2 % absolute more than the current industry standard multijunction cell-yet at a comparable cost. So <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> to create this cell having 43. 5 % efficiency at 418 -sun concentration?
