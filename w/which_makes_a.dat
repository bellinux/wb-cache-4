5|$|In 2000, Ford {{published}} a complete description of ankylosaurian osteoderms, {{in which he}} recognized the group Struthiosaurinae. Ford's description of Struthiosaurinae {{was based on the}} genus Struthiosaurus. Ford found that Struthiosaurus transylvanicus lacked any remains of the jugal, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> jugal scute unknown. The skull roof of T. transylvanicus is large and bulbous, preserving a large, flat scute on top, and no osteoderms behind the orbits. Another species, S. austriacus, is known from two incomplete skulls, which preserved irregular scutes parallel to the orbits along the cranium.|$|E
5|$|Large green-head ant colonies exhibit age caste polyethism, {{where the}} younger workers act as nurses {{and tend to}} the brood and the older workers go out and forage. In smaller colonies, age caste polyethism does not occur, with nursing and {{foraging}} initiated by both younger and older workers. These results show that ageing is not the mechanism that drives labour among colonies. The emergence of age polyethism in larger colonies {{is a result of}} worker specialisation. Workers in small colonies usually tend to the brood much more than those in larger colonies, but {{this is due to the}} differentiated social environment between small and large societies. In contrast, old workers from large colonies forage for significant periods of time, and those in small colonies forage less. A predatory species such as the green-head ant may not be able to increase prey retrieval within its environment, even if there is a larger foraging force. This means that the workers may have to spend more time foraging to retrieve any prey item. Contact among nestmates also differs between small and large colonies, strongly suggesting that colony size regulates contact rates. Higher contact rates allow colonies to scan their environment and determine their needs more quickly, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> colony react faster. Task allocation patterns (referring to the way that tasks are chosen) are different in small and large colonies, which may determine the contact rate.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the summer {{roosting}} locations of this species, as well as where maternal colonies are formed, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> proper species distribution estimate difficult to obtain. The first study into the summer roosting habits was only done in 2011 so information is scarce. This study performed by Johnson, Kiser and Peterson discovered that these bats most commonly use ground level rock roosts in talus slopes, rock fields and vertical cliff faces for their summer roosts. On average they change their roosts every 1.1 days, males travel about 41 meters between consecutive roosts and females around 67 meters. They also found that females roosting sites were closer to ephemeral water sources than male’s roosts. Females who have young require roost sites that receive a lot of sunlight in order to keep the pups warm while the mother is away from the nesting site. Summer roosting habitats are very difficult to find, and may be threatened by mining, quarrying, oil and gas drilling and other mineral extraction, as well as logging, sprawl highway construction, wind energy and other forms of agricultural, industrial and residential development. However, it is also likely that some of the above disturbances could also create roosting sites for the species.|$|E

25|$|Convex-concave (meniscus) lenses can {{be either}} {{positive}} or negative, depending on the relative curvatures of the two surfaces. A negative meniscus lens has a steeper concave surface and is thinner at the centre than at the periphery. Conversely, a positive meniscus lens has a steeper convex surface and is thicker at the centre than at the periphery. An ideal thin lens with two surfaces of equal curvature would have zero optical power, meaning that it would neither converge nor diverge light. All real lenses have nonzero thickness, however, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> real lens with identical curved surfaces slightly positive. To obtain exactly zero optical power, a meniscus lens must have slightly unequal curvatures {{to account for the}} effect of the lens' thickness.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} process start with mother rolls. First, the etched, roughened and pre-formed anode foil {{on the mother}} roll {{as well as the}} spacer paper and the cathode foil are cut to the required width. The foils are fed to an automatic winder, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> wound section in a consecutive operation involving three sequential steps: terminal welding, winding, and length cutting. In the next production step the wound section fixed at the lead out terminals is soaked with electrolyte under vacuum impregnation. The impregnated winding is then built into an aluminum case, provided with a rubber sealing disc, and mechanically tightly sealed by curling. Thereafter, the capacitor is provided with an insulating shrink sleeve film. This optically ready capacitor is then contacted at rated voltage in a high temperature post-forming device for healing all the dielectric defects resulting from the cutting and winding procedure. After post-forming, a 100% final measurement of capacitance, leakage current, and impedance takes place. Taping closes the manufacturing process; the capacitors are ready for delivery.|$|E

Positive displacement types such as piston compressors, or rotary types such as a Roots blower could also be used with suitable provisions for damping the pulsations in the air flow (however, other rotary types such as twin screw compressors are capable of providing a steady supply of compressed fluid). The pressure ratio of a single fan blade is too low and cannot be used.|$|E
