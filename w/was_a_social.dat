5|$|The Social Hall, {{also known}} as the Officers' Club, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> club located on the northwestern side of the island. Located in {{proximity}} to the Power House, water tower and Former Military Chapel (Bachelor Quarters), it formerly housed the post exchange. The club <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> venue for the Federal Penitentiary workers and their families on the island to unwind after a hard week's work dealing with America's most hardened criminals after they'd been locked up at 17:30. It was burned down by Native Americans during the Occupation of Alcatraz in 1970, leaving a shell which still remains.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{scientific}} work, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> {{activist who}} {{was critical of}} what he {{considered to be an}} unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, The Malay Archipelago, was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never been out of print.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} the {{estimated}} bite force at the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for the body mass, found that for placental mammals the bite force at the canines (in newtons/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in the dire wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African hunting dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the dingo (108). The bite force at the carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator's largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits. The morphology of the dire wolf {{was similar to that}} of its living relatives, and assuming that the dire wolf <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> hunter, then its high bite force relative to living canids suggests that it preyed on relatively large animals. The bite force rating of the bone-consuming spotted hyena (117) challenged the common assumption that high bite force in the canines and the carnassials was necessary to consume bone.|$|E
5|$|After the United Kingdom's {{entry into}} World War I in 1914, Wheeler {{volunteered for the}} armed forces. Although preferring solitary to group activities, Wheeler found that he greatly enjoyed soldiering. For the next seven months, he was posted as an {{instructor}} in the University of London Officer Training Corps. It was during this period, in January 1915, that a son was born to the Wheelers, and named Michael. Michael was their only child, something that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> anomaly at the time, although it is unknown if this was by choice or not. In May 1915, Wheeler transferred to the Royal Field Artillery (Territorial Force) and shortly thereafter was appointed captain. In this position he was stationed at various bases across Britain, often bringing {{his wife and child}} with him; his responsibility was as a battery commander, initially of field guns and later of howitzers.|$|E

Banfield noticed her granddaughter's passion for the performing arts and enrolled her in piano, tap dance, and ballet lessons. She has a younger brother, actor/writer Caleeb Pinkett.|$|E
5|$|The {{magazine}} {{was produced by}} the English printers Hazell, Watson and Viney. One of its owners, Walter Hazell, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> reformer and supporter of women's suffrage. A successful firm, Hazell, Watson and Viney also produced the Woman's Signal and the Woman's Gazette, which featured female political and economic topics. The success of The Lady's Realm allowed it to remain published for eighteen years, from 1896 to 1915, much longer than many other contemporary women's periodicals. Thirty-six volumes were produced, from November 1896 to October 1914 (a final volume may have been released in 1915). It is not known why it ended, though Versteeg and her colleagues speculate that World War I {{may have been a}} cause, as was the case for other contemporary publications like Young Woman (1891–1914) and The Girl’s Realm (1892–1915).|$|E
5|$|Constantin von Tischendorf, {{who worked}} with {{numerous}} Bible manuscripts, was known as somewhat flamboyant, and had ambitiously sought money from several royal families for his ventures, who had indeed funded his trips. Simonides, whose name may be a synonym mocking Tischendorf, had a somewhat obscure history, as he claimed he was at Mt. Athos in the years preceding Tischendorf's contact, making the claim at least plausible. Simonides also claimed his father had died and the invitation to Mt. Athos came from his uncle, a monk there, but subsequent letters to his father were found among his possessions at his death. While the word 'forgery' has been bandied about among scholars regarding the claims on the Sinaiticus by Tischendorf, perhaps a more accurate rendering would be recollation and 'adjusted' restoration as Simonides, an expert on hieroglyphics which are represented throughout the Sinaiticus. Simonides claimed the false nature of the document in The Guardian in an exchange of letters among scholars and others, at the time. Henry Bradshaw, a British librarian known to both men, defended the Tischendorf find of the Sinaiticus, casting aside the accusations of Simonides. Since Bradshaw <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> 'hub' among many diverse scholars of the day, his aiding of Tischendorf was given much weight. Simonides died shortly after, and the issue lay dormant for many years.|$|E
