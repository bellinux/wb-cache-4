2500|$|In a September 2006 {{edition of}} the ABC News program Nightline, Parker {{expressed}} his views on religion, stating that he believes in [...] "a God" [...] and that [...] "there is knowledge that humanity does not yet possess" [...] while cautioning {{that it would take}} a long time to explain exactly what he meant by his belief in God. Parker believes all religions are [...] "silly". He states that [...] "All the religions are superfunny to me… The story of Jesus makes no sense to me. God sent his only son. <b>Why</b> <b>could</b> God only have one son and why would he have to die? It's just bad writing, really. And it's really terrible in about the second act." [...] Parker further remarked, Basically… out of all the ridiculous religion stories which are greatly, wonderfully ridiculous—the silliest one I've ever heard is, 'Yeah… there's this big giant universe and it's expanding, it's all gonna collapse on itself and we're all just here just 'cause… just cause. That, to me, is the most ridiculous explanation ever.|$|E
2500|$|Raymond Padilla from GameSpy also {{praised the}} game's visual which {{resulted}} in appealing character designs. The change of several designs in Final Fantasy X-2 resulted in mixed reactions with GameSpot criticizing [...] "a dominantly lighthearted tone" [...] in comparison to Final Fantasy X darker atmosphere, while IGN praised the clothing designs, combining [...] "proven and recognizable Final Fantasy styles" [...] with a [...] "revealing neo-modern fashion sense". The voice casting was praised by Game Revolution who noted {{most of them were}} [...] "above average". Bramwell was more critical owing to the lack lipsynching and unsuitable tones that made him wonder <b>why</b> <b>could</b> not the gamers listen to the original Japanese audio. Criticism to the English acting in Final Fantasy X was aimed towards James Arnold Taylor's and Hedy Burress's portrayal of Tidus and Yuna, respectively, in comparison to the original Japanese delivery which made the characters less interesting. The English release of Final Fantasy X-2 won the Seventh Annual Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences award in 2004 for Outstanding Achievement in Character Performance in recognition of the character Rikku.|$|E

60|$|They {{continued}} {{without saying}} any more, walking along opposite horizons, {{hand in hand}} across the intervening space, two separate people.
