5|$|The {{following}} day, June 28, Union and Confederate soldiers clashed again {{near the}} Golding house. Jones {{suspected that the}} Federals near the house were withdrawing, and authorized Toombs to perform a reconnaissance-in-force to ascertain whether this <b>was</b> <b>true.</b> However, Toombs turned the reconnaissance operation into a full engagement and advanced with some of Anderson's men. Before he could be countermanded, the Confederates had already been repulsed by the VI Corps.|$|E
5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, the Doctor {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: The Doctor is indeed the Voyager EMH, but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck. The crew is trying to extricate his program so he only needs to wait it out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests, it will prematurely end {{the program and the}} Doctor will be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, the Doctor finally opts to believe in his holographic existence. The simulation ends and the Doctor finds himself on the holodeck; Chakotay's story <b>was</b> <b>true</b> and the Doctor is safely returned to sickbay.|$|E
5|$|Fall of Cybertron {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. Critics generally {{felt that the}} game <b>was</b> <b>true</b> to the Transformers franchise and provided good fan service, but some thought that the story pace slowed at times. Gameplay was mostly praised, but some reviewers cited the removal of War for Cybertrons cooperative campaign as a low point. Graphics and audio also received broadly positive comments, though some reviewers noticed frame rate issues with the PlayStation 3 version. A tie-in titled , which is partially set between War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron was released June 24, 2014.|$|E

5|$|Gerard Libaridyan, an {{historian}} and close adviser of Ter-Petrosyan, collected and presented {{the evidence against}} the defendants. He later stated {{in an interview that}} he was unsure if the evidence <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> inviting the notion that the party was banned because of its increasing chances of winning seats in the July 1995 parliamentary elections. Several months after the elections, most of the men were found not guilty with the exception of several defendants charged for engaging in corrupt business practices. The ban on the party was lifted, however, less than a week after Ter-Petrosyan fell from power in February 1998 and was replaced by Robert Kocharyan, who was backed by the Dashnaks.|$|E
5|$|He adopted {{his crew}} cut hair style while {{serving in the}} United States Marine Corps. Carey has had {{refractive}} surgery to correct his vision and therefore did not really require glasses (any glasses he wore in public were merely props to help the audience recognize him). However, while this <b>was</b> <b>true</b> for several years, on the May 17, 2006, episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! he revealed that when he turned 40, he actually developed a need for bifocals. As of 2007, Carey resides in Los Angeles and New York City.|$|E
5|$|In June 1963, Kenyatta {{met with}} the Tanganyikan President Julius Nyerere and Ugandan President Milton Obote in Nairobi.

Privately, Kenyatta was more reluctant regarding the arrangement and as 1964 came around the federation had not come to pass. In May 1964, Kenyatta rejected a back-benchers resolution calling for speedier federation. He publicly stated that talk of a federation had always been a ruse to hasten the pace of Kenyan independence from Britain, but Nyerere denied that this <b>was</b> <b>true.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A {{language}} is called fully interpreted, if meanings {{are attached to}} its sentences so that they all <b>are</b> either <b>true</b> or false, and the following rules are valid when A and B denote its sentences (iff stands for if and only if): A <b>is</b> <b>true</b> iff ¬A <b>is</b> false, and A is false iff ¬A is true; A ∨ B <b>is</b> <b>true</b> iff A or B <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> and false iff A and B are false; A ∧ B <b>is</b> <b>true</b> iff A and B <b>are</b> <b>true,</b> and false if A or B is false; A ↦ B <b>is</b> <b>true</b> iff A <b>is</b> false or B <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> and false iff A <b>is</b> <b>true</b> and B <b>is</b> false; A ↔ B <b>is</b> <b>true</b> iff A and B <b>are</b> both <b>true</b> false or both false, and false iff A <b>is</b> <b>true</b> and B <b>is</b> false or A is false and B <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> If P(x) <b>is</b> a formula and X {{is a set of}} terms, then P is called a predicate with domain X if P(x) is a sentence for each assignment of a term of X into x (shortly, for each x ∈ X), and if ∃ x P(x) and ∀ x P(x) exist and satisfy the following rules: ∀ x P(x) <b>is</b> <b>true</b> iff P(x) <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for every x ∈ X, and false iff P(x) is false for some x ∈ X; ∃ x P(x) <b>is</b> <b>true</b> iff P(x) <b>is</b> <b>true</b> for some x ∈ X, and false iff P(x) is false for all x ∈ X.|$|R
5000|$|One {{consequence}} of Stalnaker's {{acceptance of the}} Uniqueness Assumption is that, if the law of excluded middle <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> then all instances of the formula (A > C) ∨ (A > ¬C) <b>are</b> <b>true.</b> The law of excluded middle is the thesis that for all propositions p, p ∨ ¬p <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> If the Uniqueness Assumption <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> then for every antecedent A, there is a uniquely closest world where A <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> If the law of excluded middle <b>is</b> <b>true,</b> any consequent C <b>is</b> either <b>true</b> or false at that world where A <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> So for every counterfactual A > C, either A > C or A > ¬C <b>is</b> <b>true.</b> This <b>is</b> called conditional excluded middle (CEM).

5|$|Little of this <b>was</b> <b>true,</b> but at {{the time}} the British {{had no way of knowing}} this. The files of the Admiralstab in Berlin show that he was {{approached}} by N, rather than volunteering for intelligence service, entered their employment as early as May 1914 (rather than in August as he claimed), received regular pay rather than being unpaid, and intended to return to Berlin on completing his mission. It is unknown whether he really had any intention of going to the US, and there is no indication from the Admiralstab files that he had been asked to keep his controller's name a secret. After hearing Lody's evidence the court martial was adjourned until the following Monday.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{original}} deployment plans for Zeus had been a defensive system for SAC. The Air Force argued against such a system, in favor of building more ICBMs of their own. Their logic was that every Soviet missile launched in a counterforce strike could destroy a single US missile. If both forces had similar numbers of missiles, such an attack would leave both forces with few remaining missiles to launch a counterstrike. Adding Zeus would {{reduce the number of}} losses on the US side, helping ensure a counterstrike force would survive. However, the same <b>was</b> <b>true</b> if the US built more ICBMs instead. The Air Force was far more interested in building its own missiles than the Army's, {{especially in the case of}} Zeus, which appeared to be easily outwitted.|$|E

These were all stamped and coded, loaded into ships to be taken to Quebec and then by rail {{to the site of the}} bridge for assembly.

5|$|Though the location, plan of attack, {{and timing}} were {{determined}} by Hitler, he blamed the defeat on his General Staff. Unlike Stalin, who gave his commanding generals the liberty to make important command decisions, Hitler's interference in German military matters progressively increased while {{his attention to the}} political aspects of the war decreased. The opposite <b>was</b> <b>true</b> for Stalin; throughout the Kursk campaign, he trusted the judgment of his commanders, and as their decisions led to battlefield success it increased his trust in their military judgment. Stalin stepped back from operational planning, only rarely overruling military decisions, resulting in the Red Army gaining more freedom of action {{during the course of the}} war.|$|E
