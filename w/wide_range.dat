5|$|Biotechnology in {{the general}} sense has been an {{important}} part of biology since the late 19th century. With the industrialization of brewing and agriculture, chemists and biologists became aware of the great potential of human-controlled biological processes. In particular, fermentation proved a great boon to chemical industries. By the early 1970s, a <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> of biotechnologies were being developed, from drugs like penicillin and steroids to foods like Chlorella and single-cell protein to gasohol—as well as a <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> of hybrid high-yield crops and agricultural technologies, the basis for the Green Revolution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In {{dealing with}} the {{production}} of various products in some industries, many firms need to respond to <b>wide</b> <b>ranges</b> of quantities demanded. High responsiveness to <b>wider</b> <b>ranges</b> of quantities can be a competitive advantage for a firm in modern highly competing environments. To stay ahead of competitors, a firm {{should be able to}} schedule production in an efficient way. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effects of <b>wide</b> <b>ranges</b> of quantities demanded on the scheduling. The production scheduling problem of knitted fabrics is used to examine the influences. Genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to be the analytical tool. Optimal parameters including mutation rates and crossover rates that generate good performance are obtained experimentally. Results from this paper show that the makespan in <b>wide</b> <b>ranges</b> of quantities is lower than that in a small range. However, the machine utilization in <b>wide</b> <b>ranges</b> of quantities is lower than that in a small range. To schedule the production with a lower makespan and with reasonable machine utilization, one can divide a big customer order into many manufacturing orders with smaller quantities. In addition, the on-time delivery rate can be increased by adding a penalty factor of completion time of a job.
