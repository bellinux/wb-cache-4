50|$|The lake {{is known}} for the large <b>wels</b> <b>catfishes.</b> It is {{believed}} that {{the depths of the}} lake are inhabited by the gigantic catfishes, up to 3 m long with the weight of over 100 kg. Such a large specimens have not been caught yet and in July 2017 a divers were employed to explore the part of the lake. The waters of the lake are murky and at the depths of 5 to 6 m, the visibility is zero. The divers reached 15 m, but didn't discover such a large fishes, though few days before the dive, a specimen 1.86 m long which weighted 37 kg have been caught near the mouth of the Boranja river. Since 1998, an annual catfish hunt festivity Somovijada, has been held. The heaviest fish caught in the lake measured 87 kg.|$|E

25|$|The <b>wels</b> <b>catfish</b> {{lives in}} large, warm lakes and deep, slow-flowing rivers. It prefers {{to remain in}} {{sheltered}} locations such as holes in the riverbed, sunken trees, etc. It consumes its food in the open water or in the deep, {{where it can be}} recognized by its large mouth. <b>Wels</b> <b>catfish</b> are kept in fish ponds as food fish.|$|R

25|$|There are {{concerns}} about the ecological impact of introducing the <b>wels</b> <b>catfish</b> to non-native regions. These concerns {{take into account the}} situation in Lake Victoria in Africa, where Nile perch were introduced and rapidly caused the extinction of numerous indigenous species. This severely impacted the entire lake, destroying much of the original ecosystem. The introduction of foreign species is almost always a burden on the affected ecosystem. Following the introduction of <b>wels</b> <b>catfish,</b> some fishes' numbers are in clear and rapid decline. Since its introduction in the Mequinenza Reservoir in 1974, it has spread {{to other parts of the}} Ebro basin, including its tributaries, especially the Segre River. Some endemic species of Iberian barbels, genus Barbus in the Cyprinidae, were once abundant especially in the Ebro river but due to competition from and predation by <b>wels</b> <b>catfish</b> have since disappeared in the middle channel Ebro. The ecology of the river has also changed, as there is now a major growth in aquatic vegetation such as algae. Barbel species from mountain stream tributaries of the Ebro that <b>wels</b> <b>catfish</b> have not colonized are not affected.|$|R

50|$|The zebra mussel, an {{invasive}} species, {{is expanding}} upstream in Ebro waters.
