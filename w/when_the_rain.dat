5|$|Rain {{prevented}} {{play after}} 3pm {{on the second}} day. No one scored more than 40 as Glamorgan elected to bat and made 197, with the four Australian bowlers, Lindwall, Miller, Johnson and Ring sharing the wickets. The Australians' 215/3 {{was based on an}} aggressive 84 from Miller, with five sixes and seven fours, and a partnership of 126 with stand-in Hassett, who was 71 not out <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> came.

Vettel took sixth position from Michael Schumacher which proved sufficient to retain the title even with Alonso finishing second.|$|E

Brian Statham 3/35, Doug Wright 4/39 and Roy Tattersall 3/11 made short work of the Country XI, who were out for 97. The MCC reached 60/0 with Hutton 40 not out <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> came down and the match was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Generally, wasps {{are unable}} to predict heavy rainfalls. They {{continue}} their foraging activities even in the rain, but cease <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> becomes torrential.

Those whose foraging activities were interrupted by heavy rainfall become reluctant to forage again in the future even {{when the weather is}} dry and calm. Those who continue to forage do so mainly for fluid.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, Townsend bowled on {{a sticky}} wicket at Lord's {{to win the}} opening match against Middlesex, and, though on the hard pitches his bowling was largely harmless, his skill as a batsman reached far beyond that of {{previous}} years and he hit five centuries - the highest being 159 against Lancashire. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> returned in August, he lost his batting, but his bowling was - remarkably - even more irresistible than in 1895. Across five matches he bowled 1,533 balls with 65 maidens, taking 64 wickets for 715 runs and a bowling average of 11.17 runs per wicket.|$|E

25|$|In , ABC aired 11 Monday night {{games and}} one Sunday {{afternoon}} game. Game 1 of the 1982 NLCS {{had to be}} played twice. In the first attempt (on October 6), the Atlanta Braves led against the St. Louis Cardinals 1–0 behind Phil Niekro. The game was three outs away becoming official when the umpire stopped it. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> did not subside, the game was canceled. Game 1 began from the start the following night in a pitching match-up of Pascual Pérez for the Braves and longtime Cardinal starter Bob Forsch. Howard Cosell did not broadcast Game 2 of the 1982 NLCS (alongside Al Michaels and Tommy Lasorda) because of his commitment of hosting the Pittsburgh Steelers' 50th Anniversary dinner in Pittsburgh on October 9, 1982, which was broadcast live on Pittsburgh's ABC affiliate, WTAE-TV and Pittsburgh's NBC affiliate, WPXI-TV. ABC's Jim Lampley interviewed the winners in the Cardinals' clubhouse after clinching the National League pennant in Game 3.|$|E
25|$|Travelling {{north to}} Brisbane the {{tourists}} found a storm brewing {{and the weather}} cool, but heavy. Peter May won the toss and chose to bat on a green wicket, but only three overs were played before the rain came. When they resumed the opener Willie Watson was caught by Wally Grout off the Queensland captain Ray Lindwall, who swung the ball at his pleasure in the heavy atmosphere, taking 5/57 as England collapsed to 39/4. Raman Subba Row (51) and Trevor Bailey (33) rescued the innings, but the leg-spinner Wal Walmsley (2/34) bowled Subba Row and Ken Mackay (3/4) removed Roy Swetman and Frank Tyson and the MCC were out for 151. Queensland were 30/1 overnight and batted poorly the next day, making only 105 runs in a full day's play as John Mortimore took 21-8-26-0 in the day, Jim Laker 12-3-19-1 and Trevor Bailey 21-8-28-1. No wonder crowds flocked to see Norm O'Neill's attacking strokeplay. On the last day Queensland {{made an effort to}} make more runs, but still took 501 minutes to make 210 with Statham taking 3/43 and Laker 4/27, but Mortimore was hit for 38 runs off his last 8 overs without a wicket and Ron Archer top scored with 83. The ball broke Raman Subba Row's wrist when fielding, another injury that removed him from contention just after he had made three fifties in three games. The MCC collapsed again to 41/4 as Lindwall (2/16) removed both openers and Walmsley (2/25) the out of form Colin Cowdrey and Trevor Bailey. Peter May and Roy Swetman added 30 unbeaten runs <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> returned to finish the game.|$|E

Jos Verstappen scored points {{for the first time}} since the 1996 Argentine Grand Prix. Verstappen said that was pleased with the result and praised his team for switching to wet tyres as he kept in contact with his mechanics. Trulli remarked that he had [...] "never had to work so hard for one point" [...] after the amount of pressure he came under in the race. Coulthard said that he lost the chance of victory when he stalled his car and admitted it was his mistake. On the other hand, he criticised his penalty as Coulthard believed that the race stewards should have been given more freedom by Formula One's governing body, the FIA, to decide whether a driver gained an advantage. David Tremayne of The Independent noted had Coulthard raised his hand before the start, he might have started from the back of the grid. After the race, Villeneuve and Diniz were penalised 25 seconds–which were added to their total race times–for their collisions with Diniz and de la Rosa respectively.|$|E

[...] Subsequently, a personal message left by Carey is shown, reading [...] "After every storm, if you look hard enough, a rainbow appears..." [...] Five testimonials from fans are shown, each telling of their own personal problems and hardships. In her testimonial, the third girl says [...] "I am fourteen years old, I'm a high school student, there is not one day that goes by that people don't make fun of me about my race. Its is about self-confidence, don't be afraid to dream." [...] After the last girl reads her message, Carey is shown lying on a sofa in her living room, watching a television. As she sadly sings, she watched as different empowering messages and events are shown on the screen. Of them, one shows Lance Armstrong riding a bicycle on the Tour de France, reading [...] "Lance Armstrong overcame cancer and won the Tour de France in 1999." [...] After the next scene, Carey is shown sitting on the sofa, with tears in her eyes, as they slowly escape her. During the end of the bridge, where she sings, [...] "Certainly the Lord will guide me," [...] Carey stands from the floor, and exits onto a large balcony overlooking the city. Rain begins to fall while Carey waves her arms as she cries out. Her depression is resolved <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> stops and a rainbow forms, prompting her to smile.|$|E
500|$|Jean {{initially}} makes progress, and earns a small {{profit from}} his rabbit farm. In the long run, getting water proves a problem, and dragging {{it all the}} way from the distant spring becomes a backbreaking experience. Jean asks to borrow Ugolin's mule, but is met only with vague excuses. Then, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> does come, it falls on the surrounding area but not where it is needed. Jean loudly berates God, whom he thinks has already given him enough trouble by deforming him. Later, the dusty winds of the sirocco also arrive, bringing the farm to near-catastrophe. Jean is undeterred, and decides to dig a well. At this point Ugolin sees it fitting to try and convince Jean that his project is hopeless, and that he might be better off selling. Jean asks how much he could expect to receive for the farm, and Ugolin gives an estimate of around 8,000 francs. Jean has no intention of leaving though, but wants to use the value of the property to take up a mortgage of half that sum. Ugolin is not happy, but Papet again sees opportunity: he will himself grant the mortgage; that way he will either earn the interest, or drive Jean away for good. From the money Jean buys dynamite to finish the well, but in his first blast is hit by a flying rock and falls into the cavity. At first the injuries seem minor, but it turns out his spine is fractured and when the doctor arrives he declares Jean dead. Ugolin returns with the news to Papet, who asks him why he's crying. [...] "It is not me who's crying," [...] he responds, [...] "it's my eyes".|$|E

2500|$|During May, June and July 1896, {{when the}} weather was {{consistently}} dry, Townsend proved extremely ineffective. Though <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> came he took 38 wickets {{in the last four}} matches, it was clear he was an easy bowler to play on firm pitches. The following year, Townsend's bowling was expensive even on the few rain-affected pitches because he was sacrificing accuracy to gain spin, but his batting developed so much that he attained the status of an all-rounder, scoring a maiden century against Yorkshire and winning a critical match against Nottinghamshire.|$|E

[...] Lawry's Australians won the first test at Old Trafford but were rolled for 78 at Lord's where Milburn scored a rollicking 83. [...] Wintry conditions – the ground was white with hail {{on the first day}} – allowed the Australians to escape.

In the final half hour of the Test Norman Yardley and Godfrey Evans batted on when Australia wanted three wickets for their third victory of the series [...] "even though the light was atrocious and rain was falling heavily". Hammond had been {{dismissed}} earlier, but refused to let his team appeal against the light, either to make a point about the Barnes appeal or simply due to sportsmanship. Bill O'Reilly said [...] "I could not understand why the English batsman seemed loath to appeal against the weather, even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> was coming down solidly. There are no praises for gallant gestures in Tests matches". In the Fifth Test the new England captain Norman Yardley appealed [...] against the light in a low scoring match where every run was vital. He had his appeal turned down and he and Jack Ikin lost their wickets in light so bad that the Australian cameramen were unable to take clear photographs. They were carrying light meters (not available to umpires for nearly 40 years) and stated that the light was much worse than when Barnes and Johnson were allowed off the field.|$|E
2500|$|The Beatles, who {{incorporated}} {{the techniques of}} concrète into their recordings, were responsible for popularizing the concept of backmasking. Singer John Lennon and producer George Martin both claimed they discovered the backward recording technique during the recording of 1966's Revolver; specifically the album tracks [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] and [...] "I'm Only Sleeping", and the single [...] "Rain". Lennon stated that, while {{under the influence of}} marijuana, he accidentally played the tapes for [...] "Rain" [...] in reverse and enjoyed the sound. The following day he shared the results with the other Beatles, and the effect was used first in the guitar solo for [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] and later in the coda of [...] "Rain". According to Martin, the band had been experimenting with changing the speeds of and reversing the [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] tapes, and Martin got the idea of reversing Lennon's vocals and guitar, which he did with a clip from [...] "Rain". Lennon then liked the effect and kept it. Regardless, [...] "Rain" [...] was the first song to feature a backmasked message: [...] "Sunshine... Rain... <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> comes, they run and hide their heads" [...] ( [...] ; the last line is the reversed first verse of the song).|$|E
2500|$|Hancock's {{assault was}} {{scheduled}} to commence at 4 a.m., {{but it was still}} pitch black and he delayed until 4:35, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> stopped and was replaced by a thick mist. The attack crashed through the Confederate works, virtually destroying Jones's Brigade, now commanded by Col. William Witcher. As Barlow's division swung around to the eastern tip of the Mule Shoe, it overran the brigade commanded by Brig. Gen. George [...] "Maryland" [...] Steuart, capturing both Steuart and his division commander, Allegheny Johnson. On Barlow's right, Brig. Gen. David B. Birney's division met stronger resistance from the brigades of Col. William Monaghan and Brig. Gen. James A. Walker (the Stonewall Brigade). The recent rain had ruined much of the Confederates' gunpowder, but they fought fiercely hand to hand. The Union troops continued to spread south along {{the western edge of the}} Mule Shoe. Despite the initial success at obliterating much of the Mule Shoe salient, there was a flaw in the Union plan—no one had considered how to capitalize on the breakthrough. The 15,000 infantrymen of Hancock's II Corps had crowded into a narrow front about a half mile wide and soon lost all unit cohesion, becoming little more than an armed mob.|$|E
