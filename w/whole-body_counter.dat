The Lavizan Center had imported a <b>whole-body</b> <b>counter</b> (WBC), a device used to identify and measure the radioactive material {{in the body of}} human beings and animals. On 29 June 2004, El Baradei said that Iran had accepted that the alleged concealed nuclear site in Tehran was a military-research complex before it was razed. The Iranian authorities stated that this was a physics institute later on turned to be a biotechnology research and development center.|$|E
40|$|<b>Whole-body</b> <b>counters,</b> {{the first}} {{constructed}} some years ago, were developed orignal 1 y to measure radioactivity ingested or inhaled accidentally by radiation workers At a relatively early stage, it became conventional {{to house the}} detectors (and subject to be examined) in a complete room with walls, floor and ceiling of lead (some 10 cm thickness) or steel (usually about 15 cm thickness) {{in order to reduce}} the background counting rate. The potential usefulness of these devjces in medicine was quickly appreciated 2. lk,wever, their widespread application to patients was probably retarded by the cost and weight of the equipment in relation to the hospital environment and by the remoteness of major nuclear centres, in which most counters were established initially, from centres of population. More recently, simpler and che 9 er designs of whole-body countr 6 have evolved for clinical use, as reviewed elsewhere. Our own <b>whole-body</b> <b>counters</b> have a high clinical utilization but this situation i 5 not common to all groups of workers.

40|$|<b>Whole-body</b> <b>counters</b> (WBCs) {{are special}} {{instruments}} for measuring internal irradiation doses {{and are usually}} housed within or around nuclear facilities {{in the event of}} unexpected radiation emergencies. As a substantial proportion of total body potassium (TBK) is found in fat-free mass (FFM), FFM volume can be predicted from WBC-measured 40 K. We screened TBK in Japanese healthy young adults using a WBC and found strong linear correlations between TBK and lean body mass (LBM) and body mass index (r = 0. 97, P[*]<[*] 0. 01 and r = 0. 47, P[*]<[*] 0. 01, respectively). Multiple linear regression analysis, following adjustments for sex, indicates that only LBM has a significant correlation with TBK (P[*]<[*] 0. 01). These results strongly support the feasibility of using WBCs for estimating FF...|$|R
40|$|Whole-body {{counting}} is {{a technique}} of choice for assessing the intake of gamma-emitting radionuclides. An appropriate calibration is necessary, which is done either by experimental measurement or by Monte Carlo (MC) calculation. The aim of this work was to validate a MC model for calibrating <b>whole-body</b> <b>counters</b> (WBCs) {{by comparing the results}} of computations with measurements performed on an anthropomorphic phantom and to investigate the effect of a change in phantom's position on the WBC counting sensitivity. GEANT MC code was used for the calculations, and an IGOR phantom loaded with several types of radionuclides was used for the experimental measurements. The results show a reasonable agreement between measurements and MC computation. A 1 -cm error in phantom positioning changes the activity estimation by > 2 %. Considering that a 5 -cm deviation of the positioning of the phantom may occur in a realistic counting scenario, this implies that the uncertainty of the activity measured by a WBC is ∼ 10 - 20...|$|R
50|$|Patients may {{be given}} {{instructions}} to fast prior to capsule administration; {{it should be noted}} that there is significant variation in clinical practice in this regard. The effective dose of radiation for an adult given 370 kBq of SeHCAT is 0.26 mSv. (For comparison, the radiation exposure from an abdominal CT scan is quoted at 5.3 mSv and annual background exposure in the UK 1-3 mSv.) Measurements were originally performed with a <b>whole-body</b> <b>counter</b> but are usually performed now with an uncollimated gamma camera. The patient is scanned supine or prone with anterior and posterior acquisition from head to thigh 1 to 3 hours after taking the capsule. Scanning is repeated after 7 days. Background values are subtracted and care must be taken to avoid external sources of radiation in a nuclear medicine department.|$|E
40|$|To {{obtain an}} {{assessment}} of the committed effective dose, individual monitoring for the estimation of intakes of radionuclides is required. For individual monitoring of exposure to intakes of radionuclides, direct measurement of radionuclides in the body - in vivo counting- is very useful. To advance in a precision in vivo counting which fulfills the requirements of ICRP 1990 recommendations, some problems, such as the investigation of uncertainties in estimates of body burdens by in vivo counting, and the selection of the way to improve the precision, have been studied. In the present study, a calibration technique for in vivo counting application using Monte Carlo simulation was developed. The advantage of the technique is that counting efficiency can be obtained for various shapes and sizes that are very difficult to change for phantoms. To validate the calibration technique, the response functions and counting efficiencies of a <b>whole-body</b> <b>counter</b> installed in JAERI were evaluated using the simulation and measurements. Consequently, the calculations are in good agreement with the measurements. The method for the determination of counting efficiency curves as a function of energy was developed using the present technique and a physiques correction equation was derived from the relationship between parameters of correction factor and counting efficiencies of the JAERI <b>whole-body</b> <b>counter.</b> The uncertainties in body burdens of sup 1 sup 3 sup 7 Cs estimated with the JAERI <b>whole-body</b> <b>counter</b> were also investigated using the Monte Carlo simulation and measurements. It was found that the uncertainties of body burdens estimated with the <b>whole-body</b> <b>counter</b> are strongly dependent on various sources of uncertainty such as radioactivity distribution within the body and counting statistics. Furthermore, the evaluation method of the peak efficiencies of a Ge semi-conductor detector was developed by Monte Carlo simulation for optimum arrangement of Ge semi-conductor detector...|$|E

40|$|Many {{radiation}} detection programs use bio-assays, <b>whole-body</b> <b>counters,</b> or air sampling to estimate internal doses. This study examines {{the possibility of}} using a common external thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) badge as a device for detecting inhaled radionuclides through radiation those radionuclides emit which escape the body. The three common radionuclides chosen for modeling due to their varying decay modes and use or production in the nuclear industry were Cs- 137, U- 238, and Sr- 90. These three radionuclides were modeled for biological and radiological removal in the dynamic systems modeling program of STELLA II and modeled for TLD dose per organ in the geometry and radiation simulation program of MCNP. The results show that none of the nuclides in the study can be detected at air concentrations below regulatory limits for acute inhalation exposures. To achieve a detectable dose from an 8 -hour work exposure, with a 90 -day wait until the TLD is read, the airborne concentrations for the inhalation classes that produced the most dose per Bq would be 37. 9 kBq/m 3, 146 MBq/m 3, and 1. 67 MBq/m 3 for Cs- 137, U- 238, and Sr- 90, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{accidents}} {{that occurred}} at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant after the Great East Japan Earthquake on 11 March 2011 have resulted in long-term, ongoing anxiety among the residents of Fukushima, Japan. Soon after the disaster, Fukushima Prefecture launched the Fukushima Health Management Survey to investigate long-term low-dose radiation exposure caused by the accident. Fukushima Medical University {{took the lead in}} planning and implementing this survey. The primary purposes of this survey are to monitor the long-term health of residents, promote their future well-being, and confirm whether long-term low-dose radiation exposure has health effects. This report describes the rationale and implementation of the Fukushima Health Management Survey. Methods: This cohort study enrolled all people living in Fukushima Prefecture after the earthquake and comprises a basic survey and 4 detailed surveys. The basic survey is to estimate levels of external radiation exposure among all 2. 05 million residents. It should be noted that internal radiation levels were estimated by Fukushima Prefecture using <b>whole-body</b> <b>counters.</b> The detailed surveys comprise a thyroid ultrasound examination for all Fukushima children aged 18 years or younger, a comprehensive health check for all residents from the evacuation zones, an assessment of mental health and lifestyles of all residents from the evacuation zones, and recording of all pregnancies and birth...|$|R
40|$|A {{large amount}} of {{radioactive}} cesium was released by the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident following the Great East Japan Earthquake. Due to the increasing concerns about internal exposure, more than 50 <b>whole-body</b> <b>counters</b> (WBCs) have been installed at various locations in Fukushima Prefecture. A study on around 10, 000 subjects in the early stage after the accident revealed that very few received a committed effective dose of more than 0. 3 mSv for subjects (age > 13 years old). Another study on WBC results for one hospital showed that the ratio of cesium-positive was 1. 0 % among all the subjects. Assuming a constant daily intake, the detection limit of 300 Bq/body for a typical WBC corresponds to an effective dose of 21 μSv/y even for a subject of age up to 10. It was also seen out that the subjects with {{a significant amount of}} body cesium are likely to regularly eat wild products, which they harvested or caught themselves without testing for radioactive cesium. These study findings suggested that the internal exposure for most of the residents was controlled at a very low level. Future tasks regarding WBC measurements are how to personally explain the WBC results to each subject and how to disclose the statistically processed WBC data to the general public...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{substantial}} {{proportion of}} total body potassium (TBK) in humans {{is found in}} skeletal muscle (SM), thus affording a means of predicting total-body SM from whole-body counter–measured 40 K. There are now> 30 <b>whole-body</b> <b>counters</b> worldwide that have large cross-sectional and longitudinal TBK databases. Objective: We explored 2 SM prediction approaches, one {{based on the assumption}} that the ratio of TBK to SM is stable in healthy adults and the other on a multiple regression TBK-SM prediction equation. Design: Healthy subjects aged ≥ 20 y were recruited for body-composition evaluation. TBK and SM were measured by whole-body 40 K counting and multislice magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. A conceptual model with empirically derived data was developed to link TBK and adipose tissue–free SM as the ratio of TBK to SM. Results: A total of 300 subjects (139 men and 161 women) of var-ious ethnicities with a mean (± SD) body mass index (in kg/m 2) of 25. 1 ± 5. 4 met the study entry criteria. The mean conceptual model–derived TBK-SM ratio was 122 mmol/kg, which was com-parable to the measurement-derived TBK-SM ratios in men and women (119. 9 ± 6. 7 and 118. 7 ± 8. 4 mmol/kg, respectively), although the ratio tended to be lower in subjects aged ≥ 70 y. A strong linear correlation was observed between TBK and SM (r = 0. 98, P < 0. 001), with sex, race, and age as small but signifi-cant prediction model covariates. Conclusions: Two different types of prediction models were developed that provide validated approaches for estimating SM mass from 40 K measurements by whole-body counting. These methods afford an opportunity to predict SM mass from TBK data collected in healthy adults. Am J Clin Nutr 2003; 77 : 76 – 82.

40|$|At {{the outset}} of the {{accident}} at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in March 2011, the radiation doses experienced by residents were calculated from the readings at monitoring posts, with several assumptions being made {{from the point of view}} of protection and safety. However, health effects should also be estimated by obtaining measurements of the individual radiation doses. The individual external radiation doses, determined by a behavior survey in the "evacuation and deliberate evacuation area" in the first 4 months, were < 5 mSv in 97. 4 % of residents (maximum: 15 mSv). Doses in Fukushima Prefecture were < 3 mSv in 99. 3 % of 386, 572 residents analyzed. External doses in Fukushima City determined by personal dosimeters were < 1 mSv/ 3 months (September-November, 2011) in 99. 7 % of residents (maximum: 2. 7 mSv). Thyroid radiation doses, determined in March using a NaI (TI) scintillation survey meter in children in the evacuation and deliberate evacuation area, were < 10 mSv in 95. 7 % of children (maximum: 35 mSv). Therefore, all doses were less than the intervention level of 50 mSv proposed by international organizations. Internal radiation doses determined by cesium- 134 (134 C) and cesium- 137 (137 C) <b>whole-body</b> <b>counters</b> (WBCs) were < 1 mSv in 99 % of the residents, and the maximum thyroid equivalent dose by iodine- 131 WBCs was 20 mSv. The exploratory committee of the Fukushima Health Management Survey mentions on its website that radiation from the accident is unlikely to be a cause of adverse health effects in the future. In any event, sincere scientific efforts must continue to obtain individual radiation doses that are as accurate as possible. However, observation of the health effects of the radiation doses described above will require reevaluation of the protocol used for determining adverse health effects. The dose-response relationship is crucial, and the aim of the survey should be to collect sufficient data to confirm the presence or absence of radiation health effects. In particular, the schedule of decontamination needs reconsideration. The decontamination map is determined based on the results of airborne monitoring and the radiation dose calculated from readings taken at the monitoring posts at the initial period of the accident. The decontamination protocol should be reevaluated based on the individual doses of the people who desire to live in those areas...|$|R

40|$|In {{preparation}} for the planned mathematical efficiency calibration of a <b>whole-body</b> <b>counter,</b> models of the four HPGe detectors have to be developed as input for Monte Carlo simulations. The results {{for two of the}} detectors are presented here. With the initial detector models, based on data provided by the manufacturer, calculated efficiencies for various photon energies and measuring geometries were 10 - 20 % Loo high compared with the measured efficiencies. To obtain more reliable information about the constructional features, scanning measurements with collimated radiation were performed at the front window and the sides of each detector. Using the information from these measurements, the initial detector model was improved by comparing the measured efficiencies with efficiencies calculated by the Monte Carlo code MCNP 4 C 2 and correcting the model by an iterative process if necessary. Finally, the quality of the detector models was verified by measurements with uncollimated point sources, which were placed in 77 different positions on a 10 cm x 10 cm grid on the stretcher of the <b>whole-body</b> <b>counter.</b> For all photon energies and all source positions the deviation between measured and simulated efficiencies was found to be less than 3 %.

Our study included residents of the cities of Minamisoma and Soma (10 - 40 km and 35 - 50 km north of the Fukushima Daiichi (N° 1) Nuclear Power Station, respectively). We used {{the loss of life}} expectancy (LLE) as an indicator to compare risks between radiation exposure and diabetes. We also estimated the cost-effectiveness of radiation-related countermeasures, including restricted food distribution, decontamination, and <b>whole-body</b> <b>counter</b> tests and interventions. Metformin therapy was selected as a representative management for diabetes. The diabetes-related LLEs among residents were 4. 1 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 4 - 6. 8) × 10 - 2 years for the whole population and 8. 0 (2. 7 - 13. 2) × 10 - 2 years for 40 s to 70 s in a scenario that considered the additional incidence of diabetes during the first 10 years. The cancer-related LLEs caused by lifetime exposure to radiation were 0. 69 (2. 5 - 97. 5 percentile: 0. 61 - 0. 79) × 10 - 2 years for the whole population and 0. 24 (0. 20 - 0. 29) × 10 - 2 years for 40 s to 70 s. The diabetes-related LLEs among residents in the above-mentioned scenario were 5. 9 -fold and 33 -fold higher than those attributed to average radiation among the whole population and among the 40 s to 70 s age groups, respectively.

If 90 Sr ingestion occurred during the woman's reproductive age, the transfer to fetus was equal to 0. 21 - 0. 26...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The uptake, tissue {{distribution}} and retention patterns of cadmium, mercury and zinc {{were examined in}} the freshwater mussel, Margaritifera margaritifera. All three of these heavy metals {{are found in the}} environment. Both cadmium and mercury are toxic at low environmental concentrations. Zinc may also be toxic at low concentrations but is also a required microelement in plants and animals. The mussels were maintained in separate solutions containing radioisotopes of these metals at 14. 5 °C. The uptake was followed for 39 to 80 days of chronic exposure, at which time a near equilibrium was reached in most experiments. At this point all animals were placed in uncontaminated water. Half of them were sampled at intervals to determine changes in {{tissue distribution}}. The remainder were regularly counted to determine the pattern of retention. An Armac liquid scintillation <b>whole-body</b> <b>counter</b> was used for all determinations. The tissue distribution. was remarkably constant over separate studies lasting from 67 to 150 days. Multicomponent retention patterns were observed for each metal. The percent of original whole-body activity remaining after 81 days was 87...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerns}} the monitoring {{of children from}} the Byelorussian, Ukrainian and Russian republics exposed to the fall-out of the Chernobyl accident. Cytogenetic analyses have been performed on 41 children coming from different areas and exhibiting varying amounts of Cs- 137 internal contamination, as evaluated by <b>whole-body</b> <b>counter</b> (WBC) analysis. On a total of 28670 metaphases scored, radiation-induced chromosome damage is still present, although at a very low frequency. Due to the very low fraction of dicentrics, {{because of the time}} elapsed from the accident and the relatively low doses of exposure, radiobiological dosimetry is not possible for these children. However, considering that the WBC data indicate that the children are still exposed to Cs- 137 contamination, the observed occurrence of stable chromosome rearrangements and breaks may represent the persisting effect of continuous low doses of radiation. The present study also indicates that the parallel use of internal contamination dosimetry and cytogenetics could be usefully employed to monitor individual exposure to radiation and to define further management measures...|$|E
40|$|A {{description}} is given of a whole-body counting technique using radiotracers, permitting {{the determination of}} true absorption and endogenous excretion of trace elements and minerals in the rat in vivo. This non-invasive counting method involves oral and intraperitoneal administration of tracer doses of a radioisotope in a cross-over fashion and subsequent measurement of the whole-body retention in a <b>whole-body</b> <b>counter.</b> Thus, true absorption can be determined in one animal which contributes to the reduction of animal use. To study the variations in counting response due to radioisotope distribution, to size or shape of the animal body, {{the influence of the}} position of a point source and distribution over different phantoms to simulate various body sizes are experimentally evaluated for 64 Cu, 65 Zn, 59 Fe and 28 Mg. Results from 2 studies, with 64 Cu and 28 Mg, as an example for a trace element and a mineral respectively, are presented and illustrate that absorption as measured by apparent absorption does not necessarily reflect true absorption. True absorption as determined by the whole-body retention method using radioisotopes corrects for faecal losses of endogenous origin...|$|E
