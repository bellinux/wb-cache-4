5|$|A pH {{indicator}} is a {{weak acid}} or <b>weak</b> <b>base</b> that changes colour {{in the transition}} pH range, which is approximately pKa±1. The design of a universal indicator requires a mixture of indicators whose adjacent pKa values differ by about two, so that their transition pH ranges just overlap.|$|E

5|$|Amino acids {{are usually}} {{classified}} by {{the properties of}} their side chain into four groups. The side chain can make an amino acid a weak acid or a <b>weak</b> <b>base,</b> and a hydrophile if the side chain is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar. The chemical structures of the 22 standard amino acids, along with their chemical properties, are described more fully in the article on these proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E

While the plasma and lysosomal membranes are permeable for neutral and uncharged species of <b>weak</b> <b>bases,</b> the charged protonated species of <b>weak</b> <b>bases</b> do not permeate biomembranes and accumulate within lysosomes. The concentration within lysosomes may reach levels 100 to 1000 fold higher than extracellular concentrations. This phenomenon is called [...] "lysosomotropism" [...] or [...] "acid trapping". The amount of accumulation of lysosomotropic compounds may be estimated using a cell-based mathematical model.|$|R

5|$|The {{newly formed}} tricoordinated {{phosphite}} triester linkage is not natural and is of limited stability under {{the conditions of}} oligonucleotide synthesis. The treatment of the support-bound material with iodine and water {{in the presence of}} a <b>weak</b> <b>base</b> (pyridine, lutidine, or collidine) oxidizes the phosphite triester into a tetracoordinated phosphate triester, a protected precursor of the naturally occurring phosphate diester internucleosidic linkage. Oxidation may be carried out under anhydrous conditions using tert-Butyl hydroperoxide or, more efficiently, (1S)-(+)-(10-camphorsulfonyl)-oxaziridine (CSO). The step of oxidation is substituted with a sulfurization step to obtain oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (see Oligonucleotide phosphorothioates and their synthesis below). In the latter case, the sulfurization step is best carried out prior to capping.|$|E
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing electropositive cations and basic anions ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. If the compound {{is the result of}} a reaction between a strong acid and a <b>weak</b> <b>base,</b> the result is an acidic salt. If it {{is the result of a}} reaction between a strong base and a weak acid, the result is a basic salt. If it is the result of a reaction between a strong acid and a strong base, the result is a neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the conjugate base ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium acetate.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of focusing <b>weak</b> <b>bases</b> using a transient pH boundary was examined via high-resolution computer simulation software. Emphasis {{was placed on}} the mechanism and impact that the presence of salt, namely, NaCl, has on the ability to focus <b>weak</b> <b>bases.</b> A series of <b>weak</b> <b>bases</b> with mobilities ranging from 5 × 10 - 9 to 30 × 10 - 9 m 2 /V·s and pKa values between 3. 0 and 7. 5 were examined using a combination of 65. 6 mM formic acid, pH 2. 85, for the separation electrolyte, and 65. 6 mM formic acid, pH 8. 60, for the sample matrix. Simulation data show {{that it is possible to}} focus <b>weak</b> <b>bases</b> with a pKa value similar to that of the separation electrolyte, but it is restricted to <b>weak</b> <b>bases</b> having an electrophoretic mobility of 20 × 10 - 9 m 2 /V·s or quicker. This mobility range can be extended by the addition of NaCl, with 50 mM NaCl allowing stacking of <b>weak</b> <b>bases</b> down to a mobility of 15 × 10 - 9 m 2 /V·s and 100 mM extending the range to 10 × 10 - 9 m 2 /V·s. The addition of NaCl does not adversely influence focusing of more mobile bases, but does prolong the existence of the transient pH boundary. This allows analytes to migrate extensively through the capillary as a single focused band around the transient pH boundary until the boundary is dissipated. This reduces the length of capillary that is available for separation and, in extreme cases, causes multiple analytes to be detected as a single highly efficient peak...|$|R

25|$|Being {{an analog}} of pyridine, {{isoquinoline}} is a <b>weak</b> <b>base,</b> with a pKa of 5.14. It protonates to form salts upon treatment with strong acids, such as HCl. It forms adducts with Lewis acids, such as BF3.|$|E
25|$|Both {{morphine}} and its hydrated form, C17H19NO3H2O, are {{sparingly soluble}} in water. In five liters of water, only one gram of the hydrate will dissolve. For this reason, pharmaceutical companies produce sulfate and hydrochloride salts of the drug, {{both of which}} are over 300 times more water-soluble than their parent molecule. Whereas the pH of a saturated morphine hydrate solution is 8.5, the salts are acidic. Since they derive from a strong acid but <b>weak</b> <b>base,</b> they are both at about pH = 5; as a consequence, the morphine salts are mixed with small amounts of NaOH to make them suitable for injection.|$|E
25|$|King was Laurier's chosen {{successor}} {{as leader}} of the Liberal Party, but it was deeply divided by Quebec's total opposition to conscription and the agrarian revolt in Ontario and the Prairies. Levin argues that when King returned to politics in 1919, he was a rusty outsider with a <b>weak</b> <b>base</b> facing a nation bitterly split by language, regionalism and class. He outmaneuvered more senior competitors by embracing Laurier's legacy, championing labour interests, calling for welfare reform, and offering solid opposition to the Conservative enemy. When Laurier died in 1919, King was elected leader in the first Liberal leadership convention, defeating his four rivals on the fourth ballot. He won thanks to the support of the Quebec bloc, organized by his long-time lieutenant in Quebec, Ernest Lapointe (1876–1941). King could not speak French and had minimal interest in Quebec, but in election after election for the next 20 years (save for 1930), Lapointe produced the critical seats to give the Liberals control of the Commons. He was almost co-Prime Minister with King until his death in 1941.|$|E

500|$|The α-carboxylic {{acid group}} of amino acids is a weak acid, {{meaning that it}} {{releases}} a hydron (such as a proton) at moderate pH values.

[...] The negatively charged carboxylate ion predominates at pH values greater than the pKa of the carboxylic acid group (mean for the 20 common amino acids is about 2.2, see the table of amino acid structures above). [...] In a complementary fashion, the α-amine of amino acids is a <b>weak</b> <b>base,</b> meaning that it accepts a proton at moderate pH values. [...] In other words, α-amino groups (NH2−) can be protonated to become positive α-ammonium groups (+NH3−). [...] The positively charged α-ammonium group predominates at pH values less than the pKa of the α-ammonium group (mean for the 20 common α-amino acids is about 9.4).|$|E
500|$|Industrially, ammonia (NH3) is {{the most}} {{important}} compound of nitrogen and is prepared in larger amounts than any other compound, because it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilisers. It is a colourless alkaline gas with a characteristic pungent smell. The presence of hydrogen bonding has very significant effects on ammonia, conferring on it its high melting (−78°C) and boiling (−33°C) points. As a liquid, it is a very good solvent with a high heat of vaporisation (enabling it to be used in vacuum flasks), that also has a low viscosity and electrical conductivity and high dielectric constant, and is less dense than water. However, the hydrogen bonding in NH3 is weaker than that in H2O due to the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared to oxygen and the presence of only one lone pair in NH3 rather than two in H2O. It is a <b>weak</b> <b>base</b> in aqueous solution (pK'b 4.74); its conjugate acid is ammonium, [...] It can also act as an extremely weak acid, losing a proton to produce the amide anion, [...] It thus undergoes self-dissociation, similar to water, to produce ammonium and amide. Ammonia burns in air or oxygen, though not readily, to produce nitrogen gas; it burns in fluorine with a greenish-yellow flame to give nitrogen trifluoride. Reactions with the other nonmetals are very complex and tend to lead to a mixture of products. Ammonia reacts on heating with metals to give nitrides.|$|E
