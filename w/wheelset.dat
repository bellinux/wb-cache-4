25|$|This is energy {{lost from}} the system, {{so in order}} for the motion to continue, an equal amount of energy must be {{extracted}} from the forward motion of the <b>wheelset.</b>|$|E
25|$|The motion {{components}} cost £150,000: taking £50,000 {{to forge}} (and requiring {{three years to}} complete) and £100,000 to machine. The <b>wheelset</b> was the first mainline steam locomotive <b>wheelset</b> to be manufactured in Britain since 1960, and took five years, involved nine suppliers and cost £100,000, even with generous sponsorship. The wheels were so smooth that the complete locomotive could easily be pushed out of the works by human power alone, as seen when the locomotive was moved outside {{in preparation for the}} first steam-powered moves. If the locomotive were to be suspended, the entire wheel and motion arrangement could be turned by hand.|$|E

25|$|On 29 January 1910, {{an express}} {{passenger}} train became divided and was derailed at Stoat's Nest, Surrey {{due to a}} defective <b>wheelset</b> on a carriage. Seven {{people were killed and}} 65 were injured.|$|E
25|$|Owing {{to space}} {{constraints}} at Darlington works, the Tornado tender frames and body were built off-site, {{with the body}} being significantly built locally in Darlington. The tender wheelsets were assembled by an East Lancs Railway-based company. The tender frame and <b>wheelset</b> were united by December 2007, and the tank attached to it by February 2008.|$|E
25|$|Two main matters i.e. {{assuming}} {{the body as}} a fixed support and influence of the nonlinear elements in calculation of the hunting speed are mostly focused in studies. A real railway vehicle has many more degrees of freedom and, consequently, may {{have more than one}} critical speed; {{it is by no means}} certain that the lowest is dictated by the <b>wheelset</b> motion.|$|E

25|$|Guests board an Enhanced Motion Vehicle (EMV) {{intended}} {{to appear as}} a battered military troop transport. EMVs ride on neoprene filled tires (for operational precision) driven by hydraulic rotors that provide forward motion, hydraulic pressure is applied on-board each vehicle at 3,000 psi using DC pressurizers. The vehicle has four wheel steering atop {{the surface of a}} slotted roadbed. The track has only three switches: a left/right split switch just before loading/unloading, a left/right combine switch just after safety check station/dispatch and a compound switch to swap vehicles in/out of the maintenance bay, behind the mirrors. Beneath the slot a tubular guideway guides the front <b>wheelset</b> and a damper for the rear <b>wheelset,</b> and three electrical buss bars provide the EMV 480 volts AC. The power is divided among the two motion systems, control, safety and audio systems. Each transport can accommodate twelve guests with three rows of seats, four across, with the front left seat behind a non-operational steering wheel.|$|E
25|$|In October 1999 a £250,000 {{appeal was}} {{launched}} {{to fund the}} boiler, whose absence was noticeable with Tornado then comprising a wheeled frame with completed cab and smokebox. As Tornado began {{to look like a}} locomotive with the mating of the frame with the <b>wheelset</b> in the Autumn of 2000, fundraising progress increased, breaking previous records by recruiting 100 new covenantors in two months. By 2005, the trust had raised over £1.5m.|$|E
25|$|A {{classical}} hunting oscillation is a swaying {{motion of}} a railway vehicle (often called truck hunting) {{caused by the}} coning action on which the directional stability of an adhesion railway depends. It arises from the interaction of adhesion forces and inertial forces. At low speed, adhesion dominates but, as the speed increases, the adhesion forces and inertial forces become comparable in magnitude and the oscillation begins at a critical speed. Above this speed, the motion can be violent, damaging track and wheels and potentially causing derailment. The problem does not occur on systems with a differential because the action depends on both wheels of a <b>wheelset</b> rotating at the same angular rate, although differentials tend to be rare, and conventional trains have their wheels fixed to the axles in pairs instead.|$|E
50|$|Provided {{the radius}} of turn is {{sufficiently}} great (as {{should be expected}} for express passenger services), two or three linked <b>wheelsets</b> should not present a problem. However, 10 drive wheels (5 main <b>wheelsets)</b> are usually associated with heavy freight locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Understanding how {{the train}} {{stays on the}} track, it becomes evident why Victorian {{locomotive}} engineers were averse to coupling <b>wheelsets.</b> This simple coning action is possible only with <b>wheelsets</b> where each can have some free motion about its vertical axis. If <b>wheelsets</b> are rigidly coupled together, this motion is restricted, so that coupling the wheels {{would be expected to}} introduce sliding, resulting in increased rolling losses. This problem was alleviated to a great extent by ensuring the diameter of all coupled wheels was very closely matched.|$|R
5000|$|All the <b>wheelsets</b> of {{the wagons}} and many brake {{components}} were retained by the railway for future use. In 2012 two <b>wheelsets</b> {{were incorporated into}} a new-build, four-wheeled flat wagon nicknamed [...] "FAT 1", which is currently {{being used as a}} base for the construction of Brown Bear.|$|R
2500|$|This {{kinematic}} description makes {{a number}} of simplifying assumptions since it neglects forces. [...] For one, it assumes that the rolling resistance is zero. [...] A <b>wheelset</b> (not attached to a train or truck), is given a push forward on a straight and level track. [...] The <b>wheelset</b> starts coasting and never slows down {{since there are no}} forces (except downward forces on the <b>wheelset</b> to make it adhere to the track and not slip). [...] If initially the <b>wheelset</b> is centered on the railroad track then the effective diameters of each wheel are the same and the <b>wheelset</b> rolls down the track in a perfectly straight line forever. [...] But if the <b>wheelset</b> is a little off-center so that the effective diameters (or radii) are different, then the <b>wheelset</b> starts to move in a curve of Radius R (depending on these <b>wheelset</b> radii, etc.; to be derived later on). [...] The problem is to use kinematic reasoning to find the trajectory of the <b>wheelset,</b> or more precisely, the trajectory of the center of the <b>wheelset</b> projected vertically on the roadbed {{in the center of the}} track. [...] This is a trajectory on the plane of the level earth's surface and plotted on an x-y graphical plot where x is the distance along the railroad and y is the [...] "tracking error", the deviation of the center of the <b>wheelset</b> from the straight line of the railway running down the center of the track (midway between the two rails).|$|E
2500|$|To {{illustrate}} that a <b>wheelset</b> trajectory follows a curved path, one may place a nail or screw {{on a flat}} table top {{and give it a}} push. [...] It will roll in a curved circle because the nail or screw is like a <b>wheelset</b> with extremely different diameter wheels. [...] The head is analogous to a large diameter wheel and the pointed end is like a small diameter wheel. [...] While the nail or screw will turn around in a full circle (and more) the railroad <b>wheelset</b> behaves differently because as soon at it starts to turn in a curve, the effective diameters change {{in such a way as}} to decrease the curvature of the path. [...] Note that [...] "radius" [...] and [...] "curvature" [...] refer to the curvature of the trajectory of the <b>wheelset</b> and not the curvature of the railway since this is perfectly straight track. [...] As the <b>wheelset</b> rolls on, the curvature decreases until the wheels reach the point where their effective diameters are equal and the path is no longer curving. [...] But the trajectory has a slope at this point (it is a straight line which crosses diagonally over the centerline of the track) so that it overshoots the centerline of the track and the effective diameters reverse (the formerly smaller diameter wheel becomes the larger diameter and conversely). [...] This results in the <b>wheelset</b> moving in a curve in the opposite direction. [...] Again it overshoots the centerline and this phenomenon continues indefinitely with the <b>wheelset</b> oscillating from side to side. [...] Note that the wheel flange never makes contact with the rail. [...] In this model, the rails are assumed to always contact the wheel tread along the same line on the rail head which assumes that the rails are knife-edge and only make contact with the wheel tread along a line (of zero width).|$|E

30|$|The vehicle {{structure}} was symmetrical, {{and the left}} and right rails on the curved track were arranged symmetrically. The vehicle always traveled forward and backward on the line, thus the wheel wear for <b>wheelsets</b> one and four was the same, and for <b>wheelsets</b> two and three was also the same.|$|R

2500|$|However, the {{kinematic}} analysis {{assumed that}} there was no slippage at all at the wheel-rail contact. [...] Now it's clear that there is some creep slippage which makes the calculated sinusoidal trajectory of the <b>wheelset</b> (per Klingel's formula) not exactly correct.|$|E
2500|$|However, the {{analysis}} is instructive because it shows why hunting occurs. [...] As the speed increases, the inertial forces become comparable with the adhesion forces. [...] That is why the critical speed depends on {{the ratio of the}} axle load (which determines the adhesion force) to the <b>wheelset</b> mass (which determines the inertial forces).|$|E
2500|$|The train {{stays on}} the track {{by virtue of the}} conical shape of the wheel treads. [...] If a <b>wheelset</b> is {{displaced}} to one side by an amount [...] "y" [...] (the tracking error), the radius of the tread in contact with the rail on one side is reduced, while on the other side it is increased. [...] The angular velocity is the same for both wheels (they are coupled via a rigid axle), so the larger diameter tread speeds up, while the smaller slows down. [...] The wheel set steers around a centre of curvature defined by the intersection of the generator of a cone passing through the points of contact with the wheels on the rails and the axis of the wheel set.

The interaction between rail and wheel causes rigid-body motions as well as structural vibrations. First of all accelerations are decomposed into their symmetric and antimetric components, followed by a time frequency analysis using the short-time Fourier transform. Simulations and experiments on a full-scale test rig underline the potentials of this approach for the identification of the <b>wheelset's</b> bending modes. The torsional modes cannot be directly observed at the axle-boxes, they have to be estimated by the dynamic interaction between the <b>wheelset's</b> yawing and lateral motion...|$|R
2500|$|In December 1945 F-M {{produced}} {{its first}} streamlined, cab/carbody dual service diesel locomotive as direct competition to such models as the ALCO PA and EMD E-unit.

GE built the locomotives at its Erie, Pennsylvania facility, thereby giving rise to the name “Erie-built”. F-M retained the services of renowned industrial designer Raymond Loewy to create a visually impressive carbody for the Erie-built. The line was only moderately successful, as a total of 82 cab and 28 booster units was sold through 1949, when production was ended. A nine-month strike by the Beloit, WI shop forces right at the beginning doomed the project. [...] The Erie-built’s successor was to be manufactured in Beloit and designed from the ground up; the result of this effort was the Consolidated line, which debuted in January 1950.|$|E
