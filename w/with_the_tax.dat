He instituted a system of regular annual indictiones ("tax levies") <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> demanded set in advance for 5 years and related to the amount of cultivated land in each province, backed by a thorough empire-wide census of land, peasants and livestock. To deal with the problem of rural depopulation in some areas (and consequent loss of food production), he decreed that peasants, who had always been free to leave their land during the Principate, must never leave the locality in which they were registered by the census (legal term is 'origo'). This measure had the effect of legally tying tenant farmers (coloni) and their descendants to their landlords' estates.|$|E

25|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and {{its impact}} on the {{alternative}} minimum tax (AMT) reduced nominal rates on the wealthy and eliminated tax deductions, while raising tax rates on lower-income individuals. The across the board tax system reduced marginal rates and further reduced bracket creep from inflation. The highest income earners (with incomes exceeding $1,000,000) received a tax break, restoring a flatter tax system. In 2006, the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's report characterized the effective rise in the AMT for individuals as a problem <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> code.

25|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tax</b> Reform Act of 1986, Reagan and Congress {{sought to}} simplify the tax system by {{eliminating}} many deductions, reducing the highest marginal rates, and {{reducing the number of}} tax brackets. In 1983, Democrats Bill Bradley and Dick Gephardt had offered a proposal; in 1984 Reagan had the Treasury Department produce its own plan. The eventual bipartisan 1986 act aimed to be revenue-neutral: while it reduced the top marginal rate, it also cleaned up the tax base by removing certain tax write-offs, preferences, and exceptions, thus raising the effective tax on activities previously specially favored by the code. Ultimately, the combination of the decrease in deductions and decrease in rates, raised revenue equal to about 4% of existing tax revenue.|$|E

25|$|After taking office, Welsh was {{immediately}} {{confronted with the}} state's $18.2 million budget deficit.

The public, however, was not pleased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> increase, and was a factor Handley's defeat for the United States Senate in 1958. Despite the previous public reaction, Welsh recommended an additional tax increase to cover the deficit. The Indiana General Assembly, however, was divided with Republican strongly controlling the House, and the Democrats with only a two-vote majority in the Senate. This created deadlock on most of Welsh's taxing measures. He was able to advocate the passage of the Property Tax Assessment Act of 1961 which improved the efficiency of the revenue department, gaining the government money in administrative savings, and reimposing a small state property tax; the state property taxes had only recently been repealed in the state. A second reform bill was passed creating the Division of Tax Review which had power to review and reassess property taxes statewide. The Division of Audit was also created, which for the first time which allowed the government to audit tax data and forcibly collect it and also begin cross-checking state tax returns with federal tax returns. Warrant officers were hired who, with the assistance of a local sheriff, could seize money and property to pay delinquent tax debts. This led to thousands of individuals statewide having their unpaid back taxes seized by the government. Despite all the activity, state revenue still fell short forcing the government to use its reserve funds; an even larger deficit was predicted for the 1958 tax year.|$|E
