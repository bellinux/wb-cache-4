25|$|This first Arājs {{action was}} later {{described}} by Georg Rosenstock, {{the commander of}} the second company of the 13th Police Reserve battalion. Rosenstock testified after the war that when he and his unit had arrived in Liepāja in July, 1941, they had heard from some passing marines that Jews were being continuously executed in the town, and these marines <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> to watch the executions. A few days later, on Saturday, July 24, 1941, Rosenstock saw Jews (whom he identified by the yellow stars on their clothing) crouching down {{in the back of a}} truck, being guarded by armed Latvians. Rosenstock, who was himself in a vehicle, followed the truck to the north of the city to the beach near the naval base, where he saw Kügler, some SD men, and a number of Jews.|$|E

500|$|The lyrical themes on Dig Me Out {{deal with}} issues of heartbreak and survival. The song [...] "One More Hour" [...] is about the breakup of Tucker and Brownstein's romantic relationship. Before {{the release of the}} album, Spin {{published}} a controversial article discussing Tucker and Brownstein's personal relationship without their permission. Brownstein felt that [...] "it was a complete invasion of privacy. My parents didn't know Corin and I <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>out.</b> They didn't know I had ever dated a woman before. It was horrible. I was pissed at Spin, really mad. Luckily my parents are great people, but God forbid I would have some family that would disown me over something like that. And I would have totally held Spin responsible for that." [...] The song features a lot of vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein. Chris Nelson of Addicted to Noise noted that [...] "one can almost hear Tucker crying in the studio as she wails, 'I needed it', while behind her Brownstein offers her attempts at consolation". In her 2015 memoir Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl, Brownstein also states that almost all the songs on Dig Me Out are about either her or Tucker's future husband, Lance Bangs.|$|E
500|$|By {{spring of}} 1997, the real-life {{backstage}} conflict between Michaels and Hart were reaching its heights. Both men <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> {{on television and}} frequently making personal, true to heart remarks about one another. Michaels briefly left the WWF in June of that year after a real backstage fight with Hart, just hours before a Raw Is War show, which allegedly resulted from Michaels making an on-air remark, known as the [...] "Sunny Days" [...] comment, implying that Hart (who was married at the time) {{was having an affair}} with Tammy Sytch, a Diva who was signed to the WWF as Sunny. Michaels and Austin were still WWF Tag Team Champions at the time during an ongoing feud with the Hart Foundation and a tournament was made to decide new tag team champions. Michaels would eventually return that summer in July. At SummerSlam, Michaels officiated the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match between WWF Champion The Undertaker and Bret Hart. The match ended in controversial fashion, with Michaels hitting Undertaker with a chair (unintentionally, as he was aiming for Hart after he spat in his face). Michaels was then forced to award the championship to his nemesis, Bret Hart. The next night on Raw Is War, signs of a heel turn started to show as Michaels told the WWF fans what happened at SummerSlam was an accident and that he would deal with the Undertaker when the time came. At WWF One Night Only, held in Birmingham, England in September, Michaels defeated The British Bulldog to capture the European Championship. The fans at the event were so appalled at the result of the match they booed Michaels out of the building to the extent that they littered the ring with garbage, cementing his second heel turn. With this win, Michaels became the first Grand Slam Champion. At , Michaels and Undertaker participated in the first Hell in a Cell match, during which Michaels fall off the side of the [...] high structure through a table and saw him as the winner in the match after the debuting Kane tombstoned his victory bound half-brother, The Undertaker. The match received a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer.|$|E
2500|$|Spurred on {{by urban}} planner Robert Moses, the city {{replaced}} some of Brownsville's old tenements with public housing blocks. Although {{the neighborhood was}} racially segregated, there were more attempts at improved quality of life, public mixing, and solidarity between blacks and Jews than {{could be found in}} most other neighborhoods. However, due to socioeconomic barriers imposed by the disparities between the two populations, most of these improvements never came. Compounding the matter, the newly arrived African-American residents were mainly industrial workers who had moved to Brownsville just as the area's factories <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of business, so the black residents were more economically disadvantaged than the Jews who had historically lived in Brownsville. Finally, although both blacks and Jews living in Brownsville had been subject to ethnic discrimination, the situation for blacks was worse, as they were banned from some public places where Jews were allowed, and the New York City Police Department (NYPD) generally behaved more harshly toward blacks more than toward Jews.|$|E

2500|$|On 4 April, Chelsea {{progressed to}} the Champions League semi-finals {{for the sixth}} time in nine seasons, {{courtesy}} of a 3–1 aggregate win over Benfica. This set up a tie against holders Barcelona, the sixth time the two clubs had been drawn {{against each other in}} the competition, and the fifth in eight years. On 15 April, Chelsea progressed to their third FA cup semi-final in four seasons by thrashing rivals Tottenham 5–1 at Wembley; Didier Drogba scored first to extend his incredible record of scoring at every match he'd played there (seven at the time). Three days later, Chelsea faced Barcelona at Stamford Bridge as heavy underdogs. Despite Barcelona dominating possession and having the greater number of chances, Chelsea secured a hard-fought 1–0 win to gain the upper hand. In the return leg a week later at Camp Nou, it looked like Chelsea <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> as they went 2–0 down and had captain John Terry sent off within the first 45 minutes. However, a goal on the stroke of half-time from Ramires put Chelsea into a winning position, one which they maintained thanks to a Lionel Messi penalty miss. In the dying moments, Fernando Torres scored to clinch a place in the final, giving Chelsea a [...] "truly remarkable" [...] 3–2 aggregate win.|$|E
2500|$|A massive {{source of}} profits for Hiram Walker was {{actually}} the Civil War in the United States. [...] The U.S dollar plummeted in this time, and Americans turned to smuggling in Canadian beverages. [...] It is reported that Hiram Walker and Company loaded jug after jug of whiskey onto American ferries, carrying them across the Detroit River, leading to Walker making massive profits. Jealous competitors constructed a story of Walker creating a lead pipe that led right from the distillery, under the Detroit River, and into Detroit. By 1863, Walker had named James Ellis in charge of his mill, William McManus as his distiller, and John McBride in charge of managing. [...] While majority of his business did {{take place on the}} Canadian side of the border, he did prefer to live in Detroit. [...] In 1863, he bought a home within Detroit. [...] Walker also attempted to construct and run a vinegar factory in 1864, but was unsuccessful and closed down two years later due to his other commitments. Up until 1865, Walker’s distillery was the only one to exist in Essex County, however, Walker found himself with competition with Rolph and Melchers. In this time, Walker’s partner McBride was anxious to move up the chain within the company. [...] Two years later, John McBride and two of his friends, bought Rolph and Melchers. After discovering what McBride had done, his employment was terminated, therefore, Walker lost his business partner. [...] Ironically, McBride and his partners would end up having to sell their property because they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of business and would be operated by Hiram Walker as a second plant until 1876. [...] John McBride would go on to become a tax collector and grocery store owner in Detroit.|$|E
