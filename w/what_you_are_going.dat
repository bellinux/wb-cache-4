If that happens and you are lucky, it can usually {{be turned into a}} song. This song is a prayer and personal statement between me, the Lord, and whoever likes it.|$|E
500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as {{we want it to}} be. The whole idea is that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E
2500|$|And now, O Nibelungen Spectator, pluck up; for all allegories {{come to an}} end somewhere... The rest of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to see is opera, {{and nothing}} but opera.

[...] "It wasn't easy being far away from your family", Ram remembers, [...] "but you know {{it is going to be}} your profession and that's <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to try to do for life.

2500|$|The film {{score by}} John Williams was {{recorded}} in late March and early April 2011. Tuba player Jim Self reported in May 2011: [...] "For John Williams I [...] recently finished recording for the film War Horse. It's a war movie so the score {{has a lot of}} brass—but it was gentle music often." [...] English folk singer John Tams, who wrote the songs for the stage production of War Horse, was approached by Spielberg and Williams about including one of his songs from the stageshow in the film. In the liner notes to the film soundtrack cd, Spielberg wrote [...] "I feel that John has made a special gift to me of this music, which was inspired not only by my film but also by many of the picturesque settings of the poet William Wordsworth, whose vivid descriptions of the British landscape inspired much of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to hear." [...] In the premiere of three of the tracks on New York radio station WQXR’s [...] "Movies on the Radio", broadcaster David Garland drew parallels with the work of British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams.|$|E
