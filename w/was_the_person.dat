5|$|Monk's {{assistant}} Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram) {{suspects that}} St. Claire's wife Miranda <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> who ordered her husband's assassination. Sharona's theory {{is supported by}} the fact that St. Claire is worth $150 million, but Monk thinks about other hypotheses, including one in which Miranda is having an affair with one of St. Claire's assistants. Things become clearer in Monk's mind when he watches a news report on the assassination attempt. Monk regroups everyone at the place of the campaign rally to recreate what happened that day.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, 2002, the Los Angeles Police busted {{a meeting}} of ecstasy dealers {{in the midst of}} a drug and money exchange, confiscating over 400,000 tablets of the drug, valued at more than $5 million.

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, many people assumed Jack Fingleton, the only full-time journalist on either team, was responsible. This belief {{may have affected}} {{the course of his}} subsequent career. Fingleton later wrote that Donald Bradman, Australia's star batsman and the primary target of Bodyline, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> who disclosed the story. Bradman always denied this, and continued to blame Fingleton; animosity between the pair continued {{for the rest of their}} lives. Woodfull's earlier public silence on the tactics had been interpreted as approval; the leak was significant in persuading the Australian public that Bodyline was unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Kindt {{retired from}} {{football}} after the 1955 season {{to focus on}} a coaching career. In 1956, Curly Lambeau named Kindt as one of the assistant coaches for his College All-Stars squad, alongside future Hall of Famers Tony Canadeo, and Mike Michalske to play against the Cleveland Browns in an exhibition game. Again he was named as a coach for the College All-Stars in 1957. Kindt <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> in charge of the University of Wisconsin alumni varsity football game in 1958. He was married for over 50 years, and had three children, one of whom, Don Kindt, Jr. also played for the Chicago Bears in 1987. After his brief coaching stint ended, Kindt became a salesperson for the Badger Meter Company in Milwaukee, retiring in 1988. Kindt also dabbled with an acting career, appearing in amateur plays in his hometown.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson {{family first}} {{appeared}} as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and {{assumed that the}} figures would be cleaned up in production.

The animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo, with Wes Archer, David Silverman, and Bill Kopp being animators for the first season.

Veronica imagines graduation if Lilly had not been murdered, and then actually graduates. Jackie reveals her true past to Wallace before leaving him finally. Veronica learns that Beaver {{was responsible for the}} bus crash and gave her chlamydia after he raped her. Beaver explodes the plane with Woody Goodman on it. Logan comes up to the roof and attacks Beaver. Afterwards, Beaver commits suicide by jumping {{off the top of the}} building. Aaron is murdered by Clarence Wiedman, and Duncan <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> responsible for the attack. Veronica and Keith plan to go to New York, but due to a business offer from Kendall, Keith misses their flight.|$|E
5|$|Before leaving England in 1189, Richard put the Tower of London in Longchamp's {{hands and}} {{appointed}} him jointly with Hugh de Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, {{to the office}} of Chief Justiciar, at that time not strictly a judicial office. Instead, the justiciar <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> entrusted with much of the king's authority when the king was outside the kingdom, able to act in the king's name. Along with Puiset, the king named Hugh Bardulf, William Briwerre, Geoffrey fitz Peter, and William Marshall as associates in the justiciarship, under Puiset and Longchamp. As Justiciar, Longchamp sent judges throughout the country to visit the shires on judicial visits, even though he had no previous knowledge of the judiciary. Longchamp and Puiset were unable to work together, and so in March 1190 Richard gave authority north of the River Humber to Hugh, and authority south of the river to Longchamp. Historian's opinions are divided whether Richard explicitly made Longchamp superior to Puiset at this time, or if in theory the two were supposed to co-equal in their respective spheres. By June, Longchamp had eased Puiset out of power and the justiciar's office. He also received a commission as a papal legate from Pope Clement III at this time. Supposedly Richard paid 1,500marks (£1,000) to the papacy to secure the legateship for Longchamp.|$|E
5|$|Fox {{negotiated}} a deal which would prove extremely lucrative for Groening, {{in which he}} retained {{a large portion of}} revenue from merchandising. To animate the short segments, Brooks and company settled on Klasky Csupo, a small animation house who offered to produce the cartoons cheaply. Brooks initially just wanted to animate the shorts through the basic line drawings, and Klasky-Csupo offered color for the same cost. The studio only employed three young animators—CalArts graduates Bill Kopp, Wes Archer, and David Silverman—who adapted Groening's scripts for animation in one week, doing layouts, animation and inbetweening by hand in the very short amount of time. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the three, and assumed that the figures would be cleaned-up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes. Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> who decided to make the characters yellow.|$|E

5|$|The Regent let his ministers {{take full}} charge of {{government}} affairs, playing a far lesser role than his father. The {{principle that the}} prime minister <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> supported by {{a majority in the}} House of Commons, whether the king personally favoured him or not, became established. His governments, with little help from the Regent, presided over British policy. One of the most important political conflicts facing the country concerned Catholic emancipation, the movement to relieve Roman Catholics of various political disabilities. The Tories, led by the Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval, were opposed to Catholic emancipation, while the Whigs supported it. At the beginning of the Regency, the Prince of Wales was expected to support the Whig leader, William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville. He did not, however, immediately put Lord Grenville and the Whigs into office. Influenced by his mother, he claimed that a sudden dismissal of the Tory government would exact too great a toll on the health of the King (a steadfast supporter of the Tories), thereby eliminating any chance of a recovery.|$|E
