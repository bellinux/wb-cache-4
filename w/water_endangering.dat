25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{magnitude}} 8.0 earthquake in Sichuan province of China on 12 May 2008, many rivers became blocked by landslides, resulting in the formation of so-called quake lakes: large amounts of water pooling up behind the landslide-formed dams. These dams eventually broke {{under the weight of the}} <b>water,</b> <b>endangering</b> those downstream. At least one Mi-26 belonging to a branch of China's civil aviation service was used to bring heavy earth moving tractors to the quake-lakes at Tangjiashan mountain, located in difficult terrain and accessible only by foot or air.|$|E

40|$|During the 'cold war' the two power blocs of {{the world}} held a colossal {{potential}} of weapons and technology in Europe, particularly at the German border and the hinterland. Up to {{the disintegration of the}} eastern military alliance, the West Group of the Soviet Armies, together with the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and its paramilitary unities, represented a high fighting strength and battle readiness on a military area of about 5000 Km" 2. Together with the properties of the western Allies (U. S. Forces, the British and the French Army, and others) and the Federal Armed Forces in the former Federal Republic of Germany, the total military area was approx. 10. 000 Km" 2 (=approximately 4 -times the surface of the federal state of Saarland). With the year 1990 the fears have been confirmed that particularly the military or former military sites held considerable dangers for the human health. Besides pollution from former production sites, other causes within the last decades were improper handling of toxic and <b>water</b> <b>endangering</b> substances. The gradual discount of the western group of the Soviet army was realized in close cooperation with the Federal Environmental Agency. Once this phase was finished, the Governments of the Laender, the Federal authorities for environment and health, the Federal Army, and the Federal Committee for Immediate Help (FKST) on Drinking Water (FKST), more than 40 sites of drinking water extraction were assessed as being acutely at risk. Since then, the interest has driven from such openly manifesting dangers to those being still unrecognised but of at least the same risk potential, called latent dangers. The significance of these military 'hangovers' is due to long-term effect chains on the soil/ground -water/drinking water path. Experts assessed, that the surface of the former GDR could comprise at least 100 out of 10. 000 objects (combined properties of WGT, NVA, bordering troops, department for security of the state and others) with potentially serious consequences for human health. The aim of the criterions catalogue is to counteract such unhealthy effects on the man prospectively. (orig.)

40|$|The {{goals of}} a {{recently}} funded project {{to measure the}} potential benefits of developing a groundwater trading market in Nebraska is discussed in this Cornhusker Economics article. Groundwater is a major component of agricultural water use. In extensive regions of the Western United States, rural agricultural economies rely entirely on groundwater. At the same time as providing water for human needs, groundwater is also an input to streams, wetlands and riparian areas that provide important ecosystem services. Ongoing groundwater pumping will deplete flows in adjacent streams, leading to potential conflict between human and environmental uses of water. In the last decades, many conflicts over transboundary allocations of <b>water,</b> <b>endangered</b> species and instream and riparian habitat have been driven by surface water-groundwater interaction. for example, claims have been filed with the United States Supreme Court over mpacts of groundeater use on flows of transboundary rivers for the Pecos River (Texas vs. New Mexico), the Arkansas River (Kansas vs. Colorado), and the Republican River (Kansas vs. Nebraska and Colorado). Groundwater has typically been viewed as private property, and its use in agriculture is generally neither regulated nor quantified precisely. However, there is growing interest in moving to systems that regulate groundwater use. The ability to trade groundwater allocations is often a part of such conversations...|$|R
