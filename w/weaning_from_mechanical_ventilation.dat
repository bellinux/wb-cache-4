The hospital {{is dedicated to the}} diagnosis, care and rehabilitation of children with complex medical and rehabilitative needs. The hospital opened a new, 56,000 square-foot inpatient hospital in December 2011. The new inpatient facility accommodates 86 patients in single or double rooms and includes a 46-bed Infant & Toddler and Post Neonatal/Post-Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for medically fragile patients, many of whom require <b>weaning</b> <b>from</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation.</b> The new building also includes a 30-bed Pediatric & Adolescent Unit, and a 10-bed Traumatic Brain Injury Unit.The hospital also has its own on-site public school district, the Mount Pleasant Blythedale Union Free School District.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{failure to}} <b>wean</b> <b>from</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> {{is related to}} worse {{outcomes}} after cardiac surgery. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether the serum level of B-type natriuretic peptide is a predictor of <b>weaning</b> failure <b>from</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> after cardiac surgery. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study of 101 patients who underwent on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. B-type natriuretic peptide was measured postoperatively after intensive care unit admission and at the end of a 60 -min spontaneous breathing test. The demographic data, hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, fluid balance, need for vasopressor or inotropic support, and length of the intensive care unit and hospital stays were recorded. Weaning failure was considered as either the inability to sustain spontaneous breathing after 60 min or the need for reintubation within 48 h. RESULTS: Of the 101 patients studied, 12 patients failed the weaning trial. There were no differences between the groups in the baseline or intraoperative characteristics, including left ventricular function, EuroSCORE and lengths of the cardiac procedure and cardiopulmonary bypass. The B-type natriuretic peptide levels were significantly higher at intensive care unit admission and at the end of the breathing test in the patients with weaning failure compared with the patients who were successfully weaned. In a multivariate model, a high B-type natriuretic peptide level at the end of a spontaneous breathing trial was the only independent predictor of <b>weaning</b> failure <b>from</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation.</b> CONCLUSIONS: A high B-type natriuretic peptide level is a predictive factor for the failure to <b>wean</b> <b>from</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> after cardiac surgery.

30|$|In summary, a high SPD {{level at}} {{baseline}} {{is associated with}} a very high absolute risk of the patient not being successfully <b>weaned</b> <b>from</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> within a month, and a high risk of dying while intubated. When adjusted for other predictors of respiratory failure, high SPD level at baseline independently predicts persistent respiratory failure during <b>mechanical</b> <b>ventilation</b> in critically ill patients. Acknowledging that ICU populations are often heterogenous and that other reasons may have accounted for some of the cases of persistent respiratory failure, we repeated all the main analyses while excluding patients with heart failure, chronic interstitial lung disease and severe neurological diseases; all these analyses confirmed the findings regarding the lung damage biomarkers.|$|R
