And now I give you in facsimile (Plate VI.) the two Aphrodites thus compared--the Aphrodite Thalassia of the Tyrrhene seas, and the Aphrodite Urania of the Greek skies. You may not at first like the Tuscan best; and why she is the best, though both are noble, again I must defer explaining to next lecture. But now turn back to Bewick's Venus, and compare her with the Tuscan Venus of the Stars, (Plate II.); and then here, in Plate VI., with the Tuscan Venus of the Seas, and the Greek Venus of the Sky.

Individuals need to manage their knowledge by correctly applying general knowledge and strategies in novel situations. However, evolution has limited the flexibility with which humans can adapt to novel situations: it takes time to acquire knowledge than can be applied successfully; moreover, the knowledge that can be applied successfully has often a limited scope. Groups need to manage the knowledge of the individual group members, or else the group succumbs to suboptimal solutions to problems. A team of experts is not by definition an expert team; procedures need to be developed to identify and use each team member's unique contribution. Finally, organizations are only able to adapt themselves to a changing environment if they are able to properly manage their employees' knowledge, <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> full circle to individuals...|$|R

She had shown him enough {{what she thought of}} it, and her forbearance pleased him; with the part of the transaction that mainly concerned her she would soon enough become acquainted, and his connexion with such values as she would then find noted could scarce help growing, as it were, still more residuary. Charming people, conscious Venice-lovers, evidently, had given up their house to her, and had fled to a distance, to other countries, to hide their blushes alike over what they had, however briefly, alienated, and over what they had, however durably, gained. They had preserved and consecrated, and she now--her part of it was shameless--appropriated and enjoyed. Palazzo Leporelli held its history still in its great lap, even like a painted idol, a solemn puppet hung about with decorations. Hung about with pictures and relics, the rich Venetian past, the ineffaceable character, was here the presence revered and served: <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our truth of a moment ago--the fact that, more than ever, this October morning, awkward novice though she might be, Milly moved slowly to and fro as the priestess of the worship. Certainly it came from the sweet taste of solitude, caught again and cherished for the hour; always a need of her nature, moreover, when things spoke to her with penetration. It was mostly in stillness they spoke to her best; amid voices she lost the sense. Voices had surrounded her for weeks, and she had tried to listen, had cultivated them and had answered back; these had been weeks in which there were other things they might well prevent her from hearing. More than the prospect had at first promised or threatened she had felt herself going on in a crowd and with a multiplied escort; the four ladies pictured by her to Sir Luke Strett as a phalanx comparatively closed and detached had in fact proved a rolling snowball, condemned from day to day to cover more ground. Susan Shepherd had compared this portion of the girl's excursion to the Empress Catherine's famous progress across the steppes of Russia; improvised settlements appeared at each turn of the road, villagers waiting with addresses drawn up in the language of London. Old friends in fine were in ambush, Mrs. Lowder's, Kate Croy's, her own; when the addresses weren't in the language of London they were in the more insistent idioms of American centres. The current was swollen even by Susie's social connexions; so that there were days, at hotels, at Dolomite picnics, on lake steamers, when she could almost repay to Aunt Maud and Kate with interest the debt contracted by the London [...] "success" [...] to which they had opened the door.|$|E

5000|$|When {{you travel}} from Gortnahoe to Glengoole {{you expect to}} find Glengoole after Ballysloe, but the {{stranger}} finds that the sign for the next village reads ‘New Birmingham’. He also finds that the village is neither New nor Birmingham. There must be history here and there is. It takes {{you back to the}} beginning of the 19th century, when the local landlord, Vere Hunt, could see great potential for the development of coal mining. The plans were to build a city for coal mining in the Slievardagh Hills. In reality it never got to the stage of full development, so you can find the remains of a gaol which never held a prisoner and the extensive diary of Vere Hunt gives a vivid account of how Glengoole got the name New Birmingham, but failed to reach its full potential.It is not the only place in the parish that got its name from another country. In the townslands of New Park and Bawnleigh we have Palatine Street, called after a province in Germany, <b>which</b> now <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> to the eighteenth century. It was Sir William Barker, the landlord in Kilcooley, who offered protection and property to some families who left the Palatine on the borders of Germany and France, settled in England and later came to New Park and Bawnlea. In the Griffith Valuations of 1850 we find that there was a Methodist Chapel and a Baptist Chapel in that area. Descendants of those families still farm those areas and form an important part of the parish and of the Church of Ireland.Not far from Palatine Street is the Wellington Monument, with the inscription [...] "Erected in August 1817 in the eightieth year of his age by Sir William Barker, in honour of his grace the duke of Wellington and of his glorious victory over the French at Waterloo on the 15th June 1815."When we stop to think about the placing of our parish on the map of Ireland you notice that it is right on the border between Munster and Leinster and it is at the end of the valley, leading from Kilkenny into the plains of Munster, a gap important for control and protection. This may be the reason why we find the ruins of a constabulary barracks at Longford Pass North or Durrihies. We are now going further back into history, because this was very likely the site of the ancient Celtic Monastery of Doire Mor, the monastery established by St. Colmán, which continued with the other Celtic Monasteries of Liath Mór, Doire na Flan and Derryvilla to serve the religious needs of the people.With the decline of the Celtic Monasteries and the arrival of the Cistercians in Ireland in the 12th century, the Cistercian Monastery of Kilcooley was established by the monks from Jerpoint in 1184. The monastery continued to prosper until the disestablishment of the monasteries by King Henry VIII in 1539. During this time there were also the Church centres of Boulick and Fennor. All the townlands were divided between those three parishes.|$|R

6000|$|The {{philological}} {{analysis of}} the name of Gladstone is attempted, with very various results, by Roth, Kuhn, Schwartz, and other contemporary descendants of the old scholars. Roth finds in [...] "Glad" [...] the Scotch word [...] "gled," [...] a hawk or falcon. He then adduces the examples of the Hawk-Indra, from the Rig Veda, and of the Hawk-headed Osiris, both of them indubitably personifications of the sun. On the other hand, Kuhn, with Schwartz, fixes his attention on the suffix [...] "stone," [...] and quotes, from a fragment attributed to Shakespeare, [...] "the all-dreaded thunder-stone." [...] Schwartz and Kuhn conclude, in harmony with their general system, that Gladstone is really and primarily the thunderbolt, and secondarily the spirit of the tempest. They quote an isolated line from an early lay about the [...] "Pilot who weathered the storm," [...] which they apply to Gladstone in his human or political aspect, when the storm-spirit had been anthropomorphised, and was regarded as an ancestral politician. But such scanty folklore as we possess assures us that the storm, on the other hand, weathered Gladstone; and that the poem quoted refers to quite another person, also named William, and probably identical with William Tell--that is, with the sun, <b>which</b> of course <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> to Roth's view of the hawk, or solar Gladstone, though this argument in his own favour has been neglected by the learned mythologist. He might also, if he cared, adduce the solar stone of Delphi, fabled to have been swallowed by Cronus. Kuhn, indeed, lends an involuntary assent to this conclusion (Ueber Entwick. der Myth.) when he asserts that the stone swallowed by Cronus was the setting sun. Thus we have only to combine our information to see how correct is the view of Roth, and how much to be preferred to that of Schwartz and Kuhn. Gladstone, philologically considered, is the [...] "hawkstone," [...] combining with the attributes of the Hawk-Indra and Hawk-Osiris those of the Delphian sun-stone, which we also find in the Egyptian Ritual for the Dead. {287} The ludicrous theory that Gladstone is a territorial surname, derived from some place ("Gledstane" [...] Falkenstein), can only be broached by men ignorant of even the grammar of science; dabblers who mark with a pencil the pages of travellers and missionaries. We conclude, then, that Gladstone is, primarily, the hawk-sun, or sun-hawk.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{patterns}} of interaction between the Aegean islands in a small scale. In addition to the larger island networks that existed in classical antiquity, like the Island District in the Athenian Tribute Lists, we also encounter smaller patterns of interaction between neighbouring islands. The island of Heracleia, to the south east of Naxos, produced a unique document in the third century: it is a legislative text which prohibited the entering of goats on the island. It will be argued that this unique document was the result of attempts to use Heracleia as a goat island, that is an island used as pasture land for goats. Goat islands, in fact, will be viewed here as an expression of the theme of connectivity in the Aegean. Uninhabited islands were often used as grazing territory by neighbouring islands, a practice <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the topic of mini island networks. Mini networks also took the form of a larger island controlling its smaller neighbours, like the incorporation and subjugation of the neighbouring islands of Rhodes to the Rhodian demes, or the incorporation of Calymnos into Cos. Finally, the interesting phenomenon of synteleiai in the Athenian Tribute Lists is examined as another indication of small scale interaction...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Engineering is an {{interdisciplinary}} area, where interaction of technical and socio-economic dimensions continuously {{occurs in the}} professional practice. The ethical aspects {{of the relationships between}} engineers and society have been particularly emphasized in the recent years. In fact, the main engineering societies set up their own codes of ethics and many engineering departments worldwide introduced engineering ethics in their curricula. After introducing the concept of professional ethics and its connection with the deontological codes of professional orders, this topic will be considered in close relation to the profession of engineering and with particular attention to the energetic and environmental issues. This not only in order to give an account of professional codes, but more over to highlight how professional ethics includes {{and at the same time}} goes beyond them. Professional codes derive from two features of the profession: autonomy and self-regulation. One of the main aims of the codes is to regulate the asymmetrical relationship between professional and client in order to maintain the fiduciary nature of this relationship. This is highlighted through the analysis of two professional engineering codes. The ethical dimension helps revitalize and give meaning to professional codes and law: if a good professional life is to be conducted, it is necessary to combine the use of legal and professional guidance with an ethical structure, <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the huma...|$|E

40|$|Architecture {{is capable}} of immortalizing the {{transformation}} {{of a series of}} fragments into a whole, and this would be what I called the scenographic architecture. The research that followed was based on this speculation and tried to immortalize my own experience of a specific peripheral condition in Brussels. This stage led, through various experiments to a coherent mapping according to the personal fascination and the studio’s methodology. Eventually, it helped defining a set of design tools that coagulated in a design method that I considered {{it has the potential to}} refine into a design. Thus, I tested this method at three different scales: furniture, architectural and urban scale. The way the process of testing evolved was very much based on a non-linear approach, and finally, two of the scales merged (the urban and architectural). Naturally, a new set of contextual constraints helped coagulating on one hand, a local urban strategy for that specific Brussels condition, and on the other hand, the urban strategy led to the integration of the architectural scale. Finally I chose to focus and detail the architectural scale. The final design has taken the form of a house for an artistic community of 8 - 10 persons. Within my proposal, the notion of the house was reinterpreted according to a set of implications of the used design method. The reason for which I chose to design a house is partly rooted in the fascination of working with contrasting elements. In this case the contrasts or almost conflictual conditions are prefigured on one hand by the unconventionality of the spatial language and the fundamental aspects of the house. My final challenge was to surpass the conventional way of understanding the concept of the house through design. In order to embrace this confrontation I appealed to the notion of fragmentation and to a set of scenographic tools, <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my initial statement that the scenographic architecture is the one capable of embracing the transformations of a series of fragments into a whole.

For most of the twentieth century, Eric Gill was known for his sculptures and drawings, printmaking and the iconic typeface that bears his name. But in 1989, Fiona MacCarthy's acclaimed biography of the artist - which included extensive research into Gill's private journals - revealed another side, including an incestuous relationship with his sister and the sexual abuse of two of his three daughters. Since then, it has been difficult for many to approach his art in its previous light. The Ditchling Museum Of Art And Craft mounted a major retrospective, Eric Gill: The Body, which ran from April to September 2017. This short story by Alison MacLeod, emerged from her time as one of the writers-in-residence for the exhibition. The voices sequence in the story is inspired by visitors' responses to the exhibition.

40|$|In the {{definition}} of the interventions in ancient contexts, history and project, archaeology and planning constitute open and intertwined variables, so that none of those components should be excluded, although in practice the conditions for an effective interaction is hard to be determined among those different fields of deepening. That difficulty is not only operative: in recent decades, even on a theoretical level the debate about ancient centers has lost its broadness, articulation and efficacy, often resulting in the resumption of a few and partial aspects, already formerly detailed. A case-by-case theory is now clearly prevailing, and probably that approach could be even positive, if meant as the intention of getting closer and studying a specific urban space. A major problem stands in the fact that – very often – the focus element of discussion and study is not an ancient center – considered in its entirety and meant as the field of definition of even limited and partial actions – but the single intervention, localized in a specific point and rigidly closed within its own borders. In many aspects, the dynamics of urban transformations are actually consistent with this mechanism of action: the modifications are the result of contingent programs, from time to time determining individual interventions with a more or less significant weight, in confined spots of the urban fabric. Thus should not be a surprise if the theme of the ancient centers – and even more the issue of the historical centers – has gradually lost its interest, also because of the futility manifested by planning projects and urban designs on the field. The experience of recent years confirms the inevitability of a condition that tends at tackling each time one single issue at most. In Naples, that situation really seems to constitute the only possible one: it is worth mentioning once again Giuseppe Samonà's article in "Casabella" and his brief but very clear consideration about the "rejection of plans".
