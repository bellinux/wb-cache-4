5|$|A hemlock-mixed {{hardwood}} palustrine {{forest is}} present in the vicinity of Scotch Run east of the reservoir on the stream. The forest contains wooded wetlands and vernal pools. Trees inhabiting the forest include white oak, red oak, tulip poplar, yellow birch, eastern hemlock, American beech, and red maple. Other plants in the forest include teaberry, sphagnum moss, <b>wood</b> <b>anemone,</b> false hellebore, skunk cabbage, goldthread, and sensitive fern.|$|E
5|$|Five {{species of}} shrubs {{grow in the}} {{vicinity}} of Mahoning Creek, its floodplain, and the nearby slopes: smooth alder, silky dogwood, gray dogwood, spicebush, and American elderberry. 11 herb species also grow in this location. These include skunk cabbage, bloodroot, sensitive fern, sedge, <b>wood</b> <b>anemone,</b> woolgrass, and others. There are also invasive plants such as multiflora rose, Japanese knotweed, and garlic mustard in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{silver birch}} has an open canopy which allows plenty {{of light to}} reach the ground. This allows a variety of mosses, grasses and {{flowering}} plants to grow beneath which in turn attract insects. Flowering plants often found in birch woods include primrose (Primula vulgaris), violet (Viola riviniana), bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), <b>wood</b> <b>anemone</b> (Anemone nemorosa) and wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella). Small shrubs that grow {{on the forest floor}} include blaeberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea).|$|E

50|$|The site is {{semi-natural}} woodland, {{with some}} ancient trees and others {{which have been}} recently planted. It has a varied flora, including <b>wood</b> <b>anemones,</b> <b>wood</b> spurges and primroses, and diverse birds, bats and insects.|$|R
50|$|Nearby woodlands, {{which are}} {{remnants}} of the ancient Forest of Arden provide a home for bluebells, <b>wood</b> <b>anemones</b> and <b>wood</b> sorrel.|$|R
25|$|Nova Beck {{is one of}} two streams {{that run}} through Oakwell, both running north to south. Nova Beck forms the western {{boundary}} of Nova Wood and flows through areas of wildflowers. Many of the species present such as yellow archangel, <b>wood</b> <b>anemone</b> and wild garlic are good indicators of ancient woodland. Hard shield fern, red campion and herb bennet grow in abundance.|$|E
25|$|Brackens {{substitute}} {{the characteristics}} of a woodland canopy, and are important for giving shade to European plants such as common bluebell and <b>wood</b> <b>anemone,</b> where the woodland does not exist. These plants are intolerant to stock trampling. Dead bracken provides a warm microclimate for development of the immature stages. Climbing corydalis, wild gladiolus and chickweed wintergreen also seem to benefit from the conditions found under bracken stands.|$|E
25|$|Mostly sessile oak-hornbeam woodland, {{the site}} {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of other tree and shrub species, including numerous exotics planted when the wood included parts of large gardens. The flora includes numerous indicators of long-established woodland; ramsons (Allium ursinum), <b>wood</b> <b>anemone</b> (Anemone nemorosa) and hairy wood-rush (Luzula pilosa). Two British woodpeckers breed, along with nuthatch, treecreeper, tawny owl, kestrel and sparrowhawk, whilst hobby bred in 2015. Invertebrates are well recorded and include the purple hairstreak, white-letter hairstreak and speckled wood butterflies, several nationally scarce bees and wasps, and stag beetles. Fungi are also well recorded and mosses include Mnium punctatum at its only known London locality.|$|E
50|$|These {{adjacent}} woods {{are mainly}} coppiced small-leaved lime, {{with a small}} stream and many flowering plants, including <b>wood</b> <b>anemones,</b> sweet violets, spurge laurel, stinking iris and early purple orchid.|$|R
50|$|The site is oak and {{hornbeam}} woodland {{mainly on}} London clay. Plants in the variable ground flora include brambles, <b>wood</b> <b>anemones</b> and bluebells. Other habitats include marshland and acidic grassland.|$|R
50|$|The wood {{is mainly}} coppiced hazel, and other tree include small-leaved lime, crab apple, oak, ash, sweet chestnut, field maple and rowan. There are {{flowering}} {{plants such as}} <b>wood</b> <b>anemones</b> and foxgloves.|$|R
500|$|Because of {{the ecology}} of the area [...] was {{designated}} as a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1952. The ground flora is indicative of the calcareous nature of the site, with dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis) being locally dominant. Many of the associated species are characteristic of ancient woodland. <b>Wood</b> <b>anemone</b> (Anemone nemorosa) and common bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) are both locally abundant. The valley of the main gorge is humid and provides ideal conditions for fungi and ferns. It contains a substantial assemblage of bryophytes with over 120 species recorded including the nationally rare Bryum canariense and the very rare Amblystegiella confervoides.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of a}} 2002 {{marketing}} campaign, {{the plant}} conservation charity Plantlife chose the <b>wood</b> <b>anemone</b> as the county flower. In 2003, an early day motion with two signatures noted that 16 May is {{the anniversary of the}} Battle of Albuera and {{in recent years has been}} celebrated as [...] "Middlesex Day", commemorating the valiant efforts of the Middlesex Regiment (the [...] "Die-hards") in that battle. The idea is to recognise and celebrate the historic county. On its creation in 1965, Greater London was divided into five commission areas for the administration of justice. One was named [...] "Middlesex" [...] and consisted of the boroughs of Barnet, Brent, Ealing, Enfield, Haringey, Harrow, Hillingdon and Hounslow. This was abolished on 1 July 2003. For genealogical research it was assigned Chapman code MDX, except for the City of London which was assigned code LND. The Royal Mail continues to designate the Surrey towns of Staines-upon-Thames, Sunbury-on-Thames, Shepperton and Ashford as Middlesex.|$|E
60|$|A fair sight was she in a robe of flame-coloured silk, with {{a collar}} of ruddy gold about her neck, bright with {{emeralds}} and rubies. More yellow was her head than the flower of the broom, {{and her skin}} was whiter than the foam of the wave, and fairer were her hands than the blossoms of the <b>wood</b> <b>anemone.</b> Four white trefoils sprang up where she trod, and therefore was she called Olwen.|$|E
50|$|This is ancient {{woodland}} {{on heavy}} clay, with mature oak and ash trees, and an understorey of hazel and field maple. The ground flora is diverse, including wild garlic, <b>wood</b> <b>anemones</b> and bluebells.|$|R
50|$|The main {{trees in}} this wood are ash and field maple, {{but there are}} also several wild service trees. Spring flowers include bluebells, <b>wood</b> <b>anemones</b> and yellow archangels, and there are birds such as fieldfares and nightingales.|$|R
50|$|As the Gaelic name implies, it is {{completely}} covered in ivy draped trees, including some wych elms. In summer {{it can be difficult}} to penetrate the interior and in spring, it is carpeted in wild garlic, wild hyacinths and <b>wood</b> <b>anemones.</b>|$|R
60|$|Early in February, {{when the}} cheerless frosts of winter seem most wearisome, the common blue violet, <b>wood</b> <b>anemone,</b> hepatica, or rock-columbine, if planted in this way, {{will begin to}} bloom. The common partridge-berry, with its {{brilliant}} scarlet fruit and dark-green leaves, will also grow finely in such situations, and have a beautiful effect. These things require daily showering to keep them fresh, and the moisture arising from them will soften and freshen the too dry air of heated winter rooms.|$|E
60|$|Who {{ever saw}} a <b>wood</b> <b>anemone</b> or a heath blossom {{in the wrong}} place? Who ever saw nettle or hemlock in a right one? And yet, the {{difference}} between flower and weed, (I use, for convenience sake, these words in their {108} familiar opposition,) certainly does not consist merely in the flowers being innocent, and the weed stinging and venomous. We do not call the nightshade a weed in our hedges, nor the scarlet agaric in our woods. But we do the corncockle in our fields.|$|E
60|$|Under the flat, bud-pointed branches, I {{pressed on}} between {{clusters}} of primrose, celandine, and wild <b>wood</b> <b>anemone,</b> {{breathing in the}} earthy freshness of grass and moss. And presently I came out between the stones and jutting roots in sight of the vacant windows. I {{stood for a moment}} confronting their black regard, then descended the knoll and was soon making myself comfortable beside the garden house. But first I managed to clamber up on a fragment of the fallen masonry and peep in at its low windows. A few dead, last-year's flies lay dry on their backs; dusty, derelict spider-webs; a litter of straw, and a few potsherds--the place was empty. But it was mine, and the very remembrance of which it whispered to me--the picture of my poor father's bedroom that night of the storm--only increased my sense of possession.|$|E
50|$|The rare plant purple {{gromwell}} {{is found}} at the site. Other flowers include; <b>wood</b> <b>anemones,</b> violets and bluebells. The presence of other plants such as herb paris and yellow archangel together with the purple gromwell, show that this wood is ancient.|$|R
5000|$|The {{woodland}} {{that surrounds}} the Grotto or [...] "Secret Spring" [...] of Polmaise Castle supports a number of woodland species such as <b>wood</b> <b>anemones,</b> <b>wood</b> sorrel and bluebells. In {{the area around the}} Grotto many towering, ‘exotic’ conifers were planted in the 1860s by the Murray family which include four Sierra Redwoods, two Coast Redwoods (which can reach over 350’ high becoming the tallest trees on Earth), Douglas-firs, and a South American Monkey-puzzle tree.|$|R
50|$|The site {{is an area}} {{of former}} sandpits which has around a mile of footpaths, woodland, an open glade and many ponds. There is a wide variety of trees, and flowers include <b>wood</b> <b>anemones</b> and bluebells. It is {{described}} by Natural England as an area of outstanding natural beauty.|$|R
6000|$|Together {{with this}} {{great source of}} pre-eminence in mass of colour, we have to {{estimate}} {{the influence of the}} finished inlaying and enamel-work of the colour-jewellery on every stone; and that of the continual variety in species of flower; most of the mountain flowers being, besides, separately lovelier than the lowland ones. The wood hyacinth and wild rose are, indeed, the only supreme flowers that the lowlands can generally show; and the wild rose is also a mountaineer, and more fragrant in the hills, while the wood hyacinth, or grape hyacinth, at its best cannot match even the dark bell-gentian, leaving the light-blue star-gentian in its uncontested queenliness, and the Alpine rose and Highland heather wholly without similitude. The violet, lily of the valley, crocus, and <b>wood</b> <b>anemone</b> are, I suppose, claimable partly by the plains as well as the hills; but the large orange lily and narcissus I have never seen but on hill pastures, and the exquisite oxalisis pre-eminently a mountaineer.[26] ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{whiteness}} {{of the white}} flower where there is any red is never unhuman, probably because a very brilliant red or rose colour on some delicate skins causes the light flesh-tints to appear white by contrast, and is the complexion known as [...] "milk and roses." [...] The apple-blossom is a beautiful example, and the beloved daisy--the [...] "wee, modest, crimson-tipped flower," [...] which {{would be so much}} less dear but for that touch of human crimson. This is the herb-Margaret of so many tender and pretty legends, that has white for purity and red for repentance. Even those who have never read these legends and that prettiest, most pathetic of all which tells of the daisy's origin, find a secret charm in the flower. Among other common examples are the rosy-white hawthorn, <b>wood</b> <b>anemone,</b> bindweed, dropwort, and many others. In the dropwort the rosy buds are seen among the creamy white open flowers; and the expression is always very marked and beautiful when there is any red or purple tinge or blush on cream-whites and ivory-whites. When we look from the dropwort to its nearest relative, the common meadow-sweet, we see how great a charm the touch of rose-red has given to the first: the meadow-sweet has no expression of the kind we are considering--no human association.|$|E
60|$|The long dry summer had come. As each fierce day {{seemed to}} burn itself out in little whiffs of pearl gray smoke on the {{mountain}} summits, and as the upspringing breeze scattered {{what might have been}} its red embers over the landscape, the green wave which, in early spring, had upheaved above Smith's grave grew sere and dry and hard. In those days, the master, strolling in the little churchyard of a Sabbath afternoon, was sometimes surprised to find a few wild flowers, plucked from the damp pine forest, scattered there, and oftener rude wreaths hung upon the little pine cross. Most of these wreaths were formed of a sweet-scented grass which the children loved to keep in their desks, entwined with the pompon-like plumes of the buckeye and syringa, the <b>wood</b> <b>anemone,</b> and here and there the master noticed the dark blue cowl of the monk's-hood or deadly aconite. One day, during a walk, in crossing a wooded ridge, he came upon M'liss {{in the heart of the}} forest, perched upon a prostrate pine, on a fantastic throne, formed by the hanging plumes of lifeless branches, her lap full of grasses and pine burrs, and crooning to the just Aristides, who sat humbly at her feet, one of the negro melodies of her younger life. It was perhaps the influence of the season, or the memory of this sylvan enjoyment, which caused Aristides, one midsummer day, to have a singular vision.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} part of Fox Reservoir, which was opened in 1888 and drained in 1943 to prevent it {{being used as a}} navigational aid for German bombers in World War II. The area was {{acquired}} by the Municipal Borough of Ealing in 1949 for public open space. Part of it is ancient woodland, and other areas are on the sloping area of the drained reservoir. It has a variety of plant species, including <b>wood</b> <b>anemones,</b> <b>wood</b> avens and garlic mustard.|$|R
50|$|Sourland Mountain {{is in the}} Northeastern coastal forests {{ecoregion}} It is {{an environmentally}} sensitive area and is home to several rare and threatened plants and animals, including: trout lilies, <b>wood</b> <b>anemones,</b> ginseng, spotted salamander, pileated woodpecker, bobcat, wood turtle, barred owl, bobolink, Cooper's hawk, grasshopper sparrow, Savannah sparrow, upland sandpiper, and the scarlet tanager.|$|R
50|$|Gwen and Vera's Fields {{support an}} {{abundant}} population of wild daffodils amongst other species. <b>wood</b> <b>anemones</b> are also abundant, {{moving into the}} fields from the adjacent woodland.

There {{was something in the}} odd association of this noxious plant with these memorials which occasioned a painful sensation to the master deeper than his esthetic sense. One day, during a long walk, in crossing a wooded ridge he came upon Mliss {{in the heart of the}} forest, perched upon a prostrate pine on a fantastic throne formed by the hanging plumes of lifeless branches, her lap full of grasses and pine burrs, and crooning to herself one of the Negro melodies of her younger life. Recognizing him at a distance, she made room for him on her elevated throne, and with a grave assumption of hospitality and patronage that would have been ridiculous had it not been so terribly earnest, she fed him with pine nuts and crab apples. The master took that opportunity to point out to her the noxious and deadly qualities of the monkshood, whose dark blossoms he saw in her lap, and extorted from her a promise not to meddle with it as long as she remained his pupil. This done--as the master had tested her integrity before--he rested satisfied, and the strange feeling which had overcome him on seeing them died away.|$|E
60|$|I. Among {{the hours}} {{of his life to}} which the writer looks back with {{peculiar}} gratitude, as having been marked by more than ordinary fulness of joy or clearness of teaching, is one passed, now some years ago, near time of sunset, among the broken masses of pine forest which skirt the course of the Ain, above the village of Champagnole, in the Jura. It is a spot which has all the solemnity, with none of the savageness, of the Alps; where {{there is a sense of}} a great power beginning to be manifested in the earth, and of a deep and majestic concord in the rise of the long low lines of piny hills; the first utterance of those mighty mountain symphonies, soon to be more loudly lifted and wildly broken along the battlements of the Alps. But their strength is as yet restrained; and the far-reaching ridges of pastoral mountain succeed each other, like the long and sighing swell which moves over quiet waters from some far-off stormy sea. And there is a deep tenderness pervading that vast monotony. The destructive forces and the stern expression of the central ranges are alike withdrawn. No frost-ploughed, dust-encumbered paths of ancient glacier fret the soft Jura pastures; no splintered heaps of ruin break the fair ranks of her forests; no pale, defiled, or furious rivers rend their rude and changeful ways among her rocks. Patiently, eddy by eddy, the clear green streams wind along their well-known beds; and under the dark quietness of the undisturbed pines, there spring up, year by year, such company of joyful flowers as I know not the like of among all the blessings of the earth. It was Spring time, too; and all were coming forth in clusters crowded for very love; there was room enough for all, but they crushed their leaves into all manner of strange shapes only to be nearer each other. There was the <b>wood</b> <b>anemone,</b> star after star, closing every now and then into nebulæ: and there was the oxalis, troop by troop like virginal processions of the Mois de Marie, the dark vertical clefts in the limestone choked up with them as with heavy snow, and touched with ivy on the edges--ivy as light and lovely as the vine; and ever and anon, a blue gush of violets, and cowslip bells in sunny places; and in the more open ground, the vetch, and comfrey, and mezereon, and the small sapphire buds of the Polygala Alpina, and the wild strawberry, just a blossom or two, all showered amidst the golden softness of deep, warm, amber-colored moss. I came out presently on the edge of the ravine; the solemn murmur of its waters rose suddenly from beneath, mixed with the singing of the thrushes among the pine boughs; and, on the opposite side of the valley, walled all along as it was by grey cliffs of limestone, there was a hawk sailing slowly off their brow, touching them nearly with his wings, and with the shadows of the pines flickering upon his plumage from above; but with a fall of a hundred fathoms under his breast, and the curling pools of the green river gliding and glittering dizzily beneath him, their foam globes moving with him as he flew. It would be difficult to conceive a scene less dependent upon any other interest than that of its own secluded and serious beauty; but the writer well remembers the sudden blankness and chill which were cast upon it when he endeavored, in order more strictly to arrive at the sources of its impressiveness, to imagine it, for a moment, a scene in some aboriginal forest of the New Continent. The flowers in an instant lost their light, the river its music[15]; the hills became oppressively desolate; a heaviness in the boughs of the darkened forest showed how much of their former power had been dependent upon a life which was not theirs, how much of the glory of the imperishable, or continually renewed, creation is reflected from things more precious in their memories than it, in its renewing. Those ever springing flowers and ever flowing streams had been dyed by the deep colors of human endurance, valor, and virtue; and the crests of the sable hills that rose against the evening sky received a deeper worship, because their far shadows fell eastward over the iron wall of Joux and the four-square keep of Granson.|$|E
