5|$|The Pegasus {{turbofan}} jet engine, {{developed in}} tandem with the P.1127 then the Harrier, was designed specifically for V/STOL manoeuvring. Bristol Siddeley developed it from their earlier conventional Orpheus turbofan engine as the core with Olympus compressor blades for the fan. The engine's thrust is directed through the four rotatable nozzles. The engine is equipped for <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> to increase thrust and takeoff performance in hot and high altitude conditions; in normal V/STOL operations the system would be used in landing vertically with a heavy weapons load. The <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> function had originally been added following the input of US Air Force Colonel Bill Chapman, who worked for the Mutual Weapons Development Team. <b>Water</b> <b>injection</b> was necessary in order to generate maximum thrust, if only for a limited time, and was typically used during landing, especially in high ambient temperatures.|$|E

40|$|Most women {{experience}} pain during labour. Complementary pain relief {{methods such as}} sterile <b>water</b> <b>injections</b> and acupuncture are two alternatives for the child birthing women. The {{lack of knowledge about}} the use of these methods in clinical practice creates the need to develop and evaluate them. Aims and methods: To elucidate whether the new subcutaneous method of administering sterile water, as well as the previously described intracutaneous injection method, were effective for the relief of labour pain. Ninety-nine women in labour were randomized to either intracutaneous-, subcutaneous <b>injections</b> of sterile <b>water</b> or to placebo (Paper I). To investigate if there was any difference in perceived pain between the intracutaneous and subcutaneous techniques during <b>injection</b> of sterile <b>water.</b> One hundred female volunteers were given injections with both techniques in a cross-over trial (Paper II). To elucidate the clinical use of acupuncture and sterile <b>water</b> <b>injections</b> as pain relief and relaxation during childbirth in Swedish delivery wards. Five hundred and sixty-five midwives answered a questionnaire about their use of these methods (Paper III). To elucidate if there were any differences between acupuncture and sterile <b>water</b> <b>injections</b> in terms of pain relief and relaxation during labour. One hundred and twenty-eight pregnant women in childbirth were randomized to either sterile <b>water</b> <b>injections</b> or acupuncture (Paper IV). Results: Paper I: VAS pain scores were significantly lower in both treatment groups 10 minutes (p= 0. 001) and 45 minutes (p= 0. 005) after treatment, compared with the placebo group. Paper II: subcutaneous injections were still perceived as less painful than intracutaneous injections after trial, day and injection location were taken into consideration (p< 0. 001). Paper III: the midwives’ estimated frequency of administration of acupuncture was much higher than that of sterile <b>water</b> <b>injections,</b> 25 % versus 2 %. The intracutaneous injection technique was more common in clinical practice than the subcutaneous technique. Sterile <b>water</b> <b>injections</b> were used exclusively for pain relief during labour while acupuncture was used for both pain relief and relaxation during labour. Paper IV: women given sterile <b>water</b> <b>injections</b> experience significantly less labour pain and a higher degree of relaxation in labour, compared to women given acupuncture (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: The results indicate that the subcutaneous injection technique is preferable when using sterile <b>water</b> <b>injections</b> for low back pain during labour. Sterile <b>water</b> <b>injections</b> seem to provide more pain relief and a higher degree of relaxation, compared to acupuncture. However, acupuncture is a more common pain relief method in clinical practice.

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} work {{examined the effects}} of formation water, Sea <b>water</b> and <b>Injection</b> <b>water</b> on the rheological properties of crude oil from an off- shore field in the Niger-Delta area of Nigeria. Flow properties analyses were determined at ambient temperature (770 F) and reservoir fluid critical Temperature (1770 F). Analysis of the mixture of the crude oil and water samples were carried out at various ratios of (80 / 20 and 50 / 50) % respectively. Test results indicated that the addition of water to crude oil sample increased the values of most of the flow properties at both ambient and critical temperatures. However some crude oil flow properties like (Viscosity, pH, Density, Specific gravity and Electrical conductivity) showed the highest incremental values with formation water sample than in Sea <b>water</b> and <b>Injection</b> <b>water</b> samples at both ambient and formation temperature. At 80 / 20 ratio the viscosity of crude oil increased from 3. 8 cst to 4. 2 cst with the addition of formation water, 4. 0 cst and 3. 9 cst with sea <b>water</b> and <b>injection</b> <b>water</b> samples respectively, the values for 50 / 50 ratio gave 4. 5 cst, 4. 2 cst and 4. 0 cst for formation, sea and <b>injection</b> <b>water</b> samples respectively at ambient temperature. At 80 / 20 ratio, the pH of the crude oil sample increased from 4. 58 to 5. 20 on addition of formation water, 4. 90 and 4. 60 with sea and <b>injection</b> <b>water</b> samples respectively, the values for 50 / 50 ratios were 7. 9, 6. 5 and 5. 2 for formation <b>water,</b> seawater and <b>injection</b> <b>water</b> samples respectively at ambient temperature. The specific gravity at 80 / 20 ratio increased from 0. 788 to 0. 816, 0. 806 and 0. 797 on dilution with formation, sea and <b>injection</b> <b>water</b> samples respectively, the 50 / 50 ratio gave 0. 993, 0. 966 and 0. 953 for formation water, sea <b>water</b> and <b>injection</b> <b>water</b> respectively at ambient temperature.

After making her way to Halifax by early February, she sailed on 9 February {{as a part of}} Convoy HX-108, but dropped out and joined up with Convoy SC-22, a slower convoy that had left Halifax a day earlier. Off the Northern Ireland coast, the convoy escorts broke off and Empire Simba and three other ships sailed into the Irish Sea. Headed to her {{destination}} of Port Talbot, Empire Simba was {{at the back of the}} line of the four ships. At 1300 hrs on 1 March, a Heinkel He 111 bomber of Kampfgeschwader 27, Luftwaffe attacked the column, and had a near miss on Empire Simba. The force of the explosion shattered the main <b>water</b> <b>injection</b> pipe in the engine room, flooding her engine room and leaving the ship dead in the water. The German bomber, with smoke trailing from it after being hit by bullets from one of Empire Simbas two Hotchkiss Mark I machine guns, headed off for Ireland. There were no towing vessels immediately available for Empire Simba, so as darkness approached, Empire Simbas crew abandoned the ship for the escorting trawler. Taking the ship's two machine guns, the chronometer, and some personal belongings, the crew were landed at Milford Haven. Empire Simba was saved and towed into Birkenhead, where the officers rejoined with their erstwhile ship. During an overnight bombing raid on the night of 12/13 March, German bombers parachuted land mines on Birkenhead. One landed on Empire Simba and exploded, causing significant damage to the ship.|$|E

40|$|Background: About 30 % {{of women}} in labour suffer from lower back pain. Studies of sterile <b>water</b> <b>injections</b> for {{management}} of low back pain have consistently shown this approach to be effective. The objective of this evidence-based guide is to facilitate the clinical use of sterile <b>water</b> <b>injections</b> to relieve lower back pain in labouring women. Methods: To identify relevant publications our search strategy was based on computerised literature searches in scientific databases. The methodological quality of each study was assessed using the {{modified version of the}} Jadad scale, 12 studies were included. Findings: Recommendations regarding the clinical use of sterile <b>water</b> <b>injections</b> for pain relief in labour are reported in terms of the location of injection administration, various injection techniques, number of injections used, amount of sterile <b>water</b> in each <b>injection</b> and adverse effects. Discussion: Both injection techniques provide good pain relief for lower back pain during labour. The subcutaneous injection technique is possibly less painful than the intracutaneous technique administered, but we are unsure if this impacts on effectiveness. The effect seems {{to be related to the}} number of injections and the amount of sterile <b>water</b> in each <b>injection.</b> Conclusion: The recommendation at present, based on the current state of knowledge, is to give four injections. Notwithstanding the differences in injection technique and number of injections the method appears to provide significant levels of pain relief and can be repeated as often as required with no adverse effect (apart from the administration pain) on the woman or her foetus...|$|R
