40|$|Biological invasions can {{markedly}} {{influence the}} biodiversity of marine fouling communities and cause considerable economic damage. Ship hulls and ballast water tanks are possible vectors for the dispersal of invasive species. The number of invasions facilitated by these vectors {{is expected to}} increase due to the expansion of shipping routes and {{an increase in the number}} of ocean-going ships. In this context, little is known about the invasion ecology of entire fouling communities consisting of macroalgae and macroinvertebrates. It is also not fully understood how the age of a community influences its stability towards environmental change. The longer introduced communities persist after a transport, the more likely it is that single species reproduce and release propagules, which could initiate a new invasion. To investigate this subject, an experiment was conducted using natural fouling assemblages. I translocated fouling assemblages, differing in species richness and composition, between two shallow, sub-tidal habitats on the north-east coast of England. In this study, assemblage age was experimentally manipulated at two levels: I let fouling organisms establish on settlement panels for 2 months and 8 months, respectively. The same experiment was repeated during a different season with 2 month and 4 month old assemblages. The community dynamics were observed over a period of 18 weeks after translocation. At the one site, Bugula angustiloba, Ascidiella aspersa, Ciona intestinalis, Botryllus schlosseri and Didemnum spp from the introduced assemblages temporarily invaded the resident assemblages, despite high levels of environmental stress. I assume that a low productivity of the recipient site and large amounts of available settlement substrata present in the resident communities, the species identity of the introduced species (e. g. short larval dispersal), their repeated introduction during the second experiment were responsible for facilitating the transient establishment of the introduced species. At the other site, the introduced assemblages underwent a process of structural convergence towards resident assemblages after transplantation. Based on the data obtained from the experiment, I calculated the convergence rates between resident and translocated communities. Generally, older, species-rich assemblages showed slower rates of convergence than younger, less rich assemblages. Intrinsic characteristics of the assemblages at the time of transplantation, such as diversity, species identity and the amount of available settlement substrata were considered as possible determinants of the convergence rate. In this context, the influence of diversity on community stability has been controversially discussed for several years. Different diversity measures (Species Richness, Shannon- <b>Weaver</b> <b>index,</b> and functional diversity) were correlated with the convergence rate i. e. community stability towards environmental change. Shannon <b>Weaver</b> <b>index</b> was the only diversity measure that was significantly negatively correlated with the convergence rate of both experiments. This correlation between Shannon <b>Weaver</b> <b>index</b> and community stability may be considered as a “sampling effect”. The more species are present in a community the higher is the probability that species that stabilise the community are present. The availability of settlement substrata was significantly positively correlated with the convergence rate. In conclusion, species identity, diversity and available settlement space are good stability predictors. As a practical implication for the control of bio- invasions I recommend the frequent cleaning of ship hulls and cleaning of oil platforms before transport as fully matured fouling communities have a high potential to initiate invasion...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Muskegon Lake was {{designated}} an Area of Concern because of severe environmental impairments from direct discharge {{of industrial and}} municipal wastes. Since diversion of all municipal and industrial wastewater in 1973, few studies have assessed ecological changes associated with improved water quality. We examined distributions and long-term changes in the benthic macroinverte-brate community at 27 sites. Distributions were evaluated relative to distance from the river mouth, water depth, grain size, and known areas of sediment contamination. Temporal changes were assessed relative to wastewater diversion. Oligochaeta and Chironomidae dominated the community, and the oligochaete trophic condition index indicated that, in 1999, the lake was generally mesotrophic to eutrophic. Cluster analysis resulted in four distinct site groupings. A cluster of sites near the river mouth had the highest total density (9, 375 m– 2) and lowest diversity (Shannon <b>Weaver</b> <b>Index</b> 1. 05) suggesting an enriched habi-tat. A site cluster in the south central region had the lowest oligochaete density (2, 782 m– 2), lowest oligochaete trophic condition index scores (1. 00), and highest diversity (2. 24), suggesting the best habi-tat. The chironomid community in this site cluster was dominated by predatory species, possibly resulting from high concentrations of heavy metals at some sites.

Short fallow and secondary forest were used as treeless and forest references. The numbers and diversities of soil vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi on 60 cocoa producing farms in the Central province of Cameroon were assessed based on the classical morphotyping of spore morphology. We also observed the soil organic matter, nitrogen and major soil nutrients. VAM spore density was significantly lower in the young cocoa agroforests (16 spores g- 1 dry soil) than in the old cocoa agroforests (36 spores g- 1 dry soil). Levels in the nearby secondary forest (46 spores g- 1 dry soil) were not significantly different from old cocoa.

The average concentration of key eutrophication indexes (i. e., total phosphorous (TP: 0. 24 ± 0. 11 mg·L− 1), total nitrogen (TN: 2. 96 ± 1. 60 mg·L− 1), and Chlorophyll a (Chl a: 38. 5 ± 11. 5 mg·m− 3)) substantially exceeded threshold values for eutrophic streams. Moreover, the eutrophication increased significantly downstream along the river reservoir {{as a consequence of}} an increasing fraction of agricultural and industrial land-use in the watershed. 103 phytoplankton species were identified, of which Chlorophyta was the dominated phylum (47 species), followed by Bacillariophyta (23 species) and Cyanophyta (18 species). No spatial difference in species distribution (ANOVA, p > 0. 05) were found, while the temporal differences in species composition exhibited significant heterogeneity (ANOVA, p < 0. 001). Phytoplankton abundance was highest in early summer (June and July), with maximum values increasing from 1. 78 × 108 and 2. 80 × 108 cells·L− 1 in upstream and middle reaches, respectively, to 4. 18 × 108 cells·L− 1 furthest downstream. Cyanophyta, also known as Cyanobacteria and commonly referred to as blue-green algal, are known to constitute algae bloom in eutrophic systems. Common species are Microcystis marginata, Microcystis flos-aquae, and Oscillatoria sp. This was the dominant phyla during summer months, especially in the middle and lower reaches of the stream reservoir where it accounted for 88. 9 % of the phytoplankton community.

40|$|This study {{addressed}} {{the question whether}} the stability of marine fouling communities towards environmental changes is predictable by their age. If a marine fouling community is transported into a new habitat on a drifting object, the introduced community needs to cope with both: changes in abiotic conditions and the recruitment of local species at the new site to persist. If introduced communities persist for a long time, this enhances the risk that single species spread and/or reproduce, what can finally lead to a successful invasion. I investigated the 2 nd step of the invasion pathway: the persistance of a marine fouling community after transport into a new environment. For this, I used marine fouling communities that established on artificial, vertically orientated, settlement substrata at two different study sites in the South China Sea. The sites differed in both abiotic and biotic conditions. At both sites two sets of communities established for 4 months and 2 months. Half of the replicated communities of each age were transplanted to the other study site and were paired statistically and spatially with a community {{of the same age}} (acting as a local reference community) that established at the recipient site. After the transplantation the communities were sampled biweekly for 8 weeks. At each sampling event I estimated the abundance (percent cover) of each macrofouler species. For both successional stages, I clearly observed a convergence process between transplanted and nontransplanted communities. On the base of the obtained data, I calculated the Bray-Curtis similarity between native and transplanted communities and derived the convergence rate over time. I found that community age is significantly affecting the rate of convergence between native and introduced assemblages. I related these findings to intrinsic communitiy properties, namely diversity, available settlement substratum and species identity. The influence of diversity on community stability has been controversially discussed for several decades. In my study, different diversity measures (Shannon- <b>Weaver</b> <b>index,</b> species number and functional richness) were correlated with the speed of convergence between transplanted and non-transplanted communities, i. e. community stability towards environmental change. All taxonomic diversity measures were poor predictors of stability. However, functional richness was the only diversity measure that significantly affected the convergence speed. On contrast, the functional identity, life strategy, and species identity were good stability predictors. The question is whether this correlation between functional richness and stability has to be considered as a “functional sampling effect”. In conclusion, the functional identities or the life strategies of the species in the community are better stability predictors than the tested taxonomic diversity measures. I will discuss the role of available settlement substratum, diversity, and the different functional traits in theobserved convergence process towards the resident communities...|$|E

Seven satellite lakes and the eastern end of the main Lake Kyoga adjacent to these minor lakes were surveyed over a two-year period for fish species diversity. A total of 68 fish species were recorded of which 41 were haplochromines. Almost all the native non cichlids which occurred in the main lakes (Victoria and Kyoga) before the Nile perch upsurge recorded. Lakes Nawampasa, Gigati, Kawi, Agu and Nyaguo had the highest fish species and trophic diversity. The trophic diversity of haplochromines (based on Shannon <b>Weaver</b> <b>Index)</b> was highest in Lake Nawampasa (1. 28), followed by Gigati (1. 25), Kawi (1. 18), Agu (0. 8), Lemwa (0. 81), Nyaguo (0. 35) and was lowest in the main Lake Kyoga. Potential threats to these lakes were from collectors of ornamental fish species, especially the haplochromines, the spread of the predatory Nile perch and the water hyacinth, which are already in Lake Kyoga, and the destruction of macrophytes through harvesting of papyrus and reclamation for agriculture. The human population around these lakes harvested the fishes for food but the levels of exploitation were still low because the lakes were adjacent to main Lake Kyoga, the major supply of fish. Ornamental fish dealers were encouraged to start captive breeding of the fish for export to reduce pressure on the lakes and demonstrations for breeding were set up at FIRI in Jinja. Meetings and seminars were held with some of the communities living around the lakes sampled and the importance of fish species found in these lakes and the dangers of destructive practices discussed. Representatives of all taxa of fish caught from the lakes were preserved, catalogued and stored in the FIRI Museum. Results from this survey support the motion that these satellite lakes are important refugia for endemic diversity. Based on survey, we recommend that SaIne of these lakes like Nawampasa, Gigati, Kawi, Agu and Nyaguo could be designated as conservation areas of species threatened in the main lakes. One of the factors that seem to have prevented the spread of Nile perch into Kyoga Minor lakes seems to have been the presence of extensive swamps around these lakes and the low oxygen levels that exist in these habitats. Clearing of swamps and vegetation that separate Kyoga minor lakes from the main lake should be avoided to prevent Nile perch from spreading into these lakes...|$|E
40|$|Cultivation-independent genomic {{approaches}} have greatly advanced {{our understanding of}} the ecology and diversity of microbial communities involved in biodegradation processes. However, much still needs to be resolved in terms of the structure, composition and dynamics of the microbial community in impacted ecosystems. Here we report on the RNA activity of the microbial community during the bioremediation process using RNA Temperature Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (RNA-TGGE). Dendrograms constructed from similarity matching data produced from the TGGE profiles separated a community exhibiting high remediation potential. Overall, increased Shannon <b>Weaver</b> Diversity <b>indices</b> (1 – 2. 4) were observed in the high potential remediation treatment samples. The functionality of the microbial community was compared, with the microbial community showing the greatest organisation also showing the highest levels of hydrocarbon degradation. Subsequent sequencing of excised bands from the microbial community identified the presence of Gammaproteobacteria together with a number of uncultured bacteria. The data shows that RNA TGGE represents a simple, reproducible and effective tool for use in the assessment of a commercial bioremediation event, in terms of monitoring either the natural or augmented hydrocarbon-degrading microbial community...|$|R

This poster reports the results achieved assessing biodiversity using landscape structural indicators. The main objective was to identify the landscape measures having a greater influence on the presence of avian communities in agrosystems located around Évora (South of Portugal). Birds were sampled along transects representing the different land use patterns occurring within the study area. Land use types/vegetation cover were mapped within buffers around those transects. The landscape indicators applied to each buffer are Shannon & <b>Weaver’s</b> Diversity <b>Index</b> (H’) (1962) for habitats biodiversity, Modified Simpson’s Index (E) (Romme & Knigth, 1982) for habitats heterogeneity, and organization pattern (D 1) (O’Neill et al. 1988). Avian diversity was also measured using the Simpson’s index. ArcView software was used to map the land cover features and to calculate the values for the selected indices. The relation between the avian communities present and its attributes with the different landscape measures was analysed with multivariate statistics tools...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to enrich}} the {{standard}} toolbox for measuring diversity in economics. In so doing, we compare the indicators of diversity used by economists with those used by biologists and ecologists. Ecologists and biologists are concerned about biodiversity: the diversity of organisms that inhabit a given area. Concepts of species diversity such as alpha (diversity within community), beta (diversity across communities) and gamma (diversity due to differences among samples when they are combined into a single sample) have been developed (Whittaker, 1960). Biodiversity {{is more complex than}} just the species that are present, it includes species richness and species evenness. Those various aspects of diversity are measured by biodiversity indices such as Simpson’s Diversity Indices, Species Richness <b>Index,</b> Shannon <b>Weaver</b> Diversity <b>Indices,</b> Patil and Taillie Index, Modified Hill’s Ratio. In economics, diversity measures are multi-faceted ranging from inequality (Lorenz curve, Gini coefficient, quintile distribution), to polarisation (Esteban and Ray, 1994; Wolfon, 1994, D’Ambrosio (2001)) and heterogeneity (Alesina, Baqir and Hoxby, 2000). We propose an interdisciplinary comparison between indicators. We review their theoretical background and applications. We provide an assessment of their possible use according to their specific properties. Diversity, Growth, Knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Stable isotope probing (SIP) is an {{established}} technique {{that can be}} applied to identify the metabolically active micro-organisms within a microbial population. The SIP method utilises an isotopically-labelled substrate and PCR techniques to discern the members of a microbial community that incorporate the isotope into their DNA or RNA. The current literature gap around using ¹⁵N isotopes with RNA-SIP offers real potential and advantages for targeting and identifying active members from mixed communities involved in global biogeochemical nitrogen cycling. This study specifically investigated whether nitrogen based compounds ncan be used as substrates in RNA-SIP methodologies and whether they can in turn be used to probe mixed community environments known to be actively fixing nitrogen. The nitrogen-limited systems targeted represented an ideal opportunity to assess the suitability of ¹⁵N-RNA-SIP approaches due to their known high nitrogen fixation rates. Identifying these nitrogen-fixing bacteria could provide a better representation analysis of the community, leading to an improved prediction on how to manage and optimise the treatment performance of target waste systems and to exploit the unique bioconversion properties of these types of organisms. Initially, the project undertook methodological proof of concept by using a soluble nitrogen source, ¹⁵NH₄Cl, to label the RNA of Novosphingobium nitrogenifigens and a mixed microbial community. Successful separation of the ¹⁴N- (control) and ¹⁵N-RNA was achieved for both pure and mixed communities using isopycnic caesium trifluoroacetate (CsTFA) gradients in an ultracentrifuge. The usefulness of this technique to identify active diazotrophs in real environmental samples was tested using a nitrogen-fixing community from a pulp and paper wastewater treatment system. After growing the mixed culture with ¹⁵N₂ as the sole nitrogen source, the labelled RNA was extracted and fractionated using isopycnic centrifugation in CsTFA gradients. The community composition of the active nitrogen-fixing community in the ¹⁵N₂ enriched fraction was analysed by establishing a 16 S rRNA gene clone library containing over 200 members. These were analysed by comparison with published sequences and by phylogenetic analysis. It was found that the more isotopic label substrate incorporated, the further the buoyant density (BD) separation between ¹⁵N- and ¹⁴N-RNA. Novosphingobium nitrogenifigens gave an average BD shift of 0. 03 + 0. 004 g ml⁻¹ (95. 0 atom % ¹⁵N) with ¹⁵NH₄Cl. For mixed communities the average BD shift was 0. 02 + 0. 004 g ml⁻¹ (80. 0 atom % ¹⁵N) with 15 NH 4 Cl and 0. 013 + 0. 002 g ml⁻¹ (32. 6 atom % ¹⁵N) when using ¹⁵N₂. Clone library analysis of 16 S rRNA genes present in the enriched ¹⁵N-RNA fraction of the mixed community was shown to consist of a diverse population of bacteria as indicated by a Shannon <b>Weaver</b> <b>index</b> value of > 2. 8. Three dominant genera (Aeromonas, Pseudomonas and Bacillus) were identified by comparison with published sequences and phylogenetic analysis. Many other groups not known as archetypal nitrogen-fixing bacteria were also identified, demonstrating that ¹⁵N₂-RNA-SIP provides a useful tool for the identification of important and previously unknown contributors to nitrogen fixation in a range of environments. Overall, this project has established that nitrogen based RNA-SIP is a powerful tool that can be used successfully and reproducibly with both pure and complex mixed microbial communities to study active diazotrophs in environmental samples...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Science (Water Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 Water in South Africa is {{becoming}} limiting due to economic growth, social {{development and the}} country's water demand that exceed its water availability. Water conservation in the industry {{can be accomplished by}} the reuse of process water instead of direct treatment and discharge. By reusing a process effluent as cooling water in cooling towers, the water requirements of an industry, such as Sasol, will be lower and a zero effluent discharge scenario could be achieved. At Sasol, during the gas-to-liquid (GTL) conversion process, natural gas is converted to diesel and other products. During this process an aqueous effluent stream is produced in the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) reactors known as Primary Column Bottoms. Primary Column Bottoms can be re-used as cooling water within cooling towers. Although this approach is technically feasible, the re-use of process water in cooling systems is characterised by major problems (fouling, scaling and corrosion) due to the complicated chemistry of the process water and the increased nutrient loads within the system. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the suitability of Fischer-Tropsch gas-to-liquid Primary Column Bottoms as process cooling water by analysing the microbial community dynamics, fouling, scaling and corrosion. Due to the corrosive nature of this process effluent, stabilisation of the water was essential. To determine whether efficient stabilisation was attained, an accelerated corrosion test was performed. Influence of the external operating parameters within the cooling tower on the rate of fouling, scaling and corrosion were also determined. Structural and functional diversity of planktonic and sessile communities were studied by making use of conventional microbiological techniques (plate counts, MPN technique) and molecular methods (PLFA, DGGE). The accelerated corrosion test of 28 days conducted on mild steel and stainless steel (316 L) corrosion coupons accelerated corrosion by immediately establishing the mature natural environment that causes corrosion. The test solution was stabilised as well as non-stabilised synthetic Primary Column Bottoms, in order to compare the effect of stabilisation. Scaling and corrosion indices were also calculated on stabilised and non-stabilised water to determine the scaling and corrosive tendencies of the water and how this correlates with the actual corrosion results obtained. According to the Langelier Saturation Index (LSI), Rymar Stability Index (RSI) and the Puckorius Scaling Index (PSI) the stabilised water was slightly scale forming with little corrosion and the non-stabilised water being more corrosive than scale forming. Average corrosion rate of the stabilised water was 0. 032 m d y and 0. 049 m d y for non-stabilised water. Average scaling rate was calculated as 7. 269 mg/dm 2 /d for stabilised water and 5. 853 mg/dm 2 /d for non-stabilised water. It can therefore be concluded that effective stabilisation was achieved since stabilised water was less corrosive than non-stabilised water which was also confirmed through experimental data (corrosion rates from accelerated corrosion test) and corresponded with the corrosive tendencies obtained from the scaling and corrosion indices. A lab-scale cooling tower was operated with stabilised synthetic Primary Column Bottoms as cooling water. Five experiments were conducted under varying flow rates and cycles of concentration. Influence of the external operating parameters (linear flow velocity and cycles of concentration) on fouling, scaling and corrosion rates of mild steel and stainless steel (316 L) corrosion coupons and heat exchanger tubes were determined through weight loss measurements. Routine physico-chemical analyses, EDS (energy dispersive spectrometry) microanalysis as well as scaling and corrosion indices of each experiment were also compared, in order to evaluate the influence of cycles of concentration and linear flow velocity. Based on the results obtained, it was evident that the variation in cycles of concentration and linear flow velocity had a significant effect (p 0. 05) on the fouling, scaling and corrosion rates on the mild steel corrosion coupons and heat exchanger tubes. Experimental runs operated at low flow rates of 0. 6 mIs and 0. 9 d s resulted in relative high fouling, scaling and corrosion rates. Operation at 3 and 4 cycles of concentration had the highest scaling and corrosion rates. The COD within the cooling tower was not removed by the microorganisms within the planktonic and sessile communities and resulted in a build-up of COD in the sump. Thus, the cooling tower cannot be used as a bioreactor to biologically degrade volatile organic acids and hydrocarbons. To evaluate the structural and functional diversity of the bacterial and fungal communities. plate counts, most probable number technique, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis as well as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used. According to PLFA profiles the community structure within the planktonic and biofilm samples of the experiments operated at low linear flow velocities were similar. The same percentages of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi occurred, The community structure composition of the planktonic and sessile phases in the experiments operated at higher linear flow velocities was also similar. PLFA analysis concluded that the highest estimated viable biomass was in experiment 1 which had a low linear flow velocity of 0. 6 d s. Shannon-Weaver index analysis of DGGE profiles (general structural diversity) indicated that the planktonic bacterial diversity of experiment I and 2 were the highest. Experiment I and 2 were operated at a linear flow velocity of 0. 6 and 0. 9 m/s respectively. The biofilm samples that had the highest Shannon-Weaver diversity index were experiment 1 and 5. Both experiment 1 and 5 were operated at a linear flow velocity of 0. 6 m/s. Morphological changes between planktonic and sessile communities were monitored through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM results illustrated that the planktonic and sessile microbial populations throughout the five experiments were similar, based on morphology. According to the results obtained from the MPN technique, the experiment operated at the lowest linear flow velocity had the highest numbers of sulphate reducing bacteria and also resulted in the highest corrosion rate. Both experiments that were operated at a low linear flow velocity of 0. 6 d s had the highest bacterial numbers and also resulted in high fouling rates. However, no relationship exists between the percentage increase in the numbers of aerobic bacteria and the cycles of concentration at which the cooling tower was operated. These observations are supported by results from PLFA profiles that showed that the community structure within the planktonic and sessile samples of the experiments operated at low linear flow velocities were similar. The planktonic and sessile phases of these two experiments had similar levels of Gram-positive-, Gram-negative- bacteria and fungi. The community structure composition of the planktonic and sessile phases in the experiments operated at high linear flow velocities was also similar. PLFA analysis further demonstrated that the highest estimated viable biomass was in the experiment operated at a low linear flow velocity of 0. 6 m/s. Shannon- <b>Weaver</b> <b>index</b> analysis of DGGE profiles (general structural diversity) also indicated that the planktonic bacterial diversity during operation at low linear flow velocities were the highest. Although scanning electron microscopy results illustrated that the planktonic and sessile microbial populations throughout the five experiments were generally similar. these results supported the observations of the other techniques. These techniques all supported the notion that corrosion rates may not be directly related to the total microbial biomass or the number of species on mild steel or stainless steel. Corrosion rates seem to be more profoundly affected by biofilm composition within the sessile phase. Based on the results obtained when using Primary Column Bottoms as cooling water, it were evident that variation in cycles of concentration and linear flow velocity had a significant effect (p> 0. 05) on the fouling, scaling and corrosion rates on mild steel corrosion coupons and heat exchanger tubes. Low linear flow velocities resulted in high fouling rates, increased bacterial numbers as well as high bacterial and fungal diversities. High cycles of concentration resulted in high scaling and corrosion rates and also had the result of similar community structure profiles. This research study could facilitate the selection of optimised operational parameters for the re-use of industrial process water (such as Primary Column Bottoms) as cooling water to minimise fouling, scaling and corrosion.

Eleven traits recorded high H` indicating suitability in breeding programmes. Their regression coefficients indicated positive change for six traits in dependent variable seed yield. Phenotypic correlation studies revealed that seed yield was significantly correlated to root dry weight, root diameter, plant height, node number, effective spike length and 100 seed weight. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that PC 1, 2 and 3 accounted for 44. 52, 15. 93 and 10. 54 % variation.

However, the ecological responses of various taxa to pollution are poorly known in resources-limited tropical countries. While freshwater macroinvertebrates have been used in the assessment of water quality in Europe and the Americas, investigations in Africa have mainly focused on snail hosts of human parasites. There is a need for sampling methods {{that can be used to}} assess both snails and other macroinvertebrates. The present study was designed to evaluate the usefulness of the freshwater snail dip scoop method in the study of macroinvertebrates for the assessment of the SOSUCAM sugar mill effluents pollution. Standard snail dip scoop samples were collected upstream and downstream of the factory effluent inputs, on the Mokona and Mengoala rivers. The analysis of the macroinvertebrate communities revealed the absence of Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera, and the thriving of Syrphidae in the sections of the rivers under high effluent load. The Shannon and <b>Weaver</b> diversity <b>index</b> was lower in these areas. The dip scoop sampling protocol was found to be a useful method for macroinvertebrates collection.

The underlying assumption of both these methods is that animals are constrained in the environment, {{and that it is}} possible to develop quantitative relationships between physical factors and population characteristics such as biomass or frequency of occurrence. The use of these two procedures has become widespread but concomitantly has come under increased scrutiny and criticism (3 - 5). Most individuals are willing to concede that animal populations are constrained by their environment but question the general applicability of the models developed. We reasoned that the general applicability of a model for benthic insects could be measured by the degree to which the same physical factors were correlated with population parameters in different sections of the same drainage. Forty-three single benthic samples (10 from Upper Little River, 6 from Lower Little River, 15 from Glover Creek, and 12 from Mountain Fork River) were taken from riffles with a circular depletion sampler between July 20 and August 11, 1982 and identified to family.
