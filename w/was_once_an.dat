Perhaps {{at the beginning of}} the Common Era, or possibly earlier, they came to be occupied by the Koli fishing community.|$|E

5|$|In the end, Carter won the election, {{receiving}} 50.1% of {{the popular}} vote and 297 electoral votes compared with 48.0% and 240 electoral votes for Ford.

Ford carried 27 states versus 23 carried by Carter.|$|E
5|$|Measurement of {{antioxidant}} {{content in}} food {{is not a}} straightforward process, as antioxidants collectively are {{a diverse group of}} compounds with different reactivities to various reactive oxygen species. In food science, the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) <b>was</b> <b>once</b> <b>an</b> industry standard for antioxidant strength of whole foods, juices and food additives. However, the United States Department of Agriculture withdrew these ratings in 2012 as biologically invalid, stating that no physiological proof in vivo existed to support the free-radical theory or roles for ingested phytochemicals, especially for polyphenols. Consequently, the ORAC method, derived only from in vitro experiments, is no longer considered relevant to human diets or biology.|$|E

5|$|The {{video was}} shot in one day in January 2009 in Nashville, Tennessee. Frolicking scenes between Swift and Colletti were filmed first; the lunch, outdoor, and indoor scenes followed. Coincidentally, {{on the day of}} filming, it rained heavily, {{something}} which Swift was enlightened by, since it corresponded to the video's gloomy and dark feel. Swift said it aided in making the video less colorful lighting-wise, and more fixated on muted tones. The last scenes were more difficult for Swift because they involved crying. She attributed the difficulty to the number of people surrounding her and watching, something she was not accustomed to. However, Fanjoy, who <b>was</b> <b>once</b> <b>an</b> actress, guided her into thinking about what made her most solemn, and completing the scene effectively. Fanjoy said the scenes demonstrated what an exceptional actress Swift was, adding she took direction very well. The scene took approximately three hours to film.|$|E
