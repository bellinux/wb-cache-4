This occurred {{within the framework of}} a changed international environment, from a battle between the Free World and communism, to one between nationalism and globalization. During the 1980s, Jean-Marie Le Pen complained about the rising number of [...] "social parasites", and called for deregulation, tax cuts, and the phasing-out of the welfare state. As the party gained growing support from the economically vulnerable, it converted towards politics of social welfare and economic protectionism. This was part of its shift away from its former claim of being the [...] "social, popular and national right" [...] to its claim of being [...] "neither right nor left – French!" [...] Increasingly, the party's program became an amalgam of free market and <b>welfarist</b> policies, which some political commentators have claimed are left-wing economic policies.|$|E

They reject the animal <b>welfarist</b> position that more humane treatment is needed for animals; they say their aim is empty cages, not bigger ones. Activists argue that the animals they remove from laboratories or farms are [...] "liberated", not [...] "stolen", because they were never rightfully owned in the first place.|$|E

50|$|One {{of the key}} criticisms that Francione makes of <b>welfarists</b> and new <b>welfarists</b> is that welfarism reform simply doesn’t work, and in fact {{is harmful}} to the cause as welfare reform is argued to make people more {{comfortable}} with animal exploitation, and therefore less likely to stop using animals. Welfare reform is also claimed to make the animal exploitation industry more efficient. Carcass damage occurs when food animals are improperly slaughtered and bruise themselves in their deathroes. Welfare reform to slaughter animals more humanely reduces the likelihood of this occurring, improving profits and public image for animal slaughterers.|$|R
40|$|Many environmentalists criticize as unecological the {{emphasis}} that ani-mal liberationists and animal rights theorists place on preventing animal suffering. The strong form of their objection holds that both theories ab-surdly entail {{a duty to}} intervene in wild predation. The weak form holds that animal <b>welfarists</b> must at least regard predation as bad, and that this stance reflects an arrogance toward nature that true environmentalists should reject. This paper disputes both versions of the predation critique. Animal <b>welfarists</b> are not committed to protecting the rabbit from the fox, nor do their principles implicitly deprecate nature.

5000|$|New <b>welfarists</b> {{argue that}} there is no logical or {{practical}} contradiction between abolitionism and [...] "welfarism". <b>Welfarists</b> think that they can be working toward abolition, but by gradual steps, pragmatically taking into account what most people can be realistically persuaded to do in the short as well as the long term, and what suffering it is most urgent to relieve. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, for example, in addition to promoting local improvements in the treatment of animals, promote vegetarianism. And although some people [...] may believe that changing the legal status of nonhuman sentient beings is a first step in abolishing ownership or mistreatment, there may be ample evidence {{that this is not the}} case if the consuming public has not already begun to reduce or eliminate its exploitation of animals as their own food.|$|R

New welfarists are those that argue the best path to animal rights or abolition is through welfare reform and believe that welfare reform will make humans more receptive to inherently valuing animals. Francione argues that new welfarism does not work, and actually prolongs animal exploitation. Francione describes the <b>welfarist</b> or new <b>welfarist</b> movement as simply advocating for [...] "longer chains for the slaves".|$|E

40|$|Finnish hunters, animal <b>welfarists,</b> and {{scientists}} started getting organised {{in the later}} {{half of the nineteenth}} century. In doing so, they became interest groups in wildlife conservation issues, as they began to express their views in public media. Wildlife related coverage published in relevant journals {{around the turn of the}} twentieth century shows the emergence of conservation thinking in these groups. The most profound effort was put in protection of 'small birds'; this happened due to not only their usefulness in farming but also their sheer aesthetic value. The data further showed that the dichotomising of wildlife into 'useful' and 'pest' in the contemporary law texts was not fully consistent with the public opinion at the time. During the 1890 s, all examined groups emphasised the importance of protecting certain rodent-eating raptors, but this view did not take any shape in the law reform of 1898. The emerging conservation-mindedness of these groups did not, however, apply to the most 'harmful' pests; the attitudes of, not only hunters, but also average animal <b>welfarists,</b> naturalists or professional zoologists towards many species in the pest category were not yet particularly positive at the turn of the century...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{presence}} of tradeoffs between sustainability, profitability and outreach to the poor. The study was conducted in East African using a panel data of 47 Microfinance institutions for four years period. Using <b>Welfarists</b> approach the study found out that profitability focus has a negative impact on outreach to the poor, implying the presence of tradeoffs. The results on financial sustainability did not show presence tradeoffs with the outreach measures. Under Institutionalist view, the study found out that outreach to the poor has a positive relationship with both sustainability and profitability measures. The study concludes that, the possibility of tradeoffs exists between outreach to the poor with profitability measures as compared to the outreach with financial sustainability. The presence of tradeoffs between financial performance and outreach to the poor also depends on the variables used and estimation model specification. Some variables which indicated the existence of tradeoffs under <b>Welfarists</b> views did do not show such impact under Institutionalist views. The study recommends that Microfinance institutions in East Africa should focus on financial sustainability in order to reduce their subsidy dependence, ensure survival and growth in the future.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Animal liberationists tend {{to divide}} into two {{mutually}} antagonis-tic camps: animal <b>welfarists,</b> {{who share a}} utilitarian moral outlook, and animal rightists, who presuppose a structure of basic rights. However, the gap between these groups tends to be exaggerated by their allegiance to oversimplified versions of their favored moral frameworks. For their part, animal rightists should acknowledge that rights, however basic, are also defeasible by appeals to consequences. Contrariwise, animal <b>welfarists</b> should recognize that rights, however derivative, are capable of constraining appeals to consequences. If both sides move to more defensible theoretical positions, their remaining dif-ferences on that level may be compatible with a broad area of convergence on practical issues. Key Words: animal welfare, animal rights, ethics The philosophical literature on the moral status of nonhuman animals has largely concerned itself with two issues: (1) whether (at least some) animals have moral standing, and (2) if so, what form this standing might take and what its practical implications might be. The debate on the first issue I regard as essentially over, since no one has succeeded in making a persuasive case in favour of any criterion of moral standing that will exclude all nonhuman animals from the moral domain. Some may feel that my dismissal of this issue is overhasty, if not downright dogmatic, {{but it is in}} any case not the issue I intend to address in this paper. Instead, I shall assume that at least some animals have some form of moral standing. My concern is with an intramural dispute among those who share this assumption. The notion of moral standing is (intentionally) abstract. Roughly speaking, to have (some form and degree of) moral standing is t...|$|R
40|$|This thesis reports {{original}} {{research conducted}} among grassroots {{animal rights activists}} (GARAs) in Dunedin, New Zealand. The principle finding is that GARAs are unique in that they operate according to a dual-ideology of animal and general liberation. Much {{has been written about}} animal rights activism and the animal protection movement but few differentiate branches and groups beyond the basic philosophical distinctions of <b>welfarists</b> and rightsists. This study argues that differences in the organisational, lifestyle and tactical choices of specific groups represent more than simple differences in tastes, and proposes a Six-Axis model as an appropriate tool for investigating ideological positioning that may indicate reasons for difference. Drawing on information gathered through participant-observation and in-depth interviews, this study applies the Six-Axis model and explores the experiences GARAs have in grassroots groups and with animals.

5000|$|Gary Francione, {{professor}} of law and philosophy at Rutgers School of Law-Newark, argues from the abolitionist perspective that self-described animal-rights groups who pursue welfare concerns, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, risk making the public feel comfortable about its use of animals. He calls such groups the [...] "new welfarists", arguing that, though their aim is an end to animal use, the reforms they pursue are indistinguishable from reforms agreeable to traditional <b>welfarists,</b> who he says have no interest in abolishing animal use. He argues that reform campaigns entrench the property status of animals, and validate the view that animals simply need to be treated better. Instead, he writes, the public's view that animals can be used and consumed ought to be challenged. His position is that this should be done by promoting ethical veganism. Others think that this should be done by creating a public debate in society.|$|R
