50|$|On November 7, 2009, while Hasan was communicative, {{he refused}} to talk to investigators. On November 12 and December 2, respectively, Hasan was charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of {{attempted}} murder under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, thus making him eligible for the death penalty if convicted. Although authorities did not specify at that time if they would seek the death penalty in the case, a senior military official <b>who</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> of anonymity said that Colonel Michael Mulligan would serve as the Army's lead prosecutor. Mulligan served as the lead prosecutor on the Hasan Akbar case, in which a soldier was sentenced to death for the murder of two officers.|$|E

50|$|It became {{common for}} {{observers}} {{in the late eighteenth}} century and beyond to read Donaldson, sometimes in combination with Millar, as predominating in favor of an antecedent common-law right in literary works, both before and after first publication.
