40|$|The {{substitution}} of fresh fish with frozen–thawed fish {{is a typical}} fraud that not only damages consumers from an economical point of view, but also causes safety issues. Furthermore, fish authentication is important for correct product labeling, as promoted by recent regulatory actions. In this paper, we present {{the results of the}} authentication of fresh <b>west</b> <b>African</b> <b>goatfish</b> (Pseudupeneus prayensis) fillets using different analytical technologies, namely a portable visible/nearinfrared spectrometer, a compact digital camera, and a texture analyzer. First, the classification performance of the abovementioned analytical technologies is evaluated and compared. Then, it is shown how the fusion of different technologies can be effectively used to improve the classification accuracy. Particularly, spectra and color features extracted from digital images returned a classification accuracy of 100 and 98. 5 %, respectively, when considered separately. However, the classification accuracy fell to 80 % when considering measurements taken with a 24 -h delay. Data fusion, instead, allowed a classification accuracy of 100 % also after 24 h. Hence, the combination of a spectrometer and a digital camera is very promising for cost-effective on-line/atline applications, as both sensors are rapid, non-invasive, and do not require sample preparation. Furthermore, since more than 200 samples were collected over a prolonged period of time (1 year), the classification models encompassed some sources of variability (seasonality effects and size) that are not usually accounted for in similar studies...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three experimental chapters and it {{is focused on the}} evaluation of qualitative characteristics and somatic indices of some major commercial fish and on the monitoring of purse seine fishing activity in the North West Sardinian Sea. In the first chapter the population consistency of the target specie (S. pilchardus) has been evaluated during the year 2010 purse seine fishing season in the NW Sardinian Sea. The results have been compared with those published in 2005 (year 2003 fishing season) and 2008 (year 2007 fishing season) and the variations of some characteristic chemical-nutritional factors of fish sampled in the Sardinian Sea have been evaluated during the fishing season. In the second chapter a comparison (chemical and morphometric) have been made between two different species of Mediterranean mullet of high commercial interest, the surmullet (Mullus surmuletus) and the red mullet (Mullus barbatus) with the <b>West</b> <b>African</b> <b>goatfish</b> (Pseudupeneus prayensis). The third chapter is centered on the determination of Selenium content and toxicity in several species of mugilides. At the beginning the Selenium level in wild mugilidae species, caught in costal lagoon of Sardinia, has been determined. Subsequently, one trial has been carried out to test the Selenium tendency to accumulate in flesh and organs and its influence on growing performances of small mugilidae (Liza aurata) reared in tank and fed with scalar amount of Selenium in the diet...|$|E
