5|$|Despite this, the {{defensive}} qualities of Castle Rising {{have since been}} extensively debated. The historian Robert Liddiard argues that the large windows at Castle Rising {{would have been a}} significant weakness, as it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> to fire arrows through them from the bailey, and George Garnett has questioned the utility of {{the defensive}} arrow slits, which he suggests were not well positioned or designed. The whole site was also overlooked by higher ground, which Liddiard considers would have been a key defensive weakness.|$|E

25|$|The {{observable}} stratigraphic {{record in}} the Discovery quadrangle starts with formation of the intercrater plains, parts of {{which may have been}} coeval with the oldest observable craters. During this period, rates of volcanism were probably high as heat from core formation was being dissipated. If the crust {{was in a state of}} extension, there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> pathways for large volumes of magma to reach the surface. The resulting plasticity of the crust probably caused large numbers of c1 and c2 craters to be destroyed by isostatic adjustment, so the present inventory of c1 and c2 craters may not be complete.|$|E
25|$|The {{direct cause}} of the {{accident}} is presumed to be {{the collapse of the}} vertical stabilizer. There are two alternative explanations for how the crash may have happened. The first explanation is that the lack of vertical control caused by the broken elevator torque tube stalled the aircraft. Be{{cause of the}} lack of pitch control, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> for the aircraft to fall back into a stall repeatedly, each time losing altitude. The aircraft would thus eventually have fallen into the sea. The vertical fin and rudder would have broken off on impact. This theory does not explain why the vertical stabilizer was found at such a distance from the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In August 1775, George III {{declared}} Americans in {{arms against}} royal authority to be traitors to the Crown. Following their surrender at the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777, {{there were thousands}} of British and Hessian soldiers in American hands. Although Lord Germain took a hard line, the British generals on the scene never held treason trials; they treated captured enemy soldiers as prisoners of war. The dilemma was that tens of thousands of Loyalists were under American control and American retaliation <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy.</b> The British built much of their strategy around using these Loyalists, and therefore, no Americans were put on trial for treason. The British maltreated the prisoners whom they held, resulting in more deaths to American sailors and soldiers than from combat operations. At the end of the war, both sides released their surviving prisoners.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 109th Congress, the Gang of 14 deal expired. On November 7, 2006, the Democrats retook {{control in}} the 110th Congress. Starting in January 2007, they possessed a 51-49 {{majority}} in the Senate. As the new Senate majority, the Democrats easily blocked several conservative appellate judicial nominees without resorting to the filibuster. Conservative appellate nominees like Peter Keisler, Robert J. Conrad and Steve A. Matthews were blocked in committee and never given a hearing. If a Supreme Court justice had chosen to retire during the 110th Congress, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> for the Democrats to have blocked his proposed replacement in committee, or even by a party-line vote on the Senate floor, if it somehow came to that. As it developed, no Supreme Court justice retired or died during the 110th Congress.|$|E
25|$|Ground sloths often fed in open fields. Recent {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to discover the diet of ground sloths through fossils of their dung. Analysis of these coproliths have found that ground sloths often ate the foliage of trees, hard grasses, shrubs, and yucca; these plants were located in areas that exposed them. Feeding in open areas made them susceptible to human interaction. Ground sloths were not only easy to spot, but also had never interacted with humans before. They {{did not know how}} to react to these new beings. Additionally, these large mammals waddled on their hind legs and front knuckles, keeping their claws turned in. Their movement and massive build (some weighed up to 3,000 kilograms) imply they were relatively slow mammals. These constitute intuitive reasons why ground sloths <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> prey for hunters.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the points on the {{approaches}} to Paddington did not provide 'flank protection' (where the points beyond a signal at red are set so that a train passing the signal at red is routed so as to minimise the possible consequences). This would have meant routing a train running past SN109 at red onto the Down Relief line. This should have been considered {{at the design stage}} when it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> to implement. The reasons for not doing so were not known but it was noted that the introduction of Automatic Train Protection (ATP) had been thought to be imminent. Flank protection would have increased the 'overlap' (the distance for which a train could run past the signal before fouling other lines) at SN109; the desirability of doing so should have been considered by the risk assessment which had not taken place.|$|E

25|$|Cicero {{wanted to}} pursue a public career in {{politics}} along {{the steps of the}} Cursus honorum. In 90 BC–88 BC, he served both Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo and Lucius Cornelius Sulla as they campaigned in the Social War, though he had no taste for military life, being an intellectual first and foremost. Cicero started his career as a lawyer around 83–81 BC. His first major case, of which a written record is still extant, was his 80 BC defense of Sextus Roscius on the charge of patricide. Taking this case was a courageous move for Cicero; patricide was considered an appalling crime, and the people whom Cicero accused of the murder, the most notorious being Chrysogonus, were favorites of Sulla. At this time it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> for Sulla to have the unknown Cicero murdered. Cicero's defense was an indirect challenge to the dictator Sulla, and on the strength of his case, Roscius was acquitted.|$|E

500|$|Membership {{of the new}} House of Commons was {{overwhelmingly}} made up of pro-coalition MPs, {{and there}} was therefore {{a large number of}} eligible members for the government posts to be filled. In Dutton's phrase, [...] "it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> for Dunglass to have languished indefinitely in backbench obscurity". However, Skelton, appointed as Under-secretary at the Scottish Office, offered Dunglass the unpaid post of unofficial parliamentary aide. This was doubly advantageous to Dunglass. Any MP appointed as official Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to a government minister was privy to the inner workings of government but was expected to maintain a discreet silence in the House of Commons. Dunglass achieved the first without having to observe the second. He made his maiden speech in February 1932 on the subject of economic policy, advocating a cautiously protectionist approach to cheap imports. He countered Labour's objection that this would raise the cost of living, arguing that a tariff [...] "stimulates employment and gives work [...] increases the purchasing power of the people by substituting wages for unemployment benefit".|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} RAAF's {{reorganisation}} {{following the}} outbreak of World War II in September 1939, No.2 Group was formed in Sydney on 20November; Charlesworth was appointed its Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO). He continued to serve in this position when the group was re-formed as Central Area in March 1940. Posted to Western Australia to take command of RAAF Station Pearce in August, {{he was promoted to}} temporary group captain on 1September 1940. He became Senior Administration Officer at the newly established Western Area, Perth, in January the following year. In September 1942, Charlesworth took over No.2 Bombing and Gunnery School in Sale, Victoria. He handed over to Group Captain Charles [...] "Moth" [...] Eaton in August 1943, before briefly taking charge of RAAF Headquarters Forward Echelon in Brisbane. Charlesworth was appointed Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Eastern Area, headquartered at Bradfield Park, Sydney, in December 1943. Eastern Area was responsible for maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare off the coast of New South Wales and southern Queensland. Japanese submarine activity had decreased in the months prior to Charlesworth taking command, and he was concerned that Allied ships were becoming complacent. He observed [...] "a general slackening off in procedure; ships are seldom where they should be, and a minority of merchant ships identify themselves to aircraft". The RAAF's patrols had also settled into a predictable pattern that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> for an observant submarine captain to avoid.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Grilled Cheesus", {{when members}} of the glee club are singing songs about {{religion}} and spirituality, Kurt sings The Beatles' [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand", dedicating the song to his father, who is in a coma in the hospital. Murphy stated that it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>easy</b> to have Kurt, an atheist, sing an anti-religion song, but instead chose to have him sing about love. Critics disagreed over the appropriateness of this song choice. Anthony Benigno of the Daily News said he [...] "found it particularly jarring to hear Kurt singing 'I wanna be your man' about his father", but Jessica Derschowitz of CBS News and MTV Aly Semigran enjoyed that the performance of [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] brought new meaning to the song, which Semigran named her favorite number of the episode. In [...] "Special Education", when given his first opportunity to audition for a Warblers solo, Kurt asks Rachel for advice on selecting a song and she recommends [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina" [...] from Evita; the episode cuts between the two as they each sing the song. Both Colfer's and Michele's versions were released as singles, available for digital download, although neither appears on an album. Kurt and Blaine perform the duet [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] during the Christmas-oriented episode [...] "A Very Glee Christmas". The number was released on , and although it was not also released as a single, it nevertheless reached number fifty-seven on the Billboard Hot 100. As a Dalton Academy Warbler, Kurt sings the harmony line to Blaine's lead in [...] "Animal" [...] by Neon Trees in the episode [...] "Sexy", and in [...] "Original Song" [...] he sings [...] "Blackbird" [...] by The Beatles. He also sings primary lead in a duet version of [...] "Candles" [...] by Hey Monday, with Blaine as the other lead. All three songs were included on the soundtrack , released on April 19, 2011.|$|E
