25|$|For {{the first}} time the Panorama was offered on all chassis types, {{including}} Ford R226 and Bedford VAL, looking particularly well-suited to the latter, where the chrome trim on the first window bay harmonised with the twin steering axles below. There was even a Panorama for the Bedford SB and Ford Thames 570E, although here the thickened <b>window</b> <b>pillar</b> was absent, and the chrome trim did not extend across the front of the vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|The Plaxton coach range which {{appeared}} at the 1964 Commercial Motor Show had been extensively revised with assistance from the Ogle design consultancy. Waistrails were virtually straight, and rooflines distinctly shallower. On the new Panorama (later to become Panorama I), a wide chrome trim band wrapped around the front and encompassed the first window bay on either side. The trim then swept upwards to the roof line and neatly terminated on the air scoop at the roof line. The <b>window</b> <b>pillar</b> on the first bay was noticeably thicker than the others and {{gave the impression of}} size that managed to enhance the appearance of the whole vehicle. The front grill was revised and basically split in two horizontally. Twin headlights were on each side of a panel that contained ventilation louvres at the top with the lower part being the actual grill that spanned the width of the vehicle. This grill was to become standard with little change until the Supreme IV of 1978. Again a bit of a Plaxton that was instantly recognisable and a familiar sight throughout Britain. The rear featured two large 9" [...] circular rear lights each side arranged vertically, and the entrance door was now the forward in-swinging type.|$|E

50|$|The {{distinctive}} angled <b>window</b> <b>pillar</b> bodyshell {{construction was}} previously introduced by ABB/ADtranz on the Regioshuttle.|$|E
50|$|The RS1's {{appearance}} is striking because its window design {{looks like a}} timber-framed bridge support (or Warren truss), the angled bodyshell pillars being visible at the windows. This construction was originally proposed to ABB (later ADtranz) by Design Triangle during a research study into weight reduction for high speed trains. The study, reported in a paper to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1996, showed that the diagonal pillar concept allowed mass reduction, improved passenger views and flexibility of seating layout, whilst maintaining adequate body strength and stiffness. ABB applied for a patent on the design. The Bombardier Itino uses a similar angled <b>window</b> <b>pillar</b> design. A similar <b>window</b> <b>pillar</b> design had been used on the Schienenzeppelin railcar in 1929.|$|E

50|$|The cabin {{features}} a club-seating arrangement, a toilet (or a possible seventh seat), and a baggage compartment in the pressurized area. In the cockpit, side <b>window</b> <b>pillars</b> are eliminated {{for a more}} unobstructed view for the pilot.|$|R
25|$|Trams {{were painted}} maroon lined in gold or yellow with the <b>window</b> <b>pillars,</b> rocker and upper deck {{sheeting}} in cream. The initial network {{opened with a}} fleet of 18 tram cars. By 1925 this had expanded to 42 cars.|$|R
50|$|Not {{only the}} {{community}} members were expert and specialized in stone cutting {{and construction of}} forts, palaces, temples and buildings {{but they were also}} skilled architects and artisans who could do articulate carvings of doors, <b>windows,</b> <b>pillars,</b> and statues of gods and goddesses and ceilings.|$|R
5000|$|For 1956, a two-door hardtop coupé version appeared, {{called the}} Eldorado Seville {{at which point}} the {{convertible}} was named the [...] "Eldorado Biarritz". An Eldorado script finally appeared with fender crest on the car which was further distinguished by twin hood ornaments. An extra feature on the Eldorado convertible was a ribbed chrome saddle molding extending from the windshield to the rear <b>window</b> <b>pillar</b> along the beltline. With the addition of the Seville, sales rose yet again to 6,050 of which 2,150 were Sevilles. Eldorados accounted for nearly 4% of all Cadillacs sold.|$|E
5000|$|Appleton {{spotlights}}, {{or simply}} Appletons, were a common feature in early automobiles, {{up to the}} [...] "muscle car" [...] era. The bullet-shaped spotlights (usually installed in pairs) included a handle which was mounted through the side <b>window</b> <b>pillar</b> of the cab (just above the hood) into {{the interior of the}} vehicle. This allowed an occupant to maneuver the direction or focus of the spotlight beam with a simple twisting motion. Appleton spotlights, marked with an embossed oval around the brand name, Appleton, were often found on pre-1960 vehicles (especially on service vehicles—police, armed forces, mail vehicles, etc.), but were also an often-added, after-market automobile accessory. They became so popular during the 1940s and 1950s for custom car enthusiasts, that [...] "dummy" [...] spots were commonly installed.|$|E
50|$|Like {{all other}} coachbuilders, Burlingham had a bulging order book {{at the end}} of the War, many {{operators}} having placed orders for completion as soon as peacetime conditions applied. The first post-war coach was completed in January 1946 and was very similar to the 1939 design, but featured an extra <b>window</b> <b>pillar</b> in each body side. Burlingham was justifiably cautious. as adequately seasoned timber for framing was very hard to obtain at the time. During 1946, a standard single-deck and double-deck bus body was introduced. The double-decker was basically the Ribble-type pre-war outline, whilst the single-decker could be best described as the utility frame re-clothed with traditional refinements such as compound curvature on front and rear domes and outswept skirt panels. Output of all three types was large, with many operators, such as Ribble and Walter Alexander, not only buying new chassis (for which a substantial waiting list had built up) but also sending pre-war vehicles to Burlingham for new bodies.|$|E
25|$|For the 1961 {{coaching}} {{season the}} Consort IV {{evolved into the}} Embassy, the main change being that the windows now tapered inwards towards the roof rather than being vertical. At {{the same time a}} new version of the Panorama was created, using the same shell as the Embassy but with fewer <b>window</b> <b>pillars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{modifications}} is a [...] "chopped top". The trend began in the 1950s, and is not limited to three-windows by any means. It involves cutting the <b>window</b> <b>pillars</b> and removing a section to lower the roof height, to make the car look better (in the opinion of the customizer). The process requires new glass, relocation of upper door hinges, and raked (tilted back) A-pillars to meet the roof of the car.|$|R
50|$|The smaller {{size of the}} Pendolino windows has {{attracted}} comment and, in fact, the window size is unprecedented for British railway rolling stock. The wider <b>window</b> <b>pillars</b> mean that in some standard class carriages, 22.5% of the seats are parallel with either no window or only a limited portion of one, however the roll-over strength of the bodyshell was commented on regarding the crashworthiness performance of the train in the RAIB Accident Report into the derailment at Grayrigg.|$|R
5000|$|The {{platform}} base {{moved from}} the Fiat Punto to the less costly Fiat Mini platform, {{the same as the}} Fiat 500 and Panda. Production was moved to Fiat's Tychy plant. Production reached 100,000 units per year at full capacity. The front suspension continued with independent wheel MacPherson struts at the front and the semi independent torsion beam with stabilizer bar at the rear. Much of the style echoed the Lancia Ardea, such as the [...] "flying bridge" [...] (the waist line that goes through the rear <b>window</b> <b>pillar),</b> which are inspired by the Lancia Delta third series.The Ypsilon Type 846 received investment of [...] (150 for development, 40 for the industrial structure and the remainder for production). The body is 3.84 meters long with a wheelbase of 2.39 meters. The cabin is approved for 5 seats. At the launch up to 600 possible customization combinations with 16 exterior colors (including 4 B-color version).|$|E
50|$|In 1955 the grille was {{redesigned}} with wider {{spaces between}} the blades and the parking lamps were repositioned beneath directly below the headlights. On {{the sides of the}} body the rub-rail moldings formed a right angle with the vertical trim on the rear doors or fenders. This accentuated the character line in the sheet metal. The Florentine curve rear window treatment was adopted for sedans. Three chrome moldings bordered the rear license plate on either side and deck lid decorations consisted of a V-shaped ornament and a Cadillac crest. The Coupe de Ville had a golden script nameplate at the upper body belt just forward of the rear <b>window</b> <b>pillar.</b> The Eldorado sport convertible featured extras such as wide chrome body belt moldings, a distinctive rear fender design, with twin round taillights halfway up the fenders and flatter pointed tailfins. Tubeless tires were a new standard Cadillac feature. Sales reached a record 118,190, accounting for nearly 84% of all Cadillacs sold. Standard equipment included back-up lights, turn signals, and automatic transmission.|$|E

50|$|When the {{business}} was sold in 1978 the fleet consisted of 55 buses, mainly AECs and Leylands operating on nine routes. McVicar's livery was a red body with cream <b>window</b> <b>pillars</b> and a brown roof with a McVicar Omnibus Service monogram on the sides. A variation of this livery was adopted by Bankstown-Strathfield Bus Service and remained in use until the operation was sold to Transit First in May 2003. Some of the number plates carried by McVicar's buses continue {{to be used by}} Transdev NSW. See McVicar's Bus Services at Australian Bus Fleet Lists.|$|R
50|$|In 1956 {{there was}} a new grille, with finer {{textured}} insert, and the repositioning of the parking lights in the bumpers, below the wing guards. Buyers were given an option of the standard satin finish grille or an optional gold finish. Cadillac script was found on the left side. A narrow chrome molding and nine vertical louvers were seen. The Coupe de Ville had a model nameplate and a Cadillac crest {{on the sides of the}} front fenders. The Coupe de Ville was joined by the Series 62 Sedan de Ville, Cadillac's first standard production 4-door hardtop. Similarly to the Coupe de Ville, it was also more expensive and more luxuriously trimmed that the standard 4-door Series 62. With 41,732 sold, it also easily outsold the Series 62 sedan in its very first year. Given their sales success, it was only natural that the Coupe de Ville and Sedan de Ville were moved to their own separate series in 1959, the Series 6300, being joined by a De Ville convertible in 1964. The Eldorado subseries also gained a new bodystyle, a 2-door hardtop called the Seville. An Eldorado script finally appeared with fender crest on the car which was further distinguished by a twin hood ornament. Extras featured on the Eldorado convertible, now known as the Biarritz in order to distinguish it from the Seville, were a ribbed chrome saddle molding extending from the windshield to the rear <b>window</b> <b>pillar</b> along the beltline and flat, pointed rear fender fins. Power steering was now standard. The turning circle was 43.5 ft. wide and ground clearance is 8.25 inches. Popular Mechanics rated a 0-60 mph time of 12.0 seconds, fuel economy for a traffic route at 8.3mpg, and a very accurate speedometer.|$|E

40|$|A brief {{analysis}} of the decorative system peculiar to Romanian sacred architecture leads to singling out an element that distinctly stands out, being present in {{the overwhelming majority of}} the respective worship places. It is the string-course, a protruding ornament that circumscribes the median part of the façade and is made of various materials: stone, brick, plaster. At first sight it appears to be an agreeable, ingenious aesthetic solution, since the horizontal line it emphasizes enters into a pleasant dialogue with the vertical arches, <b>windows,</b> <b>pillars</b> and other upright elements. The present essay points out that this element is not a mere aesthetic device, but has a deep symbolic significance related to that of the church it girdles...|$|R

2500|$|The car {{featured}} a low modern body {{line with a}} prominent waist level groove reminiscent of the then fashionable Chevrolet Corvair. [...] At a time when monocoque construction was becoming mainstream, the 24 sat on a separate and very strong tubular steel chassis: [...] it was therefore possible, even using the economically available materials of the time, to keep the <b>window</b> <b>pillars</b> relatively thin which gave the car an airy cabin and outstanding all-round visibility, while class leading structural rigidity for the body could nonetheless be claimed, thanks to the pleating and reinforcement of the roof panel. The tubular steel front and rear subchassis were bolted to a platform frame that comprised {{the floor and the}} flat steel sidemembers. Under the skin, the structural architecture was little changed from that of the Dyna 54.|$|R

A few of the main businesses that anchor the downtown are Gerdes Pharmacy and Orlando Brothers grocery store.|$|R
2500|$|Alongside the Bloomfields VAL on the Plaxton stand was {{a further}} revised Panorama. This was an {{altogether}} much larger looking vehicle than before, with deeper windows all round, the waistline curvature radically {{reduced to a}} point where it was almost straight, a new rear window interchangeable with the windscreen, and a {{reduction in the number of}} <b>window</b> <b>pillars</b> on 36-foot versions. Because of the adverse reaction to the [...] "multi-windowed" [...] Embassy, from 1963 all 36-foot Plaxton coach bodies used the new Panorama shell, with windows of large size whether fixed or opening, although, as previously, the Panorama name was restricted to underfloor-engined coaches with fixed glazing and entrance ahead of the front axle. Of the non-Panoramas, by far the most popular model was the new production body on the Bedford VAL chassis, which retained the large oval grill because of the front-mounted radiator, and was simply named Val.|$|R

[...] In the Church of England the area is in the parish of Acton (St Mary), see Acton, Cheshire.|$|R
5000|$|The three {{principal}} {{new models}} introduced by Renault {{since the war}} [...] had all featured monocoque [...] "chassisless" [...] construction which was believed to save cost in the manufacturing process and to cut running costs by reducing vehicle weight. The Renault R3/R4 design defied this by now widely accepted mantra, employing a separate platform to which the body shell was then attached. The body's structural role in maintaining the overall rigidity of the car body was thereby reduced, placing less stress {{on the roof and}} allowing for thinner <b>window</b> <b>pillars.</b> Although the use made of a separate platform resembled, in some respects, the use that pre-war designs would have made of a chassis, the outcome was a structure described as semi-monocoque, and it would later allow Renault to use the R4 platform, with very little modification, to build new models such as the Renault 6 and Rodeo. (Later, the successful Renault 5 used the R4 running gear but in a monocoque shell).|$|R
