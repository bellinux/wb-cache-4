Chris Sorrell, who previously served as director of the first game, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in development so the project was handed over to James Shepherd instead.|$|E
5|$|As {{second in}} command of the SS and then Reichsführer-SS, Himmler was in regular contact with Hitler to arrange for SS men as bodyguards; Himmler <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> with Nazi Party {{policy-making}} decisions in the years leading up to the seizure of power. From the late 1930s, the SS was independent of the control of other state agencies or government departments, and he reported only to Hitler.|$|E
5|$|At 9a.m. on July4, Berger {{left her}} {{apartment}} for the Mother Earth offices. Fifteen minutes later a deadly explosion took place. The bomb had exploded prematurely, shaking the sixth story of Berger's tenement building, wrecking the three upper floors and killing Berg, Caron, Hanson, and a woman, Marie Chavez, who apparently <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in the conspiracy. Berkman arranged the dead men's funerals.|$|E

There are no memorials or headstones dedicated to him today, and his Victoria Cross is not on public display.|$|E
5|$|For {{the film}} score, Mizoguchi relied on {{composer}} Fumio Hayasaka and the assistant directors, and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in their creative process. Fumio Hayasaka {{was a strong}} proponent of using Japanese music in Japanese films. For Ugetsu, he employed geza music, common in Kabuki theatre. Additional, uncredited composers were Ichiro Saito and Tamekichi Mochizuki, whose music was blended with Hayasaka's, and could provide accurate music reflective of the period.|$|E

5|$|After this, {{the units}} of I Anzac Corps {{returned}} to the Somme, to relieve units of the Fourth Army, which had managed to push their lines to a position just below the Bapaume heights throughout September. The 2nd Battalion <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in any major actions during this time, although elements from the 1st Brigade—specifically the 1st Battalion {{with support from the}} 3rd—put in an attack on a salient that had developed in the front line north of Gueudecourt, which failed amid exceptionally muddy conditions.|$|E
5|$|As a {{young lawyer}} Chelvanayakam <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in {{politics}} but when the ACTC was established in 1944 {{he became one of}} its principal organisers. Ponnambalam was the ACTC's president and Chelvanayakam was effectively his deputy. Chelvanayakam was part of the delegation, led by Ponnambalam, to the Soulbury Commission which argued unsuccessfully for balanced representation. Chelvanayakam stood as the ACTC candidate for Kankesanthurai in the 1947 parliamentary election. He won the election and entered Parliament.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} first instalment, Jumping Flash! 2 was {{developed}} by Japanese developer Exact Co., Ltd however Ultra Co., Ltd <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in development. The game engine {{and most of the}} interface were transferred from its predecessor to Jumping Flash! 2 in order to save time during the development. Despite the initial similarities the developers decided to give Jumping Flash! 2 a much larger draw distance, higher quality textures, and updated enemy AI in order to give the game a more memorable first-person 3D perspective. Jumping Flash! 2 was not designed to be a technology demonstrator, unlike its predecessor.|$|E

5|$|Betances was {{the fourth}} of six children; the oldest of which would die shortly after birth; Betances was the only male among the {{surviving}} siblings.

His mother died in 1837, when he was nine years old, and his father remarried in 1839; the five children he had with María del Carmen Torres Pagán included Ramón's half-brother Felipe Adolfo, who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in politics (according to Ramón) but was nevertheless arrested following the Grito de Lares years later.|$|E
5|$|For years {{leading up}} to the {{creation}} of the park, the leading citizens and newspapers in Albany had pushed for a grand public park. Frederick Law Olmsted's Olmsted, Vaux and Company was hired in 1869 to plan such a park. In their plan they envisioned Washington Park as the centerpiece of a string of parks and boulevards similar to those they had designed in Buffalo, Boston, and Brooklyn. Though Olmsted and his company <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in the actual design of the park, their broad vision was followed for the detailed designs, including the idea of damming the Beaver Kill (Beaver Creek) to form a grand lake.|$|E
5|$|Hamauzu has {{not been}} {{involved}} in the production of any other Chocobo soundtracks. Chocobo's Dungeon 2s soundtrack was composed by a group of five composers, and was the last Chocobo game soundtrack to not be mainly composed of remixes of previous Final Fantasy and Chocobo music. Hamauzu <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in the creation of either the remixes or original tracks for these albums. His role was filled by Kumi Tanioka for Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon, Kenji Ito for Chocobo Racing, and Yuzo Takahashi for Chocobo and the Magic Picture Book: The Witch, The Maiden, and the Five Heroes.|$|E

5|$|Harada {{was born}} in the village of Asajawa in Nagano Prefecture on 11 August 1916. After {{completing}} school, he joined the Imperial Japanese Navy's naval infantry force in 1933, aged 17. He later transferred to the Navy's aviation branch, and graduated first in the 35th pilot training class in February 1937. Harada was posted to China in October that year during the Second Sino-Japanese War, but <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in any aerial combat. While in China he witnessed Japanese military personnel indiscriminately killing Chinese civilians in the mistaken belief that they were soldiers in disguise. He also participated in the USS Panay incident. Harada returned to Japan in January 1938, and subsequently served in several training positions.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{gave the}} ruins to the Carey family, who {{retained}} {{it until it}} passed by marriage into first the Heviningham and then the Coke families. The castle <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in {{the events of the}} English Civil War in the 17th century, and escaped the slighting that affected many similar properties, probably because the collapse of the outer walls had already made it indefensible and of little military value. In 1737, after the death of Edward Coke, the castle and the surrounding manor were bought by Thomas Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, for £22,500.|$|E
5|$|In 1758, Washington {{participated in}} the Forbes Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne. He was embarrassed by a {{friendly}} fire episode in which his unit and another British unit each thought that {{the other was the}} French enemy and opened fire, with 14 dead and 26 wounded in the mishap. Washington <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in any other major fighting on the expedition, and the British scored a major strategic victory, gaining control of the Ohio Valley when the French abandoned the fort. Following the expedition, he retired from his Virginia Regiment commission in December 1758. He did not return to military life until the outbreak of the revolution in 1775.|$|E

5|$|In 1990 Hata {{argued that}} the {{recently}} released monologue of Emperor Hirohito, the former Emperor's recollection of wartime Japan which he recorded shortly after World War II, had likely been created {{to prove to the}} United States that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in war crimes and consequently Hata theorized that an English language translation must have also been drawn up at the same time, a theory which was mocked by right-wing scholars who felt the monologue was created as a simple historical record without ulterior motives. In 1997 the English language draft was discovered.|$|E
5|$|In April 2014, Orci and Kurtzman {{confirmed}} to Variety {{that they are}} no longer going to work together on film projects but will still collaborate on television.

Orci confirmed later that year in July that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in the production of The Amazing Spider-Man 3 alongside Kurtzman.

5|$|In August 1918, a more {{virulent strain}} {{appeared}} simultaneously in Brest, France; in Freetown, Sierra Leone; {{and in the}} U.S. in Boston, Massachusetts. The Spanish flu also spread through Ireland, carried there by returning Irish soldiers. The Allies of World War I came {{to call it the}} Spanish flu, primarily because the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918. Spain <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> in the war and had not imposed wartime censorship.|$|E
