5000|$|The {{mainstream}} {{transition to}} the use of stem-wind, stem-set watches occurred at around {{the same time as the}} end of the manufacture and use of the fusee watch. Fusee chain-driven timing was replaced with a mainspring of better quality spring steel (commonly known as the [...] "going barrel") allowing for a more even release of power to the escape mechanism. However the reader of this article should not be misled to think that the <b>winding</b> <b>and</b> <b>setting</b> functions are directly related to the balance wheel and balance spring. The balance wheel and balance spring provide a separate function: to regulate the timing (or escape) of the movement.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{operating}} strategy is suggested for {{the participation of}} variable speed, variable pitch wind generators (VSVPWG) in primary load-frequency regulation through pitch-control. The proposed strategy is mathematically precise <b>and</b> neither direct <b>wind</b> measurement as a control input, nor any linearization of the system are required. The above suggested are independent of the specific type of the electric generator connected to the turbine and the only requirement is {{the expansion of the}} look-up tables of the aerodynamic characteristics of the rotor. The operating strategy is applied to a VSVPWG model developed in MATLAB Simulink and connected to both a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) and a full-power converter synchronous generator (FPCSG). Indicative simulation results are shown, the effectiveness of the proposed control versus <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>set</b> point of power variations is validated, tuning issues are addressed and lastly a comparison is presented between the aforementioned technique and the method of over-speeding previously developed and published in the specific field of research. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R

50|$|One day a great storm {{destroyed}} the plantation of Lekapai in Sāmoa. Lekapai swore revenge on {{the god of}} the <b>winds</b> <b>and</b> <b>set</b> out in his canoe. He arrived at an island, but there was no opening in the reef. The boat was turned over, but Lekapai made it alive to the shore. He went inland and came at a house where a beautiful girl was standing. She {{turned out to be the}} daughter of the wind god, who was sleeping at that momernt. When the god slept it was calm, when he awoke there were storms. The girl told Lekapai to tiptoe to her sleeping father, to take a lock of his hear and to tie it to a big tree, then another lock to another tree, and so on. Next the god was woken up and found himself powerless. Soon he and Lekapai came to an agreement. He would live here and marry the damsel, and the god himself would retire to some other premises in the bush. So Lekapai and the girl lived together for a long long time.|$|R
5000|$|Antonina is {{an unusually}} {{sympathetic}} recounting of the adventurous but adulterous life of Belisarius' wife. It {{is based on}} the biography of Belisarius by Procopius of Caesaria. According to Procopius, “Belisarius let his wife have her own way in everything” and she “hoodwinked him by enchantments.” [...] This liberated one-time prostitute had risen from the streets of Constantinople to be the confidante of the Empress Theodora. She even raised and led an army in Italy where she with her husband had been besieged for over a year. [...] "Antonina together with the commanders began at daybreak to consider means of transporting the cargoes. ... They therefore selected the small boats belonging to the larger ships, put a fence of high planks around them on all sides, in order that the men on board might not be exposed to the enemy's shots, and embarked archers and sailors on them in numbers suitable for each boat. After they had loaded the boats with all the freight they could carry, they waited for a favoring <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>set</b> sail toward Rome by the Tiber.” ...|$|R

5000|$|Shortly after {{construction}} {{it became}} clear that the tower-mounted instruments were too easily moved by <b>wind,</b> <b>and</b> Brahe <b>set</b> about constructing a more suitable observation site.

The basic layout was similar to Uraniborg, with a wall of similar shape surrounding the site, although the enclosed area was much smaller. The instruments were all placed underground, covered by opening shutters or a rotating dome in buildings built over the instrument pits.|$|R

40|$|Towards the end {{of their}} {{evolution}} hot massive stars develop strong stellar <b>winds</b> <b>and</b> appear as emission line stars, such as WR stars or LBVs. The quantitative description of the mass loss in these important pre-SN phases is hampered by unknowns such as clumping and porosity due to an in-homogeneous <b>wind</b> structure, <b>and</b> by an incomplete theoretical understanding of optically thick stellar winds. In this work we investigate the conditions in deep atmospheric layers of WR stars to find out whether these comply with the theory of optically thick <b>winds,</b> <b>and</b> whether we find indications of clumping in these layers. We use a new semi-empirical method to determine sonic-point optical depths, densities, and temperatures for a large sample of WR stars of the carbon (WC) and oxygen (WO) sequence. Based on an artificial model sequence we investigate the reliability of our method and its sensitivity to uncertainties in stellar parameters. We find that the WR stars in our sample obey an approximate relation with P_rad/P_gas~ 80 at the sonic point. This 'wind condition' is ubiquitous for radiatively driven, optically thick <b>winds,</b> <b>and</b> <b>sets</b> constraints on possible wind/envelope solutions affecting radii, mass-loss rates, and clumping properties. Our results suggest that the presence of an optically thick wind may force many stars near the Eddington limit to develop clumped, radially extended sub-surface zones. The clumping in these zones is most likely sustained by the non-linear strange-mode instability, and may be the origin of the observed wind clumping. The properties of typical late-type WC stars comply with this model. Solutions without sub-surface clumping and inflation are also possible but demand for compact stars with comparatively low mass-loss rates. These objects may resemble the small group of WO stars with their exceptionally hot stellar temperatures <b>and</b> highly ionized <b>winds.</b> Comment: accepted by A&...|$|R
50|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism {{above and}} {{beyond the call of duty}} as commander of a Catalina patrol plane in rescuing personnel of the U.S. Army 5th Air Force shot down in combat over Kavieng Harbor in the Bismarck Sea, February 15, 1944. On air alert in the vicinity of Vitu Islands, Lt. (then Lt. j.g.) Gordon unhesitatingly responded to a report of the crash and flew boldly into the harbor, defying close-range fire from enemy shore guns to make 3 separate landings in full view of the Japanese and pick up 9 men, several of them injured. With his cumbersome flying boat dangerously overloaded, he made a brilliant takeoff despite heavy swells and almost total absence of <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>set</b> a course for base, only to receive the report of another group stranded in a rubber life raft 600 yards from the enemy shore. Promptly turning back, he again risked his life to set his plane down under direct fire of the heaviest defenses of Kavieng and take aboard 6 more survivors, coolly making his fourth dexterous takeoff with 15 rescued officers and men. By his exceptional daring, personal valor, and incomparable airmanship under most perilous conditions, Lieutenant Gordon prevented certain death or capture of our airmen by the Japanese.|$|R
