5000|$|A third {{draft was}} {{presented}} on 3 July 2017. A last obstacle for agreement was {{the condition of}} the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>clause,</b> meaning that a state party “in exercising its national sovereignty, ... decides that extraordinary events related to {{the subject matter of the}} Treaty have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country.” The majority perspective was that this condition is subjective, and no security interests can justify genocide, nor can mass destruction contribute to security. However, as also a neutral <b>withdrawal</b> <b>clause</b> not giving reasons was not accepted by the minority, the respective Article 17 was accepted as a compromise. Safeguards against arbitrary use are the withdrawal period of twelve months and the prohibition of withdrawal during an armed conflict.|$|E

40|$|This Essay, a {{contribution}} to a symposium on Withdrawing from Customary International Law published in the Duke Journal of Comparative and International Law, analyzes the rules governing unilateral exit from multilateral treaties and considers the insights they offer for understanding how unilateral withdrawals from customary international law (CIL) might function in practice. Drawing upon my previous study of the design and use of treaty denunciation and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>clauses,</b> I argue that if the rules governing unilateral exit from CIL were to track those governing unilateral exit from treaties, states {{would be subject to}} a wide array of procedural and substantive constraints on their ability to exit from international laws they no longer intend to follow. Part I reviews the procedural limitations on treaty denunciations, including the obligation to act in good faith, the requirement to provide reasonable notice of an intent to withdraw, and the possibility of offering a justification for the state’s decision to quit a treaty. Part II analyzes the substantive constraints on treaty denunciations, including the presumption against partial exit and against withdrawals from treaties that contain no provisions governing denunciation or withdrawal. Part III analyzes the legal consequences of exit, including the withdrawing state’s continuing responsibility for violations that occurred before a denunciation or withdrawal takes effect...|$|R
40|$|Scholars {{have long}} {{understood}} that the instability of power has ramifications for compliance with international law. Scholars have not, however, focused on how states’ expectations about shifting power affect the initial design of international agreements. In this paper, I integrate shifting power into {{an analysis of the}} initial design of both the formal and substantive aspects of agreements. I argue that a state expecting to become more powerful over time incurs an opportunity cost by agreeing to formal provisions that raise the cost of exiting an agreement. Exit costs - which promote the stability of legal rules - have distributional implications. Before joining an agreement, an “ascendant” state will therefore often require either a greater share of the benefits from cooperation, or a reduction in exit costs through the use of formal provisions such as <b>withdrawal</b> <b>clauses,</b> sunset clauses, and provisions affecting the legality of an agreement. I analyze how states determine which concessions to make in order to reach agreement with an ascendant state. This analysis helps explain a number of puzzles in the international legal literature, such as why states with poor compliance rates are sometimes observed to join international agreements at the same or higher rates than states with good compliance rates; why weak agreements often evolve into more constraining agreements; and why multilateral agreements are more likely have low exit costs than bilateral agreements...|$|R

She argues [...] "The provision on the establishment of “secure and recognized boundaries” would have been meaningless if there had been an obligation to withdraw from all the territories.U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger recalled the first time he heard someone invoke [...] "the sacramental language of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, mumbling about the need for a just and lasting peace within secure and recognized borders". He said the phrase was so platitudinous that he thought the speaker was pulling his leg. Kissinger said that, at that time, he did not appreciate how the flood of words used to justify the various demands obscured rather than illuminated the fundamental positions. Kissinger said those [...] "clashing perspectives" [...] prevented any real bargaining and explained: Jordan’s acquiescence in Resolution 242 had been obtained in 1967 by the promise of our United Nations Ambassador Arthur Goldberg that under its terms we would work for the return of the West Bank of Jordan with minor boundary rectifications and that we were prepared to use our influence to obtain a role for Jordan in Jerusalem.|$|E
40|$|Debates {{about the}} future of UK-EU {{relations}} have paid little attention to the European Parliament. There have been no studies comparable to those that have looked into how member states view the renegotiation or might respond to a Brexit. Media reports indicate that the European Commission taskforce handling the UK renegotiation has even looked into ways of avoiding the Parliament becoming involved. Questions persist, however, as to whether the Parliament can be ignored. If Britain votes to leave then the EU Treaty’s <b>withdrawal</b> <b>clause</b> guarantees the Parliament a say in the final deal. To find out the views of the European Parliament BrexitVote is running a series – compiled by Tim Oliver – in which MEPs from across the Parliament set out what they think of the UK-EU renegotiation, the idea of Brexit and – most importantly – what role they think the Parliament will play. In this, {{the second part of the}} series, we hear from MEPs in the European People’s Party (EPP) ...|$|E

In the first chapter called Right of withdrawal, in four sections present some introductory considerations allow us to approach {{the study of the}} figure. To do this, in the first section, exposes what is called initial considerations of the study, which discusses some relevant issues around consumer protection. In the second section discusses the concept of the right to desist in their different meanings. In the third, it is an exercise approach and conceptual comparison. In the fourth, the justification cited social, economic and legal right to exist as the analyte and finally in the fourth, its legal nature. In the second chapter called Right of withdrawal regulation, in two different sections, one devoted to European law and other Spanish law, exposes the legal regulation of the figure. To do this, make a normative historical study which sets out {{each and every one of}} the directives and laws that have governed the institution. The third chapter called Right of withdrawal elements, consists of three sections, the first devoted to the analysis of the subjective elements of the legal, namely consumer and entrepreneur. The second is devoted to the analysis of the target element. And third, devoted to the study of the content of the right. The fourth chapter, entitled Effects of Right of withdrawal, as the name suggests is the study of the consequences of exercising the right of withdrawal involves dedicating a section specific to each. The fifth chapter called withdrawal contract law, is the study of the figure in the form of contract. This emphasizes what it is, a species of the genus and as such, should be based on their normative postulates. We also analyze the mechanisms provided by the legislature for the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>clause</b> is incorporated into the agreement, namely through the contract offer, promotions or special sales, advertising and finally, the consensuality, in where also studied abuse that the consumer may be through calls general contractual clauses and unfair term...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} book to jointly scrutinise two existential issues for the EU: {{withdrawal}} of a member state (i. e. Brexit) and territorial secession (affecting Scotland, Catalonia and beyond). The book applies normative and empirical analyses, explores new approaches and discusses the deep theoretical problems unleashed by these processes. Featuring a superb constellation of legal and political science scholars, the book combines specific legal analysis and considers the political dynamics behind the processes. It provides extensive coverage and sophisticated analysis of the interpretation of Article 50 and the possible consequences it may have. The implications of withdrawal and secession on EU citizenship are discussed in depth {{and there is an}} overview of the evolving nature {{of the relationship between the}} regions and the EU. Finally, there is an engaging normative discussion on the deeper meaning of these two processes with respect to the objective of European integration.
