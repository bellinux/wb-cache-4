40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In gymnastics, {{the wrist}} {{is exposed to}} many {{different}} stresses including increased extension, especially during back handsprings. Currently a wrist extension angle during impact that places the wrist in danger has not been established. The {{purpose of this study}} was to: (1) determine the mean impact <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> during a standing back handspring in female preadolescent and adolescent gymnasts and (2) determine which factors predict impact wrist angles. METHODS: Fifty female gymnasts from six facilities, ages 8 - 15 were included in this study. Each gymnast completed a questionnaire about gymnastics participation and history of wrist pain. Active range of motion of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, and ankle was measured. Each gymnast was asked to perform a standard back handspring, which was videotaped. The wrist and shoulder flexion angles, at maximum impact, were recorded and measured using motion analysis software. Two-sample t-test was used to assess the relationship between impact <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> and wrist pain. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the association between related variables and impact <b>wrist</b> <b>angle.</b> RESULTS: The mean back handspring impact <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> was 95 °. Fifteen subjects (30 %) reported wrist pain. Years of participation (p= 0. 02) and impact shoulder angle (p= 0. 04) were predictive of impact wrist angles. CONCLUSION: Shoulder angles and years of participation correlate with impact wrist angles during the performance of a standing back handspring. Future studies are necessary to determine if addressing these factors can affect the impact wrist angles. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of <b>wrist</b> <b>angle,</b> sex, and handedness on {{the changes in the}} median nerve cross-sectional area (MNCSA) and median nerve diameters, namely longitudinal diameter (D 1) and vertical diameter (D 2). Ultrasound examination was conducted to examine the median nerve at the proximal carpal tunnel in both dominant and nondominant hands of men (n = 27) and women (n = 26). A total of seven wrist angles were examined: neutral; 15 °, 30 °, and 45 ° extension; and 15 °, 30 °, and 45 ° flexion. Our results indicated sexual dimorphism and bilateral asymmetry of MNCSA, D 1 and D 2 measurements. MNCSA was significantly reduced when the <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> changed from neutral to flexion or extension positions. At flexion positions, D 1 was significantly smaller than that at neutral. In contrast, at extension positions, D 2 was significantly smaller than that at neutral. In conclusion, this study showed that MNCSA decreased as the <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> changed from neutral to flexion or extension positions in both dominant and nondominant hands of both sexes, whereas deformation of the median nerve differed between wrist flexion and extension...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{electromyography}} (SEMG) {{is widely}} used for the functional assessment of skeletal muscles, while sonography has been commonly used to detect its morphological information. We defined the signal about the continuous change of the morphological parameters of muscles detected by ultrasound as sonomyography (SMG). In this study, we continuously sampled the ultrasound image, SEMG signals on the extensor carpi radialis muscle together with the <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> simultaneously during {{the whole process of}} wrist extension and flexion from 7 normal subjects. A three-layer feed-forward artificial neural network with BP learning algorithm was used to predict the <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> with the muscle deformation SMG and root mean square of SEMG signals as inputs. The overall mean R value was 0. 96 plusmn 0. 02, the mean standard root mean square error was 7. 26 plusmn 1. 98, and the mean relative root mean square errors was 0. 160 plusmn 0. 037.

40|$|Objective. To {{describe}} the wrist kinematics during movement through free {{range of motion}} and {{activities of daily living}} using a cyclical task. Design. The <b>wrist</b> <b>angles</b> were initially calculated in a calibration trial and then in two selected activities of daily living (jar opening and carton pouring). Background. Existing studies which {{describe the}} wrist movement do not address the specific application of daily activities. Moreover, the data presented from subject to subject may differ simply because of the non-cyclical nature of the upper limbs movements. Methods. The coordinates of external markers attached to bone references on the forearm and dorsal side of the hand were obtained using an optical motion capture system. The <b>wrist</b> <b>angles</b> were derived from free motion trials and successively calculated in four healthy subjects for two specific cyclical daily activities (opening a jar and pouring from a carton). Results. The free motions trial highlighted the interaction between the <b>wrist</b> <b>angles.</b> Both the jar opening and the carton pouring activity showed a repetitive pattern for the three angles within the cycle length. In the jar-opening task, the standard deviation for the whole population was 10. 8 degrees for flexion-extension, 5. 3 degrees for radial-ulnar deviation and 10. 4 degrees for pronation-supination. In the carton-pouring task, the standard deviation for the whole population was 16. 0 degrees for flexion-extension, 3. 4 degrees for radial-ulnar deviation and 10. 7 degrees for pro nation-supination. Conclusion. Wrist kinematics in healthy subjects can be successfully described by the rotations about the axes of marker-defined coordinates systems during free range of motion and daily activities using cyclical tasks...|$|R
40|$|Our {{understanding}} of proprioceptive deficits in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) {{and its potential}} contribution to impaired motor function is still limited. To gain more insight into these issues, we evaluated accuracy and precision of joint position sense over a range of flexion-extension <b>angles</b> of the <b>wrist</b> of the affected and unaffected sides in 25 chronic CRPS patients and in 50 healthy controls. The results revealed proprioceptive impairment at both the patients' affected and unaffected sides, characterized predominantly by overestimation of <b>wrist</b> extension <b>angles.</b> Precision of the position estimates was more prominently reduced at the affected side. Importantly, group differences in proprioceptive performance were observed not only for tests at identical percentages of each individual's range of wrist motion but also when controls were tested at <b>wrist</b> <b>angles</b> that corresponded {{to those of the}} patient's affected side. More severe motor impairment of the affected side was associated with poorer proprioceptive performance. Based on additional sensory tests, variations in proprioceptive performance over the range of <b>wrist</b> <b>angles,</b> and comparisons between active and passive displacements, the disturbances of proprioceptive performance most likely resulted from altered processing of afferent (and not efferent) information and its subsequent interpretation {{in the context of a}} distorted "body schema. " Perspective The present results point at a significant role for impaired central processing of proprioceptive information in the motor dysfunction of CRPS and suggest that therapeutic strategies aimed at identification of proprioceptive impairments and their restoration may promote the recovery of motor function in CRPS patients. © 2013 by the American Pain Society...|$|R

40|$|Maximal {{electromyogram}} (EMG) {{levels of}} the first dorsal interosseus muscle (FDI) were studied during maximal pinching between index finger and thumb at two different wrist angles. Despite {{the fact that there}} was no change in the biomechanical conditions for the FDI, the maximal EMG {{levels of the}} FDI differed significantly; typically EMG levels were higher while pinching at a maximally flexed <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> compared to a maximally extended <b>wrist</b> <b>angle.</b> The stability of the EMG recordings was checked with supramaximal peripheral nerve stimulation. Significant changes in the area of the compound muscle actions potentials (M-waves) were obtained. However, these changes could not explain the observed differences in the maximal EMG levels.

40|$|Sonomyography (SMG) is {{the signal}} we {{previously}} termed to describe muscle contraction using real-time muscle thickness changes extracted from ultrasound images. In this paper, we used least squares {{support vector machine}} (LS-SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict dynamic wrist angles from SMG signals. Synchronized <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> and SMG signals from the extensor carpi radialis muscles of five normal subjects were recorded {{during the process of}} wrist extension and flexion at rates of 15, 22. 5, and 30 cycles/min, respectively. An LS-SVM model together with back-propagation (BP) and radial basis function (RBF) ANN was developed and trained using the data sets collected at the rate of 22. 5 cycles/min for each subject. The established LS-SVM and ANN models were then used to predict the wrist angles for the remained data sets obtained at different extension rates. It was found that the <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> signals collected at different rates could be accurately predicted by all the three methods, based on the values of root mean square difference (RMSD 0. 98), with the performance of the LS-SVM model being significantly better (RMSD 0. 99) than those of its counterparts. The results also demonstrated that the models established for the rate of 22. 5 cycles/min could be used for the prediction from SMG data sets obtained under other extension rates. It was concluded that the <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> could be precisely estimated from the thickness changes of the extensor carpi radialis using LS-SVM or ANN models.

40|$|Background: The {{inherent}} {{properties of}} surface electromyography limit {{its potential for}} multi-degrees of freedom control. Our previous studies demonstrated that <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> could be predicted by muscle thickness measured from B-mode ultrasound, and hence, {{it could be an}} alternative signal for prosthetic control. However, an ultrasound imaging machine is too bulky and expensive. Objective: We aim to utilize a portable A-mode ultrasound system to examine the feasibility of using one-dimensional sonomyography (i. e. muscle thickness signals detected by A-mode ultrasound) to predict <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> with three different machine learning models - (1) support vector machine (SVM), (2) radial basis function artificial neural network (RBF ANN), and (3) back-propagation artificial neural network (BP ANN). Study Design: Feasibility study using nine healthy subjects. Methods: Each subject performed wrist extension guided at 15, 22. 5, and 30 cycles/minute, respectively. Data obtained from 22. 5 cycles/minute trials was used to train the models and the remaining trials were used for cross-validation. Prediction accuracy was quantified by relative root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficients (CC). Results: Excellent prediction was noted using SVM (RMSE = 13 %, CC = 0. 975), which outperformed the other methods. Conclusion: It appears that one-dimensional sonomyography could be an alternative signal for prosthetic control. Department of Health Technology and Informatic...|$|E

40|$|Prevalence {{rates of}} carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) in the wheelchair user population are high.

Combined with the repetitive character of the movement, this could, in time, be detrimental to the soft tissue of the wrist. To study peak <b>wrist</b> joint <b>angles</b> and their relationship with wrist- and finger-flexor activity, a three-dimensional (3 -D) analysis of wrist movement during the push phase was performed.

40|$|International audienceAlthough {{preparation}} of voluntary {{movement has been}} extensively studied, very few human neuroimaging studies have examined {{preparation of}} an intentional reaction to a motor perturbation. This latter type of preparation is fundamental for adaptive motor capabilities in everyday life because it allows a desired motor output to be maintained despite changes in external forces. Using fMRI, we studied how the sensorimotor cortical network is implicated in preparing to react to a mechanical motor perturbation. While maintaining a given <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> against a small force, subjects were instructed to prepare a reaction to a subsequent <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> displacement. This reaction consisted of, either resisting the imposed movement, or remaining passive. During the preparation of both reactions we found an early implication of M 1 and S 1 but no implication {{at all of the}} higher order motor area pre-SMA. This is clearly different from what has been found for voluntary movement preparation. These results show that the sensorimotor network activation during preparation of voluntary motor acts depends on whether one expects a motor perturbation to occur: when external forces can interfere with ongoing motor acts, the primary sensorimotor areas must be ready to react as quickly as possible to perturbations that could prevent the goal of the ongoing motor act from being achieved.

40|$|A {{structural}} model of skeletal muscle {{based on the}} bone-muscle lever system is proposed to describe the relationship between <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> and thickness of the extensor carpi radialis muscle {{during the process of}} wrist flexion-extension. This model applied the cosine theorem to the expression for muscle length, in order to relate <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> to muscle thickness by the invariance of muscle volume, which was used to calculate the length of the extensor carpi radialis muscle from the muscle thickness. To validate the proposed model, wrist angles were also computed by other models based on regression, such as linear regressions, an artificial neural network, and a support vector machine. The results show that wrist angles are predicted well at different extension rates by our proposed model, with correlation coefficient (R 2) greater than 0. 94, standard root mean square error (SRMSE) less than 8. 0 and relative root mean square error (RRMSE) less than 13 %. These parameters show that the proposed model is better than the other regression-based models (p < 0. 05). More importantly, this model can be clearly related to physiology. Thus, it can potentially be used to investigate the relationship between internal structural changes of skeletal muscle and external limb behaviors, and to develop prosthetic hands and functional electrical stimulation systems.

40|$|Electromyography (EMG) {{has been}} widely used for the {{assessment}} of musculoskeletal functions and the control of electrical prostheses, which make use of the EMG signal generated by the contraction of the residual muscles. In spite of the successful applications of EMG in different fields, it has some inherent limitations, such as the difficulty to differentiate the actions of neighboring muscles and to collect signals from deep muscles using the surface EMG. The majority of current EMG controlled prostheses can only provide sequential on–off controls using signals from two groups of muscles, so the users are required to put many conscious efforts in monitoring the speed and range of motion of the terminal devices being controlled. Recently, many alternative signals based on the detection of dimensional changes of muscles or tendons during actions have been reported. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the potential of the dimensional change of muscles detected using sonography for musculoskeletal assessment and control. A portable B-mode ultrasound scanner was used to collect the dynamic ultrasound images of the forearm muscles of six normally limbed young adults and three amputee subjects. A motion analysis system was used to collect the movement of the <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> during the experiments for the normal subjects. It was demonstrated that the morphological changes of forearm muscles during actions can be successfully detected by ultrasound and linearly correlated (R² = 0. 876 ± 0. 042, mean ± S. D.) with the <b>wrist</b> <b>angle.</b> We named these sonographically detected signals about the architectural change of the muscle as sonomyography (SMG). The mean ratio between the <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> and the percentage deformation of the forearm muscle was 7. 2 ± 3. 7 °/% for the normal subjects. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of this ratio among the three repeated tests was 0. 868. The SMG signals from the residual forearms were also successfully detected when the three amputee subjects contracted their residual muscles. The results demonstrated that SMG had potentials for the musculoskeletal control and assessment. Department of Health Technology and InformaticsAuthor name used in this publication: Y. P.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{effect of a}} muscle following agonist-to-antagonist tendon transfers does not always meet the surgeon's expectations. We tested the hypothesis that after flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) to extensor carpi radialis (ECR) tendon transfer in the rat, the direction (flexion or extension) of the muscle's joint moment is dependent on joint angle. Five weeks after recovery from surgery (tendon transfer group) and in a control group, wrist angle-moment characteristics of selectively activated FCU muscle were assessed for progressive stages of dissection: 1) with minimally disrupted connective tissues, 2) after distal tenotomy, and 3) after maximal tendon and muscle belly dissection, but leaving blood supply and innervations intact. In addition, force transmission from active FCU onto the distal tendon of passive palmaris longus (PL) muscle (a wrist flexor) was assessed. Excitation of control FCU yielded flexion moments at all <b>wrist</b> <b>angles</b> tested. Tenotomy decreased peak FCU moment substantially (by 93 %) but not fully. Only after maximal dissection, FCU wrist moment became negligible. The {{mechanical effect}} of transferred FCU was bidirectional: extension moments in flexed wrist positions and flexion moments in extended wrist positions. Tenotomy decreased peak extension moment (by 33 %) and increased peak flexion moment of transferred FCU (by 41 %). Following subsequent maximal FCU dissection, FCU moments decreased to near zero at all <b>wrist</b> <b>angles</b> tested. We confirmed that, after transfer of FCU towards a wrist extensor insertion, force can be transmitted from active FCU to the distal tendon of passive PL. We conclude that mechanical effects of a muscle after tendon transfer to an antagonistic site can be quite different from those predicted {{based solely on the}} sign of the new moment arm at the joint.

Experiments were conducted to collect dominant hand grip pressure and joint-angle data during activities of daily life. Representative actions chosen as part of this study were: pushing a weighted cylinder along a flat surface, pulling a weighted cylinder across a flat surface, and lifting a weighted cylinder from a flat surface to shoulder height. Three separate weighted cylinders were used, 3 lbs., 5 lbs., and 10 lbs., and the representative motions were repeated five times for each cylinder. A Tekscan Grip VersaTek Pressure Measurement System and Motion Analysis Cortex System were utilized to collect data. Each subject was outfitted with 18 separate sensorized piezo-resistive tiles placed on their dominant hand and 33 reflective markers at representative locations on their body. The motion of each cylinder was tracked via the placement of seven retro-reflective markers on the cylinder's surface. Analysis of cohort data from five male and five female volunteers, aged between 23 and 51 years, is presented. A Moving Average Filter was implemented to automatically determine contact between the subject's hand and the weighted cylinder.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: It is popularly {{believed}} that maintaining more {{weight on the}} front foot and reducing wrist action on the downswing are characteristics of a successful golf chip shot. Therefore, experienced golfers should utilize these strategies more than inexperienced golfers when performing this shot. PURPOSE: To analyze the effect of skill level on weight shift and wrist action in a golf chip shot. METHODS: Fourteen golfers (23. 4 ± 5. 81 yr, 1. 77 ±. 073 m, 72. 1 ± 10. 4 kg), seven inexperienced (little to no training in chipping) and seven experienced (at least 8 years of training), completed three chip shots each. Trials were performed on a force plate sampled at 200 Hz and filmed using a video camera operating at 60 Hz. Retroreflective tape was placed in eight locations and digitized in order to define <b>wrist</b> <b>angle,</b> stance width, and force plate location. Kinematic and kinetic measures were compared between groups and across three times (address, end of backswing, and ball contact) using 2 x 3 (group x time) mixed model ANOVA’s. Independent t-tests were used to compare groups at specific instants in time when a significant interaction was found. RESULTS: A significant group x time interaction was found for <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> (F(1, 12) = 10. 46, p = 0. 001) but not COP measures (F(1, 12) = 0. 24, p = 0. 79). No difference in <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> between experienced and inexperience golfers was observed at address (145 °± 12. 0 °; 155 °± 9. 11 °, respectively; t 12 = 1. 754, p= 0. 105) but experienced golfers’ wrists were more cocked than inexperienced golfers {{at the end of}} the backswing (94. 9 °± 11. 6 °; 128 °± 18. 1 °; t 12 = 4. 025, p= 0. 002). This difference persisted through ball contact (135 °± 7. 30 °; 146 °± 10. 0 °; t 12 = 2. 418, p= 0. 032). Center of pressure position, expressed relative to stance width, was not significantly different between groups at any time during the swing (F(1, 12) = 0. 41, p= 0. 54). Experienced golfers did not shift their weight, defined as the difference in center of pressure position between the end of the backswing and end of follow-through, more than inexperienced golfers (0. 189 ± 0. 046 m; 0. 247 ± 0. 114 m; t 12 = 1. 26, p= 0. 231). CONCLUSION: Experienced golfers cocked their wrist more on the backswing and maintained that wrist cock through impact, similar to what is often used as instructions by PGA teaching professionals. Experienced golfers also maintained more weight on their front foot and therefore shifted less weight forward on the downswing. This lack of movement in the center of pressure may have increased his/her stability during the shot, which has been shown to increase accuracy...|$|E

In the neutral wrist position (0 °), significant reductions in the MNCSA, D 1, and D 2 were observed when finger relaxation changed to unclenched fist and clenched fist conditions. Clenched fist condition caused the highest deformations in the median nerve measurements (MNCSA, approximately − 25 %; D 1, − 13 %; D 2, − 12 %). The MNCSA was significantly lower at 30 °wrist flexion and 30 °wrist extension than in the neutral wrist position (0 °) at unclenched fist and clenched fist conditions. Notably, clenched fist condition at 30 °wrist flexion showed the highest reduction of the MNCSA (− 29 %). In addition, 30 °wrist flexion resulted in a lower D 1 at clenched fist condition. In contrast, 30 °wrist extension resulted in a lower D 2 at both unclenched fist and clenched fist conditions. Our results suggest that unclenched fist and clenched fist conditions cause reductions in the MNCSA, D 1, and D 2. More importantly, unclenched fist and clenched fist conditions at 30 °wrist flexion and 30 °wrist extension can lead to further deformation of the median nerve...|$|E
40|$|The wrist posture {{associated}} with the use of the conventional "QWERTY" keyboard is a risk factor for work-related musculoskeletal disorders in the upper limbs. Newly designed keyboards have been produced with the aim to reduce the strain in the wrist and forearm region. The present study compared the effects of using a standard keyboard and a split/angled keyboard on the forearm muscle activities and <b>wrist</b> joint <b>angles.</b> Ten subjects (6 males and 4 females) performed a standard keyboard task for 30 min, using each of the two keyboards while <b>wrist</b> joint <b>angles</b> and electromyography (EMG) were recorded. Wrist extension and ulnar deviation angles were both significantly reduced with the split/angled keyboard (p =. 030 and. 010), and lower EMG activities were recorded in the extensor carpi radialis and ulnaris muscles. The present results implied that the split/angled keyboard may be a better instrument for prolonged keyboard operation, resulting in reduced strain in the wrist and forearm region.

40|$|Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) {{is the most}} widely known entrapment neuropathy. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the incidence of CTS in a group of computer workers by typical symptoms, median nerve conduction studies, and their combinations. The posture of extended wrists while typing on a computer keyboard seems to be a predisposing factor for CTS. However, the correlation between <b>wrist</b> extension <b>angle</b> and the incidence of CTS is not well known. Forty-five subjects (mean age, 38. 8 ± 7. 8 years) who used a computer for more than 6 hours daily in a medical center in southern Taiwan were studied. All completed questionnaires to ascertain their age, employment duration, dominant hand, and the severity of symptoms. Physical examinations (Tinel's sign and Phalen's test) were performed by a physician. The maximal <b>wrist</b> extension <b>angle</b> when typing on a computer keyboard was also measured by the same physician. Nerve conduction studies were performed on each subject to determine the severity of CTS. Results showed that the incidence of CTS in the computer workers was 16. 7 % (15 of 90 hands). Twelve subjects showed electrodiagnostic evidence of CTS: it involved the dominant hand in seven, the non-dominant hand in two, and bilateral hands in three. The severity of clinical symptoms was compatible with the findings of the nerve conduction studies. Among the major predisposing factors, we found significant correlation between CTS development and the <b>wrist</b> extension <b>angle</b> while typing on a computer keyboard. Computer workers who kept their wrists extended by more than 20 ° were at greater risk of developing CTS...|$|R
40|$|Prevalence {{rates of}} carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) in the wheelchair user population are high. One of the possible causes of CTS in this population is the movement pattern of the wrist during handrim wheelchair propulsion, which could include large <b>wrist</b> joint <b>angles</b> and wrist/finger flexor activity. Combined with the repetitive character of the movement, this could, in time, be detrimental to the soft tissue of the wrist. To study peak <b>wrist</b> joint <b>angles</b> and their relationship with wrist- and finger-flexor activity, a three-dimensional (3 -D) analysis of wrist movement during the push phase was performed. Nine subjects (five nonimpaired controls, four wheelchair users) propelled a handrim wheelchair on a treadmill at three different velocities (0. 83, 1. 11, and 1. 39 m/s) and three slopes (1, 2, and 3 %), while the surface EMGs of the wrist- and finger-flexor group were recorded. Average peak <b>wrist</b> joint <b>angles</b> during the push phase were: ulnar deviation, - 24 +/- 11 degrees; radial deviation, 13 +/- 12 degrees; flexion, - 14 +/- 18 degrees; and extension, 34 +/- 16 degrees. The values for ulnar and radial deviation were close to normal values for maximal range of motion (ROM) found in the literature. Peak extension was approximately 50 % of ROM. The peak angles, which occurred with concurrent activity of the wrist flexors, were: ulnar deviation, - 22 +/- 11 degrees; radial deviation, 13 +/- 10 degrees; flexion, - 16 +/- 15 degrees; and extension, 32 +/- 16 degrees. The large deviation and extension angles, especially those recorded simultaneously with wrist flexor activity, are serious risk factors for CTS. This finding may help explain the high rates of CTS in the wheelchair user population...|$|R
40|$|Study Design Repeated-measures, crossover, double-blinded {{randomized}} controlled trial. Objectives To compare the immediate effectiveness of 2 types of counterforce braces in improving pain-free grip strength, pressure pain threshold, and <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> during a gripping task in individuals with lateral epicondylalgia. Background Sports medicine management of lateral epicondylalgia often includes {{application of a}} counterforce brace, but the comparative effectiveness of different braces is unclear. The most common brace design consists of a single strap wrapped around the proximal forearm. A variation of this brace {{is the use of}} an additional strap that wraps above the elbow, which aims to provide further unloading to the injured tissue. Methods Pain-free grip strength, pressure pain threshold, and <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> during a gripping task were measured on 34 participants with a clinical diagnosis of lateral epicondylalgia (mean ᠓D age, 47. 8 ᠸ. 5 years). Measurements were made without a brace, as well as immediately before and after the application of 2 types of counterforce braces. Each condition was tested during a separate session, with a minimum of 48 hours between sessions. Analysis-of-variance models were used to test the differences within and between conditions. Results Pain-free grip strength (17. 2 N; 95 % confidence interval: 7. 5, 26. 8) and pressure pain threshold (42. 2 kPa; 95 % confidence interval: 16. 5, 68. 0) significantly improved on the affected side immediately following the intervention conditions as well as the control condition. There {{was no significant difference between}} braces or the control condition for any outcome. Conclusion Both types of counterforce braces had an immediate positive effect in participants with lateral epicondylalgia, without differences between interventions and similar to a no-brace control condition. Therefore, while the use of a brace may be helpful in managing immediate symptoms related to lateral epicondylalgia, the choice of which brace to use may be more a function of patient preference, comfort, and cost. Further research is required to investigate the comparative longer-term and clinical effects of the 2 braces. Griffith Health, School of Rehabilitation SciencesFull Tex...|$|E
40|$|In Virtual Reality (VR), {{the body}} is often used as input in VR, having a healthy working posture is {{important}} for long session in VR. To assess how severe different interaction methods are for the body, user tests was done in VR. 14 people participated and tested six manipulation controls which operate in different ways. Their hands' and neck's position and orientation was measured throughout the test, and from this data characteristic body postures for each control setup was chosen. These were evaluated with RULA. How great the <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> is can {{have an effect on}} the severity of the posture. Also whether or not the arm is to the side or across the midpoint of the body should be taken into consideration. When accounting for both the hands and neck, one of these have to come outside their comfortable zone if the hands are supposed to be seen by the user in VR...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} wrist flexion-extension on the median nerve appearance, namely the {{cross-sectional}} area (MNCSA) and the longitudinal (D 1) and vertical (D 2) diameters, was investigated among older adults (N = 34). Ultrasound examination {{was conducted to}} examine the median nerve at different wrist angles (neutral; and 15 °, 30 °, and 45 ° extension and flexion), in both the dominant and nondominant hand. Median nerve behavior {{were significantly associated with}} <b>wrist</b> <b>angle</b> changes. The MNCSA at wrist flexion and extension were significantly smaller (P <. 001) compared with the neutral position in both the dominant and nondominant hand. The D 1 and D 2 were significantly reduced at flexion (P <. 001) and extension (P <. 001), respectively, in both the dominant and nondominant hand. Our results suggest that a larger flexion-extension angle causes higher compression stress on the median nerve, leading to increased deformation of the MNCSA, D 1, and D 2 among older adults...|$|E
40|$|In 2 experiments, {{the effects}} of mental stress on limb {{stiffness}} were investigated. The relative contribution to arm stiffness of individual muscle activity, co-contraction, muscle reflexes, and postural adjustments were examined. In each experiment, participants (N = 24, Experiment 1; N = 16, Experiment 2) held their supinated hand under a tray that {{they were required to}} return to horizontal after it had been suddenly released. Electromyographic activity in the biceps and triceps muscles was recorded, as were elbow and <b>wrist</b> <b>angles</b> and tray displacement. In Experiment 1, mental arithmetic stress was shown to lead to decreased tray displacement (i. e., increased resistance) compared with displacements under the control, unstressed condition, as well as to increased elbow flexion before tray release. In Experiment 2, the increased resistance to perturbation caused by mental stress was found to be independent of initial elbow angle, but to vary {{as a function of the}} amount of upward force exerted before tray release. The authors conclude that stress-induced increases in limb stiffness result from changes in the initial position of the elbow, specified by its angle, together with the initial force exerted by participants to counteract the mechanical perturbations. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to study the association between psychosocial and personality factors, and neck and wrist-hand musculoskeletal complaints, taking account of the occupational factors of force, posture and repetitiveness, and non-occupational risk factors such as sport, hobbies, medical history. METHODS: During personal interviews 133 women from seven different companies, working at constraining workplaces (very repetitive work), answered several questionnaires. These concerned: personal characteristics and history; work characteristics; psychosocial factors (perception and appreciation of the work situation, satisfaction at work, stress symptoms, Karasek questionnaire) and personality factors (neuroticism, conscientiousness, type-A behavior). They also undertook functional and psychomotor tests (<b>wrist</b> <b>angles,</b> grip strength and a dexterity test). Logistic regression models were calculated. RESULTS: Wrist-hand complaints appear to be associated with some personal characteristics (smoking habits, fewer hobbies), work constraints (fewer breaks, heavy lifting efforts) and some personality (introversion) and psychosocial factors (worse appreciation of work). Neck complaints are also associated with some personal characteristics (young people, small, bad health, hormonal problems, fewer hobbies), some personality (urgency of time) and psychosocial factors (constraints as seen by the supervisor). CONCLUSION: The study confirms the multifactorial character of the musculoskeletal disorders and underlines the need for a global ergonomic approach to work situations, taking into account all their physical, psychological and social components...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with how finger, wrist, elbow and shoulder postures are affected depending the orientation and magnitude of hand force exerted. Six participants, 3 females and 3 males from the ages of 18 - 25, where asked to perform three exertions (100 %, 30 % and 10 % MVC) perpendicular to an aluminum plate in 45 ˚, 0 ˚, 45 ˚ and 90 ˚ pitch at elbow height. Exertions were performed using the whole hand and the fingertips. We recorded inter-digit joint angles as {{force is applied to}} compute joint moments, and hand and finger motions {{so that they can be}} modeled and mapped for each condition. Results show that posture changes depending the force exerted and the threshold for significant changes is at force levels below 50 %MVC. Comparing exertions over 50 %MVC with exertions of 50 %MVC or lower, elbow and <b>wrist</b> <b>angles</b> were significantly greater, and forearm was more perpendicular to the surface. Distance between hand and shoulder increases by decreasing the required %MVC. At 0 ˚ pitch males exerted all the required forces using shoulder abduction. Awkward postures, such as shoulder abduction, are some of the contributing factors to develop upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders and must be taken into account while designing tasks...|$|R
