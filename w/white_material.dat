The only denser <b>white</b> <b>material</b> is thorium dioxide, with density of 10 g/cm3, but the thorium it contains is radioactive.|$|E
25|$|Hereford {{originally}} {{played in}} an all-white strip, but their traditional colours are white shirts and black shorts. This {{dates back to}} the end of the Second World War when they used material from blackout curtains to make shorts when they ran out of <b>white</b> <b>material.</b> However, they occasionally reverted to an all-white strip, latterly in the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons. Their away colours varied over the years, with predominantly yellow colours being used in later years.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of phosphorus, the first element {{to be discovered}} that was not known since ancient times, is credited to the German alchemist Hennig Brand in 1669, although other chemists might have discovered phosphorus around the same time. Brand experimented with urine, which contains considerable quantities of dissolved phosphates from normal metabolism. Working in Hamburg, Brand attempted to create the fabled philosopher's stone through the distillation of some salts by evaporating urine, {{and in the process}} produced a <b>white</b> <b>material</b> that glowed in the dark and burned brilliantly. It was named phosphorus mirabilis ("miraculous bearer of light").|$|E

500|$|A yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} {{was observed}} stripping [...] pieces of bark off {{the trunk of}} a dead Leptospermum tree in Acacia melanoxylon swamp near Togari in northwestern Tasmania. It then scraped a layer of <b>white</b> <b>material</b> about 0.5mm thick from the inner surface with its beak. This white layer turned out to be hyphomycete fungi and slime mould that grew in the cambium of the bark.|$|E
500|$|The noted New York fashion {{house of}} Mainbocher {{designed}} the uniforms. Their design services were secured, without cost, {{through the efforts}} of Mrs. James V. Forrestal, wife of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. The winter uniform was made from navy blue wool, worn with a white shirt and dark blue tie. [...] The jacket was single breasted and unbelted, with a six-gored skirt. Included were black oxfords and plain black pumps; a brimmed hat; black gloves; black leather purse, and rain and winter coats. The summer uniform was much the same as the winter uniform, however, it was lighter in weight, made of <b>white</b> <b>material</b> and worn with white shoes. [...] Later, a gray and white striped, seersucker work uniform for summer was added, along with the wearing of slacks and dungarees when appropriate.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the standards development, Akbari {{also contributed to the}} industry for cool roofing materials development. In 2000, suitable cool <b>white</b> <b>materials</b> were available for most roof products, with the notable exception of asphalt shingles; cooler colored materials were needed for all types of roofing. To help fill this gap, Akbari led an effort (sponsored by the California Energy Commission) to work with the roofing industry and developed and produced reflective, colored roofing products.|$|R
2500|$|PTFE was accidentally {{discovered}} in 1938 by Roy Plunkett {{while he was}} working in New Jersey for DuPont. As Plunkett attempted {{to make a new}} chlorofluorocarbon refrigerant, the tetrafluoroethylene gas in its pressure bottle stopped flowing before the bottle's weight had dropped to the point signaling [...] "empty." [...] Since Plunkett was measuring the amount of gas used by weighing the bottle, he became curious as to the source of the weight, and finally resorted to sawing the bottle apart. He found the bottle's interior coated with a waxy <b>white</b> <b>material</b> that was oddly slippery. Analysis showed that it was polymerized perfluoroethylene, with the iron from the inside of the container having acted as a catalyst at high pressure. Kinetic Chemicals patented the new fluorinated plastic (analogous to the already known polyethylene) in 1941, and registered the Teflon trademark in 1945.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} and mid-1950s, acoustic-guitar-accompanied folk songs were mostly heard in coffee houses, private parties, open-air concerts, and sing-alongs, hootenannies, and at college-campus concerts. Often {{associated}} with political dissent, folk music now blended, to some degree, with the so-called beatnik scene; and dedicated singers of folk songs (as well as folk-influenced original material) traveled through what was called [...] "the coffee-house circuit" [...] across the U.S. and Canada, home also to cool jazz and recitations of highly personal beatnik poetry. Two singers of the 1950s who sang folk material but crossed over into the mainstream were Odetta and Harry Belafonte, both of whom sang Lead Belly and Josh <b>White</b> <b>material.</b> Odetta, who had trained as an opera singer, performed traditional blues, spirituals, and songs by Lead Belly. Belafonte had hits with Jamaican calypso material {{as well as the}} folk song-like sentimental ballad [...] "Scarlet Ribbons" [...] (composed in 1949).|$|E
2500|$|In the Orthodox Jewish community, further rituals are {{practices}} toward assurance {{regarding the}} cessation of the menstrual flow. After the hefsek taharah, some women insert a cloth (or, in modern times, a tampon), consequently known as a moch dachuk, for between 18 minutes and an hour, {{to ensure that there}} is absolutely no blood; this must be done carefully, as it could otherwise irritate the mucous membrane, causing bleeding unrelated to menstruation. If there is any fear of irritation causing bleeding, a rabbi may waive this practice. The [...] "bedikah" [...] is repeated each morning and evening of the seven days subsequent to the end of menstruation. Another tradition is the wearing of white underwear and use of white bedding during this period; conversely, the rest of the time, when not counting the [...] "seven clean days", some women who suffer from spotting deliberately use coloured underwear and coloured toilet paper, since it is only when blood is seen on <b>white</b> <b>material</b> that it has any legal status in Jewish law. When not during their seven [...] "clean" [...] days, all women are advised to wear colored undergarments, for this reason. [...] It is furthermore strongly recommended that women make an effort to refrain from looking at the toilet paper after wiping to avoid possible resultant questions.|$|E
5000|$|The most attractive, durable polytarp sails {{are usually}} {{made from a}} heavier <b>white</b> polytarp <b>material.</b> Generally, polysails are made from <b>white</b> ultraviolet-protected (UV-protected) <b>material</b> that is 12-16 mils thick (1 mil is [...]001 inches) and weighs about 6-8 ounces per square yard—about twice the weight and {{thickness}} of the common colored tarps which usually have no UV protection.|$|R

50|$|Correction paper, or {{correction}} film, its plastic based equivalent, is a tab {{of plastic}} with one side coated with <b>white</b> correction <b>material.</b> It {{is used to}} correct typing errors made when using a typewriter. When inserted between the paper and the ribbon, the impression of the typebar presses {{the shape of the}} character into the film, which prints the <b>white</b> correction <b>material</b> onto the paper, hiding the erroneous character and preparing the document for the correct character.|$|R

50|$|The Original Board. When {{the board}} was {{organized}} in 1915, A. G. Daniells served as president. The secretaryship, after being held {{for a short time}} by C. C. Crisler, passed to W. C. White, {{the only member of the}} board devoting full-time to the work of the trustees. He filled this office until his death in 1937. From 1915 to 1937 the work was carried on at Elmshaven in a rented office building with a vault that was used to house the E. G. <b>White</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|R
50|$|In cinematography, {{butterflies}} (also {{known as}} overheads) are structures on which materials are mounted so to control lighting {{in a scene}} or photograph. Materials commonly used on butterflies include: flags (black, opaque materials), nets (layers of neutral-colored bobinette), and diffusions (translucent <b>white</b> <b>materials</b> of different densities) {{for the purposes of}} blocking, dimming, and scattering light respectively. In general, butterflies are used only for very large materials (6 ft x 6 ft or greater), while smaller sizes are usually sewn on to portable frames (similar in construction to picture frames) for ease of placement and storage.|$|R
60|$|She was tall, and gowned in {{some simple}} <b>white</b> <b>material</b> that fell {{about her in}} graceful folds. She wore a cluster of pale pink roses at her belt, and a big, picturesque white hat shaded her face and the glossy, {{clinging}} masses of her red hair--hair that was neither auburn nor chestnut but simply red. Nor would anyone have wished it otherwise, having once seen that glorious mass, with all its wonderful possibilities of rippling luxuriance.|$|E

It was a fragment of white embroidery, and on it were several small stains. The Inspector looked at them and looked at his fingers. His face grew suddenly grave.|$|E
6000|$|But {{in costume}} and {{appearance}} these soldiers were what is familiarly known as [...] "a queer lot!" [...] The {{uniform of the}} rank and file consisted of a tunic and trousers of <b>white</b> <b>material,</b> with a narrow-brimmed straw hat painted white, cross-belts and cartouche-box--by no means an unbecoming dress. But it was worn only at drills and reviews and state ceremonies. At other times, when on duty, soldiers went about almost naked, and the contrast of their dirty-white cross-belts with their brown breasts was curious, to say the least, while their straw hats and slovenly gait suggested anything but soldierly bearing.|$|E

50|$|In the {{presence}} of sunlight the surface temperature of an object is usually considerably higher than {{the temperature of the}} air. Solar absorptivity is closely related to color, varying from about 20% for <b>white</b> <b>materials</b> to 90% for black materials; thus samples of different colors will reach different on-exposure temperatures. Because the thermal conductivity and heat capacity of polymeric materials are generally low, much higher temperatures can be obtained on the surface than in the bulk of the material. Therefore, both the surface temperatures of the samples, produced largely by infrared radiation absorption which varies by material color, and ambient air temperature and its fluctuations during exposure do play a role.|$|R
