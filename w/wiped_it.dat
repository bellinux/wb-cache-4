5|$|Nilin reluctantly {{goes along}} with Edge's next plan: to remix the CEO of Memorize, Scylla Cartier-Wells, to make her see the harm her company's {{technology}} is causing. Nilin makes her way into Scylla's office and enters her mind, remixing {{the memory of a}} car crash which left her with a bitter taste against the world. As she changes the memory to make Scylla a more compassionate person, Nilin discovers that she is Scylla's daughter. Nilin is then told by Edge to head for the Bastille basements to save Bad Request, who has been taken captive. She finds Bad Request, but discovers that his memory has been fully <b>wiped.</b> <b>It</b> is revealed that Memorize scientist Doctor Quaid means to control the Leapers through their Sensens and thus breed a private army for Memorize. However, Johnny Greenteeth, a former co-worker of Quaid's who was experimented on and turned into a Leaper, kills Quaid and prepares to self-destruct the Bastille. Bad Request helps Nilin take down Johnny at the cost of his life and Nilin escapes the destroyed facility.|$|E

25|$|Flooding {{had been}} a serious problem {{through most of the}} city’s history, due to the area’s steep compact hillsides. In 1760 and 1780 two major floods nearly <b>wiped</b> <b>it</b> out. This spurred {{construction}} of large ditches and tunnels to contain and divert overflows during the rainy season. These eventually crisscrossed {{a large part of the}} city. Dam construction in the 1960s brought the flooding under control, and many of the ditches and tunnels were converted into underground roadways.|$|E

500|$|Mostly unconcerned about {{appearance}} and manners, biographers suggest {{she focused on}} her studies. A distinguished algebraist Olga Taussky-Todd described a luncheon, during which Noether, wholly engrossed {{in a discussion of}} mathematics, [...] "gesticulated wildly" [...] as she ate and [...] "spilled her food constantly and <b>wiped</b> <b>it</b> off from her dress, completely unperturbed". Appearance-conscious students cringed as she retrieved the handkerchief from her blouse and ignored the increasing disarray of her hair during a lecture. Two female students once approached her during a break in a two-hour class to express their concern, but they were unable to break through the energetic mathematics discussion she was having with other students.|$|E
500|$|Jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli and {{classical}} violinist Yehudi Menuhin were performing in another {{studio in the}} building, and were invited to record a piece for the new album. Menuhin watched as Grappelli played on the song [...] "Wish You Were Here"; however, the band later decided his contribution was unsuitable and, until 2011, {{it was believed that}} the piece had been <b>wiped.</b> <b>It</b> turns out his playing was included on the album, but so low in the final mix that the band presumed it would be insulting to credit him. He was paid £300 for his contribution (equivalent to £ in [...] ). Dick Parry again played saxophone, on [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond". The opening bars of [...] "Wish You Were Here" [...] were recorded from Gilmour's car radio, with somebody turning the dial (the classical music heard is the finale of Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony).|$|E
500|$|In Mozambique, the RNR {{encountered}} Lettow-Vorbeck's supply column near Mtarika on 22 May 1918. It <b>wiped</b> <b>it</b> out (capturing two German officers, two German askaris, 34 Portuguese askaris and 252 carriers), but as {{the supply}} column had been marching between the main German column and its rearguard, Lettow-Vorbeck was then able to attack the RNR from both sides. The contact lasted until darkness fell, and the RNR held its position. Lettow-Vorbeck then moved further south, with the RNR following. This pursuit continued {{for the rest of}} the war, with Lettow-Vorbeck avoiding contacts so far as was possible and constantly resupplying his men by briefly occupying isolated towns. The RNR chased the German column for over [...] around Mozambique and the eastern districts of Northern Rhodesia, but never caught up with him. After Lettow-Vorbeck formally surrendered at Abercorn on 25 November 1918, the RNR returned to Salisbury, where the men were discharged during 1919. The regiment existed on paper for two more years before it was formally disbanded in February 1921.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} my fury and your insult are too {{shocking}} to {{be wiped out}} even with an apology," [...] said Gregory very calmly. [...] "No duel could <b>wipe</b> <b>it</b> out. If I struck you dead I could not <b>wipe</b> <b>it</b> out. There {{is only one way}} by which that insult can be erased, and that way I choose. I am going, at the possible sacrifice of my life and honour, to prove to you that you were wrong in what you said." ...|$|R

500|$|During {{a typical}} Polish {{coronation}} ceremony {{in the times}} of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the king-elect received Szczerbiec after his anointment and before being crowned and enthroned. The primate of Poland, that is the archbishop of Gniezno, picked up the unsheathed sword from the altar {{and handed it to}} the kneeling king. At the same time, he recited a formula which asked the monarch to use the sword to rule justly, defend the Church, fight evil, protect widows and orphans, and to [...] "rebuild what is damaged, maintain what is rebuilt, avenge what is unjust, reinforce what is well managed," [...] etc. Then, the king handed the sword to the Crown sword-bearer (miecznik koronny), who slid it into the scabbard and passed on to the primate. The primate, aided by the Crown and Lithuanian sword-bearers, fastened the scabbard to the king's belt. The king stood up and, facing onlookers, withdrew Szczerbiec, made three times {{the sign of the cross}} with it, and <b>wiped</b> <b>it</b> against his left arm before replacing it in the scabbard. The king's sword-wielding abilities were closely watched by his new subjects during this part of the ritual. When Augustus III betrayed his poor fencing skills at his coronation, nobles joked that they were going to have [...] "a peaceful lord". After Szczerbiec, a bishop handed the sovereign the Grunwald Swords symbolizing the monarch's reign over the two constituent nations of the Commonwealth.|$|E

2500|$|Conflicts with American Indians doomed {{several other}} early Virginia towns. Henricus (also known as [...] "Henricopolis") {{is now a}} {{historic}} site in Chesterfield County. In the early 17th century, it was a boom town with an emerging school system until the Indian Massacre of 1622 <b>wiped</b> <b>it</b> out, along with Wolstenholme Towne on Martin's Hundred Plantation downriver from Jamestown in James City County.|$|E
6000|$|His {{blood was}} up. His danger only nerved him to action, so he says. So he planted {{a dab of}} {{vermilion}} in his creature's mouth. The Italian spluttered and tried to <b>wipe</b> <b>it</b> off--evidently horribly surprised. And then--according to Harringay--there began a very remarkable struggle, Harringay splashing away with the red paint, and the picture wriggling about and <b>wiping</b> <b>it</b> off {{as fast as he}} put it on. [...] "Two masterpieces," [...] said the demon. [...] "Two indubitable masterpieces for a Chelsea artist's soul. It's a bargain?" [...] Harringay replied with the paint brush.|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the canonical account in the Gospel of Luke, the apocryphal Arabic Infancy Gospel contains the first reference {{to the survival of}} Christ's severed foreskin. The second chapter has the following story: [...] "And when the time of his circumcision was come, namely, the eighth day, on which the law commanded the child to be circumcised, they circumcised him in a cave. And the old Hebrew woman took the foreskin (others say she took the navel-string), and preserved it in an alabaster-box of old oil of spikenard. And she had a son who was a druggist, to whom she said, [...] "Take heed thou sell not this alabaster box of spikenard-ointment, although thou shouldst be offered three hundred pence for it. Now this is that alabaster-box which Mary the sinner procured, and poured forth the ointment out of it upon the head and feet of our Lord Jesus Christ, and <b>wiped</b> <b>it</b> off with the hairs of her head".|$|E
2500|$|... "The Twist" [...] had {{previously}} peaked at #16 on the Billboard {{rhythm and blues}} chart, in the 1959 version recorded by its author, Hank Ballard, whose band The Midnighters first performed the dance on stage. Checker's [...] "Twist", however, was a nationwide smash, aided by his many appearances on Dick Clark's American Bandstand, the Top 10 American Bandstand ranking of the song, and the teenagers on the show who enjoyed dancing the Twist. The song was so ubiquitous that Checker felt that his critics thought that he could only succeed with dance records typecasting him as a dance artist. Checker later lamented:"...in a way, [...] "The Twist" [...] really ruined my life. I {{was on my way}} to becoming a big nightclub performer, and [...] "The Twist" [...] just <b>wiped</b> <b>it</b> out... It got so out of proportion. No one ever believes I have talent." [...] By 1965 alone, [...] "The Twist" [...] had sold over 15 million copies, and was awarded multiple gold discs by the RIAA.|$|E
2500|$|Thirty-two {{years after}} she resigned, Vanessa Williams {{returned}} to the Miss America stage on September 13, 2015, for the Miss America 2016 pageant as head judge (where Miss Georgia 2015, Betty Cantrell, won the crown). The pageant began with Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issuing an apology to Williams, telling her that although [...] "none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, I want to apologize {{to you and to}} your mother, Miss Helen Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made you feel any less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be." [...] Suzette Charles (Williams' replacement) {{said in an interview with}} Inside Edition that she was perplexed over the apology and suggested that it was given for the purpose of ratings. Williams also commented on the events surrounding her return, stating in an interview with Robin Roberts that [...] "there's a lot of people who feel I should return, so the people who harbor the resentment I understand it but realize that all of those people that were part of the old guard are no longer there." [...] In the same interview, Roberts mentioned to Williams that in the present day (c. 2015), [...] "people now release [...] things to make a career." [...] Williams responded: [...] "That's crazy. To think that oh you can look at a scandal and think that that would be good for your career, where for me it took every ounce of credibility and talent that I had and <b>wiped</b> <b>it</b> out." ...|$|E
