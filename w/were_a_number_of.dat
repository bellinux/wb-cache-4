5|$|Between 1853 and 1862, there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> uprisings {{against the}} Brooke {{government}} but all were successfully contained {{with the aid}} of local tribes. To guard against future uprisings, a series of forts were constructed to protect Kuching, including Fort Margherita, completed in 1871. By that time Brooke's control of Sarawak was such that defences were largely unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the {{algorithms}} meant that some calculations, such as arccos0.2, could take up to 15 seconds, whereas the HP-35 was designed to complete calculations in under a second. Accuracy in scientific functions was also limited to around three digits at most, and there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> bugs and limitations.|$|E
5|$|The major {{excavation}} {{of the site}} {{in the winter of}} 2004–05 concentrated on the building and a 10m (33ft) zone surrounding it. The results indicated that there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> phases of occupation. The remains of the building were reburied after excavation, so nothing is now visible at the surface.|$|E

5|$|These {{fears were}} to prove {{justified}} as, during the line's {{first month of}} operation, there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> well-publicised problems ranging from overcrowding resulting in passengers standing for the whole journey to timekeeping difficulties due to excessive dwell times at stations. Furthermore, signalling problems led to disruption on the line nearly a month after opening.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this work}} we propose an {{approach}} to prioritizing order of transmission of sensed data in wireless sensor network that are very popular in, for example, environmental monitoring. The approach is based on determination of a consensus relation which is in "nearest distance " from all initial rankings shaped by multiple sensors of each network node. Statistically and probabilistically based analytical models useful for assuring network performance and providing reasonable number values n – k and m are proposed and discussed, where n – k <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> packets transmitted to the sink; n <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the network sensor nodes; k <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> dropped packets due to a congestion; and m <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> node sensors (or rankings) ...|$|R

5|$|These {{victories}} ensured Argentine {{authority in}} the northwest and stopped the royalist advance into the central territory. Although there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> colonialist 'invasions' from Upper Peru until 1821, Belgrano's campaign is widely considered the decisive one.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} players left the club {{following}} the end of the 2005–06 season. Senior players John Anderson, who had been assistant manager to Paul Trollope during his spell as caretaker manager the previous year, Ali Gibb, Jon Bass and Christian Edwards were released, while Jamie Forrester moved to Lincoln City on a free transfer. Also leaving the club <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> younger players who had failed to earn extensions to their contracts. These were Mark Preece, Matt Thorne, Ben Willshire and goalkeepers Ryan Clarke and Martin Horsell.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{adoption}} of Christianity in territory, which is today Poland, there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> different a pagan tribes. Svetovid {{was among the most}} widespread pagan gods worshiped in Poland. Christianity arrived around the late 9th century, most likely around the time when the Vistulan tribe encountered the Christian rite in dealings with their neighbors, the Great Moravia (Bohemian) state.|$|E

5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it. When I joined the Regiment I {{was told that}} the best way to survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who you thought you would like to be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E
5|$|Besides, there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> small posterns. The {{heads and}} limbs of {{executed}} criminals were regularly displayed above the ports. Of the six ports, the Netherbow {{was the only}} one which took the form of a large fortified gateway. Repairs to the Netherbow are recorded in 1538, and a drawing of 1544 shows the Netherbow as a wide arched gate flanked by two round towers. In 1571, the gateway between the towers was rebuilt, and a central clock tower was added above the gateway, topped by an octagonal stone spire. This structure was repaired in the early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Followers of Hinduism {{were also}} present {{to some extent}} during the Anuradhapura Kingdom. There <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> them in Rajarata during Elara's reign. Mahasen {{destroyed}} several Hindu temples during his reign in the 2nd century. Particularly Indian merchant communities living near ports such as Mahatittha and Gokanna were followers of Hinduism and Hindu temples were constructed in these areas. By {{the end of the}} Anuradhapura Kingdom, large Hindu temples such as the Konesvaram temple had been constructed. Historical sources indicate that there were also Jains in Anuradhapura during the reign of Valagamba.|$|E

5|$|For {{hundreds}} of years mining was an important industry for the area, and there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> mines in Midsomer Norton, e.g. Old Mills, Norton Hill, and Welton. However the seams were thin and with the hilly nature around, not easily worked. Generations of miners {{who worked in the}} difficult conditions of the local collieries are remembered at the Radstock Museum. The coming of the railways, particularly the Bath extension of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S) in 1874, transformed the conveyance of coal out of the area.|$|E
5|$|In November 2007, a Hyderabad-based company named Goldstone Technologies {{acquired}} the film negative rights of fourteen Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including Mayabazar (1957) and Malliswari, to release their digitally remastered versions in colour. Though the digitally remastered and colourised version of Mayabazar, released in January 2010, was commercially successful, Goldstone Technologies {{decided not to}} remaster the remaining fourteen films including Malliswari, saying {{that most of the}} producers who sold the rights of the negatives to TV channels lost control over them. Goldstone said furthermore that there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> legal issues over ownership and copyright issues whenever other producers try to do something on their own.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the township, there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> temporary camps established for construction workers. It was initially intended that the construction workers should live off-site, but the poor condition of the roads and a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting long and difficult, and in turn {{made it difficult to}} find and retain workers. Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The largest, the trailer camp at Gamble Valley, had four thousand units. Another, at Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. The population of the construction camps declined as the construction effort tapered off, but they continued to be occupied in 1946.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years at Croydon, girls tended to be {{enrolled}} at an older age, typically over fourteen. It was apparent that despite Marden's insistence, many parents viewed the College as a finishing school. As today, {{it was not a}} requirement for students to be Presbyterians, and early school records indicate there <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Roman Catholic and Jewish students. By 1900 the reputation of the school had spread, and pupils were starting to come from a wider geographic area, including New Caledonia, Fiji, New Zealand, the Northern Territory, Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia.|$|E
5|$|Kobayashi {{allowed the}} voice actors who voiced his {{characters}} significant freedom to interpret {{them as they}} chose. There <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> cast changes throughout the production; Ami Koshimizu, the voice actress for Tenma, had initially auditioned {{for the role of}} Yakumo, and between School Rumbles first and second seasons the voice actors for both Karen Ichijo and Yoko Sasakura were replaced. Mako Sakurai took over Karen's role from Yuuka Nanri, and Aya Hirano replaced Akiko Kurumado as Yoko.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{transport}} units were also formed. Not required at Gallipoli, {{they were sent}} on to the Western Front, becoming the first units of the AIF to serve there. The motor transport rejoined I ANZAC Corps when it reached the Western Front in 1916. Australia also formed six railway operating companies, which served on the Western Front. Specialist ordnance units included ammunition and mobile workshops units formed late in the war, while service units included supply columns, ammunition sub-parks, field bakeries and butcheries, and depot units. Hospitals and other specialist medical and dental units were also formed in Australia and overseas, as <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> convalescent depots.|$|E
