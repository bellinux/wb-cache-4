5|$|According to the report, {{the average}} annual {{transfers}} from the national government to the municipalities for <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> (including solid waste) were about US$278m between 1998 and 2001. 86% of that funding was allocated through the SGP as defined in Law 715. A certain percentage of these resources was dedicated exclusively for <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanitation.</b> They mainly go to small municipalities that show low income levels. Nevertheless, many municipalities use funding through SGP dedicated for <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> for other purposes.|$|E

5|$|<b>Water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> in Zimbabwe {{is defined}} by many small scale {{successful}} programs but also by {{a general lack of}} improved water and sanitation systems for the majority of Zimbabwe. According to the World Health Organization in 2012, 80% of Zimbabweans had access to improved, i.e. clean, drinking-water sources, and only 40% of Zimbabweans had access to improved sanitation facilities. Access to improved <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> is distinctly less in rural areas.|$|E

50|$|Standpipes <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> are {{provided}} in most developing areas, but the death rates are not significantly reduced. One {{of the reasons that}} water-related diseases are still occurring is because <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> can be contacted by contaminated surface water. To effectively decrease the morbidity and mortality of diseases, the population should get access to water from home instead from outside. Therefore, in addition to the installation of standpipes, <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> should be provided within houses.|$|R
50|$|In {{a region}} already {{suffering}} severe water stress, the ongoing political, {{economic and social}} crisis in the oPt has resulted in near catastrophic consequences for the water, <b>sanitation</b> <b>and</b> hygiene (WaSH) situation. Local and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in the water sector, {{in tandem with the}} Palestinian Water Authority (PWA), are trying, under restrictive political conditions and within limited budgets, to ensure that all Palestinians are able to access sufficient <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> services.|$|R

5|$|<b>Water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> in Japan {{is facing}} some challenges, {{such as a}} {{decreasing}} population, declining investment, fiscal constraints, ageing facilities, an ageing workforce, a fragmentation of service provision among thousands of municipal utilities, and the vulnerability of {{parts of the country}} to droughts that are expected to become more frequent due to climate change.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 Inventario Sanitario Rural (ISR) or Rural Sanitary Register {{confirms}} that situation.

However, the Times says that it will be by the presence, or absence, of a headline figure on overall African aid that their talks will be judged a success or failure. Fukuda and Brown are reported to be pressing for the fulfillment of pledges made at the 2005 Gleneagles summit, but Sarkozy and Berlusconi are seen to be for pulling back from those commitments.|$|R
5|$|<b>Water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> in Colombia {{has been}} {{improved}} {{in many ways}} over the past decades. Between 1990 and 2010, access to improved sanitation increased from 67% to 82%, but access to improved water source's increased only slightly from 89% to 94%. In particular, coverage in rural areas lags behind. Furthermore, despite improvements, the quality of water and sanitation services remains inadequate. For example, only 73% of those receiving public services receive water of potable quality and in 2006 only 25% of the wastewater generated in the country underwent any kind of treatment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> in Turkey is characterised by {{achievements}} and challenges. Over the past decades access to drinking water {{has become almost}} universal and access to adequate sanitation has also increased substantially. Autonomous utilities have been created in the 16 metropolitan cities of Turkey and cost recovery has been increased, thus providing {{the basis for the}} sustainability of service provision. Intermittent supply, which was common in many cities, has become less frequent. In 2004, 61% of the wastewater collected through sewers was being treated. Remaining challenges include the need to further increase wastewater treatment, to reduce the high level of non-revenue water hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate sanitation in rural areas. The investment required to comply with EU standards in the sector, especially in wastewater treatment, is estimated to be in the order of €2 billion per year, more than double the current level of investment.|$|E

25|$|A first {{distinction}} {{should be}} made between <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> responsibilities in (i) urban areas and (ii) rural areas.

25|$|The legal {{framework}} for <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>sanitation</b> {{is based on}} the <b>Water</b> <b>Supply</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sanitation</b> Act Nr. 12 enacted in May 2009.
