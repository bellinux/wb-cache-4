Charles initiated contact with Sixtus through contacts in neutral Switzerland, and Zita wrote a letter inviting him to Vienna. Zita's mother Maria Antonia delivered the letter in person.|$|E

Responding to a question by the opposition, {{the leader of the}} house announced the results publicly while explaining the delay in publication due to the UK–US agreement. The UK press interpreted this differently, claiming that the US <b>was</b> <b>dragging</b> its feet because it was unable to replicate the British results.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} watch before dawn, they {{attacked}} {{the guards and}} the sleeping Spaniards, killing most of them, although a few escaped by swimming or in the galley's tender. Upon hearing the commotion, Governor Dasmariñas, thinking that the galley <b>was</b> <b>dragging</b> and the men were taking to the oars, carelessly left his cabin bareheaded. He was killed by several Chinese waiting outside the door. Two Spaniards, Juan de Cuellar, the governor's secretary, and Franciscan Father Montilla, survived by remaining in their cabin amidships. They were later released ashore by the rebels.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Star of Bengals crew {{also became}} concerned, but could neither see the tugboats, nor {{communicate}} with them. At 1:45a.m. the Hattie Gage blew {{a series of}} whistles, signaling the maneuver which was heard on the Star of Bengal. However, as the tugs started the turn, the Kayaks rudder proved ineffective in the rough weather, and she failed to turn into the wind. For some time, the tugs worked against each other, their combined effort overpowering the Star of Bengals rudder and preventing her from making the turn to safety. Aware of the looming danger, the Star of Bengals first mate begged captain Wagner to sever the Kayaks hawser which <b>was</b> <b>dragging</b> the ship in the wrong direction, but the captain refused, as the maritime law prohibited such action {{on the part of}} the vessel in tow.|$|E
25|$|In {{the main}} event cage match wrestlers could escape the cage and thus unmasking only by {{climbing}} {{over the top of}} the cage and all the way to the floor. The first escapee was Coco Armarillo who climbed over the top within minutes of the opening bell. When Máscara Sagrada Jr. tried to escape the Killer, the real one this time, climbed up the cage from the outside and pushed Máscara Sagrada Jr. off the top of the cage, back inside the ring. A few minutes later Coco Azul was able to leave the cage as well, leaving his two partners at a four-on-two disadvantage in the cage. During the match Máscara Sagrada tried to even the sides as he tried to prevent the Killer from interfering on several occasions. When Tinieblas Jr. climbed the cage the Killer tried to stop him as he had done before, but this time Tinieblas Jr. was able to knock Killer down and become the third man to leave the cage, moments later Máscara Sagrada Jr. also left the cage. At this point Lady Victoria, who was siding with Los Payasos and Karis locked Miss Janeth to the cage with a pair of handcuffs. Blue Demon Jr. managed to kick a chair into the face of Karis La Momia and then use the break in the action to climb {{over the top of the}} cage to the floor. When the match came down to Karis La Momia and Halcón Dorado Jr. Máscarita Sagráda Jr. ran to ringside to help his regular-sized friends out, helping unlock the handcuffs used on Miss Janeth. Looking to help out the diminutive Mini-Estrella climbed up the outside of the cage and dove off the top. He intended to hit Karis La Momia, but at the last moment Karis moved and Máscarita Sagráda Jr. landed on Halcón Dorado Jr. instead. Karis use the opening to handcuff Máscarita Sagráda Jr. to Halcón Dorado Jr., then began to climb the cage, when Halcón Dorado Jr. tried to stop him he was slowed down by the fact that he <b>was</b> <b>dragging</b> Máscarita Sagráda Jr. behind him, making him too late to stop Karis from leaving the cage. After the match a frustrated Halcón Dorado Jr. revealed that his real name was Antonio Olmos, then angrily pulled his mask off and attacked Máscarita Sagráda Jr. and Máscara Sagráda Jr. blaming them for his mask loss.|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel <b>was</b> <b>dragging</b> his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E

From their arrival on October 12, 1686, until March, 1687, when Nicholas' case against his brother was finally ready for trial, they remained in confinement. Here, {{as in the case}} of Milan, a commission was appointed, and although a number of petty irregularities and cases of tampering with accounts were found, Adolph Esmit was on November 2, 1687, given a verdict of not guilty.|$|E

Aaron had {{to be brought to}} the hospital for surgery. He was hospitalized for well over three weeks. For four months the other three members of Fahrenheit had to attend overseas album promotions and functions without Aaron. The Taiwanese media then composed rumors saying that Aaron was a disadvantage to the group and that he <b>was</b> <b>dragging</b> the group behind, which would cause disbandment. More rumors surfaced saying that HIM was planning to dispose of Aaron so Fahrenheit could become a group of three instead of four, therefore complementing more with the prefabricated trio S.H.E. However, Fahrenheit stepped out and confirmed that Aaron is still in the group despite his inconvenient condition. To prevent more rumors from happening, as soon as Aaron was available he appeared more often in the future promotions with the other members, clearly seen using crutches.|$|E
