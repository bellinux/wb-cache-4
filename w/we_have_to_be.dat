In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{equipment}} {{rotation and}} maintenance concerns, Caltrain said in 2009 {{that it could}} not dedicate cars with higher bike capacity on trains with high bike demand. Many of you have written to ask a series of questions about this new effort: Why can’t we provide two bike cars on every train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on my train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on the most heavily used trains? Why is there only one bike car on trains that are supposed to have two bike cars? The simplest answer to most of these questions is that we don’t have enough bike cars to put two on every train, or even on every peak train, and, in doing all we can to expand service for our cycling customers, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mindful of the impact of these changes on our entire system and all of our customers, particularly on on-time performance. All of our cars, not just our bike cars, serve our entire schedule throughout our entire day, which means they rotate through the schedule, and also must be rotated out of service for fueling, washing, maintenance and federally mandated safety and operational inspections. A train set that starts its day in San Jose may finish its day in Millbrae and be cycled to San Francisco for its daily maintenance and to begin the next day at the San Francisco station. Because of this rotation – because of the demands of our entire service schedule – we can’t guarantee that a specific stop on the schedule will have a specific train.}} Eventually, two bike cars were added to every train consist by 2011, and in 2016, a third bike car was added to Bombardier consists.|$|E

500|$|The Hergé Foundation has {{maintained}} {{control of the}} licenses, through Moulinsart, the commercial wing of the foundation.

500|$|In contrast, the {{narrative}} surrounding Fox has been critiqued as illustrating the media's focus on stereotyped portrayals {{of the heroic}} and extraordinary achievements of people with disabilities, rather than more mundane accomplishments. Actor Alan Toy noted [...] "Sure, it raised money for cancer research and sure it showed the human capacity for achievement. But a lot of disabled people are made to feel like failures if they haven't done something extraordinary. They may be bankers or factory workers– proof enough of their usefulness to society. Do <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 'supercrips' {{in order to be}} valid? And if we're not super, are we invalid?" [...] The media's idealization of Fox has also been critiqued for emphasizing an individualistic approach to illness and disability, in which the body is a machine to be mastered, rather than the social model of disability, where societal attitudes and barriers to inclusion play a prominent role in determining who is disabled.|$|E
500|$|In October 2006, Sam Roberts, the Guerilla Gamemaker Competition {{director}} of the Slamdance festival, emailed Ledonne encouraging him to submit the game to the contest. Ledonne looked at {{the selection of the}} game as one of the competition's finalists in December as evidence that [...] "all forms of art can be valid tools for societal exploration (even painful topics like school shootings)". The event's organizer, Peter Baxter, announced the removal of the game from the festival's [...] "Guerrilla Gamemaker Competition" [...] after its selection as a finalist. Several reasons for the change of mind were given, including threatened sponsor withdrawal, possible lawsuits, and [...] "moral grounds"; Baxter denied that sponsor pressure caused the drop, instead affirming that [...] "the shootings are still a very touchy subject, and rightly so. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sensitive to [...] feelings." [...] An additional consideration reported was that unnamed parties might sue for copyright violations in the game itself. The announcement marked the first time the festival had pulled jury-selected content from the contest; the incident was dubbed [...] "Slamgate" [...] by the gaming press.|$|E
30|$|A note {{concerning}} {{the interpretation of}} “anticipation” in our analysis: Narrowly defined, anticipation refers to expecting a new situation, here to being self-employed. However, with our data at hand we <b>were</b> not able <b>to</b> distinguish whether higher or lower job satisfaction before that event was caused by anticipation in this narrow sense or also due to other aspects. Thus <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cautious in interpreting the near situation before self-employment as anticipation only in its narrow sense. So, in the following we use the term anticipation (as Clark et al. 2008, p.  230 did) in a broader sense which also captures other influences, including the above-mentioned motivational aspects for dynamics in job satisfaction prior to becoming self-employed.|$|R

500|$|The {{production}} team maintained heavily enforced security around the film. Karl Urban revealed, [...] " [...] {{level of security}} and secrecy that we have all been forced to adopt.

We're not allowed to walk around in public in our costumes and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> herded around everywhere in these golf carts that are completely concealed and covered in black canvas. The security of it is immense. You feel your freedom is a big challenge." [...] Actors like Jennifer Morrison were only given the scripts of their scenes. The film's shooting script was fiercely protected even with the main cast. Simon Pegg said, [...] "I read [...] with a security guard near me – it's that secretive." [...] The film used the fake working title of Corporate Headquarters. Some of the few outside of the production allowed to visit the set included Rod Roddenberry, Ronald D. Moore, Jonathan Frakes, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, Ben Stiller, Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg (who had partially convinced Abrams to direct because he liked the script, and he even advised the action scenes during his visit).|$|E
500|$|Liverpool midfielder Vladimír Šmicer {{was looking}} forward to playing a part in the final: [...] "Everyone wants to play in the final, I'm no different. I was just happy to be on the pitch against Auxerre because I didn't know even the day before whether I'd be fit enough after my injury problem. I'm still not 100% fit, I just wanted to train well this week and be fit for the final." [...] Šmicer was hopeful that victory in the final would rescue Liverpool's season: [...] "I hope that this re-ignites our season. Our season is not good, we know, but there is still plenty to play for. We have not said this is a bad season, let's forget about it and {{concentrate}} on the next one, we have been criticised and we are intent on responding on the pitch." [...] Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy was eager to win the match: [...] "Winning in Cardiff would be a massive result for us, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> honest, we haven't been as good as Manchester United over the last 10 years. And winning would bring European football next year, which isn't guaranteed at the moment." ...|$|E

Shiller drove a cab, worked as a waitress and free lance photographer, and got involved in radical politics. With one of Chicago's most controversial political organizers, Walter [...] "Slim" [...] Coleman, Shiller helped organize the Intercommunal Survival Committee, a sort of white support arm of the Black Panther Party.

[...] "We must have the frame of mind that as revolutionaries <b>we</b> <b>have</b> (<b>to)</b> <b>be</b> able to solve any problem that comes our way..." [...] Shiller said. The Coalition provided an array of programs geared toward providing essential services for the poor, including medical clinics for pregnant women, mothers and young children; a legal aid clinic, food pantries and distributing clothes and meals to the poor. For decades Shiller and her allies worked to preserve Uptown as the last North Side lakefront neighborhood south of Rogers Park {{that is home to}} a significant population of low income households.|$|E
