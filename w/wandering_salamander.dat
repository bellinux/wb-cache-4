50|$|The <b>wandering</b> <b>{{salamander}}</b> (Aneides vagrans) is {{a species}} of salamander in the family Plethodontidae. It is found in Canada and the United States. Its natural habitat is temperate forests. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>wandering</b> <b>salamander</b> {{is listed}} as [...] "Near {{threatened}}" [...] in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This is because numbers seem to be declining and its habitat is threatened by changes in logging practices whereby there is less cut forest with large amounts of woody debris.|$|E
50|$|Trees in {{the stand}} were {{measured}} with tapes and laser range finders. Over 20 days with 5 climbers was spent just in measuring the Iluvatar tree. Scientific studies {{were done with}} moisture, light, and sap flow sensors. Wildlife in the grove was studied too, including the <b>Wandering</b> <b>salamander</b> (Aneides vagrans).|$|E
5000|$|Rivers {{of liquid}} fire feed and emerge {{from at least}} two massive lakes where the flames burn brightest. This fiery [...] "water" [...] is {{inhabited}} by numerous <b>wandering</b> <b>salamanders</b> that {{were brought to the}} layer in days long past, to be bound in servitude to the master of the plane. Given that salamanders are not prone to taking orders, this didn't work out, and most were slain by Belial's servants and vassals. Those few who escaped remain bound to Phlegethos by Belial's magic, and continue to survive by avoiding large groups of baatezu and snatching lone individuals who venture too close to one of the fiery rivers.|$|R
50|$|Salamanders. A {{number of}} North American forest-dwelling {{climbing}} salamanders have prehensile tails {{that help them}} climb. Some are from the genus Aneides such as the clouded salamander (Aneides ferreus), the <b>wandering</b> <b>salamander</b> (Aneides vagrans), and the arboreal salamander (Aneides lugubris). Others are the large Red Hills salamander (Phaeognathus hubrichti) and the cave salamander (Eurycea lucifuga). There are also the Central American Bolitoglossa sombra and Mexican and Central American Bolitoglossa mexicana salamanders.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wandering</b> <b>salamander</b> {{climbs up}} to forty metres (yards) in the {{branches}} of trees. It feeds at night on small invertebrates such as ants, mites, adult beetles and their larvae, snails, springtails and woodlice. During the day it hides under fallen trees, under rocks, in crevices, under bark and in rotten wood. It has no lungs or gills, and breathes through its skin. For this reason it must keep moist at all times. In California it may aestivate in summer and be active in winter while in Vancouver Island it may be active in summer and hibernate in winter.|$|E
50|$|The clouded {{salamander}} {{has traditionally}} been thought to have a range that extended from northern California through Oregon and north to Vancouver Island, but it is absent {{from the state of}} Washington. In 1998, Jackson examined the mitochondrial DNA and allozymes of populations from various parts of the range and determined that those from California and Vancouver Island were similar but were distinct from the populations found in Oregon. He named the species from the two extremities as Aneides vagrans, the <b>wandering</b> <b>salamander,</b> while retaining the name Aneides ferreus for the Oregon population. It seems likely that A. vagrans arrived in Vancouver Island during the nineteenth century {{as the result of the}} import of large sheets of tan oak bark from California for the tanning industry. In the next century the salamander spread to nearly all the small offshore islets round Vancouver Island, probably on rafts of logs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wandering</b> <b>salamander</b> is {{very similar}} in {{appearance}} to the clouded salamander (Aneides ferreus) and was at one time {{considered to be the}} same species. It is long and slender and grows to a snout to vent length of 3 in and a total length of 5 in. The head is broader in males than in females. Between the nostrils and the mouth it has a pair of naso-labial grooves which are involved in chemoreception and it has sixteen costal grooves {{on either side of the}} body. The legs are relatively long and the toes have expanded terminal pads with square cut ends. The tail is prehensile and is round in cross section and used when the salamander clambers around among the branches of trees. The back varies in colour from brown to light grey, mottled or marbled and speckled with bronze flecks. It sometimes has a greenish sheen. The juveniles have a bronze stripe down the spine.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —We {{investigated}} habitat use {{and movements}} of the <b>wandering</b> <b>salamander,</b> Aneides vagrans, in an old-growth forestcanopy. We conducted a mark-recapture study of salamanders in the crowns of five large redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) inPrairie Creek Redwoods State Park, California. This represented a first attempt to document the residency and behavior ofA. vagrans in a canopy environment. We placed litter bags on 65 fern (Polypodium scouleri) mats, covering 10 % of their totalsurface area in each tree. Also, we set cover boards on one fern mat in each of two trees. We checked cover objects 2 – 4 timesper month during fall and winter seasons. We marked 40 individuals with elastomer tags and recaptured 13. Only onerecaptured salamander moved (vertically 7 m) from its original point of capture. We compared habitats associated withsalamander captures using correlation analysis and stepwise regression. At the tree-level, {{the best predictor of}} salamanderabundance was water storage by fern mats. At the fern mat-level, the presence of cover boards accounted for 85 % of thevariability observed in captures. Population estimates indicated that individual trees had up to 29 salamanders. Large fernmats have high water-holding capacities, which likely enable year-round occupation of the canopy by A. vagrans. Otherobservations indicate that A. vagrans and its close relative A. ferreus also occupy additional habitats in forest canopies,especially moist cavities inside decaying wood...|$|E
