The NHL quickly announced three new teams: The San Jose Sharks, who began play in the 1991–92 season, and the Ottawa Senators and Tampa Bay Lightning, who followed a year later.|$|E
5|$|A Russian immigrant, Silverman {{arrived in}} the United States before she was a year old. Her family settled in Providence, Rhode Island, where she {{completed}} her schooling, married and had four children. While doing relief work during the First World War, she {{became aware of the}} depth of social problems and the effects of war on refugees. Joining the Zionist movement in the 1900s, <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> she became a motivational speaker, advocating {{for the establishment of a}} permanent Jewish home in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|He was {{succeeded by}} his brother, Ceolwulf; a post-Conquest legend claims {{that his son}} Cynehelm was murdered to gain the succession. Within two years Ceolwulf had been deposed, and the kingship passed {{permanently}} out of Coenwulf's family. Coenwulf was the last king of Mercia to exercise substantial dominance over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> of his death, the rise of Wessex had begun under King Egbert, and Mercia never recovered its former position of power.|$|E

5|$|In fact, {{following}} a break of eleven years, the Hungarians {{returned to the}} Carpathian Basin in 892. They came to assist Arnulf of East Francia against Svatopluk I of Moravia. Widukind of Corvey and Liutprand of Cremona condemned the Frankish monarch for destroying the defense lines built along the empire's borders, because this also enabled the Hungarians to attack East Francia <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade.</b>|$|E
5|$|The future {{eastern half}} of Highway 82 came first, as a rough path over Independence Pass that soon reached Aspen. A private company {{improved}} it into a toll road for stagecoaches, open year-round. The city's rapid growth fostered a race {{to make the first}} rail connection, which displaced the toll road as the primary route to Aspen <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade.</b> Later, the railroad's right-of-way would {{serve as the basis for}} the highway.|$|E
5|$|The pre-Islamic Middle East was {{dominated}} by the Byzantine and Sassanian empires. The Roman-Persian Wars between the two had devastated the region, making the empires unpopular amongst local tribes. Furthermore, in the lands that would be conquered by Muslims many Christians (Nestorians, Monophysites, Jacobites and Copts) were disaffected from the Eastern Orthodox Church which deemed them heretics. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> Muslims conquered Mesopotamia, Byzantine Syria, Byzantine Egypt, large parts of Persia, and established the Rashidun Caliphate.|$|E

IBM expects the price to decrease substantially <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> as the technology improves.|$|E
5|$|After construction, {{the station}} {{served as the}} PRR's sole Philadelphia stop for most long-distance east-west Main Line traffic to avoid a reverse move into Broad Street Station (and later 30th Street Station). It also served local trains from Fort Washington, Chestnut Hill, Bustleton, and Trenton, {{as well as a}} variety of {{services}} from the PRR-owned West Jersey and Seashore Railroad system. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> of completion, the station was already overcrowded. On June 22, 1912, the PRR signed a million-dollar contract for massive renovations to the station. Designed by PRR architect William H. Cookman, the modifications reflected the latest in passenger station design.|$|E
5|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century the metric system of weights and {{measures}} proved a convenient political compromise during the unification processes in the Netherlands, Germany and Italy. In 1814, Portugal became the first country {{not part of the}} French Empire to officially adopt a metric system. Spain found it expedient in 1858 to follow the French example and <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> Latin America had also adopted the metric system. There was considerable resistance to metrication in the United Kingdom and in the United States, though once the United Kingdom announced its metrication program in 1965, the Commonwealth followed suit.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{the school}} settled in England in 1794 and the Society of Jesus was officially re-established in Britain in 1803. Stonyhurst {{remained}} {{the headquarters of}} the English Province until the middle of the century; by 1851, a third of the Province's Jesuits were based there. Until the 1920s, Jesuit priests were trained on site in what is today the preparatory school. There was a drop in vocations after World War I and the seminary was closed. The number of Jesuits teaching at Stonyhurst fell to a third of the staff <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade.</b> Since then, the Jesuit presence has been in decline, but the school continues to place Catholicism and Jesuit philosophy at its core under the guidance of a Jesuit-led chaplaincy team and the involvement of the Jesuits in its governance.|$|E
5|$|Jacques Arcadelt (also Jacob Arcadelt; 14 October 1568) was a Franco-Flemish {{composer}} of the Renaissance, {{active in}} both Italy and France, and principally {{known as a}} composer of secular vocal music. Although he also wrote sacred vocal music, {{he was one of}} the most famous of the early composers of madrigals; his first book of madrigals, published <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> of the appearance of the earliest examples of the form, was the most widely printed collection of madrigals of the entire era. In addition to his work as a madrigalist, and distinguishing him from the other prominent early composers of madrigals – Philippe Verdelot and Costanzo Festa – he was equally prolific and adept at composing chansons, particularly late in his career when he lived in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki wrote The Diary of Lady Murasaki, {{a volume}} of poetry, and The Tale of Genji. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> of its completion, Genji was {{distributed}} throughout the provinces; within a century it was recognized as a classic of Japanese literature and had become a subject of scholarly criticism. Early in the 20th century her work was translated; a six-volume English translation was completed in 1933. Scholars continue to {{recognize the importance of}} her work, which reflects Heian court society at its peak. Since the 13th century her works have been illustrated by Japanese artists and well-known ukiyo-e woodblock masters.|$|E

5|$|The lack of {{good public}} housing, poor sanitation, and high {{unemployment}} led to social problems from crime to health issues. The proliferation of squatter settlements resulted in safety hazards and caused the Bukit Ho Swee Fire in 1961 that killed four people and left 16,000 others homeless. The Housing Development Board set up before independence {{continued to be}} largely successful and huge building projects sprung up to provide affordable public housing to resettle the squatters. <b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade,</b> {{the majority of the}} population had been housed in these apartments. The Central Provident Fund (CPF) Housing Scheme, introduced in 1968, allows residents to use their compulsory savings account to purchase HDB flats and gradually increases home ownership in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The {{revolution}} {{destroyed a}} colonial administration ruled {{from the other}} side of the world, and dismantled with it the raja, seen by many as obsolete and powerless. Also, it relaxed the rigid racial and social categorisations of colonial Indonesia. Tremendous energies and aspirations were created amongst Indonesians; a new creative surge was seen in writing and art, as was a great demand for education and modernisation. It did not, however, significantly improve the economic or political fortune of the population’s poverty-stricken peasant majority; only a few Indonesians were able to gain a larger role in commerce, and hopes for democracy were dashed <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Within</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade,</b> the {{collection}} had expanded to 7,000 traditional and modern objects from across all of Africa. Under Walker's tenure, the museum expanded its contemporary art collection, opening a permanent gallery in 1997. That year, photographer Constance Stuart Larrabee gave the museum 3,000 photographs from South Africa. In 2005, the museum received the Walt Disney-Tishman Collection of 525 works spanning most major African art styles and 75 cultures. The acquisition was a {{validation of the}} museum's status, given the other institutions who vied for {{the collection}}. The museum's library also grew upon joining the Smithsonian, from 3,000 to 30,000 volumes in visual arts, anthropology, cooking, history, religion, and travel, especially works published in Africa. It now contains 50,000 volumes.|$|E
