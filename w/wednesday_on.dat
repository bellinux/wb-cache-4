5|$|Further misfortune {{came when}} Kisnorbo {{suffered}} damaged knee ligaments in 3–1 defeat to Sheffield <b>Wednesday</b> <b>on</b> 26 April 2008, sidelining him for six months. His injury badly affected Leicester's hopes of surviving in the Championship. He played his 100th game and scored his last ever goal for Leicester in a 2–0 home win over Ipswich on 26 December 2007.|$|E
5|$|Carson {{made only}} four {{appearances}} in the 2005–06 season, all in cup competitions, and in March 2006, was allowed to move to Sheffield <b>Wednesday</b> <b>on</b> loan. Wednesday sought his services to help solve their goalkeeping crisis, while Carson was looking to gain more first team experience and to challenge for {{a place in the}} England 2006 FIFA World Cup squad. He kept five clean sheets in nine appearances for Wednesday, whose assistant manager Kevin Summerfield hailed his contribution as a key factor in helping the club escape relegation. He returned to Liverpool {{at the end of the}} season and in July 2006, extended his contract with Liverpool until 2011.|$|E

5|$|For the 2006–07 season, Danny Wilson was {{appointed}} the new manager, Wilson had previously managed Humphreys at Sheffield <b>Wednesday.</b> <b>On</b> 22 August 2006, Humphreys was dropped for Hartlepool's match against Hereford United. After making 230 consecutive appearances, {{this was the}} first time Humphreys had not played since October 2001. Shortly after that match, Humphreys joined Port Vale on a month's loan. This was the third time that Danny Wilson had loaned Humphreys out during his career, the only times Humphreys had ever been loaned out. Port Vale tried to extend Humphreys' loan deal by at least another month, but Hartlepool refused and Humphreys returned. Humphreys later stated that he had no intentions of leaving Hartlepool.|$|E
5|$|Given {{was one of}} {{the first}} signings of then-newly {{appointed}} manager Dalglish. Given made his debut in Newcastle's 2–1 home victory over Sheffield <b>Wednesday</b> <b>on</b> 9 August 1997 and immediately established himself in the first team, beating fellow goalkeepers Pavel Srníček, Shaka Hislop and Steve Harper to the position. Newcastle advanced to the final of the FA Cup, and Given played the whole match as the team were defeated 2–0 by league champions Arsenal. The club also progressed to the final the following year, but Given was replaced by Steve Harper as Newcastle lost 2–0 in the final, this time to Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|Hooper {{made his}} first {{appearance}} for Sheffield <b>Wednesday</b> <b>on</b> 31 October 2015, coming on as a late substitute in a 1–0 win at home against Nottingham Forest in the Championship. In his seventh appearance in all competitions for the club, Hooper scored his first goal for Sheffield Wednesday in a 2–1 defeat at away against MK Dons. In Hooper's final two matches for Sheffield Wednesday before his loan expired, he managed to score four goals which contributed hugely in Wednesday's victories against Bolton Wanderers and Leeds United.|$|E

5|$|The club's {{attempt to}} defend the victory {{came to an end}} after six {{consecutive}} clean sheets, when they were defeated 3–2 by Barnsley with Speirs scoring one of the goals. However, he was limited to ten league games, not playing from September until March, and finished the season with seven goals. They included his second senior hat-trick during a 5–1 victory over Sheffield <b>Wednesday</b> <b>on</b> 30 March 1912. Speirs started the following season, but after playing 13 of the first 15games, he left. He had played 96games in total, scoring 33goals.|$|E
5|$|Bonass {{came into}} the team at outside-right for the fifth game of the new season, before {{reverting}} to outside-left against Sheffield <b>Wednesday</b> <b>on</b> 17 September, which coincided with Chesterfield's first win. Two weeks later, he scored the only goal of the game at home to West Ham United direct from a corner kick. He kept his place {{to the end of}} the year, but then played only three times before the end of February when he submitted a transfer request. The Derbyshire Times reported no disharmony between club and player, who just felt that different surroundings might help a return to form. He moved on to London club Queens Park Rangers (QPR) in June, and played in all three of their matches before the 1939–40 Football League season was abandoned when war broke out.|$|E

5|$|Boyd scored {{his sixth}} {{goal of the}} 2010–11 {{campaign}} in Peterborough's 5–4 win against Swindon Town in October 2010. Two weeks later, Boyd was sent-off for violent conduct in a 3–0 home loss to league leaders Brighton & Hove Albion, {{only the second time}} he had been red carded in his career. He returned to first-team action on 16 November 2010, playing in the club's 4–1 FA Cup win over Stockport County. Boyd had to wait four months for his next goal, scoring twice against Sheffield <b>Wednesday</b> <b>on</b> 1 February 2011. He went on to score five goals in five matches throughout February and March, scoring once against Colchester United. This goal was followed by braces against Exeter City and Carlisle United respectively, although Boyd missed the chance to complete his hat-trick in the latter match when he missed a 90th-minute penalty. Three days later, on 15 March 2011, Boyd scored twice against Sheffield Wednesday in a 4–1 victory at Hillsborough. He made it eight goals in eight matches when he scored in Peterborough's 2–2 away draw at Bristol Rovers. He took his goal tally to 17 for the season when he scored Peterborough's third goal in a 5–0 home win against Dagenham & Redbridge on 7 May 2011. Boyd played in all three of Peterborough's play-off fixtures, playing the whole match in the 2011 League One play-off Final at Old Trafford as Peterborough beat Huddersfield Town 3–0 to earn promotion back to the Championship. During the club's successful 2010–11 campaign, Boyd scored 17 goals in 51 appearances.|$|E
5|$|Crewe manager Dario Gradi {{decided not}} to offer a {{contract}} to Symes, who instead spent a period on trial at Bradford City, which included an 8–1 pre-season friendly win over Farsley Celtic. He signed for the League One side in July 2004 with fellow former Everton trainee Steven Schumacher, with whom he lived during his spell at Bradford. Symes made his Bradford debut in a 2–1 defeat at Hartlepool United on {{the opening day of}} the 2004–05 season. Three days later he missed a late penalty which would have secured Bradford victory over Peterborough United in a game in which Symes was also booked. Symes was dropped from the first team after Bradford signed Dele Adebola. When Bradford were allowed special dispensation to sign Neil Roberts, Bradford tried to give Symes a loan transfer to Darlington but the deal was blocked by the Football League. The following month, Symes scored his first goals for Bradford when he came off the bench at half-time to score twice in a 3–1 victory over Sheffield <b>Wednesday</b> <b>on</b> 23 October 2004. They were the only goals he scored that season from just 15 games.|$|E

25|$|Along with Cyclone Tracy, Ash Wednesday {{is arguably}} the natural {{disaster}} {{to have had the}} greatest impact on the Australian national psyche. For the next quarter century, it was used as the measure for all bushfire emergencies in Australia, most notably the 2003 Canberra bushfires, which experienced very similar severe fire weather. The disaster caused 75 deaths, which is the second highest death toll for a bushfire in Australia. The 2009 Black Saturday bushfire disaster has since surpassed Ash <b>Wednesday</b> <b>on</b> the list of disasters in Australia by death toll, with 173 confirmed fatalities as of 30 March 2009—although the 1983 fires still remain the worst in Australian history in terms of property loss.|$|E

25|$|Southampton's {{third round}} draw saw the club host Championship side Sheffield <b>Wednesday</b> <b>on</b> 25 September. After {{half an hour}} of {{pressure}} from both sides, Jay Rodriguez scored his first goal for the Saints with a shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area to put the hosts ahead. Following a number of additional chances for Southampton to go two up, the sides went into half time at 1–0. Despite a number of clear cut chances in the second half, it took until the 78th minute for Rodriguez to double Southampton's lead when he converted a penalty following a foul on winger Steve De Ridder. Wednesday increased the pressure in the final part of the match, but were unable to reverse Southampton's win.|$|E
25|$|Wednesday 16 February— Ash <b>Wednesday</b> <b>on</b> the Christian calendar—dawned {{as another}} unrelentingly hot, dry day. The weather early on Ash Wednesday was complex {{and did not}} signify how the day would develop. A front {{separated}} hot, dry air {{coming in from the}} interior to the north, from cooler air moving eastwards from the Southern Ocean. Ahead of the front were hot, turbulent, gale force northerly winds. Temperatures around Melbourne and Adelaide quickly rose above 43°C, with winds gusting up to 100km/h and relative humidity plunging to as low as 6 per cent. From mid-morning, McArthur's fire danger index was in excess of 100 in several places in Victoria and South Australia. It {{would be one of the}} worst fire weather days in south-east Australia since the disastrous Black Friday bushfires in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Chelsea {{had begun}} the season much as they had {{finished}} the last, with four consecutive defeats, including a thrilling 5–6 loss to Manchester United, which left them 12th in November. From there the team went on a remarkable run, losing just 3 of the next 25 games and secured the title with a game to spare after a 3–0 win against Sheffield <b>Wednesday</b> <b>on</b> St George's Day. Key to the success were two league wins against principal rivals and eventual runners-up Wolverhampton Wanderers. The first was a dramatic 4–3 win at Molineux – {{a game in which}} Chelsea were trailing 2–3 going into stoppage time – and a 1–0 win at Stamford Bridge in April, secured with a Sillett penalty awarded after Wolves captain Billy Wright had punched a goal-bound shot over the bar.|$|E
