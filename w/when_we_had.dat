Eric Bloom stated that [...] "in general, CBS was straight with us, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> fans working inside the company", but after [...] "3-4 different Presidents of the company came and went" [...] the commercial appeal of Blue Öyster Cult had disappeared for the new management.|$|E
500|$|To {{make sure}} the visual effects were made in just one year and without {{exceeding}} the budget, special effects supervisor John Bruno shipped the 900 effects shots to eleven companies in four countries – United States, New Zealand, United Kingdom and Canada – and did extensive previsualization.

[...] For instance, complex wirework rigs were employed [...] which enabled the actors to do some stunts without resorting to digital doubles, including a computer controlled flying rig from Cirque Du Soleil for Angel's flight, and one for Halle Berry's flying spins.|$|E

God said, Let us make man in our own image and likeness. If he is in the likeness of God, and rules the whole earth, and has been granted authority over everything on earth from God, who is his buyer, tell me? Who is his seller? To God alone belongs this power; or, rather, not even to God himself. For his gracious gifts, it says, are irrevocable. (...) God would not therefore reduce the human race to slavery, since he himself, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been enslaved to sin, spontaneously recalled us to freedom.

500|$|He scored {{twice in}} 30 Conference games {{in his first}} season with Dover, and his {{performance}} earned him international selection, chosen for England's National Game XI {{for the first time in}} March 1999. He maintained the standard the following season; Dover's best player against rivals Rushden & Diamonds, he was eventually stretchered off with a damaged Achilles tendon after three opponents were booked for fouling him. Sidelined for a month due to injuries sustained in that match, Wormull returned to play 20 minutes as a substitute before joining Rushden for a fee of £50,000 later that same week. BBC Sport's 2000–01 Football Conference preview said that Dover would miss him, a view later echoed by then assistant manager Clive Walker, who described the 1999–2000 season as [...] "a year <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> players like Simon Wormull, Joe Dunne and Dave Clarke in the team. In all honesty, we weren't far away from having a side good enough to win the division.

During the 1990s both Harrison and McCartney were so convinced of the Maharishi's innocence that they offered their apologies. Harrison gave a benefit concert for the Maharishi-associated Natural Law Party in 1992, and later apologised for the way the Maharishi had been treated by saying, [...] "We were very young" [...] and [...] "It's probably {{in the history books}} that Maharishi 'tried to attack Mia Farrow' – but it's bullshit, total bullshit." [...] Cynthia Lennon wrote in 2006 that she [...] "hated leaving on a note of discord and mistrust, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> enjoyed so much kindness from the Maharishi". Asked if he forgave the Beatles, the Maharishi replied, [...] "I could never be upset with angels." [...] McCartney took his daughter, Stella, to visit the Maharishi in the Netherlands in 2007, which renewed their friendship.|$|E
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was at a time <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E

David Thomson and directors Stanley Donen and Howard Hawks concurred that Grant was the greatest and most important actor {{in the history of the}} cinema. He was a favorite of Hitchcock, who admired him and called him [...] "the only actor I ever loved in my whole life", and remained one of Hollywood's top box-office attractions for almost 30 years. Wansell wrote: [...] "To millions of movie-goers around the world, Cary Grant will forever epitomize the glamour, and the style, of Hollywood in its golden years. With his dark hair, and even darker eyes, mischievous smile and effortless elegance, he was, is, and always will be indelibly one of the great movie stars. Since his death in 1986, the incandescence of his screen image has not dimmed for a single moment".

500|$|One of {{the first}} to come on board the project was Compay Segundo (born Máximo Francisco Repilado Muñoz) (1907–2003), who at 89 years old was the oldest of the performers. During a {{discussion}} about politics, the veteran Segundo said: [...] "Politics? This new guy [...] is good. The 1930s were rough. That's <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the really bad times." [...] Segundo was an accomplished guitarist and tres player who started his career playing with established bands of the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1940s, he gained fame as one half of the Los Compadres duo, and then formed Los Muchachos, a band that he led until his death in 2003. For the Buena Vista Social Club recording and performances, Segundo played a unique seven-stringed instrument, a hybrid between a guitar and a tres, which he devised himself and called an armónico. He also sang, mostly doing background vocals, in a number of songs in his baritone voice, including the self-penned opening track, Chan Chan, with Eliades Ochoa as the leading voice. Cowboy hat wearing Eliades Ochoa (b. 1946), who had collaborated previously with Segundo and was a well established traditional Cuban folk performer, played guitar and sang for the group. Omara Portuondo (b. 1930), a bolero singer and the only female in the collective, sang [...] "Veinte Años" [...] on the record and duets with Segundo and Ibrahim Ferrer during live performances.|$|E
