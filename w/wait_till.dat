5|$|They {{returned}} to Botany Bay {{on the evening}} of 23 January, when Phillip gave orders to move the fleet to Sydney Cove the next morning, 24 January. That day, there was a huge gale blowing, making it impossible to leave Botany Bay, so they decided to <b>wait</b> <b>till</b> the next day, 25 January. However, during 24 January, they spotted the ships Astrolabe and Boussole, flying the French flag, at the entrance to Botany Bay; they were having as much trouble getting into the bay as the First Fleet was having getting out.|$|E
5|$|Females {{are ready}} to breed at ten to eleven months of age {{although}} males sometimes <b>wait</b> <b>till</b> the following year. Barn owls are usually monogamous, sticking to one partner for life unless one of the pair dies. During the non-breeding season they may roost separately, but as the breeding season approaches they return to their established nesting site, showing considerable site fidelity. In colder climates, in harsh weather and where winter food supplies may be scarce, they may roost in farm buildings and in barns between hay bales, but they then run the risk that their selected nesting hole may {{be taken over by}} some other, earlier-nesting species. Single males may establish feeding territories, patrolling the hunting areas, occasionally stopping to hover, and perching on lofty eminences where they screech to attract a mate. Where a female has lost her mate but maintained her breeding site, she usually seems to manage to attract a new spouse.|$|E
5|$|The Devi Bhagavata Purana narrates {{that when}} Kali (Satyavati) was {{ferrying}} the rishi (sage) Parashara {{across the river}} Yamuna, the sage wanted Kali to satisfy his lust and held her right hand. She tried to dissuade Parashara, saying that a learned Brahmin of his stature should not desire a woman who stinks of fish. She finally gave in, realizing the desperation and persistence of the sage and fearing {{that if she did}} not heed to his request, he might topple the boat midstream. Kali agreed, and told Parashara to be patient until the boat reached the bank. On reaching the other side the sage grabbed her again, but she declared that her body stank and coitus should be delightful to them both. At these words, Matsyagandha was transformed (by the powers of the sage) into Yojanagandha ("she whose fragrance can be smelled from across a yojana"). She now smelled of musk, and so was called Kasturi-gandhi ("musk-fragrant"). When Parashara, tormented with desire, approached her again she insisted that the act was not appropriate in broad daylight, as her father and others would see them in sex from the other bank; they should <b>wait</b> <b>till</b> night. The sage, with his powers, shrouded the entire area in fog. Before Parashara could enjoy her, Satyavati again interrupted him to say that he would enjoy her and depart, robbing her of her virginity and leaving her shamed in society. The sage then blessed her with virgo intacta. She asked Parashara to promise her that the coitus would be a secret and her virginity intact; the son born from their union would be as famous as the great sage; and her fragrance and youth would be eternal. Parashara granted her these wishes and was satiated by the beautiful Satyavati. After the act, the sage bathed in the river and left, never to meet her again. The Mahabharata abridges the story, noting only two wishes for Satyavati: her virgo intacta and everlasting sweet fragrance.|$|E

25|$|Lyn {{also won}} the cup in 1945 and 1946 but had to <b>wait</b> <b>till</b> 1964 for their first league-title. With Harald Berg and Ola Dybwad-Olsen as main {{contributors}} the club secured another victory in the cup in 1967, and in 1968 the club won The Double, clinching both the League title and the Cup, {{and became the first}} Norwegian team to reach the quarter final of the European Cup Winners' Cup, where they met Barcelona. Because of the weather conditions during the winter in Norway, both matches were played in Spain. Lyn lost the first game 2-3 and in the second match Lyn was leading 2-0 with 15 minutes left to play. The match ended 2-2 and thus Lyn was eliminated.|$|E
25|$|An athlete {{may choose}} to leave their sport due to many reasons, either due to an injury or due to them {{reaching}} an old age. If an athlete becomes injured, this must be looked deeper into, as an injury can vary between very subtle and very dangerous. If the athlete loves their sport, they will sometimes hide {{the severity of the}} injury and just <b>wait</b> <b>till</b> it heals slightly {{in order for them to}} get playing as soon as possible, which could cause catastrophic injuries later on in their career. This is why injuries need to be looked into, because if the injury is too extreme where the athlete can't physically go back to playing their sport, they may get forced to retire in order for them not to damage themselves at a more extreme level, resulting in the athlete experiencing many different feelings, such as alienation, distress or uselessness.|$|E

25|$|Temporal {{resolution}} of fMRI is limited by: (1) the feedback mechanism {{that raises the}} blood flow operating slowly; (2) having to <b>wait</b> <b>till</b> net magnetization recovers before sampling a slice again; and (3) having to acquire multiple slices to cover the whole brain or region of interest. Advanced techniques to improve temporal resolution address these issues. Using multiple coils speeds up acquisition time in exact proportion to the coils used. Another technique is to decide which parts of the signal matter less and drop those. This could be either those sections of the image that repeat often in a spatial map (that is small clusters dotting the image periodically) or those sections repeating infrequently (larger clusters). The first, a high-pass filter in k-space, has been proposed by Gary H. Glover and colleagues at Stanford. These mechanisms assume the researcher has {{an idea of the}} expected shape of the activation image.|$|E
25|$|Next, Surrey {{moved to}} block off the Scots' route north and so James {{was forced to}} move his army and {{artillery}} two miles to Branxton Hill. The Scottish artillery, as described by an English source, included five great curtals, two great culverins, four sakers, and six great serpentines. The King's secretary, Patrick Paniter {{was in charge of}} these cannon. When the armies were within three miles of each other Surrey sent the Rouge Croix pursuivant to James, who answered that he would <b>wait</b> <b>till</b> noon. At 11 o'clock, Thomas, Lord Howard's vanguard and artillery crossed the Twizel Bridge. (Pitscottie says the King would not allow the Scots artillery to fire on the vulnerable English during this manoeuvre.) The Scots army was in good order in five formations, after the Almain (German) manner. On Friday afternoon the Scots host descended without speaking any word to meet the English.|$|E
25|$|Syed Qutb from a {{young age}} would save up his money for a man called Amsaalih, who used to sell books around the local villages. He would have a big {{collection}} of books, and another small collection specifically for Syed Qutb. If Syed never had the money, he would tell him that I don't have the money now, so let me borrow it and I'll give it you next time you come around. And Amsaalih would let him do that. At the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, and then give lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would <b>wait</b> <b>till</b> Syed Qutb came back from school, and ask him to share the knowledge he had to them. In many occasions he would be shy because he was a young man, but in some occasions he would go and teach the knowledge he had to the people who asked him.|$|E

500|$|If {{the regular}} army showed {{contempt}} for the masses belonging to the SA, many stormtroopers returned the feeling, seeing the army as insufficiently committed to the National Socialist revolution. Max Heydebreck, an SA leader in Rummelsburg, denounced the army to his fellow brownshirts, telling them, [...] "Some of the officers of the army are swine. Most officers are too old {{and have to be}} replaced by young ones. We want to <b>wait</b> <b>till</b> Papa Hindenburg is dead, and then the SA will march against the army." ...|$|E
500|$|Lowell had {{intended}} never to remarry {{after the death}} of his wife Maria White. However, in 1857, surprising his friends, he became engaged to Frances Dunlap, who many described as simple and unattractive. Dunlap, niece of the former governor of Maine Robert P. Dunlap, was a friend of Lowell's first wife and formerly wealthy, though she and her family had fallen into reduced circumstances. Lowell and Dunlap married on September 16, 1857, in a ceremony performed by his brother. Lowell wrote, [...] "My second marriage was the wisest act of my life, & as long as I am sure of it, I can afford to <b>wait</b> <b>till</b> my friends agree with me." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{official}} trailer for X-Men: Days of Future Past {{was released in}} October 2013. Jason Callina of Herald News gave the trailer a positive response, saying, [...] "it is fantastic to see characters that I grew up with in the flesh...we still have to <b>wait</b> <b>till</b> the end of May to see if Fox succeeded, but for now they have my interest". Ben Child of The Guardian criticized the trailer {{for the amount of}} characters that will appear in the film. Child wrote, [...] "overloading the movie with superheroes might please fans of the comic books, but the rest of us will be chewing on our own spleens when the umpteenth brightly coloured dude turns up to spout one line of dialogue, then drop off the map".|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to questions posed by The Guardian and handed to the band via their lawyer, Pussy Riot accused Putin and the Russian Orthodox Church of orchestrating the case. Samutsevich said in December 2012 that [...] "more than anything, what many people didn't see during the trial were those moments when our 'right to defence' was violated. It's not that we were helpless, it was a situation of despair." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she continued: [...] "The trial was built {{in such a way}} that we couldn't defend ourselves. They didn't listen to us. We could have sat downstairs, where you <b>wait</b> <b>till</b> you're taken to the courtroom, and not go in at all and everything would've gone the same way. The fact that we took part physically [...] didn't actually change anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Gaga {{collaborated with}} Nadir [...] "RedOne" [...] Khayat in writing [...] "Bad Romance", with Khayat {{taking charge of}} production. The song was {{recorded}} at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles and FC Walvisch Recording Media Studios in Amsterdam. [...] "Bad Romance" [...] was released as the lead single from The Fame Monster (2009), Gaga's follow-up to her debut album, The Fame (2008). Before its official release, a demo version of the song was published illegally on the internet, prompting Gaga to comment via Twitter, [...] "leaked next single is makin my ears bleed. <b>Wait</b> <b>till</b> you hear the real version." [...] A snippet of the song was performed on Saturday Night Live on October 3, 2009, along with [...] "Poker Face" [...] and [...] "LoveGame". The final version of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] premiered during the finale of fashion designer Alexander McQueen's 2010 Paris Fashion Week show, and the song's release followed on October 19, 2009.|$|E
500|$|Apaza from Direct Lyrics called [...] "More than Friends" [...] a [...] "European smash", but {{questioned}} {{its release}} process, [...] "It's January, it's cold, so why didn't Inna <b>wait</b> <b>till</b> like July to unleash 'More Than Friends'?". Julien Goncalves of Pure Charts noted the song's commercial appeal. The Times of India Gavin Rasquinha wrote, [...] "If you like house music with catchy beats and strong vocals, give {{this one a}} whirl." [...] Commercially, [...] "More than Friends" [...] reached number 20 in native Romania, number 52 in Italy and number 92 in France. The record spent 25 weeks on Spain's PROMUSICAE chart, debuting at number 30 in April 2013 and peaking at position seven in August 2013. It was also certified Gold by the same organisation for streaming four million copies as of November 2013. [...] "More than Friends" [...] further reached the top ten in Slovakia and the Polish dance chart, and was also awarded Platinum in Venezuela for over 10,000 units sold.|$|E

500|$|Besides <b>Wait</b> <b>Till</b> Your Father Gets Home (1972–1974) and Hong Kong Phooey (1974), Nichola Dobson {{wrote in}} The A to Z of Animation and Cartoons that Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch! {{was one of}} Hanna-Barbera's more {{successful}} shows. However, in The Encyclopedia of Guilty Pleasures: 1001 Things You Hate to Love, three different authors labeled the series as one of Hanna-Barbera's [...] "lesser-known efforts" [...] but ultimately called it a [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] and enjoyed that it had its own score. In a retrospective view of older cartoons, the staff at MeTV included the show on their list of [...] "15 Forgotten Cartoons from the Early 1970s You Used to Love". Deirdre Sheppard from Common Sense Media rated it three out of five stars and noted that it has [...] "no educational content"; however, she also said that [...] "other than the mildest of mild violence, and the characters' tendency to poke fun at each other, the series is fun and inoffensive".|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Khan and his brother-in-law, Vedant Malik, {{opposed the}} Maharashtra state government's new law raising the {{drinking}} age to 25 by filing a public-interest litigation (PIL) against it. In an interview given to The Times of India he said; [...] "It's completely unfair {{to expect that}} one has to <b>wait</b> <b>till</b> 25 years to exercise his freedom of choice regarding one's lifestyle. Young India is not as irresponsible as the older establishment assumes it to be." [...] He walked the ramp to support Shabana Azmi's charitable initiative, Mijwan Welfare Society, an NGO dedicated to empowering girls. He said that he feels privileged to have been brought up in a family surrounded by strong women. In 2013, Khan along with his wife Avantika Malik and mother Nuzhat Khan, purchased a four-acre land which will be converted into an animal shelter with veterinary doctors and staff who will attend to the rescued animals until they are adopted.|$|E

He would develop a brief habit of wearing three [...] neckties at a time, which he understands {{to have been a}} manifestation of his personal insecurity. He also points to a particular image from his childhood that shaped his understanding of the world—" [...] was a dream world, those droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees. Middle America as it was supposed to be. But then on the cherry tree would be this pitch oozing out, some of it black, some of it yellow, and there were millions and millions of red ants racing all over the sticky pitch, all over the tree. So you see, there's this beautiful world and you just look a little bit closer and it's all red ants".|$|E
