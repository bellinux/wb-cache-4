5|$|Although {{the ideal}} ages for {{marriage}} were thirty {{for a man}} and twenty for a woman, it was common for a male to marry at age sixteen and a female at age fourteen. To encourage families to marry off their daughters, a law was introduced in 189 BCE that increased the poll tax rate fivefold for unmarried <b>women</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>ages</b> of fifteen and thirty. People of the Han practiced a strict form of exogamy where one could not marry {{a person who had}} the same surname, even if both partners could not be traced back to a common ancestor (however, this excluded the royal family, who sometimes married distant relatives for political reasons). Officials often married into families with officials of equal status and sometimes married royal princesses or had their daughters marry kings and even the emperor.|$|E
