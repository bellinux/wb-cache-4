They have three specialized organs that are unique to Chondrichthyes; the epigonal organs (lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone) that surround the gonads, the Leydig's organ <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> their esophagus, and a spiral valve in their intestine. These organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). They also possess an identifiable thymus and a well-developed spleen (their most important immune organ) where various lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored.|$|E
5|$|During a {{party for}} the orphanage's opening, Laura and Simón argue, and Simón hides from her. While looking for him, she {{encounters}} a child wearing a sack mask who shoves her into a bathroom and locks her inside. When Laura escapes, she realizes that Simón is missing and is unable to find him. That night Laura hears several loud crashes <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the orphanage. Police psychologist Pilar (Mabel Rivera) suggests to Laura and Carlos that Benigna may have abducted Simón.|$|E
5|$|According to chapter 9 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{the three}} {{brothers}} Vili, Vé, and Odin, are {{the creators of}} the first man and woman. The brothers were once walking along a beach and found two trees there. They took the wood and from it created the first human beings; Ask and Embla. One of the three gave them the breath of life, the second gave them movement and intelligence, and the third gave them shape, speech, hearing and sight. Further, the three gods gave them clothing and names.

5|$|After {{giving the}} {{impression}} that he wished to negotiate, Ivan Alexander, reinforced by Mongol cavalry, overwhelmed the smaller but better organized Byzantine army in the Battle of Rusokastro. The contested cities surrendered to Ivan Alexander, while Andronikos III sought refuge <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> Rusokastro. The war ended with Ivan Alexander meeting Andronikos and agreeing a peace based on the status quo. To seal the alliance, he betrothed his eldest son, Michael Asen IV, to Andronikos's daughter Maria (Eirene), the marriage eventually taking place in 1339. The Bulgarian emperor was now free to turn his attentions to Belaur, {{but it was not until}} 1336 or 1337 that the rebellion in the northwest was put down.|$|E
5|$|Al-Mu'tadid {{died at the}} Hasani palace on 5 April 902, at the age {{of either}} 40 or 47. There were rumours that he had been poisoned, but {{it is more likely that}} the rigours of his campaigns, coupled with his dissolute life, {{severely}} weakened his health. During his final illness, he refused to follow the advice of his physicians, and even kicked one of them to death. He left behind him four sons and several daughters. Al-Mu'tadid was the first Abbasid caliph to be buried <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> Baghdad. Like his sons after him, he was buried in the former Tahirid palace in the western part of the city, which was now used by the caliphs as a secondary residence.|$|E
5|$|In 431 BC, while peace {{already was}} precarious, ArchidamusII, Sparta's king, sent a new {{delegation}} to Athens, {{demanding that the}} Athenians submit to Sparta's demands. This deputation {{was not allowed to}} enter Athens, as Pericles had already passed a resolution according to which no Spartan deputation would be welcomed if the Spartans had previously initiated any hostile military actions. The Spartan army was at this time gathered at Corinth, and, citing this as a hostile action, the Athenians refused to admit their emissaries. With his last attempt at negotiation thus declined, Archidamus invaded Attica, but found no Athenians there; Pericles, aware that Sparta's strategy would be to invade and ravage Athenian territory, had previously arranged to evacuate the entire population of the region to <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> Athens.|$|E

5|$|Launceston Castle {{is located}} in the town of Launceston, Cornwall, England. It was {{probably}} built by Robert the Count of Mortain after 1068, and initially comprised an earthwork and timber castle with a large motte in one corner. Launceston Castle formed the administrative centre of the new earldom of Cornwall, with a large community packed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> its bailey. It was rebuilt in stone in the 12th century and then substantially redeveloped by Richard of Cornwall after 1227, including a high tower to enable visitors to view his surrounding lands. When Richard's son, Edmund, inherited the castle, he moved the earldom's administration to Lostwithiel, triggering the castle's decline. By 1337, the castle was increasingly ruinous and used primarily as a gaol and to host judicial assizes.|$|E

Coincidentally, her husband, Shankar, is in Saudi Arabia, his new workplace. Meera finds it tough without her husband but they manage to stay in touch. Shankar regularly sends his wages home to support his family that includes his father, Randhir Singh (Girish Karnad), mother, Gowri Singh (Prateeksha Lonkar), his paternal grandmother (Uttara Baokar) and Meera. One day, Meera does not find the remittance from Shankar. Time passes and when there are neither any further remittances nor any correspondence from her husband, Meera gets worried. When frantic inquiries are made, she is devastated to know that Shankar {{was killed in a}} freak accident that was allegedly caused by his Muslim roommate.|$|E

To Stauffenberg's dismay, he discovers {{only after the}} timer has been activated that, due to the warm weather, the conference {{is being held in}} an open-window summer barrack, whereas the plotters had intended to detonate the bomb <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the bunker for maximum damage. While his adjutant waits with the car, Stauffenberg places the briefcase with the bomb armed at the meeting as close to Hitler as possible. Stauffenberg then leaves the barrack, returning to the car. However, one of the officers at the meeting moves the bomb behind a table leg, which will inadvertently protect Hitler from most of the blast. When the bomb explodes, Stauffenberg is certain that Hitler is dead and flees Wolf's Lair. Before shutting down communications, Fellgiebel calls Mertz about the explosion but cannot clearly convey whether or not Hitler is dead.|$|E

5|$|Only the {{children}} of the king could be born inside the Inner Court. Every detail of the birth of the royal child was recorded, including the time of birth, which was to be used later by court astrologers to cast his or her horoscope. Ceremonies concerning the birth and the rites of passage of the child was performed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the Inner Court. The birth of a royal child was first announced by a succession of women who proclaimed the news along the Inner Court's streets. There were two waiting orchestras, one on the inside made of women and one on the outside of men, who would then carry out the official proclamation with conch shell fanfares. If the child was a prince the Gong of Victory was to be struck three times. The children would live with their respective mothers and be educated in special schools within the court.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Counselor {{transmitted}} {{and received}} imperial edicts {{to and from}} the chancellery and also presented officials' memorials to the throne. During Western Han, the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk's office was located <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the palace. He had the authority to investigate attendants and eunuchs of the palace and to reject improperly written memorials before submission to the Imperial Counselor. The Masters of Writing under the Minister Steward then processed these memorials before they were sent to the throne. The Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk's proximity to the emperor during Eastern Han allowed him to surpass the authority of his nominal superior, the Excellency of Works, yet his Western-Han-era power to inspect local provincial authorities was removed. The Minister Steward—who was supervised by the Imperial Counselor (and later Excellency of Works)—became the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk's new superior by early Eastern Han. The Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk also managed the Imperial Library in both Western and Eastern Han, this duty being transferred to a subordinate of the Minister of Ceremonies in 159 AD.|$|E
5|$|Zino's petrel {{has a very}} {{restricted}} {{range on}} the mountaintops of a single island, and is the most endangered European seabird. The birds, already confined to a limited area when discovered, {{were thought to be}} extinct by the mid-twentieth century. Two freshly fledged juveniles were found <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> the governor's palace in Funchal in the early 1940s, presumably attracted there by lights, but the species was not seen again until 1969. In 1969, Paul Zino played a tape of Fea's petrel from Bugio to a shepherd from Curral das Freiras; he immediately recognised the call, and led the researchers to the remaining nesting area. Predation by introduced rats meant that breeding success in the small population was low, and no young at all fledged in 1985. The Freira Conservation Project was founded in 1986 with the aim of increasing the population of Zino's petrel by controlling rats and human interference; the control was extended to cats after the mass predation of 1990.|$|E
