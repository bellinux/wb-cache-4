50|$|The {{catheter}} is held {{in place}} by an adhesive dressing, suture, or staple which is covered by an occlusive <b>dressing.</b> Regular <b>flushing</b> with saline or a heparin-containing solution keeps the line open and prevents blood clots. There is no evidence that heparin is better than saline at preventing blood clots. Certain lines are impregnated with antibiotics, silver-containing substances (specifically silver sulfadiazine) and/or chlorhexidine to reduce infection risk.|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to {{being one of the}} highest strength non-heat treatable aluminium alloys, magnesium-alloyed wrought aluminium 5083 displays excellent corrosion resistance and good weldability. Aluminium alloy 6061, alloyed with magnesium and silicon, displays high strength, excellent formability, adequate weldability and good corrosion resistance. These aluminium alloys find application in the ship building and transport industries where 5083 is often joined to 6061 to produce welded structures such as complex I-beams and semi-hollow or hollow channels. This project aimed at characterizing the hardness, tensile properties, corrosion behaviour and fatigue properties (in air and in a 3. 5 % NaCl solution) of aluminium 5083 and 6061 in the as-received and welded conditions. Plates of 5083 -H 111 and 6061 -T 651 aluminium, prepared with double-V or square butt joint preparations, were joined using semi-automatic or fully automatic pulsed gas metal arc welding (GMAW). The pulsed GMAW process allows close control over the welding arc and facilitates the use of lower average heat inputs, thereby improving the bead appearance and mechanical properties. During this investigation, three filler wires were evaluated, namely magnesium-alloyed ER 5183 and ER 5356 aluminium, and silicon-alloyed ER 4043. Hardness measurements revealed a decrease in hardness in the weld metal of the 5083 -H 111 <b>welds.</b> <b>Dressed</b> <b>welds</b> failed in the weld metal during transverse tensile testing, whereas undressed (as-welded) specimens failed at the weld toe or weld root due to the stress concentration introduced by the weld geometry. Significant softening, attributed to the partial dissolution and coarsening of strengthening precipitates and recrystallization during welding, was observed in the heat-affected zones of the 6061 -T 651 welds. During tensile testing, failure occurred in the heat-affected zone of all 6061 welds. Welding reduced the room temperature fatigue life of all specimens tested. In the 5083 welds, fatigue cracks initiated preferentially at gas pores, lack-of-fusion type defects and second phase particles in <b>dressed</b> <b>welds,</b> and at the stress concentration presented by the weld toes or the weld root in undressed welds. In 6061 welds, failure occurred preferentially in the softened heat-affected zone of the welds. As a result of improved control over the weld profile and a lower incidence of weld defects, fully automatic welds consistently outperformed semi-automatic welds during fatigue testing. The presence of a corrosive environment (a 3. 5 % NaCl solution in this investigation) during fatigue testing reduced the fatigue properties of all the samples tested. Corrosion pits formed preferentially at second phase particles or weld defects, and reduced the overall fatigue life by accelerating fatigue crack initiation.

60|$|They strolled on, and George felt mildly {{curious about}} them. The girl was pretty and graceful, with a stamp of {{refinement}} upon her; {{the man was}} essentially rugged and rather grim. Suddenly, however, a whistle blast rang out, and George hurried toward the engine. It was beginning to move when he reached it but, grasping a hand-rail, he clambered up. The cab was already full of passengers, but {{he had found a}} place on the frame above the wheels when he saw the girl in the light <b>dress</b> running, <b>flushed</b> and eager, along the line. Leaning down as far as possible, {{he held out his hand}} to her.|$|R
60|$|Hugh had her in {{his arms}} directly. It might be that Mr Tappertit's heart was really {{softened}} by her distress, or it might be that he felt it in some degree indecorous that his intended bride should be struggling in the grasp of another man. He commanded him, on second thoughts, to put her down again, and looked moodily on as she flew to Miss Haredale's side, and clinging to her <b>dress,</b> hid her <b>flushed</b> face in its folds.|$|R
60|$|Prissy {{took him}} quick, {{but she had}} barely {{time to get back}} to the kitchen before Emmeline marched in--mad as a wet hen because {{somebody}} had been ahead of her offering to sit up with Jane Lawson, and so she lost the chance of poking and prying into things while Jane was asleep. The minute she clapped eyes on Prissy she suspected something. It wasn't any wonder, for there was Prissy, all <b>dressed</b> up, with <b>flushed</b> cheeks and shining eyes. She was all in a quiver of excitement, and looked ten years younger.|$|R
60|$|Immediately {{above the}} {{sleeping}} senator hung his portrait, {{in which he}} was modestly represented as rising by the assistance of Minerva to the top of Parnassus, the nine Muses standing round him rejoicing. At his feet reposed a magnificent white cat, whose head rested in all the luxurious laziness of satiety {{on the edge of a}} golden saucer half filled with dormice stewed in milk. The most indubitable evidences of the night's debauch appeared in Vetranio's disordered <b>dress</b> and <b>flushed</b> countenance as the freedman regarded him. For some minutes the worthy Carrio stood uncertain whether to awaken his master or not, deciding finally, however, on obeying the commands he had received, and disturbing the slumbers of the wearied voluptuary before him. To effect this purpose, it was necessary to call in the aid of the singing-boy; for, by a refinement of luxury, Vetranio had forbidden his attendants to awaken him by any other method than the agency of musical sounds.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, Biggs resurfaced in NWA: Total Nonstop Action as Disgraceland [...] who was {{introduced}} by Glen Gilberti as {{the newest member of}} the stable Sports Entertainment Xtreme after his debut defeating Shark Boy in Nashville, Tennessee on February 23, 2003. Following the match, Jorge Estrada of The Flying Elvises confronted Biggs over his Elvis impersonator gimmick and was attacked by Biggs, Gilberti and Mike Sanders who later dragged Estrada backstage to the S.E.X. <b>dressing</b> room and <b>flushed</b> his head in a toilet. Two weeks later, he would lose to Estrada after Gilberti and Sanders left ringside on March 5, 2003.|$|R
60|$|Even {{the modest}} Bertha was there, {{defending}} a breach {{in the garden}} wall with a big shawl, dishevelled in <b>dress</b> and hair, <b>flushed</b> in face, bold and resolute in aspect, laying about her with the vigour of an Amazon. The usually phlegmatic Conrad defended another weak point, while his at other times amiable spouse stood near him making fearful and frequent raids upon the foe with the branch of of a thorn-tree. Hans, like Gulliver among the Lilliputs, guarded a gate in company with four of his brothers, and they toiled and moiled like heroes, while perspiration rolled in streams from their blazing faces. Elsewhere men and women, boys and girls--black, brown, and yellow--exerted themselves to the uttermost.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} fatigue {{behaviour}} of thin AlMgSi 1 aluminium alloy weldments and {{the improvement in}} fatigue strength due to post-weld treatments. Several fatigue tests were performed using two distinct types of thin welded joints, T and single lap, manufactured using a 6 xxx series aluminium alloy, and the efficiency of fatigue life improvement techniques, such as post-weld heat treatment and <b>weld</b> toe's burr <b>dressing,</b> was studied. Both the post-weld heat treatment and the burr dressing produced a fatigue strength improvement. This fact is discussed, for both geometries, {{in the context of}} the initiation and propagation phases contribution to total fatigue life. Finally, several fatigue tests were performed under variable amplitude block loading using T 6 post-weld heat-treated single lap joints, and the correspondent fatigue lives were compared with the predictions of Miner's rule.

40|$|Weld pores redistribution, the {{effectiveness}} of using tungsten inert gas (TIG) <b>dressing</b> to remove <b>weld</b> pores, {{and changes in the}} mechanical properties due to the TIG dressing of Ti- 3 Al- 2. 5 V weldments were studied. Moreover, weld cracks due to pores were investigated. The results show that weld pores less than 300 Î¼m in size are redistributed or removed via remelting due to TIG dressing. Regardless of the temperature condition, TIG <b>dressing</b> <b>welding</b> showed ductility, and there was a loss of 7 % tensile strength of the weldments. Additionally, it was considered that porosity redistribution by TIG dressing was due to fluid flow during the remelting of the weld pool. Weld cracks in titanium weldment create branch cracks around pores that propagate via the intragranular fracture, and oxygen is dispersed around the pores. It is suggested that the pore locations around the LBZ (local brittle zone) and stress concentration due to the pores have significant effects on crack initiation and propagation...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of residual stresses in a structure influences his behaviour. Fatigue strength of welded joints is significantly {{influenced by the}} {{presence of}} residual stresses, of flaws and notch sharpness at the <b>weld</b> toe. Plasma <b>dressing</b> at the <b>weld</b> toe is frequently used to remove flaws and to lessen the notch sharpness at the weld toe. With this re-melt, the stress field in the weld toe is also profoundly modified. The Finite Element Method (FEM) proves to be effective to simulate the stress fields generated by welding. The simplified two-dimensional models (2 D) are efficient in this estimation. This paper presents a 2 D finite element model to predict the residual stresses generated by Plasma <b>dressing</b> at the <b>weld</b> toe of a T-joint. The welded T-joints are made in St 52 - 3 steel, are obtained by covered electrode process and improved with plasma dressing. The analysis was developed with the MSC. Marc finite element code. The estimated stress field is validated with experimental stress results obtained using X-ray diffractio...|$|R
