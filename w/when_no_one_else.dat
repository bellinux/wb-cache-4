5|$|Although {{the idea}} of {{becoming}} a marine zoologist interested him, Franco had always secretly wanted to become an actor but feared being rejected. He enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as an English major, but dropped out after his first year against his parents' wishes {{to pursue a career}} as an actor, since {{he would have had to}} wait two years to audition for their acting program. Franco instead chose to take acting lessons with Robert Carnegie at the Playhouse West. Around this time, Franco took up a late-night job at McDonald's to support himself because his parents refused to do so. He was a vegetarian until working there. While working at the establishment, he would practice accents on customers, an experience he remembered nostalgically in a 2015 Washington Post editorial ("McDonald’s was there for me <b>when</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> was").|$|E
25|$|The recent Sino-Angolan {{association}} is illustrative. When a petroleum-rich area called for investment and rebuilding, China advanced a $5 billion loan to be repaid in oil. They sent Chinese technicians, fixing {{a large part}} of the electrical system, and leading a part of the reconstruction. In the short term Angola benefits from Chinese-built roads, hospitals, schools, hotels, football stadiums, shopping centers and telecommunications projects. In turn, Angola mortgaged future oil production of a valuable, non-renewable resource. It may turn out to be a costly trade for Angola, but their needs for infrastructure is immediate and that is precisely what China provideds <b>when</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> is willing to do so. And thusly, Angola has become China's leading energy supplier.|$|E
25|$|Philoctetes was Heracles' friend, {{and because}} he lit Heracles's funeral pyre <b>when</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> would, he {{received}} Heracles' bow and arrows. He sailed with seven ships full of men to the Trojan War, where he was planning on fighting for the Achaeans. They stopped either at Chryse Island for supplies, or in Tenedos, {{along with the rest}} of the fleet. Philoctetes was then bitten by a snake. The wound festered and had a foul smell; on Odysseus's advice, the Atreidae ordered Philoctetes to stay on Lemnos. Medon took control of Philoctetes's men. While landing on Tenedos, Achilles killed king Tenes, son of Apollo, despite a warning by his mother that if he did so he would be killed himself by Apollo. From Tenedos, Agamemnon sent an embassy to Priam, composed of Menelaus, Odysseus, and Palamedes, asking for Helen's return. The embassy was refused.|$|E

25|$|A new villainous Star Sapphire {{debuted in}} Green Lantern Vol 5 #21 (August 2013). Prixiam Nol-Anj {{was a former}} {{prisoner}} of the Oan sciencells, imprisoned for a slew of different crimes: racketeering, smuggling, extortion, murder for hire, abduction, trafficking in organisms, larceny, grand theft starship, and assault with an energy weapon. Over time, she uses her wiles to beguile her guard, a Green Lantern named Cossite, and he {{falls in love with}} her. When Larfleeze attacks Oa {{in the aftermath of the}} First Lantern's defeat and the death of the Guardians, his constructs kill a Star Sapphire who arrived to aid in the defense of the planet. The fallen Sapphire's ring flies to Nol-Anj's cell, where it declares her eligible to become a Star Sapphire herself. Nol-Anj persuades Cossite that the ring's presence is proof that her love for him is true, and he readily opens the door and allows her to slip the ring onto her fingers and acquire its power. To his understandable shock, she then kills him, declaring that the love in her heart that the ring detected was not for him, but for the Clann she belonged to, that accepted her <b>when</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> would.|$|E
25|$|After Jesse Owens {{returned}} from the 1936 Olympics, Robinson befriended him. Despite his fame from his four Olympic track wins, undermining Adolf Hitler's claims of Aryan supremacy, Owens found most of the offers {{that had been made}} to employ him had been nothing more than publicity stunts that had no substance. Robinson was the one exception, finding work for Owens within a few months of his return to the U.S. Robinson also introduced Owens to his manager, Marty Forkins, who secured a series of demonstration races for Owens which were viewed by many as degrading to the dignity of an Olympic athlete, most notably an event in Cuba in which Owens raced against a horse. As a result, Forkins and Robinson were viewed as having taken advantage of Owens. According to Forkins’ son, Robinson had told Owens that he should start running demonstration races that would both earn money for him and keep him in the public eye. Robinson had done many such races (including a race in which he set the world record for running backwards) and did not view them as undignified. Moreover, the events paid Owens well and provided him with a source of funds <b>when</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> was offering him employment or helping him financially. Owens made a gift to Robinson of one of his four Olympic gold medals, as a gesture of gratitude for the help Robinson had given him.|$|E

500|$|In Space was {{released}} on September 27, 2005 on the Rykodisc label. Recorded during 2004, the album consisted of new material mostly co-written by Chilton, Stephens, Auer, and Stringfellow. Reviewing In Space, Rolling Stones David Fricke first {{pointed out that the}} context of the release was now [...] "a world expecting that American Beatles ideal all over again" [...] from a band that [...] "achieved its power-pop perfection <b>when</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> was looking." [...] In Fricke's estimation, this seemingly unrealistic expectation was met in part: [...] "It's here – in the jangly longing and ice-wall harmonies of 'Lady Sweet'" [...] – however, Fricke found that the successful songs were interleaved with [...] "the eccentric R and demo-quality glam rock that have made Chilton's solo records a mixed blessing," [...] and that [...] "'A Whole New Thing' starts out like old T.Rex, then goes nowhere special." [...] Warming nevertheless to [...] "the rough sunshine" [...] of [...] "Best Chance," [...] Fricke concluded, [...] "In Space is no #1 Record, but at its brightest, it is Big Star in every way." ...|$|E

Howie Weinberg started working alone <b>when</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> showed up at the appointed time in the studio; by the time Nirvana, Andy Wallace, and Gary Gersh arrived, Weinberg had mastered most of the album. One of the songs mastered at the session, a hidden track called [...] "Endless, Nameless" [...] intended to appear at the end of [...] "Something in the Way", was accidentally left off initial pressings of the album. Weinberg recalled, [...] "In the beginning, {{it was kind of a}} verbal thing to put that track at the end. Maybe I misconstrued their instructions, so you can call it my mistake if you want. Maybe I didn't write it down when Nirvana or the record company said to do it. So, when they pressed the first twenty thousand or so CDs, albums, and cassettes, it wasn't on there." [...] When the band discovered the song's omission after listening to its copy of the album, Cobain called Weinberg and demanded he rectify the mistake. Weinberg complied and added about ten minutes of silence between the end of [...] "Something in the Way" [...] and the start of the hidden track on future pressings of the album.|$|E

40|$|Why {{does it seem}} {{inevitable}} {{for us to see}} Shakespeare as “political” <b>when</b> {{for centuries}} <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> did? A weak response to this problem is to ignore it, asserting instead that what Shakespeare and his peers had to say about politics is a lot less interesting than what we want to say they said. A stronger comeback is to claim that “political” literary criticism brings to light material that before was invisible or dimly perceived. Looked at in this way, political or materialist criticism is not some outré method for studying literature but, like all really significant discussion of art, ultimately a criticism of life itself, part of the perennial struggle over the meaning of human existence...|$|R
