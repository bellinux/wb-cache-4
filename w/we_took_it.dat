500|$|In 899, the Qarmatians, a millenarian Ismaili Muslim sect seized Bahrain, {{seeking to}} create a utopian society based on reason and {{redistribution}} of property among initiates. Thereafter, the Qarmatians demanded tribute from the caliph in Baghdad, and in 930 sacked Mecca and Medina, bringing the sacred Black Stone back to their base in Ahsa, in medieval Bahrain, for ransom. According to historian Al-Juwayni, the stone was returned 22 years later in 951 under mysterious circumstances. Wrapped in a sack, it was thrown into the Great Mosque of Kufa in Iraq, accompanied by a note saying [...] "By command <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>it,</b> and by command we have brought it back."

500|$|According to the {{historian}} al-Juwayni, the Stone was returned twenty-three years later, in 952. The Qarmatians held the Black Stone for ransom, {{and forced the}} Abbasids to pay a huge sum for its return. It was wrapped in a sack and thrown into the Friday Mosque of Kufa, accompanied by a note saying [...] "By command <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>it,</b> and by command we have brought it back." [...] Its abduction and removal caused further damage, breaking the stone into seven pieces. Its abductor, Abu Tahir, {{is said to have}} met a terrible fate; according to Qutb al-Din, [...] "the filthy Abu Tahir was afflicted with a gangrenous sore, his flesh was eaten away by worms, and he died a most terrible death". To protect the shattered stone, the custodians of the Kaaba commissioned a pair of Meccan goldsmiths to build a silver frame to surround it, and it has been housed within a similar frame ever since.|$|E

500|$|A {{group of}} four or five {{teenagers}} aged between 14 and 16 claim to have been playing near a cave in Cerro Azul, Panama when the creature emerged. They say that it approached them, and, fearing for their safety, they attacked the creature with sticks and rocks, killing it. They claim that they then threw its corpse into a pool of water before leaving the area. They later returned and took photographs of the creature's corpse, before sending the pictures to Telemetro, a Panamanian television station. Virginia Wheeler, writing for The Sun, claimed that the discovery [...] "sparked fear and confusion" [...] in the town. According to some sources, subsequent photographs were taken of the creature after it had further decomposed; however, doubts have been expressed about whether the later photos were of the same specimen. A few days after the photographs were taken, one of the teenagers gave a different account in an interview with Telemetro Reporta, saying [...] "I was in the river and I felt something grabbing my legs ... <b>We</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> {{out of the water and}} started throwing rocks and sticks at it. We had never seen anything like that." [...] The photographs show a pale creature that is mostly hairless, with a rubbery body. It has [...] "revolting features"; a snub-nose and long arms. Writers for the Huffington Post said that while the head is clearly animal, the torso is [...] "strange", while the limbs are reminiscent of thin human arms. Writers for WBALTV.com compared it to both a [...] "small, portly" [...] version of the alien in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and The Lord of the Ringss Gollum's [...] "long-lost cousin".|$|E

[...] However, Medley initially felt that the song didn't suit their more up-tempo rhythm and blues style, and Mann and Spector had sung the song in a higher key: [...] "And we just thought, [...] "Wow, what a good song for The Everly Brothers." [...] But it didn't seem right for us." [...] The song, which has a very big range, was originally written at a higher key of F.

2500|$|While {{attending}} Washtenaw Community College, Atkins met Rick Davis {{and formed}} Cybotron with him.

Eddie Fowlkes, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, and Robert Hood also recorded on Metroplex. May said that the suburban setting afforded a different setting in which to experience the music. [...] "We perceived the music differently than you would if you encountered it in dance clubs. We'd sit back with the lights off and listen to records by Bootsy and Yellow Magic Orchestra. We never took it as just entertainment, <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> as a serious philosophy," [...] recalls May.|$|E
2500|$|Georg {{was offered}} a {{position}} in the Kriegsmarine, but this occurred before the Anschluss. He was heavily recruited by the Nazis because he had extensive experience with submarines, and Germany was looking to expand its fleet of U-boats. With his family in desperate financial straits, and having no other marketable skills other than his training as a naval officer, he seriously considered the offer before deciding he could not serve a Nazi regime. Rather than threaten arrest, the Nazis actually continued to woo him. In the film, Georg is depicted initially as a humorless, emotionally distant father. In reality, third child Maria von Trapp (called [...] "Louisa" [...] in the film) described her father as a doting parent who made handmade gifts for the children in his woodshop and who would often lead family musicales on his violin. She has a different recollection of her stepmother, whom she described as moody and prone to outbursts of rage.

Chief Black Fox (c. 1800-c. 1880) had two wives who were sisters who bore him {{thirteen}} children. Iron Cedar Woman, the youngest sister, was Flying Hawk's mother and had five children. The other wife had eight children. [...] "In a fight with the Crows, Chief Black Fox was shot below the right eye with an arrow.
