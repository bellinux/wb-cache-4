This type {{has the potential to}} be the most lucrative for the performer because there are likely to be more donations from larger audiences if they are entertained by the act. Good buskers control the crowd so patrons do not obstruct foot traffic. The second form, the <b>walk-by</b> act, has no distinct beginning or end. Typically, the busker provides an entertaining ambience, often with an unusual instrument, and the audience may not stop to watch or form a crowd. Sometimes a <b>walk-by</b> act spontaneously turns into a circle show. The third form, café busking, is performed mostly in restaurants, pubs, bars and cafés. This type of act occasionally uses public transport as a venue.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{speculate}} the physical mechanisms of contaminant leakage during sash movement and <b>walk-bys</b> through a laboratory fume cupboard, the complicated three-dimensional flow patterns and the real-time tracer gas leakage are studied via the laser-assisted flow visualization method {{and the standard}} gas sampling technique, respectively, over a transparent, full scale chemical fume cupboard. Through the flow visualization, the evolution of drastic changes of the flow pattern is demonstrated. The highly turbulent jet-like currents are induced by the unsteady flow motion near the cupboard face. Large-scale turbulent eddies accompanied with the jet-like currents obviously bring large amount of in-cupboard smoke out to the atmosphere. The turbulent mixing extends the size {{and the strength of}} the large-scale eddy circulations, and predominantly contributes to the mechanism that causes the severe spread of contaminant leakage in few seconds. The tracer gas tests that are conducted by employing pr-EN 14175 : 2003 method show consistent containment results with the flow visualization findings. The temporally evolving large-scale turbulent eddies induced by the sash movement and the <b>walk-bys</b> cause substantially high contaminant leakage to the environment and the breathing zone of the operator...|$|R

5000|$|The primary {{driver for}} the {{automation}} of meter reading {{is not to}} reduce labor costs, but to obtain data {{that is difficult to}} obtain. As an example, many water meters are installed in locations that require the utility to schedule an appointment with the homeowner in order to obtain access to the meter. In many areas, consumers have demanded that their monthly water bill be based on an actual reading, instead of (for example) an estimated monthly usage based on just one actual meter reading made every 12 months. Early AMR systems often consisted of <b>walk-by</b> and drive-by AMR for residential customers, and telephone-based AMR for commercial or industrial customers. What was once a need for monthly data became a need for daily and even hourly readings of the meters. Consequently, the sales of drive-by and telephone AMR has declined in the US, while sales of fixed networks has increased. The US Energy Policy Act of 2005 asks that electric utility regulators consider the support for a [...] "...time-based rate schedule (to) enable the electric consumer to manage energy use and cost through advanced metering and communications technology." [...] The trend now is to consider the use of advanced meters as part of an Advanced Metering Infrastructure.|$|E
40|$|Laser-assisted flow-visualization {{experiments}} and tracer gas concentration tests were con-ducted for the wall-mounted and jet-isolated range hoods {{to examine the}} physical mechanisms and relative magnitudes of hood spillages. The effects of a mannequin {{standing in front of}} the test rig and <b>walk-by</b> motions (which are situations always encountered in kitchens) were em-phasized. The results showed that a mannequin (or a cook) {{standing in front of the}} counter would attract oil fumes toward the mannequin’s body, induce large turbulent flows, and cause a significant dispersion of oil fumes into the environment through the front edge of the hood. Very high tracer gas concentrations were detected around the breathing zone of the manne-quin. Increasing the suction flow rate did not reduce the spillage levels of the wall-mounted range hood but could moderately lower those of the jet-isolated hood. Serious spillages from both the wall-mounted and jet-isolated range hoods were detected as the simulated <b>walk-by</b> motion was performed. The jet-isolated range hood presented a much lower robustness in re-sisting the influence of people’s walk-bys than did the wall-mounted range hood. In summary, both the wall-mounted and jet-isolated range hoods were vulnerable to the influences of a cook’s presence and a cook’s <b>walk-by</b> motions. Increasing the suction flow rate might not obtain satisfactorily low spillages of pollutants but might increase noise level and energy consumption...|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{one of the}} {{important}} effects of sustainable urban environments is motivating people for outdoor activities. The phenomena of street simultaneously come from the west into urban spaces with automobile and designers doesnt have much of a role to set and design of this space in relation to physical activities. Consequently these spaces are not adjusted to the walking behavior of people. In order to encourage walking among people {{it is important to know}} how pedestrian travel pattern can be affected by the physical environment. The aim of this paper is to show the influences of physical characteristics spaces and land use of neighborhood Commercial Street in the Johor Bahru City Centre of Malaysia to the behavioral responses and attitudes of people. In this research the inquiry employed a multiple-method survey involving a variety of techniques including direct observation <b>walk-by</b> observation and pedestrian counts to collect data on the behavior of people on the street. The result shows that a commercial street with high population should have various Spaces with impressive physical characteristics that each user with different attitude is able to recognize their required spaces and use it with satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} the <b>walk-by</b> motion and sash {{movement}} on the containment leakage of an air curtain-isolated fume hood were evaluated and compared {{with the results of}} a corresponding conventional fume hood. The air curtain was generated by a narrow planar jet issued from the double-layered sash and a suction slot-flow arranged {{on the floor of the}} hood just behind the doorsill. The conventional fume hood used for comparison had the major dimensions identical to the air-curtain hood. SF 6 tracer-gas concentrations were released and measured following the prEN 14175 - 3 : 2003 protocol to examine the contaminant leakage levels. Experimental results showed that operating the air-curtain hood at the suction velocity above about 6 m/s and jet velocity about 1 m/s could provide drastically high containment performance when compared with the corresponding conventional fume hood operated at the face velocity of 0. 5 m/s. The total air flow required for the air-curtain hood operated at 6 m/s suction velocity and 1 m/s jet velocity was about 20 % less than that exhausted by the conventional fume hood. If the suction velocity of the air-curtain hood was increased above 8 m/s, the containment leakage during dynamic motions could be reduced to ignorable level (about 10 – 3 ppm) ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} several years we have been {{developing}} large, interactive display surfaces for collaboration uses in a variety of work settings. People in small work groups can easily create, annotate and share media with their partners. The Blueboard, developed at IBM Research, is a large display system for groups to use in exchanging information in a lightweight, informal collaborative way. It began as a large, ubiquitously placed display surface for <b>walk-by</b> use in a corporate setting and has evolved in response to task demands and user needs. At NASA, the MERBoard is being designed to support surface operations for the upcoming Mars Exploration Rover Missions. The MERBoard extends the design to support the collaboration requirements for viewing, annotating, linking and distributing information for the science and engineering teams that will operate two rovers on the surface of Mars. Here we examine differing implementations of the same idea: a collaborative information tool that began from the same design goals, but which grew into somewhat different systems under the evolutionary pressures of the NASA and IBM task environments. Lessons about how media are designed, task requirements for collaborative use, information flow requirements and work practice drive the evolution of a system are illustrated. 1...|$|E
40|$|As the {{modernization}} of cities together with the increasing popularity of automobiles, streets are gradually losing the primordial function as space for public gathering, being occupied by motorized transportation. It {{has been more than}} 50 years since Jane Jacobs (1961) called for more emphasize on streets, many scholars (Gehl, J. 2000, 2006, 2006, 2010; Jacobs, A. B. 1993; Whyte, W. 1980) have been carrying on researches on liveability and vitality of urban streets, exploring the associations between built environment characters and active walking. While urban planning practitioners can hardly formulate applicable policies and design guidelines for designing lively streets from qualitative descriptions of street design qualities. Based on the latest built environment audit tools, the author tries to explore the connections between street design characteristics (SDC) and pedestrian behaviour (PB) by abstracting and representing the street design qualities. 50 street segments in two high-dense neighbourhoods in Hong Kong were studied in terms of network link density, network betweenness, density of business/service, permeability etc. Activity behaviour including walking, shopping, window shopping, chatting, sitting, jogging and walking pets etc. were mapped by the author through <b>walk-by</b> observation. Through statistical analysis, network accessibility, footpath width are found to be fundamental to street walkability, density of business/service, degree of personalization and permeability show significant associations with pedestrian interactions and sociality in streets. Some recommendations and the “Hierarchy of SDCs” are formulated {{at the end of this}} dissertation. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignMasterMaster of Science in Urban Plannin...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, the cities of Indonesia have {{experienced}} rapid development, with the transformation sometimes leading to improvements but often having a devastating impact on the urban environment. A worrying trend has been {{the reduction of the}} role of urban traditional streets in Indonesia as mixed-use and vibrant public places to become purely channels of movement, especially for car-based traffic. For this reason, this research focuses on assessing the quality of traditional streets in Indonesia and is being conducted before they disappear as a result of rapid development in urban areas. The primary aim of the research is to demonstrate the role of traditional streets in shaping the urban environment and urban public life. In this context, the research focuses on critically examining the distinctive characteristics of such streets through street quality indicators that have been developed in urban design discourses. A qualitative inquiry is chosen as the main research method with multiple case studies and a research strategy based on research questions, research knowledge, and expertise. The techniques to gain data were field observations (<b>walk-by</b> observations, pedestrian counts, and behavioural mapping) and in-depth interviews. The analysis procedure was a rationale-inductive method and relied on the data from the field work as the emerging information (data-led analysis). The research concludes that there are five major characteristics of traditional streets that play important roles to support urban public life; these are: the physical and visual quality of the street; traditional street as mixed-use urban space; as multi-cultural urban space; as a cultural path and public space of the city; and traditional street activities as intangible culture. The results of the study confirm the earlier findings that suggest that Asian street are vibrant places with mixed-use pavements that contribute significantly to the vibrancy of the city. This study adds to the knowledge of the potential of the traditional street in Indonesia as one of the primary urban spaces, as public space, as creative space, as cultural space, and as urban heritage that should be safeguarded and conserved for its outstanding value not only for its architectural diversity, but also for its intangible cultures. The research also recognises the important role of traditional streets in Indonesia to the contemporary city. The recognition of the integral entity of these streets including their economic, social, and the cultural life of the surrounding context have led to a better understanding in terms of research and can be part of the foundation to formulate better policy and design intervention for the future of Indonesian cities...|$|E
