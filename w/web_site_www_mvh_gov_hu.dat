40|$|The American College of Cardiology (ACC) /AmericanHeart Association (AHA) {{guidelines}} {{for the management of}} unstable angina and non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) were published in September 2000. 1 Since then, a number of clinical trials and observa-tional studies have been published or presented that, when taken together, alter significantly the recommendations made in that document. Therefore, the ACC/AHA Committee on the Management of Patients With Unstable Angina, with the concurrence of the ACC/AHA Task Force on Practice Guide-lines, revised these guidelines. These revisions were prepared in December 2001, reviewed and approved, and then pub-lished on the ACC World Wide <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> (<b>www.</b> acc. org) and AHA World Wide <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> (<b>www.</b> americanheart. org) on March 15, 2002.

40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide {{consumers}} with web-based {{information on the}} environmental effects of automobiles so that individuals can make informed choices about the vehicles they use or may purchase. DOE and EPA maintain a <b>web</b> <b>site</b> (<b>www.</b> fueleconomy. gov) that provides users with information about fuel economy [as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollution emissions] for the cars and trucks they use or may consider purchasing. EPA also maintains a separate <b>web</b> <b>site</b> (<b>www.</b> epa. gov/greenvehicles) that offers similar information, with the focus on air pollution emissions rather than fuel economy. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) (www. greenercars. com) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) (www. arb. ca. gov/msprog/ccbg/ccbg. htm) also maintain <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> that provide {{consumers with}} information on the environmental effects of automobiles. Through the National Transportation Research Center (NTRC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, DOE has supported some initial qualitative research {{with people who are}} interested in purchasing a new or used vehicle and whose actions identify them as at least somewhat concerned about the environment. The purpose of this research was to explore and understand how these people respond to the different ratings and measurements of environmental effects provided by the four <b>web</b> <b>sites.</b> The goal of the research is to optimize the communication of information provided on the DOE/EPA <b>web</b> <b>site</b> (<b>www.</b> fueleconomy. gov). Working with a private marketing research firm (The Looking Glass Group of Knoxville, Tennessee), NTRC staff initiated this research by meeting with two focus groups in Knoxville on February 27, 2001.
