25|$|The 1977–78 season {{represents}} {{the most significant}} in Centennials history as the team would experience achievements yet to be matched. Buoyed {{by the addition of}} players like Ken Stroud, Rob Polman-Tuin, and Kelly Ferner, and the development of returnees like Beers and Sirkia, the Cents rocketed {{to the top of the}} BCJHL standings, finishing the season with a record of 50–15–1 for a franchise record 101 points. That total stands as the fourth most ever points accumulated by one team in a season in BCHL history.

Stroud, Ferner, Beers, and Sirkia would all <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> BCJHL's top 15 in scoring, each with more than 111 points while Pat Rabbitt and Blake Stephen chipped in with 93 points each. Merritt also had four 50-plus goal scorers in Stroud, Ferner, Beers, and Rabbitt. Stroud's 86 assists that season still stands as a team record.|$|E

500|$|Mills portrayed Abby from 1980–1989. Prior {{to being}} cast in Knots Landing, Mills was {{primarily}} known {{for playing the}} [...] "damsel in distress" [...] archetype in both film and television media. The actress became somewhat famous for playing these roles, often leading to unwanted typecasting. In an interview with Jerry Buck for the Toledo Blade, Mills said: [...] "I got tired of playing the victim. It's a more active role. Abby keeps things stirred up, and I like that." [...] According to Jacobs, Abby was not planned when the show began. He knew that he wanted a female J.R. Ewing-esque character. However, he had a different sense of the character and who would <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> role. With Mills' reputation of playing the victim, he initially didn't choose her for the part.|$|E

500|$|By November 1936, 16,170 pieces {{had been}} sold. Only about 2,000 more {{were sold in}} the next four months; Hoffecker's {{statement}} for March 1937 shows 18,790 sold with an additional 330 on consignment to the First National Bank of Elgin. Rovelstad had received $8,680.00 and Hoffecker $6,576.50. [...] At this point, discussion turned to {{what to do with the}} remaining pieces, some 5,620 (a few hundred pieces were given away or otherwise disposed of). [...] Rovelstad agreed to allow the coin dealer to purchase 250 pieces at $1 each; he was still selling them in 1948. [...] Other dealers were uninterested in large purchases as the direct sale to collectors meant that few who wanted and could afford the Elgin coin lacked it. With demand at a standstill, Hoffecker feared that the remaining pieces would <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of speculators. [...] Five thousand pieces were returned to the Mint for melting.|$|E

The North Pacific Gyre, for example, has collected the so-called [...] "Great Pacific Garbage Patch", which is now estimated to be one hundred {{times the size of}} Texas. Plastic debris can absorb toxic chemicals from ocean pollution, potentially poisoning any creature that eats it. Many of these long-lasting pieces <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stomachs of marine birds and animals. This results in obstruction of digestive pathways, which leads to reduced appetite or even starvation.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson sought to annex Florida from Spain, as {{brokered}} by Napoleon. Congress agreed to the President's request to secretly appropriate purchase money in the [...] "$2,000,000 Bill". The Congressional funding drew criticism from Randolph, who believed that the money would <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coffers of Napoleon. The bill was signed into law; however, negotiations for the project failed. Jefferson lost clout among fellow Republicans, and his use of unofficial Congressional channels was sharply criticized. In Haiti, Jefferson's neutrality had allowed arms to enable the slave independence movement during its Revolution, and blocked attempts to assist Napoleon, who was defeated there in 1803. But he refused official recognition of the country during his second term, in deference to southern complaints about the racial violence against slave-holders; it was eventually extended to Haiti in 1862. Domestically, Jefferson's grandson James Madison Randolph became the first child born in the White House in 1806.|$|E
