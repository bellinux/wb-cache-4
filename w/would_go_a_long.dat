5|$|While the Ordainers {{were at work}} {{drafting}} their reform document, Edward {{decided to}} address {{one of the main}} causes behind the discontent: the Scottish situation. Edward II had, almost immediately after his accession, abandoned the relentless Scottish campaigns of his father. As a result, Robert the Bruce had been able to regain the initiative in the war, reconquer lost territory, and stage destructive raids into the north of England. To aggravate matters, Edward had continued to raise extortionate taxes, ostensibly for the war in Scotland, but without showing any result. If the King could produce victory against the Scots, this <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way towards undermining the work of the Ordainers. In June, the King summoned the magnates for a military campaign, but most of the Ordainers refused {{on the basis of the}} work they were performing. When the King departed for Scotland in September, only Gloucester, Warenne and Gaveston among the earls accompanied him. The campaign proved frustrating for Edward, when Bruce refused to engage in open battle, or even get involved in negotiations. In February, Gaveston was sent with an army north from Roxburgh to Perth, but he failed to track down the Scottish army.|$|E

"Aura", this set's opener, {{manages to}} be a {{multitude}} of songs at once, jumping from nosebleed bass to (Middle) Eastern-coloured tones, a Spaghetti Western monologue to a stars-bound middle-eight, from quite-deliberately provocative talk of slavery {{and the meaning of}} the burqa to mindless cosmic love waffle. [...] "Do {{you want to see the}} girl who lives behind the aura?" [...] Lady Gaga asks us. Sure. A little of the real <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way after the smoke and mirrors defining her career to date.|$|E

6000|$|... "You are {{an older}} man, {{and he is}} easily led. <b>A</b> hint <b>would</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way, and he doesn't resent good-humored {{firmness}} from those he likes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I, too, am sorry," [...] agreed Zellerndorf. [...] "I {{can assure}} you that the news we hoped Captain Maenck would bring from America <b>would</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way toward {{restoring}} you to the confidence and good graces of the king." ...|$|R
30|$|In {{conclusion}} {{the current}} emphasis on rice blast disease should be {{how to control}} the disease. Therefore, emphasis should be in developing rice cultivars with adequate levels of resistant/tolerance to the disease. Sound crop management practices <b>would</b> also <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way to minimize the losses caused by the pathogen in Mwea region.|$|R

6000|$|... "So, you see, Welland," [...] {{continued}} Brisbane, [...] "your {{glass of}} sherry <b>would</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{way in the}} domestic calculations of a poor old woman, who very likely once had sons who were as fond of her and as proud of her, as you now are of your own mother." ...|$|R

"Summit Circle, {{with its}} deliberate, {{undifferentiated}} calmness, {{is a prime}} example of soporific filmmaking, not because it's dull (it's not) but because it's determined that no outbursts, whether of joy or sorrow, will muss up the benumbing tranquility. A little shake-up <b>would</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way toward making this tragedy a more affecting work." [...] -Variety ...|$|R
5000|$|With {{the success}} of their {{respective}} solo ventures, the group <b>would</b> <b>go</b> on <b>a</b> <b>long</b> hiatus until the eventual release of their second, and possibly last album, The Ultimate Weapon(Saishuu Heiki). It was released in 2002. Unlike the debut album which saw beatmaking duties split largely between ZEEBRA and DJ OASIS, [...] "Saishuu Heiki" [...] was mostly produced by DJ OASIS.|$|R
6000|$|... "And a {{word from}} you <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way with her,--as it ought. If she knows {{that you would like}} her to marry her cousin, it will make her think it her duty--" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the man in}} {{the yellow}} house had given him a dollar for fixing his {{electric}} refrigerator. Nobody else had been able to fix it, not even the factory man. The dollar <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way. A dollar was a lot.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Chudleigh {{admired his}} daring, {{which was what}} had first {{attracted}} her. His shortcomings were not hidden, he now and then offended her more cultivated taste, but he could boldly seize an opportunity and she thought he <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way. There was force in him.|$|E
5000|$|The loss of Albert Johnston was a {{particularly}} severe blow to the Confederacy. President Jefferson Davis called it [...] "the turning point of our fate." [...] For {{the remainder of the}} war, the Confederate armies in the West <b>would</b> <b>go</b> through <b>a</b> <b>long</b> string of commanders, much like the Union in the east, as Davis searched for a leader who was the caliber of Robert E. Lee.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{they would}} not have kept us dry, but they <b>would</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way towards keeping us warm. It would be like putting oilskin over wet lint; we should have felt as if we were in a hot {{poultice}} in a short time. And even while riding {{it would have been very}} comfortable, if we had worn them as we did the blankets, with a hole in the middle to put our heads through." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Last night, Mr. Cossey," [...] he said, [...] "you thought {{proper to}} {{publicly}} bring a charge against me, which {{if it were}} true <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way towards showing that I was not a fit person to associate with those before whom it was brought." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{his review}} in Variety, Peter Debruge said, [...] "The {{characters}} {{seem to be}} doing all the laughing, while the general public has nothing to cling to but the horndog flirtation between mismatched leads William H. Macy and Meg Ryan - hardly ideal ingredients for mainstream success [...] [...] [...] Elliott Gould gets laughs as the credit-hungry rabbi pulled in to consult on the film, although a few A-list celebrity cameos in the movie-star roles <b>would</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way toward completing the illusion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Questa vindow; vindow orizhinalle," [...] {{he would}} say, {{meaning that the}} opening that he was {{pointing}} to {{was one of the}} original windows of the edifice.

50|$|David Phillips {{winner was}} enough to sink Wimbledon at Carrow Road. This meant that Norwich had now {{extended}} their lead {{at the top of}} the Premiership to 8 points. Norwich travelled to Old Trafford in confident mood ahead of the game against Manchester United. The game was settled by a goal from Mark Hughes who capitalized on a mistake by Daryl Sutch to fire past Bryan Gunn. It was a watershed moment for the Canaries who were about to embark on a 6 match winless run which <b>would</b> ultimately <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way towards costing them the title.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{just the}} point. It's my {{intention}} to alter {{it as soon as}} possible, and a bonanza harvest this year <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way toward setting me on my feet. In the meanwhile, it seems only fitting that I should put up with popular opinion, and try to bear in mind my disabilities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{his wishes}} ought to count. You must see that your {{position}} at Allenwood won't be easy; {{it will need}} some tact to make it comfortable, and your giving me the post <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> distance in your favor. You can't afford to disregard our people's feelings until you've made your footing good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} one could venture to mention that your {{interest}} in the woman I brought down from the bush <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way?" [...] he said.

6000|$|... "He is {{an honorary}} colonel of the regiment, and only does duty {{when it is}} called on active service; but he served in it for some years as a young man, and had the {{reputation}} of being a good soldier, though I know that he was considered a harsh and unfeeling officer by the men who served under him. That is the man, Ronald, and if you could get six inches of your sword between his ribs it <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> good <b>long</b> way towards obtaining your father's release; but I warn you he is said {{to be one of the}} best swordsmen in France." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{piece was}} {{produced}} under {{the management of}} Charles Wyndham at the Criterion Theatre, London, opening on 27 July 1892. It closed on 20 August 1892, after a run of just 22 performances. Although a failure, the opera introduced the 18-year-old George Grossmith, Jr., the composer's son, to the London stage.

60|$|In {{countries}} which are further advanced in industry and population, and have therefore {{a lower rate}} of profit, than others, there is always, long before the actual minimum is reached, a practical minimum, viz., when profits have fallen so much below what they are elsewhere that, were they to fall lower, all further accumulations <b>would</b> <b>go</b> abroad. <b>As</b> <b>long</b> as there are old countries where capital increases very rapidly, and new countries where profit is still high, profits in the old countries will not sink to the rate which would {{put a stop to}} accumulation: the fall is stopped at the point which sends capital abroad.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Wonderfully lucky. I am more thankful than I can express; the {{evidence}} of that man alone <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way towards clearing my friend, for it would at any rate prove that just after these robberies were committed, and at the exact time at which a thief would reach here from England, a woman precisely like her arrived here with a man answering to {{the description of the}} one believed to be her accomplice.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Her {{story was}} a lie from {{beginning}} to end," [...] Peter said, [...] "and {{it is quite possible}} that it was a got-up thing, on purpose to see whether we could talk Spanish well.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Winston, with {{a little}} smile, [...] "that is a trifle too deep for me, and it's {{difficult}} to think of anything but the work I have to do. But {{you were the first}} at Silverdale to hold out a hand to me--and I have a feeling that your good wishes <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way now.

2500|$|Josiah Renaudin from GameSpot {{gave the}} game an 8/10 and wrote: [...] "NBA 2K16 draws you in with its {{welcoming}} personality and expanded game modes. But it still manages to push you away with unexplained intricacies. A deep tutorial <b>would</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way toward making the new passing and screening maneuvers easier to incorporate into your game, {{and at this}} point, it’s inexcusable that this game still struggles online. Still, the fact that NBA 2K16 is a great basketball experience can’t be ignored.
