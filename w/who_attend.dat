The students <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> the combined course achieved considerably higher results on both tests compared to the students <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> the traditional course.

5|$|Shiny Festa is {{a series}} of three rhythm games that feature various {{characters}} and songs from The Idolmaster video game franchise.

The characters <b>who</b> <b>attend</b> the music festival, as well as the songs and episode that correspond to the characters, are dependent on the version of the game.

5|$|Spirit Splash occurs the Friday {{before the}} Homecoming game, {{and serves as}} a pep rally where {{students}} descend into the pond to demonstrate school spirit.

Along with the thousands of students <b>who</b> <b>attend,</b> there are members of the community, local dignitaries, alumni, children and even dogs who come to join in on the festivities. Knightro, the Marching Knights, cheerleaders, student athletes, and dancers all participate in the pep rally, usually followed by a concert. Spirit Splash was made possible in part by weight testing performed on the Reflecting Pond in preparation for President Richard Nixon's visit to the university to speak at its 1973 commencement. It was determined {{that the best way to}} protect the president would be to hold commencement in the pond itself, after being drained, so that Secret Service agents could be stationed on the roofs of the adjacent buildings.|$|E

The second half of the video, set {{in the small town of}} Rathdrum, County Wicklow. showed the group interacting with young girls in various activities, such as running around the streets dancing, skipping rope, playing hopscotch, cat's cradle and pat-a-cake, hula hooping, Geri horseback riding, and participating in competitions of various kinds. The locals are depicted as working-class people <b>who</b> <b>attend</b> the local fair or have a drink in the pub.

Data existed on <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> Pre-K, <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> other forms of preschool, and <b>who</b> had not <b>attended</b> preschool of any kind, as indicated by parent survey at kindergarten entry. The comparison group was limited to children <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> no preschool of any kind, while the treatment group contained only children <b>who</b> <b>attended</b> the district-run public Pre-K program. Propensity score matching to approximate baseline equivalence between the treatment and comparison groups was chosen because it can reduce selection bias to an acceptable minimum, permitting a degree of causal inference {{in the absence of}} random assignment (Stuart and Rubin 2004).|$|R

In the anime, she is very much enamored with Hikari, but Hikari sees her as a friend; in the manga, Yaya is not a prominent character. Both she and Hikari {{are members of the}} St. Spica Choir. Hikari meets an older girl named Amane Ohtori early on in the story who is seen much like a prince from a fairy tale by other Spica students due to often riding a white horse named Star Bright. Amane is admired by many of the students from Spica as well as students from the other two schools, although she does not enjoy the attention. In the anime, Hikari admires her deeply, and she and Amane have mutual interest in each other. The final girl from Spica is Tsubomi Okuwaka, a young first year student who acts maturely for her age and gets on Yaya's nerves. She too is in the St. Spica Choir, although Hikari was her main motivation for joining. In the anime, her interest in Hikari seems to purely be one of friendship; in the manga, she, like Yaya, is not a prominent character.
