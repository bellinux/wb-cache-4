However, there were some problems with expatriate voting as the embassy in Germany ran out of ballots on 9 April forcing an extension to 11 April. The expatriate vote was considerably higher than in the previous election, up from 8.6% in 2007 to 15%. The Foreign Ministry said that {{out of a total of}} 228,000 expatriates eligible to vote 35,049 cast their ballots at the Finnish diplomatic missions, which <b>was</b> <b>up</b> from 27,399.|$|E

Brunner's name was mentioned as a potential Democratic candidate for the seat. On January 23, 2009, Brunner and Ohio Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher met to discuss the possibility that either of them would run, but did not confirm any decision or leanings to the media.|$|E
5|$|Cody {{personally}} {{took over}} the Auburn game after Vanderbilt <b>was</b> <b>up</b> 17–0. In {{one of the greatest}} exhibitions of punt covering, Cody smothered the receiver every time, recovering two fumbles, including one across the goal line for a touchdown.

5|$|Coverage of {{this event}} varied {{significantly}} between Nashville's two major newspapers. The Tennessean emphasized the mayor's agreement that lunch counters should be desegregated, while the Nashville Banner emphasized the mayor's statement that it <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to the city's merchants {{to decide whether to}} desegregate. This was largely indicative of the two papers' opposing stances on the issue. Regardless, the mayor's response was later cited as an important turning point by both activists and Nashville business owners.|$|E
5|$|During Playford's rule, {{hospitals}} were overcrowded and the Royal Adelaide Hospital's beds were crammed {{together with a}} density twice higher than developed world standards. After a media exposé and criticism from health sector professionals, two more {{hospitals were}} built in the western and northern suburbs of Adelaide respectively. Playford's attitude to social welfare was also criticised. He said that it <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to charity, not the government, to support orphans and disadvantaged sectors of the community so that they could enjoy a better standard of living. Spending on social welfare lagged behind that in other states, and legislative reforms on this front were non-existent.|$|E
5|$|During the 2013 Masters, Woods <b>was</b> <b>up</b> for {{disqualification}} over {{claims that}} he took an illegal drop on the par-5 15th hole after his third shot had bounced off of the pin and into the water.

Woods won The Players Championship in May 2013, his second career win at the event, notching his fourth win of the 2013 season. It was the quickest he had ever gotten to four wins in any season in his professional career.|$|E

5|$|Famously, {{the much}} smaller Greek army held the pass of Thermopylae against the Persians {{for three days}} before being outflanked by a {{mountain}} path. Much of the Greek army retreated, before the Spartans and Thespians who had continued to block the pass were surrounded and killed. The simultaneous Battle of Artemisium <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to that point a stalemate; however, when news of Thermopylae reached them, the Allied fleet also retreated, since holding the straits of Artemisium was now a moot point.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Supreme Court {{majority}} {{upheld the}} validity of {{another aspect of the}} law as enacted by Congress: that the government could assume that a potentially expatriating act had been performed voluntarily and that any claim that a person had acted under duress <b>was</b> <b>up</b> to the person involved to establish by preponderance of evidence.|$|E

She subsequently took {{a leading role in}} investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders. Clinton voted for the USA Patriot Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act <b>was</b> <b>up</b> for renewal, she expressed concerns with the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report regarding civil liberties, before voting in favor of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 in March 2006 that gained large majority support.|$|E

5|$|However, in {{the course}} of the speeches {{opposing}} the resolution, Johnston felt Lee's memory had been attacked and he felt duty bound to defend him. The Democratic Party, knowing his views and that of his state, approached him and asked him to keep silent for the sake of the party and the relief of Virginia. Johnston correctly predicted that he would be attacked at home. He <b>was</b> <b>up</b> for re-election, and the opposing candidates used his position against him. A delegation from the Virginia General Assembly travelled to Washington to talk with the Democrats and assess the situation and were satisfied by the reports they received.|$|E
5|$|Imamura <b>was</b> <b>up</b> {{against a}} resourceful, {{resolute}} and aggressive opponent, {{who also had}} access to good intelligence. Allied Ultra codebreakers were reading the Japanese shipping codes, and, by 3 January 1943, Allied commanders knew in advance about the force that Adachi was planning to send from Rabaul to Lae, although {{they did not know}} the force's ultimate destination. Blamey chose not to wait for this to become clear, but immediately ordered the 17th Infantry Brigade to move from Milne Bay to Wau on 4 January 1943. Its commander—Brigadier Murray Moten—was ordered to assume command of Kanga Force and defend Wau.|$|E
5|$|In 1788, Hamilton served {{yet another}} term in what {{proved to be}} the last session of the Continental Congress under the Articles of Confederation. When the term of Philip Schuyler <b>was</b> <b>up</b> in 1791, elected in his place was the {{attorney}} general of New York, one Aaron Burr. Hamilton blamed Burr for this result, and ill characterizations of Burr appear in his correspondence thereafter.
