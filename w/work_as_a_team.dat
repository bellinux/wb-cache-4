5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} live {{in groups}} typically of 10–30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single {{individuals up to}} more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of forage fish. Dolphins often <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> to harvest fish schools, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is similar to sonar. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication, including squeaks and whistles, as well as sounds emitted through body movements, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water surface.|$|E

25|$|An {{investigation}} was launched {{to determine whether}} any other officers should be disciplined. On January 12, investigation results were forwarded to the district attorney. The investigation, which interviewed seven police officers and 33 other witnesses, came to no conclusion and made no recommendations. The details were forwarded to Meyers Nave, an outside law firm, for an independent investigation. It was led by Jayne Williams, the former city attorney for San Leandro, and was estimated to cost $250,000. In August, the law firm provided two reports to BART but only released one publicly.

25|$|The show's initial stage, {{which is}} not filmed, focuses on open auditions and {{interviews}} held across the country; this stage searches for the candidates for a series before filming of it begins, which often attracts thousands of applicants. A second round will usually be held in London for {{a small percentage of}} applicants, who divide into groups and are asked to do various exercises to test their business skills and to gauge how they <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>team.</b> Following this, between 20 and 30 applicants are chosen and given an assessment by a psychologist, receiving further checks by the production team and providing them with references, before the final line-up is selected from this group and filming can begin. The number of candidates who appear in a series has varied over the show's history, though consists of a balanced number of men and women; for the first two series, the show featured 14 candidates, increased to 16 between Series 3 to 9 (the fifth series featured 15, as a candidate dropped out with little time left to find a replacement), and later 20 to mark the tenth year of the show (the highest number of any variation of The Apprentice), before eventually consisting of 18 candidates from the eleventh series.

25|$|After {{the success}} of ChickFight, Dave Prazak and Allison Danger set up Shimmer Women Athletes, a {{promotion}} with ties to Prazak's Ring of Honor intending to raise the credibility of women's wrestling on an international scale. Her first match with the promotion was on November 6, 2005, for Volume 1 in a losing effort to MsChif, starting a wild feud between the two. The loss saw Anderson demand a special attraction rematch—the match would be Shimmer's first hardcore match, fought under Falls Count Anywhere rules and helped Anderson gain the victory after nearly thirty minutes of wrestling on February 12, 2006, at Volume 4. MsChif took her revenge at Volume 5 by distracting Anderson during a match with Allison Danger, {{causing her to lose}} the match. Naturally the rivalry was not abated and their next match, main eventing Volume 6 on 21 May, was declared a Last Woman Standing match with MsChif eventually coming out on top. Further interferences took an interesting turn at Volume 7 when Anderson came out during MsChif's match against Rain. However, before she could interfere, Rain's partner Lacey pushed her to the ground while trying to distract the referee in order to allow Rain to use an illegal weapon; an incensed Anderson fought back against Lacey in time for the referee to see the foreign object in the ring and declare MsChif the winner via disqualification. After Anderson had won her main event match, Lacey and Rain (The Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew), ambushed her with a beat down until MsChif ran out, saving her nemesis before leaving her to celebrate the victory. The Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew had threatened Anderson for involving herself in their plans against MsChif and similarly threatened MsChif for being in the way of ambushing Melissa and, after declaring themselves the best tag team in the world, demanded a match with the two for Volume 8 which became the penultimate bout of the evening. The Home Wrecking Crew's experience won out over MsChif and Anderson when a double team maneuver led to MsChif being pinned; after the match Anderson and MsChif shook hands as a sign of respect. The two soon showed they could <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> though when they beat veterans The Experience (Lexie Fyfe and Malia Hosaka), with MsChif pinning Hosaka.|$|E

The developers upgraded the GoldenEye 007 engine with new features and graphical enhancements such as dynamic lighting, widescreen support, and the option to play in high resolution graphics mode. According to Rare, only 30% of the original engine remained, providing a basic framework to construct levels and animate characters. A new movement system was constructed, allowing players to fall off edges. Motion capture was used to create character animations: game designer Duncan Botwood wore a pair of high heels {{so that he could}} portray Joanna Dark in these sessions. The artificial intelligence was improved so that enemies could [...] "assess threats, <b>work</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> and communicate with each other." [...] Enemies were also given the ability to draw a secondary sidearm when disarmed. Other additions include more elaborate gore effects, which allow gunshots to disperse and stain enemies' blood onto nearby walls and objects, and a motion blurred graphical effect when the player is punched or tranquilised.|$|E
