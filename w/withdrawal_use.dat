40|$|Abstract Background Withdrawal as {{a method}} of birth control is still used in Iran. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore married women's {{perspectives}} and attitudes on <b>withdrawal</b> <b>use</b> instead of oral contraceptive (OC) in Tehran, Iran. Methods This was a qualitative study. Participants were 50 married women, not currently pregnant, not desiring pregnancy and who had been using withdrawal for contraception. Face-to face interviews were conducted to collect data. Content analysis was performed to analyze the data. Results Four major themes were extracted from the interviews: advantages, disadvantages, barriers for OC use, and husband-related factors. Advantages of <b>withdrawal</b> <b>use</b> were identified as: easy to use, convenient, ease of access, natural. Even those participants who had experienced unwanted pregnancy while using withdrawal, relied on withdrawal as their contraceptive method. Disadvantages of OC included concerns about side effects. Barriers related to use of OC included the need for medical advice, vaginal examination and daily use. Husband-related factors included: the husband wanted to be the primary decision maker on the number of children and that he preferred withdrawal. Conclusion Health providers should address misunderstandings that exist about OC and highlight the non-contraceptive health benefits of OC to balance the information provided for women. We suggest that not only women but also their spouses be advised in family planning programs. </p...|$|E

40|$|Withdrawal is {{sometimes}} referred to as the contraceptive method that is “better than nothing ” [1]. But, based on the evidence, it might more aptly be referred to as a method that is almost as effective as the male condom—at least when it comes to pregnancy prevention. If the male partner withdraws before ejaculation every time a couple has vaginal intercourse, about 4 % of couples will become pregnant {{over the course of a}} year [2]. However, more realistic estimates of typical use indicate that about 18 % of couples will become pregnant in a year using withdrawal [3]. These rates are only slightly less effective than male condoms, which have perfect- and typical-use failure rates of 2 % and 17 % 1, respectively [3].

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{understand}} why Turkey {{has one of the}} highest rates of withdrawal (coitus interruptus) use in the world. Despite a pronounced fertility decline, a marked increase in contraceptive prevalence, and expansion of family planning activities, in 1998 one in four Turkish couples relied on withdrawal, and this fraction has remained stable since 1983. In contrast to previous research that has focused on women's reports, here we use the husbands' module of the 1998 Turkish Demographic and Health Survey to examine user characteristics and attitudes, as well as the determinants of <b>withdrawal</b> <b>use</b> among a representative sample of 1950 currently married men in Turkey. Multivariate methods are employed to estimate these effects and the likelihood of using withdrawal rather than other methods. Among other findings, less egalitarian-minded husbands were more likely to select withdrawal over other contraceptive methods, but measures of male authority had only partial predictive power after controlling for other variables. Although <b>withdrawal</b> <b>use</b> typically reflects husbands' preferences, it is widely practiced as it satisfies user requirements and simplifies womens' lives. The results of this study are discussed in a broader historical and cultural context and used to provide insight into how Turkey's family planning and reproductive health programs might be improved. In contrast to neighboring countries, there is little sign of withdrawal being displaced in Turkey anytime soon by modern methods.

40|$|Objectives The {{determinants}} {{of the use}} of withdrawal in Turkey are examined using a multinomial logistic model. Methods Data were drawn from a nation-wide population-based cross-sectional study, the Turkish Demographic Health Surveys that took place in 1998 and 2003. Detailed interviews were conducted with 8576 women aged 15 - 49 and analysed using SPSS. Results Contextual, cultural and demographic characteristics define women's choice of withdrawal over modern methods. Socio-economic status, education, employment status, and past fertility behaviour are among key determinants. First-ever used contraception method has a very strong impact on later choices. Urban women, the more educated, those with better socioeconomic status, and those living in less crowded households resort less to withdrawal. Experience and empowerment positively linked to modern contraceptive use among women in Turkey. Conclusions The use of contraceptive methods in Turkey differs greatly. Empowerment of women in terms of better socioeconomic status, better education, modern and liberal attitudes towards women and family planning seem to reduce <b>withdrawal</b> <b>use</b> as the main method of contraception. The results suggest the need for education (particularly targeting young women and couples), information and provision of modern contraceptive services particularly for disadvantaged groups...|$|E
40|$|The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality. Despite its ubiquity, {{withdrawal}} is understudied as {{a family}} planning method. We investigated the context of and decision making around <b>withdrawal</b> <b>use,</b> drawing on in-depth, qualitative interviews with 38 Black and Latina women (ages 18 to 24). We examined contraceptive use histories to understand when and why participants used withdrawal. The majority of participants (n = 29; 76 %) had used withdrawal in their lifetimes, though two-thirds of users mentioned withdrawal in their contraceptive histories only after interviewer prompts. Withdrawal was primarily used during transitions between contraceptive methods and when other methods were not desired. Relationship context was also an important factor, as many used withdrawal to increase intimacy with their partners; because they felt condoms were no longer necessary due to monogamy; or to fulfill their partners preferences to increase sexual pleasure. Our findings indicate that decision making around withdrawal is embedded in situational and relational contexts. Future research should explore how health care providers and sex educators can engage young women in discussions of withdrawals benefits and constraints. A harm reduction framework, which recognizes that optimal use of withdrawal is preferable to not using a pregnancy prevention method at all, may inform the ways that withdrawal can be addressed in clinical and educational settings...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to explore {{withdrawal}} users' experiences of and attitudes to contraceptive methods in Tehran, Iran. Methods This was a cross-sectional study. A sample of women attending a health care center in Tehran, Iran was entered into the study. To collect data structured interviews were conducted. Results In all 300 women who were using withdrawal took part in the study. Of these, 210 women (70 %) indicated that they were used modern contraceptive methods previously. The mean duration for <b>withdrawal</b> <b>use</b> was 6. 5 (SD = 4. 9) and for modern contraceptive it was 2. 3 (SD = 2. 9) years. The most common reasons for using withdrawal were: no cost involvement, did not need medical advice, having fewer side effects and easier to use than other methods. The main obstacles to use modern contraceptives were: health concerns, fear of side effects, misinformation, lack of confidence and sexual dissatisfaction. Conclusion The study results suggest that withdrawal users carry misconceptions about modern contraception and exaggerate its related health problems. Indeed these are important issues for the understanding of attitudes and experiences of women in Iran. The findings from this study might be essential for making evidence-based policy decisions, and for planning, monitoring and evaluating reproductive health programs in Iran and elsewhere. </p...|$|E
30|$|Freshwater {{resources}} are continually decreasing in quality and quantity. Approximately, 1 % of this freshwater is accessible in lakes, river channels and underground for domestic use. The study reviewed literature on water resources with focus on freshwater, {{the quality of}} our freshwater in terms of physical, chemical and biological variables, the main mechanisms of management, and the challenges associated with these mechanisms as well as blending integrated water management with the indigenous or traditional management of water resources for sustainable development and peaceful co-existence. Also the review offered potent recommendations for policy makers to consider sustainable management of freshwater resources. A total of 95 articles were downloaded from Google scholar in water-related issues. The search took place from June to September 2017, and research articles from 1998 to 2018 were reviewed. Basically Ghana is made up of three discharge or outlet systems, namely the Coastal River Systems which is the least and Volta constituting the largest and with the South-Western been the intermediate. Also, freshwater resources usage can be put into two main categories, namely ex situ (<b>withdrawal</b> <b>use)</b> and in situ or in-stream use, and could also be referred to as the consumptive and non-consumptive use, respectively. With the exception of localised pollution engineered by illegal mining and other nuisance perpetuated by indigenes, the quality of water (surface and groundwater) in Ghana is generally better. The review outlined high microbial contamination of water as almost all surface waters are contaminated with either E. coli, faecal coliforms or total coliforms or all. However, these contaminations were more prevalent in surface water than groundwater.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background End-of-life {{policies}} are hotly debated in many countries, with international evidence frequently {{used to support}} or oppose legal reforms. Existing reviews are limited by their focus on specific practices or selected jurisdictions. The objective is to review international time trends in end-of-life practices. Methods We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies on medical end-of-life practices, including treatment withdrawal, {{the use of drugs}} for symptom management, and the intentional use of lethal drugs. A search strategy was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Sociological Abstracts, PAIS International, Worldwide Political Science Abstracts, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences and CINAHL. We included studies that described physicians’ actual practices and estimated annual frequency at the jurisdictional level. End-of-life practice frequencies were analyzed for variations over time, using logit regression. Results Among 8183 references, 39 jurisdiction-wide surveys conducted between 1990 and 2010 were identified. Of those, 22 surveys used sufficiently similar research methods to allow further statistical analysis. Significant differences were found across surveys in the frequency of treatment <b>withdrawal,</b> <b>use</b> of opiates or sedatives and the intentional use of lethal drugs (X 2 [*]>[*] 1000, p[*]<[*] 0. 001 for all). Regression analyses showed increased use of opiates and sedatives over time (p[*]<[*] 0. 001), which could reflect more intense symptom management at the end of life, or increase in these drugs to intentionally cause patients’ death. Conclusion The use of opiates and sedatives appears to have significantly increased over time between 1990 and 2010. Better distinction between practices with different legal status is required to properly interpret the policy significance of these changes. Research on the effects of public policies should take a comprehensive look at trends in end-of-life practice patterns and their associations with policy changes...|$|E

40|$|Neuronal {{apoptosis}} plays {{a critical}} role in development and disease. Developing sympathetic neurons require nerve growth factor (NGF) for their survival and die by apoptosis in its absence. Studies with sympathetic neurons have provided important insights into the molecular mechanisms of neuronal apoptosis and the signalling pathways that regulate the cell death programme in neurons. Bim is a BH 3 -only member of the Bcl- 2 family that increases in level after NGF withdrawal and which is required for NGF withdrawal-induced death. Regulation of bim expression is complex and remains incompletely understood. By analysing the DNA sequence of the rat bim promoter I identified a conserved inverted CCAAT box (ICB) that is bound by the heterotrimeric transcription factor NF-Y in vitro and in chromatin. Interestingly, mutational analysis revealed that the ICB is critical for the induction of a bim-LUC reporter construct following NGF <b>withdrawal.</b> <b>Use</b> of a well-characterised dominant negative NF-YA mutant (YA 13 m 29) showed that NF-Y is required for bim promoter activity and its induction following NGF withdrawal. Overexpression of YA 13 m 29 also demonstrated that NF-Y activity is essential for the expression of the endogenous Bim protein and that NF-Y is important for apoptosis following NGF withdrawal. Furthermore, I found that the transcriptional coactivators CBP/p 300 are required for the activation of bim-LUC following NGF withdrawal and that CBP/p 300 may interact with NF-Y to enhance bim transcription. In addition to this, the prosurvival MEK/ERK pathway has been found to inhibit bim expression independently of the PI 3 -K/Akt pathway. 3 ' RACE and experiments in sympathetic neurons with a new bim-LUC+ 3 'UTR reporter construct revealed that this negative regulation is mediated through the bim 3 ' UTR. Mutational analysis and RNA stability experiments have been employed to further investigate this mechanism...|$|E
40|$|During {{development}} of the peripheral nervous system, sensory axons extend to the periphery in excess where they compete for limiting target-derived neurotrophic support. Local neurotrophin insufficiency triggers axon degeneration, resulting in the pruning of over half of all sensory axons during development. Although axon degeneration facilitates the essential sculpting of the developing nervous system, its improper activation may underlie several neurodegenerative disorders. This process can be modeled in vitro by culturing sensory neurons from mouse dorsal root ganglia {{in the presence of}} nerve growth factor either as explant cultures or in compartmented chambers that allow independent manipulation of cell bodies and axons. The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and the effector caspases, Caspase- 3 and Caspase- 6, mediate axon degeneration in both this in vitro model system and in vivo, clearly indicating a role for classical apoptotic machinery in axon degeneration. However, the full mechanism executing this process has yet to be determined. Previous studies proposed a model whereby the signaling mechanisms that driving axon degeneration in response to local deprivation resides completely within the axon itself. This view has been challenged by results showing that transcriptional inhibition prevents caspase activation in axons, as does physically separating the axon from its cell body. We used the in vitro culture system described above to address this controversy and conclusively show that, although the apoptotic machinery is present in axons, the cell body is required for gating axonal caspase activation and axon degeneration in response to trophic factor <b>withdrawal.</b> <b>Use</b> of selective pharmacological inhibitors and knockdown of candidate genes identifies a pathway whereby local trophic deprivation results in loss of Akt signaling and activation of DLK signaling, leading to activation of the JNK/c-jun signaling and a Foxo 3 a dependent transcriptional program. The cell body acts as a convergence point for these two pathways resulting in upregulation of the proapoptotic protein Puma, itself identified through a genetic knockout screen. We further show that although Puma is unexpectedly confined to the cell body, rising levels of somatic Puma in response to trophic deprivation overcome inhibition by pro-survival Bcl-xL and Bcl-w to initiate an anterograde, JNK-dependent, prodegenerative program. Taken together, our results identify the cell body as a key arbiter of large-scale axon removal...|$|E
