If you tilt the crystal, the spider moves toward {{the edges of the}} oval as though it is trying to get out. For example, in this image the spider's 100 intersection has moved to {{the right side of the}} ellipse as the specimen was tilted to the left.|$|E
5000|$|Tools {{to detect}} {{oil and gas}} have been {{evolving}} for over a century. The simplest and most direct tool is well cuttings examination. Some older oilmen ground the cuttings between their teeth and tasted to see if crude oil was present. Today, a wellsite geologist or mudlogger uses a low powered stereoscopic microscope to determine the lithology of the formation being drilled and to estimate porosity and possible oil staining. A portable ultraviolet light chamber or [...] "Spook Box" [...] is {{used to examine the}} cuttings for fluorescence. Fluorescence can be an indication of crude oil staining, or of the presence of fluorescent minerals. They can be differentiated by placing the cuttings in a solvent filled <b>watchglass</b> or dimple dish. The solvent is usually carbon tetrachlorethane. Crude oil dissolves and then redeposits as a fluorescent ring when the solvent evaporates. The written strip chart recording of these examinations is called a sample log or mudlog.|$|E
30|$|FT-IR spectra were {{recorded}} using a Tensor 29 infrared spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) using the ATR method. In {{the case of}} solid samples (AgNO 3 and PVP), directly, the chemicals were analyzed. In the case of liquid solutions (ORE) or suspensions (Ag/ORE, Ag/ORE/PVP), few drops were transferred onto a <b>watchglass</b> and dried at 70  °C prior to measurement. Then, the dry substance was scratched from the <b>watchglass</b> and the resulting powder was analyzed.|$|E
40|$|The phrase “fringe {{visibility}} map ” here refers to high-resolution images of uniform-thickness single crystal foils showing locally hemispheric deformation (i. e. bent {{into the shape}} of a <b>watchglass),</b> and to various mathematical analogs thereof. As the availability of “diffraction information ” in direct-space form increases, for example with the availability of HREM and z-contrast lattice images, fringe {{visibility map}}s may serve as the direct space analog to Kikuchi maps, i. e. to diffraction pattern maps of Kikuchi line pairs as a function of specimen orientation, and their various cartoonifications. Figures 1 to 3 are schematic Mathematica-generated fringe visibility maps for face-centered, body-centered, and diamond face-centered cubic lattices, respectively. Here we have turned the “locally hemispheric ” concept around and drawn fringes visible when one is viewing a spherical particle of the appropriate thickness, along varying beam directions (rather than lattice orientations) parallel to the local radius vector on that sphere. As you can see, the global structure of these maps is identical to that of Kikuchi maps. In other words, the lattice fringes cross at zone axes which are identical to those orientations in reciprocal space at which Kikuchi lines cross. Hence the information on how far one has to tilt to go from one zone to the next is identical for both types of map. The similarities end there, however, because the widths of the bands (and of the fringes within) is proportional to the lattice spacing. In the reciprocal space case, of course, the width of Kikuchi bands is proportional to the Bragg angle and hence (to first order) inversely proportional to the lattice spacing. Unlike Kikuchi maps, the width of the visibility bands (but not the lattice fringe spacings themselves) depends on the thickness of the specimen. As shown in Figure 1, the visibility of fringes is also quite sensitive to microscope contrast transfer as well. So far, we have found these maps useful for the following purposes 1 - 2...|$|E
40|$|An atomic {{absorption}} spectrophotometric method is described for estimating {{gold in the}} urine of patients undergoing chelation therapy. Variable absorption at 242. 8 nm, not due to gold, is avoided by wet-ashing and extraction of gold into methyl isobutyl ketone. Additional Keyphrase: monitoring chrysotherapy The gold toxicity occasionally encountered during the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis by chrysotherapy may be conveniently treated with chelating agents to facilitate the urinary excretion of gold. It is of interest to monitor this urinary gold excretion, {{atomic absorption}} spectrosco-py being a convenient technique. Although serum gold concentrations may be estimated after simple dilution (1), when the matrix effect caused by proteins may be com-pensated for {{by the addition of}} protein to the standards, urinary gold estimation does not allow such a simple solu-tion because of variable molecular absorption. Materials and Methods Reagents, the atomic absorption spectrometer, its re-corder output, adjustment and operation have been pre-viously described (1). Analytical reagent grade chemicals were used. “Antifoam B ” was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo. 63118. Primary gold standards were prepared as previously de-scribed (1). Method After the addition of a carborundum chip and four drops of Antifoam B (1 ml/ 100 ml), 25 ml of urine was evaporated just to dryness in a 50 -ml beaker covered with a <b>watchglass,</b> by simmering on a hot plate. Five milliliters of acid digestion mixture (equal parts of nitric and per-chloric acids) were added. The covered beakers were placed on a cold hot plate for digestion, and the tempera-ture was increased gradually, being held constant during any frothing, until the nitric acid was gently boiled off. A final increase in temperature was necessary to gently boil off the perchioric acid, just to dryness. The residue was leached quantitatively with several small portions (about 20 ml in all) of hydrochloric acid (3 mol/liter) into 150 mm x 25 mm screw-capped Kimax tubes. The gold was extracted directly into 5 ml of methyl isobutyl ketone (2, 3). Standards and reagent blanks, similarly treated, were used {{for the construction of a}} calibration graph from which specimens were evaluated...|$|E
