5|$|Anderssen <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>successful</b> in European tournaments from 1851 {{to early}} 1878, taking first prize in {{over half of}} the events in which he played. His only {{recorded}} tournament failures were a one-game-per-round knock-out event in 1857 and sixth place at Paris 1878 when his health was failing and he had only about a year to live. His match record was much weaker: out of the 12 that he played, he won only two, drew four and lost six.|$|E

5|$|In 1971 Peter Bogdanovich, {{with whom}} Fields {{had worked on}} Targets, {{recruited}} her to edit What's Up, Doc? (1972); Bogdanovich had edited his previous films himself. The film <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>successful,</b> and is now considered as the second of Bogdanovich's 'golden period' that commenced with The Last Picture Show (1971). What's Up, Doc? established Fields as an editor on studio films. She subsequently edited Bogdanovich's final golden period film, Paper Moon (1973), {{as well as his}} less successful film Daisy Miller (1974).|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Bally Midway {{released}} a pinball {{version of the}} game. However, few elements from the original game are included, and the aliens instead resemble the xenomorphs from the film Alien; Bally Midway was later sued over the game's resemblance to designs by H. R. Giger. Different ports have been met with mixed receptions; the Atari 2600 version <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>successful</b> while the Nintendo Entertainment System version was poorly received.|$|E

Porter visited {{the set of the}} film, met other Dirty Dancing fanatics, and learned the last dance, which she performed {{at the end of the}} documentary in front of family and friends.|$|E
5|$|As a preacher, he {{was rather}} eccentric. He {{was not very}} fluent and gifted as a speaker, but had the power of {{engaging}} the attention of his hearers, and <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>successful</b> and useful in a revival of religion. He entertained rather singular views {{on the subject of}} the orders in the ministry, objecting to the order of deacons, and holding that the eldership is the only true order. In consequence of these peculiar views, he would never consent to be ordained a deacon, and therefore never entered into orders at all.|$|E
5|$|Crazy Taxi is {{a series}} of score attack racing video games that was {{developed}} by Hitmaker and published by Sega.

It is the third best-selling Dreamcast game in the United States, selling over a million copies. The game was later ported to the PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, and PC with sequels also appearing on the Xbox, Game Boy Advance, and PlayStation Portable systems.|$|E

A romantic road-trip film, {{featuring}} a blockbuster album by Yuvan Shankar Raja, it <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>successful.</b> For the first time, he enacted a character {{that lives in}} an urban area. He said that he accepted the film because he desperately wanted to play a cool dude on screen. Karthi's performances in Aayirathil Oruvan and Paiyaa earned him further nominations at the 58th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Actor category. Both films were dubbed into Telugu as Yuganiki Okkadu and Aawara, respectively, and were successful.|$|E
5|$|Kim Deal's {{band the}} Breeders {{released}} Last Splash in August 1993; the album <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>successful,</b> and its release {{was followed by}} much touring. The Breeders then took an extended break from activity. One reason was that Deal's sister Kelley, who {{was also in the}} group, was arrested on drug charges in November 1994. Member Josephine Wiggs likewise took time away from the band, although Wiggs and Deal have different memories of the circumstances surrounding this. Wiggs recalls offering to be involved if Deal's next album {{was going to be a}} Breeders record, but having the impression that Deal wanted to do a solo release; Deal remembers Wiggs declining to be part of any immediate Breeders' recording, but offering to be on the one after that.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{was born}} in Yong Choon county, Fujian province, in China. He joined his father in Negri Sembilan in his youth, before moving to Singapore to set up his own {{property}} business. He <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>successful,</b> and achieved positions of leadership in the local Chinese community. He was widely {{known as one of}} the co-founders of the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), and was its acting chairman during the Japanese Occupation. As one of the early Buddhist pioneers, Lee was also involved in the foundation of the Buddhist Publications Circulation Centre in 1933, and the Singapore Buddhist Lodge in 1934.|$|E

5|$|Manuel <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>successful</b> in {{expanding}} his influence, particularly over the Crusader states. As an example, {{he participated in}} the building and decorating {{of many of the}} basilicas and Greek monasteries in the Holy Land, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem where due to his efforts the Byzantine clergy were allowed to perform the Greek liturgy each day. All this reinforced his position as overlord of the Crusader states, with his hegemony over Antioch and Jerusalem secured by agreement with Raynald, Prince of Antioch, and Amalric, King of Jerusalem. This success in gaining influence and allies among the western states and the Pope is regarded one of the most impressive achievements of Manuel Komnenos's reign.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{was born}} in Australia {{and grew up in}} England from the age of six. After playing cricket for Eton College, he went to Cambridge University where he {{established}} a reputation as a fast bowler, albeit one who was often injured. After leaving university, Allen played mainly for Middlesex. He improved as a batsman in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly. A change of career allowed him to play more cricket, and by the late 1920s he {{was on the verge of}} the England Test team. He made his debut in 1930, and remained in contention for a place, when he was available to play, for the rest of the decade. During the controversial Bodyline tour of 1932–33, Allen <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>successful</b> for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his teammates.|$|E
5|$|BioWare {{produced}} Neverwinter Nights (2002) for Atari, {{the first}} CRPG to fuse the third-edition Dungeons & Dragons rules with a 3D display {{in which the}} user could vary the viewing angle and distance. New game content could be generated using the Aurora toolset supplied {{as part of the}} game release, and players could share their modules and play cooperatively with friends online. Based in part on experiences while playing Ultima Online, one of the goals during development was to reproduce the feel of a live pen-and-paper RPG experience, complete with a human Dungeon Master. Neverwinter Nights (NWN) <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>successful</b> commercially, and spawned three official expansion packs and a sequel developed by Obsidian Entertainment. BioWare later produced the acclaimed , which married the d20 system with the Star Wars franchise; as well as the original Jade Empire (2005), Mass Effect (20072012) and Dragon Age (20092014) series, all which were released for multiple platforms. With the Mass Effect and the Dragon Age titles, Bioware also utilized a save import system where decisions in the earlier games impact the story in the later games.|$|E

5|$|D'Oliveira {{was aware}} of the {{political}} discussions surrounding him during 1968, and the pressure on him was intensified by the scrutiny of his supporters and opponents in England and South Africa. Conscious of his failure in the West Indies, he made a concerted effort to improve his batting. He scored runs consistently and was chosen for England's first Test of 1968, against Australia in early June. He <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>successful,</b> scoring 87 not out and taking two wickets. After England lost, however, D'Oliveira was blamed in some sections of the press. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that he failed as a bowler, and his innings was difficult to evaluate as England had effectively lost the match by that stage. Even so, most observers expected him to retain his place, including the watching South Africans.|$|E
5|$|The Ilyushin Il-40 (NATO {{reporting}} name: Brawny) was a two-seat Soviet jet-engined armored ground-attack aircraft. The first prototype flew in 1953 and <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>successful</b> {{except when}} it fired its guns, as their combustion gasses disturbed the airflow into the engines and caused them to flameout or hiccup. Remedying this problem took over a year and involved the radical change of moving the engine air intakes {{all the way to}} the very front of the aircraft and repositioning the guns from the tip of the nose to the bottom of the fuselage, just behind the nosewheel. The aircraft, now resembling a double-barreled shotgun from the front, was ordered into production in 1955. Only five production aircraft had been completed before the entire program was canceled in early 1956 when the VVS discarded its close air-support doctrine in favor of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|The New Kingdom pharaohs began a {{large-scale}} building {{campaign to promote}} the god Amun, whose growing cult was based in Karnak. They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements, both real and imagined. The Karnak temple is the largest Egyptian temple ever built. The pharaoh Hatshepsut used such hyperbole and grandeur during her reign of almost twenty-two years. Her reign <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>successful,</b> marked by {{an extended period of}} peace and wealth-building, trading expeditions to Punt, restoration of foreign trade networks, and great building projects, including an elegant mortuary temple that rivaled the Greek architecture of a thousand years later, a colossal pair of obelisks, and a chapel at Karnak. Despite her achievements, Amenhotep II, the heir to Hatshepsut's nephew-stepson Tuthmosis III, sought to erase her legacy {{near the end of his}} father's reign and throughout his, touting many of her accomplishments as his. He also tried to change many established traditions that had developed over the centuries, which some suggest was a futile attempt to prevent other women from becoming pharaoh and to curb their influence in the kingdom.|$|E
