25|$|In the {{new version}} from the December 21 interview, Mangum claims she was {{attacked}} from 11:35p.m. to midnight, much earlier than her previous accusations. This new timing is before the well-documented alibi evidence for Reade Seligmann that places {{him away from the}} house. However, the defense revealed that this new timing would suggest Seligmann <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>with</b> his girlfriend {{during the height of the}} attack. Additionally, she received an incoming call at 11:36p.m. and somebody stayed on the line for 3 minutes, which would be during the party according to the new timetable.|$|E

My people are out there fighting for their lives and my freedom. I have to go help them", and hung up the phone. Black parents and adults who were observing cheered the marching students, but when the hoses were turned on, bystanders began to throw rocks and bottles at the police. [...] To disperse them, Connor ordered police to use German shepherd dogs to keep them in line. James Bevel wove in and out of the crowds warning them, [...] "If any cops get hurt, we're going to lose this fight." [...] At 3p.m., the protest was over. [...] During a kind of truce, protesters went home. Police removed the barricades and re-opened the streets to traffic. That evening King told worried parents in a crowd of a thousand, [...] "Don't worry about your children who are in jail. The eyes of the world are on Birmingham. We're going on in spite of dogs and fire hoses. We've gone too far to turn back." ...|$|E

[...] "During the height of all of these developments, when I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>with</b> senior Georgian officials, they sure sounded completely convinced that Russian armored vehicles had entered the Roki Tunnel, and exited the Roki Tunnel, before and during the cease-fire," [...] he stated.
