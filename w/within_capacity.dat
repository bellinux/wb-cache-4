40|$|Motivation and idea. Distributed {{applications}} in use today, such as monitoring systems (e. g. Ganglia), data-parallel processing frameworks (e. g. Hadoop) and replicated databases (e. g.

Cluster applications often assume that the network is well-provisioned and its usage is effectively free, {{as long as it}} remains <b>within</b> <b>capacity</b> bounds. As cluster applications are deployed in cloud envi-ronments, or even across multiple data centre sites, these assumptions no longer hold: cloud tenants would like to control the network usage of distributed clus-ter applications, e. g. to minimise their costs.

40|$|A PDP {{model of}} human analogical {{reasoning}} is presented {{which is designed}} to incorporate psychologically realistic processing capacity limitations. Capacity is defined in terms of the complexity of relations that can be processed in parallel. Relations are represented in the model by computing the tensor product of vectors representing predicates and arguments. Relations in base and target are superimposed. Based on empirical evidence of capacity limitations, the model is limited to processing one quaternary relation in parallel (rank 5 tensor product). More complex relations are processed by conceptual chunking (recoding to fewer arguments, but with loss of access to some relations) or segmentation (processing components of the structure serially). The model processes complex analogies, such as heat flow-water flow, and atom-solar system, while remaining <b>within</b> <b>capacity</b> limitations.

40|$|The {{need for}} better and more {{accurate}} assessments of testamentary and decision-making capacity grows as Australian society ages and incidences of mentally disabling conditions increase. Capacity is a legal determination, but one on which medical opinion is increasingly being sought. The difficulties inherent <b>within</b> <b>capacity</b> assessments are exacerbated by the ad hoc approaches adopted by legal and medical professionals based on individual knowledge and skill, {{as well as the}} numerous assessment paradigms that exist. This can negatively affect the quality of assessments, and results in confusion as to the best way to assess capacity. This article begins by assessing the nature of capacity. The most common general assessment models used in Australia are then discussed, as are the practical challenges associated with capacity assessment. The article concludes by suggesting a way forward to satisfactorily assess legal capacity given the significant ramifications of getting it wrong...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Occupational {{capacity}} evaluations {{have previously}} {{been subject to}} criticism for lacking in quality and consistency. To the authors' knowledge, {{there is no clear}} consensus on the best way to formally assess functioning <b>within</b> <b>capacity</b> evaluations. In this review we investigated different instruments that are used to assess functioning in occupational capacity evaluations. Methods: Systematic review of the literature. Results: Though several instruments that assess functional capacity were found in our search, a specific validated instrument assessing occupational capacity {{as part of a larger}} psychiatric evaluation was not found. The limitations of the existing instruments on assessing functional capacity are discussed. Conclusion: Medical experts relying on instruments to conduct functional capacity evaluations should be cognizant of their limitations. The findings call for the development and use of an instrument specifically designed to assess the functional and occupational capacity of psychiatric patients, which is also likely to improve the quality of these reports...|$|E

40|$|AbstractLearning real weights for a McCulloch-Pitts neuron is {{equivalent}} to linear programming and can hence be done in polynomial time. Efficient local learning algorithms such as Perceptron Learning further guarantee convergence in finite time. The problem becomes considerably harder, however, when it is sought to learn binary weights; this {{is equivalent}} to integer programming which {{is known to be}} NP-complete. A family of probabilistic algorithms which learn binary weights for a McCulloch-Pitts neuron with inputs constrained to be binary is proposed here, the target functions being majority functions of a set literals. These algorithms have low computational demands and are essentially local in character. Rapid (average-case) quadratic rates of convergence for the algorithm are predicted analytically and confirmed through computer simulations when the number of examples is <b>within</b> <b>capacity.</b> It is also shown that, for the functions under consideration, Preceptron Learning converges rapidly (but to an, in general, non-binary solution weight vector) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to the widespread problem of prison congestion, Connecticut’s Corrections Commissioner, John Manson, has suggested that prison cells be allocated to judges {{so that they would}} assume some responsibility for keeping prison populations <b>within</b> <b>capacity</b> limits. We explore a number of the choices that must be made in implementing this proposal, including the questions of what units to allocate (e. g., cells or cell-years), to whom the allocation should go (courts, individual judges, or prosecutors), what rules for allocation would be proper and equitable, what procedures to follow when an allocation is depleted, how to manage spare cells for emergencies, and what research is needed to implement such a process. The Manson proposal forces a clear recognition of the need {{to deal with the problem}} of finite prison capacity, but the problems it raises warrant consideration of the Michigan "safety valve " or the Minnesota capacity-constrained sentencing guidelines for limiting prison congestion...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} demands for better transmission speed and robust {{quality of service}} (QoS), the capacity constrained backhaul gradually becomes a bottleneck in cooperative wireless networks, e. g., in the Internet of Things (IoT) scenario in joint processing mode of LTE-Advanced Pro. This paper focuses on resource allocation <b>within</b> <b>capacity</b> constrained backhaul in uplink cooperative wireless networks, where two base stations (BSs) equipped with single antennae serve multiple single-antennae users via multi-carrier transmission mode. In this work, we propose a novel cooperative transmission scheme based on compress-and-forward with user pairing to solve the joint mixed integer programming problem. To maximize the system capacity under the limited backhaul, we formulate the joint optimization problem of user sorting, subcarrier mapping and backhaul resource sharing among different pairs (subcarriers for users). A novel robust and efficient centralized algorithm based on alternating optimization strategy and perfect mapping is proposed. Simulations show that our novel method can improve the system capacity significantly under the constraint of the backhaul resource compared with the blind alternatives...|$|E

40|$|Many {{cognitive}} processes depend on {{our ability to}} hold information in mind, often well beyond the offset of the original sensory input. The capacity of this visual short-term memory (VSTM) is limited to around three to four items. Recent {{research has demonstrated that}} the content of VSTM can be modulated by top-down attentional biases. This has been demonstrated using retrodictive spatial cues, termed "retro-cues," which orient subjects' attention to spatial locations within VSTM. In the present article, we tested whether the use of these cues is modulated by memory load and cue delay. There are a number of important conclusions: (1) Top-down biases can operate on very brief iconic traces as well as on older VSTM representations (Exp. 1). (2) When operating <b>within</b> <b>capacity,</b> subjects use the cue to prioritise where they initiate their memory search, rather than to discard uncued items (Exps. 2 and 3). (3) When capacity is exceeded, there is little benefit to top-down biasing relative to a neutral condition; however, unattended items are lost, with there being a substantial cost of invalid spatial cueing (Exp. 3). (4) These costs and benefits of orienting spatial attention differ across iconic memory and VSTM representations when VSTM capacity is exceeded (Exp. 4) ...|$|E

It differs from alternative approaches to this well-known problem by allowing for setup cost indivisibilities. As an approximation, the following linear programming model is suggested: Let an activity be defined as a sequence of the inputs required to satisfy the delivery requirements for a single item over time. The input coefficients for each such activity may then be constructed so as to allow for all setup costs incurred when the activity is operated at the level of unity or at zero. It is then shown that in any solution to this problem, all activity levels will turn out to be either unity or zero, except for those related to a group of items which, in number, must be equal to or less than the original number of capacity constraints. This result means that the linear programming solution should provide a good approximation whenever the number of items being manufactured is large in comparison with the number of capacity constraints. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{developing}} countries like Pakistan, the capacity shortage (CS) of electricity {{is a critical}} problem. The frequent natural gas (NG) outages compel consumers to use electricity to fulfill the thermal loads, which ends up as an increase in electrical load. In this scenario, the authors have proposed {{the concept of a}} combined heat & power (CHP) plant to be a better option for supplying both electrical and thermal loads simultaneously. A CHP plant-based microgrid comprising a PV array, diesel generators and batteries (operating in grid-connected as well as islanded modes) has been simulated using the HOMER Pro software. Different configurations of distributed generators (DGs) with/without batteries have been evaluated considering multiple objectives. The multiple objectives include the minimization of the total net present cost (TNPC), cost of generated energy (COE) and the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as the maximization of annual waste heat recovery (WHR) of thermal units and annual grid sales (GS). These objectives are subject to the constraints of power balance, battery operation within state of charge (SOC) limits, generator operation <b>within</b> <b>capacity</b> limits and zero capacity shortage. The simulations have been performed on six cities including Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, Quetta and Gilgit. The simulation results have been analyzed to find the most optimal city for the CHP plant integrated microgrid...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences, 2011 Yosemite National Park uses a trailhead {{quota system}} to manage {{wilderness}} visitors. Park scientists set user carrying capacities in the 1970 s for backcountry zones and trailhead quotas from prevalent travel patterns {{and a computer}} simulation model. Limiting how many visitors start daily at a trailhead maintains overnight zone use <b>within</b> <b>capacity</b> if trip characteristics (party size, trip duration, spatiotemporal itinerary adherence) remain similar to the 1970 s. Evidence suggests that travel patterns have changed since this system???s inception. Data on which the original trailhead quotas were based, and the data on itinerary adherence, are nearly forty years old, and the supposition is that visitor use consists of {{a larger number of}} shorter-duration trips. Consequently, travel zone capacities are being exceeded in some zones on many high-use nights. To accurately assess wilderness use and itinerary deviation to develop a contemporary travel simulation model, wilderness trips from 1 May through 30 September 2010 were evaluated in regard to mean party size, trip duration; and spatial and temporal itinerary adherence. Strong evidence of visitor spatiotemporal itinerary deviation was found. Travel patterns suggest more concentrated use of frontcountry adjacent areas, and increased visitor attraction to iconic peaks and service facilities. Multiple visitor use scenarios were simulated and resultant use presented to inform resource managers. Yosemite Conservanc...|$|E
40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{integration of}} variable renewable energies (VRE) like Photovoltaics and wind power into the power system {{is crucial for}} the transition towards a sustainable electricity supply. However, due to the inherent characteristics of VRE, i. e. the site-specific, highly variable, and unreliable power generation, {{as well as their}} low variable generation costs, the large-scale deployment of VRE causes adequacy-, grid-related, and balancing-impacts for the residual system. These impacts and the related costs need to be considered for a concerted capacity expansion planning with VRE in order to identify cost-efficient and reliable transition pathways. Traditionally applied capacity expansion planning models have limitations to consider the value of energy at its time of the delivery of VRE and their impacts on the system due to the applied low system-operational detail. Hence, new planning methods are required to ensure a successful transition towards a sustainable electricity supply. This work enhances the REMix energy system modelling framework to allow for a concerted long-term capacity expansion planning with VRE. The outcome of this is the REMix-Capacity Expansion Model (REMix-CEM). The optimization model bridges the gap between traditional long-term capacity expansion planning and short-term power system operation models. This enables the model to consider the value and the impacts of a large-scale integration of VRE into the power system accurately <b>within</b> <b>capacity</b> expansion planning. This thesis describes the challenges of long-term capacity expansion planning with VRE and presents the developed model in detail. This includes a principle description of how REMix-CEM is typically applied by DLR for a science-based consultancy of planning authorities in developing and emerging countries. To demonstrate its capabilities, the flexible formulation of the model is used to investigate two important issues within a model-based long-term capacity expansion planning with VRE - the model foresight and the applied system-operational detail. Both issues can have a significant influence on results and computational effort of the model. These correlations are investigated within two case studies for a fictitious but representative power system of a developing country. Results of the first case study indicate that the type of model foresight (single-year myopic, multi-annual rolling horizon, or perfect foresight) has a strong influence when some of the input parameters change suddenly at one point of the planning time frame, while its influence is less pronounced when parameters changes rather continuously over the period of study. Only a large model foresight enables the model to anticipate future occurrences well in advance and to adopt its investment strategies accordingly. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the larger the model foresight the higher is the competitiveness of VRE and dispatchable RE, because their advantage to produce electricity at stable costs over the lifetime can be captured more precisely. However, it is also demonstrated that a larger model foresight means also a higher computational effort to solve the capacity expansion optimization problem. In addition, a large model foresight with perfect information over the planning time frame might not fully capture the decision frame-work of real-life decision makers. To keep computational effort manageable for long-term capacity expansion planning with VRE, investment decisions are typically based on a limited number of representative dispatch periods. These dispatch periods have the aim to represent the temporal variability of load and RE resources over the year as accurate as possible. Within the second case study it is shown that the average day method, which uses average values to assign values for RE resource availability to the utilized dispatch periods, is inappropriate for capacity expansion planning with VRE. The value of energy at its time of the delivery of VRE is modeled inaccurately and system flexibility requirements, caused by the integration of VRE, are underestimated systematically. The representative day method, which uses a sample of “real” historical days instead of average values, is significantly more suitable because extreme values are not averaged. This leads to a better approximation of VRE electricity generation, which allows a more accurate consideration of the value of energy at its time of the delivery of VRE and system flexibility requirements. System flexibility requirements can be captured <b>within</b> <b>capacity</b> expansion optimization especially by considering unit commitment constraints (UCCs) of thermal generators. However, this requires a large number of integer decision variables that describes the unit commitment status. This leads to high computational complexity. Hence, UCCs are typically neglected during capacity expansion optimization. Within the second case study it is however demonstrated that neglecting UCCs <b>within</b> <b>capacity</b> expansion planning with VRE leads to an overestimation of the competitiveness of VRE and an underestimation of the need for flexible generation and storage technologies. This work shows that by a linear relaxation for UCCs system flexibility restrictions can be captured accurately during long-term capacity expansion optimization with comparably low additional computational effort...|$|E

40|$|Capacity {{building}} {{is an essential}} component of any institutional reform such as building land administration infrastructures or spatial data infrastructures (SDI). However the capacity building concept is often used within a narrow meaning such as focusing on staff development through formal education and training programmes to meet the lack of qualified personnel in a project in the short term. This article argues that capacity building measures should be addressed in the wider context of developing and maintaining institutional infrastructures in a sustainable way, even if the key focus may be on education and training to meet short and medium term needs. This article develops the capacity building concept and looks at capacity assessment and capacity development as the two key components. <b>Within</b> <b>capacity</b> development it considers the levels and dimesions of capacity. The paper then introduces the evolving SDI concept and explores how capacity {{building is}} essential in delivering an operational SDI. In order to resolve the difficulty of applying the complex and often unclear nature of capacity building to the evolving and similarly unclear nature of SDI, capacity building for SDI in Australia is used as a case study. The paper also identifies that the SDI concept is less easily transferred to developing countries and as such raises the role of SDIs in developing countries as an important un-answered question for the Permanent Committee on GIS Infrastructure for Asia and the Pacific to consider. 14 - 18 July, 2003 Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Issues addressed: Reorientation of the {{workforce}} in primary {{health care is a}} complex process and requires specific strategies and interventions. Primary health care providers are a key health care workforce that is expected to deliver tangible outcomes from disease prevention and health promotion strategies. This paper describes a training intervention that occurred {{as part of a broader}} participatory action research process for building health promotion capacity in the primary health care workforce. Methods: Participatory action research (PAR) was conducted over six action and reflection cycles in a two-year period (2001 – 02) in an urban community health setting in the Northern Territory. One of the PAR cycles was a training intervention that was identified as a need from a survey in the first action and reflection cycle. This training was facilitated by a health promotion specialist, face-to-face and comprised five 3. 5 -h sessions over a 5 -month period. A pre-post questionnaire was used to measure the knowledge and skills components of the training intervention. Results: The results reinforced the importance of using a participatory approach that involved the primary health care providers themselves. Multiple strategies such as workforce development <b>within</b> <b>capacity</b> building frameworks assisted in shifting work practice more upstream. Additionally, these strategies encouraged more reflective practice and built social capital within the primary health care workforce. Conclusion: Lessons from practice reinforce that workforce development influenced work practice change and is an important element in building the health promotion capacity of primary health care centres. So what? Workforce development is critical for reorienting health services. Health promotion specialists play an important role in reorienting practice, which is only effective when combined with other strategies, and driven and led by the primary health care workforce...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Admission control (call control) is a well-studied online problem. We {{are given}} a xed graph with edge capacities, and must process a {{sequence}} of calls that arrive over time, accepting some and rejecting others {{in order to stay}} <b>within</b> <b>capacity</b> limitations of the network. In the standard theoretical formulation, this problem is analyzed as a bene t problem: the goal is to devise an online algorithm that accepts at least a reasonable fraction of the maximum number of calls that could possibly have been accepted in hindsight. This formulation, however, has the property that even algorithms with optimal competitive ratios (typically O(log n)) may end up rejecting the vast majority of calls even when it would have been possible in hindsight to reject only very few. In this paper, we instead consider the goal of approximately minimizing the number of calls rejected. This is much more natural for real-world settings in which rejections are intended to be rare events. In order to avoid trivial lower-bounds, we assume preemption is allowed and that calls are given to the algorithm as xed paths. We show that in a number of cases, we can in fact achieve a competitive ratio of 2 for rejections (so if the optimal in hindsight rejects 0 then we reject 0; if the optimal rejects r then we reject at most 2 r). For other cases we get worse but nontrivial bounds. For the most general case of xed paths in arbitrary graphs with arbitrary edge capacities, we achieve matching (p m) upper and lower bounds. We also show a connection between these problems and online versions of the vertex-cover and set-cover problems (our factor- 2 results give 2 -approximations to slight generalizations of the vertex cover problem, much as [AAA 99] show hardness results for the bene t version based on the hardness of approximability of independent set). ...|$|E
