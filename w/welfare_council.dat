25|$|However, {{a letter}} {{sent by the}} Farm Animal <b>Welfare</b> <b>Council</b> to {{government}} ministers stated that cow welfare need not be compromised in large dairy units, a message echoed by the RSPCA, which, despite not permitting year-round housing for dairy cows within its Freedom Foods standards, said it didn't believe 'big was necessarily bad' and in fact could offer welfare benefits if implemented correctly. Other debates range around {{the potential for a}} large dairy such as this to improve food security and opportunities to reduce the carbon footprint of milk production through better efficiency and the adoption of technology such as anaerobic digestion. More recently the Government has published its Foresight report on Food and Farming, and the dairy's developers have asserted that their plans would help address the report's conclusions that farming needs to produce more food using fewer resources while tackling climate change.|$|E

Many communities directed laws against the Witnesses and their preaching work. From 1938 to 1955, the organization was involved in over forty cases before the Supreme Court, winning a majority of them. The first important victory came in 1938, when in Lovell v. City of Griffin, the Supreme Court held that cities could not require permits for the distribution of pamphlets. In 1939, the Supreme Court decided Schneider v. Town of Irvington, in which it struck down anti-littering laws that were enforced only against Jehovah's Witnesses who were handing out pamphlets. In 1940, the Court considered Cantwell v. Connecticut; the plaintiff, a Jehovah's Witness, was charged with soliciting donations without a certificate from the Public <b>Welfare</b> <b>Council.</b> The Council was to grant the certificate only if the organization requesting it was a charity or sponsored a religious cause. The Supreme Court ruled that any law granting a public body the function of determining if a cause is religious or not violates the First Amendment.|$|E

Indeed, an historical review of British legislation reveals only minor changes in the expectation that animals should not suffer, once it was recognised that they were more than chattels. The Animal Welfare Act 2006 in England and Wales and similar legislation in Scotland now requires that an animal’s needs are provided. These needs are based on the Farm Animal <b>Welfare</b> <b>Council’s</b> (FAWC’s) ‘Five Freedoms’. These were first promulgated in 1979 and have their origins in the 1965 Brambell inquiry into the welfare of animals kept under intensive livestock husbandry systems.

Tilgangurinn er að veita innsýn í störf ráðanna og draga lærdóm af niðurstöðum en einnig að vekja lesendur til umhugsunar um réttindastöðu grunnskólanemenda. Vaxandi skilningur er á mikilvægi þess að rödd barna fái hljómgrunn, að á þau sé hlustað og að þess sjáist merki við ákvörðunartöku í málum þar sem aðstæður þeirra og vandi eru til meðferðar. Nemendaverndarráð eru þverfagleg teymi sem eiga að starfa í grunnskólum landsins og þeim er ætlað að stuðla að velferð nemenda. Starfsemi þeirra hefur lítt verið rannsökuð og ekki hafa legið fyrir upplýsingar um þátttöku barna í meðferð mála sem tekin eru fyrir þar. Rafrænn spurningalisti var sendur til skólastjóra allra grunnskóla á Íslandi skóla- árið 2013 – 2014. Alls bárust svör frá 84 skólum og var svarhlutfall 50 % á landsvísu. Niðurstöður benda til þess að nemendaverndarráð starfi í flestum grunnskólum og töldu þátttakendur þau almennt starfa með hagsmuni nemenda að leiðarljósi. Mál sem rata inn á borð nemendaverndarráða eiga það flest sameiginlegt að fjalla um málefni einstakra nemenda en hlutdeild nemenda í afgreiðslu mála sem þá snerta er takmörkuð. Þátttakendur töldu aldur og þroska nemenda og eðli mála helstu ástæður lítillar aðkomu nemendanna sjálfra. Meirihluta foreldra (86 %) er tilkynnt að um mál barns þeirra sé fjallað í ráðunum en hlutfallslega fáum börnum er gert við- vart um það (17 %). Niðurstöður benda til að tryggja þurfi betur hlutdeild nemenda í ákvörðunum um eigin málefni í nemendaverndarráðunum. The aim of {{the study}} {{reported}} here was to examine the practice of pupils’ <b>welfare</b> <b>councils</b> in compulsory schools, and participation of children in decision-making in their own educational affairs, which are seen holistically and include health and safety issues. The purpose was to provide insight into the practices of pupils’ <b>welfare</b> <b>councils</b> and to learn from the results as well as to increase awareness of rights of children. There is an increasing understanding of the importance of listening to children, for them be heard and engaged in decision making in their own affairs while planning and managing adequate responses and services. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, as well as laws and regulations regarding pupils´ welfare and the national curriculum´s fundamental pillars focus on democracy and human rights, were used as guidelines when conducting this study. In addition, the perspective of recent childhood studies, where children are looked upon as active and autonomous individuals, was also used as reference. Pupils’ <b>welfare</b> <b>councils</b> (hereafter PWCs) are multidisciplinary teams that are legally mandated to operate in compulsory schools in Iceland and are intended to promote and safeguard children’s and young people’s welfare in schooling. The role of PWCs is to coordinate and manage services for pupils in school health services, school counselling and inclusive education and to assist headmasters in managing plans regarding special assistance for individual pupils as well as promoting preventative measures. Involvement of children and young people in decision making in the PWCs is not statuted in the Compulsory School Act even though they are, according to the Children Act, entitled to express their opinions on all matters regarding them and fair consideration shall be given to their opinions in accordance to their age and maturity. The practice of the PWCs is under researched and no information can be found about the participation of pupils in affairs related to their individual case handling. Quantitative research methods were used in this study. During the school year 2013 – 2014 an electronic questionnaire was sent to all compulsory school principals in Iceland. There were responses from 84 schools, with a response rate of 50 %. Results indicate that there are PWCs in place in most schools and participants felt that they generally operate {{in the best interests of}} students. Most issues that find their way into the PWCs have in common matters concerning individual children, but pupils’ involvement in decision making and handling of matters concerning themselves showed to be limited. The participants mentioned age, maturity of pupils and different nature of affairs as the main reasons for the infrequent involvement of children. Majority of parents (86 %) are notified about the case handlings of their children’s affairs in the councils but only a small percentage of pupils are made aware of it (17 %). In light of other studies of wishes, competence and the mandated rights of children these results indicate the need for more involvement of school children in decisions about their own affairs in pupil <b>welfare</b> <b>councils.</b> Lack of management guidelines concerning the case handlings was found in the participants´ answers when asked about the work of practices and also in the keeping of records and minutes. Results indicate that more emphasis should be on establishing such rules. This would enhance each council’s proceedings during their work. To promote success and effective development of pupil <b>welfare</b> <b>councils</b> it is important to have a thorough knowledge of current activities, and results of this study provide that needed overview...|$|R
5000|$|Also called live chilling, {{this method}} {{involves}} putting fish in baths of ice water, where they chill and eventually die of anoxia. Because chilling slows metabolic rate and oxygen needs, it may prolong the duration until death in some instances, with some cold adapted species taking {{more than an}} hour to die. On these grounds, the Farm Animal <b>Welfare</b> <b>Council's</b> 1996 report on farmed-fish welfare stated: [...] "The cooling of live trout on ice after they have been removed from water should be prohibited." [...] In contrast, later research suggested that for warm Mediterranean species such as sea bream and sea bass, the method might at least be preferable to air asphyxiation, with fish showing lower levels of stress indicators. [...] More recent research has shown that ice water is faster and less stressful than anaesthetics for killing tropical ornamental fishes like zebrafish.|$|R

Compassion in World Farming also supported the recommendation saying [...] "We believe that the law must be changed to require all animals to be stunned before slaughter."

2500|$|In recent years, the aim {{has been}} to develop more {{permanent}} beak trimming (although repeat trimming may be required), using [...] electrically heated blades in a beak trimming machine, to provide a self-cauterizing cut. [...] There are currently (2012) four widely used methods of beak trimming: hot blade, cold blade (including scissors or secateurs), electrical (the Bio-beaker) and infrared. [...] The latter two methods usually remove {{only the tip of}} the beak and do not leave an open wound, therefore they may offer improvements in welfare. Other approaches {{such as the use of}} lasers, freeze drying and chemical retardation have been investigated but are not in widespread use. [...] The infrared method directs a strong source of heat into the inner tissue of the beak and after a few weeks, the tip of the upper and lower beak dies and drops off making the beak shorter with blunt tips. [...] The Bio-beaker, which uses an electric current to burn a small hole in the upper beak, is the preferred method for trimming the beaks of turkeys. [...] The Farm Animal <b>Welfare</b> <b>Council</b> (FAWC) wrote regarding beak trimming of turkeys that cold cutting was the most accurate method, but that substantial re-growth of the beak occurred; although the Bio-beaker limited beak re-growth, it was less accurate. [...] It was considered that the hot cut was the most distressing procedure for turkeys.|$|E
