In 2012, Krish speaks to Meera and Radha one more time, severing ties with Meera and confessing his true love to Radha. In 1910, Javed and Aradhana vow that their love <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> last this lifetime but for all lifetimes to come.|$|E
5|$|In London, {{astrophysicist}} Dr. Jane Foster and her intern Darcy Lewis {{travel to}} an abandoned factory where such portals have appeared, disrupting {{the laws of}} physics around them. Separating from the group, Jane is teleported to another world, where she is infected by the Aether. Heimdall alerts Thor that Jane has moved beyond his near all-seeing vision, leading Thor to Earth. When Thor finds Jane, she inadvertently releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. Odin, recognizing the Aether, warns that the Aether <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> kill Jane, but that its return heralds a catastrophic prophecy.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine was the world's first {{publicly}} funded college of osteopathic medicine. It has a long-standing tradition of retaining its alumni in Michigan to practice – {{more than two-thirds}} of the college's graduates remain to practice in Michigan. In 2008, the Michigan State University Board of Trustees approved a resolution endorsing the expansion of the College of Osteopathic Medicine to two sites in southeast Michigan, a move board members and college officials say <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> improve medical education in the state, but also address a projected physician shortage.|$|E
5|$|Tillman had met, in 1886, with Thomas G. Clemson, {{son-in-law}} of {{the late}} John C. Calhoun, to discuss a bequest to underwrite {{the cost of the}} new agricultural school. Clemson died in 1888, and his <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> left money and land for the college, but made Tillman one of seven trustees for life, who had the power to appoint their successors. Tillman stated that this provision, which made the lifetime trustees a majority of the board, was intended to forestall any attempt by a future Republican government to admit African Americans. Clemson College (later Clemson University) was authorized by the legislature in December 1888.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{cooperative}} breeders, {{with parental}} care being {{shared by all}} community members. For example, mothers will stash their offspring with other mothers or leave them to be guarded by other community members, including non-breeding individuals of both genders. While the mother is away, community members <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> care for and guard them, but also sound alarm calls if danger is detected or if leaving the infant alone. They will also respond to alarm calls by others. These coordinated vigilance displays further involve communal transmission of the alarm call, with nearby community members repeating the alarm call, potentially summoning the mother back to her offspring. Infant transport by {{other members of the}} community has also been recorded. Females have been observed nursing infants of their close relatives, while close kin have adopted rejected infants, acting as foster parents.|$|E

25|$|Many local chevra kadishas {{in urban}} areas are {{affiliated}} with local synagogues, and they often own their own burial plots in various local cemeteries. Some Jews pay an annual token membership fee to the chevra kadisha of their choice, {{so that when the}} time comes, the society <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> attend to the body of the deceased as befits Jewish law, but will also ensure burial in a plot that it controls at an appropriate nearby Jewish cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Cleaning is an {{important}} part of caring for tack. Tack that is not cleaned will start to build up sweat and dirt, which will cause uncomfortable rubbing on the horse. Sweat and dirt also tend to cause cracking in leather, which may result in breaking. This not only decreases the value of the saddle, but can be very dangerous if critical equipment, such as a stirrup leather, breaks mid-ride. Proper care and conditioning of the saddle <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> increase its useful life, but will also help to retain its value.|$|E
25|$|Conservation – As {{with the}} {{intraspecific}} relationship, the interspecific O–A relationship implies that species <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> {{be at risk}} of extinction due to low abundance, but because species with low abundance {{are expected to have}} restricted distributions, they are at risk of local catastrophe leading to global extinction. This may be confounded by the difficulty in surveying locally rare species due to both their low detectability, and restricted distribution (see above). Finally, because rare species are expected to have restricted distributions, conservation programmes aimed at prioritizing sites for multi-species conservation will include fewer habitats for rare species than common species.|$|E

25|$|The {{city has}} also {{invested}} heavily in infrastructure to attract investment.

Furthermore, the nearby Three Gorges Dam which is the world's largest, <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> supply Chongqing with power once completed but also allows oceangoing ships to reach Chongqing's Yangtze River port. These infrastructure improvements have led to the arrivals of numerous foreign direct investors (FDI) in industries ranging from car to finance and retailing; such as Ford, Mazda, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, ANZ Bank, Scotiabank, Wal-Mart, Metro AG and Carrefour, among other multinational corporations.|$|E

Relevant water resource management objectives include: 1) Reinforce the national sector actors {{to fulfill their}} new roles as a necessity for successful decentralization of the services; and 2) Reduce non-revenue water in selected areas of Tegucigalpa to provide immediate impact on the service quality. Jane Armitage, World Bank Director for Central America, says,"The Water and Sanitation Sector Modernization Project <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> enable an environment that develops and strengthens service providers, but also will foster transparency and improve their effectiveness in the water sector".|$|E

25|$|If {{there is}} a {{suspicion}} of cancer, biopsy is performed, usually under general anaesthetic. This provides histological proof of cancer type and grade. If the lesion appears to be small and well localised, the surgeon may undertake excision biopsy, where an attempt is made to completely remove the tumour {{at the time of}} first biopsy. In this situation, the pathologist <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> be able to confirm the diagnosis, but can also comment on the completeness of excision, i.e., whether the tumour has been completely removed. A full endoscopic examination of the larynx, trachea, and esophagus is often performed at the time of biopsy.|$|E
25|$|When {{dealing with}} tons of water, {{it has to}} be {{distributed}} evenly and slowly. Occasionally main channels will need maintenance, or may be damaged due to external reasons. In order to even assess the problem, tons of water need to be removed from the main channel. The best {{way to do this is}} to slow the overall flow from the main dam and redirect all water flowing originally through the damaged channel to backup channels. Radial gates serve this purpose, they regulate the flow of water. It is imperative to keep water flowing. Lack of the flow <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> compromise all irrigation linked to that channel but also all cities linked will experience a power outage.|$|E
25|$|At more {{realistic}} levels, developing countries can strive to achieve primary wastewater treatment or secure septic systems, and carefully analyse wastewater outfall design to minimise impacts to {{drinking water and}} to ecosystems. Developed countries can not only share technology better, including cost-effective wastewater and water treatment systems but also in hydrological transport modeling. At the individual level, people in developed countries can look inward and reduce overconsumption, which further strains worldwide water consumption. Both developed and developing countries can increase protection of ecosystems, especially wetlands and riparian zones. These measures <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> conserve biota, but also render more effective the natural water cycle flushing and transport that make water systems more healthy for humans.|$|E
