5|$|The {{story begins}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet,</b> {{sensitive}} 15-year-old boy named Charlie writing letters {{about his life}} to an unknown recipient. Charlie chooses that person because {{he said that he}} heard the person was nice and thought that this person would not be judgmental. He discusses his first year at high school, grappling with two traumatic experiences from his past: the suicide of his only middle-school friend, Michael Dobson, a year before, and the death of his favorite aunt, Helen, during his early childhood.|$|E
5|$|Both the Blazers and Mavericks started Game 4 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> first half, with Dallas leading slightly. The Blazers then {{missed their}} first 15 shots after halftime as the Mavs' lead grew {{as big as}} 67–44. Roy then made a three-pointer {{near the end of}} the third to cut the lead to 67–49. In the fourth quarter, Roy scored 18 points after going 1-for-3 the {{previous}} 3 quarters, including a clutch 4-point play to tie the game and a bank shot from the middle of the paint with 49 seconds left to give his team the lead for good, finishing with 24 points to lead the Blazers to an improbable 84–82 win to tie the series. The Blazers would go on to lose the series in 6 games, but it gave hope for Roy to start again next season.|$|E
5|$|The volume, pitch, tempo {{and order}} of notes {{can be changed}} {{depending}} on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There {{are a variety of}} contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through. An Australian raven will give a longer caa with a downward inflexion to signify its return to the nest to its mate.|$|E

25|$|Geary {{was also}} a capable lower order batsman who usually relied upon hitting, but could get runs <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet,</b> if unstylish {{determination}} when they were desperately needed. Though he never scored a thousand runs - his best aggregates were 923 in 1929 and 900 in 1925 - his runs were frequently of great value to a county that never possessed any of the exceptionally high-class batsmen other counties could command in Geary's heyday. Owing to his considerable height and reach, Geary was an excellent slip catcher and, despite all the bowling he had to do, almost always his county's leading fielder.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} of the four games, Hill led all scorers with 21 points and helped the Spurs defeat the Utah Jazz, 82–57. He {{followed}} up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> offensive performance, 6 points, in a win against the NBDL Ambassadors, before scoring 18 points in a loss versus the Gerald Green-led Mavericks. In the final game of the Revue, Hill once again struggled with his shooting (1–7) but managed to make key plays with the game on the line. Hill made two clutch free throws with 6.9 seconds left and then forced a turnover on the defensive end to beat the previously undefeated Atlanta Hawks.|$|E

60|$|And {{then they}} parted, and the earl rode back home <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quieter</b> pace {{than that which}} had brought him there, and in a {{different}} mood. He had pledged himself now to Owen,--not to Owen of Castle Richmond, but to Owen of Hap House--and he intended to redeem his pledge if it were possible. He had been so conquered by the nobleness of his friend, that he had forgotten his solicitude for {{his family and his}} sister.|$|R
25|$|The first {{movement}} {{revolves around}} a diatonic melody that soon develops into complex pianistic figuration. The second theme opens with quiet exchanges between the orchestra and the piano before fully diving {{into the second}} theme in B major. The {{first part of the}} first theme is restated before the movement is pulled into a loud development section which opens with toccata like quavers in the piano and reaches a loud chordal section. The whole development exhibits features similar to a canon, such as an eighth note passage in the piano in which the left hand and the right hand play overlapping figures. The movement reaches a number of ferocious climaxes, especially in the cadenza. Rachmaninoff wrote two versions of this cadenza: the chordal original, which is commonly notated as the ossia, and a second one with a lighter, toccata-like style. Both cadenzas lead into a quiet solo section where the flute, oboe, clarinet and horn restate the first theme of the exposition, accompanied by delicate arpeggios in the piano. The cadenza then ends quietly, but the piano alone continues to play a quiet development of the exposition's second theme in E major before leading to the recapitulation, where the first theme is restated by the piano, with the orchestra accompanying, soon closing <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet,</b> rippling coda reminiscent of the second theme.|$|E

500|$|Philip French of The Observer {{considered}} Departures to be a [...] "moving, gently amusing" [...] film, {{which the}} director had [...] "fastidiously composed". Sharkey found it an [...] "emotionally wrenching trip <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> man", one which was well cast with [...] "actors who move lightly, gracefully" [...] {{in the various}} settings. In Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman gave the film a B−, considering it [...] "tender and, at times, rather squishy", though certain to affect anyone who had lost a parent. Barber found Departures to be [...] "heartfelt, unpretentious, [...] slyly funny", worth watching (though ultimately predictable). Mike Scott gave the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four, finding that it was [...] "a surprisingly uplifting examination of life and loss", with humour which perfectly complemented the [...] "moving and meaningful story", but lent itself to characters [...] "mug for the camera".|$|E

500|$|Steve Huey of Allmusic {{contrasts}} Brooks' and Dunn's voices, {{saying that}} Dunn [...] "was the quietly intense singer with the soulful voice, while Kix Brooks played {{the part of}} the high-energy showman." [...] He also describes their sound as [...] "a winning formula of rambunctious, rocked-up honky tonk with punchy, danceable beats [...] smooth, pop-tinged ballads." [...] In the book The New Generation of County Music Stars, David Dicaire describes Dunn as [...] "possess a soulful voice <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> intensity" [...] and a [...] "traditional country singer", while calling Brooks [...] "the opposite to Dunn's musical personality," [...] "a high-energy showman" [...] and [...] "the perfect accompaniment to his partner". Brooks sang lead on [...] "Lost and Found", [...] "Rock My World", [...] "You're Gonna Miss Me When I'm Gone", [...] "Mama Don't Get Dressed Up for Nothing", [...] "Why Would I Say Goodbye", and [...] "South of Santa Fe".|$|E
500|$|Cotton, {{normally}} {{of a very}} placid disposition, was indignant {{over the}} proceedings and lead a delegation to admonish Wilson for his uncharitable insinuations. On Saturday, 31 December 1636, the Boston congregants met to prefer charges against Wilson. [...] Governor Vane launched the attack, and was joined by {{other members of the}} congregation. [...] Wilson met the onslaught <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> dignity, and responded soberly to each of the accusations brought against him. [...] The crowd refused to accept his excuses, and demanded a vote of censure. At this point Cotton intervened, and with more restraint than his parishioners, offered that without unanimity a vote of censure was out of order. While the ultimate indignity of censure was averted, Cotton nevertheless gave a grave exhortation to his colleague to allay the temper of the congregants. The next day Wilson preached such a conciliatory sermon that even Governor Vane rose and voiced his approval.|$|E
500|$|The {{staff of}} Parks and Recreation {{conceived}} {{the idea that}} Ron Swanson had his birthdate redacted from all government documents early {{in the development of}} the series, and it eventually developed into the subplot featured in [...] "Eagleton" [...] where Leslie finds out about his birthday and plans a surprise for him. Michael Schur, co-creator of the series, said the scene when Leslie surprises Ron <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> evening alone was his favorite scene in the show. During the scene, Leslie and Ron declare their mutual admiration for one another. Schur said it was difficult to make such an outwardly emotional scene effective in a comedy, but he believed it ultimately worked because of Amy Poehler and Nick Offerman's strong performances. Poehler said of the scene: [...] "It's really sweet and it's just an example of how it's important to Leslie who she works with. It's just as important as the job itself. I completely relate to that." [...] Rashida Jones also praised the scene, which she said made her cry during a cast read-through of the script.|$|E

500|$|This comment {{illustrates}} {{well the}} general nature of Szigeti's reception by both critics and fellow musicians: while his musical insights, intellect, {{and depth of}} interpretation were almost universally lauded, the purely technical aspect of his playing was awarded a more mixed reaction. His tone in particular {{seems to have been}} occasionally uneven from performance to performance. A 1926 recital review in The New York Times, for example, laments that ... his performance was stiff and dry in its observance of letter and its absence of spirit ... Mr. Szigeti was not only inclined to dryness of tone and angularity of phrase, but there were also passages of poor intonation. In contrast, a review from the previous year in the same journal remarked after a performance of the Beethoven concerto that Mr. Szigeti has a rather small but beautiful tone, elegance, finish. He played <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> sincerity which grew upon the audience, though not with the virility and sweep that other violinists find ... it is clear that Mr. Szigeti is a player to command esteem and respect for his musicianship, for the genuineness of his interpretations, and his artistic style.|$|E
500|$|In 1949 Cardus {{set up his}} London home at the National Liberal Club, while Edith took a flat in Bickenhall Mansions, {{just off}} Baker Street. The pair lived harmoniously apart, though in {{frequent}} contact, until Edith's death. Cardus found London's musical life invigorating, with five major orchestras {{and a host of}} distinguished conductors and solo artists performing regularly. Toscanini paid his final visit to England in 1952, with two concerts at the Royal Festival Hall. Outside London, Cardus was a regular visitor to the Edinburgh Festival and to Glyndebourne, and was in Manchester for the reopening of the Free Trade Hall and the [...] "homecoming" [...] of the Hallé Orchestra in November 1951. The inaugural concert concluded with Kathleen Ferrier singing [...] "Land of Hope and Glory". Cardus had first heard Ferrier at the Edinburgh Festival in 1947; he became a devoted admirer to the extent that, eventually, questions were raised about his critical blindness to her technical weaknesses. He wrote of her singing that it was, [...] "like the woman herself... imbued <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> but reliant sense and a feeling for the fun and goodness of life". He was devastated by her death from cancer in October 1953; the following year he edited and contributed to a memorial volume of tributes.|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} to England, Heber {{prepared}} for Holy Orders at Oxford, where he found time for literary pursuits, was active in university politics and led a busy social life. He was ordained as deacon {{at the end of}} February 1807 and received full priest's orders from the Bishop of Oxford on 24 May 1807. He was then inducted into the family living, as rector of Hodnet; he was later to describe his role as [...] "a half-way station between a parson and a squire". At first he divided his time between his parish and Oxford, where he continued working for his M.A. degree and fulfilled duties at All Souls. He had not at this time determined his own doctrinal position; writing to Thornton he admitted that he was still searching: [...] "Pray for me, my dear friend, that I may have my eyes open to the truth ... and if it please God that I persevere in his ministry I may undertake the charge <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> mind and a good conscience". A High churchman by upbringing, Heber was a strong opponent of factional rivalry; he eventually found a place around the midpoint of the Anglican spectrum between the High Church and evangelical wings, with perhaps a slight inclination towards the evangelicals.|$|E

5000|$|... "In some ways, Dunst {{gives the}} film’s most {{impressive}} performance," [...] wrote Jonathan Rosenbaum, {{who called the}} film a must-see. [...] "What’s masterful about Bogdanovich’s direction is the cumulative detail, which adds complexity to incidental as well as central characters. He has a graceful way of switching viewpoints from one character to another and an uninsistent yet mainly persuasive sense of period. … This picture might well be considered a more impressive accomplishment than many of his early pictures. But it speaks <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quieter</b> voice, and what it says seems substantially more personal and thoughtful." ...|$|R

500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for Rolling Stone, music critic David Fricke gave the album a favorable review, saying that Pearl Jam [...] "hurtles into the mystic at warp speed." [...] He also added that Pearl Jam [...] "wring {{a lot of}} drama out of a few declarative power chords swimming in echo." [...] Allan Jones of Melody Maker suggested in his review of Ten that it is Vedder that [...] "provides Pearl Jam with such a uniquely compelling focus." [...] AllMusic staff writer Steve Huey called it a [...] "flawlessly crafted hard rock masterpiece" [...] and felt that Vedder's [...] "impressionistic lyrics" [...] are more effective through his passionate vocal delivery rather than their [...] "concrete meaning." [...] Q called it [...] "raucous modern rock, spiked with infectious guitar motifs and powered with driving bass and drums," [...] and said it [...] "may well be {{the face of the}} 90's metal." [...] Stereo Review said that [...] "the band sounds larger than life, producing a towering inferno of roaring guitars, monumental bass and drums, and from-the-gut vocals." [...] Don Kaye of Kerrang! defined the album [...] "introspective and charged <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>quiet</b> emotional force". Greg Kot wrote in the Chicago Tribune, [...] "Occasionally overwrought and unrelentingly humorless, the music nonetheless exerts a hypnotic power at its best." ...|$|E
