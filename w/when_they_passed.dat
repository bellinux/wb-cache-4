5|$|By November 1885, Adler had a {{theatrical}} club of his own, the Princes Street Club, No. 3 Princes Street (now Princelet Street, E1), purpose-built, financed by a butcher named David Smith. It seated 300; playing every night except Friday, he was earning about £3 s.10 a week, {{but with a}} fame well {{out of proportion to}} the meagre money. Many of the most prominent figures in Yiddish theater, including Sigmund Mogulesko, David Kessler, Abba and Clara Shoengold, and Sara Heine (the future Sara Adler), gave guest performances <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through London.|$|E
5|$|On his death-bed, Josquin {{asked that}} he be listed on the rolls as a foreigner, so that his {{property}} would not pass to the Lords and Ladies of Condé. This bit of evidence {{has been used to}} show that he was French by birth. Additionally, he left an endowment for the performance of his late motet, Pater noster, at all general processions in the town <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> in front of his house, stopping to place a wafer on the marketplace altar to the Holy Virgin. Pater noster may have been his last work.|$|E
5|$|Wail al-Shehri, {{his brother}} Waleed, and Satam al-Suqami arrived {{together}} at Logan Airport at 06:45 {{on the morning}} of September 11, 2001. Upon check-in, all three men were selected by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) for further screening of their checked baggage. As the CAPPS was only for luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint. One of the five Globe Aviation security screeners on-duty later reported that either Wail or Waleed had been using a crutch <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through security, and that the crutch had been X-rayed as per regulations.|$|E

5|$|In {{their efforts}} to monitor the French, Cochrane's {{squadron}} had become divided, so that Neptune and Pompee were the only ships within reach of Troude's squadron <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through the channel. Neither ship was well placed to fight the larger French force and both were taken by surprise, only alerted to the French escape by the brig HMS Hazard under Captain Hugh Cameron shortly before 22:00. Pompee was closest to the French, and Captain William Charles Fahie managed to fire two broadsides into the rearmost ship, Hautpoult before Troude's squadron pulled away from her. Neptune, Pompee and the small brig HMS Recruit took up the chase, the fast Recruit annoying the French with persistent minor attacks, while Neptune came too close to Hautpoult and was fired on, losing one man killed and four wounded. The French escape, while necessitated by the British battery, was actually a feint: the frigates Félicité and Furieuse had remained hidden off the Saintes during the night and at 09:00 on 15 April, with the main combat continuing to the west, slipped away into Basse-Terre on Guadeloupe, chased in vain by HMS Intrepid under Captain Warwick Lake. French batteries drove off the British pursuit and the frigates were anchored in harbour and their stores successfully unloaded.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{expenditures}} quickly strained the government's already fragile {{financial situation}} and Sherman, {{assigned to the}} Senate Finance Committee, {{was involved in the}} process of increasing the revenue. In July 1861, Congress authorized the government to issue Demand Notes, the first form of paper money issued directly by the United States government. The notes were redeemable in specie (i.e., gold or silver coin) but, as Sherman would note in his memoirs, they did not solve the revenue problem, as the government did not have the coin to redeem the notes should they all be presented for payment. To solve this problem, Chase asked for and Congress authorized the issuance of $150 million in bonds, which (as banks purchased them with gold) replenished the treasury. Congress also sought to increase revenue <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> the Revenue Act of 1861, which imposed the first federal income tax in American history. Sherman endorsed the measure, and even spoke in favor of a steeper tax than the one imposed by the Act (3% on income above $800), preferring to raise revenue by taxation than by borrowing. In August, the special session closed and Sherman returned home to Mansfield to promote military recruitment again.|$|E

25|$|Stallard rode {{his last}} race {{when he was}} 56, in Doncaster. Racing as he grew older became {{difficult}} because the British Cycling Federation's rules classed all riders as veterans <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> 40. Stallard argued that veterans' races should be organised in age-groups and he clashed again with cycling authorities by forming an organisation to make that possible.|$|E
25|$|On 18 December 1499, {{as part of}} this effort, constable Velasco de Barrionuevo and an {{assistant}} were taking a female elche from Albayzín for such questioning. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through a square, she shouted that she was being forced to become Christian.

La Salle then had their victory parade pass through all UAAP schools - <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through the FEU campus, the motorcade was bombarded with debris.|$|E
25|$|In 1794 {{the ideas}} of the French Revolution reached Rende. The harassment, taxes and the inequities {{increased}} the hate towards the Bourbon domain. Spokesman of this grumpiness was Domenico Vanni who received Joachim Murat, Marshal of Napoleon, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> by Cosenza. In 1817 the castle was sold to the Magdalone family, owner of many lands in the Marquisate. During the Resurgence, also Rendesis got tired of the French and Borbonics and many of them became Carbonari participating in the insurrections of 1820-21 and 1831.|$|E
25|$|Lewis and Clark {{stayed with}} the Mandan <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through the Upper Missouri region on their {{expedition}} to the Northwest, including five months {{in the winter of}} 1804-1805. Sakagawea, a Shoshone who had been kidnapped and adopted by the Hidatsa at an early age, joined the expedition as an interpreter and native guide. Because of her contributions, she was honored with an image on the U.S. dollar coin. On the return trip, the expedition brought the Mandan chief Sheheke Shote with them back to Washington, DC.|$|E

25|$|S. 4893 was {{considered}} by the House of Representatives on March 2, 1921, with two days remaining in the congressional session.

Gard asked Vestal if the Missouri bill was identical to the earlier bills, and if it contained the same safeguards, and Vestal confirmed these.

25|$|The {{rules on}} what a driver can tow are {{different}} depending on <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> their driving test.

They must pass the car and trailer driving test to tow anything heavier. If a driver passed their car test before 1 January 1997, they are usually allowed to drive a vehicle and trailer combination up to 8,250kg MAM. They are also allowed to drive a minibus with a trailer over 750kg MAM.|$|E
25|$|Lodge was a Christian Spiritualist. In 1909 he {{published}} the book Survival of Man which expressed {{his belief that}} life after death had been demonstrated by mediumship. His most controversial book was Raymond or Life and Death (1916). The book documented the séances {{that he and his}} wife had attended with the medium Gladys Osborne Leonard. Lodge was convinced that his son Raymond had communicated with him and the book is a description of his son's experiences in the spirit world. According to the book Raymond had reported that people who had died were still the same people <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> over, there were houses, trees and flowers and the Spirit world looked similar to earth but there is no disease. The book also claimed that when soldiers died in World War I they had smoked cigars and received whisky in the spirit world and because of such statements the book was criticised. Walter Cook wrote a rebuttal to Lodge Reflections on Raymond (1917) that directly challenged Lodge's beliefs in Spiritualism.|$|E

500|$|Darkening of {{the skin}} is also caused by decomposition. The staking of a swollen, decomposing body could cause the body to bleed and force the {{accumulated}} gases to escape the body. This could produce a groan-like sound when the gases moved past the vocal cords, or a sound reminiscent of flatulence <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through the anus.

500|$|On November 6, 2012, Colorado and Washington {{became the}} first states to legalize the sale and {{possession}} of cannabis for recreational use since the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> Colorado Amendment 64 and Washington Initiative 502. Each regulated marijuana in a way similar to alcohol, allowing possession of up to an ounce for adults ages 21 and older, with [...] "DUID" [...] provisions similar to those against drunk driving. Unlike Initiative 502, Amendment 64 allows personal cultivation (of up to 6 plants). Both provide for commercial cultivation and sales, subject to regulation and taxes.

500|$|Dawson Creek {{is a city}} {{in northeastern}} British Columbia, Canada. The {{municipality}} of [...] had a population of 11,583 in 2011. Dawson Creek derives {{its name from the}} creek of the same name that runs through the community. The creek was named after George Mercer Dawson by a member of his land survey team <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> through the area in August 1879. Once a small farming community, Dawson Creek became a regional centre after the western terminus of the Northern Alberta Railways was extended there in 1932. The community grew rapidly in 1942 as the US Army used the rail terminus as a transshipment point during construction of the Alaska Highway. In the 1950s, the city was connected to the interior of British Columbia via a highway and railway through the Rocky Mountains. Since the 1960s, growth has slowed.|$|E
