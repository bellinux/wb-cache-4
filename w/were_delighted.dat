5|$|The Germans <b>were</b> <b>delighted</b> {{with this}} outcome, and {{were happy to}} give up the {{sacrifice}} of a small provincial rail centre to Poland in exchange for the ensuing propaganda benefits. It spread the blame of the partition of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, made Poland a participant in the process and confused political expectations. Poland was accused of being an accomplice of Nazi Germany – a charge that Warsaw was hard-put to deny.|$|E
5|$|Harding's {{appointment}} of Harry M. Daugherty as Attorney General received more criticism than any other. Daugherty's Ohio lobbying and back room maneuvers {{were not considered}} to qualify him for his office. When the scandals broke in 1923 and 1924, Daugherty's many enemies <b>were</b> <b>delighted</b> {{at the prospect of}} connecting him with the dishonesty, and assumed he had taken part in Teapot Dome, though Fall and Daugherty were not friends. In February 1924, the Senate voted to investigate the Justice Department, where Daugherty remained Attorney General.|$|E
5|$|The Guardian {{reviewer}} {{observed that}} the setting of Mr Perrin and Mr Traill – a second-rate public school – was clearly drawn from life, as indeed it was. The boys of Epsom College <b>were</b> <b>delighted</b> with the thinly disguised version of their school, but the college authorities were not, and Walpole was persona non grata at Epsom for many years. This was of no practical consequence, as {{he had no intention}} of returning to the teaching profession, but it was an early illustration of his capacity, noted by Benson, for unthinkingly giving offence, though being hypersensitive to criticism himself.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet Union {{supported}} the Vietnamese in their 1978 invasion of Cambodia, an invasion {{considered by the}} First World, most notably the United States, and the People's Republic of China {{to be under the}} direct command of the Soviet Union. The USSR also became the largest backer of the new puppet state in Cambodia, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK). In a 1979 summit Jimmy Carter complained to Brezhnev about the presence of Vietnamese troops in Cambodia, to which Brezhnev replied that the citizens of the PRK <b>were</b> <b>delighted</b> about the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge-led government; in this, as historian Archie Brown notes, he was right.|$|E
5|$|In late 1999, the Who {{performed}} as a five-piece {{for the first}} time since 1985, with Bundrick on keyboards and Starkey on drums. The first show in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Garden Arena was partially broadcast on TV and the Internet and released as the DVD The Vegas Job. They then performed acoustic shows at Neil Young's Bridge School Benefit at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California, followed by gigs at the House of Blues in Chicago and two Christmas charity shows at the Shepherds Bush Empire in London. Critics <b>were</b> <b>delighted</b> to see a rejuvenated band with a basic line-up comparable to the tours of the 1960s and 1970s. Andy Greene in Rolling Stone called the 1999 tour better than the final one with Moon in 1976.|$|E
25|$|Landscape {{architect}} Ernst Cramer, {{who considered}} himself {{more of an}} artist than a gardener, designed an abstract landscape by using earthen mounds, water and modern iron sculptures. The whole facility was built with respect to abstract-geometrical principles. Whereas the public was confused by its design, experts <b>were</b> <b>delighted.</b>|$|E

25|$|In January 1730, the French {{attempted}} to besiege the main fort of the Natchez, {{but they were}} driven off. Two days later a force of about 500 Choctaw attacked and captured the fort, killing at least 100 Natchez, and recovered about 50 French captives and 50-100 African slaves. French leaders <b>were</b> <b>delighted,</b> but surprised when the Choctaw demanded ransoms for the captives.|$|E
25|$|In 1897, the Transatlantic Company of Paris ordered {{two of a}} {{total of}} ten fast mail steamers for their African service at A & J Inglis. Inglis {{delivered}} two weeks ahead of their competitors. The French owners were impressed and checked carefully that the fast-track build programme had not resulted in an inferior quality, but found no evidence of this, on the contrary they <b>were</b> <b>delighted</b> with the high standard of construction achieved.|$|E
25|$|But {{the idea}} of the Eugene Mall had been {{considered}} by civic leaders prior to the 1960s. In 1945, for example, Fred Cuthbert proposed closing Willamette Street to cars {{in order to create a}} landscaped pedestrian oasis in the center of town, and he suggested parking along the perimeter. As part of the Eugene Centennial Celebration in 1959, a section of Broadway from Oak Street to Charnelton Street was closed to motor traffic, and pedestrians <b>were</b> <b>delighted.</b>|$|E

25|$|Boeing's {{decision}} {{to go ahead with}} the 717 slowly began to pay off. Early 717 operators <b>were</b> <b>delighted</b> with the reliability and passenger appeal of the type and decided to order more. The small Australian regional airline Impulse took a long-term lease on five 717s in early 2000 to begin an expansion into mainline routes. The ambitious move could not be sustained in competition with the majors, and Impulse sold out to Qantas in May 2001.|$|E
25|$|Paramount {{of course}} <b>were</b> <b>delighted.</b> The {{majority}} of stars were earmarked as such when they {{appeared on the}} horizon—from Broadway or from wherever they came; if it seemed unlikely that public acceptance would come with one film they were trained and built up: the incubation period was usually between two and five years. As far as Ladd was concerned, he was a small-part actor given a fat part faute de mieux and after his second film for them he had not merely hit the leading-men category, but had gone beyond it to films which were constructed around his personality.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Portuguese missionaries in India {{starts with the}} neo-apostles who reached Kappad near Kozhikode on 20 May 1498 along with the Portuguese {{explorer}} Vasco da Gama who was seeking to form anti-Islamic alliances with pre-existing Christian nations. The lucrative spice trade was further temptation for the Portuguese crown. When he and the Portuguese missionaries arrived they found Christians {{in the country in}} Malabar known as St. Thomas Christians who belonged to the then-largest Christian church within India. The Christians were friendly to Portuguese missionaries at first; there was an exchange of gifts between them, and these groups <b>were</b> <b>delighted</b> at their common faith.|$|E

25|$|John Willis-Bund {{states that}} the battle of Camp Hill was {{remarkable}} {{from the fact that}} an armed mob—they were nothing more—twice repulsed assaults of the best troops in the Royalist army, who attacked them in overwhelming numbers. That less than 300 men should keep some 1,800 at bay, even for a short time, was an act that deserved to be recorded; that they, an untrained mob, should have checked the dreaded Royalist cavalry, was a still greater achievement. The Parliamentarians <b>were</b> <b>delighted,</b> and they had reason to be. Captain Greaves, probably a local man, {{a member of the family}} that lived at King's Norton, who commanded the Parliament troops, might well be proud of his men's achievement.|$|E
25|$|On 1 February 1814, Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher with 80,000 Allied {{troops from}} his own Army of Silesia and Austrian Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg's Army of Bohemia {{defeated}} Napoleon and 45,000 French soldiers in the Battle of La Rothière. This setback seriously shook the French army's morale. Each side suffered about 6,000 casualties but the Allied captured 50–60 artillery pieces. The Allies <b>were</b> <b>delighted</b> by their victory, though {{it might have been}} more complete if all their reserves had been committed to the battle. At this time, the Allied generals made the questionable decision to separate their armies. Blücher's army would advance from Châlons-sur-Marne toward Meaux while Schwarzenberg's army operated on a more southerly route from Troyes toward Paris.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan {{and their}} {{supporters}} <b>were</b> <b>delighted</b> with such a convincing victory over a side who had recently triumphed over Australia. England, on the other hand, had some serious questions to ask of themselves, and realised that winning back the Ashes {{was by no means}} the ultimate achievement. In fact, the loss of the first test in Multan is considered by many analysts of the game to be a turning point for the fortunes of the England side, one from which they still have not fully come back from to this date. It was a match they should have won, and they assumed they would win. However, Pakistan took advantage of their complacency and basically dominated the series from that point onwards.|$|E

25|$|In 1982 the ORIGINAL Clarice Cliff Collectors Club {{was formed}} and {{promoted}} {{her and her}} work throughout the world. The club founder had appealed in the Staffordshire Evening Sentinel for anyone who worked with Cliff to contact him and was delighted when he found 28 former workers. Still calling themselves the 'Bizarre girls' even in their mid 70s and early 80s Cliff's former painters <b>were</b> <b>delighted</b> in the interest in the pottery they had hand painted 50 years earlier. They attended the annual meetings of the club, and were {{to be involved in}} many television and radio programmes about Cliff, and a mass of books that appeared. Many of their memories were recorded in the CCCC Reviews from 1982 to 2004. The club also held meetings and exhibitions in Britain, North America, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|The {{alligators}} {{were the}} central attraction and thrived. At {{one time the}} pond contained {{as many as seven}} of the reptiles. Most visitors to the park would rest on the wall surrounding the pond and watch the alligators. The reptiles quickly became a staple of the El Paso Culture. In 1952, an alligator named Oscar was hauled to Texas Western College and, as a prank, placed inside geology Professor Howard Quinn's office. On another occasion an alligator was found in the swimming pool at the college right before an intramural swim meet. Sally, one of the first alligators placed in the pond, was the object of a weight-guessing contest. The closest guess won $100 and a trip to Mexico. In 1952, Minnie, a 54-year-old female alligator, laid an egg in the pond and spectators <b>were</b> <b>delighted</b> when they saw a protective Minnie spring to life and rush towards her egg as park employees cleaned the pond.|$|E
25|$|Adams quickly endeared {{himself to}} the {{supporters}} with wins over the Championship's two Sheffield sides in the League Cup, United and Wednesday, before they lost out to Scunthorpe United in the Third Round, after extra time. Arriving into the play-off places {{for the first time}} in the season with just two games remaining, they stumbled at the finish to end up in a respectable tenth place. History repeated itself for the start of 2010–11, with new signing Justin Richards scoring a brace in a 3–1 win at Queens Park Rangers in the League Cup First Round. Adams left the club in December 2010, with Vale second in the table, and it was left to Jim Gannon to finish the promotion job. Gannon's remarkably turbulent reign ended after 74 days. During this time he got into a bust-up with assistant manager Geoff Horsfield which received national press, alienating fans and players alike in the process. Mark Grew failed to lift the club back into the play-offs, though at the end of the season supporters <b>were</b> <b>delighted</b> to learn that Micky Adams would be returning as manager. However the club continued to lose money, and fans demanded a change in the boardroom after a series of promised investments failed to bear fruit. Genuine hopes of promotion in 2011–12 were brought to an end after the club were issued a winding up petition by HM Revenue and Customs on 29 February 2012; the club were by this time unable to pay tax bills, creditors, or staff wages. The club entered administration on 9 March. The ten-point deduction left the club in mid-table, and the club remained without an owner for the start of the 2012–13 season. The club exited administration on 20 November 2012, and Tom Pope scored 33 goals to fire Vale to promotion back to League One with a third-place finish. They stabilised in the division under new boss Rob Page, before chairman Norman Smurthwaite orchestrated the departure of Page and his squad in favour of the club's first foreign manager, Bruno Ribeiro, in June 2016. The result was relegation back into League Two at the end of the 2016–17 season, after which Smurthwaite resigned as chairman.|$|E
