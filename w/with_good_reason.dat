40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via [URL] this article I ask two questions prompted by the phenomenon of ‘politically patterned’ climate change denial. First, can an individual's political commitments provide her <b>with</b> <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> not to defer to cognitive experts’ testimony? Building on work in philosophy of science on inductive risk, I argue they can. Second, can an individual's political commitments provide her <b>with</b> <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> not to defer to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's testimony? I argue that they cannot (at least, in the way identified {{in the first part}} of the article), because of the high epistemic standards which govern that body's assertions. The conclusion discusses the theoretical and practical implications of my arguments...|$|R

500|$|The {{reign of}} Æthelstan has been {{overshadowed by the}} {{achievements}} of his grandfather, Alfred the Great, but he is now {{considered one of the}} greatest kings of the West Saxon dynasty. Modern historians endorse the view of twelfth century chronicler William of Malmesbury that [...] "no one more just or more learned ever governed the kingdom". Frank Stenton and Simon Keynes both describe him as the one Anglo-Saxon king who will bear comparison with Alfred. In Keynes's view he [...] "has long been regarded, <b>with</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason,</b> as a towering figure in the landscape of the tenth century... he has also been hailed as the first king of England, as a statesman of international standing".

[...] The first tuition freeze required the university to find $40 million in savings or new revenue. In order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes, Daniels and the Purdue Board of Trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers, investing cash reserves and switching to a consumer-driven health plan for employees.|$|E

Thomas did not immediately recoil from the idea.

2500|$|The {{indefinite}} {{borders of}} Spain's province of La Florida were {{being challenged by}} other European powers {{at the end of}} the 17th and the beginning of the 18th centuries.

Under the previous administration of interim governor Juan de Ayala y Escobar, the territory of La Florida had been attacked frequently by these restive tribes and the English, who continued to harass the Spanish, hoping to hinder their trade and force them to abandon the province.
