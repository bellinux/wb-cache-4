Despite the failure to control inflation, controls were slowly ended, and on April 30, 1974, their statutory authorization lapsed.|$|E

5|$|On 14 March 1471, Edward's army {{landed at}} Ravenspurn. Gathering more men as they went, the Yorkists moved inland towards York. Edward's march was unopposed at the {{beginning}} because he was moving through lands {{that belonged to the}} Percys, and the Earl of Northumberland was indebted to the Yorkist king for the return of his northern territory. Furthermore, Edward announced that he <b>was</b> <b>returning</b> only to claim his father's title of Duke of York and not to contest the English crown. The ruse was successful: Montagu, who was monitoring Edward's march, could not convince his men to move against the Yorkist king.|$|E
