5|$|The {{election}} <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to call {{on election}} night.

5|$|There was an {{unsubstantiated}} {{rumor that}} Lucasfilm pressured Paramount {{to change the}} film's original working title, The Vengeance of Khan, claiming that it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the working title for their upcoming Star Wars film. However, {{as soon as the}} name change was made, Lucasfilm also changed their title to Return of the Jedi, justifying the change by claiming that the Jedi did not seek revenge, only the Sith.|$|E

5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely.|$|E
5|$|Hextall's first {{international}} recognition {{came when he}} was named as part of Team Canada's squad for the 1987 Canada Cup. During a practice session, he chopped Sylvain Turgeon's arm with his stick during a scrimmage, claiming that the left wing <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the goal. Turgeon missed the tournament with a fractured arm; Hextall was back-up to Grant Fuhr and did not play a single game. He later represented Canada in the 1992 World Championships, playing five games to record one win and a GAA of 2.86 as Canada were eliminated in the quarter-finals.|$|E
5|$|Mosley {{was elected}} to his third term as {{president}} of the FIA in 2001. From 2000, Formula One saw the return of teams partly or wholly owned and operated by major motor manufacturers, who feared that under Ecclestone's management F1 coverage would go to pay television, reducing the value of their investment. In 2001, the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association (GPMA) announced an alternative world championship, the Grand Prix World Championship to start by 2008. The GPMA stipulated that the championship should not be regulated by the FIA, which Lovell believes was because the organisation believed Mosley <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to Ecclestone. The proposed championship came to nothing and the GPMA later became the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA).|$|E

5|$|Unaware that Novara {{had been}} disabled, and fearing that his ships would be drawn {{too close to}} the Austrian naval base at Cattaro, Acton broke off the pursuit. The {{destroyer}} Acerbi misread the signal, and attempted to launch a torpedo attack, but was driven off by the combined fire of Novara, Saida, and Helgoland. At 12:05, Acton realized the dire situation Novara was in, but by this time, the Sankt Georg group <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>close.</b> The Sankt Georg group rendezvoused with Novara, Saida, and Helgoland, and Csepel and Balaton reached the scene as well. The entire group returned to Cattaro together.|$|E
5|$|By December 1942 {{there were}} {{concerns}} that even Oak Ridge <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> {{to a major}} population center (Knoxville) {{in the unlikely event}} of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited DuPont in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard cost plus fixed-fee contract, but the President of the company, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the threat}} from Iselle, {{lieutenant}} governor candidate Warner Sutton requested that Governor Neil Abercrombie postpone the August9 primary. The governor declined the request, and the primary election occurred as scheduled. However, the storm damaged roads leading to two polling stations on the Big Island, prompting officials to decide the election by absentee ballot in those areas. After a close campaign between incumbent Senator Brian Schatz and Congresswoman Colleen Hanabusa, the senate primary, held {{on the same day}} as the gubernatorial primary, <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to call after Schatz led by only 1,635votes. As a result, the election hinged on the two closed polling stations, where more than 8,000people had the option to vote by mail. This was later changed to an in-person vote for August15, despite a challenge from the Hanabusa campaign with regards to storm damage, and Schatz ultimately won. The Hawaii American Civil Liberties Union later sued the state over how they handled the election.|$|E

5|$|Hayes attempted, unsuccessfully, {{to fill a}} third vacancy in 1881. Justice Noah Haynes Swayne {{resigned}} {{with the}} expectation that Hayes would fill his seat by appointing Stanley Matthews, who was a friend of both men. Many Senators objected to the appointment, believing that Matthews <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to corporate and railroad interests, especially those of Jay Gould, and the Senate adjourned without voting on the nomination. The following year, when James A. Garfield entered the White House, he re-submitted Matthews's nomination to the Senate, which this time confirmed Matthews by one vote, 24 to 23. Matthews served for eight years until his death in 1889. His opinion in Yick Wo v. Hopkins in 1886 advanced his and Hayes' views on the protection of ethnic minorities' rights.|$|E
5|$|In January 1978, Boeing {{announced}} a major extension of its Everett factory—which was then dedicated to manufacturing the 747—to accommodate its new wide-body family. In February 1978, the new jetliner received the 767 model designation, and three variants were planned: a 767-100 with 190 seats, a 767-200 with 210 seats, and a trijet 767MR/LR version with 200 seats intended for intercontinental routes. The 767MR/LR was subsequently renamed 777 for differentiation purposes. The 767 was {{officially launched on}} July 14, 1978, when United Airlines ordered 30 of the 767-200 variant, followed by 50 more 767-200 orders from American Airlines and Delta Air Lines later that year. The 767-100 was ultimately not offered for sale, as its capacity <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the 757's seating, while the 777 trijet was eventually dropped in favor of standardizing around the twinjet configuration.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} Second World War, Lympne was requisitioned by the Fleet Air Arm. It was named HMS Buzzard and n renamed HMS Daedalus II three months later, before being {{transferred}} to the Royal Air Force in May 1940. During the war Lympne was a front-line fighter base, RAF Lympne. It was heavily bombed during the Battle of Britain in 1940 and put out of action {{for a number of}} weeks. It <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the coast {{to be used as a}} squadron base, but squadrons were detached there on a day-to-day basis. Lympne was also to have been the landing place for a German aircraft used in a plot to kidnap Adolf Hitler, with preparations made by the Royal Air Force for his arrival.|$|E

5|$|Linois {{had twice}} failed to capture, or even seriously engage, large and {{valuable}} British merchant convoys on his cruise. When he saw scattered sails {{in the distance}} at 03:00 on 13 March 1806, he decided to investigate in his ship of the line Marengo, {{in the hope that}} the ships would again prove to be a merchant convoy. By the time he realised that the approaching ships were actually a powerful naval squadron, he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to outrun the lead ship, Warren's flagship HMS London. As London engaged Marengo, the French frigate Belle Poule attempted to escape from the approaching squadron independently, but was also run down and brought to battle by the British frigate HMS Amazon. Both engagements lasted over three hours and were bloody, the French ships surrendering after three and a half hours and losing nearly 70 men between them.|$|E
5|$|Senior Allied commanders {{disagreed}} {{over whether}} {{it was necessary to}} land forces in western New Britain. Lieutenant General George Kenney—commander of the Allied Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific—opposed the landings, arguing that his forces did not need air fields at Cape Gloucester as the existing bases in New Guinea and surrounding islands were adequate to support the planned landings in the region. Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender—commander of both the 7th Fleet and the Allied Naval Forces, Southwest Pacific Area—as well as Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey—commander of Task Force 76 (TF76)—supported occupying Cape Gloucester to secure both sides of the straits, but opposed the landing at Gasmata as it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the Japanese air bases at Rabaul. The Gasmata operation was cancelled in early November in response to the concerns raised by Kenney and the Navy as well as intelligence reports that the Japanese had reinforced their garrison there.|$|E
5|$|A minor {{incident}} in the K'iche' capital Q'umarkaj escalated to have important consequences. A K'iche' soldier tried to seize bread from a Kaqchikel woman who was selling it in the market. The woman refused the soldier and drove him off with a stick. The Kaqchikel demanded {{the execution of the}} K'iche' soldier while the K'iche' nobility demanded the punishment of the Kaqchikel bread seller. When the Kaqchikel lords refused to hand her over, the K'iche' lords sentenced Hun-Toh and Wuqu-Batz' to death against the wishes of the K'iche' king K'iq'ab. King K'iq'ab warned his Kaqchikel friends and advised them to flee Q'umarkaj. On the day 13 Iq' of the Kaqchikel calendar the four lords of the Kaqchikel led their people out of the K'iche' capital to found their own capital at Iximche. The exact year of this event is not known with certainty but {{is believed to have been}} between AD 1470 and 1485, with some scholars, such as Guillemín, preferring 1470. The Kaqchikel abandoned their previous capital Chiavar (speculated to be modern Chichicastenango) because it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to Q'umarkaj.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of that year, the German anarchist Augustin Souchy was invited by the Castro {{government}} to survey the agrarian sector. He was not impressed with what he found, and declared in his pamphlet Testimonios sobre la Revolución Cubana that the system <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the Soviet model. Three days after Souchy departed Cuba, the entire print run was seized by the government, and destroyed. However, an Argentinian anarchist publisher republished the pamphlet the following December. Around the same time, the ALC, alarmed at {{the movement of the}} Castro government towards a Marxist–Leninist form of rule, issued a declaration, under the name Grupo de Sindicalistas Libertarios to prevent reaction against the ALC's membership. The document declared opposition to the centralism, authoritarian tendencies, and militarism of the new government. After a denunciation of the document by the Secretary General of the Partido Comunista Cubano (PCC), anarchists failed in their search for a printer who would publish a reaction to the denunciation. The publication El Libertario published its last edition that summer.|$|E
5|$|Structure 5D-43 is {{an unusual}} radial temple in the East Plaza, built over a {{pre-existing}} twin pyramid complex. It {{is built into the}} end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry doorways and three stairways, the fourth (south) side <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the Central Acropolis for a stairway on that side. The building has a talud-tablero platform profile, modified from the original style found at Teotihuacan. In fact, {{it has been suggested that}} the style of the building has closer affinities with El Tajin and Xochicalco than with Teotihuacan itself. The vertical tablero panels are set between sloping talud panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols. Large flower symbols are set into the sloping talud panels, related to the Venus and star symbols used at Teotihuacan. The roof of the structure was decorated with friezes although only fragments now remain, showing a monstrous face, perhaps that of a jaguar, with another head emerging from the mouth. The second head possesses a bifurcated tongue but is probably not that of a snake. The temple, and its associated ballcourt, probably date to the reign of Nuun Ujol Chaak or that of his son Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, in the later part of the 7th century.|$|E
5|$|The 47th Division {{planned to}} attack with two brigades, each {{reinforced}} by a battalion from the reserve brigade, along {{either side of}} the Ypres–Comines Canal. Large numbers of machine-guns were organised to fire offensive and defensive barrages and signal detachments were organised to advance with the infantry. An observation balloon was reserved for messages by signal lamp from the front line, as insurance against the failure of telephone lines and message-runners. The divisional trench mortar batteries were to bombard the German front line opposite the 142nd Brigade, where it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> for the artillery to shell without endangering British troops. Wire-cutting began in mid-May, against considerable local retaliation by German artillery. At the end of May the two attacking brigades began training at Steenvoorde, on practice courses built to resemble the German positions to be attacked, using air reconnaissance photographs to mark the positions of machine-gun posts and hidden barbed wire. Divisional intelligence summaries were used to plan the capture of German company and battalion headquarters. The 140th Brigade with four tanks attached, was to occupy White Château and the adjacent part of , while the 142nd Brigade attacked the spoil heaps and the canal bank to the left. On 1 June, the British artillery began the intense stage of preparatory bombardment for trench-destruction and wire cutting and the two attacking brigades assembled for the attack from 4 to 6 June.|$|E
