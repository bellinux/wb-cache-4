5|$|Bush was not {{a natural}} melodist à la Dvorák, though he could produce an {{appealing}} tune when he set his mind to it. But he was a first-rate contrapuntist, and his harmonic world can glow with a rare internal warmth. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to claim that everything he wrote was a masterpiece – and equally idiotic to turn our backs on the many outstanding scores still awaiting assiduous attention.|$|E

25|$|Aware that {{a direct}} assault on Batman <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish,</b> Bane instead destroys {{the walls of}} Arkham Asylum—allowing its {{deranged}} inmates (including the Joker, Two-Face, the Riddler, the Scarecrow, the Mad Hatter, the Ventriloquist, Firefly, Poison Ivy, Cornelius Stirk, Film Freak and Victor Zsasz) to escape into Gotham City. Consequently, Batman is forced to recapture the escapees, a mission that takes him three months and drives him {{to the brink of}} mental and physical collapse. Exhausted, Batman returns to his home in Wayne Manor, only to find Bane waiting for him.|$|E
25|$|On December 6, 2006, Deming {{testified before}} the US Senate {{committee}} on the Environmental and Public Works, concluding that The amount of climatic warming {{that has taken place}} in the past 150 years is poorly constrained, and its cause--human or natural--is unknown. There is no sound scientific basis for predicting future climate change with any degree of certainty. If the climate does warm, {{it is likely to be}} beneficial to humanity rather than harmful. In my opinion, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to establish national energy policy on the basis of misinformation and irrational hysteria.|$|E
25|$|Ida S. Scudder {{realized}} that she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to go on alone in her fight to bring better health to South India's women. So she decided to open a medical school for girls. Skeptical males said she would be lucky to get three applicants; actually she had 151 the first year (1918), and has had to turn many away ever since. At first, the Reformed Church in America was the main backer of the Vellore school, but since Dr. Scudder agreed to make it coeducational it {{has the support of}} 40 missions. Of 242 students today, 95 are men.|$|E

500|$|Bryan's announcement, after {{gaining the}} Democratic nomination, {{that he would}} {{undertake}} a nationwide tour by rail, something then unusual for presidential candidates, put pressure on McKinley to match him. Hanna especially urged his candidate to hit the road. McKinley decided against this, feeling {{that he could not}} outdo Bryan, who was a brilliant stump speaker, and that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to try. [...] "I might as well put up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete against some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I have to think when I speak." [...] Furthermore, no matter how McKinley traveled, Bryan would upstage him by choosing a less comfortable manner. McKinley was unwilling to compete with Bryan on the Democrat's terms, and sought to find his own way to reach the people.|$|E
500|$|On 15 February 1990, in {{a speech}} {{delivered}} at the Sapienza University of Rome, Cardinal Ratzinger (later to become Pope Benedict XVI) cited some current views on the Galileo affair as forming what he called [...] "a symptomatic case that permits us to see how deep the self-doubt of the modern age, {{of science and technology}} goes today". Some of the views he cited were those of the philosopher Paul Feyerabend, whom he quoted as saying [...] "The Church at the time of Galileo kept much more closely to reason than did Galileo himself, and she took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of Galileo's teaching too. Her verdict against Galileo was rational and just and the revision of this verdict can be justified only on the grounds of what is politically opportune." [...] The Cardinal did not clearly indicate whether he agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend's assertions. He did, however, say [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such views." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarence {{did well}} in school, and upon his {{graduation}} from Waltham High School in 1903, he took the entrance examinations for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He passed, and after taking basic courses at the school, did advanced work in engineering. During the summers, he worked for J.B. Worcester & Co., a firm which had constructed much of the Boston subway system. While at school, he became a favourite pupil of Professor George Swain; after Howe graduated in 1907, Swain offered Howe a job as his teaching assistant. Howe accepted, although the young engineer felt that he should leave the Boston area to begin his career. Soon afterwards, Howe was offered an opportunity to become an engineering professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. A popular story about Howe was that Swain had Howe and fellow engineer James Barker toss a coin to see who would get the job. Barker denied the tale later in life, stating he {{had no interest in}} the position and no one who knew Howe <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> enough to gamble with him, as Howe had shown himself to be uncommonly lucky. [...] In any event, Howe had no better prospects in sight; unemployment among his classmates was high due to the Panic of 1907.|$|E

500|$|In August 2016, Singer {{said that}} Legion had been {{designed}} {{to fit into the}} X-Men universe, but also to stand alone, so [...] "you wouldn't have to label" [...] the relationship between the series and the films. Hawley explained that because the series is depicting the title character's [...] "subjective reality", it would not have to address any connections to the films straight away, noting that his series Fargo, which is connected to the 1996 film of the same name, at first [...] "had to stand on its own feet" [...] before exploring those connections more; [...] "We have to earn the right {{to be part of this}} universe. My hope is we create something so strong that the people in the movie studio call and say they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> enough not to connect these things." [...] He did state that [...] "you can't tell this story without" [...] acknowledging that Legion is the son of Charles Xavier, who appears in the films. This acknowledgement comes in [...] "Chapter 7", with the appearance of Xavier's signature wheelchair in one of Haller's memories. Hawley explained that Haller would look to learn more of his father in future seasons, with Xavier potentially making a physical appearance in the series at that point.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN gave [...] "Now is Not the End" [...] a {{score of}} 8 out of 10, {{indicating}} a [...] "Great" [...] episode, and praised the titular character, who he thought was [...] "expertly played" [...] by Atwell, {{as well as her}} dynamic with D'Arcy's Jarvis. Goldman felt that the period setting was used well, despite the episode feeling [...] "like a TV show compared to the Marvel movies (being a TV show and all)", and was happy that series was attempting to [...] "entertain on its own merits", rather than try [...] "to add some huge important element to [...] giant overarching storyline". Goldman did feel that Carter needed a more specific villain to fight, but stated that [...] "With only eight episodes, that hopefully will change quickly". Alan Sepinwall at HitFix found that the series had learned from the mistakes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and stood as its own entity. He praised Atwell's performance, the visual/period style, and D'Arcy as Jarvis, but he felt that Carter's sexist colleagues were cartoonish, saying [...] "not that sexism didn't exist in the era, but that it's a tough thing to dramatize from a modern perspective without feeling winky and smug. It's a dance many period dramas have to do, not always successfully, and while it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> to pretend a woman like Peggy wouldn't have had to deal with these kinds of idiots all the time, Agent Carter is at its liveliest when the three stooges are nowhere to be seen".|$|E
500|$|Axe to Fall was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews from critics. Metacritic, an aggregate review website, scored the album with 77 out of 100 or [...] "generally favorable" [...] based on ten reviews. Citing {{a wider range of}} music styles on Axe to Fall, many reviewers found the album to be Converge's most accessible album to date. The album features songs like the [...] "doomy [...] noisy" [...] track [...] "Worms Will Feed/Rats Will Feast," [...] the [...] "synth-drenched shoegazing" [...] track [...] "Wretched World" [...] and [...] "Kerry King-admiring solos" [...] on [...] "Reap What You Sow" [...] in addition to hardcore tracks like [...] "Effigy" [...] and [...] "Cutter." [...] Andrew Parks of Decibel commented on the album's wide range of sounds, stating [...] "it strikes the perfect balance between dry-heaved hardcore—blunt trauma tracks that bleed into one another and hover around the 1:40 mark—and post-metal opuses that embrace Converge's experimental impulses." [...] Juan Diniz of Mammoth Press noted that the album flowed really well, stating that [...] "every track compliments and balances out the one prior and after. To skip tracks <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>foolish</b> as it's a compendium of aggression, frustration, beauty, and brutality," [...] and that the album [...] "demands to be taken in as a whole." [...] Cosmo Lee of Pitchfork Media referred to Converge as [...] "this generation's Black Flag", and compared Axe to Fall to Black Flag's 1984 second studio album My War. Lee noted that Converge combined abrasiveness with [...] "slower, abstract sludge", much like how Black Flag mixed [...] "equal parts lightning and Black Sabbath" [...] on My War. Several reviewers compared the Axe to Fall to Converge's highly praised 2001 album, Jane Doe.|$|E
