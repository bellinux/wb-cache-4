5|$|The game's use of The Simpsons-style humor {{received}} a mixed reception. Both GameSpot and GameTrailers {{said that the}} game delivered more than enough laughs to make it worth playing through at least once. It was considered enjoyable for both hardcore and casual The Simpsons fans by IGN and GameDaily, who also called it a particularly appealing game for diehard fans. Despite the few problems that the game had, GameSpy {{said that it was}} <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> see the humorous parodies. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, however, believed that the game's humor could only carry it so far, and suggested that those interested in The Simpsons humor should purchase a box set of one of the television series' seasons instead. Joe Juba of Game Informer called the game an average experience. He elaborated that the game would appeal primarily to fans of the television series, but would not be worth playing for people unfamiliar with it.|$|E

Newton tells a story of how he and the {{producer}} pretended to be on-air and gave out Lane's home address to the listeners. Newton claims that the joke was <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> see Lane's reaction but that Lane repaid him for the practical joke. The program on 3UZ had many guests who had also appeared on the television show the night before. When moving to Sydney in 1987, Lane hosted a morning show on 2UE for two years. After ending his affiliation with 2UE, he moved to 2KY and hosted a competing breakfast program in 1989. His radio programs usually involved music and interviews with visiting entertainers.|$|E

A lot {{of days in}} the gym, a lot of sweat, a lot of hatred toward coach Steve Wojciechowski for all the stuff he put me through laughing. But <b>it</b> was all <b>worth</b> <b>it.</b> <b>It's</b> hard <b>to</b> see the future in all the work you put in. How's <b>it</b> going <b>to</b> help you, and is <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> <b>it?</b> It is. This really proves that.|$|R

25|$|The Republic of Texas era {{with the}} Indians {{can be divided}} into three phases: the {{diplomacy}} of Houston during his first term, the hostility of Lamar, and the resumed diplomatic efforts of Houston's second term. Sam Houston led the Republic to negotiate with the Comanche. They said they would stop raiding if they were given sufficient amounts of what they considered prerequisites for peaceful relations: gifts, trade, and regular face-to-face diplomacy. Houston, who enjoyed a good reputation among Indians, had married a mixed-race woman of Cherokee descent. He had lived in Indian Territory for years and learned about their cultures. He was willing to meet with the Comanche on their terms and believed, as a matter of policy, that it was <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> buy a few thousand dollars worth of presents. The Republic could not support the huge cost of a standing army for defense, and it {{might not be able to}} defeat the assembled might of the entire Comanche-Kiowa alliance, especially if they received Mexican help.|$|E

500|$|Rosenbaum's {{return as}} Lex Luthor {{was met with}} {{positive}} critical reception. Jensen felt that Rosenbaum's cameo was too short, {{but that it was}} <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> see him play Lex one last time. Carabott felt that the scene between Lex and Clark was [...] "worth the wait". Dyess-Nugent praised Rosenbaum's acting, arguing that it shook [...] "the show awake, sending the needle hurtling rudely into the red zone". He ultimately stated that Rosenbaum's acting—in both the finale and the series as a whole—was [...] "one of the great TV series performances of the past 10 years and proof once again that talent will blossom in the least expected places".|$|E

500|$|The {{testimony}} of Marshall and the Joint Chiefs rebutted many of MacArthur's arguments. Marshall emphatically declared {{that there had}} been no disagreement between himself, the President, and the Joint Chiefs. However, it also exposed their own timidity in dealing with MacArthur, and that they had not always kept him fully informed. Vandenberg questioned whether the Air Force could be effective against targets in Manchuria, while Bradley noted that the Communists were also waging limited war in Korea, having not attacked UN airbases or ports, or their own [...] "privileged sanctuary" [...] in Japan. Their judgment was that it was not <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> expand the war, although they conceded that they were prepared to do so if the Communists escalated the conflict, or if no willingness to negotiate was forthcoming. They also disagreed with MacArthur's assessment of the effectiveness of the South Korean and Chinese Nationalist forces. Bradley said: ...|$|E
500|$|Group members {{expressed}} {{just how}} demanding {{their role in}} the group had been, describing the job as [...] "hard work" [...] and [...] "a tough gig", with touring for nine months of every year and filming the television series for most of the remainder, creating little time in their lives for anything else. Members also saw importance of being [...] "career driven" [...] and in portraying a positive image of themselves to the public in their personal lives, being [...] "always on". However, the cast insisted that the stressful work was well <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> see a smile on a child's face, and described the bond between the members as [...] "like family". In 2005 Harding stated the lifestyle was [...] "quite hard in the beginning." [...] In October 2015 Robinson stated she had tried to leave the group [...] "after eight years" [...] but was convinced by producers to stay. She expressed that the following years she spent with the group were her favourite, and that she was proud of her decision to continue.|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks later}} in the Super Bowl, the Falcons played the Broncos, the game pitting coach Dan Reeves against his former team and their star quarterback, John Elway. Reeves had led the Broncos to three Super Bowl appearances, all losses, and he was fired as the Broncos' head coach after the 1992 NFL season. Afterward, Elway was quoted as saying, [...] "These last three years have been hell. I know I {{would not have been}} back here if Dan Reeves had been here. It wasn't <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me. I didn't enjoy it. It wasn't any fun, and I got tired of working with him." [...] Reeves responded by saying, [...] "Just tell him it wasn't exactly heaven for me either. One of these days I hope he grows up. Maybe he'll mature sometime." [...] During his tenure, Reeves had also fired Shanahan, who was an {{assistant}} coach on the team, and these points of contention became a media storyline entering the game. Nonetheless, all parties involved stated that any lingering animosity had long since passed.|$|E

500|$|Keith DeCandido, in a 2012 {{review for}} Tor.com, gave the episode {{a score of}} 7 out of 10. He said that the {{majority}} of the guest cast were [...] "pretty nowhere", but that the backbone of the episode was Lenard portraying Sarek, [...] "one of the most beloved recurring roles in the franchise's history, and this episode is a beautiful illustration of why". He called the telepathy plot [...] "dopey sci-fi stuff", but praised the direction of Landau in—among others—the concert scene, which he called a [...] "tour de force". He said, however, that the standout part of the episode was the interaction of Stewart and Lenard, who he referred to as [...] "two great actors at the absolute top of their game". He said that [...] "Stewart simply owns the mind-meld, a turbulent, raw scene that leaves the character of Sarek completely exposed, and Stewart sells it amazingly. At that point, the plot contrivances are forgotten, as you realize that the whole episode was <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> watch this amazing scene".|$|E
500|$|Critics had widely {{divergent}} {{views of}} Sue's storyline. Keller wrote, [...] "They made Sue Sylvester into a cartoon character." [...] Though he called Sue's {{destruction of the}} choir room [...] "a fun little parody to watch", he added, [...] "in {{the grand scheme of}} what was a pretty damn good episode, it {{was too much of a}} distraction", and worried that the role of Sue was becoming [...] "a big fat joke". While Canning also noted the shift in tone [...] "from despicable Sue to cartoony evil Sue", he enjoyed her [...] "attempt to hijack Secret Santa", and said it was [...] "another fun reason to love to hate Sue Sylvester". Hankinson felt that the Grinch was [...] "the perfect touchstone for the heartless Ms. Sylvester and Jane Lynch's lanky frame made the physical humor (think gliding around the base of the tree on her belly) really sing." [...] Poniewozik called Sue's transformation [...] "pretty amusing to watch", admitted that he doubted he would [...] "have been able to resist the urge to put the rangy Jane Lynch in that classic role" [...] and called Brittany as Cindy Lou Who [...] "unexpected, clever and surprisingly touching". Several reviewers commented favorably on Becky playing Max, including Canning, who wrote [...] "it was all <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> realize Becky is and always will be the Max to Sue's Grinch", and Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack declared, [...] "I totally love how Becky is becoming Sue’s little minion. It’s both adorable and hilarious." ...|$|E
500|$|Bandslam {{was bought}} by a studio back in 2004, but in late January 2007, Walden Media and Summit Entertainment {{announced}} that they would co-finance Bandslam, co-written by Todd Graff and Josh A. Cagan and directed by Graff. Graff was hired to direct in early March 2007 and rewrote the screenplay. Before filming, they had two weeks of music rehearsals. The actors and actresses were designated to play their instruments. Donowho and Michalka had extensive experience with the drums and guitar, respectively, so {{they were used to}} their instruments, but Lisa Chung, Scott Porter and Vanessa Hudgens were not. Hudgens told MTV News she didn't expect there to be as much music, and [...] "they are like, 'We are going to have two weeks of music rehearsals,' and I was like, 'What?' But it was really cool. It's definitely not the kind of music I do normally." [...] Principal photography began on February 9, 2008 in Austin, Texas. Although the film is set in New Jersey, Graff felt strongly {{that it was important to}} shoot in a place with a wide array of great live music to choose from. [...] "I'm a big believer in local scenes," [...] he says. [...] "I think it's the lifeblood of music. Austin is renowned as a music town, and rightly so. They have a ton of really great bands just trying to get their music out there. So, it's great we had an opportunity to use several unsigned local Texas bands." [...] In an interview with Los Angeles Times, director Todd Graff admitted there were cultural incongruities underlying the film. [...] "I know, it's demented. Every once in a while on set I would think to myself, 'I can't believe we got away with this'. I always thought if it only sent one kid to listen to a Velvet Underground record, it would be <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me." [...] All of the vocals were filmed live by each of the singing cast members, as mentioned by director Graff. One of the requirements for the film was that all actors had to be able to provide their own vocals. Because Aly Michalka was on tour with her sister AJ Michalka and Miley Cyrus, she did not arrive in Austin until midway through rehearsals. Conveniently, the tour's last stop was in Austin, where rehearsal and filming for the movie took place. All of the instruments and singing in the movie were recorded by the actors, with the exception of the guitar parts of Vanessa Hudgens and Scott Porter, as well as Lisa Chung's piano parts. Although Hudgens and Porter learned how to play their songs, they were dubbed by guitarists Jason Mozersky and JW Wright.|$|E

2500|$|As Díaz saw it, Indians impeded progress. It was not <b>worth</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{invest time}} and money to bring Indians out of their {{intellectual}} darkness and into a modern society through education. Díaz did not think Indians were biologically inferior to Europeans, but felt that centuries of subjugation had psychologically inhibited their ability to modernize. As mentioned in Creelman’s interview, Díaz claimed that Indians did not care to succeed because they could not see beyond the scope of a daily life. Indians needed a ruler to dictate their lives. However, this paternalistic approach to the Indian questioned turned from an issue of social welfare {{at the beginning of his}} presidency to one of indifference, so long as the economy kept progressing. On this point, Limantour and other científicos, played a great part because they “helped to alienate Díaz from the native peoples and this resulted in a growing indifference on the President’s part toward a wide sector of the population.” ...|$|E
