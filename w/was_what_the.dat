Also present in the tombs were items used to perform magic rituals, such as Shabtis and divine figurines.

5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Nathan Furst, whose preferred composition style of grand orchestra and electronica <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> film's producers were looking for. Initially {{ignorant of the}} Bionicle universe, he explored the official website after getting the job as composer to get better context for his music. This and discussions he had with staff helped {{in the creation of}} eight or nine specific themes. The overall style is grand orchestral, but includes elements of electronic and tribal music. Furst used elements of African, Polynesian, and Eastern European music to communicate the fact that Mata Nui was an island, and when he could he incorporated his music into the action rather than leaving it as a standalone element within scenes.|$|E
5|$|Winchelsey was a fearless {{opponent}} of Edward I. When he swore his oath of fealty to Edward, he offended the king {{by adding a}} declaration {{that he was only}} swearing fealty for the temporalities, not the spiritualities. All through his term as archbishop he refused to allow Edward to tax the clergy beyond certain levels, and withstood severe pressure to change his mind. In August 1295, he offered the king a tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues, less than Edward had hoped to collect from the clergy. Winchelsey did concede though that if the war with France, which <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> money was requested to fund, continued into the following year, then the clergy would be amenable to making further contributions.|$|E

5|$|Back in Arendelle, Anna (who has {{woken up}} from the spell) tried to track down a device known as a wishing star, which will {{have the power to}} bring her and Kristoff to {{wherever}} Elsa is. It was apparently the necklace Elsa had given Anna long ago, Elsa using it to bring Anna and Kristoff to Storybrooke. However, the Spell of Shattered Sight had already begun, and the only ones immune to it were Elsa, Emma, and Anna (Anna because it was already used on her a while ago). Tracking down a note written by Elsa and Anna's mother right before her death, the three bring it to Ingrid. It reads that Gerda forgave Ingrid for all that had transpired and still loved her, Ingrid realizing this <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> prophecy meant by regaining her sister's love. Realizing {{there is no point in}} killing the town now, the Snow Queen kills herself using the mirror, which deactivates the curse, though a bit of it remained in Storybrooke, reinstating the town line, making it impossible to return to town if you are to leave it.|$|E

Welsh referee Clive Norling had given only thirteen penalties, ensuring the continuity needed by sides with the attacking flair of France and Australia.

However, Amarnath's string of poor scores with the bat cost India the services of another specialist batsman, who could have at least reduced the margins of defeat.|$|E
