5|$|A 1985 {{government}} committee, led by State Secretary Per Arne Watle, {{recommended that}} more route be flown by both Braathens SAFE and SAS, and that additional airlines {{be allowed to}} start other routes. On 5 September 1985, Braathens SAFE applied for the route Trondheim – Bodø – Harstad/Narvik – Tromsø and Tromsø–Longyearbyen. SAS had stated that it <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> <b>with</b> them if other airlines started flying international routes they did not, and on 17 October Braathens SAFE also applied for the routes Bergen–Stavanger–Paris, Bergen–Stavanger–Manchester, Oslo–Stavanger–Brussels and Trondheim–Bergen–Newcastle. The applications were rejected and it was agreed upon that SAS would retain all rights to fly internationally between Oslo, Bergen, Stavanger, Gothenburg, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Århus.|$|E
5|$|Buddy {{returned}} {{home and told}} Fischer to apologize to Cristina if he had offended her, and {{to tell her that}} they should be friends. It is not known if he took his father's advice, but according to one of Fischer's friends, Cisneros continued to call him after her meeting with his father. One of his friends stated that Fischer said Cisneros had offered him US$500 to get back with her daughter, but he refused. Fischer grew angry at Cisneros's insistence that he rekindle his relationship with Cristina and eventually called her and told her to stop. Once Fischer's senior year started, he began to date a new girl, Marianela Caballero of San Luis Potosí, Mexico. He invited her to the homecoming dance, but they did not date for their first semester because Marianela did not want any commitments. However, by the start of their second semester, they began dating. Around that same time, Cristina also started dating another boy. Fischer told his friends that he <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> <b>with</b> Cristina dating other men.|$|E

But since it's a bunch of suits—who are actually going against their own artist's wishes—I have absolutely no problem with it." ...|$|E

500|$|Just {{minutes after}} the game ended, Appalachian State {{students}} began celebrating on the two main streets in Boone, North Carolina: King Street and Rivers Street. The group eventually advanced to Kidd Brewer Stadium, Appalachian State's home field, and tore {{down one of the}} goalposts. The students proceeded to carry the goalpost over a mile before depositing it in the front yard of the school's chancellor, Kenneth E. Peacock. He <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> <b>with</b> this, saying [...] "as good as today was for Appalachian State, they can take it up there and put it down. I can't wait to get there and see it." [...] Several students jumped nude into the duck pond behind ASU's dining hall, a campus tradition for celebrating big football victories. When the team returned to their stadium in buses at 11:00p.m., they were greeted by a crowd of thousands of students and fans. It took the team 20minutes to get from their buses to the locker room due to the crowd. The celebration in Boone was not limited to Appalachian State's campus; the Boone Mall was [...] "flooded" [...] with cars, and a sports apparel shop carrying ASU gear, Sports Fanatic, reported that sales were seven times higher than normal.|$|E
500|$|... "Fresh Blood" [...] {{featured}} the final guest appearance by Sterling K. Brown as the vampire hunter Gordon Walker. The character's story arc {{for the season}} {{was intended to be}} longer, but Brown's commitments to the Lifetime Television series Army Wives limited his return to only two appearances. The episode was [...] "really hard" [...] for the actor; though he <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> <b>with</b> the character dying, the idea of Gordon turning an innocent girl into a vampire was [...] "horrific" [...] to him. Although Gordon's actions in previous episodes were questionable, Brown had always believed the character to be [...] "ultimately good". On this change, Brown commented, [...] "His endgame is to kill Sam, and anyone else who has to experience detrimental effects because of that is not a concern of his. That was tough for me to process and get on board with." [...] However, series creator Eric Kripke reasoned that the character was now a monster and should follow his instincts instead of logic. The writer of [...] "Fresh Blood", Sera Gamble, also penned Gordon's initial episode and helped Kripke conceptualize the character. She felt that she [...] "lucked out" [...] in being able to write the character's final appearance, and found there to be [...] "something so satisfying about turning him into a vampire and chopping his head off with a razor wire".|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the whole second season, Goldman wrote that [...] "Their was [...] some {{complaints}} that the season finale was a bit too rushed, with a lot of information offered all at once. Yet while that's a bit valid, it's also an exciting and surprising finale, that actually offers some bigger shocks than season 1." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a mostly positive review, praising the reveal of Beaver as the murderer while being slightly critical of his reveal as Veronica's rapist. He wrote that [...] "as twists go, this was a good one" [...] and that [...] "Kyle Gallner makes the transition from goofy, kind of pathetic little brother to insane mastermind quite well—the circles under his eyes, specifically, which seemed to indicate anxiety before suddenly indicated darkness and insanity when seen in a new light." [...] Regarding the rape reveal, the reviewers wrote that [...] "On a narrative level, I <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> <b>with</b> it...it's still a big problem in an emotional sense. In general, rape is a difficult subject, and to see it used as a plot device creates problems on its own." [...] Kaiser summed up his review by writing, [...] "'Not Pictured' acts as an effective capstone for a chaotic season. Sure, it doesn't entirely work, but overall, it gets the job done with emotion and flair." ...|$|E

Her American editor pointed out that the word jumper – British for pullover sweater – means a kind of dress in American. She had had no idea.

2500|$|Affleck {{replaced}} Edward Norton, who {{had joined}} the project in September2007, but when the start of production was delayed due to Pitt's departure, a scheduling conflict developed for Norton with Leaves of Grass, which he was committed to film for Tim Blake Nelson early in 2008. Norton asked Universal Pictures if he could be replaced, and a deal was struck between the studio and the Endeavor Talent Agency (which represents Norton and Affleck) to enable Norton to leave the production amicably. Crowe had partly been attracted to the project because of Norton's involvement, but he and Affleck had [...] "so many touchstones in common" [...] he <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> <b>with</b> the recasting. Affleck visited Capitol Hill to research his role, meeting with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Representative Anthony D. Weiner of New York's 9th congressional district, {{and members of the}} Massachusetts congressional delegation. [...] In an April 2009 interview to promote the film, Affleck said he drew on the experiences of Gary Condit, Elliot Spitzer, and John Edwards while preparing for the role.|$|E
2500|$|In {{replacing}} CBS, NBC traded {{a circus}} for a seminar. Reese said [...] "Curt Gowdy was its guy (1966–75), and didn't want Dizzy Dean – too overpowering. Curt was nice, but worried about mistakes. Diz and I just laughed." [...] Falstaff Brewery hyped Dean as Gowdy in return said [...] "I said, 'I can't do [...] "Wabash Cannonball." [...] Our styles clash --" [...] then came Pee Wee Reese. Gowdy added by {{saying about the}} pairing between him and Reese, [...] "They figured he <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> <b>with</b> me, and they'd still have their boy." [...] To many, baseball meant CBS's 1955–64 Game of the Week thoroughbred. A year later, NBC bought ABC's variant of a mule so to speak. [...] "We had the Series and All-Star Game. 1966–1968's Game meant exclusivity", said NBC Sports head Carl Lindemann, who added that [...] " [...] Chet Simmons and liked him [...] with the Sox and football" [...] also, getting two network sports {{for the price of}} one. As his analyst, Gowdy wanted his friend Ted Williams. NBC's lead sponsor, Chrysler declined the idea when Williams, a Sears spokesman, was pictured putting stuff in a Ford truck.|$|E

60|$|On a fine {{afternoon}} {{towards the}} end of the following month Captain Brisket and Mr. Duckett sat outside the Swan and Bottle Inn, Holemouth, a small port forty miles distant from Biddlecombe.

60|$|The day <b>was</b> <b>fine,</b> <b>with</b> {{the wind}} in the right direction, and soon they came to the end of Marsh Lake, which is fifteen miles long, and heavily fringed on all sides with timber and brush.

6000|$|Their {{eyes met}} in the briefest flash of a glance, then both turned their faces aside. Thus averted, one from the other, they made talk.

Her pose <b>was</b> <b>fine.</b> <b>With</b> her head thrown back, the roundness of her throat ran finely down to the bosom which swelled above the pile of books held by her straight arms. He looked at her. Their lips smiled curiously. She put back her throat {{as if she were}} drinking. They felt the blood beating madly in their necks. Then, suddenly breaking into a slight trembling, she turned round and left the room.|$|E

60|$|The {{first night}} at sea <b>was</b> <b>fine,</b> <b>with</b> bright moonlight, {{and a soft}} wind on the quarter that carried them pleasantly over the {{rippling}} sea, and everything was so tranquil and captivating that no one felt inclined to go to rest. Karlsefin sat beside the helm, guiding the ship and telling sagas {{to the group of}} friends who stood, sat, or reclined on the deck and against the bulwarks of the high poop. He repeated long pieces of poetry, descriptive of the battles and adventures of their viking forefathers, and also gave them occasional pieces of his own composing, in reference to surrounding circumstances and the enterprise in which they were then embarked,--for Karlsefin was himself a skald or poet, although he pretended not to great attainments in that way.|$|E
60|$|He saw {{the girl}} in the morning. She met him {{at the door of the}} dining-room, and he easily found in her shy, proud manner, and her pure, cold beauty, the {{temperament}} and physiognomy of the child he remembered. She was tall and slim, and she held herself straight without stiffness; her face <b>was</b> <b>fine,</b> <b>with</b> a straight nose, and a decided chin, and a mouth of the same sweetness which looked from her still, gray eyes; her hair, of the average brown, had a rough effect of being quickly tossed into form, which pleased him; as she slipped down the room before him to place him at table he saw that she was, as it were, involuntarily, unwillingly graceful. She made him think of a wild sweetbrier, of a hermit-thrush; but, if there were this sort of poetic suggestion in Cynthia's looks, her acts were of plain and honest prose, such as giving Westover the pleasantest place and the most intelligent waitress in the room.|$|E
60|$|Each August, till he was six, he {{was sent}} for health, and the assuagement of his {{hereditary}} instincts, up to a Scotch shooting, where he carried many birds in a very tender manner. Once he was compelled by Fate to remain there nearly a year; and we went up ourselves to fetch him home. Down the long avenue toward the keeper's cottage we walked: It was high autumn; there had been frost already, for the ground <b>was</b> <b>fine</b> <b>with</b> red and yellow leaves; and presently we saw himself coming; professionally questing among those leaves, and preceding his dear keeper with the businesslike self-containment of a sportsman; not too fat, glossy as a raven's wing, swinging his ears and sporran like a little Highlander. We approached him silently. Suddenly his nose went up from its imagined trail, and he came rushing at our legs. From him, as a garment drops from a man, dropped all his strange soberness; he became in a single instant one fluttering eagerness. He leaped from life to life in one bound, without hesitation, without regret. Not one sigh, not one look back, not the faintest token of gratitude or regret at leaving those good people who had tended him for a whole year, buttered oat-cake for him, allowed him to choose each night exactly where he would sleep. No, he just marched out beside us, as close as ever he could get, drawing us on in spirit, and not even attending to the scents, until the lodge gates were passed.|$|E
