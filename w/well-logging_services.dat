40|$|Well-logging plays a very {{important}} role in the petroleum industry. It is an eye of oil industry as it provides detailed geological information of drilled holes which is very cost effective. It enables quantitative estimation of hydrocarbon reserves through its openhole services. The cased hole and production logging services are of immense help during exploitation and development stages of oil/gas fields. The geophysical well logging technique has also wide applica-tions in subsurface mineral, geothermal and ground water exploration. Of late it has found application in ‘Coal-Bed Methane ’ (CBM) exploration, which has opened up new opportunities. Because if its immense importance in subsurface hydrocarbon and mineral exploration the geophysical well-logging technique has seen tremendous development in the field of instrumentation and interpretation. This has become possible due to the advancement in science and technology aided by computerisation. The present paper (teals with the initiation of well-logging technique that has seen tremen-dous development in the field of instrumentation and interpretation. It also covers the initiation of <b>well-logging</b> <b>services</b> in India and the present state-of-the-art. Its future application is briefly discussed...|$|E
