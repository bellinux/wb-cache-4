5|$|Since its inception, {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars have been poured into the Auburn Dam project, but no further work has been done since the 1980s. However, the Bureau of Reclamation continues to list the Auburn as a considered alternative for the future of its Auburn-Folsom South Unit project. As of now, massive evidence of the dam's construction still remain in the North Fork American River canyon, specifically the excavations for the abutments and spillway, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of increased erosion.|$|E
5|$|After {{the victory}} over Mattau the {{governor}} {{decided to make}} use of the soldiers to cow other recalcitrant villages, starting with Taccariang, who had previously killed both VOC employees and Sinkan villagers. The villagers first fought with the Sinkanders who were acting as a vanguard, but on receiving a volley from the Dutch musketeers the Taccariang warriors turned and fled. The VOC forces entered the village unopposed, and burnt it to the ground. From Taccariang they moved on to Soulang, where they arrested warriors who had participated in the 1629 massacre of sixty Dutch soldiers and torched their houses. The last stop on the campaign trail was Tevorang, which had previously sheltered wanted men from other villages. This time the governor decided to use diplomacy, offering gifts and assurances of friendship, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of resistance left implicit. The Tevorangans took the hint, and offered no opposition to Dutch rule.|$|E
50|$|Some Filipinos {{also work}} as {{fisherman}} on Indonesian waters. However, some have fished illegally and have faced a crackdown <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> of deportation by Indonesian authorities.|$|R
50|$|The factor 1/√(4&pi;) {{is chosen}} {{so that the}} Gaussian will have a total {{integral}} of 1, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> that constant functions are not changed by the Weierstrass transform.|$|R
50|$|ElGamal {{encryption}} is probabilistic, {{meaning that}} a single plaintext can be encrypted to many possible ciphertexts, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> that a general ElGamal encryption produces a 2:1 expansion in size from plaintext to ciphertext.|$|R
5|$|The fifth Volume begins {{three months}} later. The family's rocketship has set {{down in a}} frozen region of a planet, where Dengo meets with members of The Last Revolution, a radical anti-war group, who wish to use Hazel as a pawn in their {{campaign}} against Landfall and Wreath. Meanwhile, as Marko and Prince Robot IV struggle to maintain their alliance while in pursuit of their kidnapped loved ones, Alana and Yuma both deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of {{their use of the}} drug Fadeway. By the end of the arc, Dengo has turned on the revolutionaries, but is himself killed by Prince Robot IV, who is united with his son. Marko and Alana are reunited, but Hazel and Klara are relegated to a Landfallian prison. The Brand, Gwendolyn and Sophie have acquired the elixir, but the Brand is killed in the process.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} structure is alluded to in Legea minții, {{which is about}} discovering one's true calling. The plot follows its protagonist, a scholarly priest {{by the name of}} Andrei Pascu, as he finds himself in his work as a missionary of religion and cultural nationalism, despite being set back by poverty and revisited by his worldly past. Similar themes are developed elsewhere. In Popa Man, a lapsed priest and smuggler is suddenly confronted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of his actions, and destroys himself with drink. In Stana, named after its female protagonist, a war invalid is a passive witness to his wife's moral decay. When he dies, his wooden leg serves as a haunting reminder of his virtues, driving Stana to despair.|$|E
25|$|Personal responsibility, self-reliance, {{and mastery}} – We accept {{that we are}} the masters of our own destiny. We make {{decisions}} and live <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of them. When a problem needs to be fixed, or an opportunity exploited, we take the initiative to learn the required skills to get it done.|$|E
5000|$|Marsh also {{originated}} [...] "discontinuity systematics", {{the idea}} that there are boundaries between different animals that cannot be crossed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> that there would be discontinuities in the history of life and limits to common ancestry.|$|R
50|$|Played in Galati March 16-24. This year's tournament was {{expanded}} to ten teams {{to try to}} avoid hostilities between China and South Korea. China and Denmark were both elevated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> that four teams would be relegated.|$|R
30|$|Dilemma 1 : Contemporary {{art museums}} define {{themselves}} through {{the architecture of}} their buildings. The architectural works often outshine <b>the</b> collections <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> that <b>the</b> building’s operating costs exceed the budget for exhibitions and purchase of new artworks.|$|R
25|$|The church {{continued}} to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of the Native residential school issue. In 2005, the church welcomed the Agreement in Principle {{announced by the}} Government of Canada and the Assembly of First Nations, which outlined a comprehensive resolution package for former students of Indian Residential Schools; and the following year, the church agreed to sign the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-2000s, Englehart {{turned his}} 1980 novel, The Point Man, into Book Zero {{for a series}} {{concerning}} its hero, Max August. The first sequel, The Long Man, was published in 2009, The Plain Man in 2011, and The Arena Man in 2013. In the series, Max became immortal in 1985 and is dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> two decades later in real time.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent stories {{focus on}} the {{discovery}} of new life and sociological and political relationships with alien cultures, as well as exploring the human condition. Several new species are introduced as recurring antagonists, including the Ferengi, the Cardassians, and the Borg. Throughout their adventures, Picard and his crew are often forced to face and live <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of difficult choices.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{difference is that}} the elements of a POVM are not necessarily orthogonal, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> that <b>the</b> number of elements in the POVM, n, can be larger than the dimension, N, of the Hilbert space they act in.|$|R
50|$|The Elements {{are mainly}} a systematization of earlier {{knowledge}} of geometry. It {{is assumed that}} its superiority over earlier treatments was recognized, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> {{that there was little}} interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.|$|R
5000|$|In William Shakespeare's tragedy, Othello, the {{antagonist}} Iago {{has been}} noted by some literary critics as being archetypal in adhering to Machiavelli's ideals by advancing himself through machination and duplicity <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> of causing <b>the</b> demise of both Othello and Desdemona.|$|R
25|$|The best {{representation}} of {{this difference is}} e=−1; s=4.877000, which differs more than 20% from e=−1; s=4.000000. In extreme cases, all significant digits of precision can be lost (although gradual underflow ensures that the result will not be zero unless the two operands were equal). This cancellation illustrates the danger in assuming {{that all of the}} digits of a computed result are meaningful. Dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of these errors is a topic in numerical analysis; see also Accuracy problems.|$|E
25|$|Each episode also {{amounts to}} a {{confidence}} game played upon the viewers {{through the use of}} misdirection and hidden plot details that are revealed {{at the end of the}} story. Not all cons depicted are successful, and some episodes focus on the characters dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of their actions. However, even if a con does fail, main characters usually come out on top in some way or other...or, at times, nothing is gained but nothing lost, either.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time the {{increasing}} number of internal violent conflicts in Africa, Asia and Europe (Balkans) resulted in concepts of national and international security failing to reflect the challenges of the post Cold War security environment whilst the failure of neoliberal development models to generate growth, particularly in Africa, or to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of complex new threats (such as HIV and climate change) reinforced the sense that international institutions and states were not organised to address such problems in an integrated way.|$|E
50|$|During {{the first}} Battle of Villmergen in 1656 and {{again during the}} {{occupation}} of the region by the French Revolutionary Army in 1799, the nuns were obliged to flee. On both occasions the abbey was completely pillaged, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> that there are few treasures left.|$|R
50|$|The Bill was 'fast-tracked' through parliament, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> {{that it was}} not {{possible}} for the Joint Committee on Human Rights to scrutinise it. The House of Lords Constitutional Committee, moreover, 'concluded that the government had not advanced a good rationale for the Bill to be fast-tracked'.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{highlights the}} conceptual limitations of Holbrook’s Nostalgia Index: it conflates <b>the</b> cause (nostalgia) <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> (preference); {{it does not}} consider nostalgia as an emotion; and it opposes the past to the present and future. Hence, Holbrook’s Nostalgia Index measures belief in decline, not nostalgia proneness...|$|R
25|$|Harmful {{cultural}} {{practices such as}} female genital mutilation (FGM) also cause girls and women to face health risks. Millions of females are estimated to have undergone FGM, which involves partial or total removal of the external female genitalia for non-medical reasons. It is estimated that 92.5 million females over 10 years of age in Africa are living <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of FGM. Of these, 12.5 million are girls between 10 and 14 years of age. Each year, about three million girls in Africa are subjected to FGM.|$|E
25|$|On {{the late}} night live talk show, Este (Evening), on the {{previously}} besieged MTV, Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány was faced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of his actions, and the protester's demands, {{when he read}} their petition which they managed {{to hand over the}} previous day. He replied that it was not just himself, but everybody who had lied, and he would not resign. He said he was committed to pushing through his austerity measures in any circumstances, without the possibility of even a minor change to it.|$|E
25|$|Willy was {{the sole}} carer of his senile mother, and desperate to get the funds {{to pay for her}} {{placement}} at a nursing home, he decides to con Arthur into signing the fund money into various accounts, and then leaves Arthur to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> when the money is declared missing. For a second time, Arthur is faced with a police investigation and with all the evidence stacked against him, he is soon arrested and ends the year behind bars. This is too much for Arthur, who is unable to face the prospect of serving a prison sentence for a crime he didn't commit, and upon his imprisonment he suffers a mental breakdown and refuses any contact with his family.|$|E

50|$|Ewe {{music has}} many genres. One is Agbekor, which relates to songs and music around war.

25|$|Many {{role-playing}} games allow {{players to}} play as an evil character. Although robbing and murdering indiscriminately may {{make it easier to}} get money, there are usually consequences in that other characters will become uncooperative or even hostile towards the player. Thus, these games allow players to make moral choices, but force players to live <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of their actions. Games often let the player control an entire party of characters. However, if winning is contingent upon the survival of a single character, then that character effectively becomes the player's avatar. An example of this would be in Baldur's Gate, where if the character created by the player dies, the game ends and a previous save needs to be loaded.|$|E
25|$|The {{constraints}} adopted have definite implications on {{the stories}} told. An Earthman may {{fall in love}} with and wed an alien princess like Burroughs' John Carter of Mars does, but unlike Carter {{will never be able to}} found a dynasty. Nor will he be able to flit from Earth to the stars and back; an interstellar voyage takes months of subjective time and many years in objective time - as dictated by the time dilation of the Theory of relativity - rendering any decision to leave his own stellar system a difficult one, fraught <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of being cut off from his friends, family and native culture for decades, during which they will age or develop much more than he will himself. De Camp somewhat mitigates the problem by postulating the development of longevity treatments that extend human lifespans to two centuries. Nonetheless, the effect is that space travel primarily attracts marginal and unattached members of society such as adventurers, entrepreneurs, con-men, utopian idealists, emigrants, and various admixtures thereof – or official representatives such as explorers, diplomats, and bureaucrats. Sterling, selfless heroes are in short supply.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, Buchloh draws {{attention}} to Beuys's fictionalisation of his own biography, which he sees as symptomatic of a dangerous cultural tendency of disavowing a traumatic past and retreating into the realms of myth and esoteric symbolism. Buchloh attacks Beuys for his failure to acknowledge and engage with Nazism, the Holocaust, and their implications. Secondly, Buchloh criticizes Beuys for displaying an inability or reluctance to engage <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> {{of the work of}} Marcel Duchamp. That is, a failure to acknowledge the framing function of the art institution and the inevitable dependence upon such institutions to create meaning for art objects. If Beuys championed art's power to foster political transformation, he nevertheless failed to acknowledge the limits imposed upon such aspirations by the art museum and dealership networks that served somewhat less utopian ambitions. For Buchloh, rather than acknowledging the collective and contextual formation of meaning, Beuys instead attempted to prescribe and control the meanings of his art, and often in the form of dubious esoteric or symbolic codings. Buchloh's critique has been developed by a number of commentators such as Stefan Germer and Rosalind Krauss.|$|E
40|$|Becoming {{unemployed}} has {{negative effects}} on life satisfaction; a transition from unemployment to employment, however, has only small positive effects. This asymmetry indicates a potential omitted variable bias in previous empirical happiness studies, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequence</b> of underesti-mated effects of unemployment on life satisfaction. There are also gender-specific effects of asymmetry...|$|R
