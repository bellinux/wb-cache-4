5|$|The booked service allowed {{two options}} of fees. The Transit Booking System, {{available}} online, allowing customers {{who do not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> in queue to pay an additional 15% over the regular tolls, guaranteeing a specific day for transit and crossing the canal in 18 hours or less. ACP sells 24 of these daily slots up to 365 days in advance. The second choice was high priority transit. Since 2006, ACP has available a 25th slot, sold through the Transit Slot Auction to the highest bidder. The main customers of the Transit Booking System are cruise ships, containerships, vehicle carriers, and non-containerized cargo vessels.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1996, Deal {{changed the}} name of the group back to the Breeders, {{originally}} with almost the same line-up as the Amps. Until then, Deal had been waiting for Wiggs and Kelley to rejoin the Breeders and record a new album together, and had held back from reforming the Breeders out of respect for them. In May 1996, Wiggs revealed that she would not be involved in any immediate Breeders activity; Kelley also chose to stay in Saint Paul, to be close to her rehabilitation facility. Deal then decided that she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> any longer to reform the group, partly because the Breeders' repertoire was larger than the Amps', thereby allowing longer concerts. Deal added violinist Carrie Bradley (who had played on the Breeders' Pod album), and with Macpherson, Lerma, and Farley, played some shows in 1996 with Primus.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, it {{was decided}} to make Type-0 a PSP exclusive, {{cancelling}} the mobile version of the game as the developers did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for mobile technology to reach a level which could handle their full vision for the game. Full development began that year by the same team who developed Crisis Core, but was again slowed as most of them were completing work on The 3rd Birthday. Because of these conflicting projects, Type-0 came close to being cancelled outright. Between 2009 and 2011, the title was changed to distance it from Final Fantasy XIII, since after the platform change the two games had little in common other than their shared mythos. One of the titles considered and rejected was Final Fantasy Live, referring to the game's multiplayer element. The new title, Final Fantasy Type-0, was intended to indicate the game's separation from the main series. It was also the beginning of an alternative numbering system parallel to the main series. The game made its first official public appearance under the new title at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in Tokyo, along with a new trailer that was released to the public on January 27, 2011.|$|E

25|$|The battle {{eventually}} became a waiting game in which the Muslims {{did not want to}} attack an army that could possibly be numerically superior and wanted the Franks to come out into the open.

25|$|Bryant was {{assigned}} by the Lakers {{to play in the}} 1997 NBA Summer League to improve as a team player and learn where to send the ball when he drew double teams. The following season, Bryant was voted as a starter in the 1998 All-Star Game though he was a reserve on the Lakers. The Lakers struggled after the All-Star break, losing seven of their first 12 games, and Bryant had a stretch where he made only 30 of 100 shots. O'Neal wanted a championship immediately, and he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for Bryant to mature as a player. Harris thought the NBA and its television broadcaster, National Broadcasting Company (NBC), were overexposing Bryant and that he became more of a one-on-one player after the break. Bryant's playing time became reduced. The Lakers were eliminated in the 1998 playoffs in the conference finals after they were swept by the Jazz, 4–0.|$|E
25|$|While {{the canal}} {{expansion}} was being completed, and considering the high operational {{costs of the}} vessels, the long queues that occur during the high season December through to March (sometimes up to a seven-day delay), and the high value {{of some of the}} cargo transported through the canal, the ACP has implemented a Transit Booking System and Transit Slot Auction to allow a better management of the scarce capacity available and to increase the level of service offered to the shipping companies. The scheme gives users two choices: (1) transit by order of arrival on a first-come, first-served basis, as the canal historically has operated; or (2) booked service for a fee—a congestion charge. The booked service allows two options of fees. The Transit Booking System, available online, allowing customers who do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> in queue to pay an additional 15% over the regular tolls, guaranteeing a specific day for transit and crossing the canal in 18 hours or less.

500|$|If {{the regular}} army showed {{contempt}} for the masses belonging to the SA, many stormtroopers returned the feeling, seeing the army as insufficiently committed to the National Socialist revolution.

500|$|When Cornwallis {{arrived in}} Trenton {{with the main}} army, he called a council of war {{as to whether or}} not he should {{continue}} to attack. Cornwallis' quartermaster general, William Erskine, urged Cornwallis to strike right away, saying [...] "If Washington is the General I take him to be, his army will not be found there in the morning." [...] But James Grant disagreed, and argued that there was no way for the Americans to retreat, and that the British troops were worn out, and that it would be better for them to attack in the morning after they had rested. Cornwallis did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> until morning, but he decided that it would be better than sending his troops out to attack in the dark. Cornwallis said, [...] "We've got the old fox safe now. We'll go over and bag him in the morning." [...] Cornwallis then moved his army to a hill north of Trenton for the night.|$|E
500|$|In February 2010, Robyn {{announced}} {{in an interview}} with Swedish magazine [...] that she would release three albums during 2010. She noted that it had been five years since she released her last effort, Robyn (2005), and that she had not been in the studio [...] "properly" [...] since then. She explained that she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> until all the songs had been recorded; she rather wanted to split up the songs in three different releases. She chose to name the trilogy Body Talk after a gay club in London that a friend of hers owns, commenting that the title [...] "tickles [...] imagination". In June 2010, the first in the trilogy, Body Talk Pt. 1, was released, and was quickly followed by the announcement of Body Talk Pt. 2. The album's lead single, [...] "Hang with Me" [...] and the track [...] "Indestructible", were among the first songs to be recorded for the trilogy. Robyn said that [...] "we saved them for later because I knew they would be singles, or could be singles, and I wanted them to get that chance." [...] "Hang with Me" [...] was originally recorded in 2002, by Klas Åhlund's then-wife, Paola Bruna, for her album Stockcity Girl.|$|E
500|$|Stage 9 was the Tour's toughest {{stage to}} that point, with seven climbs during the [...] parcours. Voeckler, {{who entered the}} day in 19th place a minute and 29 seconds down in the overall classification, made a high-powered {{breakaway}} with Luis León Sánchez, Sandy Casar, Juan Antonio Flecha (all of them stage winners {{in one or more}} previous Tours) and Johnny Hoogerland. Some [...] from the finish line, a car from France Télévisions sideswiped Flecha and Hoogerland, the two front riders at the time, sending both off their bicycles and Hoogerland crashing into a barbed-wire fence. After a few uncertain minutes while he appeared to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for Flecha and Hoogerland to rejoin them, Voeckler then drove the breakaway hard. With prior race leader Thor Hushovd well back, the yellow jersey was bound to change hands, and Voeckler's time gap over the main field at the time of Flecha and Hoogerland's crash made him very likely to be the rider to take it. Voeckler's efforts left him unable to sprint {{at the end of the}} stage, and Sánchez won, but his near four-minute time gap over the peloton gave him the yellow jersey by a minute and 49 seconds over Sánchez and two minutes and 26 seconds against the best-placed overall favorite, Cadel Evans in third place.|$|E
