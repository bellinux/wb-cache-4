40|$|In this study, the {{inability}} to in a future meet the electricity demand and the urge to change the consumption behavior considered. In a smart grid context there are several possible ways to do this. Means include ways to increase the consumer’s awareness, add energy storages or build smarter homes which can control the appliances. To be able to implement these, indications on how the future consumption will be could be useful. Therefore we look further into how a framework for short-term consumption predictions can be created using electricity consumption data in relation to external factors. To do this a literature study is made {{to see what kind}} of methods that are relevant and which qualities is interesting to look at in order to choose a good prediction method. Case Based Reasoning seemed to be able to be suitable method. This method was examined further and built using relational databases. After this the method was tested and evaluated using datasets and evaluation methods CV, MBE and MAPE, which have previously been used in the domain of consumption prediction. The result was compared to the results of the <b>winning</b> <b>methods</b> in the ASHRAE competition. The CBR method was expected to perform better than what it did, and still not as good as the <b>winning</b> <b>methods</b> from the ASHRAE competition.

5000|$|In 1907, Mrs. Goold persuaded Vere Goold {{to go to}} {{the casino}} of Monte Carlo. She thought she had a <b>winning</b> <b>method</b> for the {{gambling}} tables.

However, the Goolds soon were without funds. At the casino, they met a wealthy Swedish woman, Emma Levin, the widow of a Stockholm broker.

50|$|The {{long history}} of the study has its origins in a game played between Richard Fenton and William Potter in 1875. From the {{position}} shown to the left, the game continued 1.Rxh3 Kxh3 2.Kc6 Rxa5 3.b7 Ra6+ and the players agreed a draw. However, as Johannes Zukertort {{pointed out in the}} City of London Chess Magazine, 1875, White could have won with 4.Kc5 (not 4.Kb5 Ra1 when White cannot promote the pawn because of 5...Rb1+) 4...Ra5+ 5. Kc4 Ra4+ 6. Kc3 (or 6. Kb3 Ra1 7. Kb2) 6...Ra3+ 7. Kb2, and White will promote the pawn when the queen versus rook endgame is a theoretical win (this <b>winning</b> <b>method</b> had earlier been demonstrated in a study by Josef Kling and Bernhard Horwitz published in The Chess Player, September 1853).Upon Potter's death in March 1895, G.E. Barbier published a position in his Glasgow Weekly Citizen chess column of April 27, 1895, which he claimed to have occurred in Fenton-Potter. In fact, he had misremembered the game, and the position he published (shown to the right) had never arisen.
