25|$|It will {{hardly be}} disputed, I suppose, that the {{department}} of literature in which the Eastern writers stand highest is poetry. And I certainly never met with any orientalist who ventured to maintain that the Arabic and Sanscrit poetry could be compared to that of the great European nations. But when <b>we</b> <b>pass</b> from works of imagination to works in which facts are recorded and general principles investigated, the superiority of the Europeans becomes absolutely immeasurable. It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the Sanscrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgments used at preparatory schools in England. In every branch of physical or moral philosophy, the relative position of the two nations is nearly the same.|$|E

500|$|From its unveiling, Candaules was {{condemned}} {{by the press}} as a cynical combination of a pornographic picture and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and there was near-unanimous consensus that the picture was inappropriate for public exhibition. The Literary Gazette condemned the work as [...] "against decency and good taste", and Etty as tending in Candaules towards the type of [...] "debasing sensuality" [...] one would expect from a foreigner, not the [...] "purer" [...] British school of painting. The reviewer also criticised {{the theme of the}} painting, saying that [...] "as an academic study, the central figure of this group might be admissible; but, in [...] with the disgraceful story, it deserves to be warmly reprehended". La Belle Assemblée, one of Britain's most influential women's magazines, praised Etty's other exhibits at the Summer Exhibition but refused to review Candaules altogether, saying that [...] "to us the subject is so offensive that <b>we</b> <b>pass</b> it over". Even Alexander Gilchrist, generally one of Etty's strongest supporters, in his 1855 biography of Etty described Candaules as [...] "almost the only instance among Etty's works, of an undeniably disagreeable, not to say objectionable subject", while Sarah Burnage of the University of York says that [...] "it is perhaps hard to see the painting as anything but a deliberate attempt by the artist to shock and scandalise".|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{then joined}} with Dave McGrath of Lake Technology {{to produce a}} {{commercial}} version of the controller, the Lake Contour, essentially the same hardware but with different software. McGrath and Jackson acquired Clair Technologies LLC, the earlier joint venture. In turn, Dolby Laboratories bought Lake in 2004, Jackson staying with the product line to become {{vice president of the}} live sound division at Dolby, and by 2005 the loudspeaker controller was being used by seven of the ten top concert tours; 3,000 units had been built. Jackson moved back to Sydney in 2005 with Terri—his fourth wife—and their children, but in November he returned to the U.S. to accept his Parnelli Innovator Award. In 2006, the digital audio product was redesigned and introduced as the Dolby Lake Processor, capable of 4-in, 12-out operation as a loudspeaker crossover; 8-in, 8-out operation as a system equaliser; or a combination of 2 crossovers and 4 equalizers—the whole integrated with Smaart audio analysis software. A collaboration between Dolby and Swedish audio electronics company Lab.gruppen was announced in 2007; Jackson's technology would be incorporated into Lab.gruppen's Powered Loudspeaker Management (PLM) system. Two years later, Lab.gruppen acquired the Lake brand for further development of the PLM and other product lines. John Carey of Dolby said, [...] "As <b>we</b> <b>pass</b> the live sound torch to Lab.gruppen we are confident that they will continue to innovate and evolve the technology." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the {{character}} of [...] "Mr. Lovewell" [...] and the album came up while the band was attempting to figure out concepts for the record. According to lead singer Bart Millard [...] "we [...] were {{trying to come up}} with the concept for our next record. For some reason, the words 'love well' got stuck in my head". Millard elaborated that [...] "we're very good, as a nation, at loving well when a massive tragedy takes place... We all of a sudden become very unified, which is a great, great thing. But on a day-to-day basis, <b>we</b> <b>pass</b> up opportunities. We look the other way, or we try to ignore. So the idea of loving well is almost a kind of 'pay it forward' that revolves around the cross". With that general idea, MercyMe was going to name the album Love Well. However, the band decided to make a character that personifies the idea of 'loving well', and came up with the character of 'Mr. Lovewell', partly inspired by The Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Because of the character and the more diverse sound the album was going to have, the band felt the original name didn't fit and changed the album name to reflect the character of 'Mr. Lovewell'. Millard has described the character of 'Mr. Lovewell' as [...] "like Buddy the Elf meets Forrest Gump. He sees the good in everyone and knows his neighbors enough to know their needs. Mr. Lovewell may not be the next Billy Graham, but he’s changing the world each day in every little word and deed.” ...|$|E

500|$|The Big Lebowski {{was written}} {{around the same}} time as Barton Fink. When the Coen {{brothers}} wanted to make it, John Goodman was filming episodes for the Roseanne television program and Jeff Bridges was making the Walter Hill film Wild Bill. The Coens decided to make Fargo in the meantime. According to Ethan, [...] "the movie was conceived as pivoting around that relationship between the Dude and Walter", which sprang from the scenes between Barton Fink and Charlie Meadows in Barton Fink. They also {{came up with the idea}} of setting the film in contemporary L.A., because the people who inspired the story lived in the area. When Pete Exline told them about the homework in a baggie incident, the Coens thought that that was very Raymond Chandler and decided to integrate elements of the author's fiction into their script. Joel Coen cites Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye as a primary influence on their film, in the sense that The Big Lebowski [...] "is just kind of informed by Chandler around the edges". When they started writing the script, the Coens wrote only 40 pages and then let it sit for a while before finishing it. This is a normal writing process for them, because they often [...] "encounter a problem at a certain stage, <b>we</b> <b>pass</b> to another project, then we come back to the first script. That way we've already accumulated pieces for several future movies." [...] In order to liven up a scene that they thought was too heavy on exposition, they added an [...] "effete art-world hanger-on", known as Knox Harrington, late in the screenwriting process. In the original script, the Dude's car was a Chrysler LeBaron, as Dowd had once owned, but that car was not big enough to fit John Goodman so the Coens changed it to a Ford Torino.|$|E
