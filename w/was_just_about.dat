5|$|In 1907, Georges Passerieu {{broke away}} from a small leading group just before Douai because he knew he couldn't outsprint them if they all {{finished}} together. He was chased {{all the way to}} Roubaix by a Belgian, Cyrille van Hauwaert, and tension in the velodrome was high. The crowd heard that Passerieu had reached the stadium but nobody rode on to the track. The leader <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to ride in when a gendarme stepped into his path to check if his bicycle had the obligatory tax plate attached to it. Passerieu had already had a hard day and a shouting match broke out before he was allowed to continue.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Dawson {{had decided}} that the two French troops should take the lead into Ouistreham, {{followed}} by the six British troops. The French were unopposed apart from some mortar rounds and machine gun fire as they neared their objective. No. 8 French Troop occupied houses at the front and sides of the Casino strong point. An assault to capture the Casino was driven back. While {{this was going on}} the other French troop, No. 1, approached the Casino from the rear. Taking up firing positions they too started to engage the strong point but their fire had almost no effect. The French commander Capitaine de frégate Philippe Kieffer <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to order an all out assault by both troops, when reports that British amphibious tanks were in Ouistreham reached him. Sending a guide to bring one forward, the tank arrived in front of the Casino and proceeded to destroy the German gun emplacements. Within 30 minutes of the tanks' arrival, all the strong point guns were silenced and No. 1Troop had assaulted and captured the objective. With its capture the French Commandos were now in control of the western suburbs of Ouistreham.|$|E

After about 10 days she rounded the northern coast of Britain and made her way into the mid-Atlantic ocean. After another 20 days, U-66 headed for her new base at Lorient, on the French Atlantic cost, where the Keroman Submarine Base <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to begin construction and where the U-boat was based {{for the rest of her}} career.|$|E

And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E
25|$|After the {{critical}} and commercial success of Metroid Prime, Nintendo asked Retro Studios {{to produce a}} sequel. The developers decided against recycling {{the features of the}} first game while creating , and instead used new sound models, weapon effects, and art designs. A multiplayer component was also added to the game. On April 2003, Steve Barcia left the company. Michael Kelbaugh, who had worked with Nintendo for over 15 years, was appointed president, a job he retains to this date. Retro tried to include some extras, such as a hidden version of Super Metroid, but were halted by the short development time. Producer Kensuke Tanabe later revealed in an interview that the game <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> thirty percent complete three months before the strict deadline Nintendo had set for a release in the 2004 holiday season. The critical reception for Metroid Prime 2: Echoes was very positive, but earned some criticism on the game's high difficulty. Sales for Echoes were lower than the first Prime, with a total of 800,000 units.|$|E

25|$|Al-Tabari {{reports that}} al-Mahdi <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to promote Harun as heir {{apparent}} ahead of Musa when he died, and adds {{by way of}} corroboration another report that al-Mahdi set off for Masabadhan in a great hurry. However, it may be doubted that al-Mahdi at the time shared the reporter's subsequent knowledge of his imminent demise there, {{and none of the}} other reported circumstances of his death suggest that he was in a hurry to go anywhere. On the contrary, the sources in general make it clear that he had gone to Masabadhan for recreation, and they occasionally say so explicitly. Al-Tabari does say explicitly that envoys were sent to the provinces, where they obtained the oath of allegiance not only to al-Hadi as caliph but also to Harun as heir apparent (wali l-'ahd) (38). This was probably the first occasion on which Harun was so acknowledged. Harun himself, with the advice of al-Rabi', sent out these envoys, and all of this must have been presented to his brother on his return as a fait accompli.|$|E

500|$|Thus, {{when the}} action began {{and became a}} {{defensive}} rather than an offensive battle for the Russians, their heavy preponderance in artillery was wasted on a right wing that would never be attacked, while the French artillery did much to help win the battle. Toll and others would make attempts to cover up their mistakes in this deployment and later attempts by historians would compound the issue. Indeed, Clausewitz too complained about Toll's dispositions being so narrow and deep that needless losses were incurred from artillery fire. The Russian position therefore <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> [...] long with about 80,000 of the 1st Army {{on the right and}} 34,000 of the 2nd Army on the left.|$|E

500|$|After 27 {{months of}} {{serving in the}} army, Middleton got his first promotion, to corporal. [...] Promotions came very slowly, and {{occurred}} only when a position was vacated by someone else getting promoted or retiring. Shortly after his promotion on 10 June 1912, Corporal Middleton was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where {{he would have a}} chance to compete for an army commission. Here Middleton attended an intensive training course to prepare for the written examination required for a second lieutenant's commission. [...] Of the 300 civilians and enlisted men who took the exam, 56 of them passed and were commissioned. Middleton's score <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> {{in the middle of the}} passing scores. Almost all of those passing were college graduates, coming from schools such as Harvard, Yale, Virginia Military Institute, and Stanford.

500|$|Protest organizers, which {{consisted}} of a loose coalition of seven political parties including Al Wefaq and Wa'ad, named the march the largest in Bahrain's history. Associated Press, The Huffington Post, The New York Times and Voice of America estimated that there were over 100,000 participants. The New York Times described the number as [...] "astonishing", because Bahrain's total population is a little over 500,000. The BBC described the course of march as a [...] "sea of red and white flags". Other estimates varied between 30,000 and 200,000 participants. In their documentary film , Al Jazeera English stated, [...] "Bahrain held its largest march in history; the world media recorded {{nearly a quarter of}} all citizens in the streets". The BICI report mentioned that [...] "by many accounts more than 100,000 people were marching" [...] and that the number of protesters at Pearl Roundabout peaked at over 150,000.

500|$|Potemkin {{argued with}} Suvorov and Catherine herself, who were both anxious to assault Ochakov, which the Turks twice managed to supply by sea. Finally, on 6 December, the assault began and {{four hours later}} the city was taken, a coup for Potemkin. Nearly ten {{thousand}} Turks had been killed {{at a cost of}} (only) two-and-a-half thousand Russians. Catherine wrote that [...] "you [...] have shut the mouths of everyone... show magnanimity to your blind and empty-headed critics". Potemkin then visited the naval yard at Vitovka, founded Nikolayev, and traveled on to St. Petersburg, arriving in February 1789. In May he left once more for the front, having agreed contingency plans with Catherine should Russia be forced into war with either Prussia or the upstart Poland, which had recently successfully demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops from its territory. (Catherine herself <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to change favorites for the final time, replacing Dmitriev-Mamonov with Platon Zubov.) Back on the Turkish front, Potemkin advanced towards the fortress of Bender on the Dniester river.|$|E
500|$|Retro {{decided to}} make the game more {{challenging}} than Metroid Prime—which was supposed to familiarize players with the control scheme—and felt that [...] "with the second Prime, we had the ability or the freedom" [...] to do so. They wanted Echoes to be focused towards a hardcore audience by making the player [...] "always worried about his health", so more mini-bosses were added to provide unique boss fights. After the game's release, the developers admitted that it was more difficult to develop than they first imagined, and Michael Kelbaugh, Retro Studios' president, commented: [...] "We wanted to expand and add to the title, and not just slam out a sequel. Nintendo doesn't do things that way." [...] Retro tried to include some extras, such as a hidden version of Super Metroid, but were halted by the short development time.

Then he got another man to bear the banner, and there was again a hard fight. Kerthialfad smote this man too his death blow at once, and so on one after the other all who stood near him. Then Earl Sigurd called on Thorstein the son of Hall of Sida, to bear the banner, and Thorstein <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> to lift the banner, but then Asmund the White said, [...] "Don't bear the banner! For all they who bear it get their death." [...] "Hrafn the Red!" [...] called out Earl Sigurd, [...] "bear thou the banner." [...] "Bear thine own devil thyself," [...] {{answered}} Hrafn. Then the earl said, [...] "`Tis fittest that the beggar should bear the bag;'" [...] and with that he took the banner from the staff and put it under his cloak.

500|$|As the 1950 Detroit Tigers season started, Houtteman {{was on a}} high note, {{pitching}} all {{of spring}} training without allowing a walk. He won his tenth {{game of the season}} on June 28, 1950, and became the first pitcher to hit the 10-win mark alongside Bob Lemon. After the game, he told an Associated Press reporter that he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> convinced that Lady Luck had decided to give him a break after kicking him around for the past two or three years. Houtteman said, [...] "I've been having a pretty good year and it sure feels good after {{some of the things that}} have happened to me". A week into July, Houtteman notched his eleventh victory, and only lost five games, in a 6–1 win against the St. Louis Browns. Just a few days later, Houtteman was named to the All-Star roster alongside fellow Tigers including Ted Gray, George Kell and Hoot Evers. In the 1950 All-Star game, Houtteman pitched three innings and batted once. He allowed one earned run, three hits, and one walk, his one earned run coming in the ninth inning on a Ralph Kiner home run that made the game go to extra innings.|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, Lee {{spent over}} {{two and a}} half years writing To Kill a Mockingbird. The book was {{published}} on July 11, 1960. After rejecting the [...] "Watchman" [...] title, it was initially re-titled Atticus, but Lee renamed it [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird" [...] to reflect that the story went beyond just a character portrait. The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies. In 1964, Lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said, [...] "I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird.'...I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected." [...] Instead of a [...] "quick and merciful death", Reader's Digest Condensed Books chose the book for reprinting in part, which gave it a wide readership immediately.
