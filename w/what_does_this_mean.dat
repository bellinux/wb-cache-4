2500|$|<b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean</b> for the proof? The first clue {{means that}} a simple {{examination}} of the M-code on the tape will not reveal if a symbol 0 is ever printed by U+"M-code". A testing-machine might look for the appearance of DC {{in one of the}} strings of symbols that represent an instruction. But will this instruction ever be [...] "executed?" [...] Something has to [...] "run the code" [...] to find out. This something can be a machine, or it can be lines in a formal proof, i.e. Lemma #1.|$|E
2500|$|What is {{the meaning}} of [...] "Acher {{destroyed}} the plants"? Of him scripture says: [...] "Do not let your mouth make your flesh sin". <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean?</b> Acher saw that Metatron happened to be granted authority to sit while he record the merits of Israel, and he said: [...] "We have been taught that in heaven there is no sitting.... Perhaps there are — God forbid! — two supreme powers". They brought him to Metatron and they smote him with sixty bands of fire. They said to Metatron: [...] "When you saw him, why did you not stand up before him?" [...] Then authority was granted Metatron to erase the merits of Acher. Then a heavenly voice was heard: [...] "'Repent, O backsliding children!' except for Acher." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{announcement}} {{came as a}} {{shock to}} Italians and non-Italians alike. Umberto Eco expressed delight that the award had been given to someone who [...] "does not belong to the traditional academic world." [...] However, 86-year-old Italian literary critic Carlo Bo was mystified: [...] "I must be too old to understand. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean?</b> That everything changes, even literature has changed." [...] Fo's fellow Italian laureate Rita Levi-Montalcini expressed bewilderment when asked for her thoughts and wondered if Fo were Italian. Mario Luzi, a poet regarded as a likely next Italian recipient at the time, slammed the phone down on one reporter: [...] "I'll say only this. I've just about had it up to here!" [...] Reaction from the English-speaking world was also particularly fierce, with representatives from many English-speaking countries regarding Fo's work as unfashionable and outdated, belonging to the 1970s and 1980s. U.S. playwright Tony Kushner, however, expressed his approval, writing: [...] " [...] has dedicated his genius to making everything he touches debatable. [...] is brave and perhaps even reckless because it subjects Literature, and prizes, and Newspapers of Record, to the Fo effect". When he accepted the award, Fo presented a specially devised piece called Contra jogulatores obloquentes (Against Jesters of Irreverent Speech) alongside some paintings, with this later being described as [...] "undoubtedly the most flamboyantly theatrical and comical acceptance speech ever seen at the Swedish Academy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Catherick's undisguised {{contempt}} for Sir Percival plainly extended {{to his mother}} as well. She had referred with the bitterest sarcasm to the great family he had descended from--"especially by the mother's side." [...] <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean?</b> ...|$|R
60|$|The {{four young}} {{people looked at}} each other. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean?</b> Had the {{servants}} left in a body? Did they know that {{something was going to}} happen? Such were the mute questions which their looks asked each other.|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>What</b> {{had they}} come for? And, {{disturbed}} to the heart, she gazed {{from one to}} the other. They had that curious look of people not quite knowing what their reception will be like, yet with something resolute, almost portentous, in their mien. She saw John go up to her aunt and hold out his hand.|$|R

6000|$|He read it, {{short as}} it was, a second time, and a third. If it meant any thing, {{it meant that}} the motive {{at the bottom of}} Anne's flight was to {{accomplish}} the sacrifice of herself to the happiness of Blanche. She had parted for life from his niece for his niece's sake! <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean?</b> And how was it to be reconciled with Anne's position--as described to him by Mrs. Inchbare during his visit to Craig Fernie? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>what</b> <b>does</b> all <b>this</b> <b>mean</b> about YOUR {{purchasing}} the land, Mr. Brant?" [...] said Mrs. Peyton quickly, fixing her eyes intently on Clarence.|$|R

6000|$|... "Come," [...] he said, [...] "it {{seems to}} me that I have arrived opportunely. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean?</b> Who are these people? Miss Sinclair, is this man your companion? What does he mean by {{speaking}} in such a tone to a dying man?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean?</b> It {{meant that}} {{within a few days}} Jane, my only and darling child, the very hope and centre of my life, would be in the fangs {{of one of the most}} dreadful and {{dangerous}} diseases known to humanity. More, having never been vaccinated, that disease was sure to strike her with its full force, and the type of it which had appeared in the city was such that certainly not more than one-half of the unprotected persons attacked came alive out of the struggle.|$|R
6000|$|Her heart thumped. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean?</b> Why had he come? How had he dared? How {{could he}} have been so treacherous to her? Ah, but he was ignorant, of course, {{that she had not}} told her father. A veritable {{judgment}} on her! She ran straight in and up the stairs. The voice of Betty, [...] "Your bath's ready, Miss Gyp," [...] roused her. And crying, [...] "Oh, Betty darling, bring me up my tea!" [...] she ran into the bathroom. She was safe there; and in the delicious heat of the bath faced the situation better.|$|R

6000|$|... "As I read, however, I applied much {{personally}} {{to my own}} feelings and condition. I found myself similar {{yet at the same}} time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I was a listener. I sympathized with and partly understood them, but I was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none. 'The path of my departure was free,' and there was none to lament my annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean?</b> Who was I? What was I? Whence <b>did</b> I come? <b>What</b> was my destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to solve them.|$|R
6000|$|Turnbull leapt {{up again}} in a living fury and cried: [...] "What have I {{got to do with}} MacIan? I believe all I ever believed, and disbelieve all I ever disbelieved. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> all <b>this</b> <b>mean,</b> and <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you want with me here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{say that}} your master desires peace above all things," [...] he said. [...] "Let me see what our {{intelligence}} department has to say. Since the day of my accession to the throne you have concentrated within twenty miles of my frontier nearly thirty thousand men. Day by day this work of moving up troops has been going on.

6000|$|... 1. [...] "Sooner or later," [...] says Mr. Cunningham, [...] "the {{population}} {{problem will}} block the way once more." [...] <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean,</b> except that multiplication, excessive {{in relation to}} the contemporaneous means of support, will create a severe competition for those means?

6000|$|I see a {{dispatch}} {{here from}} Saint Louis, {{which is a}} little difficult for me to understand. It says [...] "General Schofield has refused leave of absence to members in military service to attend the legislature. All such are radical and administration men. The election of two Senators from this place on Thursday will probably turn upon this thing." [...] <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>mean?</b> Of course members of the legislation must be allowed to attend its sessions. But how is there a session before the recent election returns are in? And how is it to be at [...] "this place"--and that is Saint Louis? Please inform me.|$|E
50|$|Immediately {{stop with}} the work of this {{so-called}} telegraph agency - TAH. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> even <b>mean?</b> You're sliding with full force into separatism. Don't you realize that even federal states have a single telegraph agency. Let your example be the Soviet Union if no other.|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>did</b> all <b>this</b> <b>mean?</b> Was he {{afraid that}} his {{colleague}} might stumble on some discovery {{which he was}} in search of himself? And did the discovery relate to his own special subject of brains and nerves? Ovid made an attempt to understand him.|$|R
