5|$|His {{successes in}} Italy secured Nikephoros a {{friendly}} <b>welcome</b> <b>and</b> honours {{on his return}} to Constantinople, {{but he is not}} mentioned again for several years, until the outbreak of war with Bulgaria in 894. In the meantime, he was raised to the rank of patrikios and named to the post of Domestic of the Schools, in effect commander-in-chief of the Byzantine army, {{after the death of his}} predecessor, Andrew the Scythian.|$|E
5|$|In February 1779, Lafayette reached Paris. For disobeying {{the king}} {{by going to}} America, he was placed under house arrest for eight days. This was merely face-saving by Louis XVI; Lafayette was given a hero's <b>welcome</b> <b>and</b> was soon invited to hunt with the king. As the American envoy was ill, Benjamin Franklin's {{grandson}} presented Lafayette with the gold-encrusted sword commissioned by the Continental Congress.|$|E

Adoption is the ultimate goal, but unadoptable cats may live out their lives on the property as well.|$|E
5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton and Stamford branches of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, the two branches are merged. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) have an awkward reunion, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) tries to make his new employees feel <b>welcome,</b> <b>and</b> a rivalry begins between Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Andy Bernard (Ed Helms).|$|E

5|$|Arthur Conan Doyle {{was active}} in the area between 1891 and 1894. Although he lived in nearby South Norwood he visited the Crystal Palace and Upper Norwood area {{regularly}} in connection with the Upper Norwood Literary and Scientific Society. The Foresters Hall on Westow Street was then known as the Welcome Hall (or just <b>Welcome)</b> <b>and</b> it was in that hall in May 1892 that Arthur Conan Doyle was elected president of the society. He was re-elected to the post in 1893 and resigned in 1894. Each occasion was in the same hall.|$|E
5|$|In February 1935, Hu Die {{was invited}} to join a Chinese {{delegation}} {{to participate in the}} Moscow International Film Festival in the Soviet Union. She was the only film star in the delegation, which mainly comprised influential men of the industry. She arrived too late for the festival, but received a warm <b>welcome,</b> <b>and</b> her films Twin Sisters and Orchid in a Remote Valley (Konggu Lan) were shown in Moscow and Leningrad. From Moscow she went on to tour Germany, France, England, Switzerland and Italy, receiving significant public attention and VIP treatment from the Europeans, to whom Chinese film stars were novelties. She took many notes and photographs, and published a travelogue after returning to China.|$|E
5|$|When Dean {{returned}} to the United States, he received a hero's <b>welcome</b> <b>and</b> was presented {{with a number of}} decorations, including the Medal of Honor, which he was unaware he had been awarded. Dean maintained he did not think his own experience was particularly heroic and asserted he did not feel he deserved an award for his actions in Korea. He was given a ticker-tape parade in New York City on his return to the US on October 26, 1953, and he was made the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade on January 1, 1954.|$|E

5|$|Agârbiceanu visited Bucharest, the Old Kingdom capital, in 1906, {{and sent}} {{enthusiastic}} travel notes for Unirea. He became {{a regular contributor}} to the Bucharest nationalist review Sămănătorul, which gave De la țară a sonorous <b>welcome,</b> <b>and</b> later to Sămănătoruls leftist rival, Viața Românească. From 1909, he {{was also one of the}} regulars at Neamul Românesc. For his literary activity, he was elected a corresponding member of Astra in 1912, and was promoted to full membership in 1925. From 1910 to 1919, he was parish priest at Orlat in Sibiu County. Agârbiceanu was also a member of Austria-Hungary's Romanian National Party (PNR), and supported PNR youth leader Octavian Goga, his colleague at Luceafărul and Tribuna. In 1910, he followed Goga as he parted from the PNR and launched his own independent faction.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale Indian {{immigration}} to the Pacific coast of North America {{took place in the}} 20th century, especially from Punjab, which faced an economic depression. The Canadian government met this influx with legislation aimed at limiting the entry of South Asians into Canada and at restricting the political rights of those already in the country. The Punjabi community had hitherto been an important loyal force for the British Empire and the Commonwealth. The community had expected that its commitment would be honoured with the same <b>welcome</b> <b>and</b> rights which the British and colonial governments extended to British and white immigrants. The restrictive legislation fed growing discontent, protests and anti-colonial sentiments within the community. Faced with increasingly difficult situations, the community began organising itself into political groups. Many Punjabis also moved to the United States, but they encountered similar political and social problems. Meanwhile, India House and nationalist activism of Indian students had begun declining on the east coast of North America towards 1910, but activity gradually shifted west to San Francisco. The arrival at this time of Har Dayal from Europe bridged the gap between the intellectual agitators in New York and the predominantly Punjabi labour workers and migrants in the west coast, and laid the foundations of the Ghadar movement.|$|E
5|$|Like Dewoitine, German {{designer}} Kurt Tank, {{the former}} technical {{director of the}} Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau AG, had been similarly hired in 1947 {{to work on a}} jet fighter project for Argentina. Tank, along with 62 of his compatriots at Focke-Wulf, had emigrated to Latin America to restart his career in aerospace ventures. Surreptitiously entering the country with a passport identifying him as Pedro Matthies, he found a warm <b>welcome</b> <b>and</b> did not maintain the subterfuge of a secret identity. Along with his former employees, he was instrumental {{in the evolution of the}} Instituto Aerotécnico into Argentina's military aircraft factory, the Fábrica Militar de Aviones at Córdoba. Tank was both an engineer as well as a test pilot, who had designed the Fw 190 fighter, but his design team had also been responsible for the Focke-Wulf Ta 183, an unbuilt project that had been declared the winner of the 1945 Emergency Fighter Competition. The diminutive, swept-wing, jet-powered Ta 183, designed by Focke-Wulf engineer/designer Hans Multhopp, had only reached the stage of wind tunnel studies before the end of hostilities.|$|E

5|$|Phips, whose motives {{continue}} to be debated by historians today, claimed this {{was a violation of}} the terms of capitulation, and consequently declared the agreement void. He allowed his troops to sack the town and destroy the church, acts that he had promised to prevent in the oral surrender agreement. He had the fortifications destroyed, removing all of their weaponry. Before he left, he convinced a number of Acadians to swear oaths of allegiance to the English crown, appointed a council of locals to administer the town, and then sailed back to Boston, carrying Meneval and his garrison as prisoners of war. Phips received a hero's <b>welcome</b> <b>and</b> was lavished with praise, although he was criticized in some circles (and has been vilified in French and Acadian histories) for allowing the sacking of Port Royal.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Football Union (SFU), the {{governing}} body for rugby union in Scotland, {{did not give}} the New Zealanders an official <b>welcome,</b> <b>and</b> sent only one official to greet them on their arrival in Edinburgh. In addition, the SFU refused a financial guarantee for the match, promising the gate receipts to the New Zealanders instead; {{this meant that the}} NZRFU had to take on all monetary responsibilities for the match. One reason for the cold reception from the SFU may have been because of negative reports from David Bedell-Sivright, who was Scotland's captain and had also captained the British Isles team on their 1904 tour of New Zealand. Bedell-Sivright had reported unfavourably on his experiences in New Zealand the previous year, especially regarding the wing-forward play of Gallaher.|$|E
5|$|When the English {{selectors}} met {{to choose}} the team, Allen, Griffith and Gilligan were present to represent the MCC; they had no official say in the selection, but Oborne suggests that Allen {{made it clear that}} he considered D'Oliveira unworthy of a place on the team on cricketing grounds. D'Oliveira was eventually left out, to considerable anger and controversy. When he was later added to the team following an injury to another player, Vorster said that the MCC would not be <b>welcome</b> <b>and</b> the tour was cancelled. Some of the events leading up to D'Oliveira's exclusion became public knowledge the following year; the MCC came under heavy public pressure, and the press called for Allen to resign. Oborne suggests that Allen, although not a supporter of apartheid, wished to maintain the traditional links between England and South Africa; he regarded opponents of apartheid as enemies of the MCC and the Establishment.|$|E

5|$|Nelson, the Hamiltons {{and several}} other British {{travellers}} left Leghorn for Florence on 13 July. They made stops at Trieste and Vienna, spending three weeks in the latter where they were entertained by the local nobility and heard the Missa in Angustiis by Haydn that now bears Nelson's name. By September they were in Prague, and later called at Dresden, Dessau and Hamburg, from where they caught a packet ship to Great Yarmouth, arriving on 6 November. Nelson was given a hero's <b>welcome</b> <b>and</b> after being sworn in as a freeman of the borough and received the massed crowd's applause. He subsequently {{made his way to}} London, arriving on 9 November. He attended court and was guest of honour at a number of banquets and balls. It was during this period that Fanny Nelson and Emma Hamilton met for the first time. During this period, Nelson was reported as being cold and distant to his wife and his attention to Emma became the subject of gossip. With the marriage breaking down, Nelson began to hate even being in the same room as Fanny. Events came to a head around Christmas, when according to Nelson's solicitor, Fanny issued an ultimatum on whether he was to choose her or Emma. Nelson replied: I love you sincerely but I cannot forget my obligations to Lady Hamilton or speak of her otherwise than with affection and admiration. The two never lived together again after this.|$|E
5|$|Resistance {{against the}} Spanish continued, and hostile Ch'ol killed {{a number of}} newly baptised Christian Indians. Franciscan friars Antonio Margil and Melchor López were active among the Lakandon and Manche Ch'ol between 1692 and 1694; they {{eventually}} outstayed their <b>welcome</b> <b>and</b> were expelled by the Ch'ol. In 1695, the colonial authorities decided to act upon a plan to connect the province of Guatemala with Yucatán, and soldiers commanded by Jacinto de Barrios Leal, president of the Real Audiencia of Guatemala, conquered a number of Ch'ol communities. The {{most important of these}} was Sakb'ajlan on the Lacantún River in eastern Chiapas, which was renamed as Nuestra Señora de Dolores, or Dolores del Lakandon, in April 1695. This was one part of a three-pronged attack against the independent inhabitants of Chiapas and neighbouring Petén; a second group joined up with Barrios Leal having marched from Huehuetenango, in the Guatemalan Highlands. The third group, under Juan Díaz de Velasco, marched from Verapaz, Guatemala, against the Itza of northern Petén. Barrios Leal was accompanied by Franciscan friar Antonio Margil who served as an advisor as well as his personal confessor and chaplain to his troops. The Spanish built a fort and garrisoned it with 30 Spanish soldiers. Mercederian friar Diego de Rivas was based at Dolores del Lakandon, and he and his fellow Mercederians baptised several hundred Lakandon Ch'ols in the following months and established contacts with neighbouring Ch'ol communities.|$|E
