He served as a flag bearer in the 45th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion at Fort Bliss, where he played with the Harlem Globetrotters on a {{part-time}} basis. In 1953, he was discharged from the army and joined the Monarchs {{for the remainder of}} that season, achieving a [...]347 batting average. Banks later said, [...] "Playing for the Kansas City Monarchs <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> school, my learning, my world. It was my whole life." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000 Apple Records {{released}} a thirtieth anniversary {{edition of the}} album and Harrison actively participated in its promotion, giving an interview during which he reflected on the work: [...] "It's just something that <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> continuation from the Beatles, really. It was me sort {{of getting out of}} the Beatles and just going my own way... it was a very happy occasion." [...] He commented on the production: [...] "Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now. In fact, I don't use reverb at all. I can't stand it... You know, it's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Love {{was ordered}} into {{lockdown}} rehab by a California judge {{after a series}} of legal issues and controlled substance charges. After her release in 2006, she published a memoir, , and started recording what would become her second solo album, How Dirty Girls Get Clean, collaborating again with Perry and Smashing Pumpkins vocalist/guitarist Billy Corgan in the writing and recording. Love had written several songs, including an anti-cocaine song titled [...] "Loser Dust", during her time in rehab in 2005. She told Billboard: [...] "My hand-eye coordination was so bad , I didn't even know chords anymore. It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> fingers were frozen. And I wasn't allowed to make noise ... I never thought I would work again." [...] Some tracks and demos from the album (initially planned for release in 2008) were leaked on the internet in 2006, and a documentary entitled The Return of Courtney Love, detailing the making of the album, aired on the British television network More4 in the fall of that year. A rough acoustic version of [...] "Never Go Hungry Again", recorded during an interview for The Times in November, was also released. Incomplete audio clips of the song [...] "Samantha", originating from an interview with NPR, were also distributed on the internet in 2007.|$|E

500|$|By 1974, Patti Smith was {{performing}} rock music, initially with guitarist, bassist and rock archivist Lenny Kaye, and {{later with a}} full band comprising Kaye, Ivan Kral on guitar and bass, Jay Dee Daugherty on drums and Richard Sohl on piano. Ivan Kral was a refugee from Czechoslovakia who {{had moved to the}} United States in 1966 with his parents, who were diplomats. After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Kral decided not to return. Financed by Sam Wagstaff, the band recorded a first single, [...] "Hey Joe / Piss Factory", in 1974. The A-side was a version of the rock standard {{with the addition of a}} spoken word piece about fugitive heiress Patty Hearst ("Patty Hearst, you're standing there in front of the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread, I was wondering were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women..."). A court later heard that Hearst had been confined against her will, and had been repeatedly threatened with execution and raped. The B-side describes the helpless anger Smith had felt while working on a factory assembly line and the salvation she discovered in the form of a shoplifted book, the 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud's Illuminations. In a 1996 interview which discusses artistic influences during her younger years, Smith said, [...] "I had devoted so much of my girlish daydreams to Rimbaud. Rimbaud <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> boyfriend." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1982 the Cure {{recorded}} and released Pornography, {{the third and}} final album of an [...] "oppressively dispirited" [...] trio that cemented the Cure's stature as purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre. Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was [...] "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But {{it had nothing to do}} with the group, it just had to do with what I <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> <b>my</b> age and things. I think I got to my worst round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time". Gallup described the album by saying, [...] "Nihilism took over [...] We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that is exactly what we thought at the time." [...] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track [...] "The Hanging Garden" [...] for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces. The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure.|$|E
500|$|Casting for {{the film}} began as soon as Madonna had signed up for it. Griffin Dunne was signed to play the part of Loudon Trott, a lawyer whose job was to help Nikki get on a bus, after she was released. Initially Madonna had thought of asking Penn to play the part of Detective Bellson, but Penn was serving a 60-day jail term, having {{violated}} the probation he received in 1986, for assaulting a friend of Madonna and attacking an extra {{on the set of}} At Close Range. The part went to Robert Swan, followed by the signing of John McMartin, Haviland Morris and Bibi Besch as Trott's father-in-law, fiancée, and mother-in-law [...] respectively. Madonna herself commented that she had a lot in common with the character Nikki. [...] "She's courageous and sweet and funny and misunderstood. But she clears her name in the last, and that's always good to do. I'm continuously doing that with the public. I liked Nikki's tough side and her sweet side. The toughness is only a mask for the vulnerability she feels inside." [...] Madonna was also offered the lead role in the Blake Edwards comedy film Blind Date opposite to Bruce Willis, but she refused it in favor of Slammer. She said, [...] "The thing I had planned to do after Shanghai Surprise was Blind Date at Tri-Star. I was supposed to have the approval of the director and the leading man, but they didn't tell me they'd already hired Bruce Willis. That... just didn't work out. But I was really excited about doing a real physical, screwball comedy, so when Jamie brought this up, it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> reward." [...] Coati Mundi, member of Kid Creole and the Coconuts, and Madonna's long-time friend joined the cast {{to play the role of}} Raoul, Nikki's enemy. Costume designer Deborah Scott was signed to create the wardrobe {{for the film}}. Madonna, who visualized the character of Nikki as a dizzy screwball blond, started watching the screwball comedies of the sixties, especially the work of actors like Cary Grant, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard and Judy Holiday. She asked Scott to create comical rah-rah and ballet tutu skirts for the character, with fishnet tights and loud make-up. Scott also designed a glamorous Monroe-esque dress for the love scene between her and Dunne.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the album's lyrical {{inspiration}}, Robyn told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul in March 2008: [...] "I {{think the}} biggest lyrical inspiration for this album {{was going back to}} when I was like 15 and on the subway listening to hip hop. Back then—because I didn't know many people in Sweden who knew about rap, it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> own music world—where the lyrics were very direct. So I tried to return to that age when you're so strong and self-confident, while acknowledging there's also a part of being a teenager when you're sometimes very insecure and feel very fragile." ...|$|E
2500|$|After not {{appearing}} for Brazil in two years, Kaká was recalled on 28 September 2012 for {{the friendly}} matches against Iraq and Japan in October. Following his recall to the Seleção squad, Kaká stated, [...] "I admit {{it was a}} surprise this call... When the list was published, I was extremely happy. It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> first call-up." [...] Brazil coach Mano Menezes stated that despite Kaká and Oscar's similarities, the two would be able to play alongside each other, as Kaká had slightly changed his playing style. On his return to the national side, Kaká scored in both matches, a 6–0 win over Iraq and a 4–0 win over Japan. Kaká retained his place in the squad for Brazil's 1,000th game in history, a 1–1 friendly draw against Colombia on 14 November 2012.|$|E

During this time, Cao Pi personally visited him, held his hand and sobbed with grief. Xiahou Shang died shortly after. Cao Pi honoured him with the posthumous title [...] "Marquis Dao" [...] (悼侯) and wrote an official eulogy for him: [...] "(Xiahou) Shang had been a close companion to me since my childhood. He was loyal, sincere and faithful. Although we did not have the same parents, we were as close as brothers. He <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> stomach and heart, and like claws and teeth to me.

2500|$|In June 1970, {{after one}} season at Miami, Bo Schembechler offered Burton an {{assistant}} coaching position at Michigan, and Burton accepted. [...] Despite his {{strong ties to}} Miami, Burton recalled {{that he could not}} pass on the opportunity to coach at Michigan: [...] "I left Miami to coach at Michigan because of the challenge and an upward move in the profession." [...] Burton remained an assistant coach at Michigan for 22 years from 1970 to 1991. He began in 1970 as the coach of the freshman football team, coached receivers from 1972 to 1980 and then took over as the running backs coach from 1980 to 1992. [...] Burton was the position coach for All-American receivers Jim Smith and Anthony Carter and to running back Jamie Morris. [...] In 1990, Burton said that Morris was favorite Michigan player. Morris gave credit to Burton for his development: [...] "Tirrel was everything to me. He <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> father and mother. He always was in my corner. Bo would get on me, and he would take some of the blame for me. He handled each individual the way he needed to be handled." [...] Burton reported that coaching under Schembechler had been a huge honor: [...] "Bo Schembechler was a great coach. He was from the same mold as Ara ... Bo was demanding of his coaches and his players. I learned most of what I know about football from Bo." ...|$|E
