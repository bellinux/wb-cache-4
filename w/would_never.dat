5|$|The 189th Infantry Brigade {{was first}} {{constituted}} and activated on 24 June 1921 in the Organized Reserves, and {{assigned to the}} 95th Division. The brigade was organized in 1922 at Muskogee, Oklahoma. However, it <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be mobilized for World War I, and thus never received participation credit for the action. It would stay active as a reserve brigade for the interwar period, but it <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be used.|$|E

5|$|Both Sherman and McKinley {{sought a}} {{peaceful}} resolution to the Cuban War, preferably involving an independent Cuba without American intervention. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but {{it became clear that}} Spain <b>would</b> <b>never</b> concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) <b>would</b> <b>never</b> settle for anything less. In January 1898, Spain promised some concessions to the rebels, but when American consul Fitzhugh Lee reported riots in Havana, McKinley agreed to send the battleship USS Maine there to protect American lives and property. On February 15, the Maine exploded and sank with 266 men killed.|$|E
5|$|Fischer had {{not played}} {{competitive}} chess for eighteen months, and many thought he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> return. Then, to general surprise and delight, {{he agreed to}} participate in the Soviet Union vs. the Rest of the World in 1970 in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|For decades, {{rebels in}} Cuba had waged an {{intermittent}} campaign for freedom from Spanish colonial rule. By 1895, the conflict had expanded {{to a war}} for Cuban independence. As war engulfed the island, Spanish reprisals against the rebels grew ever harsher. American public opinion favored the rebels, and McKinley shared in their outrage against Spanish policies. However while public opinion called for war to liberate Cuba, McKinley favored a peaceful approach, hoping that through negotiation, Spain might be convinced to grant Cuba independence, {{or at least to}} allow the Cubans some measure of autonomy. The United States and Spain began negotiations on the subject in 1897, but it became clear that Spain <b>would</b> <b>never</b> concede Cuban independence, while the rebels (and their American supporters) <b>would</b> <b>never</b> settle for anything less.|$|E

5|$|In 1237, Vladislav {{signed a}} treaty {{regarding}} trading privileges with Giovanni Dandolo, {{a representative of}} Ragusa. The treaty gave Ragusa trading privileges {{under the condition that}} Ragusa <b>would</b> <b>never</b> allow any preparation of rebellion against Serbia on their territory, as Ragusa had helped Radoslav upon his exile.|$|E
5|$|In {{his opening}} statement, Krum argued that Burton had only agreed {{to act as}} general counsel and to allow his name {{to be placed in}} Rialto's literature, and that the {{agreement}} explicitly provided that Burton <b>would</b> <b>never</b> represent Rialto before any federal agency.|$|E
5|$|Liliʻuokalani helped {{preserve}} {{key elements}} of Hawaii's traditional poetics while mixing in Western harmonies brought by the missionaries. A compilation of her works, titled The Queen's Songbook, was published in 1999 by the Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust. Liliʻuokalani used her musical compositions {{as a way to}} express her feelings for her people, her country, and {{what was happening in the}} political realm in Hawaii. One example of the way her music reflected her political views is her translation of the Kumulipo, the Hawaiian creation chant. While under house arrest, Liliʻuokalani feared she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> leave the palace alive, so she translated the Kumulipo in hopes that the history and culture of her people <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be lost. The ancient chants record her family's genealogy back to the origin story of Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|Lukashenko's inauguration {{ceremony}} of 22 January 2011 was boycotted by EU ambassadors, and only thirty-two foreign diplomats attended.

The {{latter is}} intended to [...] "raise awareness of the 'ripple effect' that abortion has on men, women, children, families, and communities.“ [...] Ohden says [...] "parents of an unborn child often fail to consider how their decision affects others" [...] saying, [...] "my daughter <b>would</b> have <b>never</b> had life if that abortion had succeeded”. “My husband, he <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have had a wife.” “My adoptive parents <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have had a child." ...|$|R

5|$|The divorce proved {{difficult}} for Jackson, who spent several weeks lamenting his loss. Presley {{was the first}} person with whom he had connected on such a high level. She had supported him as he faced allegations and became dependent on pain medication. It was also {{the first time that the}} pop singer had had a sexual chemistry with another. Presley was able to make him open up and express himself through their physically intimate moments together. At the time, Jackson was afraid there <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be another who made him feel the way his ex-wife had. He eventually realized he had to move on; he had a world tour coming up and music to work on. Jackson also knew that Presley <b>would</b> <b>never</b> make him a father, which he longed to be.|$|E
5|$|After the hearing, Jones {{allegedly}} spat in {{the face}} of his son's attorney, Carol Powell-Lexing, and supposedly pushed her to the floor. Jones denied assaulting Powell-Lexing, saying he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> get into a physical fight with a woman. Jones was charged with assault. Despite the alleged assault, Powell-Lexing continued as part of Bell's defense team.|$|E

Also, Mel was touched when Tommy stated that {{had it not been}} for Alice working there, he <b>would</b> have <b>never</b> had a second father, which Mel had become to him. Mel reciprocated the sentiments by stating [...] "and I <b>would</b> have <b>never</b> had a kid to raise." ...|$|R
5|$|Altgens {{shared a}} story about Billy Lovelady for No More Silence: An Oral History of the Assassination of President Kennedy (1998). Lovelady had {{contacted}} Altgens {{and asked him to}} deliver a copy of the first photograph along Elm Street. Altgens was met instead by Lovelady's wife, who said her husband <b>would</b> <b>never</b> agree to be interviewed. The couple had moved several times, but they were still being harassed by people who wanted the shirt Lovelady was wearing when Kennedy was shot.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{paradoxical}} {{in evolutionary}} terms, {{as it makes}} individuals conspicuous to predators, so they may be killed and the trait eliminated before predators learn to avoid it. If warning colouration puts the first few individuals at such a strong disadvantage, it <b>would</b> <b>never</b> last in the species long enough to become beneficial.|$|E
5|$|As Presley {{had refused}} to carry Jackson's children, Rowe offered {{to give birth to}} a child for the pop singer. Shortly after Presley and Jackson's separation, Rowe became {{pregnant}} but suffered a miscarriage in March 1996. The event devastated Rowe, who feared she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> {{be able to have a}} baby. Jackson comforted and consoled Rowe throughout the ordeal, which remained hidden from the media and public.|$|E
50|$|Nash <b>never</b> <b>would</b> {{have become}} Edward’s pet in America and <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have journeyed back to Africa to unsuccessfully fend off disease and later die. Martha <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have {{lost her husband}} and daughter. And Travis <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have died in Italy. All of these {{characters}} died in lands that were strange to them, suggesting that the characters were ill at ease in their new environments ever since they were taken from Africa. The narrator {{at the beginning and}} end of the text, however, is still optimistic, reasoning that his children will still reach the other side of the river - their true home - if they are determined and willing to survive.|$|R
