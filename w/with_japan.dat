5|$|These attacks led the United States, Britain, China, Australia {{and several}} other states to {{formally}} declare war on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement <b>with</b> <b>Japan.</b> Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States in solidarity <b>with</b> <b>Japan,</b> citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been ordered by Roosevelt.|$|E

5|$|A fleet was {{necessary}} for the defeat of Japan, and eventually a sizeable one, the British Pacific Fleet, did go to the Far East, where it fought alongside the United States Pacific Fleet. The closer relations that developed between the two navies prior to the outbreak of war <b>with</b> <b>Japan,</b> and the alliance that developed from it afterwards, became the most positive and enduring strategic legacy of the Singapore strategy.|$|E
5|$|Although the Tang {{had fought}} the Japanese, they still held cordial {{relations}} <b>with</b> <b>Japan.</b> There were numerous Imperial embassies to China from Japan, diplomatic missions {{that were not}} halted until 894 by Emperor Uda (r. 887–897), upon persuasion by Sugawara no Michizane (845–903). The Japanese Emperor Tenmu (r. 672–686) even established his conscripted army on that of the Chinese model, his state ceremonies on the Chinese model, and constructed his palace at Fujiwara on the Chinese model of architecture.|$|E
5|$|Having already {{released}} precious destroyers for convoy duty, {{they were}} unwilling to further weaken {{the ability of the}} U.S. to defend itself through the scattering of the all-important battle fleet. Furthermore, Admiral Benson was uneasy about the prospect, ever-present in the early 20th century, of a second war breaking out <b>with</b> <b>Japan.</b> For the moment, the U.S. Navy would send destroyers to Europe, but no battleships.|$|E

5|$|In 1853 Commodore Matthew Perry led the Perry Expedition, a {{squadron}} of four ships which sailed to Japan to establish normal relations <b>with</b> <b>Japan.</b> Perry's two technologically advanced steam-powered ships and calm, firm diplomacy convinced Japan to end three centuries of isolation and sign Treaty of Kanagawa with the U.S. in 1854. Nominally a treaty of friendship, the agreement soon {{paved the way for}} the opening of Japan and normal trade relations with the United States and Europe.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} The Technology Edge, {{published}} in 1983, O'Neill wrote about economic competition <b>with</b> <b>Japan.</b> He {{argued that the}} United States had to develop six industries to compete: microengineering, robotics, genetic engineering, magnetic flight, family aircraft, and space science. He also thought that industrial development was suffering from short-sighted executives, self-interested unions, high taxes, and poor education of Americans. According to reviewer Henry Weil, O'Neill's detailed explanations of emerging technologies differentiated the book from others on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Palau's {{interaction}} <b>with</b> <b>Japan</b> {{was kept}} to a minimal level during the post-war years, although Okinawan fishermen occasionally visited Palau for catches from the 1960s onwards. A few Japanese nationals resettled in Palau in the 1970s, and married local Palauans. In the 1980s, Japanese businessmen set up businesses in Palau, and by 1995 there were 218 Japanese nationals residing in Palau. Of these, {{about half of them}} expressed a desire for permanent residency in Palau and a few married Palauan or Filipino women. However, the majority brought their families from Japan along, and maintained frequent contacts <b>with</b> <b>Japan.</b> Some settlers from the 1980s also consisted of former Japanese settlers who were repatriated back to Japan after World War II. Former settlers who returned to Palau usually consisted of individuals over 60 years of age, and often worked as tour guides or restaurateurs in Palau.|$|E

5|$|Repatriation of Canadian internees and {{remaining}} American internees {{was announced in}} August 1943 (not all American internees had been repatriated in June 1942). Preparations similar to the prior repatriation were made, including messages and reports to be delivered. The ship, the Teia Maru, reached Hong Kong on 23 September, taking on board 73 Canadian internees, 24 American internees, and 13 Latin American internees. The ship sailed to Goa, where an exchange of prisoners and internees <b>with</b> <b>Japan</b> took place.|$|E

5|$|The {{authors of}} War Memorandum (Eastern) 1920 divided a war <b>with</b> <b>Japan</b> into three phases. In the first phase, the {{garrison}} of Singapore would defend the fortress while the fleet {{made its way}} from home waters to Singapore. Next, the fleet would sail from Singapore and relieve or recapture Hong Kong. The final phase would see the fleet blockade Japan and force it to accept terms.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{date of the}} war's end is {{also not}} universally agreed upon. It was {{generally}} accepted {{at the time that}} the war ended with the armistice of 14 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than the formal surrender of Japan (2 September 1945). A peace treaty <b>with</b> <b>Japan</b> was signed in 1951. A treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place in 1990 and resolved other post-World War II issues.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of war <b>with</b> <b>Japan</b> in December 1941, and the imminent threat of invasion saw the 6th and 7th Divisions {{transferred to the}} Far East in early 1942.

The 509th Composite Group was awarded an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award in 1999.|$|E
5|$|When the Japanese {{surrendered}} in 1945, Japanese business {{enterprises and}} organisations in Palau closed, effectively ending the Japanese influence on Palau's economy. In {{the first two}} decades after the war, the American occupation government imposed strict trade restrictions <b>with</b> <b>Japan.</b> Contact <b>with</b> <b>Japan</b> was reestablished in the 1960s, starting with Okinawan fishermen who were granted fishing rights. Japanese tourists began to visit Palau in increasing numbers from the mid-1970s. The growing influx of tourists to Palau led to the restoration of heritage sites around Palau, particularly memorial sites and administrative buildings built in the Japanese era as well as Palauan longhouses to accommodate {{to the interests of}} Japanese tourists, which accounted for half of all visiting tourists. Many of Palau's tourist sites were run and maintained by Palauan citizens of Japanese-Palauan heritage, whose knowledge in Japanese and Palauan customs and languages helped to facilitate tour groups consisting of Japanese tourists.|$|E
