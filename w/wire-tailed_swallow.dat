50|$|This bird {{is found}} in open country near water and human habitation. <b>Wire-tailed</b> <b>swallows</b> are fast flyers and they {{generally}} feed on insects, especially flies, while airborne. They are typically seen low over water, {{with which they are}} more closely associated than most swallows.|$|R
50|$|The Mekong Channel from Phou Xiang Thong to Siphandon Important Bird Area (IBA) is 34,200 ha in size. A {{portion of}} the IBA (10,000 hectares) {{overlaps}} with the 120,000 ha Phou Xieng Thong National Protected Area. The IBA encompasses two provinces, Champasak and Salavan. The IBA is at an elevation of 40 - 50 m. Its topography consists of earth banks, rocky banks, rocky islands, sandbars, low vegetated islands, rocky islets, and sandy beaches. Notable avifauna include Laos's last known nesting little terns, river lapwings, river terns, small pratincoles and <b>wire-tailed</b> <b>swallows.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Mekong Channel from Phou Xiang Thong to Siphandon" [...] IBA is 34,200 ha in size. There is a 10,000 ha {{overlap with}} the Phou Xiengthong National Biodiversity Conservation Area (NBCA is 120,000 ha in size). The IBA {{encompasses}} two provinces, Salavan and Champasak. The IBA's altitude is 40 - 50 m above sea level. Its topography {{is characterized by}} earth banks, rocky banks, rocky islands, seasonally flooded sandbars, low vegetated islands, rocky islets, sandy beaches, and sand bars. Notable avifauna is the last known nesting little terns (Sternula albifrons); there are also small pratincoles (Glareola lactea), river lapwings (Vanellus duvaucelii), <b>wire-tailed</b> <b>swallows</b> (Hirundo smithii), and river terns (Sterna aurantia).|$|R
50|$|Endangered {{bird species}} include great hornbill, rufous-necked hornbill, green peafowl and crested argus. Other bird species include <b>wire-tailed</b> <b>swallow,</b> wreathed hornbill, river lapwing, sooty babbler and rufous-throated fulvetta. One species {{is unique in}} Laos to Nam Kading: the pale-capped pigeon.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wire-tailed</b> <b>swallow</b> (Hirundo smithii) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the swallow family. It has two subspecies: H. s. smithii, {{which occurs}} throughout Africa, and H. s. filifera, which is found in southern and southeastern Asia. It is mainly resident, but populations in Pakistan and northern India migrate further south in winter. The genus name Hirundo is the Latin word for swallow. The species name smithii commemorates Christen Smith, a Norwegian botanist and geologist.|$|E
50|$|This species appropriates {{the nests}} of little swifts and those {{swallows}} which build retort-shaped nests. In Europe and north Africa, this usually means the red-rumped swallow, but {{south of the}} Sahara other species like <b>wire-tailed</b> <b>swallow</b> are also parasitised. The original owners of the nests are driven away, or the white-rumps settle in the nest and refuse to move. Once occupied, the nest is lined with feathers and saliva, {{and one or two}} eggs are laid.|$|E
50|$|The 18,230 hectare Mekong Channel {{upstream}} of Vientiane Important Bird Area (IBA) comprises an approximately 300 km {{section of}} the Mekong Channel upstream of Vientiane city. It is situated in two provinces: Sainyabuli and Vientiane. Topographical characteristics are braided streams, bushland, gravel bars, open sandy islands, rock outcrops, and sand bars. Recorded avifauna include <b>wire-tailed</b> <b>swallow</b> (Hirundo smithii), small pratincole (Glareola lactea), river lapwing (Vanellus duvaucelii), Jerdon's bush chat (Saxicola jerdoni), and the great thick-knee (Esacus recurvirostris).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>wire-tailed</b> <b>swallow</b> {{is a small}} swallow, {{measuring}} 18 cm in length. It has {{bright blue}} upperparts, bright white underparts and a chestnut cap. Immature birds lack tail wires, and have dull brown (rather than chestnut) caps. The species is named for the very long filamentous outermost tail feathers, which trail behind like two wires. The sexes are similar in appearance, but the female has shorter [...] "wires". Juveniles have a brown crown, back and tail. The Asian form, H. s. filifera, is larger and longer-tailed than the abundant African H. s. smithii.|$|E
