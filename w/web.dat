50|$|Many small {{crankcase}} compression two-stroke engines have {{a crankshaft}} with large circular <b>webs,</b> {{similar to the}} tunnel crankshaft. However these <b>webs</b> are merely <b>webs,</b> not bearings, and their bearings are of conventional small diameter alongside the <b>webs.</b> These enlarged <b>webs</b> are used instead to increase the compression ratio of the engine.

40|$|BackgroundTo {{classify}} {{and evaluate}} the clinical spectrum of congenital <b>webs</b> in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, including clinical courses and related factors. MethodsA retrospective chart review was performed on 37 patients with congenital GI <b>webs</b> at a pediatric care teaching hospital in north Taiwan. All of the related parameters were collected and analyzed. ResultsTwelve patients had gastric <b>webs,</b> 22 had duodenal <b>webs,</b> and three had jejunal <b>webs.</b> The mean time to diagnosis was 1576 days for gastric <b>webs,</b> 116 days for duodenal and 230 days for jejunal <b>webs.</b> There was {{a statistically significant difference}} between the gastric and duodenal groups (p =  0. 001). The major symptom was vomiting (78 %). Patients with duodenal <b>webs</b> had a high association with congenital anomalies (50 %). The major anomalies included cardiac (27 %) and GI anomalies (18 %). Endoscopy was performed in 10 gastric cases, and all of them were noted to have positive findings, including a fixed nonfolded stenotic ring following a second gastric chamber and a real pylorus. All of the patients received surgery except for three with gastric <b>webs,</b> and no mortality was noted. The mean postoperative days of tolerated feeding was 6 for those with gastric <b>webs,</b> 10 for those with duodenal and 11 for those with jejunal <b>webs.</b> ConclusionThe clinical course of gastrointestinal <b>webs</b> may be chronic or obscure. A delay from onset of symptoms to treatment may exist, especially in gastric <b>webs.</b> We suggest that prompt endoscopic confirmation and surgical intervention for these lesions, when suspected due to clinical and radiologic abnormalities, will decrease the morbidity of unexplained recurrent symptoms or signs of GI obstruction in these patients...|$|R
