5|$|Benedict Arnold then {{applied to}} {{accompany}} General Carleton, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to New York to replace Clinton as commander-in-chief; this request went nowhere. Other attempts all failed to gain positions {{within the government}} or the British East India Company {{over the next few}} years and he was forced to subsist on the reduced pay of non-wartime service. His reputation also came under criticism in the British press, especially when compared to that of Major André, who was celebrated for his patriotism.|$|E
5|$|The Angel of the Lord {{stated that}} Manoah's wife was {{to abstain from}} all {{alcoholic}} beverages, and her promised child was not to shave or cut his hair. He {{was to be a}} Nazirite from birth. In ancient Israel, those wanting to be especially dedicated to God for a time could take a Nazirite vow which included abstaining from wine and spirits, not cutting hair or shaving, and other requirements. The wife believed the Angel of the Lord; her husband was not present, so he prayed and asked God to send the messenger once again to teach them how to raise the boy <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be born.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were always taken from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The photo was intended as a message to the Emperor about <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be the senior partner in their relationship.|$|E

25|$|Initially, no studio would {{finance the}} film {{because of its}} {{potentially}} controversial and off-beat subject matter. After Drugstore Cowboy received favorable critical raves and awards, studios started to show some interest. However, they all wanted their own versions made and not Van Sant's. This frustration prompted the filmmaker to attempt the feature on a shoestring budget with a cast of actual street kids filling out the roles including Michael Parker and actor Rodney Harvey, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to play Scott.|$|E
