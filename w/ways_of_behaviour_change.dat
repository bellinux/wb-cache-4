40|$|Background: Malocclusion is problem since antiquity. But people’s {{perception}} {{about the}} problem varies with their geographical location and cultural background. The problem {{seems to be more}} acute in developing countries like Bangladesh. Objectives: The present study was undertaken to assess the awareness about aesthetic problem of malocclusion and treatment seeking behavior among the patients attending in orthodontic department of BSMMU. Methods: The present cross-sectional study was carried out in the Department of Orthodontic, Faculty of Dentistry, BSMMU, over a period 24 months from January 2008 to December 2009. A total of 110 participants who were suffering from malocclusion and came for dental treatment were the study population. Results: The mean age of the patients was 21 years and the youngest and the oldest patients were 8 and 32 years old respectively with female to male ratio being roughly 3 : 2. Graduate or postgraduate level educated patients were predominant (53. 6 %). Over 70 % of the respondents viewed malocclusion as an aesthetic problem, 50 % as functional problem, 55. 5 % social problem and 69. 1 % oral problem. Two-third (67 %) told that malocclusion was a treatable condition. Approximately 43 % of the patients identified trauma as a cause of malocclusion, 40 % gingivitis or periodontitis and 35. 5 % dental caries. About one-third (32. 7 %) of the respondents was of the opinion that certain habits should be avoided to prevent malocclusion, 15. 5 % told timely treatment of malocclusion, 30 % told prevention of early loss of teeth due to caries, 12. 7 % were in favour of the use of a space maintainer in places of premature loss of a deciduous tooth. Over 90 % of the respondents held the view that symptoms of malocclusion, its prevention and different treatment options should get the priority in educating the society about malocclusion. However, 80 % of the respondents told that causative factors should discussed. Regarding <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> communication (BCC), TV got the first priority (94 %) followed by newspaper (92 %), teacher (88 %), school health programme (84. 5 %), friends (76 %), health educators (43. 6 %) and poster got the least priority (30. 9 %). Conclusion: The study concludes that a substantial proportion of the patients of malocclusion are not aware of the causes and consequence of malocclusion. However, the patients are aware that malocclusion is an aesthetic problem and can be corrected. Key words: Malocclusion; aesthetic problem; treatment seeking behavior.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{discover}} how physicians {{develop an understanding}} of Native patients and communities that enables them to communicate better with these patients. DESIGN: Qualitative method of in-depth interviews. SETTING: Native communities across Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Ten non-Native physicians providing primary care to Native patients and communities. METHOD: In-depth, semistructured interviews explored communication strategies developed by primary care physicians working with Native patients. The audiotaped and transcribed interviews were analyzed by the investigators using the phenomenologic approach of immersion and crystallization. MAIN FINDINGS: Three main themes emerged. First was elements of communication: during patient-physician communication, physicians speak less, take more time with patients, and become comfortable with silence. Second was community context: patients' illnesses are not distinct from their community context; patient care and community relations, culture, and values are often inseparable. Third was the process of change in physicians: over time, participants increased understanding <b>of</b> Native culture, <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> communicating, and <b>behaviour.</b> <b>Change</b> comes about through long service, listening well, and participating in community events. CONCLUSION: Developing cross-cultural communication was difficult and took years, if not forever. Understanding Native communities changed physicians.

40|$|The Teenage Pregnancy Strategy {{launched}} in 1999 by the New Labour government called for renewed {{attention to a}} problem which {{was identified as a}} public health issue and as a cause of social exclusion. From the beginning its implementation focused on providing Sex and Relationship Education as well as easy access to sexual health services. The Guidance for Healthcare Professionals issued in 2004 particularly insists on the importance of offering a friendly and non-judgemental approach, and confidential advice and treatment to young people. Although the Strategy was constantly monitored and, along the years, a certain evolution can be seen, these two remain the key elements to deal successfully with this important issue. Moreover, a close analysis of the many documents published, the results achieved and the chosen approach, raises some questions about the importance given to autonomy, confidentiality and consent in public health, and to the <b>way</b> the promotion <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> is understood, and how the issue relates to the whole of society. Considering teenage pregnancy as a result of social inequalities, more than a cause of it, could lead to an approach more focused on dealing effectively with social inequalities. Besides, the importance of personal responsibility in relation to society, as intended by “Civic Republicanism”, could overcome the individual responsibility as understood within the liberal approach. The awareness of being members of a society in which we are all interdependent and responsible for our personal flourishing {{as well as that of}} society, may provide the right motivations both for young people to overcome the individualistic attitude of pursuing only one’s pleasure while avoiding adverse outcomes, and for professionals to take greater responsibility in offering significant support to young people, beyond merely complying with the requirements of their professional duties...|$|R

40|$|There {{is a need}} to {{consolidate}} the evidence base underlying our toolbox <b>of</b> methods <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change.</b> Recent efforts to this effect have conducted meta-regressions on evaluations <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> interventions, deriving each method's effectiveness from its association to intervention effect size.

40|$|Improving {{the design}} and {{implementation}} of interventions to encourage end-use energy efficiency {{has the potential to}} contribute a substantive reduction in carbon emissions. A plethora <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> frameworks is available to guide policymakers and designers but none {{have been found to be}} comprehensive or well-used. A new framework – the <b>Behaviour</b> <b>Change</b> Wheel (BCW) – purports to be a useful aid for developing all types <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> interventions.

To do this, components <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> programmes as identified in four EU guidance documents were mapped onto the BCW. Most of the components discussed in the guidance could be readily coded to the BCW framework. The main energy policy under-represented in the BCW was energy price.

40|$|Background Systematic reviews <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> {{interventions}} for smoking cessation vary in scope, quality, and applicability. The current review aims {{to generate more}} accurate and useful findings by (1) {{a detailed analysis of}} intervention elements that <b>change</b> <b>behaviour</b> (i. e. <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> techniques (BCTs)) and potential moderators <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> (i. e. other intervention and sample characteristics) and (2) assessing and controlling for variability in support provided to comparison groups in smoking cessation trials. Methods A systematic review will be conducted of randomized controlled trials <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> {{interventions for}} smoking cessation in adults (with or without pharmacological support), with a minimum follow-up of 6 months, published after 1995. Eligible articles will be identified through the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register. Study authors will be asked for detailed descriptions of smoking cessation support provided to intervention and comparison groups. All data will be independently coded by two researchers. The BCT taxonomy v 1 (tailored to smoking cessation interventions) and template for intervention description and replication criteria will be used to code intervention characteristics. Data collection will further include sample and trial characteristics and outcome data (smoking cessation rates). Multilevel mixed-effects meta-regression models will be used to examine which BCTs and/or BCT clusters delivered to intervention and comparison groups explain smoking cessation rates in treatment arms (and effect sizes) and what key moderators <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> are. Predicted effect sizes of each intervention will be computed assuming all interventions are compared against comparison groups receiving the same levels of behavioural support (i. e. low, medium, and high levels). Multi-disciplinary advisory board members (policymakers, health care providers, and (ex-) smokers) will provide strategic input throughout the project to ensure the review’s applicability to policy and practice. Discussion By capturing BCTs in intervention and comparison groups, this systematic review will provide more accurate estimates of the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions, the most promising BCTs and/or BCT clusters associated with smoking cessation rates in intervention and comparison arms, and important moderators <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change.</b> The results could set new standards for conducting meta-analyses <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> interventions and improve research, service delivery, and training in the area of smoking cessation.

40|$|Background: Current {{reporting}} of intervention content in published research articles and protocols is generally poor, with great diversity of terminology, {{resulting in low}} replicability. This study aimed to extend the scope and improve the reliability of a 26 -item taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> techniques developed by Abraham and Michie [Abraham, C. and Michie, S.

Methods: Three UK study centres collaborated in applying this existing taxonomy to two systematic reviews of interventions to increase physical activity and healthy eating. The taxonomy was refined in iterative steps of (1) coding intervention descriptions, and assessing inter-rater reliability, (2) identifying gaps and problems across study centres and (3) refining the labels and definitions based on consensus discussions. Results: Labels and definitions were improved for all techniques, conceptual overlap between categories was resolved, some categories were split and 14 techniques were added, resulting in a 40 -item taxonomy. Inter-rater reliability, assessed on 50 published intervention descriptions, was good (kappa = 0. 79). Conclusions: This taxonomy {{can be used to}} improve the specification of interventions in published reports, thus improving replication, implementation and evidence syntheses.

Theoretical explanations <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> maintenance focus on the differential nature and role of motives, self-regulation, resources (psychological and physical), habits, and environmental and social influences from initiation to maintenance.   Discussion: There are distinct patterns of theoretical explanations for <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> and for <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> maintenance. The findings from this review can guide the development and evaluation of interventions promoting maintenance <b>of</b> health <b>behaviours</b> and help {{in the development of}} an integrated theory <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> maintenance...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. This thesis {{explores the}} problem <b>of</b> sexual <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> {{in a country}} which has {{the largest number of}} people living with HIV in the world. Despite {{awareness}} of HIV, and knowledge <b>of</b> protective <b>behaviours,</b> many young South Africans still engage in risky sexual practices, exposing themselves to risk of HIV infection. This lack <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> by people who know the risks involved is the focus of this thesis. I begin by developing a critique <b>of</b> the dominant <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> theories which underpin HIV and AIDS interventions, {{and the way in which}} they conceptualise the relationship between the individual and society. These theories assume a universal, rational individual who engages in decision-making before action, or is prevented by problematic factors of ‘context’ (e. g. poverty, culture, gender dynamics) from engaging in appropriate protective health decisions. This conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> is inadequate in understanding the problem <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change.</b> Cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT), with its roots in the theories of Marx, Engels, Vygotsky and Leontiev, enables a different gaze on the problem <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change,</b> shifting the primary focus from cognition to activity. This provides an alternative dialectical conceptualisation of the relationship between the individual and society. In this thesis I articulate and extend the methodology inherent in CHAT. In a study conducted in a rural area in South Africa I recruited qualitative research processes to explore the cultural-historical context of early sexual experiences leading to intercourse; and the participants’ experiences of sexual activity in relation to HIV and AIDS. The conceptual and methodological tools inherent in CHAT enabled the production of the context of sexual activity. The focus on sexual activity as the central object unit and the analysis of the activity system illuminated the activity of sex as a social practice, produced and enacted within particular interpersonal, social and historical dynamics. Through an historical and current contextualisation of sexual activity CHAT-based analysis of the data enabled an articulation of contradictions and turbulence within the activity system. The problem of a lack <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> is understood through this production of context. Activity system analysis revealed how the introduction of the injectable contraceptive gendered the division of labour in sexual activity. An analysis of the relationship between the subject and the object of the activity system revealed a phalocentric identity investment as an outcome of sexual activity. This analysis also illustrated the relative invisibility of HIV compared to pregnancy as a negative outcome of sexual activity. These dynamics of the activity system structure power and resistance to change in the interaction. By accounting for the status of the activity system this analysis facilitated an understanding of a lack <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> in response to HIV and AIDS. This research process forms the basis for a tentative proposal for intervention using the CHAT-based Change Laboratory approach...|$|R

40|$|Participation {{in regular}} {{physical}} activity among young adults (16 - 24 years) is suboptimal. Research has attempted to understand what determines exercise behaviour and how interventions can assist individuals in adopting and adhering to exercise. This thesis consists of a literature review, and three separate studies. In the literature review, inactivity is defined, and the current physical activity patterns of industrialised society are discussed. Models <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> that enhance {{our understanding of the}} adoption and adherence process in physical activity are examined. In particular, the transtheoretical model <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> [TTM] has been selected for further study. This model is unique to the study <b>of</b> exercise <b>behaviour</b> because it provides researchers with an opportunity to identify and work with an inactive population, and permits the tailoring of physical activity interventions to make them more suitable for sedentary individuals. Initially, the TTM and its core constructs are explained, followed by a critique of the model. A review of empirical research in physical activity that has been based on the TTM is included. Over fifty key studies were identified; the limitations and strengths of these studies are explored. Finally, the discussions will summarise what has been learned to date about the application of the TTM to the understanding <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> modification in physical activity. In study one, constructs from the transtheoretical model <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> were chosen to help understand the process <b>of</b> exercise <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> <b>of</b> a student population. A total of 2943 respondents completed a baseline questionnaire and 1058 completed a follow-up 7 months later. A 5 -item stage of change and a 40 -item process of change questionnaire was used. There were significant differences in physical activity patterns from baseline to follow-up. There were also significant differences in process use across the stages. The process data was factor analysed to refine it further. A three-factor model revealed different motivational clusters underlying actual stage <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change.</b> Recommendations for intervention design suggest that adopting a positive behaviour should be treated differently to ceasing a negative behaviour. In study two, a pre-post randomised control design was used to investigate the effectiveness of a self-instructional intervention for helping a sedentary undergraduate population to become more active. The intervention was based on the transtheoretical model <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change.</b> Significantly more <b>of</b> the experimental group in comparison to the control group improved their stage of change from baseline. Self-efficacy and not decisional balance was found to be useful predictor of stage improvement. Discriminant analyses revealed that discrimination between stage improvement versus non-improvement was possible using the processes of change data. For stage improvers, the processes self-reevaluation and self-liberation were most frequently used, while social liberation was used significantly more by the experimental than the control group...|$|R
40|$|Anthropologists and geographers {{have long}} {{challenged}} reified {{theories of the}} state as a coherent whole representing strategic interests and promoting unified political projects. Instead {{the power of the state}} has been identified in its ability to sustain its own myth through negotiating its relation to civil society, through peopled practices, and through the spatialization of authority. This paper develops an ethnographic account of the recent enthusiasm for <b>Behaviour</b> <b>Change</b> in UK public policy, the consequences of which are two-fold. First we demonstrate how an anthropological perspective explains the emergence <b>of</b> <b>Behaviour</b> <b>Change</b> as a set of ideas, people, organisations, events and happenings: not only as a sometimes contradictory policy ?agenda?, but as a diverse and novel industry or cadre of expertise; and one that is played out in geographical ways. Secondly, we seek to show how the particularities <b>of</b> <b>Behaviour</b> <b>Change</b> policies pose new challenges to anthropological approaches to the state. Peer reviewe...|$|R

In order to advance science and technology in this area, it is essential to be able to build on principles and evidence <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> in an incremental manner. We report the development of an interactive smoking cessation website, StopAdvisor, designed to be attractive and effective across the social spectrum. It was informed by a broad motivational theory (PRIME), empirical evidence, web-design expertise, and user-testing. The intervention was developed using an open-source web-development platform, ‘LifeGuide’, designed to facilitate optimisation and collaboration. We identified 19 theoretical propositions, 33 evidence- or theory-based <b>behaviour</b> <b>change</b> techniques, 26 web-design principles and nine principles from user-testing. These were synthesised to create the website, ‘StopAdvisor’ (see [URL] The systematic and transparent application of theory, evidence, web-design expertise and user-testing within an open-source development platform can provide a basis for multi-phase optimisation contributing to an ‘incremental technology’ <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> <b>change...</b>|$|R
