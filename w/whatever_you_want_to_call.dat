A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno. Steve Harris has stated, [...] "There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it, that just gave it this great edge." [...] At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, [...] "Davey was so good he {{could do a lot}} of it on his own.

500|$|The term [...] "Obamacare" [...] was {{originally}} coined by opponents as a pejorative. The term emerged in March 2007 when healthcare lobbyist Jeanne Schulte Scott {{used it in}} a health industry journal, writing [...] "We will soon see a 'Giuliani-care' and 'Obama-care' {{to go along with}} 'McCain-care', 'Edwards-care', and a totally revamped and remodeled 'Hillary-care' from the 1990s". According to research by Elspeth Reeve, the expression was used in early 2007, generally by writers describing the candidate's proposal for expanding coverage for the uninsured. It first appeared in a political campaign by Mitt Romney in May 2007 in Des Moines, Iowa. Romney said, [...] "In my state, I worked on healthcare for some time. We had half a million people without insurance, and I said, 'How can we get those people insured without raising taxes and without having government take over healthcare?'

500|$|Costa's first {{recording}} {{as leader}} was in 1956, with his trio featuring bassist Vinnie Burke and drummer Nick Stabulas. This was released under slightly differing titles by Josie Records and Jubilee Records, and was well received: critic John S. Wilson, for instance, {{commented on the}} [...] "roaring, spitting piano solos by Eddie Costa". Around this time, Costa was nicknamed [...] "The Bear" [...] by Burke for his powerful playing. Also in 1956, Costa and Burke joined guitarist Tal Farlow, forming a resident trio {{to play at the}} Composer, a club on West 58th Street in New York. Farlow's comment on the absence of a drummer from the trio was that [...] "Eddie's feeding, comping or <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it was so fierce that there was no doubt at all where the time was, so I didn't miss the drums at all". The trio stayed together, recording several albums under Farlow's name, until, in 1958, the Composer closed. Costa was often in recording studios as a sideman around this time: he appeared on approximately 20 albums in both 1956 and 1957. These included small group settings with Herbie Mann, Oscar Pettiford, and Phil Woods, and accompanying vocalists such as Tony Bennett and Chris Connor.|$|E

The iTunes edition included [...] "Long Time Comin'" [...] and the music video for [...] "Sink into Me" [...] as bonus tracks. In promoting the album, Warner Bros. Senior Vice-President of Marketing Rob Gordon said the promotional campaign would accomplish two objectives: [...] "No. 1 is energizing the fan base. No. 2 is taking this band from the world of ... <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it to an arena-rock band," [...] such as the Foo Fighters. To help with the first point, the label worked with Myspace to hold listening sessions aboard the band's tour bus in various cities. The album's release was followed by a European tour in July. [...] "New Again" [...] was released as a single on July 24 with an acoustic version of [...] "Sink into Me" [...] as the B-side. In late July and early August, the band toured the UK with support from Twin Atlantic. In August and September, the band supported Blink-182 on their North American tour and performed at Virgin Mobile FreeFest. [...] "Where My Mouth Is" [...] was released to radio on September 1.

[...] Consequence of Sound credited it with shaping subsequent developments in [...] "indie R or electropop or <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> it": [...] "808s is flooded with R and it digitizes the raw emotion and isolated feelings that [...] have carved their brands out of today." [...] Craig D. Linsey from The Village Voice wrote that the album's [...] "naked humanity ... practically set off the emo-rap/r boom that everyone from Drake to Frank Ocean to The Weeknd now traffic in." [...] Marcus Scott of GIANT said rappers such as B.o.B, Drake, and Kid Cudi followed West's album with similarly-minded works, citing West's introspective, emotional themes and synthpop/"Vangelis-inspired" [...] music as influences. In the opinion of Billboard senior editor Alex Gale, the album was [...] "the equivalent of (Bob) Dylan going electric, and you still hear that all the time, in hip-hop and outside of hip-hop." [...] Drake's 2009 mixtape So Far Gone received comparisons from critics to 808s & Heartbreak. Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times cited 808s & Heartbreak as [...] "the template [...] for essentially the entirety of Drake's young career", and that wrote that he [...] "shares West's love for mood and never-ending existential analysis". In a 2009 interview, Drake cited West as [...] "the most influential person" [...] in shaping his own sound. In 2014, Rolling Stone named 808s & Heartbreak one of the 40 most groundbreaking albums of all time. On September 26, 2015, West performed the album in its entirety at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{reviews for}} The Tree of Life at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival were polarized.

2500|$|By May 1996, Sound on Sound was {{reporting}} that {{the popularity of the}} 808 had started to decline, with the rarer TR-909 taking its place as [...] "the dance floor drum machine to use." [...] This is thought to have arisen for a number of reasons: the 909 gives more control over the drum sounds, has better programming and includes MIDI as standard. Sound on Sound reported that the 909 was selling for between Â£900 and Â£1100 and noted that the 808 was still collectible, but maximum prices had peaked at about Â£700 to Â£800. Such prices have held in the 12 years since the article was published, this can be evidenced by a quick search on eBay.

[...] His comments, made in the run-up to a Republican primary election, were strongly criticised by a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. He said that Ramsey's comments were part of [...] "a disturbing trend in our nation in which it is suggested that American Muslims should have fewer or more restricted constitutional rights than citizens of other faiths." [...] Murfreesboro's local state Senator, Bill Ketron, subsequently introduced what The American Prospect described as [...] "one of the most extreme anti-Sharia-law bills in the country", authorizing the state attorney general to designate [...] "Sharia organizations" [...] and imposing a 15-year jail term on anyone convicted of supporting such an organization. The law was passed, but the state legislature took out direct references to Sharia and Islam.
