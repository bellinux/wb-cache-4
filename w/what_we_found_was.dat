5000|$|According to a {{study done}} on a sample of 782 healthy European couples ages 19-39, {{fertility}} starts declining after age 27 and drops at a somewhat greater rate after age 35. The women were divided into four age groups: 19-26, 27-29, 30-34 and 35-39. Statistical analysis showed that {{the women in the}} 27-29 age group had significantly less chance on average of becoming pregnant than did the 19- to 26-year-olds. Pregnancy rates did not change notably between the 27-29 age group and the 30-34 age group, but dropped significantly for the 35-39 age group. The age of the male partner {{had a significant impact on}} female fertility among the women who had reached their mid-30s, but not among the younger women. However, experts said the new study was too small and there were too many variables which were too difficult to sort out, for a clear conclusion to be drawn. Some experts suggested that the main change in fertility in the older women was the fact that it took them longer to conceive, not necessary that they were significantly more unlikely to eventually succeed. David Dunson, a biostatistician at the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, said that: [...] "Although we noted a decline in female fertility in the late 20s, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>was</b> a decrease in the probability of becoming pregnant per menstrual cycle, not in the probability of eventually achieving a pregnancy." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a first step towards {{learning}} about the implications of unemployment with regard to the combination of consumption expenditures and time use within households under the theoretical base on Becker’s (1964) household production theory. We examine the Spanish experience, where the unemployment rate was above 15 % since the early 1980 s up to the late 1990 s and, clearly, many unemployed workers were out of jobs involuntarily, hence forced to adjust their time and consumption allocation patterns accordingly. Our results, overall, seem consistent with the main prediction of the household production theory. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>is</b> that time intensive commodities (passive leisure, active leisure, housework and child care) are produced more in the households with unemployed individuals. We also find that (with the exception of single females) the proportion of consumption expenditures in time saving goods is lower in the households with unemployed individuals. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how the city’s contested political contexts are embedded into its digital layers, we traced how the city is represented on online platforms that house facts about much of the world.

40|$|This study {{expresses the}} {{solution}} of the Bessel equation in the neighbourhood of x=∞ as the product of a known-form singular divisor and a specific nonsingular function, which satisfies the corresponding derived equation. Considering the failure of the traditional irregular solution constructed with the power series, we adopt the corrected Fourier series with only limited smooth degree to approximate the nonsingular function in the interval [x 0,∞]. In order to guarantee the series’ uniform convergence and uniform approximation to the derived equation, we introduce constraint and compatibility conditions and hence completely determine all undetermined coefficients of the corrected Fourier series. Thus, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>is</b> not an asymptotic solution at x→∞ (not to mention a so-called formal solution), but a solution in the interval [x 0,∞] with certain regularities of distribution.

The present paper set out to investigate some of the factors that would have appeared obvious in influencing attitudes towards risk, such as value of options, probability of options, level of information (specifically on probability) and position of the respondent relative to the outcome of the risk (loss or gain). For this purpose we devised a survey testing each of these elements and allowing for interpretation of their interdependence. After analyzing hypothetical situations, we also investigated how these were reflected in self-assessment and real-life behavior. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>is</b> that, although these factors do play their intuitive role in fundamenting decisions in contexts of risk, they are ill correlated to one another and may themselves not be coherent across different contexts. risk aversion, decision-making, factor correlation...|$|R
