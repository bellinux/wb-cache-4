5|$|The {{following}} year Sellers {{appeared in a}} further three television series based on The Goons, which aired on Britain's new ITV channel. The series were The Idiot <b>Weekly,</b> <b>Price</b> 2d, A Show Called Fred and Son of Fred. In 1957 film producer Michael Relph became impressed with Sellers's portrayal of an elderly character in Idiot Weekly, and cast the 32-year-old actor as a 68-year-old projectionist in Basil Dearden's The Smallest Show on Earth, supporting Bill Travers, Virginia McKenna and Margaret Rutherford. The film was a commercial success and is now {{thought of as a}} minor classic of British screen comedy in the post-war era. Following this, Sellers provided the growling voice of Winston Churchill to the BAFTA award winning film The Man Who Never Was. Later in 1957 Sellers portrayed a television star with a talent for disguises in Mario Zampi's offbeat black comedy The Naked Truth, opposite Terry-Thomas, Peggy Mount, Shirley Eaton and Dennis Price.|$|E

In 1956 Geldray appeared in three television comedy shows produced by ITV and starring the Goons: The Idiot <b>Weekly,</b> <b>Price</b> 2d (broadcast 24 February – 23 April 1956), A Show Called Fred (broadcast 2–30 May 1956) and Son of Fred (broadcast 17 September – 5 November 1956). In 1957 he released an album, Goon with the Wind, which was produced by George Martin and released on the Parlophone label. Later that year, Geldray also appeared in Hancock's 43 Minutes, the Christmas edition of Hancock's Half Hour, broadcast on 23 December 1957. In 1958 the BBC proposed dropping Geldray from The Goon Show in a cost-cutting measure; Peter Sellers threatened to leave the series, and Geldray remained.|$|E

30|$|The {{prices of}} the {{agricultural}} commodities chosen by this paper often stayed constant for a long while.

2500|$|The Idiot <b>Weekly,</b> <b>Price</b> 2d, which starred Peter Sellers, was {{the first}} attempt to {{translate}} Goon Show humour to television. Made for Associated-Rediffusion during 1956 and only broadcast in the London area, it was mainly written by Milligan, with contributions from other writers in the Associated London Scripts cooperative including [...] Dave Freeman and Terry Nation, with Eric Sykes as script editor. The Idiot Weekly (1958–1962) was an Australian radio comedy series written by and starring Milligan with an Australian supporting cast including Ray Barrett and John Bluthal. It was made for the ABC during Milligan's numerous visits to Australia, where his family had emigrated. Milligan adapted some Goon Show scripts and included his Goon Show characters (notably Eccles) in many episodes. Six episodes of The Idiot Weekly were remade by the BBC as The Omar Khayyam Show in 1963.|$|E
2500|$|Milligan {{made several}} forays into {{television}} as a writer-performer, {{in addition to}} his many guest appearances on interview, variety and sketch comedy series from the 1950s to the 2000s. The Idiot <b>Weekly,</b> <b>Price</b> 2d (1956), starring Peter Sellers, was the first attempt to translate Goons humour to TV; it was followed by A Show Called Fred and Son of Fred, both made during 1956 and directed by Richard Lester, who went on to work with the Beatles. During a visit to Australia in 1958, a similar special was made for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, [...] "The Gladys Half-Hour", which also featured local actors Ray Barrett and John Bluthal, who would appear in several later Milligan projects. In 1961, Milligan co-wrote two episodes of the popular sitcom Sykes and a..., co-starring Sykes and Hattie Jacques and the one-off [...] "Spike Milligan Offers A Series of Unrelated Incidents at Market Value".|$|E

30|$|We can {{see from}} the figures that the {{forecasting}} results of <b>weekly</b> <b>prices</b> trend are nearly consistent with the real data.

40|$|The {{world market}} price of many {{commodities}} including US corn (maize) peaked sharply in 2008.

In this paper we report analysis of <b>weekly</b> <b>prices</b> of corn, wheat, sugar and crude oil, together with monthly series derived from those and other <b>weekly</b> <b>prices,</b> for two consecutive seven year periods: 1999 - 2005 and 2006 - 2012. We find strong evidence of cointegration between prices in both series, but only weak evidence of causation.

40|$|We {{assess the}} {{importance}} of nominal rigidities using a new weekly scanner data set from a major U. S. retailer, that contains information on prices, quantities, and costs for over 1, 000 stores. We find that nominal rigidities are important but do not {{take the form of}} sticky prices. Instead, nominal rigidities take the form of inertia in reference prices and costs, defined as the most common prices and costs within a given quarter. <b>Weekly</b> <b>prices</b> and costs fluctuate around reference values which tend to remain constant over extended periods of time. Reference prices are particularly inertial and have an average duration of roughly one year. So, nominal rigidities are present in our data, even though <b>weekly</b> <b>prices</b> change very frequently, roughly once every two weeks. We argue that the retailer chooses the frequency with which it resets references prices so as to keep the realized markups within plus/minus twenty percent of the desired markup over reference cost. markups; nominal cost inertia; nominal price inertia...|$|R

50|$|For example, if {{one looks}} at a longer {{time-frame}} (perhaps a 2-year chart with <b>weekly</b> <b>price</b> intervals), the current trend may appear {{as a part of a}} larger cycle (primary trend).

Although retail price wars have received much business press and some research attention, it is unclear how they affect consumer purchase behavior. This article studies an unprecedented price war in Dutch grocery retailing that started in fall 2003, initiated by the market leader to halt its sliding market share. The authors investigate the short- and longterm effects of the price war on store visits, on spending, and on the sensitivity of these decisions to <b>weekly</b> <b>prices</b> and price image. They use a unique data set with consumer hand-scan and perceptual data for a national panel of 1821 households, covering two years before and two years after the price war started. Although the price war initially entailed more shopping around and increased spending, spending per visit ultimately dropped because consumers redistributed their purchases across stores. The price war made consumers more sensitive to <b>weekly</b> <b>prices</b> and price image, which helped both the chain that showed an improvement in price image (the price war initiator) and the chains that already had a favorable price image (hard discounters). The price war initiator managed to halt the slide in its market share, and its stock price improved. The losers were the rival mid-level and high-end chains. Unlike the initiator, their price image did not improve, and they suffered from increased price image sensitivity. The authors provide managerial implications for firms that are (or about to be) involved in a price war. Marketing Science Institute; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Researc...|$|R

Therefore, this paper proposes a price change warning model to quantify the intensity of possible price changes by the output values.|$|R
