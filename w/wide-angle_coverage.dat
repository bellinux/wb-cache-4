50|$|The EasyShare P880 was a {{high-end}} bridge digital camera from Kodak. It was announced August 2, 2005, within the Performance series. Its siblings are the P850 and the P712. The P880, however, possesses the largest optical sensor {{of all three}} models, with a size of 1/1.8 inches. Distinguishing features include a <b>wide-angle</b> <b>coverage</b> of 24 mm (35 mm equivalent), on screen histogram display, and manual focus-by-wire. In terms of the Kodak product line and price the Performance series are the most sophisticated EasyShare cameras, just below the considerably more expensive Kodak professional DCS pro SLR digital cameras that were discontinued in May 2005.|$|E
40|$|Conformal arrays are {{the most}} general type of phased array,and {{can be defined as}} an array whose {{elements}} conform to the non-planar surface. They have applications in arrays for missiles, submarines,ships,high speed aircraft, and also in systems that require <b>wide-angle</b> <b>coverage.</b> In the present report, simulation study for the pattern synthesis of circular aperture, circular arrays,Hexagonal and cylindrical arrays is carried out. The beam patterns are generated for these planar and non-planar arrays using different amplitude distributions viz. uniform, Taylor,Dolph-Chebyshev. Villeneuve excitation. The concept of phase modes is also included in the code development for circular and cylindrical arrays. Results obtained are validated against those available in open literature...|$|E

The objective is to provide the capability of effective high-resolution full-view monitoring and sensing. The optical component, formed by a multi-camera array, {{is responsible for the}} main interface with human users. The acoustical and microwave arrays are integrated, allowing the system to function in the event-triggered modality for optimal efficiency. In this paper, the arrays discussed are in circular configurations. With minor modification, the system can also function with linear array configurations...|$|E
40|$|Documentation of {{cultural}} heritage sites can provide data and records for continuing research, analysis, monitoring, and change detection. Digital documentation allows computational analysis {{as well as}} archival recording of objects and sites. It provides a nondestructive approach to artifact or site mapping and measurement. Virtual models {{of cultural}} sites can be created from digital imagery, using widely available non-metric digital cameras and video recorders. Software, such as PhotoModeler ® allows the construction of three-dimensional virtual modeling of objects, sites, and rooms by using multiple digital photographs. Methods for constructing virtual models currently require multiple photos from varying angles to provide sufficient ground control points as well as ample coverage of the site. Use of an extreme wide-angle lens camera, such as the Nikon fish eye lens, can overcome the need for numerous pictures and allows the capture of more information per image. This can speed the process of documentation while also providing more <b>coverage.</b> <b>Wide-angle</b> lenses have not been previously used due to the difficulty in registering the extreme distortion {{on the edges of}} the lenses. A project was undertaken to calibrate such a lens and to test its effectiveness in capturing images for virtual reconstruction using PhotoModeler software. The lens used was a Nikon fish-eye lens, mounted on a Nikon Coolpix camera. Two sites were selected for the test. The first was the interior of a modern building with a large three-story atrium. This site was chosen to initially calibrate the camera and lens for the software. The second site selected was the Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument, a complex of archaeological sites used to test the effectiveness of the camera, lens, and PhotoModele...|$|R
40|$|In A 0 - 1 we {{proposed}} an ambitious long-term survey of selected regions of our Galaxy (the XGPS survey) using the EPIC CCD cameras on XMM-Newton. The {{first phase of}} the programme, which aims to survey a strip of the Galactic Plane in the Scutum region, is currently underway. Here we report on the preliminary results from the first 15 survey pointings. We show that the XGPS survey strategy of fairly shallow (5 - 10 ks) exposures but <b>wide-angle</b> <b>coverage</b> is well tuned to the goal of providing a large catalogue of predominantly Galactic sources at relatively faint X-ray fluxes in the hard 2 - 6 keV band.

40|$|We {{comment on}} the {{important}} phenomenological aspects of the recent high-statistics and <b>wide-angle</b> <b>coverage</b> ϕ photoproduction data from CLAS at Jefferson Lab. The most prominent feature is a localized structure at a center-of-mass (c. m) energy √(s) ∼ 2. 2 GeV that is not expected in a simple t-channel Pomeron-exchange model. The structure exists only at the forward production angles that almost rules out any resonance contribution. Strong rescattering effects between the p ϕ and K^+Λ(1520) channels could be possible explanations. The analyses of both charged- (ϕ→ K^+ K^-) and neutral- (ϕ→ K^ 0 _S K^ 0 _L) KK̅ decay modes of the ϕ, that show some minor differences, can be illuminating in this respect. We also {{comment on the}} angular structure of the Pomeron-parton coupling as borne out in the polarization data where the often-asumed s-channel helicity conservation is seen to be broken...|$|E
40|$|The human {{ability to}} derive Control-Oriented Visual Field Information from teleoperated Helmet-Mounted {{displays}} in Nap-of-the-Earth flight, is investigated. The visual field with {{these types of}} displays originates from a Forward Looking Infrared Radiation Camera, gimbal-mounted {{at the front of}} the aircraft and slaved to the pilot's line-of-sight, to obtain wide-angle visual coverage. Although these displays are proved to be effective in Apache and Cobra helicopter night operations, they demand very high pilot proficiency and work load. Experimental work presented in the paper has shown that part of the difficulties encountered in vehicular control by means of these displays can be attributed to the narrow viewing aperture and head/camera slaving system phase lags. Both these shortcomings will impair visuo-vestibular coordination, when voluntary head rotation is present. This might result in errors in estimating the Control-Oriented Visual Field Information vital in vehicular control, such as the vehicle yaw rate or the anticipated flight path, or might even lead to visuo-vestibular conflicts (motion sickness). Since, under these conditions, the pilot will tend to minimize head rotation, the full <b>wide-angle</b> <b>coverage</b> of the Helmet-Mounted Display, provided by the line-of-sight slaving system, is not always fully utilized...|$|E
40|$|Hotspot: The Snake River Geothermal Drilling Project was {{undertaken}} {{to better understand}} geothermal systems across the Snake River Plain volcanic province. A series of surface and borehole seismic profiles were obtained to provide insights into volcanic stratigraphy and test the capabilities of engineering-scale seismic imaging in such terranes. The Kimberly site drilled through 1. 9 km of mostly rhyolite, with thin sedimentary interbeds in {{the upper part of}} the section. The Kimama site drilled through 1. 9 km of mostly basalt with sedimentary interbeds at ∼ 200 m depth and 1700 m depth. The Mountain Home site contained numerous sediment and volcanic rock layers. Downhole and surface vibroseis seismic results suggest sedimentary interbeds at depth correspond with low-velocity, high-temperature zones that relate to reflections on seismic profiles. Our results suggest that eruption flow volumes can be estimated and flow boundaries can be imaged with surface seismic methods using relatively high-fold and <b>wide-angle</b> <b>coverage.</b> High-frequency attenuation is observed at all sites, and this deficit may be countered by acquisition design and a focus on signal processing steps. Separation of surface and body waves was obtained by muting, and the potential for large static effects was identified and addressed in processing. An accurate velocity model and lithology contacts derived from borehole information improved the confidence of our seismic interpretations...|$|E
40|$|Wide-angle seismic lines {{recorded}} by ocean bottom and land seismometers provide a pseudo three dimensional {{investigation of the}} crust and upper mantle structure around the volcanically active hotspot island of La Réunion. The submarine part of the edifice has fairly low seismic velocities, without evidence for intrusives. An upper unit with a velocity-depth gradient is interpreted as made of material erupted subaerially then transported and compacted downslope. Between this unit {{and the top of}} the oceanic plate, imaged by normal incidence seismic reflection, a more homogeneous unit indicated by shadow zones on several wide-angle sections may correspond to lavas of a different nature, extruded underwater in the earlier phase of volcanism. Coincident wide angle and normal incidence reflections document that the oceanic plate is not generally downwarping toward the island but doming instead toward its southeastern part, with limited evidence for some intracrustal intrusion. Deeper in the lithosphere, the presence of a layer of intermediate velocity between the crust and the mantle is firmly established. It is interpreted as resulting from the advection of hotspot magmatic products. Possibly partially molten, and of a composition for which the crust is a density barrier. The extensive <b>wide-angle</b> <b>coverage</b> constrains the extent of this body. It does not show the elongated shape expected from plate drift above a steady hotspot supply. Alternative propositions can hence be considered, for example, that La Réunion is caused by a solitary wave of hotspot material or by a young hotspot. The size of the underplate, 140 km wide and up to 3 km thick, corresponds to less than half the volume of the edifice on top of the plate. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 18 - 20, 1977 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaOver {{the past}} few years new and unique types of cavity-backed, slot antennas have been {{developed}} that mount flush to the surface of a missile. These antennas have been designed and built to operate in the 300 MHz to 3 GHz frequency range and to produce low-gain (typically isotropic) <b>wide-angle</b> <b>coverage</b> with moderate radiation efficiency. As well as insuring good electrical performance, the basic design employs a copper-clad, dielectric-loaded cavity into which the radiating slot is machined or etched. This construction technique provides four important advantages: (1) The almost arbitrary shape or form factor of the cavity allows flush mounting {{to the surface of the}} missile or sandwiching between internal components with only the radiating slot exposed to the exterior of the missile. (2) Fabrication is simple. (3) Cost is low. (4) Mechanical strength is high. The cavity backing the slot is filled with a moderately high, dielectric constant material (such as a silicone, Teflon, or epoxy fiberglass) with a relative permittivity in the 2. 5 to 4. 5 range to decrease the size of the cavity and to provide mechanical strength to the antenna. The RF connection to the cavity is made by an inductive post and a coaxial connector. A 50 ohm input impedance is obtained over frequency bandwidths of 3 to 10 percent. By connecting two or more of these slot antennas together in a prescribed phase and amplitude relation, the direction of the radiation pattern can be controlled. Sidelooking or forward-looking patterns are possible by simple changes in feed network cable connections. The easy tunability of one of these new types of antennas allows application over greater than a 2 : 1 frequency range without any change in antenna dimensions...|$|E
