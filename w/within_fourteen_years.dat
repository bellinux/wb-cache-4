2500|$|Aaron Lopez is {{credited}} with making Newport an important center of trade. [...] "To him in a larger degree than to any one else was due the rapid commercial development which made Newport {{for a quarter of}} a century afterward the most formidable rival of New York." [...] He induced 40 Portuguese Jewish families to settle there and, <b>within</b> <b>fourteen</b> <b>years</b> of Lopez's activity, Newport had 150 vessels engaged in trade. He was involved in the slave trade and manufactured spermaceti candles, ships, barrels, rum, chocolate, textiles, clothes, shoes, hats, and bottles. [...] He became the wealthiest man in Newport but was denied citizenship on religious grounds, even though British law protected the rights of Jews to become citizens. He appealed to the Rhode Island legislature for redress and was refused with this ruling: [...] "Inasmuch as the said Aaron Lopez hath declared himself by religion a Jew, this Assembly doth not admit himself nor any other of that religion to the full freedom of this Colony. So that the said Aaron Lopez nor any other of said religion is not liable to be chosen into any office in this colony nor allowed to give vote as a free man in choosing others."

6000|$|I {{think the}} {{component}} parts of English {{were in the}} latter years of Elizabeth thus exquisitely proportioned one to the other. Yet Bacon had no faith in his mother-tongue, translating the works on which his fame was to rest into what he called [...] "the universal language," [...] and affirming that [...] "English would bankrupt all our books." [...] He was deemed a master of it, nevertheless; and it is curious that Ben Jonson applies to him in prose the same commendation which he gave Shakespeare in verse, saying, that he [...] "performed that in our tongue which may be compared or preferred either to insolent Greece or haughty Rome"; and he adds this pregnant sentence: [...] "In short, within his view and about his time were all the wits born that could honor a language or help study. Now things daily fall: wits grow downwards, eloquence grows backwards." [...] Ben had good reason for what {{he said of the}} wits. Not to speak of science, of Galileo and Kepler, the sixteenth century was a spendthrift of literary genius. An attack of immortality in a family might have been looked for then as scarlet-fever would be now. Montaigne, Tasso, and Cervantes were born <b>within</b> <b>fourteen</b> <b>years</b> of each other; and in England, while Spenser was still delving over the propria quae maribus, and Raleigh launching paper navies, Shakespeare was stretching his baby hands for the moon, and the little Bacon, chewing on his coral, had discovered that impenetrability was one quality of matter. It almost takes one's breath away to think that [...] "Hamlet" [...] and the [...] "Novum Organon" [...] were at the risk of teething and measles at the same time. But Ben was right also in thinking that eloquence had grown backwards. He lived long enough to see the language of verse become in a measure traditionary and conventional. It was becoming so, partly from the necessary order of events, partly because the most natural and intense expression of feeling had been in so many ways satisfied and exhausted,--but chiefly because there was no man left to whom, as to Shakespeare, perfect conception gave perfection of phrase. Dante, among modern poets, his only rival in condensed force, says: [...] "Optimis conceptionibus optima loquela conveniet; sed optimae conceptiones non possunt esse nisi ubi scientia et ingenium est; ... et sic non omnibus versificantibus optima loquela convenit, cum plerique sine scientiâ et ingenio versificantur."[125] ...|$|E

Although Huang went abroad to Japan {{two years after}} the marriage, <b>within</b> the <b>fourteen</b> <b>years</b> of their marriage, Wang bore seven children. Only three boys and two girls were still living when Wang passed away in 1916. She unequivocally supported Huang's political stance and teaching career and took care of their children. She was praised as a great partner. However, during the long distance marriage, Huang went to Shanghai in pursuit of Huang Shaolan (黄绍兰), who was also a student of Zhang Taiyan. He convinced her to marry him using a fake name. She complied because he could not have gotten married with the same identity twice. She regretted the decision once Huang went back to Beijing and started dating a student of his, Peng (彭, this is only a last name). Huang Shaolan's father then disowned her because of the scandal. Consequently, she suffered greatly from mental illness and eventually hung herself. Zhang Taiyan's wife, Tang Guoli (汤国梨), expressed great sympathy for Huang Shaolan and publically detested Huang Kan's [...] "immoral conduct" [...] in her writings. Zhang Taiyan, on the other hand, excused his favourite student for such behavior for [...] "any great scholar or artist cannot be perfect." ...|$|R

40|$|The 1821 {{creation}} of a written syllabary for the Cherokee language by Sequoyah and its use in the Nation’s newspaper, the Cherokee Phoenix, are routinely examined {{within the context of}} the tribe’s discourse surrounding removal in the 1830 s, but scholars often overlook the influence of the missionary Samuel Austin Worcester and the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) in shaping the parameters of that discourse by arranging the syllabary, typesetting the characters, and establishing the press. This article illuminates these significant historical and technical aspects of Worcester’s influence on the {{creation of}} Cherokee print. Worcester’s influence on the Cherokee syllabary is important, given the enduring nature of his influence and the rapid adoption of the written language: <b>within</b> <b>fourteen</b> <b>years</b> of its introduction, and seven years of the first printing, more than half of all households in the Cherokee Nation had a reader of Cherokee.
