25|$|According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Spinoza's God is an “infinite intellect” (Ethics 2p11c) — all knowing (2p3), {{and capable}} of loving both himself—and us, insofar as {{we are part of}} his {{perfection}} (5p35c). And if the mark of a personal being is that it is one towards which we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too that Spinoza recommends amor intellectualis dei (the intellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man (5p33). However, the matter is complex. Spinoza's God does not have free will (1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1 appendix), and Spinoza insists that “neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God” (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that God is really not the kind of being who could ever love us back. “He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return,” says Spinoza (5p19).|$|E

5000|$|Roediger {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{scholars}} to see the value of studying how humans retrieve memories. As Roediger started his career the cognitive revolution was in full swing. Human memory researchers had been predominantly focusing on memory storage, and were only beginning to look at memory encoding. However, inspired by his graduate advisor at Yale, Robert G. Crowder, Roediger began to see the importance of a retrieval-based approach to memory research. [...] Since his doctoral dissertation, much of Roediger's research through the 1970s focused on retrieval based inhibition - the idea that retrieving an item reduces the subsequent accessibility of other stored items. This phenomenon is more commonly experienced when we try <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> a list of items and find that we keep thinking of the ones we have already recalled, rather than the ones <b>we</b> still <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember.</b> Roediger was able to show, under certain conditions, that recall cues can inhibit recall, which seemed inconsistent with previously widely accepted research findings showing that cues aid recall. Close to a decade of research helped to define the situations in which cues can aid recall and the situations in which cues can inhibit recall. In 1978 Roediger concluded that this dissociation occurs because, although some cues can facilitate recall, other cues provide irrelevant information, which hinders recall. Most importantly, Roediger showed the world that the accessibility of one memory biases the process of searching for another memory.|$|R

Here we pioneer an fMRI paradigm that enables examination of both sustained and transient processes engaged during time-based PM. Participants were scanned while performing a demanding on-going task (n-back working memory), with and without an additional time-based PM demand. During the PM condition participants could access a hidden clock with a specific button-press response, while in the control condition, pseudo-clocks randomly appeared and were removed via the same response. Analyses tested for sustained activation associated with the PM condition, and also transient activation associated with clock-checks and the PM target response. Contrary to prior findings with event-based PM (i. e., <b>remembering</b> <b>to</b> perform a future action when a specific event occurs), no sustained PM-related activity was observed in anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) or elsewhere in the brain; instead, transient clock-related activity was observed in this region. Critically, the activation was anticipatory, increasing before clock-check responses. Anticipatory activity prior to the PM target response was weaker in aPFC, but strong in pre-Supplementary Motor Area (pre-SMA; relative to clock-check responses), suggesting a functional double dissociation related to volitional decision-making. Together, the results suggest that aPFC-activity dynamics during time-based PM reflect a distinct transient monitorin...|$|R

In this paper we create a cognitive model to describe the creation of end-user generated passwords that may be applied particularly during an attempt to forensically recover such passwords. We propose that it may be feasible to recover a password by reversing the logic of its creation, taking into account contextual and other parameters, instead of applying computationally expensive brute force. 1...|$|R

5000|$|So the {{question}} is, how do signifiers create meaning {{and how do}} we know what that meaning is? In order to understand how the signifier and signified relate to each other, one must be able to interpret signs. [...] "The only reason that the signifier does entail the signified is because there is a conventional relationship at play". That is, a sign can only be understood when {{the relationship between the two}} components that make up the sign are agreed upon. Saussure argued that a sign's [...] "meaning depends on its relation to other words within the system" [...] (for example, to understand an individual word such as [...] "tree", one must also understand the word [...] "bush" [...] and how the two relate to each other). It is this difference from other signs that allows the possibility of a speech community. However <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that signifiers and their significance change all the time, becoming [...] "dated". It is in this way that we are all [...] "practicing semioticians who pay a great deal of attention to signs… even though we may never have heard them before" [...] And while words are the most familiar form signs take, they stand for many things within life, such as advertisement, objects, body language, music, and so on. Therefore the use of signs, and the two components that make up a sign, can be and are - whether consciously or not - applied to everyday life.|$|E

Individuals sometimes forget to perform intentions in safety-critical work contexts. Holding intentions can also interfere with ongoing tasks. We applied theories and methods from the experimental literature to test the effectiveness of external aids in reducing prospective memory error and costs to ongoing tasks in an air traffic control simulation. Participants were trained to accept and hand-off aircraft and to detect aircraft conflicts. For the prospective memory task, participants were required to substitute alternative actions for routine actions when accepting target aircraft. Across two experiments, external display aids were provided that presented the details of target aircraft and associated intended actions. We predicted that aids would only be effective if they provided information that was diagnostic of target occurrence, and in this study, we examined the utility of aids that directly cued participants when to allocate attention to the prospective memory task. When aids were set to flash when the prospective memory target aircraft <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> be accepted, prospective memory error and costs to ongoing tasks of aircraft acceptance and conflict detection were reduced. In contrast, aids that did not alert participants specifically when the target aircraft were present provided no advantage compared to when no aids were used. These findings have practical implications for the potential relative utility of automated external aids for occupations where individuals monitor multi-item dynamic displays. Shayne Loft, Rebekah E.

Global geographies been subject to colonial translocation for centuries. Flora and fauna have been moved across continents and geographic topographies have been replicated for both economic and nostalgic purposes. This literal and metaphorical uprooting of objects from the ‘natural’ world has led to the Wunderkammer, the Cabinet of Curiosities and more recently, the natural history museum. All of which mediate our (mis) understandings of these objects, and the biodiversity that they were taken from. The contemporary artists discussed include Tania Kovats, Angela Palmer and Bryndis Snaebjornsdottir & Mark Wilson.
