(10/183. Loudon's 'Gardener's Magazine' volume 11 1835 page 427; also Journal of Horticulture' April 14, 1863 page 275.) At about the same period, namely in 1813 or 1814, Lord Gambier collected some wild plants, and his gardener, Mr. Thomson, cultivated them, together with some common garden varieties, and soon effected a great improvement. The first great change was the conversion of the dark lines in the centre of the flower into a dark eye or centre, which at that period had never been seen, but is now considered one of the chief requisites of a first-rate flower. In 1835 a book entirely devoted to this flower was published, and four hundred named varieties were on sale. From these circumstances this plant seemed to me worth studying, more especially from the great contrast between the small, dull, elongated, irregular flowers of the <b>wild</b> <b>pansy,</b> and the beautiful, flat, symmetrical, circular, velvet-like flowers, more than two inches in diameter, magnificently and variously coloured, which are exhibited at our shows. But when I came to enquire more closely, I found that, though the varieties were so modern, yet that much confusion and doubt prevailed about their parentage. Florists believe that the varieties (10/184. Loudon's 'Gardener's Magazine' volume 8 page 575: volume 9 page 689.) are descended from several wild stocks, namely, V. tricolor, lutea, grandiflora, amoena, and altaica, more or less intercrossed. And when I looked to botanical works to ascertain whether these forms ought to be ranked as species, I found equal doubt and confusion. Viola altaica seems to be a distinct form, but what part it has played in the origin of our varieties I know not; it is said to have been crossed with V. lutea. Viola amoena (10/185. Sir J.E. Smith 'English Flora' volume 1 page 306. H.C. Watson 'Cybele Britannica' volume 1 1847 page 181.) is now looked at by all botanists as a natural variety of V. grandiflora; and this and V. sudetica have been proved to be identical with V. lutea. The latter and V. tricolor (including its admitted variety V. arvensis) are ranked as distinct species by Babington, and likewise by M. Gay (10/186. Quoted from 'Annales des Sciences' in the Companion to the 'Bot. Mag.' volume 1 1835 page 159.) who has paid particular attention to the genus; but the specific distinction between V. lutea and tricolor is chiefly grounded on the one being strictly and the other not strictly perennial, as well as on some other slight and unimportant differences in the form of the stem and stipules. Bentham unites these two forms; and a high authority on such matters, Mr. H.C. Watson (10/187. 'Cybele Britannica' volume 1 page 173. See also Dr. Herbert on the changes of colour in transplanted specimens, and on the natural variations of V. grandiflora, in 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 4 page 19.) says that, [...] "while V. tricolor passes into V. arvensis on the one side, it approximates so much towards V. lutea and V. Curtisii on the other side, that a distinction becomes scarcely more easy between them." ...|$|E

These ten {{species will}} include, noting {{here and there}} a local variety, all the forms which are {{familiar}} to us in Northern Europe, except only two;--these, as it singularly chances, being the Viola Alpium, noblest of all the <b>wild</b> <b>pansies</b> in the world, so far as I have seen or heard of them,--of which, consequently, I find no picture, nor notice, in any botanical work whatsoever; and the other, the rock-violet of our own Yorkshire hills.|$|R

The wildflowers in the park's high meadows include <b>wild</b> <b>pansies,</b> gentians, martagon lilies, and alpenroses. The park has many rocky habitats. They are mostly located above the timberline and alpine pastures. These areas have rock and detritus on their surface. Alpine plants have adapted to these habitats by assuming characteristics like dwarfism, hairiness, bright coloured flowers, and highly developed roots.

5000|$|In 1962, Lévi-Strauss {{published}} what is {{for many}} people his most important work, La Pensée Sauvage, translated into English as The Savage Mind. The French title is an untranslatable pun because the word pensée means both [...] "thought" [...] and [...] "pansy", while sauvage has a range of meanings different from English [...] "savage". Lévi-Strauss supposedly suggested that the English title be Pansies for Thought, borrowing from a speech by Ophelia in Shakespeare's Hamlet (ACT IV, Scene V). French editions of La Pensée Sauvage are often printed with an image of <b>wild</b> <b>pansies</b> on the cover.|$|R

50|$|Viola bicolor, {{commonly}} known as the American field pansy or <b>wild</b> <b>pansy,</b> is an annual plant in the violet family found throughout much of North America. There is some debate as to whether the plant is native here, or if it was introduced from the Old World as a variety of Viola kitaibeliana, but it is now generally thought to be native to the North America. It is common in disturbed habitats, but is also found in fields and open woods on substrates ranging from sandy soil to clay to limestone.|$|E

I must set about my business, at any rate, in my own way, now, as I best can, looking first at things themselves, and then putting this and that together, out of these botanical persons, which they can't put together out of themselves. And first, I go down into my kitchen garden, where {{the path to the}} lake has a border of pansies on both sides all the way down, with clusters of narcissus behind them. And pulling up a handful of pansies by the roots, I find them [...] "without stems," [...] indeed, if a stem means a wooden thing; but I should say, for a low-growing flower, quiet lankily and disagreeably stalky! And, thinking over what I remember about <b>wild</b> <b>pansies,</b> I find an impression on my mind of their being rather more stalky, always, than is quite graceful; and, for all their fine flowers, having rather a weedy and littery look, and getting into places where they have no business.

But, in {{laying out}} the garden which is to assist {{the effect of the}} building, we must observe, and {{exclusively}} use, the natural combinations of flowers.[42] Now, as far as we are aware, bluish purple is the only flower color which Nature ever uses in masses of distant effect; this, however, she does in the case of most heathers, with the Rhododendron ferrugineum, and, less extensively, with the colder color of the wood hyacinth. Accordingly, the large rhododendron may be used to almost any extent, in masses; the pale varieties of the rose more sparingly; and, on the turf, the <b>wild</b> violet and <b>pansy</b> should be sown by chance, so that they may grow in undulations of color, and should be relieved by a few primroses. All dahlias, tulips, ranunculi, and, in general, what are called florist's flowers, should be avoided like garlic.|$|R
50|$|The {{first section}} {{of the book is}} almost {{certainly}} herbal, but attempts have failed to identify the plants, either with actual specimens or with the stylized drawings of contemporaneous herbals. Only a few of the plant drawings can be identified with reasonable certainty, such as a <b>wild</b> <b>pansy</b> and the maidenhair fern. The herbal pictures that match pharmacological sketches appear to be clean copies of them, except that missing parts were completed with improbable-looking details. In fact, many of the plant drawings in the herbal section seem to be composite: the roots of one species have been fastened to the leaves of another, with flowers from a third.|$|E
50|$|Love-in-idleness {{is another}} name for the European <b>wild</b> <b>pansy,</b> Viola tricolor, which {{naturally}} occurs in white and purple colors. According to Roman mythology, the <b>wild</b> <b>pansy</b> turned into the Love-in-idleness as Cupid shot one of his arrows at the imperial votaress, but missed and instead struck it. As Cupid is the god of desire, affection and erotic love, the flower’s juice received the trait, to act as a love potion. Its name relates {{to the use of the}} flower, as it is often used for idleness or vileness acts. In A Midsummer Night's Dream, the Love-in-idleness is especially used in relation to the theme of love. In Act II and III, Oberon’s and Puck’s intervention with the magic love potion of the flower, they can control the fates of various characters, but also speed up the process of falling in and out of love, so that the actual romances of the lovers and their love itself appears to become very comical. Shakespeare uses the flower to provide the essential dramatic and comical features for his play. Besides that the love potion gained from the flower, does not only interfere with the lovers fates, but also gives the play structure as it affects the plot of the lovers romances drastically, as it at first upsets the balance of love and creates asymmetrical love among the four Athenian lovers. The fact that this flower introduces magical love to this play creates the potential for many possible outcomes for this play.|$|E
40|$|Hierarchically {{structured}} flower leaves (petals) of {{many plants}} are superhydrophobic, but water droplets do not roll-off when the surfaces are tilted. On such surfaces water droplets {{are in the}} &# 8220;Cassie impregnating wetting state&# 8221;, which {{is also known as}} the &# 8220;petal effect&# 8221;. By analyzing the petal surfaces of different species, we discovered interesting new wetting characteristics of the surface of the flower of the <b>wild</b> <b>pansy</b> (Viola tricolor). This surface is superhydrophobic with a static contact angle of 169 &# 176; and very low hysteresis, i. e., the petal effect does not exist and water droplets roll-off as from a lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) leaf. However, the surface of the <b>wild</b> <b>pansy</b> petal does not possess the wax crystals of the lotus leaf. Its petals exhibit high cone-shaped cells (average size 40 &# 181;m) with a high aspect ratio (2. 1) and a very fine cuticular folding (width 260 nm) on top. The applied water droplets are in the Cassie&# 8211;Baxter wetting state and roll-off at inclination angles below 5 &# 176;. Fabricated hydrophobic polymer replicas of the <b>wild</b> <b>pansy</b> were prepared in an easy two-step moulding process and possess the same wetting characteristics as the original flowers. In this work we present a technical surface with a new superhydrophobic, low adhesive surface design, which combines the hierarchical structuring of petals with a wetting behavior {{similar to that of the}} lotus leaf...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims. Viola tricolor L. (heartsease, <b>wild</b> <b>pansy)</b> is a {{valuable}} medicinal plant obtained for pharmaceutical purposes by cultivation. Given that the species is usually strongly colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), we tested in a pot experiment whether these microorganisms were able to influence V. tricolor mass, vitality, and the concentrations of selected elements, phenolic acids and flavonoids. Methods. The following treatments were prepared: (1) control: sterile soil without AMF inoculation; (2) Rhizophagus irregularis BEG 144; (3) Funneliformis mosseae BEG 12; and (4) both isolates. Using a combination of physiological, phytochemical and biophysical methods, we evaluated {{the effects of these}} AMF on the performance of heartsease. Results. The intensity of mycorrhizal colonization and arbuscule formation was higher when F. mosseae and R. irregularis were introduced separately than when both isolates were present. None of the AMF treatments had an impact either on V. tricolor vitality as expressed by photosynthetic performance index (PI) or on its shoot and root mass. However, in general, a negative correlation was found between the extent of mycorrhizal colonization and shoot mass. We found AMF species specificities in their influence on element, phenolic acid and flavonoid concentrations. Viola tricolor showed no response to F. mosseae. The plants inoculated with R. irregularis had higher concentrations of P, Zn, Mg, and Ca, as well as p-hydroxybenzoic acid and rutin, in comparison to control. Dual AMF species inoculation increased concentrations of Cu, Mg and rutin. Conclusions. The enhanced production of secondary metabolites in V. tricolor shoots may be due to improved mineral nutrition by AMF and/or a result of general plant defense reaction to fungal colonization. The tendency towards biomass decrease in AMF treatments could be explained by the allocation of plant carbon both to the maintenance of symbionts and enhanced production of secondary compounds...|$|E
