Pumps within the mountain push the water over at the rate of 35,000 gallons a minute. This water helped cool the park's air conditioning units, stored in a 100 by 40 foot room inside the mountain. The waterfall itself is named Victoria Falls, and was reportedly based on Victoria Falls, the largest waterfall in the world, which straddles the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. In 2011, the park's [...] "Victoria Falls" [...] was still listed as powering its air conditioning. The mountain itself was slow to be named. Park publicist Mike Filey suggested in July 1980 that it might be named after Canadian-born Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook. Beaverbrook is typically associated with New Brunswick, where he moved at age 13 and started his first newspaper, and with the United Kingdom, where he became a newspaper baron. The Globe and Mail speculated that it might be named Mount Maple, to soothe relations with the local community, or that there might be a naming contest.|$|E

2500|$|The hole walls for boards {{with two}} or more layers can be made {{conductive}} and then electroplated with copper to form plated-through holes. [...] These holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB. For multi-layer boards, those <b>with</b> <b>three</b> <b>layers</b> or more, drilling typically produces a smear of the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system. Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical de-smear process, or by plasma-etch. The de-smear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through. On high reliability boards a process called etch-back is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma. [...] The etch-back removes resin and the glass fibers so that the copper layers extend into the hole and as the hole is plated become integral with the deposited copper.|$|E
