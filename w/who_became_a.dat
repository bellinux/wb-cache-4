5|$|According to {{the disputed}} {{statements}} of the ancient writers and some modern scholars, in Athens Aspasia became a hetaera and probably ran a brothel.

They were the nearest thing perhaps to liberated women; and Aspasia, <b>who</b> <b>became</b> <b>a</b> vivid figure in Athenian society, was probably an obvious example. According to Plutarch, Aspasia was compared to the famous Thargelia, another renowned Ionian hetaera of ancient times.|$|E
