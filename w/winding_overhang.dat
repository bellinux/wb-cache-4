40|$|The {{computation}} of end coil leakage inductances {{of electric}} machines is a challenging task {{due to the}} complicated leakage flux 3 D distribution in the <b>winding</b> <b>overhang</b> region. In this paper the problem is addressed of computing the field circuit leakage inductance of round-rotor synchronous machines. The proposed method is fully analytical and descends from the symbolical solution of Neumann integrals applied to the computation of self and mutual inductances combined with the method of mirror images to account for core effects. With respect to existing analytical approaches, the methodology requires neither numerical integral solutions nor discretizing the end-coil geometry into small straight elements. The accuracy of the proposed technique for computing the mutual inductance between two single end turns is assessed against measurements on a dedicated experimental set-up. The extension of the method to the computation of the entire field-circuit end-coil leakage inductance is assessed by comparison with 3 D finite element analysis (FEA) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research into}} the design of brushless permanent magnet (BPM) interior rotor synchronous servomotor for both performance and manufacturability. The investigation has been supported by experimental evidence gathered {{with the aid of}} two prototype servomotors, having the same frame sizes and stator stack lengths, designed by the author and manufactured by the sponsoring company, Control Techniques Dynamics (CTD) Ltd. One servomotor, upon which the research is focussed, has the relatively new segmented stator structure containing concentrated windings. The other servomotor has a conventional structure with a solid stator containing distributed windings and this has provided the means of assessing the degree of improvement attainable with the new structure. It has been established that the new structure enables more cost-effective manufacture than attainable with the conventional structure. A significant contribution of the research programme is the special notch for retention of the surface mounted permanent magnets in the rotor. This innovation enables a more uniform and smaller air gap, which greatly improves the dynamic and thermal performance for a given frame size and stator stack length, thereby advancing the state of the art. This, together with the greatly reduced stator <b>winding</b> <b>overhang</b> in the new structure, enables a physically smaller motor for a given application, thereby reducing active material usage. Also the design methodology has focused on reducing energy and eliminating waste in the manufacturing process. Regarding the thermal aspects, only natural cooling has been considered. Conduction, convection and radiation heat transfer in the servomotor has been investigated theoretically, by simulation and by experiments to identify where design improvements can be made. The most critical area identified is the paper wall insulation and comprehensive experiments have been carried out to identify the commercially available material with the highest thermal conductivity to maximise the removal of heat from the stator windings. An array of strategically located thermocouples was used to obtain temperature distributions. The performance indicators for comparison of the new and conventional servomotors are cogging torque, iron loss and dynamic torque. The cogging torque proved to iii increase with the permanent magnet retaining feature for the new servomotor and becomes unpredictable but this disadvantage was offset by material saving and its maximum torque being approximately 40...|$|E

50|$|Electric motors must be {{compact and}} lightweight. They should also deliver a higher output with less copper usage. A {{prerequisite}} {{for this is}} an appropriate design of the coil body and suitable wire dimensions. One parameter of importance for the developer of motors is the electrical fill factor. The fill factor measures the ratio between the volume of a winding package and the volume needed to house the winding package. In case of stators, {{it can be said}} that the electrical fill factor is the ratio of the content of non-ferrous metals of the stator including the stator slot to the sum of the uninsulated copper cross sections. But in contrast to round coils, only the stator slot is considered. The reason for this is that merely the conductor strands in the stator slot contribute to the torque of the motor. The <b>winding</b> <b>overhangs</b> on the narrow sides of the winding cross section of a tooth only result in unwanted losses in the form of increasing electric resistance and undesired heat development.|$|R
40|$|This Masetr thesis {{looks into}} {{weathering}} pits of nature park Česká Kanada. The theoretical {{part of the}} thesis investigates research of weathering pits done in the Czech Republic as well as abroad. The practical part deals with weathering pit-bearing as well as weathering pitabsent blocks of rock within the study area. It describes their geological-geomorphological environment and attempts to find differences between the weathering pit-bearing and absent blocks (the presence of cracks, altitude, landforms, shape of the rock block and more). Furthermore it was established that a suitable rock block morphology (respectively the existence of horizontal plane) is important for formation of weathering pits. It also studies water properties in selected weathering pits, relationship of <b>overhangs</b> to prevailing <b>wind</b> directions. A correlation between <b>overhang</b> and <b>wind</b> direction was found in sense that NW to W <b>winds</b> correspond with <b>overhang</b> formation on eastern sides of weathering pits. Water in weathering pit of Čertův kámen located in sunny bare landscape shows significantly different properties in comparison with water properties of remaining weathering pits located in forrested areas...|$|R
