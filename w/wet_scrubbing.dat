5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using anoxic zones and diffuse air activated sludge treatment. This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed incinerator. The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbing</b> system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.|$|E

50|$|While the {{contaminated}} mixture is melting, gases (called off-gases) are released, which are hazardous substances themselves. These gases are captured by a steel fume hood and sent through a treatment system that then removes about 99.9999% of the contaminants.

50|$|The {{exhaust gases}} of {{combustion}} may contain substances considered {{harmful to the}} environment, and the scrubber may remove or neutralize those. A wet scrubber is used for cleaning air, fuel gas or other gases of various pollutants and dust particles. <b>Wet</b> <b>scrubbing</b> works via the contact of target compounds or particulate matter with the scrubbing solution. Solutions may simply be water (for dust) or solutions of reagents that specifically target certain compounds.|$|E

500|$|In Tasmania, Banksia marginata {{occupies}} {{a wide range}} of habitats, in mixed forest (where it grows as a small tree), button grass moorlands, flood plains of the Loddon, Franklin and Huon Rivers, as well as coastal regions. In parts of the west and southwest of Tasmania, the species is dominant within the threatened native vegetation community known as Banksia marginata <b>wet</b> <b>scrub.</b> [...] Interestingly, there is no macrofossil record for the species, so it is unclear whether it is a recent introduction from the mainland or has only recently evolved, although its presence on both the mainland and Tasmania suggests it has been present since the Pleistocene. It grows in coastal habitats that would be occupied by Banksia integrifolia on the mainland.|$|R
50|$|Wet {{scrubbers}} capture {{relatively small}} dust particles with large liquid droplets. In most <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbing</b> systems, droplets produced are generally larger than 50 micrometres (in the 150 to 500 micrometres range). As {{a point of}} reference, human hair ranges in diameter from 50 to 100 micrometres. The size distribution of particles to be collected is source specific.For example, particles produced by mechanical means (crushing or grinding) tend to be large (above 10 micrometres); whereas, particles produced from combustion or a chemical reaction will have {{a substantial portion of}} small (less than 5 micrometres) and submicrometre particles.|$|E
5000|$|Most FGD systems employ two stages: one for fly {{ash removal}} {{and the other}} for [...] removal. Attempts have been made to remove both the fly ash and [...] in one {{scrubbing}} vessel.

In <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbing</b> systems, the flue gas normally passes first through a fly ash removal device, either an electrostatic precipitator or a baghouse, and then into the -absorber. However, in dry injection or spray drying operations, the [...] is first reacted with the sorbent, and then the flue gas passes through a particulate control device.|$|E
50|$|As of June 1973, {{there were}} 42 FGD units in operation, 36 in Japan and 6 in the United States, ranging in {{capacity}} from 5 MW to 250 MW.

About 45% of the FGD capacity was in the U.S., 24% in Germany, 11% in Japan, and 20% in various other countries.

40|$|EPA has {{identified}} <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbing</b> at low mercury feedrates, {{as well as}} carbon adsorption via carbon injection into the offgas or via flow through fixed carbon beds, as control technologies {{that can be used}} to meet the proposed Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) rule limit for mercury emissions from hazardous waste incinerators. DOE is currently funding demonstrations of gold amalgamation that may also control mercury to the desired levels. Performance data from a variety of sources was reviewed to determine ranges of achievable mercury control. Preliminary costs were estimated for using these technologies to control mercury emissions from mixed waste incineration. Mercury emissions control for mixed waste incineration may need to be more efficient than for incineration of other hazardous wastes because of higher mercury concentrations in some mixed waste streams. However, mercury control performance data for <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbing</b> and carbon adsorption is highly variable. More information is needed to demonstrate control efficiencies that are achievable under various design and operating conditions for <b>wet</b> <b>scrubbing,</b> carbon adsorption, and gold amalgamation technologies. Given certain assumptions made in this study, capital costs, operating costs, and lifecycle costs for carbon injection, carbon beds, and gold amalgamation generally vary for different assumed mercury feedrates and for different offgas flowrates. Assuming that these technologies can in fact provide the necessary mercury control performance, each of these technologies may be less costly than the others for certain mercury feedrates and the offgas flowrates...|$|E
