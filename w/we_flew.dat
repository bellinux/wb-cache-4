25|$|The {{first victory}} for the Bf 110 in this {{capacity}} was recorded on 4 February 1943 against a B-24 formation attacking Hamm. The Germans suffered from defensive fire as the Bf 110s were a bigger target. Along with the seven Fw 190s and five lost by JG 1, all eight IV./NJG 1s Bf 110s were damaged. They claimed three B-17s, although only one was lost. The reason for the failure {{was the lack of}} training in day fighter tactics. Hans-Joachim Jabs said;This was my only day victory in a night fighter. <b>We</b> <b>flew</b> these missions at no greater than Schwarm strength, and were ourselves never escorted. It was wasteful to use highly trained night fighter crews in this role, and it was given up when the US escorts appeared.|$|E

And I {{had a great deal}} of confidence in him and, you know, if he said something, that, to me, was from the Bible. You could take it to the bank." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} crash, several {{witnesses}} described seeing an aircraft flying unusually low towards the Continental Divide. Some witnesses located on higher mountainside locations, such as Loveland Pass at , reported seeing it flying below them. Crash survivor Rick Stephens {{was a senior}} guard and stated in 2013, [...] "...as <b>we</b> <b>flew</b> along over I-70, that there were old mines and old vehicles above us. I noticed we were quite a bit below {{the top of the}} mountains. [...] I got up to go to the cockpit, which wasn't unusual to do, and I could tell we were in trouble, looking out the window and seeing nothing but green in front of us." ...|$|E
2500|$|I'd {{learned to}} read Butler's body {{language}} and he was getting a little nervous as <b>we</b> <b>flew</b> {{deeper and deeper into}} Iraqi territory. The reality of what we were about to do had begun to hit him. Duelfer teased him about how the Iraqis could solve everything if they just shot us out of the sky. Butler was not amused. He kept asking probing questions, reassuring himself that these inspection targets were of a legitimate disarmament character. [...] "What makes us go to that site?" [...] he asked. How do I explain it to the Iraqis?...How do I explain this site to the Security Council?...What do we expect to find at this one?...What happens if the Iraqis stop us from entering?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{he could}} take up his post, Gott was killed when the {{transport}} plane he was traveling in was shot down and destroyed while returning to Cairo from the battle area. The aircraft, a Bristol Bombay of No. 216 Squadron RAF flown by 19-year-old Flight Sergeant Hugh [...] "Jimmy" [...] James, was intercepted and shot down by Unteroffizier Bernd Schneider and Emil Clade of Jagdgeschwader 27 (Fighter Wing 27). With both engines out, the pilot had made a successful crash landing, but two German Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters attacked the crashed plane, strafing it until the Bombay was totally wrecked. Those who were unable {{to escape from the}} downed Bombay [...] (including Gott) were killed. Gott's body was buried at the El Alamein War Cemetery. His replacement was Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery, who had been Brooke's preferred choice.

2500|$|On November 18, 2008, Blabbermouth.net {{announced}} Believer's {{signing with}} Cesspool Recordings, an imprint of Metal Blade Records owned by Howard Jones of Killswitch Engage. In {{an interview with}} Metalsucks.net, Bachman commented that the announcement about the band's re-activation had spread to the industry, and a staff member from Blabbermouth/Roadrunner Records suggested that they should contact Howard: [...] "We {{got in touch with}} him and it turns out he is a big Believer fan. He knows more about the history of Believer than we do! It was really cool. So <b>we</b> <b>flew</b> him in to the studio, we worked with him over two days. Then he mentioned that he was starting this imprint with Brian Slagel from Metal Blade and he asked us if we wanted to be the first band on it." [...] Jones forwarded the band to Slagel whom reportedly replied: [...] "Believer? Absolutely, lets do this.'" [...] "It was sort of an easy process for us as far as the business end of it was concerned," [...] Bachman stated. They signed a 3-album deal with Metal Blade.|$|E
2500|$|<b>We</b> <b>flew</b> at 13,440 feet (4,800 meters) {{above sea}} level and our speed was 540 knots. [...] A little bit after {{completing}} a turn to the northwest, we identified a patrol of four MiG-21s in spread formation {{at a distance of}} 5 miles –about 8 km- at ‘2 o’clock’ and below us. Two more MiGs appeared 2 miles –about 3 km - behind[...] [...] [...] When the MiGs crossed in front of Stone, he started to follow, breaking left and losing height. Due to that, the flight spread wide to the right, and I found myself higher and somewhat {{to the right of the}} others. I kept the throttle to the minimum during the first phase of the combat. So, when the MiGs broke to the left, and the engagement began. I chose one of the MiGs and followed him with my radar. I don't think that we ever exceeded 4G's during the whole engagement. I decided to follow the Navy pilots' tactics - at close range foregoing the radar tracking, but looking through the reticle instead. When I realized that I was in the right position, I pushed the fire button, released it, pushed it again, and waited. I did not even see the first Sparrow. However, I followed the entire trajectory of the second one, from launch to impact. I fired the missiles at less than 2,000 yards from the MiG’s tail, at a height of 9,800 feet (3,500 meters) while turning to the left. The second one hit the tail section of the enemy aircraft. A second later, I saw a huge, orange ball of fire.|$|E
