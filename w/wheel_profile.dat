40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of experimental and numerical investigations on regular wear of <b>wheel</b> <b>profiles.</b> Experimental tests were performed on a full-scale roller rig and allowed to measure the evolution of <b>wheel</b> <b>profiles</b> as well as contact forces and several quantities describing the motion of the wheelset. As to the numerical investigations, a wear prediction model was developed, based on the interfacing of a multi-body simulation code for rail vehicle dynamics, of a local contact analysis model and of a material wear model that assumes a proportionality relationship between wear and frictional power. The validation of this model by comparisons with the measurement performed on the roller rig is still in progress. Some preliminary results are shown in this paper...|$|R
50|$|Just {{as in the}} {{prototype}} railway, on a model the wheel-rail interface is the fundamental aspect of reliable operation.

50|$|Turning is {{significantly}} more difficult with inline speed skates than recreational skates because of more and larger wheels, creating a longer wheelbase. The <b>wheel</b> <b>profile,</b> that is, the cross-section, is parabolic, with a sharper shape than recreational or aggressive wheels, allowing the skater to essentially skate on a smaller, and hence more agile, wheel when leaned {{over in a}} turn.|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that track defects cause {{profound}} effects to the dynamics of railway wagons; normally such problems are examined for cases of wagons running at a constant speed. Brake/traction torques affect the speed profile due to the wheel–rail contact characteristics but most of the wagon–track interaction models do not explicitly consider them in simulation. The authors have recently published a model for the dynamics of wagons subject to braking traction torques on a perfect track by explicitly considering the pitch degree of freedom for wheelsets. The model is extended for cases of lateral and vertical track geometry defects and worn railhead and <b>wheel</b> <b>profiles.</b> This paper presents the results of the analyses carried out using the model extended to the dynamics of wagons containing less ideal <b>wheel</b> <b>profiles</b> running on tracks with geometry defects and worn rails...|$|R
5000|$|Rotary dressers [...] - [...] a rotary dresser (sometimes {{referred}} to as a pizza-cutter dresser) is a disc with a hard material - usually diamond - attached to the edge.

40|$|AbstractIn {{hydro turbine}} {{manufacturing}} and repair, grinding of certain high-curvature surfaces like fillet welds presently cannot {{be carried out}} by robots so hand grinding is necessary. During this process, the grinding wheel is moved {{back and forth over the}} workpiece and thus the <b>wheel</b> maintains its <b>profile</b> and better control of the material removal rate is achieved. To automate such a process, material removal and wheel wear models must be developed and experimentally validated under specific operating conditions. This paper presents the study of predictive models to support automation of grinding <b>wheel</b> <b>profiling...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{trend to}} {{increase}} the weight and length of trains is considerably fast and specially by increasing the cost of energy.Accordingly {{it would be more}} difficult to observe the defects of the cars individually, this was the reason to start developing the first image processing system to check the <b>wheel</b> <b>profile</b> in motion.The first contract was signed in 1998 and the Evaluating Prototype was installed in Rey station near Tehran in 2000.|$|E
50|$|Part {{of their}} {{function}} is to direct the turbulent wakes of the front wing and spinning front wheels away from downstream aerodynamic surfaces. In this capacity, they separate different components of this mixture of flows, and direct them either outside and around the sidepods, or direct flow towards the radiator inlets. As such, the configuration of bargeboards can have significance with respect to cooling. They also help direct flow behind the front wheels, reducing the wake drag created by the <b>wheel</b> <b>profile.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Crush rolls [...] - [...] a crush roll is a {{high-speed}} steel or tungsten carbide wheel. Its profile is the {{mirror image of}} the desired profile of the grinding wheel. It is forced against the grinding wheel, while spinning at the same surface speed as the grinding wheel. Doing so breaks the bond between the abrasive particles {{on the surface of the}} wheel, exposing a new surface as particles fall away. One disadvantage is that the <b>wheel</b> <b>profile</b> cannot be adjusted except by replacing the roll with one having a different profile.|$|E

50|$|After {{the merger}} of the West and East German {{railways}} to create Deutsche Bahn AG, the large fleet of this very robust and reliable East German locomotive was no longer wanted on German rails. An unusual problem arose with a rolling motion that was traced to the <b>wheel</b> <b>profile.</b> On newly laid and ground rails the engine rocked at high speeds. The Deutsche Bahn finally reduced its permitted maximum speed to 80 km/h, which meant it could {{be taken out of}} service because this speed was too low for duties on main lines. Individual locomotives were later equipped with special shock absorbers on their bogies to counter the rocking motion.|$|E
50|$|SimScale's CAE {{software}} finds {{application in}} a wide range of industries — such as HVAC, wind engineering, automotive, aerospace, electronics, industrial equipment and machinery, heat sinks, consumer products, biomechanics etc. Its use cases are very diverse. Japan-based Tokyowheel — a company that engineers technical carbon fiber racing wheels for competitive cyclists — used SimScale's CFD software component to determine the most aerodynamic <b>wheel</b> <b>profile.</b> QRC Technologies performed thermal simulations on SimScale to test multiple variations of their RF tester. Carlsson Autotechnik optimized the aerodynamics of their vehicle with the help SimScale's CFD module.

50|$|Only a {{very small}} number of Mark 1 stock was fitted with the B4 bogie from new, it being used on the Mark 1 only to replace worn BR1 bogies. The British Rail Mark 2 coach, however, carried the B4 bogies from new. A heavier-duty version, the B5, was {{standard}} on Southern Region Mk1-based EMUs from the 1960s onwards. Some Mark 1 catering cars had mixed bogies—a B5 under the kitchen end, and a B4 under the seating end. Some of the B4-fitted Mark 2s, as well as many B4-fitted Mark 1 BGs were allowed to run at 110 mph with extra maintenance, particularly of the <b>wheel</b> <b>profile,</b> and more frequent exams.|$|E
5000|$|Stationary dressers [...] - [...] a {{stationary}} dresser is a metal blade {{with a single}} diamond brazed into the tip.

50|$|In its {{original}} guise, the depot {{was capable of}} handling 8 × 3-car sets in four roads undercover. It had seven stabling roads. Within the depot itself Matterson lifting jacks were used to allow the changing of wheelsets and traction motors. Also a wallcrane {{for the removal of}} pantographs and other associated roof equipment from the fleet. The depot also had an underfloor <b>wheel</b> <b>profiling</b> machine located in a separate shed in No. 7 road.|$|R
50|$|In {{order for}} the tunnel to follow the roadway in the heavily {{built-up}} city centre, the tightest curve in the North-South Tunnel is only 150 m. To operate the trains safely, this required a special profile to be developed for the wheels. The BVG encountered several derailments of its stock, which had only a standard <b>wheel</b> <b>profile.</b> The permissible height in the tunnel is also restricted. Therefore, trains of type DRG BR ET 169, which have a greater height and longer body, can also {{not be used in}} the tunnel. The restrictions in carriage height and length continue to limit the trains that can be used. In particular, trains constructed for other cities cannot be used for the DC S-Bahn system of Berlin.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{particular}} needs of the workforce the G&IER was unique amongst British tramways in operating a service throughout every {{day and night for}} most of its existence. Normally service during the day was every 20 or 30 minutes with less frequent trams overnight and extras at peak times. Because traffic was very heavily peaked, departures at shift-change times often took the form of convoys of up to seven trams. Running time was 27 minutes. At the line’s peak in the 1950s 19 cars were required in service, reduced to ten after 1959. 24 cars were in running order when the line closed. As {{an integral part of the}} railway system, GCR, LNER, and later BR, the tramway featured in the public railway timetables and through tickets were issued from the rest of the system. Amongst others, printed tickets between King’s Cross and Immingham Dock ‘via electric cars’ were available. Local ticketing used the colourful and complex ‘Bell Punch’ system until the end.The railway was not signalled, unlike many other single-track tramways, although local signals were introduced after the Second World War at two level crossings. The track on street sections in Grimsby and at Immingham used conventional grooved tramway rail; the private track sections were originally laid with flat-bottomed rail, replaced later by railway-pattern bullhead rail, and the pointwork required a different <b>wheel</b> <b>profile</b> from that normally used on tramways.|$|E
5000|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the Class 399 units is to operate the {{tram-train}} service between Sheffield and Rotherham. As a consequence, they will be dual voltage vehicles capable of operating on both the 750 V OHLE of Supertram's network, and the 25 kV OHLE that is the standard on the National Rail network. Although the route to Rotherham will be electrified to the 750 V standard used {{on the rest of the}} Supertram network, the installation of dual voltage capability is to allow the vehicles to be [...] "future-proofed" [...] for use as and when the Midland Main Line north of Sheffield is electrified. Additionally, because they will be operating on a heavy rail line, they will be subject to higher crashworthiness standards than the rest of Supertram's fleet, meaning that these units will be the only ones capable of operating the tram-train service to Rotherham. However, they will also be used to strengthen Supertram's existing fleet, which has not been expanded since it was originally commissioned in 1992. The vehicles will be fully integrated into Supertram's fleet, and will be maintained by the manufacturer at the main Nunnery depot. The Rotherham service is envisaged to operate every 20 minutes between Cathedral and , before terminating at a new stop at Rotherham's Parkgate retail park, with a total journey time of approximately 25 minutes. A total of three vehicles will be required for this service level; three of the remainder will be used to increase capacity on the rest of the network, with the seventh in maintenance. Initially however, four of the seven vehicles will be dedicated to the Rotherham service, with the other three used for fleet expansion. This is owing to the different <b>wheel</b> <b>profile</b> required for running on National Rail tracks as opposed to Supertram's own. This is envisaged to be the case until Supertram has completed its full track replacement programme.|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} for simulating wear, rolling contact fatigue, and plastic deformation for a mixed traffic situation in {{switches and crossings}} (S&C) has been developed. The methodology includes simulation of dynamic vehicle—track interaction considering stochastic variations in input data, simulation of wheel—rail contacts accounting for non-linear material properties and plasticity, and simulation of wear and plastic deformation in the rail during {{the life of the}} S&C component. To find means of improving the switch panel design, the geometry of a designed track gauge variation in the switch panel has been represented in a parametric way. For traffic in the facing and trailing moves of the through route, an optimum solution was identified and then validated by evaluating a wide set of simulation cases (using different <b>wheel</b> <b>profiles).</b> The optimum design includes a 12 mm maximum gauge widening. Several crossing geometries were investigated to find an optimal geometric design for the crossing nose and wing rails. The MaKüDe design showed the best performance for moderately worn <b>wheel</b> <b>profiles</b> in both running directions (facing and trailing moves). In connection with reduced support stiffness (e. g. elastic rail pads), this crossing design is predicted to lead to a significant reduction of impact loads and consequently provide a high potential of life-cycle cost reduction...|$|R
30|$|In addition, when {{analyzing}} {{the impact of}} rail and vehicle parameters on <b>wheel</b> <b>profile</b> wear, the above studies completed the <b>wheel</b> <b>profile</b> wear prediction by a single iteration. However, <b>wheel</b> <b>profile</b> deformation caused by wear will change the tendency of these parameters’ influence on the <b>wheel</b> <b>profile</b> wear. Therefore, {{when analyzing}} {{the influence of the}} rail and vehicle parameters on the <b>wheel</b> <b>profile</b> wear, <b>wheel</b> <b>profile</b> should be updated many times in calculation.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} reduce the <b>wheel</b> <b>profile</b> wear of {{high-speed}} trains and extend the service life of wheels, a dynamic model for a high-speed vehicle was set up, in which the wheelset was regarded as flexible body, and the actual measured track irregularities and line conditions were considered. The wear depth of the <b>wheel</b> <b>profile</b> was calculated by the well-known Archard wear law. Through this model, the influence of the <b>wheel</b> <b>profile,</b> primary suspension stiffness, track gage, and rail cant on the wear of <b>wheel</b> <b>profile</b> were studied through multiple iterative calculations. Numerical simulation results show that the type XP 55 <b>wheel</b> <b>profile</b> has the smallest cumulative wear depth, and the type LM <b>wheel</b> <b>profile</b> has the largest wear depth. To reduce the wear of the <b>wheel</b> <b>profile,</b> the equivalent conicity of the wheel should not be too large or too small. On the other hand, a small primary vertical stiffness, a track gage around 1, 435 – 1, 438 mm, and a rail cant around 1 : 35 – 1 : 40 are beneficial for dynamic performance improvement and wheel wear alleviation.|$|E
