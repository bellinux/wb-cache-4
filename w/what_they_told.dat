As a result, his colleagues were especially careful when they recommended people to him.|$|E
500|$|In 1776, Franciscan missionary Silvestre Vélez de Escalante {{was trying}} to find a land route from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to Monterey, California. His party {{included}} twelve Spanish colonials and two Utes from the Utah Valley Timpanogots band who acted as guides. On 23 September 1776, the party entered Utah Valley at the present-day city of Spanish Fork. The local Timanogots villagers hosted them and told them of the lake to the north. [...] In his journal, Escalante described Utah Lake as a [...] "lake, which must be six leagues wide and fifteen leagues long, [...] extends as far as one of these valleys. It runs northwest through a narrow passage, and according to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> us, it communicates with others much larger." [...] The Great Salt Lake was described as the [...] "other lake with which this one communicates, according to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> us, [...] covers many leagues, and its waters are noxious and extremely salty." ...|$|E
500|$|Further {{criticism}} followed. Tod was {{an officer}} of the British imperial system, at that time the world's dominant power. Working in India, he attracted the attention of local rulers who were keen to tell their own tales of defiance against the Mughal empire. He heard <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> him but knew little of what they omitted. He was a soldier writing about a caste renowned for its martial abilities, and he was aided in his writings by the very people whom he was documenting. He had been interested in Rajput history prior to coming into contact with them in an official capacity, as administrator of the region in which they lived. These factors, says Freitag, contribute to why the Annals were [...] "manifestly biased". Freitag argues that critics of Tod's literary output can be split into two groups: those who concentrate on his errors of fact and those who concentrate on his failures of interpretation.|$|E

30|$|Another {{factor that}} can cause {{consumers}} to be deceived when they are led through disclosure documents by irresponsible mortgage brokers or lenders is that consumers often try to reduce their reading load by skimming disclosure forms looking for information that confirms that <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were <b>told</b> was true. <b>They</b> often fail to look for information suggesting that <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were <b>told</b> was false. <b>They</b> do this, even though testing whether <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are <b>told</b> was false would often be a more productive test strategy. Testing whether a statement is true is called a confirmatory test strategy, while testing whether a statement is false is called a disconfirmatory test strategy. Consumers use confirmatory test strategies by default. Disconfirmatory test strategies are difficult for consumers even if {{they know that they}} ought to use them, and many consumers do not even know that they ought to use them.|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} day, Ted Diadiun, {{a sports}} writer and {{columnist for the}} News Herald, Mentor's daily newspaper, wrote about the decision.

2500|$|As such, the {{experimental}} {{subjects of the}} Festinger and Carlsmith study (Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance, 1959) inferred their mental attitudes from their own behaviour. When the subject-participants were asked: [...] "Did you find the task interesting?", the participants decided that they must have found the task interesting, because that is <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> the questioner. Their replies suggested that {{the participants who were}} paid twenty dollars had an external incentive to adopt that positive attitude, and likely perceived the twenty dollars as the reason for saying the task was interesting, rather than saying the task actually was interesting.|$|E

2500|$|Thompson's most {{influential}} work was and remains The Making of the English Working Class, published in 1963 {{while he was}} working at the University of Leeds. The massive book, over 800 pages, was a watershed in the foundation of the field of social history. By exploring the ordinary cultures of working people through their previously ignored documentary remains, Thompson told the forgotten history of the first working-class political left in the world in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. [...] Reflecting on the importance of the book for its 50th anniversary, Emma Griffin explained that Thompson [...] "uncovered details about workshop customs and rituals, failed conspiracies, threatening letters, popular songs, and union club cards. He took what others had regarded as scraps from the archive and interrogated them for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> us about the beliefs and aims of those who were not on the winning side. Here, then, was a book that rambled over aspects of human experience that had never before had their historian.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wealth of}} foreign-minted coins {{could not have}} escaped Trott. He must have known that the ship's crew were not merely {{unlicensed}} slavers, likely noting the patched-up battle damage on the Fancy. When word eventually reached that the Royal Navy and East India Company were hunting for the Fancy and that [...] "Captain Bridgeman" [...] was Every himself, Trott denied ever knowing anything about the pirates' history other than <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> him, adamant that the island's population [...] "saw no reason to disbelieve them." [...] This he argued {{despite the fact that}} the proclamation for the pirates' capture specifically warned that Every's crew could [...] "probably be known and discovered by the great quantities of Gold and Silver of forreign Coines which they have with them." [...] In the meantime, however, Every's men were free to frequent the town's pubs. Nevertheless, the crew soon found themselves disappointed with the Bahamas; the islands were sparsely populated, meaning that there was virtually no place to spend the money they had pirated. For the next several months the pirates spent most of their time living in relative boredom. By now Trott had stripped the Fancy of everything valuable, and it was lost after being violently driven against some rocks, perhaps deliberately on the orders of Trott who was eager to rid himself of a key piece of evidence.|$|E

2500|$|On December 16, 2013, Newsted {{expanded}} upon previous statements {{regarding his}} departure from Metallica and cited that his project with Echobrain was being discouraged by James Hetfield because Metallica's management at Q Prime {{wanted to go}} ahead with promoting Echobrain but was forced to drop it by Hetfield's demands with the quote [...] "other arrangements can be made". Jason was sure that Echobrain would not affect Metallica as it was the pedigree that it already needed. Newsted continues, “And so they had told me, pretty convincingly, ‘This is a great record, we’ve been playing it around the office, that’s all I’ve been hearing, it’s fantastic, this kid has a great voice. Let’s do something with this.’ That’s <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>told</b> me, and then James Hetfield heard about it and was not happy. He was, I think, pretty much out to put the kibosh on the whole thing because it would somehow affect Metallica in his eyes, because now the managers were interested in something I was doing {{that had nothing to do}} with him. ”The bassist sums up the situation as follows: “I have no idea what [...] was thinking, other than just protecting what he valued, just like he does; that's his thing. He protects what he loves, squeezes it too hard, like he said himself. Squeeze it too hard, protecting it too much. That's where I was coming from. The people that I had counted on for 15 years to help me with my career, help Metallica, take care of my money, do all of those things, told me, 'Your new project is fantastic, we'd like to help you with it.' James heard about it, the manager calls me back a couple of days later – 'Sorry we're not going to be able to help you with that Echobrain thing.'” ...|$|E
