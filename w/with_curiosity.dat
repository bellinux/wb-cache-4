5|$|Mariner 9 and Viking allowed better maps of Mars to be {{made using}} the data from these missions, and another major leap forward was the Mars Global Surveyor mission, {{launched}} in 1996 and operated until late 2006, that allowed complete, extremely detailed maps of the Martian topography, magnetic field and surface minerals to be obtained. These maps are available online; for example, at Google Mars. Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Express continued exploring with new instruments, and supporting lander missions. NASA provides two online tools: Mars Trek, which provides visualizations of the planet using data from 50 years of exploration, and Experience Curiosity, which simulates traveling on Mars in 3-D <b>with</b> <b>Curiosity.</b>|$|E
5|$|The visual {{opens with}} a scene of trucks pulling away from a large, brick building. Oh Land is then seen wearing pink {{overalls}} entering the building and sitting down in a folding chair towards the center. As the first verse begins, she stands up and dances around the open space, which continues into the chorus. For the second verse, she is joined by four background dancers, who are now sitting in chairs, much like Oh Land. The singer has changed outfits and is now shown knitting. The next scene has the five women standing spaced apart, before they all begin dancing again. Two female children watch the dancers <b>with</b> <b>curiosity.</b> For the song's refrain, Oh Land rides an all-terrain vehicle, before the video concludes with {{a large group of}} children joining the women for a final dance.|$|E
5|$|Work Kommandos {{were very}} variable, but those in {{agriculture}} were generally considered better than ones in factories or mining, where conditions were worse and prisoners were vulnerable to Allied bombing raids. In {{rural areas of}} Germany, French prisoners replaced locals conscripted into the German army as agricultural labourers. Guarding Kommandos came {{to be regarded as}} an unnecessary waste of manpower - it was thought unlikely that a prisoner would attempt to escape in a country where he did not know the language. This meant that, in practice, prisoners were allowed a wider measure of freedom compared to the camps. They were often viewed <b>with</b> <b>curiosity</b> by the German rural population, and the French prisoners were often allowed to mix quite freely with German civilians. Although unlawful, many French prisoners began relationships with German women.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} deteriorated, and {{in early}} May Hoffmann tried {{in vain to}} find transport to Leipzig. On 8 May, the bridges were destroyed, and his family were marooned in the city. During the day, Hoffmann would roam, watching the fighting <b>with</b> <b>curiosity.</b> Finally, on 20 May, they left for Leipzig, only to be involved in an accident which killed one of the passengers in their coach and injured his wife.|$|E
25|$|The {{minister-president}} of Rhineland-Palatinate (1969-1976) {{was a young}} reformer in {{a somewhat}} backward state, and a newcomer who heavily criticized the older party leaders. The national media, {{for as much as}} they took notice of him, regarded him <b>with</b> <b>curiosity.</b> But this changed when Kohl became chair of the federal party in 1973, and even more dramatically when in late 1975 his party made him candidate for the chancellery. His opponents within the federal party, but also journalists and other observers, had their doubts whether the parochial but successful modernizer of a manageable smaller state was the right person to lead the Federal Republic, a huge and complicated industrial country.|$|E
25|$|The American Prospect {{noted in}} 2008 that Onyango risked being persecuted and {{tortured}} in Kenya if she returned, {{and said that}} risk to her family members had increased, {{whether or not she}} was deported, because of her asylum case having been leaked and widely publicized internationally. They also noted that due to the heightened danger in Kenya, her asylum claim in the US was bolstered. After her case was revealed in international media, Onyango traveled to stay with unidentified friends in Cleveland, Ohio. She had felt threatened in Boston, as people called and knocking on her door at all hours. The Boston police said that there was a problem <b>with</b> <b>curiosity</b> seekers and paparazzi.|$|E

That night, Jack is overcome <b>with</b> <b>curiosity</b> and ventures out of the closet while Old Nick is asleep in bed with his mother. Joy is horrified when she awakens and sees their interaction, slapping Old Nick away. As punishment, he cuts their heat and power. Joy decides to tell Jack about the outside world; he reacts with disbelief and incomprehension, but also curiosity. She has Jack fake a fever, hoping that Old Nick will take him to a hospital where he can alert the authorities, but Old Nick says he will return the following day with antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|A {{long time}} ago some young lads herded sheep on Hesselberg. At that {{time there was a}} deep cave on the mountain, which is buried today. Bursting <b>with</b> <b>curiosity</b> they wanted to know what was inside. One of them was lowered by rope down into the deep hole. Beforehand the boys had decided to pull him up {{immediately}} when he gave a tug on the rope. Soon after the boy went into the cave, a three-legged rabbit hobbled across the way, the other lads followed it spontaneously in order to catch it, but the farther they chased the faster the rabbit ran. Finally they gave up. When they returned to the cave they remembered their fellow in the hole and they immediately pulled the rope up. It was stained with blood and at its end there hung a goat's hoof, but the boy was gone forever.|$|E
25|$|The crew {{wait out}} the storm so they can restore {{communications}} and be rescued. As the crew struggles against the cold, they find an NTI has formed an animated column of water and is exploring the base. Though they treat it <b>with</b> <b>curiosity,</b> Coffey is agitated by it and cuts it in half by closing a pressure bulkhead on it, causing it to retreat. The crew soon realize that Coffey is suffering paranoia from high-pressure nervous syndrome. Spying on him through a remote operated vehicle, they find he and another SEAL are arming the warhead to attack the NTIs, and race to stop him. Bud fights Coffey but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead, and Bud and Lindsey give chase in the other sub. Coffey is able to launch the warhead into the trench, but his sub is damaged and drifts {{over the edge of}} the trough, and he is crushed when the sub implodes from high pressures. The other mini-sub is also damaged and is taking on water; with only one functional diving suit, Lindsey opts to enter deep hypothermia when the ocean's cold water engulfs her, and Bud swims back with her body to the platform. There, he and the crew administer CPR and revive her, and Bud and Lindsey reaffirm their lost love.|$|E

500|$|The {{release of}} Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (released as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States) {{took place in}} 2001. Radcliffe {{received}} a seven figure salary for the lead role, but asserted that the fee was [...] "not that important" [...] to him; his parents chose to invest the money for him. The film was highly popular and was met with positive reviews, and critics took notice of Radcliffe: [...] "Radcliffe is the embodiment of every reader's imagination. It is wonderful to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled <b>with</b> <b>curiosity</b> and who connects with very real emotions, from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing," [...] wrote Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle.|$|E
500|$|The new Louvre {{courtyard}} {{was opened}} to the public on 14 October 1988, and the Pyramid entrance was opened the following March. By this time, public opinion had softened on the new installation; a poll found a fifty-six percent approval rating for the pyramid, with twenty-three percent still opposed. The newspaper Le Figaro had vehemently criticized Pei's design, but later celebrated the tenth anniversary of its magazine supplement at the pyramid. Prince Charles of Britain surveyed the new site <b>with</b> <b>curiosity,</b> and declared it [...] "marvelous, very exciting". A writer in Le Quotidien de Paris wrote: [...] "The much-feared pyramid has become adorable." [...] The experience was exhausting for Pei, but also rewarding. [...] "After the Louvre," [...] he said later, [...] "I thought no project would be too difficult." [...] The Louvre Pyramid has become Pei's most famous structure.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film a perfect four star rating, {{believing that the}} film [...] "leaves you breathless <b>with</b> <b>curiosity,</b> as it teases itself with the {{directions}} it might take. To watch the film is {{to be actively involved}} in the challenge of its creation." [...] He later added the film to his [...] "Great Movies" [...] collection. At the end of 2009, Ebert named the film one of the best of the decade. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film a four star rating, and praised Kaufman's writing, stating [...] "Screenwriting this smart, inventive, passionate and rip-roaringly funny is a rare species. So all praise to Charlie Kaufman, working with director Spike Jonze to create the most original and outrageous film comedy since the two first teamed on Being John Malkovich, in 1999." [...] Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "This is epic, funny, tragic, demanding, strange, original, boldly sincere filmmaking. And the climax, the portion that either sinks the entire movie or self-critically explains how so many others derail, is bananas." [...] David Ansen of Newsweek felt Meryl Streep had not [...] "been this much fun to watch in years", while Mike Clark of USA Today gave a largely negative review, mainly criticizing the ending: [...] "Too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like, this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot." ...|$|E
500|$|The next match pitted Bam Bam Bigelow, Bastion Booger and The Headshrinkers (accompanied by Luna Vachon and Afa) {{against a}} team calling {{themselves}} the Four Doinks. After Bigelow's team was introduced, Doink the Clown's theme song began to play, but immediately {{switched to the}} theme of The Bushwhackers and Howard Finkel introduced the pair as Luke Doink and Butch Doink as they came down wearing clown wigs, with Luke riding a scooter and Butch pulling a wagon. As the fans waited to see who would be the other two Doinks, the intro to Doink's theme played again and the two Doinks were joined by Mabel Doink and Mo Doink with their rapping manager Oscar Doink; as they came to the ring they were referred to by Bobby Heenan as [...] "Doinks on a Mission". Headshrinker Samu was eliminated first after he bit several of the balloons being carried by his opponents. He was purposely offered one more balloon by the Doinks, which he willfully bit into. Samu was stunned to find out that the balloon was full of water, which caused him to stumble back in surprise and Luke rolled him up and pinned him. Later, Booger has a chance to pin Luke after he hit the Trip to the Batcave on him. However, Booger got off of Luke and went to the corner where Headshrinker Fatu offered him a banana. As Booger was looking to perform the move again, his teammates dragged him away and Booger landed on his knees. Luke and Butch performed their trademark battering ram on Booger. Mabel then executed a leg drop on Booger and pinned him. Down four wrestlers to two, Bigelow's team appeared to be making a comeback when Fatu began taking down his opponents with the carcass of a turkey that Afa had been eating from the entire match. He then performed a top rope splash onto Mo. Fatu got distracted, however, and examined a banana peel <b>with</b> <b>curiosity.</b> Butch entered the ring with a bucket and faked out Fatu by making {{like he was going to}} toss the contents of the bucket onto him. This resulted in Fatu slipping on the banana peel, and Butch pinned him to eliminate him from the match. Left by himself, Bigelow began brutally atracking three of the Doinks and seemed to get the upper hand when Mabel entered the ring and Bigelow was unable to do much to him. Meanwhile, Butch dumped a bucket of confetti all over Luna, which caused Bigelow to become momentarily distracted and Mabel and Mo sandwiched him in the corner. Bigelow fell, Mabel performed a splash on him, and the referee counted the pin as the other three Doinks piled on. After the match, the real Doink the Clown appeared on the video screen to taunt Bigelow.|$|E

2500|$|The {{historian}} Richard Carrier, in {{his book}} Sense and Goodness without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism, describes metaphysical naturalism thus: as a philosophy [...] "wherein worship is replaced <b>with</b> <b>curiosity,</b> devotion with diligence, holiness with sincerity, ritual with study, and scripture with the whole world and the whole of human learning". Carrier wrote {{that it is the}} naturalist’s duty [...] "to question all things and have a well-grounded faith in what is well-investigated and well-proved, rather than what is merely well-asserted or well-liked".|$|E
