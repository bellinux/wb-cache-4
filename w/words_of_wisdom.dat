5|$|The {{order of}} service {{is similar to}} other Pentecostal churches, for example the Assemblies of God. There is no formal order of service, but most churches follow a routine of congregational singing, an offering/tithe collection, prayer, a sermon and an altar call. During the service, congregants may operate in various spiritual gifts, such as a message in tongues, a prophecy and <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>wisdom</b> or knowledge, as {{inspired}} by the Holy Spirit. During the congregational singing part of a service, a believer’s attitude of worship is often expressed through raising their hands in the orans posture.|$|E

50|$|In 1833, Smith {{received}} the revelation {{known as the}} <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisdom,</b> part <b>of</b> which prohibits the consumption of alcohol, {{with the exception of}} sacramental wine. Initially, the <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisdom</b> was treated as a recommendation, and the early Latter Day Saints would still drink alcohol on occasion. During the late-19th century, church leaders began to interpret the <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisdom</b> as a mandatory requirement for members. This increased respect for the <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisdom,</b> combined with other scriptures in Doctrine and Covenants led congregations to begin substituting water for the sacramental wine. The practice was officially adopted church-wide in 1912.|$|R

2500|$|Today, {{adherence}} to the proscriptions <b>of</b> the <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisdom</b> is required for baptism and for entry into temples of the LDS Church. BYU historian Thomas G.

2500|$|Despite these statements, restricting meat {{consumption}} was {{not made}} an explicit requirement for worthiness in the LDS Church as the standards for obedience to the <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisdom</b> were made increasingly central to LDS Church doctrine and practice in the early 20th century. The increased emphasis on the <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisdom</b> {{took place during the}} presidency of Heber J. Grant, a long-time enthusiastic promoter <b>of</b> the <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisdom.</b> Although Grant did not make restricting meat consumption an explicit part of the standard, he continued to interpret it as part of the counsel in the <b>Word</b> <b>of</b> <b>Wisdom.</b> In the 1937 General Conference, at 80 years old, Grant said he worked long hours [...] "without fatigue and without feeling the least injury".

25|$|In various respects, {{the history}} of Mirza Ali Mohammed, surnamed the Báb, {{presents}} startling resemblance {{to that of the}} Savior.
