5000|$|In some Jewish legends, Adam {{was created}} from {{dust from the}} four corners of the Earth, and, <b>when</b> <b>bent</b> down, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> was the East and his feet the West. In another legend, he {{contained}} the soul of everybody who would ever be born. In the teachings of Kabbalah, such a primordial man is referred to as Adam Kadmon. In Indian mythology, Purusha is a similar figure, who is considered the part of the individual which is immortal.|$|R
60|$|Helen drew back, now {{thoroughly}} {{alarmed by}} the man's fierce energy. She had been warned against this very boldness in frontiersmen; but had felt secure in her own pride and dignity. Her blood boiled {{at the thought that}} she must exert strength to escape insult. She struggled violently <b>when</b> Brandt <b>bent</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Almost sick with fear, she had determined to call for help, when a violent wrench almost toppled her over. At the same instant her wrists were freed; she heard a fierce cry, a resounding blow, and then the sodden thud of a heavy body falling. Recovering her balance, she saw a tall figure beside her, and a man in the act of rising from the ground.|$|R

You ARE pretty! Some day in Boston I'll show you how we buy a lunch. Well, hang it, got to be starting back." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> {{the fellow}} <b>bent</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> over <b>his</b> work Marston glanced {{carefully}} about the engine-room. He saw the condenser; the cover was on, which {{indicated that the}} repairs were finished. A chain tackle hung from the beams above the cylinders and some nuts lay about their heads. The pistons had obviously been lifted {{in order to put}} on new rings. Other things Marston noted implied that the engines had been given a thorough overhaul. He thought the work was nearly completed, but when one examined a vessel's engines the boiler was generally opened and he crept cautiously to the stokehold.|$|R
