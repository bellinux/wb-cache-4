25|$|The {{proportion}} of females {{as a predictor}} of c was largely mediated by social sensitivity (Sobel z = 1.93, P= 0.03) which is in vein <b>with</b> <b>previous</b> <b>research</b> showing that women score higher on social sensitivity tests. While a mediation, statistically speaking, clarifies the mechanism underlying the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable, Wolley agreed {{in an interview with the}} Harvard Business Review that these findings are saying that groups of women are smarter than groups of men. However, she relativizes this stating that the actual important thing is the high social sensitivity of group members.|$|E
25|$|Evidence from {{a series}} of four {{experiments}} conducted by Gomez and Gerken suggests that children are able to generalize grammatical structures with less than two minutes of exposure to an artificial grammar. In the first experiment, 11-12 month-old infants were trained on an artificial grammar composed of nonsense words with a set grammatical structure. At test, infants heard both novel grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. Infants oriented longer towards the grammatical sentences, in line <b>with</b> <b>previous</b> <b>research</b> that suggests that infants generally orient for a longer amount of time to natural instances of language rather than altered instances of language e.g.,. (This familiarity preference differs from the novelty preference generally found in word-learning studies, due to the differences between lexical acquisition and syntactical acquisition.) This finding indicates that young children are sensitive to the grammatical structure of language even after minimal exposure. Gomez and Gerken also found that this sensitivity is evident when ungrammatical transitions are located {{in the middle of the}} sentence (unlike in the first experiment, in which all the errors occurred at the beginning and end of the sentences), that the results could not be due to an innate preference for the grammatical sentences caused by something other than grammar, and that children are able to generalize the grammatical rules to new vocabulary.|$|E

2500|$|Testing the {{hypothesis}} that procrastinators have less of {{a focus on the}} future due to a greater focus on more immediate concerns, college undergraduates completed several self-report questionnaires, which did indeed find that procrastinators focus less on the future. Researchers had also expected to find that procrastination would be associated with a hedonistic and [...] "devil-may-care" [...] perspective on the present; against their expectations, they found that procrastination was better predicted by a fatalistic and hopeless attitude towards life. This finding fits well <b>with</b> <b>previous</b> <b>research</b> relating procrastination and depression.|$|E
2500|$|Although the CMAS {{proved to}} not have a {{feminine}} bias, Quarter and Laxer found that females tend to score higher on the TMAS than their male counterparts. An example of these questions endorsed more frequently by females is, “I cry easily”. Similarly, Goodstein and Goldberger found that 17 of the 38 questions {{were more likely to}} be endorsed by females than males. [...] Gall found that when she tested the femininity versus masculinity qualities of men and women, then compared them to the TMAS score, the people that were more feminine, either male or female, were more likely to have a positive correlation with their anxiety level score. Based on this, Gall agreed <b>with</b> <b>previous</b> <b>research</b> that stated the TMAS is more strongly female based. Hafner, however, found that the CMAS does not reflect the gender difference as the girls that took the children’s test only scored higher than the boys consistently on two of the questions.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} experiment, the social sharing tended to decline as time passed, but the intense emotion {{condition}} elicited significantly more sharing {{during the first}} two minutes that the subjects were together. The findings again suggest that intensity of the emotion and the extent of sharing are not linked monotonically. In both studies, about 90% of the verbal exchanges were comments by targets. Targets’ expressions predominantly consisted of [...] "giving information" [...] and [...] "expressing feelings" [...] about the movie, thereby conforming to the formal definition of the social sharing of emotion. On the other hand, the partners’ comments were found to be brief and to consist mainly of requests for further information and expressions of feelings elicited by the targets’ sharing. In this regard, the findings are quite consistent <b>with</b> <b>previous</b> <b>research</b> showing that the sharing of an emotion elicits emotional responses for the listeners. According to Luminet et al. these results suggest that social sharing fulfills informational goals as well as emotional ones.|$|E

40|$|Evolutionary {{computation}} for {{image processing}} is an encouraging research area. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images when used to characterize metallic and non-metallic nano-particles (size, morphology, structure, or composition), need such advanced image processing algorithms. This paper presents an efficient evolutionary computational method, {{particle swarm optimization}} (PSO), for automatic segmentation of nano-particles. A threshold-based segmentation technique is applied, where image entropy is attacked as a minimization problem to specify local and global thresholds. We are concerned with reducing wrong characterization of nano-particles due to concentration of liquid solutions or supporting material within the acquired image. The obtained results are compared with manual techniques and <b>with</b> <b>previous</b> <b>researches</b> in this area...|$|R
