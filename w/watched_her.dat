5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1876, Yangwu visited the Australian colonies, {{and later in the}} year the Chinese ambassadors to Great Britain, Kwoh Song Tao and Liu-Si-hung, visited Yangwu via mail steamer in December while she was in Singapore. Following the visit, she sailed to Manila. When she arrived in February 1877, an {{accident}} occurred as the crew were preparing a gun salute for her entrance to the harbour. As the crewman loaded the charge into one of the guns, it detonated, throwing him from the ship and killing him. The crewman was subsequently buried in the city. Yangwu proved to be a spectacle for the inhabitants of the city, particularly the Chinese, some of whom had sailed out to greet her arrival in small boats and others who <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> from the mound on which the lighthouse sat overlooking the bay.|$|E

Koestler-Grack reports that, on March 19, 1884, she {{was being}} watched by Chief Sitting Bull when:Oakley playfully skipped on stage, lifted her rifle, and aimed the barrel at a burning candle. In one shot, she snuffed out the flame with a {{whizzing}} bullet. Sitting Bull <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> knock corks off of bottles and slice through a cigar Butler held in his teeth.|$|E

25|$|Kaia Kanepi {{was born}} in Haapsalu. Her father, Jaak (a real estate broker) and mother Anne (a homemaker) played tennis. They also have daughters Kadri, who won a tennis {{scholarship}} to study in the United States, and Karin, a dedicated horse rider.

25|$|Ruth Handler <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> {{daughter}} Barbara {{play with}} paper dolls, {{and noticed that}} she often enjoyed giving them adult roles. At the time, most children's toy dolls were representations of infants. Realizing {{that there could be}} a gap in the market, Handler suggested the idea of an adult-bodied doll to her husband Elliot, a co-founder of the Mattel toy company. He was unenthusiastic about the idea, as were Mattel's directors.|$|E

Hilde reveals that she {{had always wanted to}} be a nurse, however her dreams of a nursing career were shattered the day her village was bombed during air raids. She had <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> brother Stephen die as she was swallowed by mounds of earth. The raid had made her weak and incapable of dealing with trauma later in her life.|$|E
25|$|As {{the largest}} {{ship in the}} world, and {{the first in a}} new class of superliners, Olympics maiden voyage {{attracted}} considerable worldwide attention from the press and public. Following her arrival in New York, Olympic was opened up to the public and received over 8,000 visitors. More than 10,000 spectators <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> depart from New York harbour, for her first return trip. During her third crossing, an observer of the Cunard Line was on board, in search of ideas for a new ship for the company (the Aquitania) by inspecting various installations on board.|$|E
25|$|The {{passengers}} {{were put into}} the seven ship's boats:The steamer had struck nearly in the centre; her fore part was sunk very deep, and we <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> with the greatest anxiety {{to see if the}} water gained on her, fearing for the safety of those still on board, and also dreading that if she sank our boats would all be swamped. We rowed backwards and forwards between the rocks and the steamer all night, and a weary time it was. Guns were fired, and rockets sent up; but our signals of distress were not answered, though a light we saw at some distance on the shore made us hopeful that assistance was at hand. The masts were cut down to lighten the ship, and the crash as they fell into the water sounded very fearful.|$|E

25|$|The {{first attempt}} to legalise {{euthanasia}} {{took place in the}} United States, when Henry Hunt introduced legislation into the General Assembly of Ohio in 1906. Hunt did so at the behest of Anna Hall, a wealthy heiress who was a major figure in the euthanasia movement during the early 20th century in the United States. Hall had <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> mother die after an extended battle with liver cancer, and had dedicated herself to ensuring that others would not have to endure the same suffering. Towards this end she engaged in an extensive letter writing campaign, recruited Lurana Sheldon and Maud Ballington Booth, and organised a debate on euthanasia {{at the annual meeting of}} the American Humane Association in 1905 – described by Jacob Appel as the first significant public debate on the topic in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E
25|$|Born in the East End at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Lou lived in Walford all her life. She {{was born into a}} large working-class East End family, the youngest of seven siblings, and grew up with a strong sense of community spirit. In the 1930s, {{she fell in love with}} a local boy, Albert Beale (Gary Olson), and gave birth to his daughter, Maggie (Olivia Stanley), but had her adopted because she was born out of wedlock. By 1936, Lou and Albert had married and in 1938 moved to 45 Albert Square. They had six more children: Harry (Aaron Mason), Ronnie (Chase Marks), Dora, Kenny (Michael Attwell), and twins Pete (Peter Dean) and Pauline (Wendy Richard). Albert died in 1965, and Lou remained in the same house with Pauline and her husband, Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher). Lou regularly intervened in her family's affairs, especially when she disapproved of Pete's relationship with Kathy Hills (Gillian Taylforth) because he had previously divorced his first wife, Pat (Pam St Clement), and she had banished her son Kenny to New Zealand in the 1960s for having an affair with Pat. Lou then <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> grandchildren Michelle (Susan Tully), Mark (David Scarboro/Todd Carty) and Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) grow up, with Pauline, Pete, Arthur and Kathy looking after her in her old age. In one episode she claims she was one of seven children, one boy and six girls, and on Christmas Day 1987, she states she is from a family of eight, five boys and three girls.|$|E

500|$|Windsor {{has been}} {{described}} as the biggest [...] "name" [...] that EastEnders has ever added to its cast, and her arrival came at a time in the show's history that has been branded its [...] "worst creative period". Mark Lawson for The Independent wrote that Windsor's casting was intended to combat low ratings, commenting: [...] "The Windsor initiative seems to be a direct response to suggestions that EastEnders has become too gloomy: a view heavily advanced by Roy Hattersley, former deputy leader of the Labour Party, and fan of the BBC series' rival on ITV, Coronation Street. Certainly, Miss Windsor has been associated throughout her career with the lighter touch." [...] According to Windsor, 27 million viewers <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> first appearance as Peggy on-screen. Mark Lawson for The Daily Telegraph has stated that five million extra viewers <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> first scenes, reporting that initially: [...] "The critics said that she lacked the 'brassiness and vulnerability' for soap acting and that, stripped of her bubbly image, 'nothing much of interest was revealed'. Ironically, viewers complained that she was too upmarket." [...] Windsor has commented of the impact of her pre-existing celebrity status: ...|$|E

She helped to sink the German armoured cruiser [...] during the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915 and towed the damaged British battlecruiser [...] to safety after the battle. She damaged the German battlecruisers [...] and [...] during the Battle of Jutland in mid-1916 and <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> sister ship [...] explode. Deemed obsolete after the war, she was sold for scrap in 1921.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{had been}} {{suggested}} that Pauline's presence in EastEnders was largely peripheral for some time, the news of her departure in 2006 was met with dismay by fans and soap journalists alike. In a report for BBC News, one viewer commented [...] "it's so sad, because I've <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> for 20 years. She's such a large character", and another said [...] "If she goes then I think EastEnders is finished." [...] BBC controller of continuing drama, John Yorke, commented Richard [...] "occupies a huge place in people's hearts", and executive producer Kate Harwood said, [...] "For many years Wendy simply was EastEnders for the audience and Pauline's indomitable nature typified the grit and fight that embodies the EastEnders spirit... We thank her for everything she has done for the show." ...|$|E

Many viewers and commentators felt that Evancho should have won, and Grimm expressed surprise at the outcome. The show brought Evancho wide exposure to American audiences, as up to 16 million viewers <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> performances. The finale show was AGTs highest-rated episode in three years. She was a guest on The Tonight Show {{a week after the}} finale, where she sang and gave her first late-night interview with Jay Leno. Evancho was featured and interviewed in the 2013 book Inside AGT: The Untold Stories of America's Got Talent.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{accompanied}} {{the family to}} Austin and spent several months caring for Hogg and her brothers. Davis, who had lost her husband to tuberculosis and <b>watched</b> <b>her</b> son fight the disease, believed that Hogg must have contracted the disease from her mother. Davis instructed Ima to never marry {{so as not to}} pass on the illness. By the end of 1895, the children had been enrolled in a boarding school in San Marcos. The following year, they returned to Austin to live with their father. Although the family employed a housekeeper, Hogg was considered the lady of the house and supervised the housecleaning as well as the education of her younger brothers. In 1898, Hogg accompanied her father to Hawaii, where they met Hawaiian Queen Liliuokalani and watched the ceremony that delivered Hawaii to the United States. The two were scheduled to sail to Seattle, but Hogg refused to board the ship. Sobbing, she begged her father to make other arrangements because she [...] "had an awful feeling". He relented and they instead sailed to California, where they learned that their original ship had been lost at sea with no survivors.|$|E

Leigh travelled to Los Angeles, however, to be with Olivier and to try to convince David Selznick that she was the person for the part. Myron Selznick also represented Olivier and when he met Leigh, he felt that she possessed the qualities that his brother was searching for. According to legend, Myron Selznick took Leigh and Olivier to the set where the burning of the Atlanta Depot scene was being filmed and stage-managed an encounter, where he introduced Leigh, derisively addressing his younger brother, [...] "Hey, genius, meet your Scarlett O'Hara." [...] The following day, Leigh read a scene for Selznick, who organized a screen test with director George Cukor and wrote to his wife, [...] "She's the Scarlett dark horse and looks damn good. Not for anyone's ear but your own: it's narrowed down to Paulette Goddard, Jean Arthur, Joan Bennett and Vivien Leigh". The director, George Cukor, concurred and praised Leigh's [...] "incredible wildness". She secured the role of Scarlett soon after.|$|E
