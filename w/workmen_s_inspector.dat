The Hope Report details the numerous failings of the system which led to the Ward tragedy. Both GSL and the Western Australian state government had breached a duty of care to Mr Ward. Further, it remains highly problematical having a range of oversight bodies if elected government is able to simply ignore the subsequent advice.

Strain F 199 contained 2 -OH 14 : 0 and 18 : 1 � 7 c as the predominant cellular fatty acids and sphingolipids that are characteristic of the genus Sphingomonas. Phylogenetic analysis of its 16 S rRNA sequence indicated that F 199 was most closely related to Sphingomonas capsulata among the bacteria currently in the Ribosomal Database. Five additional isolates from deep Southeast Coastal Plain sediments were determined by 16 S rRNA sequence analysis to be closely related to F 199. These strains also contained characteristic sphingolipids. Four of these five strains could also grow on {{a broad range of}} aromatic compounds and could mineralize [14 C]toluene and [14 C]naphthalene. S. capsulata (ATCC 14666), Sphingomonas paucimobilis (ATCC 29837), and one of the subsurface isolates were unable to grow on any of the aromatic compounds or mineralize toluene or naphthalene.

Over 25, 000 structures stand within the city 2 ̆ 7 s borders that are either individually landmarked or contributing buildings within a historic district. These buildings are covered by statutory protection designed to prevent alteration or demolition without consultation with the Office of Historic Preservation (HPO) and/or the D. C.

Enforcement of these protections relies on HPO 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>inspectors.</b> While the District currently employs two historic preservation inspectors, recent changes in the structure of HPO and other D.

In the last several years the number of enforcement actions carried out by HPO has declined precipitously, reflecting inefficiencies symptomatic of the new arrangement. Without significant changes to the current mode of operation, HPO inspectors will be forced to continue enforcement triage while allowing the majority of infractions to escape without consequence. This in turn has a detrimental impact on the number of fines assessed by HPO inspectors, thereby reducing the amount of funds available for historic preservation projects. This is a policy paper, and as such, will lay out in detail the current structure and practices of the historic preservation regime in Washington D.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the Richardson Methods, {{especially}} regarding to its practical issues by reconsidering the criticism from the then His Majesty 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Inspector</b> George Herbert Hooper. The Richardson Methods were developed by Marion Richardson (1892 - 1946), who pioneered learner centered art education based on the pupils 2 ̆ 7 innerimagery. Hooper wrote to Richardson after the observation of her class, and his criticism in the letter has been a basis of the view that the methods were strongly tied up with Richardson,s personal character so that it is not understandable or transferable to others. I tried to reexamine this view by referring to Richardson 2 ̆ 7 s syllabus, lecture notes, her pupils, works etc. The topics including the relation between teacher 2 ̆ 7 s leadership and learner centered education, the two principles of Richardson 2 ̆ 7 s reaching, the problem of the "resemblance" of works in the class, Richardson 2 ̆ 7 s view on the Cizek School 2 ̆ 7 s exhibition, and the political purpose and bias of the Inspector 2 ̆ 7 s letter were discussed in the paper. In conclusion, it was pointed out that the Inspector 2 ̆ 7 s criticism to the leaners 2 ̆ 7 spontaneous expression, to the continuation of it after adolescence, and to the transference of the methods to the others were not necessarily based on a full understanding of her teaching. And we can have a possibility to open up a way to the further development of the methods in our education...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold. Firstly it is to examine the {{response}} to school inspection conducted by teacher 2 ̆ 7 s organisations, especially by the National Union of Teachers (NUT), thereby receiving to its rsearch reports. Secondly it aims to give consideration to the role of such an organisationunder the school evaluation system, hereby including school-self evaluation and school inspection. In 1992 a new school inspection system by the Office for Standard in Education (OFSTED) was introduced to England. Before this system, the school inspection had been conducted by Her Majesty 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Inspector</b> (HMI). Teacher 2 ̆ 7 s crganisations had evaluated this system as helpful and important for developing teachers 2 ̆ 7 professional motivation. The response to OFSTED school inspection by NUT, however, is very negative. It seems that schools and teachers are being divided into 2 ̆ 7 good 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 failed 2 ̆ 7 by the OFSTED inspection, especially by the classroom observation under the OFSTED 2 ̆ 7 s limited framework, which has had a big impact. Not only the teachers labeled as 2 ̆ 7 failed 2 ̆ 7 are gradually losing their self confidence and professional motivation. NUT emphasises school self-evaluation as a strategy against OFSTED 2 ̆ 7 s dominant school inspection in order to consider differences betweene schools and to encourage teacher 2 ̆ 7 s professional motivation. It 2 ̆ 7 s framework respects school own specific circumstances and its indicators are generated and developed by people directly involved, such as pupils, students, teachers, parents, and govenors. But OFSTED has introduced its framework of self-school inspection m 1999 and is trying to make schools use this self-school inspection criteria as their school self-evaluationcriteria. This will make it impossible for schools to use their own self-evaluation criteria and gives OFSTED 2 ̆ 7 s inspection system more and more authority. The role of teacher 2 ̆ 7 s organisatoins is to continue the empirical research for school self-evaluation to ensure its effect for school improvement and to support teachers who are facing problems in their job. Moreover, it is to continue developing and examining a school self-evaluation framework which is useful to examine OFSTED inspection objectively...|$|R

40|$|Stinking smut or bunt {{of wheat}} is an ever-present and {{destructive}} {{disease in the}} wheat fields of Utah. During the past season (1925) this disease was especially prevalent, causing losses in certain fields of from 25 to 50 per cent, not counting the loss to the grower in reduced grade of grain.

The average reduction for smut is near ten cents a bushel with a variation from five to twenty cents. The cost of producing a smutted crop may equal or even exceed the cost of producing a clean crop. Loss occurring from this disease, since it is preventable, can hardly be considered attached to the total gross returns; it is a subtraction from the net profit.

40|$|Purpose: Refractive error {{has been}} shown to {{fluctuate}} in poorly controlled diabetic patients. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure acute diurnal fluctuations in refractive error and blood glucose levels (BGLs) in diabetic and control subjects. Methods: Twenty-one type 2 diabetic subjects (age 56 ± 11 years), 20 type 1 diabetic subjects (age 38 ± 15 years) and 20 non-diabetic controls (age 49 ± 23 years) took part in the study. Refractive error was measured with an OPD ARK- 10000 autorefractometer (Nidek) and BGLs were measured using a finger stick test (Hemocue). All measurements were taken six times during the day, between 8 AM and 8 PM at approximately twohourly intervals. Using power vector analysis the variability in refractive error was mapped against time of day and related to BGLs, HbA 1 c, diabetic status and duration of disease. Results: Refractive error was similar between groups (p= 0. 96) and did not fluctuate significantly during the day in any of the three groups (ANOVA p> 0. 05). The mean ± SD values for BGLs during the day were 10. 4 ± 4. 40 mM/l in DM type 2, 10. 3 ± 5. 30 mM/l in DM type 1, and 5. 4 ± 1. 04 mM/l in control subjects. BGLs changed significantly during the day and between groups (ANOVA p 0. 05). Multiple regression analysis showed that neither BGLs, HbA 1 c, diabetic status, nor duration of disease had a significant effect on diurnal refractive error measurements. (p> 0. 05). Conclusions: Diurnal changes in BGLs do not result in significant acute refractive error fluctuations in diabetic patients, as measured with an autorefractometer. CR: C.
