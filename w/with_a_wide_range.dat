They include species <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> of colours and forms that build and enhance reef systems.

5|$|Calcium is an {{essential}} element needed in large quantities. The Ca2+ ion acts as an electrolyte and {{is vital to the}} health of the muscular, circulatory, and digestive systems; is indispensable to the building of bone; and supports synthesis and function of blood cells. For example, it regulates the contraction of muscles, nerve conduction, and the clotting of blood. As a result, intra- and extracellular calcium levels are tightly regulated by the body. Calcium can play this role because the Ca2+ ion forms stable coordination complexes with many organic compounds, especially proteins; it also forms compounds <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> of solubilities, enabling the formation of skeletons.|$|E

5|$|The {{series is}} notable for {{borrowing}} extensively from East Asian art and mythology for its universe, and employed cultural consultants Edwin Zane and calligrapher Siu-Leung Lee {{to help determine}} its art direction and settings. Its character designs are influenced by Chinese art and history, Hinduism, Taoism and Buddhism, and Yoga. The series' music and sound were composed by Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn, who experimented <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> of different instruments, including the guzheng, pipa, and duduk, to create music and sounds that matched the Asiatic-influenced setting of the show. The art style of the various fictitious locations visited throughout the series are based on real locations in Asia. Notably, sites such as the Forbidden City and the Great Wall of China in Beijing were inspirations for the Earth Kingdom city of Ba Sing Se in the show.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens begin {{breeding}} {{once they}} are three years old. Breeding season is from July to September, with no substantial difference in timing across its range around the country despite it inhabiting a range of diverse climates and habitats across 19 degrees of latitude. Rowley has pointed out this is unusual for a bird species <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wide</b> <b>range</b> and has postulated that breeding is initiated by day length. Rarely, breeding can take place in May, June or October. Australian ravens generally nest in tall trees, never near {{to the ground as}} some species do. The nest also functions as a lookout post and so tall or emergent trees are selected. The ravens occasionally nest on buildings, telegraph poles, or tall windmills which allow the species to occupy areas lacking in tall trees. Windmills may have assisted the spread of the species in North Queensland and the Northern Territory. The highest recorded corvid nest in Australia was found atop the AWA Tower in Sydney.|$|E
