5|$|Early in production, Warner Bros. {{decided to}} release Phantasm as a {{theatrical}} release, rather than straight to video. That left {{less than a}} year for production time (most animated features take well over two years from finished story to final release). Due to this decision, the animators <b>went</b> <b>over</b> the scenes in order to accommodate the widescreen theatrical aspect ratio. The studio cooperated well, granting the filmmakers a large amount of creative control.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the first}} half, by much rushing, forcing, snapbacks and {{vigorous}} bullyragging Riggs, the huge Hopkins quarterback, crashed over the goal line for 4 points. Paul Dashiell converted. Riggs repeated his performance but Dashiell missed conversion. Navy then adopted the Hopkins rushing tactics and Stone <b>went</b> <b>over</b> for the first score.|$|E
5|$|In Cyprus, all the kingdoms had revolted {{except that}} of Amathus. The {{leader of the}} Cypriot revolt was Onesilus, brother of the king of Salamis, Gorgus. Gorgus {{did not want to}} revolt, so Onesilus locked his brother out of the city and made himself king. Gorgus <b>went</b> <b>over</b> to the Persians, and Onesilus persuaded the other Cypriots, apart from the Amathusians, to revolt. He then settled down to besiege Amathus.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Moses told the Israelites {{that he was}} 120 years old that day, could no longer go out and come in, and God {{had told him that}} he was not to <b>go</b> <b>over</b> the Jordan River. God would <b>go</b> <b>over</b> before them and destroy the nations ahead of them, and Joshua would <b>go</b> <b>over</b> before them, as well. The first reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|R
5|$|In the San Diego East-West Christmas Classic, Centre {{defeated}} Arizona 38–0 as {{rain fell}} throughout the game. Red Roberts scored the first touchdown five {{minutes into the}} match. Bo McMillin <b>went</b> <b>over</b> the right tackle for another score. Centre led 18–0 at the half as Arizona was held to no first downs in two quarters of play.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{had another}} chance to score in the 73rd minute, but Geoff Strong's shot {{following}} a corner <b>went</b> <b>over</b> the crossbar. Ajax extended their lead {{towards the end of}} the half when they counter-attacked and scored courtesy of Groot. Liverpool managed to score in the last minute through Lawler, but they were unable to score any further goals and lost the match 5–1.|$|E
5|$|Luton kicked-off the final, {{and both}} sides enjoyed early spells of possession, moving the ball about briskly. Arsenal tested the Luton back four in the eighth minute, when Davis' pass <b>went</b> <b>over</b> Johnson and the ball was {{collected}} by Thomas on the right flank. Charging towards the penalty area, he was impeded by the incoming Dibble and moved near the byline, but Johnson obstructed his eventual shot at goal. Minutes later, Luton had their first chance of the match from a long free kick, taken by Tim Breacker. The ball reached the Arsenal penalty area, and goalkeeper John Lukic failed to collect it; Harford got {{his head to the}} ball, but it just <b>went</b> <b>over</b> the crossbar. Another Luton free kick, this time in the 13th minute, led to the opening goal. The Arsenal defence failed to clear Preece's incoming delivery, and Foster, thinking quick, managed to slip an angled pass in Brian Stein's direction. The midfielder scored – it was the second goal Arsenal had conceded in the competition.|$|E
60|$|Rollo {{was glad}} to see that the water was no deeper, but was still afraid to <b>go</b> <b>over.</b> He told Jonas he could not <b>go</b> <b>over</b> I here, and that he must go back with him.|$|R
6000|$|They then {{addressed}} {{themselves to}} the water; and entering, Christian began to sink, and crying out to his good friend Hopeful, he said, I sink in deep waters; the billows <b>go</b> <b>over</b> my head, all his waves <b>go</b> <b>over</b> me! Selah.[315] ...|$|R

5|$|On 17 August 1944, Tito {{offered a}} general amnesty {{and many in}} the {{division}} took advantage of this opportunity. During {{the first three weeks}} of September, while hard fighting continued, over 2,000 Bosnians deserted, many taking their weapons with them. They went home, joined the Green Cadres militia or <b>went</b> <b>over</b> to the Ustaše. Many defected to the Partisans, with over 700 having joined the Partisan 3rd Corps by early October.|$|E
5|$|San Marino set a European record {{when they}} <b>went</b> <b>over</b> 20 games without scoring between October 2008 and August 2012. On 8 September 2015, San Marino scored its first away goal in 14 years when Matteo Vitaioli scored against Lithuania in Euro 2016 qualification.|$|E
5|$|Seiderman {{worked with}} Charles Wright on the wigs. These <b>went</b> <b>over</b> a {{flexible}} skull cover that Seiderman created and sewed into place with elastic thread. When {{he found the}} wigs too full he untied one hair {{at a time to}} alter their shape. Kane's mustache was inserted into the makeup surface a few hairs at a time, to realistically vary the color and texture.|$|E
60|$|That is {{the plan}} he always pursued himself. The list made, he would <b>go</b> <b>over</b> it carefully, as he always advised, {{to see that he}} had {{forgotten}} nothing. Then he would <b>go</b> <b>over</b> it again, and strike out everything it was possible to dispense with.|$|R

5|$|Ten {{minutes after}} the first impact, the engines still turning astern, the ship struck again beneath the engine room, tearing open her bottom. She {{instantly}} broke in two just aft of the mainmast. The funnel <b>went</b> <b>over</b> the side and the forepart of the ship sank at once. The stern section, now crowded with men, floated {{for a few minutes}} before sinking.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{struggled}} {{to move to}} the offense, and finally managed a shot on goal in the 25th minute, which was blocked by English goalkeeper Bert Williams. The English counterattacked with three successive clear shots at the goal in minutes 30, 31, and 32, but failed to score. Mortensen twice <b>went</b> <b>over</b> the crossbar, and Tom Finney's header to the top corner was tipped away by Borghi.|$|E
5|$|Trade between tribes {{became more}} {{widespread}} during the Mariposa phase, and the diet continued to improve. Paiutes, Miwok, and Monos visited {{the area to}} trade; one major trading route <b>went</b> <b>over</b> Mono Pass and through Bloody Canyon to Mono Lake in Eastern California.|$|E

5|$|Vasari {{suggests}} that the tomb <b>went</b> <b>over</b> budget, costing 1,000florins, although it is unclear who covered the excess. Although the original source for this claim is unknown, it has gained credence with modern scholars as the effigy alone would have cost 500florins, yet its exactness may be taken {{with a grain of}} salt.|$|E
5|$|A minute later, West Ham {{went ahead}} again; defender Paul Konchesky {{received}} {{the ball on}} the left flank, and played a ball into the Liverpool penalty area, only to see it sail over goalkeeper Reina and into the goal. Three minutes later, Liverpool made another substitution, as Alonso went off with an injury to be replaced by defender Jan Kromkamp. Minutes later, West Ham captain Nigel Reo-Coker had an attempt to score, but his shot <b>went</b> <b>over</b> the Liverpool goal. West Ham subsequently made their first substitution of the match, as Ashton was replaced by fellow striker Bobby Zamora. Liverpool also replaced Crouch with midfielder Dietmar Hamann.|$|E
5|$|After 1529, {{resistance}} to John I in Transylvania was broken {{in a series}} of small campaigns. For instance, the last Transylvanian magnate to side with Ferdinánd I, Stephen Majláth <b>went</b> <b>over</b> to John I in early 1532, and Sibiu was occupied in 1536. On February 24, 1538, a secret pact was signed in Oradea by the representatives of the two kings of Hungary. According to the treaty, both rulers were allowed to retain the territories which they then held, but the childless John I promised to recognize the Habsburgs' succession.|$|E

5|$|After Animaniacs, Spielberg {{collaborated with}} Warner Bros. Animation again {{to produce the}} {{short-lived}} series Steven Spielberg Presents Freakazoid, along with the Animaniacs spin-off series Pinky and the Brain, from which Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain was later spun off. Warner Bros. also produced two other comedy animated series in the later half of the decade titled Histeria! and Detention, which were short-lived and unsuccessful compared to the earlier series. Later, Warner Bros. cut back {{the size of its}} animation studio because the show Histeria! <b>went</b> <b>over</b> its budget, and most production on further Warner Bros. animated comedy series ceased.|$|E
5|$|An {{offshoot}} of the work at MIT {{was the beginning of}} digital circuit design theory by one of Bush's graduate students, Claude Shannon. Working on the analytical engine, Shannon described the application of Boolean algebra to electronic circuits in his landmark master's thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits. In 1935, Bush was approached by OP-20-G, which was searching for an electronic device to aid in codebreaking. Bush was paid a $10,000 fee to design the Rapid Analytical Machine (RAM). The project <b>went</b> <b>over</b> budget and was not delivered until 1938, when it was found to be unreliable in service. Nonetheless, it was an important step toward creating such a device.|$|E
5|$|Another one of Heffron's {{election}} promises, namely a Royal Commission {{into the}} legalisation of off-course betting, caused considerable tension {{with his own}} cabinet. His Attorney General Reg Downing favoured its legalisation through a government-supervised Totalisator Agency Board (TAB) while his Chief Secretary Gus Kelly favoured legalising the activities of existing SP bookmakers. Downing however, <b>went</b> <b>over</b> Heffron's head and procured an ALP State Executive order requiring {{the establishment of a}} TAB. When the Final Report of Commission was handed down on 29 March 1963, echoing the position of Downing, Heffron was obliged to carry out the establishment of the TAB.|$|E
