500|$|According to McGuire, {{the game}} {{did not start}} with any game plan to get Chamberlain 100 points. After a few minutes, the Warriors led 19–3, and their star center had already scored 13 points and made his first five shots. At {{the end of the}} first quarter, the Knicks trailed 42–26, and in his typical style, Chamberlain had already scored 23 points, making all nine of his free throws. Free throws were the weakest part of his game, making barely more than half in his first seasons. He had started {{shooting}} free throws underhanded that season per McGuire's suggestion. Chamberlain at that point was thinking more about a free throw shooting record than scoring a lot of points; the NBA record was 24 free throws made in a game. Imhoff was soon benched because of foul trouble. After one foul, he snapped at the referee, [...] "Well, why don't you just give the guy a hundred now and we'll all go home!" [...] Neither referee had ever been a lead official before, and Imhoff privately wished a stronger lead <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>the</b> game. By halftime, the Warriors had lost some of their edge, but still led 79–68. Chamberlain's point total stood at 41. The Warriors felt little excitement, as he had scored 60 or more points on 15 previous occasions. [...] "I often came into the locker room with 30 or 35 points, therefore, 41 points was not a big deal", Chamberlain later explained. During halftime, the Warriors' Guy Rodgers said, [...] "Let's get the ball to Dip. Let's see how many he can get." [...] McGuire agreed.|$|E

2500|$|For the 6.00 am shift change, the signalmen had {{developed}} an informal arrangement allowing whoever <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>the</b> early day shift to arrive for work at around 6.30 am.

[...] The need for signalman Tinsley to complete the missing train register entries may have distracted him from checking that all of the necessary procedures had been carried out by Meakin before the handover of the box.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, Sheffield {{wrote that}} the new German defences built behind the third {{position}} in the onset of autumn required a series of bite and hold attacks, which were beyond {{the ability of the}} British to arrange in time to reach open country. In late September, Haig had ordered an ambitious three-army offensive operation toward Cambrai but despite showing increasing tactical skill and inflicting many losses on the Germans, the territorial gains were [...] "miserly". Haig persisted because he believed that attrition <b>was</b> <b>working,</b> <b>the</b> BEF was improving and that he overestimated the capacity of the armies in a wet and muddy season. The pressure from Joffre to continue was also significant and Haig wrote sympathetically of Cavan's protest in November but that the French could not be left in the lurch. In late October Haig reminded Joffre that although subordinate to French strategy he retained discretion over the operational and tactical matters of where, when and how.|$|E
2500|$|White met Brian Warner on {{numerous}} occasions in the late 1980s. After an unexpected meeting at a used records store in the Coral Springs Mall where White <b>was</b> <b>working,</b> <b>the</b> two realized they had much in common, but had yet {{to work on a}} musical endeavor. White actively attempted to join Manson's band while playing in another project. He became an honorary spooky kid, and went by the groupie name Gordy White. In March 1993, White took part in Manson's side project Mrs. Scabtree and shared vocal duties with then girlfriend Jessicka. Jeordie did not join Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids until Gidget Gein was ejected from the band by the manager in December 1993. White was given the Manson band member name Twiggy Ramirez, which was derived by taking the first name from English supermodel Twiggy and the surname from American serial killer Richard Ramirez. Much of Twiggy's early look from the multi colored dreadlocks down to the dress style was taken directly from Jack Off Jill singer Jessicka and Gidget Gein. White never played bass until Manson bought him his first instrument right after he joined Manson's band. In 1998, White made a cameo in Monster Magnet's music video for [...] "Space Lord". In 2001, White appeared on an MTV Cribs episode: the [...] "Ozzfest Edition".|$|E

2500|$|This {{first two}} matches {{of the show}} were not {{broadcast}} on Television as part of AAA's weekly wrestling show on Televisa but were dark matches that only the fans in attendance at the Plaza de Toros de la Concordia bull fighting arena saw. The opening match featured AAA's women's division with Martha Villalobos, La Nazi and Neftali taking on a trio of women who had primarily worked for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA), La Sirenita, Irma Gonzales and Irma Aguilar. The UWA trio <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>the</b> show due to a work agreement with the UWA, a promotion {{that was one of}} the major Mexican promotions in the 1970s and 1980s but by 1994 was close to going out of business and actually would close in 1995. Villalobos, La Nazi and Neftali defeated the UWA trio, although no records indicated who was pinned. The second Dark Match of the show featured a trio known as Los Misioneros de la Muerte ("The Missionaries of Death"), also originally from the UWA but by this time AAA regulars taking on the team of [...] El Torero, El Mexicano and Dragón de Oro. Los Misioneros originally consisted of El Signo, Negro Navarro and El Texano and later on brought in Black Power II to replace El Texano while working in the UWA. When the group joined AAA Black Power was replaced by a mask wrestler known as Misionero, which may have been Black Power under a mask or possibly former Misionero Rocky Santana, but the identity was never confirmed. Los Misioneros defeated Torero, Mexicano and Dragón de Oro.|$|E
2500|$|Woodcock Forge is {{believed}} to have been built by Jack Dancy of Turners Hill. Hedgecourt Mill is thought to have been remodelled by him about the same time. The pond at Hedgecourt acted as a storage for the Woodcock forge. The tilt hammer was operated by an overshot waterwheel. Another overshot waterwheel worked bellows. In 1574, John Thorpe of Hedgecourt <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>the</b> forge in connection with the furnace at Myllwood. in 1586 Thorpe bought property from William Swanne Sr in the Woodcock Forge area. From 1598 to 1606 the rent was paid by Thomas Thorpe, son of John and in 1629 the forge was leased by John Gage to Richard Thorpe, the son of Thomas. His son, also Richard, held the forge until 1651, when it was forfeit in lieu of a debt. Thorpe's interest in the forge was sold to Simon Everenden of Cliffe near Lewes. In the 1650s the forge was in the occupation of John Newnham. In 1664, the forge was lease by Jeremy Johnson Jr of Charlwood. In 1672, woodland next to the pond was referred to as [...] "Hammerwood" [...] also known as [...] "Wire Wood" [...] thus indicating a drawing mill. John Newnham died in 1707, and his wife died in 1719, but the forge was known as [...] "Mr Johnson's Forge" [...] in 1717. At that time the output from the forge was some [...] per annum. [...] By 1729 the forge was in the occupation of Thomas Stanford, who was converting sows from Heathfield furnace at Woodcock Forge. Stanford does not seem to have had any connections with the Wealden iron industry after 1738. In 1742 Samuel Baker was in occupation, followed by Edward Raby and Alexander Master in 1758. They were supplying the Board of Ordnance with several gauges of bar iron, staff iron and rolled plate. Raby & Master were bankrupt in 1764. Edward Raby died in 1771, and the forge was taken over by his son Alexander until 1774, when the Government forced him to give up Woodcock furnace in a wrangle over the size of his moulds. Joseph Wright and Thomas Pickett took the business, but it is thought that the Hammer Mill ceased to be used c.1787. In 1800, the name Wire Mill is first used.|$|E
