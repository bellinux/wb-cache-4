5|$|Bodanzky {{considered}} the screenplay a key-element {{on the production}} of Brainstorm; it <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>only</b> way of attracting a good cast and staff because it was her first feature film. It aroused interest of lead actors Santoro, Bastos, Kiss, and the producers Sara Silveira, Caio and Fabiano Gullane. Marco Muller, Italian producer of Fabrica Cinema, was also lured by the script, and the film became a Brazil-Italy co-production.|$|E

5|$|On 21 June 1895, the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal {{was opened}} for traffic, {{eight years after}} work had begun. Württemberg and her three sisters, along with dozens of other warships, {{attended}} the ceremonies. The major naval powers sent fleets to join the fleet review. The Autumn 1895 maneuvers simulated a high-seas battle between the I and II Divisions in the North Sea, followed by combined maneuvers {{with the rest of}} the fleet in the Baltic. Württemberg again served during the 1896 and 1897 maneuvers, though Sachsen <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>only</b> sister to join the exercises. Baden and Bayern were out of service for extensive modernization.|$|E

25|$|Guy {{is portrayed}} as a peace-loving elderly man, goaded into war by Raynald of Châtillon, in Egyptian {{director}} Youssef Chahine's 1963 film Al Nasser Salah Ad-Din. Another fictionalised version of him – as an arrogant, scheming villain (and a Templar) – is played by Marton Csokas in the 2005 movie Kingdom of Heaven. The film distorts his relationship with Sibylla, {{which seems to have}} been one of mutual loyalty; it also implies that he <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>only</b> husband, though this is corrected in the director's cut of the film.|$|E

25|$|Upon its release, music critics commended the album's {{cohesive}} {{sound and}} themes throughout, often noting Rowland's most personal and vulnerable lyrics {{as well as}} the strength of her vocals. Talk a Good Game debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 selling 68,000 copies in its opening week, becoming Rowland's third top ten album. The album also debuted at number four on the US R/Hip-Hop Albums Chart. In 2014, Rowland parted ways with her label, wanting a new start elsewhere and signalling the end of the Talk a Good Game era; the album <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>only</b> release under Republic Records.|$|E
25|$|A wicket-keeper {{from the}} VRA Amsterdam club, Pashley made her One Day International (ODI) debut for the Netherlands in August 2006, {{in a series}} against Ireland. Over the {{following}} two years, she and Violet Wattenberg were in constant competition for the wicket-keeping position in the team. On several occasions, both players were named in the same team, with one playing as a specialist batsman. Pashley's final appearances for the Netherlands came when the West Indies toured in July 2008. She played in three out of the four ODIs on tour, {{and in the second}} of two Twenty20 Internationals, which <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>only</b> appearance in that format.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} few years, Kasperek firmly {{established}} herself as one of Scotland's leading all-rounders. One of her first notable performances came against Hampshire in the 2009 edition of the County Championship, when she took 3/2 from six overs to help bowl the side out for 76. Later in the year, against the Netherlands at the 2009 European Championship, she scored a maiden half-century for Scotland, making 58 from 106 balls (including a 135-run partnership with Kari Anderson). During the 2010 County Championship season, Kasperek scored 218 runs from her ten matches, behind only Kathryn White for Scotland. Her best performance was an innings of 68 against Hampshire, which <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>only</b> half-century.|$|E

25|$|Like young {{children}} most of Genie's first words were monosyllabic consonant-vowel-(consonant) sequences, usually consisting of an unaspirated Bilabial stop or dental stop and a monophthong. But while most children's first disyllabic words also follow this pattern, hers had both consonant-vowel and vowel-consonant sequences. Unusually, {{from the very}} first disyllabic words Genie more fully articulated, except when referring to herself by her (real) name she immediately demonstrated proper stress patterns. For approximately two years the length of time she held out a vowel <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>only</b> stress indicator, and during that time was very exaggerated. People unfamiliar with her speech said she sounded either like a deaf child or someone with cerebral palsy, although trained speech pathologists only said the latter.|$|E
25|$|After {{adopting}} {{basketball player}} Nancy Lieberman's exercise plan and using Yonex isometric midsize graphite-fiberglass composite racquets, Navratilova {{became the most}} dominant player in women's tennis. After losing in the fourth round of the first major event of 1983, the French Open, she captured the year's three remaining major titles (the Australian Open was held in December at that time). Navratilova's loss at the French Open <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>only</b> singles defeat during that year, during which she established an 86–1 record. Her winning percentage was the best ever for a post-1968 professional tennis player. During 1982, 1983, and 1984, Navratilova lost a total of only six singles matches. This included a run of 13 consecutive victories over her closest rival and world-ranked No. 2, Chris Evert. Navratilova's reign from 1982 to 1986 is the most dominant unbroken spell in the professional era.|$|E
25|$|After the {{unification}} of Germany, she began competing for the new German team in 1991. She became the country's first post-unification 1500m champion with a win at the German Indoor Athletics Championships. Her winning time of 4:05.50 minutes remains (as of 2015) a championship record. She built on this by winning over the same distance at the German Athletics Championships later that year. She won a 1500m bronze for the hosts at the 1991 European Cup in Frankfurt before going on to take fifth place in the event at the 1991 World Championships in Athletics. She repeated her indoor and outdoor national title double in the 1992 season {{and went on to}} represent Germany at the 1992 Summer Olympics. However, at the Olympics in Barcelona she failed to finish in the first round and was eliminated. This <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>only</b> Olympic appearance and her last major outing at world level. She ended the 1992 season with a win at the Natternbach Silvesterlauf 5K.|$|E

25|$|A outing at the 1990 European Athletics Championships saw her {{pass the}} 3000m heats, but fail {{to finish the}} {{distance}} in the final. This <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>only</b> appearance at the European event. She had a win at the Cross Du Figaro in December that year. Another French record came for Duros in February 1991, when she ran an indoor 3000m best of 8:53.94 minutes. She won the French cross country title {{at the start of}} March and this proved good preparation for the 1991 IAAF World Indoor Championships held the weekend after. Duros outran the competition and won the world indoor title for the 3000m in an improved French indoor record time of 8:50.69 minutes. She was France's first ever gold medallist at the competition proper (Gérard Lelièvre won at the precursor 1985 IAAF World Indoor Games). In the outdoor season she won the French title and also won at the DN Galan in Stockholm – her time of 8:40.76 minutes ranked her eighth globally that year. She failed to carry this form into the final at the 1991 World Championships in Athletics, however, coming last in the final by a margin of over 15 seconds. She had her third and final career win at the Cross Du Figaro {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|After {{failing to}} do so in 1889, Dod was {{determined}} to win Wimbledon three times in a row, starting in 1891. Although it <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>only</b> competitive appearance of that season, she won her third Wimbledon title by defeating Hillyard (6–2, 6–1) in the final of the All-Comers tournament. The reigning champion Lena Rice did not defend her title. 1892 saw Dod's first singles defeat in an open tournament since 1886 when she lost to Louisa Martin of Ireland {{in the second round of}} the Irish Championships. It was the last of only five losses in her entire tennis career and her only defeat after the age of 15. She continued the year strongly, culminating in another easy straight-set Wimbledon victory over Hillyard. Dod's last tennis season as a competitive player was 1893, and she played in just two tournaments, The Northern in Manchester and Wimbledon, winning both. On both occasions, she defeated Blanche Hillyard in three sets, despite a heavy fall in the Wimbledon final. Her record of five Wimbledon titles would not last for long, as Hillyard, after losing in the final to Dod five times, won her sixth title in 1900. Suzanne Lenglen broke Dod's record of three consecutive singles wins by winning from 1919 to 1923.|$|E
