It was prone to display <b>web</b> <b>pages</b> differently from other browsers, causing web developers to spend time tweaking their <b>web</b> <b>pages.</b> Acid2 challenged Microsoft to make Internet Explorer comply with web standards.|$|E

One of such {{approach}} is given by <b>web</b> <b>page</b> pre-fetching. The pre-fetching concept is about to avail the <b>web</b> <b>page</b> to user before the user demand. It means as the user is visiting some page the next page that he visit will be copied to the user cache. In this present work we are performing an intelligent <b>web</b> <b>page</b> prediction approach based on history of <b>web</b> <b>page</b> visit.

5|$|Data URIs: The actual {{images that}} form the eyes are encoded as data URIs, which allow {{multimedia}} to be embedded in <b>web</b> <b>pages</b> rather than stored as a separate file. Acid2 tests the most common case, where a binary image is base64-encoded into text and then that encoded text is included in a data URI in the web page. Although the IETF published the data URI specification in 1998, they never formally adopted it as a standard. Nonetheless, the HTML 4.01 specification references the data URI scheme, and data URI support has now been implemented in most browsers.|$|E
40|$|<b>Web</b> <b>page</b> {{representation}} {{is a topic}} of concern for small screen devices, like, mobile, palm, etc. In a web-page, bulk of irrelevant data including advertisements and other noisy information’s create access inconvenience. <b>Web</b> <b>page</b> segmentation is a technique which resolves this problem by logically dividing a <b>web</b> <b>page</b> into segments. These segments can be created by using DOM (Document Object Model) and VIPS (Visual Page Segmentation) techniques. In this paper, a hybrid method of <b>web</b> <b>page</b> segmentation has been designed using combination of DOM method and VIPS algorithm for developing segments from a <b>web</b> <b>page.</b> Here both the structural and visual aspects of a <b>web</b> <b>page</b> to create a segment have been considered. A segment is such a basic unit of <b>web</b> <b>page</b> which cannot be further divided. This is done by processing a <b>web</b> <b>page</b> through a BLOCK CREATION ALGORITHM which is discussed further...|$|R
50|$|A <b>web</b> <b>page,</b> or webpage, is a {{document}} that is suitable for the World Wide Web and web browsers. A web browser displays a <b>web</b> <b>page</b> on a monitor or mobile device. The <b>web</b> <b>page</b> is what displays, but the term also refers to a computer file, usually written in HTML or comparable markup language.

5|$|Originally {{designed}} to create dynamic <b>web</b> <b>pages,</b> PHP now focuses mainly on server-side scripting, and it is similar to other server-side scripting languages that provide dynamic content from a web server to a client, such as Microsoft's Classic ASP, Sun Microsystems' JavaServer Pages, and mod_perl. PHP has also attracted the development of many software frameworks that provide building blocks and a design structure to promote rapid application development (RAD). Some of these include PRADO, CakePHP, Symfony, CodeIgniter, Laravel, Yii Framework, Phalcon and Zend Framework, offering features similar to other web frameworks.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{access to}} illegal content (such as child pornography) was {{strictly}} self-regulated by individual internet service providers. This began when BT Group introduced Cleanfeed, a server-side filtering system which uses {{data obtained from}} the Internet Watch Foundation. The IWF is a Quango organisation that operates a website where users can report <b>web</b> <b>pages</b> containing illegal or dubious content {{to be added to}} their blacklists. This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the Protection of Children Act. British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.|$|E
5|$|Some {{international}} broadcasters {{have turned}} to a digital mode of broadcasting called Digital Radio Mondiale for their shortwave outlets. One reason is that digital shortwave broadcasts using DRM can cover the same geographic region with much less transmitter power — roughly one-fifth the power — than traditional AM mode broadcasts, significantly reducing the electricity cost of operating a station. A traditional AM (analog) international shortwave station can have a power rating of 50 kilowatts {{to as much as}} one million watts per transmitter, with typical power levels in the 50–500 kilowatt range. Endorsed by the ITU, it has been approved as an international standard for digital broadcasts on the HF (shortwave) bands. A DRM broadcast rivals FM mono quality and can also send graphic images and <b>web</b> <b>pages</b> via a separate information channel.|$|E

5|$|Unbeknownst to the band, their fanbase was {{connecting}} {{and growing}} on the internet, which was helping to boost the reputation and sales of Pinkerton. When it was released, Pinkerton was considered a critical and commercial failure; however, {{in the years following}} the release of the album, it would gain a much more positive reputation due to word-of-mouth on message boards and various <b>web</b> <b>pages.</b> This expanding internet activity would later {{set the stage for the}} band's 2001 comeback. Renewed interaction between band members took place when Weezer was offered a lucrative offer to perform in Japan in August 2000 for the Summer Sonic Festival. Rehearsals for the show reinvigorated the band into talking about making a new album. The band returned to performing in June 2000, playing low-key shows around Los Angeles under the pseudonym Goat Punishment, ensuring that Weezer would only perform for longtime fans who would recognize the name.|$|E
