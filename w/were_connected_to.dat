5|$|A {{peculiar}} {{feature of}} Muslim castles in the Iberian Peninsula {{was the use}} of detached towers, called Albarrana towers, around the perimeter as can be seen at the Alcazaba of Badajoz. Probably developed in the 12thcentury, the towers provided flanking fire. They <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> the castle by removable wooden bridges, so if the towers were captured the rest of the castle was not accessible.|$|E

5|$|The Metropolitan Sewerage & Water Supply {{authority}} {{took over}} control of the pumping station from 1901 until 1910, when both the prison and town <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> Perth's metropolitan water supply. The tunnels were closed in 1910, but the groundwater continued to be used for the prison's gardens. In 1989, oil leaking from nearby tanks contaminated the water. The pollution was eventually cleared by 1996 through bioremediation.|$|E
5|$|The oil shale-fired {{electrical}} power industry started in 1924 when the Tallinn Power Station switched to oil shale. In 1933, it reached {{a capacity of}} 22megawatts (MW). Other oil shale-fired power stations were built in Püssi (3.7MW), Kohtla (3.7MW), Kunda (2.3MW), and Kiviõli (0.8MW). At the beginning of World War II, the total capacity of oil shale-fired power stations was 32.5MW. Only the Tallinn and Püssi power stations <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> the grid.|$|E
5|$|Under Mandela's presidency, welfare {{spending}} increased by 13% in 1996/97, 13% in 1997/98, and 7% in 1998/99. The government introduced parity in grants for communities, including disability grants, child maintenance grants, and old-age pensions, which {{had previously been}} set at different levels for South Africa's different racial groups. In 1994, free healthcare was introduced for children under six and pregnant women, a provision extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996. By the 1999 election, the ANC could boast that due to their policies, 3 million people <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> telephone lines, 1.5 million children were brought into the education system, 500 clinics were upgraded or constructed, 2 million people <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> the electricity grid, water access was extended to 3 million people, and 750,000 houses were constructed, housing nearly 3 million people.|$|E

5|$|Until 1864, {{communications}} between Fort Greble {{and its neighbors}} had to be routed through departmental headquarters in Washington. After {{a test of the}} system completely failed, efforts were made to establish signaling points between the forts, and the forts themselves <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> Washington via telegraph wire. Signal detachments were present at Fort Stanton, near Uniontown, and sometimes visited Fort Greble as part of training efforts.|$|E
5|$|In 1735, Euler {{presented}} {{a solution to}} the problem known as the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> each other and the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory, specifically of planar graph theory.|$|E
5|$|Some users {{reported}} that 64 and 128GB iPhone 6 models had experienced performance issues, {{and that some}} 128GB iPhone 6 Plus models would, in rare cases, randomly crash and reboot. Business Korea {{reported that}} the issues <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> the triple-layer cell NAND storage of the affected models. Triple-layer cells can store three bits of data per cell of flash, and are cheaper than dual-layer cell solutions, but {{at the cost of}} performance. It was reported that Apple had planned to switch the affected model lines back to multi-layer cell flash, and address the performance issues on existing devices in a future iOS update.|$|E

5|$|Stephenson {{built the}} {{locomotive}} originally as an 0-4-0 (an 0-4-0 is the Whyte notation for a steam locomotive with two powered axles and no unpowered leading or trailing axles). The locomotive's power was {{transmitted to the}} driving axles through pistons that were mounted under the boiler between the two front wheels {{and in front of}} the front axle. These inside cylinders' main rods <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> a rear crank axle with a connecting rod between the two axles to power the front axle.|$|E
5|$|The Mac Pro had one PATA {{port and}} could support two PATA devices in the optical drive bays. It {{had a total}} of six SATA ports– four <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> the system's drive bays, and two were not connected. The extra SATA ports could be put into service through the use of {{after-market}} extender cables to connect internal optical drives, or to provide eSATA ports with the use of an eSATA bulkhead connector. However, the two extra SATA ports were unsupported and disabled under Boot Camp.|$|E
5|$|The double {{election}} {{was a result}} of the growing tensions inside the College of Cardinals concerning the policy of the Holy See towards the Holy Roman Empire, initiated by the Concordat of Worms (1122), which ended the investiture controversy. Several, particularly older, cardinals considered the compromise achieved in Worms as desertion of the principles of the Gregorian Reform, and inclined to accept it only as a tactical move. They supported the traditional alliance of the Papacy with the Normans in southern Italy. Some of them <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> old monastic centers in Southern Italy such as Montecassino. One of their leaders was Cardinal Pierleoni, representative {{of one of the most}} powerful families of Rome.|$|E

5|$|The radar {{technology}} was not flawless. It struggled to gauge heights of incoming formations above 25,000 feet {{and could not}} measure their numerical strength. It could also take several minutes to assess the line of advance for aircraft on a zigzag course. Moreover, the radar looked out to sea {{and was unable to}} track aircraft overland. That was the job of the Royal Observer Corps. Tens of thousands of volunteers, the length and breadth of Britain tracked the German formations over land. They <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> Sector airfields by landline and could communicate intelligence in real time.|$|E
5|$|William de Ufford's first marriage, to Joan Montagu, {{brought him}} {{significant}} land holdings in Norfolk. With Joan {{he had at}} least five children, none of whom survived him, and his second marriage, to Isabel, was apparently childless. The lands he had acquired through Joan were reunited with the earldom of Norfolk, while his patrimony reverted to the crown. According to the late earl's will, much of the Suffolk lands – though not the title – descended on the Willoughby family, who <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> the Uffords through marriage. In 1385, the earldom of Suffolk was restored for Michael de la Pole, who received a great portion of Ufford's lands to support his title.|$|E
5|$|With {{the design}} process complete, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle {{possessing}} 65 panels and costing $250,000 to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six propane tanks. The visibility inside the vehicle was poor, so monitors <b>were</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> cameras on the vehicle body. The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove {{on the streets of}} Chicago for the film's scenes.|$|E
