5|$|It is {{believed}} that some Irish MacIntyres descend from native Irish stock whose ancestors <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same areas in which Scottish MacIntyres settled and who assumed the Scottish surname, rather than Macateer, as an anglicization of the Irish name Mac an tSoir.|$|E
5|$|British Cypriot people {{include those}} of Greek-, Turkish-, Maronite-, or Armenian-Cypriot descent. The National Federation of Cypriots in the UK, an {{umbrella}} organisation representing the Cypriot community associations and groups across the UK with largely Greek Cypriot memberships, claims to represent more than 300,000 people of Cypriot ancestry, {{although they do}} not state {{whether or not this}} includes non-Greek Cypriots. A similar figure was given by then Minister for Europe Caroline Flint, who, giving a speech at the London School of Economics in February 2009, stated that more than 300,000 Greek and Turkish Cypriots <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK.|$|E

5|$|One {{estimate}} {{states that}} 130,000nationals of the breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) {{resided in the}} UK in 2008, a figure also given by the Turkish consulate in London, whereas the Museum of London reports that 100,000Turkish Cypriots live in Britain—20,000 more than in Cyprus itself. Nergis Canefe suggests a figure of 190,000, whereas the TRNC Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggested in May 2001 that 200,000 Turkish Cypriots <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom. Evidence submitted by the Home Office to the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee in February 2011 suggested that there were about 300,000 Turkish Cypriots living in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Temple {{was born}} to Sir Alexander Temple and Mary Sommer while his parents <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parish of St. Margaret's in Rochester, Kent in the house {{previously}} owned by his mother's first husband.

His father had been knighted at the Tower of London by James I following the King's accession to the English throne - one of many members of the gentry who were knighted during {{the first years of the}} King's reign.|$|E
5|$|The Centre Turnpike was {{constructed}} in 1770 and provided access to the valley of Roaring Creek, roughly following the current course of Pennsylvania Route 487 and Pennsylvania Route 54. The Reading Road was later constructed in the watershed and ran in a southeasterly direction. Quakers <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> valley of the creek by the 1770s and land on the creek was patented to Samuel Shakespeare in 1773. A number of settlers arrived in the valley from the Philadelphia area via the Reading Road. Soon {{after the end of}} the American Revolutionary War, farms were appearing along the creek's banks.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{settlement}} of the Americas occurred some 20,000 years ago, when the first Asians crossed the Bering Strait into Alaska, the earliest archaeological evidence of human habitation of the Bay Area dates to around 3,000 B.C. along {{the shores of the}} bay, with evidence pointing to even earlier settlement in Point Reyes in Marin County. The Miwokan and Costanoan Ohlone people, who <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bay Area at the time of first European contact, were possibly descended from Siberian tribes who arrived at around 1,000 BC by sailing over the Arctic Ocean and following the salmon migration. The Ohlone lived in about forty or so tribes spread throughout the lands adjacent to the San Francisco Bay and as far south as Point Sur in near Monterey Bay.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that there were 1,800 Jews in Albania {{at the end of}} the Second World War, eleven times the number of Jews that <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country in 1939. The Jewish community in Kosovo never fully recovered from the war. Few Jews remained in Kosovo and many emigrated to Israel during the communist period. Similarly, most Jews in Albania decided to emigrate following the communist takeover. About 300 remained in the country until the early 1990s. The official Albanian census of April 1989 recorded 73 Jews living in the country. With the fall of Communism, Albania eased restrictions on religion and foreign travel, which resulted in virtually the entire Jewish community of the country emigrating to Israel. From December 1990 to June 1991, 350 Albanian Jews were airlifted from Albania to Israel in what was codenamed Operation Flying Carpet. Most of Albania's 60 remaining Jews left in 1997, after the country became engulfed in a brief civil war.|$|E

5|$|The dispute did not delay work. Although {{progress}} on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict {{the scope of the}} project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> construction camp. As area engineer, Matthias exercised overall control of the site. At its peak, the construction camp was the third most populous town in Washington state. Hanford operated a fleet of over 900 buses, more than the city of Chicago. Like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, Richland was a gated community with restricted access, but it looked more like a typical wartime American boomtown: the military profile was lower, and physical security elements like high fences, towers, and guard dogs were less evident.|$|E
