500|$|In North America, the Series (particularly {{the first}} few games) exposed the need for better {{preparation}} and off-season training. Philadelphia Flyers coach Fred Shero became an avid student of the Soviet style {{and was one of}} the first to bring the Soviet training techniques to the NHL as the Flyers won two Stanley Cup championships in 1974 and 1975. Tom Mellor (who joined the small but rapidly growing group of American-born NHL players after the 1972 Olympics) lamented that the NHL training methods of the early 1970s were vastly inferior to those of the Soviets. [...] "When I went to play for Detroit after the Olympics, Alex Delvecchio was the coach.... When he would coach, we would do a couple of one-on-ones, two-on-twos, three-on-twos, we'd scrimmage, and he would scrimmage <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> <b>At</b> the end of the scrimmage, we'd do a couple of figure eights and then go to the bar. That was the NHL and pro mentality." [...] Mark Howe commented that the Soviet national team must have trained six hours on the day of a game in the 1972 Winter Olympics. On the other hand, Swedish sports journalists were extremely impressed by the toughness and [...] "never say die" [...] fighting spirit of the Canadians, who lost only one game out of seven on European ice despite usually trailing in the third period. According to Soviet player Boris Mikhailov, who later became a coach, [...] "it was a meeting between two schools of hockey and we have since continued this great exchange and we have learned from each other, taking the best of both styles." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with io9 on 28 July 2009, creator Russell T Davies {{was asked about the}} controversy surrounding Ianto's death and the fan reaction campaign. He replied [...] "There's a campaign, because he was a coffee boy. But {{do you know how many}} packets of coffee they've received so far? Nine. So I think people writing online might sound like thousands of people, but they are nine." [...] However, those involved in the movement believe that this number is much higher due to a post tallying the coffee sent within the community. When asked about the backlash in a separate interview with Michael Ausiello, Russell T Davies said [...] "It's not particularly a backlash. What's actually happening is, well, nothing really to be honest. It's a few people posting online and getting fans upset". He also stated that the character was gone for good, and that his resurrection would devalue the [...] "entire plot." [...] He recommended that fans who wish to stop watching the show should watch Supernatural [...] "because those boys are beautiful", or [...] "look at poetry" [...] if they [...] "can't handle drama". Following these statements, the Save Ianto Jones website encouraged fans to contact BBC Wales rather than Davies, and temporarily presented on its front page the message [...] "Mr Davies has made it clear in recent interviews that he views his fans with contempt, and as disposable, which saddens us" [...] and asked not to be [...] "abused". At Comic-Con 2009, a fan claimed that Davies [...] "hurt" [...] a lot of internet fans with his decision to kill Ianto, which she called [...] "out of line." [...] Davies replied that he would not change his mind regarding the decision, adding, [...] "I've got to be blunt about this, there have been campaigns to send packets of coffee to BBC Wales in protest. There have been nine packets sent. I'm not taking the mickey, but that's a very small number." [...] Executive producer Julie Gardner stated [...] "We want people to be engaged, discuss and not always agree <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> <b>At</b> the end of the day, I make drama to support each author's vision. It's not a democracy. Whether people like it or not, it's storytelling." [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek has criticised the Internet campaigns to resurrect the character, citing that the show would [...] "lose far more credibility" [...] if he were brought back. Brew also expressed doubt that the fans stating they would boycott a fourth series will do so. He summarised: [...] "Torchwood now needs to continue to have the courage of its convictions, and for that to happen, the reset switch simply isn't an option." ...|$|E

The cantata, in Bach's chorale cantata format, is based on Martin Luther's hymn [...] "WÃ¤r Gott nicht mit uns diese Zeit". Its text paraphrases Psalm 124, focussing on the thought that our life depends on God's help and is lost without it.|$|E

In an interview given with Digital Spy, Diederick Santer said: [...] "When Danniella and I first sat down to talk about her return, we discussed a particular storyline with a specific length of contract.

2500|$|The opening chorus, [...] "" [...] (Were God not <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>at</b> this time), is a chorale fantasia on the hymn tune. Luther's hymn is sung to {{the same}} melody as [...] "" [...] by Justus Jonas, which Bach had treated to a chorale cantata, [...] The opening chorus is an unusual {{composition}} that does not follow the scheme of instrumental ritornellos with a cantus firmus, sung line by line by the soprano in long notes. In a setting resembling a motet, the strings play colla parte with the voices, and each line of the chorale is prepared by a complex four-part counter-fugue, in which the first entrance of a theme is answered in its inversion. After preparing entrances, the chorale melody is not sung but played by the horn and the oboes in long notes, creating a five-part composition, which is unique in Bach's cantata movements. The only other piece of similar complexity, also giving the cantus firmus to the instruments, is the opening chorus of , {{but it is not}} conceived as a counter-fugue.|$|E
