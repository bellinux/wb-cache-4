2500|$|The {{volume of}} essays Irepetabilul trecut ("The Unrepeatable Past") also saw print in 1994, and largely dealt with post-communist Romanian history. Bogdan Cristian Iacob {{describes}} it as [...] "an expression of the priorities of those years, {{from the perspective of}} democratization and civil society consolidation" [...] coupled with [...] "a <b>working</b> <b>site</b> of ideas" [...] for later works. The volume, Iacob notes, is structured as a typical work on the history of ideas, and, with [...] "beneficent obstinacy", builds on Tismăneanu's [...] "principal themes". In Iacob's view, [...] "the most important" [...] are: [...] "the basic criminality of Bolshevism in any of its incarnations; the attachment to civic liberalism modeled on the experience of Central and Eastern European dissidence; the totalitarian past's reclamation the research into Romania's communist experience; and, not least of all, the local environment's epistemic synchronization with debates in the Anglo-Saxon space." [...] Under the influence of Jürgen Habermas and Karl Jaspers, the text proposes that social cohesion is only made possible by the common recognition of past evils around the idea of justice (see Historikerstreit). In particular, the essays reject the policies of Romania's major post-communist left-wing group, the National Salvation Front and those of its successor, the Social Democratic Party (PSD), arguing that their policies were a political hybrid designed to block the path of genuinely anti-communist liberalism. Irepetabilul trecut was the first such work to be noted for its biographical sketches of communist leaders.|$|E

Twelve time-integrated mass flux samplers were strategically deployed over two contrasting campaign periods (summer and winter). Suspended sediment samples were characterised magnetically and subjected to metal analysis. Metal levels in the upper River Sheaf showed a marked spatial {{and temporal}} variability. Pb concentrations in particular were relatively high (maximum 2132 mg kg- 1). Their distribution tended to reflect the historical contamination of the valley by 17 th to 19 th century industry, especially during summer high discharge conditions.

The work highlights a very serious situation in both investigated working environments where all measures of job safety are systematically ignored. In conclusion, we recommend that for a significant reduction of serious and fatal accidents, a mandatory training should be extended to all chainsaws users.
