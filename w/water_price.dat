For example, the city of Toluca in Mexico State charges residential users 8.7 pesos (US$0.70)/ m3 for a consumption of 30 m3.

Water resource managers are considering the policy of reallocating {{a portion of the}} water supply from agriculture to other uses. It is believed that increasing irrigation <b>water</b> <b>prices</b> could influence <b>water</b> consumption and thus make water available for non-agricultural (more economic) uses. This paper examines the impacts of <b>water</b> <b>pricing</b> on agricultural <b>water</b> consumption and farming profitability and provides some guidelines for policy makers regarding <b>water</b> <b>pricing</b> as a tool to manage scarce water resources. We estimate a regression model describing agricultural water consumption as a function of <b>water</b> <b>prices,</b> irrigated land area, farm income, and irrigation frequency, using data collected in a survey of about 150 farmers in the Tulkarm district. We conclude that irrigation <b>water</b> <b>prices</b> are perceived as high and comprise a large portion of total farming expenses. Therefore, attempts to increase irrigation <b>water</b> <b>prices</b> in the Tulkarm district might jeopardize farming feasibility and might have substantial impacts on agricultural water consumption. Nevertheless, many farmers would continue farming even if the <b>water</b> <b>prices</b> were increased beyond their willingness to pay threshold.

40|$|The 2003 CAP reform {{considerably}} affects cropping {{patterns in}} European agriculture. At {{the same time}} the imperatives of the forthcoming Water Framework Directive (WFD) is expected to modify irrigation decisions especially in Southern Europe where irrigated agriculture utilizes about 70 - 80 % of total water. This paper examines the combined effect of CAP reform and the application of likely volumetric <b>water</b> <b>pricing</b> on <b>water</b> demand by taking into account three drivers of change, namely extensive margin changes, intensive margin changes and irrigation technology shift. For low rates of <b>water</b> <b>prices,</b> CAP reform contradicts the WFD objectives since it leads to cropping patterns that consume more water resources. On the contrary, as <b>water</b> <b>prices</b> increase, decoupling and <b>water</b> <b>pricing</b> display a synergistic effect on water conservation. Finally, decoupling substantially increases the efficiency of <b>water</b> <b>pricing</b> in terms of water conservation. As a result, the post CAP reform regime clearly dominates the prior CAP reform regime when an index of value for money water conservation is examined. irrigation, bio-economic modeling, mathematical programming, policy analysis, <b>price</b> endogenous model, <b>water</b> demand, CAP reform, WFD...|$|R

40|$|Water {{scarcity}} is {{a growing}} problem world wide. Economists uniformly suggest <b>water</b> <b>pricing</b> to improve <b>water</b> use efficiency; however, governments tend to reject that advice due to political risk, and economic and cultural concerns. This dissertation addresses questions of what policy alternatives to <b>water</b> <b>pricing</b> {{could be used to}} improve irrigation water allocation efficiency. It provides an empirical framework with which to compare alternative irrigation polices for allocating limited water to agricultural production in Egypt and Morocco. The Agricultural Sector Model of Egypt (ASME) and the Agricultural Sector Model of Morocco (ASMM) were employed for policy tests. Both are partial equilibrium models in which consumer and producer surplus from agricultural based commodities is maximized subject to various resource, technical, and policy constraints. Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) was used for model calibration, which renders the models more suitable for doing policy analysis. Three policy options were tested: <b>water</b> <b>pricing,</b> <b>water</b> complementary input factor taxes, and output taxes. ^ The research results for Egypt are: (1) irrigation water demand in Egypt is inelastic; (2) N-fertilizer tax policy, energy tax policy, and output tax policy at certain rates can be alternatives to <b>water</b> <b>pricing</b> policy to decrease the planted area of water intensive and low market value crops; and (3) both input factor tax and output tax policy can be alternatives to <b>water</b> <b>pricing</b> to generate revenue for government. ^ The results for Morocco are: (1) water demand is responsive to <b>water</b> <b>pricing</b> policy; (2) output taxes can be an alternative to <b>water</b> <b>pricing</b> at the cost recovery level; (3) energy taxes may not be a good mechanism to reduce water demand until it is very high; and (4) both energy taxes and output taxes can generate comparable revenues to the revenue generated from <b>water</b> <b>pricing</b> at cost recovery level. ^ Policy implications based on key findings are summarized to provide policy makers a reference for their irrigation policy consideration. Limitations of the model are discussed and suggestions for future research are made. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{light of}} the actual {{economic}} circumstances and <b>water</b> <b>price</b> level, the CGE model to simulate the price policy for multiple water sources is modified and expanded. A <b>water</b> <b>price</b> reform plan is proposed to meet water-saving requirements and water resources allocation. The affected scale and scope for implementing the <b>water</b> <b>price</b> policy is evaluated on a quantitative basis. Research results indicate that a reasonable <b>water</b> <b>price</b> system in Tianjin in 2020 should be set up as follows: the comprehensive tap <b>water</b> <b>price</b> stands at 4 $/m 3, the tap <b>water</b> <b>price</b> for industrial, administrative and business service sectors is 2. 4 $/m 3, and the tap <b>water</b> <b>price</b> for special industry and domestic use are 8. 8 $/m 3 and 1. 4 $/m 3 respectively.

Although most sectors are negatively affected to varying degrees after raising the <b>water</b> <b>price,</b> particularly the lodging and catering sectors, a 100 % <b>water</b> <b>price</b> rising will produce only little impact on price index, and sectoral output and employment will not cause economic fluctuations or social instability. <b>Water</b> <b>price</b> adjustments, {{as long as it}} is reasonable, will be more positive than negative on the whole.
