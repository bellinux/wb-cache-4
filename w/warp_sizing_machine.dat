40|$|Modern GPUs {{synchronize}} threads grouped in a warp {{at every}} instruction. These results in improving SIMD efficiency and makes sharing fetch and decode resources possible. The {{number of threads}} included in each <b>warp</b> (or <b>warp</b> <b>size)</b> affects divergence, synchronization overhead and the efficiency of memory access coalescing. Small warps reduce the performance penalty associated with branch and memory divergence {{at the expense of}} a reduction in memory coalescing. Large warps enhance memory coalescing significantly but also increase branch and memory divergence. Dynamic workload behavior, including branch/memory divergence and coalescing, {{is an important factor in}} determining the <b>warp</b> <b>size</b> returning best performance. Optimal <b>warp</b> <b>size</b> can vary from one workload to another or from one program phase to the next. Based on this observation, we propose Dynamic Warp Resizing (DWR). DWR takes innovative microarchitectural steps to adjust <b>warp</b> <b>size</b> during runtime and according to program characteristics. DWR outperforms static <b>warp</b> <b>size</b> decisions, up to 1. 7 X to 2. 28 X, while imposing less than 1 % area overhead. We investigate various alternative configurations and show that DWR performs better for narrower SIMD and larger caches.

Currently, {{the number of}} threads in a <b>warp</b> (<b>warp</b> <b>size)</b> is 32, which is physically executed simultaneously. Besides proper memory usage, warp conflict avoidance is essential [27]. The vendor suggests block sizes multiple of the <b>warp</b> <b>size</b> to achieve the most efficient computation. However, in extreme situations, optimal block size can differ from the advised values [28]. If some threads in the warp choose different branches of operation based on the processed data, the threads within the warp may diverge. This is called warp desynchronization and results in the serialization of some threads which adds runtime delay. As a rule of thumb, the block size should be a multiple of 32 and each multiprocessor should execute at least six warps {{at the same time}} because the pipeline is six levels deep; therefore, 8 × 32 = 256 may be an ideal thread number.|$|R

30|$|We {{can reduce}} the number of idle threads by {{reducing}} the total number of threads per block and also using each thread to load multiple pixels into the shared memory.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of design {{decisions}} that impact a GPU's performance. Among such decisions deciding the right <b>warp</b> <b>size</b> can deeply influence the rest of the design. Small warps reduce the performance penalty associated with branch divergence at the expense of a reduction in memory coalescing. Large warps enhance memory coalescing significantly but also increase branch divergence. This leaves designers with two choices: use a small warps and invest in finding new solutions to enhance coalescing or use large warps and address branch divergence employing effective control-flow solutions. In this work our goal is to investigate the answer to this question. We analyze <b>warp</b> <b>size</b> impact on memory coalescing and branch divergence. We use our findings to study two machines: a GPU using small warps but equipped with excellent memory coalescing (SW+) and a GPU using large warps but employing an MIMD engine immune from control-flow costs (LW+). Our evaluations show that building coalescing-enhanced small warp GPUs is a better approach compared to pursuing a control-flow enhanced large warp GPU.

40|$|High single {{instruction}} multiple data (SIMD) {{efficiency and}} {{low power consumption}} have made graphic processing units (GPUs) an ideal platform for many complex computational applications. Thousands of threads can be created by programmers and grouped into fixed-size SIMD batches, known as warps. High throughput is then achieved by concurrently executing such warps with minimal control overhead. However, if a branch instruction occurs, which assigns different paths to different threads, this warp will be broken into multiple warps {{that have to be}} executed serially, consequently reducing the efficiency advantage of SIMD. In this thesis, the contemporary fixed-size warp design is abandoned and a hybrid <b>warp</b> <b>size</b> (HWS) mechanism is proposed. Mixed-size warps are generated according to HWS and are scheduled and issued flexibly. Once a branch divergence occurs, split warps are squeezed according to the proposed algorithm, and <b>warp</b> <b>sizes</b> are downscaled wherever applicable. Based on updated <b>warp</b> <b>sizes,</b> <b>warp</b> schedulers calculate the number of cycles the current warp needs and issue the next warp accordingly. As a result, hybrid warps are pushed into pipelines as soon as possible and more pipeline stages are overlapped. The simulation results show that this mechanism yields an average speedup of 1. 20 over the baseline architecture {{for a wide variety of}} general purpose GPU applications. This work also integrates HWS with dynamic warp formation (DWF), which is a well-known branch handling mechanism aimed at improving SIMD utilization by forming new warps out of split warps in real time. The warp forming policy is modified to better tolerate warp conflicts. Also, squeeze operations are added before a warp merges with other warps. The simulation shows that the combination of DWF and HWS generates an average speedup of 1. 27 over the DWF-only platform for the same set of GPU benchmarks...|$|R

40|$|<b>Warp</b> <b>sizing</b> is an {{established}} method {{for improving the}} weaveability of textile yarns by coating or impregnating warp yarns with a polymer that improves {{the efficiency of the}} weaving operation. Despite its high cost, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) normally shows better adhesion to fibers than other sizing agents like starch which makes it an essential constituent of size liquor recipe. However PVA desized effluent is a major chemical oxygen demand contributor to a textile plant’s primary oxygenation treatment of water operation and being biologically inert and presents a major threat to the environment. Therefore, the recovery and recycling of PVA will not only be cost-effective but will also be eco-friendly. The aim of this research work is to recycle the <b>warp</b> <b>size</b> materials and to study the comparison of yarn mechanical properties sized with recycled materials to the properties of yarn sized with conventional sizing. Ultrafiltration reverse osmosis technology is used for the recovery and recycling of PVA size material. For this purpose, Ne 16 / 1 and Ne 21 / 1 carded 100 % cotton yarns were used and sized with both conventional sizing recipe and by 50 % recycled PVA together with 50 % fresh sizing recipe. It was found that yarn sized through recycled PVA sizing recipe has almost the same (slightly lower) mechanical properties such as tensile strength, elongation and abrasion resistance as compared to yarn sized through conventional sizing recipe...|$|R
40|$|Two plant proteins, soyprotein {{and wheat}} gluten, and chicken {{feathers}} used to size cotton substrates provided sizing performance similar to starch and were also easily degraded in activated sludge. Sizing {{is an essential}} process to impart protection to warp yarns and increase weaving efficiency. Cotton yarns have traditionally been sized with starch, modified starch derivatives, CMC, poly vinyl alcohol (PVA), or a combination thereof along with quite a few other fiber binding ingredients. Although starch and starch derivatives are extensively used for sizing, there can be several limitations including less-than-satisfactory sizing performance and difficulties in desizing starch based size. Plant proteins such as wheat gluten, soyproteins and poultry feathers are available in large quantities at low cost and have limited industrial applications. However, these proteins {{are known to have}} excellent film-forming properties, a primary requirement for a <b>warp</b> <b>size,</b> and have also been used as adhesives. Using proteins as <b>warp</b> <b>sizing</b> agents on cotton yarns potentially could provide acceptable sizing performance and be cost-effective, as well. In this research, soyproteins, wheat gluten, and chicken feathers were studied for exploring their feasibility for sizing, desizing, biodegradability, and ability to replace starch and PVA for sizing cotton yarns. It was found that all three proteins provided similar cohesion to fibers and abrasion resistance compared to starch. Protein sizes had significantly high BOD 5 /COD ratio compared to PVA, suggesting that the proteins are easily degradable in textile effluent treatment plants...|$|R
