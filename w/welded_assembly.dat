Materials and Methods: The mean tensile weld strength of a weld joint of four arch wires were compared pre-fluoride (Group 1) with post fluoride (Group 2) and the microstructural characteristics of weld joints were evaluated under an optical microscope. Results: The mean tensile weld strength for beta titanium was 445. 64 N/mm 2, blue elgiloy was 363. 26 N/mm 2, SS was 358. 30 N/mm 2 and timolium was 308. 62 N/mm 2. After immersion in fluoride the mean tensile strength for beta titanium was 427. 16 N/mm 2, blue elgiloy was 359. 86 N/mm 2, SS is 349. 44 N/mm 2 and timolium is 294. 86 N/mm 2.
