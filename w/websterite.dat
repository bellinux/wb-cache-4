All pyroxenites display microstructures recording plastic deformation by dislocation creep. Pyroxene CPOs are consistent with dominant slip on [001]{ 110 } in clinopyroxene and on [001](100) or [001](010) in orthopyroxene. Garnet clinopyroxenites have however high recrystallized fractions and finer grain sizes than spinel <b>websterites.</b> Recrystallization mechanisms also differ: subgrain rotation dominates in garnet clinopyroxenites, whereas in spinel <b>websterites</b> nucleation and growth also contribute. Elongated shapes and strong intracrystalline misorientations suggest plastic deformation of garnet, but CPOs are weak. Clinopyroxene porphyroclasts in spinel <b>websterites</b> show deformation twins underlined by orthopyroxene exsolutions. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that garnet clinopyroxenites deformed at 2. 0 GPa and 950 - 1000 °C and spinel pyroxenites at 1. 8 GPa and 1100 - 1150 °C. The lower temperatures may explain the faster work rates implied by the finer grained microstructures in garnet clinopyroxenites. Greater stresses may have also reduced the competence contrast between garnet and pyroxene in the garnet pyroxenites and, at the outcrop scale, lowered the competence contrast between pyroxenites and peridotites, favoring mechanical dispersion of pyroxenites in the cooler lithospheric mantle...|$|R

40|$|Combined field, microtextural, and geochemical {{observations}} are presented for pyroxenites in the Lanzo ultramafic massif {{in order to}} place chemical and petrological constraints both locally on the geologic history of the massif and more generally {{on the role of}} magmatic rifting and the rift-to-drift transition in ultraslow-spreading ridge environments. Two separate generations of pyroxenites have been distinguished. A young set of primitive Cr-diopside <b>websterites</b> of MORB affinity are related to melt infiltrations and melt-rock reactions during rifting and Jurassic exhumation, while a much older generation of <b>websterites</b> likely of subcontinental origin were inherited and pre-date continental rifting and exhumation of the massif. The regional compositional and textural variation observed in the latter group of pyroxenites is not due to primary heterogeneities but rather to differences in subsequent metamorphic histories. Pyroxenites from the northern domain experienced a colder exhumation history and physical isolation {{from the rest of the}} massif by means of a high temperature shear zone related to the rifting. These <b>websterites</b> preserve garnet pseudomorphs and elevated REE which are textural and geochemical evidence for the prior coexistence of clinopyroxene and garnet.

This garnet <b>websterite</b> consists out of large crystals of orthopyroxene + clinopyroxene + garnet + olivine + Cr-spinel and comes from a pod inside an orogenic garnet peridotite body inside a continental gneiss complex. The <b>websterite</b> pod crystallized in original minimal mid-Proterozoic depleted mantle peridotite and got metasomatised during a subsequent Caledonian to Scandian subduction cycle. The subducting slab released COH-rich subduction zone fluids concentrated and along into the slab-mantle interface, responsible for the precipitation of multiphase solid inclusions inside the primary minerals. Previous work on a garnet <b>websterite</b> from the same peridotite body in Bardane indicated the presence of microdiamonds in multiphase solid inclusions giving evidence for UHP (> 130 km) deep subduction. A comparison with this previously studied garnet <b>websterite</b> will be made with an in-situ garnet <b>websterite</b> to confirm the presence of in-situ microdiamonds in multiphase solid inclusions. Back-scattered electron SEM images have identified multiphase solid inclusions with mineral assemblages of phlogopite, BaMg-carbonate, dolomite, magnesite, Cl-apatite, monazite, rutile, Cr-spinel (Cr#= 58 - 91), (Fe,Ni,Cu) sulfides and elemental C inside M 2 orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene crystals. This means introduction of at least the elements C, K, Ti, Ba, Cl, P, Ni, Cu, S, Nb, La, Ce and H 2 O by pervasive subduction zone fluids. Inclusions in M 2 spinel grains (Cr#= 55) contain OH-apatite, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and Al-oxides. Several elemental carbon inclusions in orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene have an euhedral shape similar to those already identified as microdiamonds in the previously studied <b>websterite.</b> The current study unfortunately lacks Raman confirmation to positively identify the carbon inclusions as microdiamonds, but taken {{the similarities between the}} two websterites into account it is very likely that the euhedral shaped carbon inclusions found in this study are microdiamonds or are graphitized microdiamonds. Electron microprobe data confirmed the similarities between the two garnet websterites by elemental wt. % oxide analysis where the chemical compositions of the main M 2 minerals are within 1 wt. % oxide difference from each other. The high occurrence of elemental carbon in the multiphase solid inclusions gives evidence for a reducing character of the subduction zone fluid, although there is also a fair amount of carbonate present in the multiphase assemblages.

To understand the geotectonic significance of these granulites, in particular {{in the context of}} Alpine migmatisation, zircons from 15 high-grade samples have been U-Pb dated by SHRIMP II analysis. Oscillatory zoned zircons from charnockite sheets, interpreted as melts generated through granulite facies fluid-absent biotite melting at 920 - 940 A degrees C, yield ages of 282 - 260 Ma. Some of these zircons contain inclusions of opx, unequivocally attributable to the granulite facies, thus confirming a Permian age for the charnockites and associated granulites. Two samples from an enclave-rich orthogneiss sheet yield Cambrian and Ordovician zircon cores. Two deformed leucogranites and six ortho- and augengneisses, which compose two-thirds of the Gruf Complex, give zircon ages of 290 - 260 Ma. Most zircons have milky rims with ages of 34 - 29 Ma.

40|$|The {{genesis of}} {{primitive}} arc magmas {{has had a}} major impact on continent formation through time, but the rarity of exposures of deep arc sections limits our understanding of the details of melt migration and differentiation. Abundant pyroxenites are exposed within a 600 [*]m thick section of arc-related mantle harzburgites and dunites in the Herbeira massif of the Cabo Ortegal Complex, Spain. We report a combination of field and petrographic observations with in situ and whole-rock geochemical studies of these pyroxenites. After constraining the effects of secondary processes (serpentinization, fluid or melt percolation and amphibolitization), we determine that the low Al content of pyroxenes, high abundance of compatible elements and the absence of plagioclase reflect melt–peridotite interaction and crystal segregation from primitive hydrous melts at relatively low pressure (< 1 · 2 [*]GPa). Olivine clinopyroxenites and olivine <b>websterites</b> preserving dunite lenses (type 1 and 3 pyroxenites) represent the products of partial replacement of peridotites at decreasing melt/rock ratio following the intrusion of picritic melts. Massive <b>websterites</b> (type 2) may represent the final products of this reaction at higher melt/rock ratios. They crystallized from more Si-rich (boninitic) melts, potentially generated through differentiation of the initially picritic melts or intruded as dykes and veins. Rare opx-rich <b>websterites</b> (type 4) were produced by interaction of these melts with dunites. Chromatographic re-equilibration accompanied late-magmatic crystallization of amphibole from migrating or trapped residual melts. This percolative fractional crystallization produced a range of rare earth element (REE) patterns from spoon-shaped in type 1 pyroxenites to strongly light REE (LREE) -enriched in type 2 and 3 pyroxenites. Particularly high CaO/Al₂O₃ ratios (2 · 2 – 11 · 3) and the selective enrichment of large ion lithophile elements (LILE) over high field strength elements (HFSE) in Cabo Ortegal pyroxenites suggest the generation of Ca-rich picritic–boninitic parental melts via low-degree, second-stage melting of a refractory lherzolite at < 2 [*]GPa, following percolation of slab-derived fluids and/or carbonatite melts. Pyroxenites and their host peridotites record high-temperature deformation followed by the development of sheath folds and mylonites. Peak metamorphism was then reached under eclogite-facies conditions (1 · 6 – 1 · 8 [*]GPa and 780 – 800 °C) as recorded by undeformed garnet coronas around spinel. We suggest that this episode corresponds to the delamination of an arc root owing to gravitational instabilities arising from the presence of abundant pyroxenites within mantle harzburgites. Retrograde metamorphism and hydration under amphibolite-facies conditions were recorded by abundant post-kinematic amphibole, which corresponds to the exhumation of the arc root after its intrusion into a subduction zone. The Cabo Ortegal Complex thus preserves a unique section of delaminated arc root, providing evidence for the significant role of melt–peridotite interaction during the differentiation of primitive arc magmas at depth. 34 page(s...|$|R
40|$|A garnet <b>websterite</b> nodule {{from the}} Honolulu {{volcanic}} series, Oahu, Hawaii, has been melted {{in the presence}} of nearly pure H 2 O. The solidus is intermediate between that of peridotite and gabbro. The curve displays a temperature minimum around 20 kb reflecting the breakdown of plagioclase. The liquidus is between 1130 °C and 1150 °C between 10 and 20 kb vapor pressure. Amphibole (pargasitic hornblende) has an extensive stability field, reaching a maximum temperature about 20 °C below the garnet <b>websterite</b> liquidus at 15 kb and a maximum pressure of 27 - 5 kb at 950 °C. The amphibole-out curve intersects the solidus with a positive slope. Liquids formed by partial melting of garnet <b>websterite</b> are quartz-normative within the stability field of amphibole, but become olivine-normative (tholeiitic) with increasing temperature. Amphibole and clinopyroxene are enriched in Tschermak's molecule at higher temperatures, pargasite content of amphibole increases with increasing pressure. A garnet websterite-rich upper mantle containing modal olivine yields quartz-normative (13 - 16 per cent), aluminous (21 - 4 wt. per cent AI 2 O 3) melts at 17 S: P ^ 10 kb and {{in the presence of}} nearly pure H 2 O. However, the presence of amphibole controls the liquid com-position, a situation not found for liquids formed from wet peridotite. In contrast to many basalt liquids, liquid of garnet <b>websterite</b> composition cannot fractionate to andesite by pre-cipitation of amphibole, as amphibole is not a liquidus phase...|$|E
40|$|The Balmuccia alpine lherzolite massif is a {{fragment}} of subcontinental lithospheric mantle emplaced into the lower crust 251 Ma ago during the final, extensional phase of the Hercynian orogeny. The Balmuccia massif consists largely of lherzolite, with subordinate harzburgite and dunite, {{and an array of}} dike rocks formed in the mantle before crustal emplacement. Dike rocks include <b>websterite</b> and bronzitite of the Cr-diopside suite, spinel clinopyroxenite and spinel-poor <b>websterite</b> of the Al-augite suite, gabbro and gabbronorite of the late gabbro suite, and hornblendite of the hydrous vein suite. The dike rocks display consistent intrusive relationships with one another, such that Cr-diopside suite dikes are always older than dikes and veins of the Al-augite suite, followed by dikes of the late gabbro suite and veins of the hydrous vein. suite. Phlogopite phl veinlets that formed during interaction with the adjacent crust are the youngest event. There are at least three generations of Cr-diopside suite dikes, as shown by crosscutting relations. Dikes of the Al-augite suite form a polybaric fractionation series from spinel clinopyroxenite to <b>websterite</b> and feldspathic <b>websterite,</b> which crystallized from aluminous alkaline magmas at relatively high pressures. The late gabbro suite of dikes intruded at lower pressures, where plagioclase saturation occurred before significant mafic phase fractionation. Hornblendite veins have distinct compositional and isotopic characteristics, which show that they are not related to either the Al-augite suite or to the late gabbro dike suite. Cr-diopside suite dikes have Nd and Sr isotopic compositions {{similar to those of the}} host lherzolite and within the range o...|$|E
30|$|Hydrous subducted oceanic {{plates are}} {{eventually}} dehydrated by breakdown of hydrous phases such as serpentine, lawsonite, amphiboles, and micas, {{and as a}} result, H 2 O-rich fluids are released in the deep upper mantle (e.g., Poli and Schmidt 1995). Significant amounts of Na are likely dissolved to aqueous fluids released from hydrous subducted oceanic plates. Such Na-rich aqueous fluids could ascend to overlying mantle peridotites and cause metasomatism of primitive mantle lherzolite and <b>websterite</b> (the host rock of group A garnet in this study) at depths > 200  km. During mantle metasomatism, typical lherzolite and <b>websterite</b> may transform to pyroxenites. Hydrous Na-garnet probably forms in such metasomatized pyroxenites under Na-rich aqueous fluids environments.|$|E
40|$|Mantle xenoliths {{enclosed}} in the Plio-Quaternary alkaline basalts from Bou Ibalrhatene, Middle Atlas, Morocco, {{are characterized by}} {{a wide range of}} lithological and chemical heterogeneity, consistent with metasomatism of their lithospheric mantle source. Subordinate porphyroclastic to protogranular spinel-lherzolites associated with <b>websterites</b> exhibit major and trace element signatures, along with a depleted mantle isotopic affinity, that testify to ancient melt extrac-tion processes, possibly during Neo- to Paleoproterozoic times. These samples show large ion lithophile element (LILE) enrichments that have been imparted a long time after the accretion of their protoliths to the lithosphere, induced by alkaline melts rising from upwelling HIMU-like asthenosphere since the late Cretaceous or Eocene. Extensive sectors of the percolated lherzolite and harzburgite mantle progressively approached chemical equilibrium with the migrating melts, forming porphyroblastic amphibole-rich ultramafic rock...|$|R
40|$|Ultramafic (lherzolites, metasomatized peridotites, harzburgites, <b>websterites</b> and clinopyroxenites) and mafic igneous (basalts, dolerites, diorites and gabbros) rocks exposed at the sea-floor {{along the}} West Iberia {{continental}} margin represent a rare oppor-tunity {{to study the}} transition zone between continental and oceanic lithosphere. The igneous rocks are enriched in LREE, unlike North Atlantic MORB. A correlation between their 143 Nd/ 144 Nd iso-topic composition and Ce/Yb ratio suggests that they originate from mixing between partial melts of a depleted mantle source similar to DMM and of an enriched mantle source which may reside within the continental lithosphere. Clinopyroxenes and amphiboles in the ultramafic rocks are LREE depleted and have flat HREE patterns with concentrations {{higher than those of}} abyssal peridotites.

40|$|The Finero Phlogopite Peridotite unit (hereafter Ph-Pd, Ivrea-Verbano Zone, IVZ: Southern Alps) is {{the unique}} {{worldwide}} example of orogenic mantle massif completely constituted by phlogopite-bearing ultramafics (mainly harzburgites, <b>websterites</b> and dunites) after pervasive to channelled melt migration events. A precious opportunity to provide further {{constraints on the}} petrologic and geodynamic evolution of such a mantle sequence is given by the occurrence of zircons in chromitites usually composed by Chromite+Orthopyroxene±Clinopyroxene±Amphibole. Zircons show low CL emission and are generally homogeneous. Few grains display cores slightly darker than the rims. Zircons have up to 1420 and 800 ppm of U and Th, respectively, with Th/U ratio up to 1. 6. U-Pb LA-ICP-HRMS analyses yield most concordant Lower Jurassic dates with a weighted average 206 Pb/ 238 U age at 187 ± 2 Ma. A few darker cores yield Middle Triassic concordant 206 Pb/ 238 U ages from 242 ± 7 Ma to 229 ± 7 Ma. Zircons also show 176 Hf/ 177 Hf ratios {{in the range of}} 0. 282486 - 0. 282610, which give subchondrititic epsilon Hf(188) (- 6. 0 to - 1. 6). The relatively high U and Th contents and the large Th/U ratios are the evidence that the chromitite zircons crystallised from a melt, which, according to the low epsilon Hf(188) values, had a marked crustal signature. This melt is analogous to that at the origin of the phlogopite harzburgites and <b>websterites.</b> The absence of internal zoning in zircon is interpreted as the result of homogenisation after a prolonged residence at high temperature mantle conditions. In this frame, the Lower Jurassic ages are proposed to date the cooling of the mantle sequence during exhumation for the opening of the Alpine Tethys. Conversely, the few Middle Triassic dates could represent the age of mantle metasomatism. As a whole, our data strongly support that the Finero area experienced a different geodynamic evolution with respect to the rest of IVZ...|$|R
