5|$|Kan'ami Kiyotsugu {{and his son}} Zeami Motokiyo brought Noh to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> its present-day form {{during the}} Muromachi period (1336 to 1573). Kan'ami was a renowned actor with great {{versatility}} fulfilling roles from graceful women and 12-year-old boys to strong adult males. When Kan'ami first presented his work to 17-year-old Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Zeami was a child actor in his play, around age 12. Yoshimitsu {{fell in love with}} Zeami and his position of favor at court caused Noh to be performed frequently for Yoshimitsu thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Fare is payable by MetroCard. Since {{this card}} enables free {{transfers}} for a continuing {{ride on the}} subway and bus systems, for many more riders there is effectively no fare at all for riding SIR. Riders are also allowed to transfer between a Staten Island bus, SIR, and a Manhattan bus or subway near South Ferry. Because of this, the SIR's farebox recovery ratio in 2001 was 0.16that is, for every dollar of expense, 16 cents was recovered in fares, the lowest ratio of MTA agencies. The low farebox recovery ratio {{is part of the}} reason the MTA wishes to merge the SIR with the subway proper which will simplify the accounting and subsidization of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> a single line.|$|E

5|$|Mother Gothel {{appears in}} Tangled (2010). For {{hundreds}} of years, Gothel, a vain old woman, hoards the rejuvenation powers of a magical flower {{in order to}} remain young and beautiful, while selfishly keeping the flower's whereabouts a secret {{from the rest of the}} kingdom. However, when the pregnant Queen of Corona falls fatally ill, the flower is desperately retrieved and fed to her, healing her and in turn inadvertently stripping Gothel of her access to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> the only thing that is keeping her alive. Meanwhile, the King and Queen's newborn daughter Rapunzel is gifted with the flower's abilities, which manifest via her long, golden hair when a special song is sung so long as it remains uncut. Desperate to stay alive, Gothel steals the baby from the palace and she imprisoned her in a secluded tower for eighteen years, raising the child as her own and prohibiting her from leaving solely in order to use her hair to stay young.|$|E

25|$|The middle Ohio River {{formed in}} a manner similar to {{formation}} of the upper Ohio River. A north-flowing river was temporarily dammed southwest of present-day Louisville, creating a large lake until the dam burst. A new route was carved to the Mississippi.

25|$|The {{university}} can {{be considered}} {{the birthplace of the}} computer, with mathematician Charles Babbage having designed the world's first computing system as early as the mid-1800s. Alan Turing went on to devise <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> the basis for modern computing and Maurice Wilkes later created the first programmable computer. The webcam was also invented at Cambridge University, as a means for scientists to avoid interrupting their research and going {{all the way down to}} the laboratory dining room only to be disappointed by an empty coffee pot.|$|E
25|$|This section {{has been}} {{interpreted}} to mean that for the entire passage of the poem, Aeneas who symbolizes pietas (reason) in a moment becomes furor (fury), thus destroying <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> the primary theme of the poem itself.

Some claim that Virgil meant to change them before he died, while others find that {{the location of the}} two passages, {{at the very end of}} the so-called Volume I (Books 1–6, the Odyssey), and Volume II (Books 7–12, the Iliad), and their short length, which contrasts with the lengthy nature of the poem, are evidence that Virgil placed them purposefully there.|$|E

25|$|Spastic {{cerebral}} palsy, or {{cerebral palsy}} where spasticity (muscle tightness) is the exclusive or almost exclusive impairment present, {{is by far}} the most common type of overall cerebral palsy, occurring in upwards of 70% of all cases. People with this type of CP are hypertonic and have <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> a neuromuscular mobility impairment (rather than hypotonia or paralysis) stemming from an upper motor neuron lesion in the brain as well as the corticospinal tract or the motor cortex. This damage impairs the ability of some nerve receptors in the spine to receive gamma-Aminobutyric acid properly, leading to hypertonia in the muscles signaled by those damaged nerves.|$|E
25|$|On the right, or south, is the pulpit, reader’s desk, and clerk’s desk, the reader’s desk {{supposedly}} {{made from}} {{portions of the}} original pulpit. The reader’s desk stands {{just in front of}} (north) of the main pulpit. All of this stands to {{the west side of the}} south window on a raised platform but, unlike the chancel, has no separating rail. Between the chancel and the raised area for the pulpit is a small organ enclosed by vertical panels. Behind the organ are two choir pews facing north. (This is a crowded church with very narrow aisles.) In front of the clerk’s desk is the baptismal font. To the west of the raised pulpit are two rows of three slip pews with a central aisle. The rest of the ground level of the church is taken up by rows of slip pews facing south in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> a nave area.|$|E
25|$|This enigmatic {{structure}} stands erect around 12.5 meters tall (~ 35 feet), with a linear, cubical {{shape and}} a square base (~ 22 feet in sides), constructed in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>essentially</b> a dug out rectangular depression, having on {{all but one}} of its sides, four rectangular depressions resembling blind windows, and multiple minute rectangular depressions in the façade interdispersed among the blind windows as well as the side housing the staircase. The staircase leads to a small door (5 feet by 6 feet in dimensions) opening to an interior apartment of about 12 feet square. The structure's roof houses a minimal entablature of a repeating square pattern. The entire structure is posited on a raised stone platform that is composed of a few stone slabs, in a sequentially smaller yet in a concentric, pyramidally shaped succession. This structure is enigmatic, both in its aesthetic choice seen in its rather odd design, and façade, as well as its location, and supposed function.|$|E
