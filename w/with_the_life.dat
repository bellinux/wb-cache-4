5|$|Hindley's {{first job}} {{was as a}} junior clerk at a local {{electrical}} engineering firm. She ran errands, made tea, and typed. She was well liked at the firm, enough so that when she lost her first week's wage packet, the other girls had a collection to replace it. Beginning at Christmas 1958, Hindley began a short relationship with Ronnie Sinclair, and became engaged at 17. The engagement was called off several months later; Hindley apparently thought Sinclair immature, and unable to provide her <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> she envisaged for herself.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after 20:00, the III Flotilla of torpedo boats {{attempted}} to rescue Wiesbadens crew, but heavy {{fire from the}} British battle line drove them off. Another attempt to reach the ship was made, but the torpedo boat crews {{lost sight of the}} cruiser and were unable to locate her. The ship finally sank sometime between 01:45 and 02:45. Only one crew member survived the sinking; he was picked up by a Norwegian steamer the following day. Among the 589 killed was the well-known writer of poetry and fiction dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> of fishermen and sailors, Johann Kinau, known under his pseudonym of Gorch Fock, who has since then been honored by having two training windjammers of the Kriegsmarine and the German Navy, respectively, named after him. The wreck of Wiesbaden was found in 1983 by divers of the German Navy, who removed both of the ship's screws. The ship lies on the sea floor upside down, and was the last German cruiser sunk at Jutland to be located.|$|E
5|$|The Hajj is {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> of Islamic prophet Muhammad from the 7th century, but {{the ritual of}} pilgrimage to Mecca is considered by Muslims to stretch back thousands of years {{to the time of}} Abraham. During Hajj, pilgrims join processions {{of hundreds of thousands of}} people, who simultaneously converge on Mecca for the week of the Hajj, and perform a series of rituals: each person walks counter-clockwise seven times around the Kaaba (the cube-shaped building and the direction of prayer for the Muslims), runs back and forth between the hills of Safa and Marwah, drinks from the Zamzam Well, goes to the plains of Mount Arafat to stand in vigil, spends a night in the plain of Muzdalifa, and performs symbolic stoning of the devil by throwing stones at three pillars. The pilgrims then shave their heads, perform a ritual of animal sacrifice, and celebrate the three-day global festival of Eid al-Adha.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Kingdom saw {{the decline}} of the {{official}} cult of Nyuserre. Evidence from this period come from works undertaken in the Karnak temple by Senusret I, who dedicated a number of statues of Old Kingdom kings including at least one of Nyuserre, to a cult of Amun and of the royal ancestors. At the same time, the 12th Dynasty saw the widespread dismantling of many Old Kingdom funerary temples for their materials, which were notably reused in the pyramid complexes of Amenemhat I and Senusret I. These events are contemporaneous <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> of the last priest serving the official cult of Nyuserre, a certain Inhotep. Both of these facts hint at a lapse of royal interest in the state-sponsored funerary cults of Old Kingdom rulers.|$|E

Onassis's mother arrived from Switzerland with her husband, Stavros Niarchos. Aristotle had also flown the English neurosurgeon Alan Richardson from London to Athens, but Richardson later told Onassis that Alexander had no chance of surviving his injuries. Aristotle Onassis considered having his son's body cryogenically frozen <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Life</b> Extension Society, but was persuaded against it, and it was embalmed by Desmond Henley.

5|$|A typical P. exclamans worker {{will live}} somewhere between 14–16 days. The oldest wasp to be {{observed}} in a natural colony was 102 days old. Queens typically live 6 times longer than the workers. There has been some variation observed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> expectancy of P. exclamans. This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin. It also {{must be noted that}} while there is variation between colonies, there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest. Variation inside a single colony may also occur {{because of the presence of}} different castes. Foragers, those who frequently travel outside the nest, lead a riskier life and tend to have lower life expectancy than those who stay in the nest. Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life expectancy. Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity. This was because the females were more focused on competing to become the next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles.|$|E
5|$|In this installment, Link gains {{experience}} {{points to}} upgrade his attack, magic, and life by defeating enemies. This feature is exclusive to Zelda II {{in the game}} series. He can raise each of these attributes {{to a maximum of}} eight levels. Raising a life level will decrease the damage Link receives when hit, raising a magic level will decrease the magic points (MP) cost of spells, and raising an attack level will strengthen his sword's offensive power. Each attribute requires a different amount of experience to level up, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> level requiring the least number of points to level and attack requiring the most. When enough points are acquired to raise an attribute, the player may choose to level up that attribute or to cancel and continue gaining experience points towards the next level in another attribute. Once Link has raised an attribute to the maximum level of eight, further advances in that attribute will earn Link an extra life, without advancing the attribute itself. Link begins the game with four Heart Containers and four Magic Containers and can acquire up to four more of each, permanently increasing his life points and magic points respectively. Other games in The Legend of Zelda series only allow Link to increase his strength through new weapons, items, and Heart Containers. Certain enemies drain Link's experience when they attack, but he will never lose a level once raised. When a game ends or is saved, the cartridge records Link's current ability levels and the number of experience points required for the next increase, but resets his accumulated points to zero.|$|E

5|$|Literary critic Todd Garth {{argues that}} I, the Supreme is {{influenced}} by twentieth-century Argentine writer Macedonio Fernández, {{as well as other}} avant garde artists such as Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortázar. Garth suggests that Macedonio and Roa Bastos are similar in use of metaphysical language and techniques used to reconstruct reality, as Dr. Francia does in his dictated creation of the Supreme, the ruler of all reality. Macedonio's writing utilized characters that did not fit the archetype of Western fiction, each only having meaning through their interaction with others in a collective and often never experiencing growth or development in order to construct atemporal spaces of mythmaking that challenge reality. Roa Bastos borrows from these ideas yet situates them in existing political and social history to challenge perceived conceptions of the past's factuality. He dismantles national Paraguayan mythology which is so intimately intertwined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> of Dr. Francia, elucidating the distinctions between mythic and mythological. The novel can only accomplish this task within the metaphysical space of mythmaking. Whereas Macedonio attacks the concept of the individual as subject while admitting the fact that to write makes oneself a subject, Roa Bastos recognizes this paradox and exploits it, utilizing it in concerns of political and social nature.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} about Henrik Ibsen?s The Lady from the Sea. In this study, {{the writer is}} going to discuss Ellida Wangel?s coping <b>with</b> <b>the</b> land <b>life.</b> <b>The</b> writer {{considers}} this topic significant since she discovers that Ellida?s homeland has left its mark so deeply in her mind, that she finds it difficult to acclimatize herself to her new environment. Through this study, the writer is challenged to analyze Ellida?s coping <b>with</b> <b>the</b> land <b>life</b> {{to find out why}} Ellida is unable to cope <b>with</b> her <b>life</b> on <b>the</b> land as well as how finally she succeeds in coping <b>with</b> <b>the</b> land <b>life.</b> By applying literary theories on characterization, conflict, and setting, the writer discovers that Ellida is unable to cope <b>with</b> her <b>life</b> on <b>the</b> land because she is intensely attached to the sea. Besides that, her inharmonious relationships with her husband and stepdaughters as well as the people in the town also take part in creating her inability to cope <b>with</b> <b>the</b> land <b>life.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> writer also learns that in order to survive on the land, Ellida attempts to escape from her reality through her fantasy. By studying Ellida?s coping <b>with</b> <b>the</b> land <b>life,</b> <b>the</b> writer concludes {{that it is hard to}} acclimatize oneself to a new environment, and yet feeling of being needed and loved may assist one to acclimatize oneself to the new environment...|$|R
