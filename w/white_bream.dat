The preliminary experiment consisted of determining the concentration of riboflavin added to T. suecica cultures to achieve a maximum quantity of this vitamin in the microalgal cells. Seven concentrations were tested in triplicate: 0 (control), 2. 5, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 ng ml− 1; {{the results showed that}} the 10 ng ml− 1 was the optimum concentration that the microalgae accumulated 4. 29 ± 0. 19 pg cell− 1, 21. 2 ± 0. 35 ng ml− 1 and 19. 4 ± 0. 56 μg g− 1 (dry weight) of riboflavin.

Migration patterns were investigated from October to June, and {{a substantial part of}} the roach (40 %) and <b>white</b> <b>bream</b> (55 %) populations tagged in the lake during autumn migrated during winter into the streams, whereas only very few piscivores (< 2 %) migrated. In contrast to roach and <b>white</b> <b>bream,</b> only few rudd (< 6 %) migrated, which is likely a consequence of different overwintering strategies, e. g., rudd overwintering in shallow highly structured habitats. Small rudd migrated more than larger rudd, whereas there were no size-differentiated migration patterns for roach or <b>white</b> <b>bream.</b> Migration of the cyprinid fishes was generally initiated in late October and ended in May, and specific synchronised bursts of migration were observed in December, January and April, suggesting that migration is triggered by one or more proximate environmental cues.

40|$|Biological invasions {{are deemed}} {{as one of}} the most severe threats to {{biodiversity}} and can result in huge economic impacts on natural resources. Many studies have assessed structural changes caused by the introduction of nonindigenous species, but urgent questions remain to be answered about the complex indirect effects of invasive pests on marine biodiversity at the species and ecosystem level. Previous investigations focusing on the biological invasion by Caulerpa racemosa in the Mediterranean indicated that the lipophilic algal metabolite caulerpin accumulates in the tissues of the native edible <b>white</b> sea <b>bream</b> Diplodus sargus feeding on the exotic alga. The level of caulerpin in D. sargus has been thus used as an indicator of the trophic exposure of the fish to the seaweed and related with adverse effects on the fish health. In the present study, we show that the C. racemosa-based diet can also alter muscle fatty acids composition in the <b>white</b> sea <b>bream</b> by reducing the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids of the n- 3 and n- 6 series, such as eicosapentaenoic (C 20 : 5), docosahexaenoic (C 22 : 6) and arachidonic acids (C 20 : 4). This represents both a real threat to the health of fish unable to biosynthesize these essential fatty acids and an impoverishment of an important source of essential fatty acids for human nutrition, which helps to prevent cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hepatic steatosis, cancer and neurological disorders.

40|$|Previous {{research}} shows that the reducible-channel model of filter-feeding can probably be applied to common bream, but not to <b>white</b> <b>bream.</b> According to this model, zooplankton are retained in the channels between the medial gill rakers; the mesh size of the sieve can be reduced by lowering the lateral rakers of the neighbouring gill arch into these channels. Gill arch movements may well disturb this mechanism; the depressed lateral gill rakers will move {{in and out of the}} medial channels and also shift out of their centre. We have quantified these disturbances by measuring the gill arch movements during filter-feeding in <b>white</b> <b>bream</b> and common bream, using dorsal X-ray films. In both species, the lateral rakers are long enough to bridge the gill slits. It was expected that common bream, which can reduce their channels, would have considerably less shift out of the channel centre than <b>white</b> <b>bream,</b> which cannot reduce their channels. However, the predicted shift is 40 – 50 % of the channel width in <b>white</b> <b>bream</b> and 75 % in common bream. A new, dynamic retention mechanism is proposed for common bream. According to this hypothesis, once a particle is trapped in a reduced channel, the channel walls release mucus and the particle becomes sticky. Hence, particles need to be retained mechanically only during part of the gulping cycle. According to the hypothesis, this is achieved by sideways rotation of the lateral rakers in combination with their tapering shape. Retention mechanisms with interdigitating rakers are expected chiefly in facultative filter-feeders, because such mechanisms are easily disturbed by gill arch movements...|$|E

Changes in the chemical composition of meat of all examined species had the same tendencies. Water and protein content in the meat decreased, while fat content increased. The most frequent fatty acids in the meat of all the examined fish were the following: 18 : 1 n- 9 (oleic), 16 : 0 (palmitic), 16 : 1 (palmitoleic), 18 : 2 n- 6 (linoleic), 20 : 1 (eicosenoic), 20 : 5 n- 3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), 20 : 4 n- 6 arachidonic acid and 22 : 6 n- 3 docosahexaeonic acid (DHA). The content of saturated fatty acids (SFA) ranged from 25. 03 % to 32. 43 % and displayed a tendency to increase during the observed period. The total content of the n- 6 group in the meat of Prussian carp was higher than in other species, which was probably a consequence of specific diet. The total content of n- 3 fatty acids in the meat of <b>white</b> <b>bream,</b> bream, vimba and zope was the highest in May, and it declined during July-September. We can conclude that the meat of <b>white</b> <b>bream</b> and vimba contains high nutritional values in terms of EPA and DHA content.

40|$|Aim: To {{explore the}} {{patterns}} of connectivity between marine protected areas (MPAs) and neighbouring non-protected areas and the scale at which the benefits of MPAs are expected using the <b>white</b> sea <b>bream</b> as model species. Location: Marine protected area of Torre Guaceto (TGMPA, Italy) in the south Adriatic Sea. Methods: A multidisciplinary approach was used combining (1) a genetic survey using 12 highly informative microsatellite loci of samples collected within the MPA and in several locations up to 100 km from the MPA; and (2) larval trajectories using Lagrangian simulations based on an oceanographical model of the region that includes specific data on early life-history traits. Both genetic and simulation studies were temporarily replicated during two consecutive years. Results: The overall genetic homogeneity observed indicates that the TGMPA is not isolated {{and that there is}} genetic connectivity among locations across a scale of at least ~ 200 km. A high degree of connectivity between the TGMPA and neighbouring areas is in agreement with Lagrangian simulations, which indicate that <b>white</b> sea <b>bream</b> larvae can be transported over large distances up to about 300 km. Trajectories released from the TGMPA showed that on average, 12. 75 % of the larvae remains within the TGMPA, while the rest travel south towards non-protected areas. Main conclusions: Our findings highlight the potential benefits of effectively enforced MPAs for neighbouring or relatively distant non-protected fishing areas and the potential connection with other MPAs at regional scale. Combining genetics and modelling can provide a general framework to investigate the role of connectivity in MPA design that can be easily extended to other species and geographical areas...|$|R

In filter-feeding experiments with common bream (Abramis brama), the smallest retained copepods correspondingly were about 35 % less wide than the smallest retained Daphnia. <b>White</b> <b>bream</b> (Blicca bjoerkna) did not retain copepods smaller than Daphnia.

We calculated that zooplankton depth is the critical size parameter in reduced channels and zooplankton width in unreduced channels. We found that <b>white</b> <b>bream</b> was feeding with unreduced channels and common bream with reduced channels. The depth/width ratio (35 % lower in Daphnia than in copepods) therefore explains the difference in retention of copepods and Daphnia by common bream whereas no such difference was expected for <b>white</b> <b>bream.</b> The shape of zooplankton thus affects the trophic segregation and the exploitation of food resources by fish...|$|E
