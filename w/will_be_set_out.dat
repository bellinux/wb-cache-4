For from these beginnings she was destined to proceed to more and more knowledge and understanding and clear purpose and capable work in this interesting process of collective regrouping, this process which may even at last justify Mr. Brumley's courageous interpretations and prove to be an early experiment in {{the beginning of a new}} social order. Perhaps some day there will be an official biography, another addition to the inscrutable records of British public lives, in which all these things <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> with tact and dignity. Horatio Blenker or Adolphus Blenker may survive to be entrusted with this congenial task. She will be represented as a tall inanimate person pursuing one clear benevolent purpose in life from her very beginning, and Sir Isaac and her relations with Sir Isaac will be rescued from reality. The book will be illustrated by a number of carefully posed photographer's photographs of her, studies of the Putney house and perhaps an unappetizing woodcut of her early home at Penge. The aim of all British biography is to conceal. A great deal of what we have already told will certainly not figure in any such biography, and still more certainly will the things we have yet to tell be missing.|$|E

The Employment of Women Act 1907 repealed an exemption in the act of 1901 (and earlier acts) relating to employment of women in flax scutch mills, thus bringing this employment under the ordinary provisions as to period of employment.|$|E

Both cases dealt with the issue of whether the mineral rights/mining rights of private holders were expropriated by legislation which prohibited mining in one way or another.

40|$|This {{study will}} examine the issues of {{responsibility}} and accountability in Canada’s system of responsible parliamentary government, with a particular emphasis on the role Deputy Ministers play in the Government of Canada.

The study will begin with {{a review of the}} fundamental principles underlying responsible parliamentary government in Canada. Although 115 these principles have remained constant for over 150 years, the nature of government in Canada has evolved and a number of those changes— and their implications for responsible government—will be noted.

40|$|Excerpt] What we <b>will</b> do here <b>is</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> {{some models}} of disease, and then {{apply them to}} some {{clinical}} problems {{to see how the}} models shape up. The models of disease we discuss are not all mutually exclusive, but different ways of viewing the clinical problems we encounter. The models include: *Cause and effect models, and their several variants; *‘edge of the distribution’ illnesses (also known as ‘spectrum disorders’); *Spontaneously remitting and self-perpetuating illnesses; and *‘alternative’ medicine models. These are all ‘transparent box’ approaches to disease: that is, a model of how the disease works, which in turn should suggest how we might treat it. But we can also take a ‘black box’ or empirical approach, which recognises a pattern of illness, and base treatment on what has worked with similar patterns in the past. These approaches are complementary. The models can also mislead us, and so we will also discuss the important topic of ‘non-disease’, that is, conditions that now or in the past have been given the label of a ‘disease’ but where the condition is a harmless variant of normal, or a misunderstanding of causation...|$|R

40|$|Involving the {{collaboration}} of researchers from Classics, Geography and Archaeological Computing, {{and supported by}} funding from the AHRC, HESTIA (the Herodotus Encoded Space-Text-Imaging Archive) aims to enrich contemporary discussions of space by developing an innovative methodology {{for the study of}} an ancient narrative, Herodotus’s Histories. Using the latest digital technology in combination with close textual study, we investigate the geographical concepts through which Herodotus describes the conflict between Greeks and Persians. Our findings nuance the customary topographical vision of an east versus west polarity by drawing attention to the topological network culture that criss-crosses the two, and develop the means of bringing that world to a mass audience via the internet. In this paper we discuss three main aspects to the project: the data capture of place-names in Herodotus; their visualization and dissemination using the web-mapping technologies of GIS, Google Earth and Timemap; and the interrogation of the relationships that Herodotus draws between different geographical concepts using the digital resources at our disposal.

40|$|This report <b>sets</b> <b>out</b> a {{framework}} and terminology for classifying and naming lithodemic units composed entirely or predominantly of intrusive rock. It {{has been written}} with the geology of the UK in mind, but the principles and definitions recommended here should be applicable globally. The report anticipates a second phase of work, in which a BGS lithodemic classification for onshore intrusions in the UK <b>will</b> <b>be</b> constructed using the recommendations <b>set</b> <b>out</b> here. It <b>is</b> expected that this classification <b>will</b> in future <b>be</b> extended to include other classes of lithodemic unit (highly deformed, highly metamorphosed and ‘mixed’), and lithodemic units in offshore parts of the UK. A hierarchical framework of six formal ranks is proposed. Recommendations are made for classifying lithodemic units within the hierarchy and for constructing formal names for lithodemic units. A comprehensive glossary contains definitions for ‘approved’ lithodemic terms and for other terms associated with lithodemic classification. Some amendments to the existing form for making entries to the BGS Lexicon of Named Rock Units are suggested {{in order to make}} it compatible with some of the special characteristics of lithodemic units. It is proposed that a Lithodemic Framework Committee be established to approve new names for lithodemic units and to oversee management and development of the classification. Examples showing how the proposed classification and nomenclature <b>will</b> work <b>are</b> <b>set</b> <b>out</b> in an Appendix, generally in the form of simplified geological maps accompanied by a ‘classification’ of the illustrated lithodemic units in a hierarchical chain.
