40|$|A {{feeding trial}} was {{conducted}} in adult albino rats to study the influence on lipid fractions of serum and various body tissues by feeding diets containing sarsoon oil, canola oil and hydrogenated fat. The results revealed that serum cholesterol decreased in sarsoon (- 14. 3 %) and canola oil (- 9. 9 %) <b>while</b> <b>increased</b> in hydrogenated fat (26. 1 %) fed rats.

Liver cholesterol showed higher (P< 0. 05) values in sarsoon oil (426. 33 ± 25. 03 mg/ 100 g) fed rats. Rapeseed oils showed lower (P< 0. 01) carcass triglycerides than hydrogenated fat fed rats.

5|$|According to Caltrain, the {{electrification}} {{project will}} bring multiple {{benefits to the}} corridor. Firstly, electric trains can accelerate and decelerate more quickly than the existing diesel locomotives, resulting in faster and more frequent service. They will also replace Caltrain's current diesel locomotives and passenger cars, {{a significant portion of}} which are nearing the end of their lives. Additionally, electric trainsets are quieter and produce less air pollution that diesel locomotives, and the use of electric trains will lower Caltrain's fuel costs <b>while</b> <b>increasing</b> passenger revenue, due to an expected increase in ridership. Once complete, Caltrain expects to annually reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 176,000 metric tons and increase daily ridership by 21% by 2040. Daily service may be restored to Atherton and Broadway stations. Caltrain plans to complete the project by the end of 2021.|$|E
5|$|Dwindling party {{membership}} created {{many problems}} for Quisling, especially financial ones. For {{years he had}} been in financial difficulties and reliant on his inheritance, <b>while</b> <b>increasing</b> numbers of his paintings were found to be copies when he tried to sell them. Vidkun and his brother Arne sold one Frans Hals painting for just four thousand dollars, believing it to be a copy and not the fifty-thousand-dollar artwork they had once thought it to be, only to see it reclassified as an original and revalued at a hundred thousand dollars. In the difficult circumstances of the Great Depression, even originals did not raise as much as Quisling had hoped. His disillusionment with Norwegian society was furthered by news of the planned constitutional reform of 1938, which would extend the parliamentary term from three to four years with immediate effect, a move Quisling bitterly opposed.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Katanga secession, {{political}} negotiations {{began to}} reconcile the disparate political factions. The negotiations coincided with the formation of an émigré political group, the Conseil National de Libération (CNL), by dissident Lumumbists and others in neighbouring Congo-Brazzaville. The negotiations culminated {{in the creation of a}} new, revised constitution, known as the Luluabourg Constitution, after the city in which it was written, to create a compromise balance of power. The new constitution increased the power of the presidency, ending the system of joint consultation between President and Prime Minister, and appeased federalists by increasing the number of provinces from six to 21 <b>while</b> <b>increasing</b> their autonomy. The constitution also changed the name of the state from the Republic of the Congo to Democratic Republic of the Congo. The constitution was passed in a constitutional referendum in June 1964 and Parliament was dissolved to await new elections. Kasa-Vubu appointed Tshombe, the exiled Katangese leader, as interim Prime Minister. Although personally capable, and supported as an anti-communist by Western powers, Tshombe was denounced by other African leaders such as King Hassan II of Morocco as an imperialist puppet for his role in the Katangese secession.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{the human}} {{forecaster}} {{was responsible for}} generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations. Today, human input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters, such as model biases and performance. Using a consensus of forecast models, as well as ensemble members of the various models, can help reduce forecast error. However, regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system, large errors within any particular piece of guidance are still possible on any given model run. Humans are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the end user. Humans can use knowledge of local effects that may be too small in size to be resolved by the model to add information to the forecast. <b>While</b> <b>increasing</b> accuracy of forecast models implies that humans {{may no longer be}} needed in the forecast process {{at some point in the}} future, there is currently still a need for human intervention.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{worked with}} Republicans {{to shift the}} source of federal funds from taxes to tariffs. He {{believed}} the taxation of alcohol spread the burdens of taxation unfairly, especially as concerned his constituents, who included several distillers. He also believed the income tax, first enacted during the Civil War, was being administered unfairly, with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests. On this point, Randall was successful, and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $500 to be tried before a federal district court. He also worked toward the elimination of taxation on tea, coffee, cigars, and matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from taxation made these items cheaper for the average American, <b>while</b> <b>increasing</b> reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall's district, as it made foreign products more expensive.|$|E

5|$|The British {{government}} had traditionally {{paid little attention}} to the poor, but {{in the wake of the}} Industrial Revolution attitudes towards the accomplishments of the lower classes were changing. The growth of the railways, the mechanisation of agriculture and the need for labour in the new inner-city factories had broken the traditional feudal economy and caused the rapid growth of cities, <b>while</b> <b>increasing</b> literacy rates led to a greater interest in the media and current affairs among ordinary workers. In 1856 the first military honour for bravery open to all ranks, the Victoria Cross, had been instituted, while in 1866 the Albert Medal, the first official honour open to civilians of all classes, was introduced. Additionally, a number of private and charitable organisations dedicated to lifesaving, most prominently the Royal Humane Society (1776) and Royal National Lifeboat Institution (1824), were increasing in activity and prominence, and gave awards and medals as a means of publicising their activities and lifesaving advice.|$|E
5|$|The {{characteristics}} of the resulting star depend primarily upon its starting mass. The more massive the star, the greater its luminosity, and the more rapidly it fuses its hydrogen fuel into helium in its core. Over time, this hydrogen fuel is completely converted into helium, and the star begins to evolve. The fusion of helium requires a higher core temperature. A star with a high enough core temperature will push its outer layers outward <b>while</b> <b>increasing</b> its core density. The resulting red giant formed by the expanding outer layers enjoys a brief life span, before the helium fuel in the core is in turn consumed. Very massive stars can also undergo a series of evolutionary phases, as they fuse increasingly heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{remained as}} {{a unit of the}} Oklahoma National Guard, and participated in no major actions {{throughout the rest of the}} 1950s save regular weekend and summer training exercises. In 1963, the formation was reorganized in accordance with the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions plan, which saw the establishment of a 1st, 2nd and 3rd Brigade within the division. These brigades would see no major deployments or events, and were deactivated five years later in 1968. That same year, due to the perceived lack of need for so many large formations in the Army National Guard, the 45th Infantry Division was deactivated, as part of a larger move to reduce the number of Army National Guard divisions from 15 to eight, <b>while</b> <b>increasing</b> the number of separate brigades from seven to 18. In its place, the independent 45th Infantry Brigade (Separate) was established. The 45th Infantry Brigade received all of the 45th Division's lineage and heraldry, including its shoulder sleeve insignia. Also activated from division assets were the 45th Field Artillery Group, later redesignated the 45th Fires Brigade, and the 90th Troop Command.|$|E
