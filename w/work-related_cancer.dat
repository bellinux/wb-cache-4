40|$|Abstract Background In most countries, {{the numbers}} of <b>work-related</b> <b>cancer</b> {{identified}} are much lower than are the estimated total burden of cancer caused by exposure at work. Therefore, {{there is a great}} need to use all available practical as well as epidemiological methods for identification as well as to develop new methods of recognizing cases of work-related cancers. Methods Primarily based on practical experiences from Norway, methods to identify cases of possible work-related cancers in the general population and at workplaces as well as methods to recognize more specific cases after referral to specialized clinics are reviewed in this publication. Results Countries applying a number of the available methods to detect <b>work-related</b> <b>cancer</b> reach a reporting rate of 60 such cases per million, while other countries that do not employ such methods hardly identify any cases. As most subjects previously exposed to cancer causing agents and substances at work are gradually recruited out of work, methods should be versatile for identification of cases in the general population, as well as at work. Conclusions Even in countries using a number of the available methods for identification, only a limited fraction of the real number of <b>work-related</b> <b>cancer</b> are notified to the labour inspectorate. Clinicians should be familiar with the methods and do the best to identify <b>work-related</b> <b>cancer</b> to serve prevention. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere {{is still}} a {{considerable}} burden of occupational diseases and injuries in the world. It is not well known which interventions can effectively reduce the exposures at work that cause this burden. The objective {{of this article is}} to summarize evidence from systematic reviews of interventions to prevent occupational diseases and injuries. We included systematic reviews of interventions to reduce the incidence of <b>work-related</b> <b>cancer,</b> dust-related diseases, occupational asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, noiseinduced hearing loss, back pain, and occupational injuries. We searched Medline and Embase with predefined search strategies to locate systematic reviews of these interventions. We found 23 systematic reviews of which the results are also applicable to low- and middle income countries. Effective measures to reduce exposure leading to <b>work-related</b> <b>cancer,</b> dust-related diseases, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, noise, and injuries are available. However, better implementation of these measures is needed. Regulation, enforcement of regulation, and incentives for employers are effective interventions to achieve this goal. There is evidence that feedback and rewards for workers help in reducing occupational injuries. There is no evidence in many studies that back pain can be prevented. Personal protective equipment technically has the potential to reduce exposure but this is difficult to put into effect. There is no evidence in the studies regarding the effectiveness of education and training, preventive drugs, or health examinations. There is evidence that the implementation of technical measures enforced by regulation can prevent occupational diseases and injuries. For other interventions such as education or health examinations, there is no evidence that supports their effectiveness. More systematic reviews are needed in the area of injury prevention...|$|E
40|$|This study {{estimates}} the annual numbers of eight <b>work-related</b> <b>cancers,</b> total losses of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime healthcare expenditures that possibly {{could be saved}} by improving occupational health in Taiwan. Three databases were interlinked: the Taiwan Cancer Registry, the National Mortality Registry, and the National Health Insurance Research Database. Annual numbers of <b>work-related</b> <b>cancers</b> were estimated based on attributable fractions (AFs) abstracted from a literature review. The survival functions for eight cancers were estimated and extrapolated to lifetime using a semi-parametric method. A convenience sample of 8846 measurements of patients' quality of life with EQ- 5 D was collected for utility values and multiplied by survival functions to estimate quality-adjusted life expectancies (QALEs). The loss-of-QALE was obtained by subtracting the QALE of cancer from age- and sex-matched referents simulated from national vital statistics. The lifetime healthcare expenditures were estimated by multiplying the survival probability with mean monthly costs paid by the National Health Insurance for cancer diagnosis and treatment and summing this for the expected lifetime. A total of 3010 males and 726 females with eight <b>work-related</b> <b>cancers</b> were estimated in 2010. Among them, lung cancer ranked first in terms of QALY loss, with an annual total loss-of-QALE of 28, 463 QALYs and total lifetime healthcare expenditures of US$ 36. 6 million. Successful prevention of eight <b>work-related</b> <b>cancers</b> would not only avoid the occurrence of 3736 cases of cancer, but would also save more than US$ 70 million in healthcare costs and 46, 750 QALYs for the Taiwan society in 2010...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Skin {{cancer is}} the most common {{malignancy}} in Caucasian populations worldwide and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is known for being the number one carcinogen. As, especially in outdoor workers, UVR is an inevitable carcinogen, the prevention and management of UVR-related skin cancers in these at-risk populations represent a collective challenge for dermatologists and healthcare policymakers likewise. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview on the current regulations on the acknowledgement and management of <b>work-related</b> skin <b>cancer</b> in 11 European countries. METHODS: Dermatologists from 11 countries networking within the EU Horizon 2020 COST Action TD 1206 'StanDerm' contributed to a standardized survey regarding current national regulations, implemented for the recognition, prevention and management as well as possible compensation regulations in their individual country of residence. RESULTS: Ten of 11 participating countries in this survey reported the existence of an established programme available on certain occupational diseases; work-related skin diseases were only specifically recognized in eight countries. Seven of 11 countries recognize cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in outdoor workers as 'occupational skin cancer'. Basal cell carcinoma (6 of 11), actinic keratosis (5 of 11), Bowen's disease (5 of 11) and malignant melanoma (5 of 11) are not as regularly approved as potentially 'work-induced'. Only a few of the countries included into this survey established a general documentation system (national registry) on occupational skin diseases. So far, representatives of only three countries of this survey referred to a specific established national programme for the prevention, management or compensation of occupational skin <b>cancers</b> acquired during <b>work-related</b> UVR exposure. CONCLUSION: This survey highlights the need for mandatory regulations on the prevention, management and potential compensation of <b>work-related</b> UV-induced skin <b>cancer</b> across Europe. Against the background of a joint European domestic market, equal standards of occupational safety across Europe should include binding regulations for the protection and management of <b>work-related</b> skin <b>cancer.</b> The design of a common regulation to meet the increasing incidence of skin cancers in outdoor workers should become part of the European agenda, ensuring equal working and living conditions in the member states...|$|R
40|$|U. K. {{authorities}} {{are failing to}} acknowledge or deal effectively with an epidemic of work-related cancers. The government’s Health and Safety Executive (HSE) underestimates the exposed population, the risks faced {{as a result of}} those exposures, and the potential for pre-vention. The HSE fails to acknowledge the social inequality in occupational cancer risk, which is con-centrated in manual workers and lower employment grades, or the greater likelihood these groups will experience multiple exposures to work-related carcino-gens. It continues to neglect the largely uninvestigated and unprioritized risk to women and currently has nei-ther a requirement nor a strategy for reducing the numbers and volumes of cancer-causing substances, processes, and environments at work. The result is that the U. K. faces at least 20, 000 and possibly in excess of 40, 000 new cases of <b>work-related</b> <b>cancer</b> every year, leading to thousands of deaths and an annual cost to the economy of between £ 29. 5 bn and £ 59 bn.

40|$|AbstractObjetivesUnderreporting of <b>work-related</b> <b>cancer</b> in the Basque Country (Spain) is massive. The aim of {{our study}} is to {{estimate}} the job-related cancer in the Basque Country in 2008 treated by the Basque Public Health System-Osakidetza, {{as well as the}} medical costs derived from its treatment in the same year. MethodsScientific evidence from industrialised countries is used to estimate the number of processes of cancer attributable to work. Medical costs for specialised care (outpatient and hospital admissions) are derived from the National Health System cost accounts. Costs due to primary health care and pharmaceutical benefits are obtained from Spanish secondary sources. Figures were computed according to disease and sex. ResultsWe estimate 1, 331 work-attributable cancers hospitalizations and 229 work-attributable cancers specialized ambulatory cases. Medical costs borne by public health care system exceed 10 million euros. Specialized care accounts for 64. 2 % of the total cost. Bronchus and lung cancer represents the largest percentage of total expenditure (27 %), followed by the bladder cancer (12. 6 %), mesothelioma (8. 6 %), the colon cancer (7. 3 %), and stomach (6. 7 %). ConclusionsThe magnitude of cancer attributable to work in the Basque Country is much higher than reflected in the official Registry of Occupational Diseases. Underreporting of work-related cancers hampers prevention and shifts funding of medical costs from social security to the tax-financed public health system...|$|E
40|$|ABOUT THE BOOK As {{the title}} Safety or Profit? suggests, {{health and safety}} at work needs to be {{understood}} {{in the context of}} the wider political economy. This book brings together contributions informed by this view from internationally recognized scholars. It reviews the governance of health and safety at work, with special reference to Australia, Canada, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Three main aspects are discussed. The restructuring of the labor market: this is considered with respect to precarious work and to gender issues and their implications for the health and safety of workers. The neoliberal agenda: this is examined with respect to the diminished power of organized labor, decriminalization, and new governance theory, including an examination of how well the health-and-safety-at-work regimes put in place in many industrial societies about forty years ago have fared and how distinctive the recent emphasis on self-regulation in several countries really is. The role of evidence: there is a dearth of evidence-based policy. The book examines how policy on health and safety at work is formulated at both company and state levels. Cases considered include the scant regard paid to evidence by an official inquiry into future strategy in Canada; the lack of evidence-based policy and the reluctance to observe the precautionary principle with respect to <b>work-related</b> <b>cancer</b> in the United Kingdom; and the failure to learn from past mistakes in the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Intended Audience: Researchers; policymakers, trade union representatives, and officials interested in OHS; postgraduate students of OHS; OHS professionals; regulatory and socio-legal scholars...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Determining the work-relatedness of {{lung cancer}} {{developed}} through occupational exposures is very difficult. Aims {{of the present study}} are to develop a decision tree of occupational lung cancer Methods: 153 cases {{of lung cancer}} surveyed by the Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute (OSHRI) from 1992 - 2007 were included. The target variable was whether the case was approved as <b>work-related</b> lung <b>cancer,</b> and independent variables were age, sex, pack-years of smoking, histological type, type of industry, latency, working period and exposure material in the workplace. The Classification and Regression Test (CART) model was used in searching for predictors of occupational lung cancer. Results: In the CART model, the best predictor was exposure to known lung carcinogens. The second best predictor was 8. 6 years or higher latency and the third best predictor was smoking history of less than 11. 25 pack-years. The CART model must be used sparingly in deciding the work-relatedness of lung cancer because it is not absolute. Conclusion: We found that exposure to lung carcinogens, latency and smoking history were predictive factors of approval for occupational lung cancer. Further studies for work-relatedness of occupational disease are needed...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to discuss}} notions of {{supportive}} care, nursing {{care and the}} impact of providing that care for oncology nurses. Role-related stress and burnout in oncology nurses are challenges that require effective management strategies at both organisational and personal levels. Oncology nurses, as do others, strive to provide exemplary nursing care for people affected by cancer which demands the provision of a total package of care that comprises physical, psychosocial, cultural and spiritual needs. These needs change over time from diagnosis through to end of life 1, 2, 3. One source of stress for many oncology nurses is the attempt to manage tensions that arise from trying to provide a person-centred approach to care in a biomedically driven and physically focused health care delivery system 4. The three key strategies of self-awareness, self-care and resilience development for managing <b>work-related</b> stress for <b>cancer</b> nurses will be discussed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Transitional bladder {{cancer is}} the most {{frequent}} malignant urinary neoplasm. Occupational exposure to aromatic amines and to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are the main risk factors, in addition to cigarette smoking, recurrent inflammatory diseases of the urinary tract, consumption of certain drugs and a positive family history. Nevertheless cases of <b>work-related</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> are poorly identified in Italy. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the screening accuracy of a short structured interview to detect suspected cases of occupational bladder cancer, which may be confirmed in a second step assessment by an occupational physician. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 94 transitional bladder cancer patients, first hospitalised in 2004 and 2005 at the Department of Urology of the Ospedale di Circolo - Fondazione Macchi, in Varese, Italy. Based on data collected through a simple structured interview, it was possible to estimate two occupational exposure indices: one taking into account only the length of employment in industrial settings (DS Index) and the other considering job title in addition (DSM Index). For all cases a second-step assessment by an occupational physician (gold standard) made it possible to establish the occupational origin of cancer and to assess accuracy. RESULTS: Satisfactory values of the area under the ROC curve were found for both indices (AUC 0, 81 for DS and 0, 87 for DSM). In particular at the same level of sensitivity (90 %), the DSM Index showed a better specificity (72 %) in comparison to the DS Index (64 %). CONCLUSIONS: The short structured interview proposed here proved to be a valuable tool for general practitioners and urologists to detect cases of bladder cancer of suspected occupational aetiology, which can be referred to an occupational physician for further investigations...|$|R
40|$|Record linkage {{studies have}} been used for decades to study {{occupational}} diseases and mortality. While low response rates represent an increasing problem in connection with sample surveys, response rates at cen-suses in the Nordic countries are close to 100 %. The linking of census data with data about mortality, emigration and cancer by the unique personal identification numbers, ensures complete information on relevant events. Results from a large census-based Nordic study on cancer incidence by occupation are presented, and advantages and problems related to such type of studies are discussed. In record linkage studies occupational group, socio-economic status or any other characteristic may be used as the exposure indicator. The results of such studies usually must be interpreted in light of established etiologic associa-tions. The two main purposes with record linkage studies are that they may be used as reference material in the general description of cancer incidence and distribution in a population, and that they serve as a basis for generation of hypotheses to be tested in analytical studies with more detailed information. The potential for using death certificate data for the surveillance of occupational hazards was envisioned nearly 150 years ago when the first occupational mor-tality statistics were published for England and Wales in 1855 (Registrar General, 1855). The earliest study of occupational mortality based on the linkage of individual death certificates and census records was done in the United States based on a 4 -month follow-up of a sample of the 1960 census population (Kitagawa & Hauser, 1973). In Norway a similar study based on deaths in 1960 - 64 was pub-lished in 1974 (Tønnesen, 1974), and later a 10 -year follow up of the Swedish 1960 population was pub-lished (Statistiska Centralbyrån, 1982). More recently, a joint Nordic study on <b>work-related</b> <b>cancer</b> was pub-lished in a comprehensive analysis based on more than 10 million persons (Andersen et al, 1999) ...|$|E
40|$|Fire fighters face many hazards in {{the line}} of duty. The risks of severe and {{potentially}} fatal injuriesfrom the dangerous environment of a fire scene are well known. Additionally, fires generate toxic contaminants, some that are known or suspected to cause cancer. Less is known about long term health effects fire fighters may experience as a result of such work-related exposures. One {{question is whether or not}} fire fighters are more at risk for developing cancer. In 2010, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) embarked on a multi-year effort to conduct a large-scale study to better understand the potential link between fire fighting and cancer. Initial findings were recently published in Occupational and Environmental Medicine. We found that a combined population of fire fighters from three large U. S. cities showed higher-than-expected rates of certain types of cancer than the general U. S. population. Our findings suggest that fire fighters may be at higher risk of digestive, oral, respiratory, and urinary system cancers than the general population. In summary, these findings strengthen the evidence that fire fighting may increase cancer risks. The current findings are the first product from the study. Our next step is to examine the relationship between <b>work-related</b> exposures and <b>cancer</b> among the fire fighters in our study. We hope to have this assessment completed within the next year. See below for further details about the study and results. FAQ-NIOSHFFCancerStudy. pd...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} and descriptive study is {{to contribute to the}} sparse return-to-work literature on head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors. Interview participants were asked to reflect upon their <b>work-related</b> experience with <b>cancer</b> by answering two specific questions: (1) What advice would you give someone who has been newly diagnosed with head and neck cancer? (2) What advice would you give to employers of these people? Data were gathered through 10 individual semi-structured in-depth interviews with HNC clinic patients at a regional cancer center's head and neck clinic in Ontario, Canada. A constant comparative method of theme development was used. Codes identified in and derived from the data were discussed by research team members until consensus was reached. Codes with similar characteristics were grouped together and used to develop overarching themes. Work-related advice for peers focused on personal self-care and interactions within workplaces. Work-related advice to employers focused on demonstrating basic human values as well as the importance of communication. The study results suggest HNC clinic patients should be proactive with employers and help to set reasonable expectations and provide a realistic plan for work to be successfully completed. HNC clinic patients should develop communication skills to effectively disclose their cancer and treatment to employers. In this exploratory study, HNC clinic patients' advice was solution-focused underscoring the importance of self-care and pro-active communication and planning with employers. Employers were advised to demonstrate core human values throughout all phases of the work disability episode beginning at diagnosi...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Commercial {{airline pilots}} {{are exposed to}} cosmic {{radiation}} and other potentially carcinogenic elements during work and leisure activities. HYPOTHESIS: <b>Work-related</b> factors affect <b>cancer</b> pattern of the pilots. METHODS: A cohort of 10, 051 male and 160 female airline pilots from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden was followed for cancer incidence through the national cancer registries. There were 177, 000 person-years at follow-up, 51, 000 of them accumulated after 20 yr {{since the time of}} first employment. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were defined as ratios of observed over expected numbers of cases based on national cancer incidence rates. Dose-response analyses were done with Poisson regression method. RESULTS: Among male pilots, there were 466 cases of cancer diagnosed vs. 456 expected. The only significantly increased SIRs concerned skin cancer: melanoma 2. 3 (95 % CI 1. 7 - 3. 0), squamous cell cancer 2. 1 (1. 7 - 2. 8), and basal cell carcinoma 2. 5 (1. 9 - 3. 2). The relative risk of skin cancers increased with the time since first employment, the number of flight hours, and the estimated radiation dose. There was an increase in the relative risk of prostate cancer with increasing number of flight hours in long-distance aircraft (p trend 0. 01). No increased incidence was found for acute myeloid leukemia or brain cancer which were of interest a priori based on earlier studies. CONCLUSIONS: This large study, based on reliable cancer incidence data, showed an increased incidence of skin cancer. It did not indicate a marked increase in cancer risk attributable to cosmic radiation although some influence of cosmic radiation on skin cancer cannot be entirely excluded...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{occupational}} {{hazards of}} working in the interventional laboratory have been inadequately studied for physicians and remain unaddressed for nonphysician personnel. ObjectivesThis study sought {{to determine whether the}} prevalence of <b>work-related</b> musculoskeletal pain, <b>cancer,</b> and other medical conditions is higher among physicians and allied staff who work in interventional laboratories compared with employees who do not. MethodsMayo Clinic employees who work in affiliated hospitals with interventional cardiology or interventional radiology laboratories took an electronic survey. Results were stratified on the basis of self-reported occupational exposure to procedures that involve radiation. ResultsThere were 1, 543 employees (mean age 43 ± 11. 3 years, 33 % male) who responded to the survey (response rate of 57 %), and 1, 042 (67. 5 %) reported being involved with procedures utilizing radiation. These employees reported experiencing work-related pain more often than the control group before (54. 7 % vs. 44. 7 %; p < 0. 001) and after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions, years in profession, and job description (odds ratio: 1. 67; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 32 to 2. 11; p < 0. 001). Musculoskeletal pain varied significantly by job description, with the highest incidence reported by technicians (62 %) and nurses (60 %) followed by attending physicians (44 %) and trainees (19 %; p < 0. 001). There was no difference in cancer prevalence between groups (9 % vs. 9 %; p = 0. 96). ConclusionsMusculoskeletal pain is more common among healthcare workers who participate in interventional procedures and is highest in nonphysician employees. The diagnosis of cancer in employees who participate in procedures that utilize radiation was not elevated when compared to controls within the same departments, although any conclusion regarding causality is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the study, as well as the low overall prevalence of malignancy in our study group...|$|R
