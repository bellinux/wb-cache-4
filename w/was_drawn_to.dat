Unlike his older brother Imre, {{who worked at the}} exchange in Budapest for all his life, Kertész had little interest in the field.

In the aftermath, Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) emerged as the dominant force in prosperity televangelism, having brought Robert Tilton and Benny Hinn to prominence.|$|E

5|$|Cecil <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> {{resemble}} David Hyde Pierce, {{but still}} look similar to Bob. According to director Pete Michels, {{it was difficult}} to draw Bob and Cecil standing together because their feet are both so big. There was a scene featuring Hans Moleman and his house, which was cut, but his house can still briefly be seen in the scene where Cecil throws Bart off a cliff. The sequence was cut in order {{to make room for the}} explanation of why Bob was sent back to prison. Ken Keeler has said that it is his favorite deleted scene.|$|E

5|$|Rocco Landesman, {{chairperson}} of the National Endowment for the Arts, has used Citygarden {{as an example of}} a successful foundation-funded art venture. Landesman—a former resident of St. Louis—said that such projects can help urban areas economically, but they cannot be funded solely by the federal government, thus requiring assistance from both the private sector and foundations. Michael Van Valkenburgh, principal of a Brooklyn landscape architecture firm, said he <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> St. Louis partly because of Citygarden's design and success. Van Valkenburgh was selected in 2010 to renovate the grounds of the Gateway Arch.|$|E

5|$|Soedjatmoko later {{attended}} the Surabaya HBS (secondary school) and graduated in 1940. The school {{introduced him to}} Latin and Greek, {{and one of his}} teachers introduced him to European art; he later recalled that this introduction had allowed him to see Europeans as more than colonists. He then continued to medical school in Batavia (modern day Jakarta). Upon seeing the slums of Jakarta, he <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> the issue of poverty; this later became an academic interest of his. However, during the Japanese occupation, in 1943, he was expelled from the city due to his relationship with Sutan Sjahrir– who had married Soedjatmoko's sister Siti Wahyunah– and participation in protests against the occupation.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} boundary <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> {{include the}} highest concentration of historic resources. The street plan dates to 1787 {{and the most}} recent historic building dates to 1940, making those years the period of significance. While some newer buildings are inevitably located within the area, the boundary, where possible, excluded significant mid and late 20th-century buildings like the city hall, low-income housing projects, and the Uncle Sam Atrium, a large shopping mall downtown. All of the original five historic districts are included in full, along with other historic neighborhoods, for a total of 10% of the city's area.|$|E
5|$|After {{a meeting}} between Scott and Zaillian on another project, Zaillian brought the project up again with Scott, who decided {{he was ready to}} do it. Producer Brian Grazer and Imagine {{executive}} Jim Whitaker decided against pursuing George's attempt and to return to Zaillian's vision. In February 2006, Ridley Scott entered talks with the studio to take over American Gangster from George, returning to Zaillian's draft as the film's basis. Washington returned to his role as Lucas, and Russell Crowe was attached to star as Roberts. Crowe <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> the project based on his previous work with the director on Gladiator and A Good Year, while Washington wanted to work with Crowe again, after 1995's Virtuosity. Production was slated in summer 2006.|$|E

5|$|Ashlynn Yennie as Jenny, {{the rear}} {{section of the}} centipede. As with Williams, The Human Centipede was Yennie's first major film role. Yennie {{was one of several}} actresses to {{audition}} for the role, as the producers searched for an actress who would have good on-screen chemistry with Williams. Yennie was able to further develop her relationship with Williams when the pair shared an apartment in the Netherlands during filming. Yennie auditioned to Ilona Six, sister of Tom Six and the film's producer, and did not meet Tom Six, who had viewed tapes of her reading, until fitting for the centipede special effects in the Netherlands. Yennie <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> the role by the humanity throughout the story, referring to how the three victims of Heiter are unwillingly forced into their situation. She also said the story was so realistic it scared her.|$|E

He had not played a tournament since February 2014, but he started the 2015 Apia International Sydney with a straight-sets win against Sergiy Stakhovsky. In the second round, his {{opponent}} was world No. 19 and top seed Fabio Fognini. It was a tough test for del Potro, but he proved to be stronger than the Italian. Del Potro was through to the quarterfinals, but lost to Mikhail Kukushkin in two tiebreakers. After his Sydney campaign, he <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> play Jerzy Janowicz {{in the first round of}} the 2015 Australian Open, del Potro withdrew due to his wrist injury.
