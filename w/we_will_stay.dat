[...] In Kismayo, executive leader of the ICU, Sharif Sheikh Ahmed was defiant, [...] "We will not run away from our enemies.

500|$|On the Union side, Doubleday reorganized {{his lines}} as more {{units of the}} I Corps arrived. First on hand was the Corps Artillery under Col. Charles S. Wainwright, {{followed}} by two brigades from Doubleday's division, now commanded by Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Rowley, which Doubleday placed on either end of his line. The XI Corps arrived from the south before noon, moving up the Taneytown and Emmitsburg Roads. Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard was surveying the area {{from the roof of}} the Fahnestock Brothers' dry-goods store downtown at about 11:30 when he heard that Reynolds had been killed and that he was now in command of all Union forces on the field. He recalled: [...] "My heart was heavy and the situation was grave indeed, but surely I did not hesitate a moment. God helping us, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> here till the Army comes. I assumed the command of the field." ...|$|E
500|$|Maria Amélia and her mother, who had {{accompanied}} her, disembarked on 31 August in Funchal, {{the capital of}} Madeira. The entire town greeted her joyfully, and a crowd followed the princess to her new home. She adored the island and told her mother: [...] "If I one day recover my previous robust health, isn't that so mommy, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> {{a long time in}} this island. We will make long excursions in the mountains, we will find new paths, just as we did in Stein!" [...] But her health worsened, {{and by the end of}} November, all hope was gone. By the beginning of 1853, the princess was bedridden, and she knew death was approaching: [...] "My strength diminishes from day to day; I can feel it... we are reaching the beginning of the end." [...] A little after midnight in the early hours of 4 February, a priest administered the last rites. Maria Amélia tried to comfort her mother: [...] "Do not cry... let God's will be done; may He come to my aid in my last hour; may He console my poor mother!" [...] She died later that morning at around 04:00.|$|E

50|$|Tully {{tries to}} {{set fire to}} the disputed grassland, but he is killed by Fred, a farmer who earlier had lost a leg in the ranch war.

2500|$|The last {{track is}} a {{patriotic}} titled [...] "Sawfa Nabqa" [...] (<b>We</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Stay).</b> Joseph Khalifeh contributed Said Akl’s text into a symphonic piece {{to deliver a}} strong worded message to all Lebanese people to unity and freedom and to show how Lebanese managed to stay faithful {{no matter what their}} country faced through years. The song was arranged by Kamal Saiqali with wonderful choice of instruments and orchestration and it extended to more than two octaves and Majida hit a high A5 during a long interval of opera. Majida’s most important performance for this song was in 2005 during a concert in Beirut Downtown, in the Martyrs’ Square on 13 April, in the memory of the Lebanese Civil War beginnings: ...|$|E
2500|$|The saying {{became a}} staple of Israeli speech. Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin co-opted the phrase as an {{election}} campaign slogan in 1981. [...] It was also used by former Soviet refusenik and Israeli Yisrael BaAliyah party leader and Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, in 1998. [...] The Israeli National Lottery Board spoofed it in a television commercial, in which a winning racehorse with an American accent stated: [...] "We are on the racetrack, and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> on the racetrack." [...] Similarly, when Israel's Davis Cup team beat the powerhouse Russian Davis Cup team in a shocking victory in the 2009 Davis Cup tennis quarter-finals, Prime Minister Netanyahu telephoned the Israel Tennis Association Director General and echoed Brody's statement of over three decades earlier, saying: [...] "We're back on the map".|$|E
60|$|Also in Isaiah 8:9,10 and in Isaiah 2:12,13, {{you have}} in sum the same thing {{inserted}} again. But <b>we</b> <b>will</b> not <b>stay</b> upon proof, but will proceed to demonstration hereof.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, they haven't {{concerned}} {{themselves about}} me, {{and it is}} quite right they should not. It is all as it should be, and Thomasin at least is happy. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> not <b>stay</b> any longer now, as they will soon be coming out to go home." ...|$|R
3000|$|Before {{dealing with}} {{gradient}} flows in general metric spaces, {{the best way}} to clarify the situation is to start from the easiest case, i.e. what happens in the Euclidean space [...] R^n. Most of what <b>we</b> <b>will</b> say <b>stays</b> true in an arbitrary Hilbert space, but <b>we</b> <b>will</b> stick to the finite-dimensional case for simplicity.|$|R
2500|$|Montgomery was {{determined}} that the Army, Navy and Air Forces should fight their battles in a unified, focused manner according to a detailed plan. He ordered immediate reinforcement of the vital heights of Alam Halfa, just behind his own lines, expecting the German commander, Erwin Rommel, to attack with the heights as his objective, something that Rommel soon did. Montgomery ordered all contingency plans for retreat to be destroyed. [...] "I have cancelled the plan for withdrawal. If we are attacked, {{then there will be}} no retreat. If we cannot stay here alive, then <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> here dead", he told his officers at the first meeting he held with them in the desert, though, in fact, Auchinleck had no plans to withdraw from the strong defensive position he had chosen and established at El Alamein.|$|E

6000|$|... "My dear Caroline," [...] he began,--"ah, {{you must}} forgive me. I {{did not know}} that you were engaged. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> not <b>stay,</b> but I should like to present to you a young friend of mine who is going to help me at the meeting this evening." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Keep it, to be sure!' {{replied the}} old woman briskly. 'It is all {{nonsense}} about it not laying eggs. Anyway, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> let it <b>stay</b> here for a bit, and see what happens.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Allow you, Elfie!' said Knight, {{putting his}} arm round her and drawing her closer. 'I am twice as happy with you by my side. Yes: <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay,</b> {{and watch the}} {{approach}} of day.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my deary, you'll get {{so tired}} and hot you won't {{have a good}} time. Wait till I go, and then <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> all day, and pick as many berries as you want." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mrs. Trevelyan will {{understand}} us better {{when she is}} less excited," [...] said Priscilla. [...] "I am not surprised {{that she should be}} indignant now.

6000|$|Marian {{perceived}} his emotion, {{but rather}} than seem to notice it, she assumed a sort of gaiety. [...] "I'll tell you, Edmund.

6000|$|... "He {{may have}} dyed his skin," [...] the officer said. [...] "At any rate, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> until he returns, and {{question}} him. Two of my men shall take their places {{just inside the}} entrance, and seize him as he enters. Has he arms?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{seems to}} be plenty of bush and cover, all along the bank, Zaki. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> here till the evening, and then move three miles farther down; so {{that you may be}} handy, if I have to leave the Dervishes in a hurry." ...|$|E
60|$|But we {{are almost}} there--look, look, Sorgono, {{nestling}} beautifully among the wooded slopes in front. Oh magic little town.

6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Bridge, [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> just <b>stay</b> where <b>we</b> are {{until after}} dark.

No one can {{know that we are}} here and if we stay here until late to-night {{we should be able to}} pass around Payson unseen and reach the wood to the south of town. If we do meet anyone to-night we'll stop them and inquire the way to Oakdale--that'll throw them off the track." ...|$|R
6000|$|O cool is {{the valley}} now [...] And there, love, <b>will</b> <b>we</b> go [...] For many a choir is singing now [...] Where Love did {{sometime}} go.
