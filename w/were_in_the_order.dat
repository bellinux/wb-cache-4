Documentation filed with the Charity Commission indicated that 's annual donations <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of only £500,000, suggesting the need for significant extra financial support to fund the building project. It was suggested that the project would be funded by Saudi Salafi groups. This was based on Tablighi Jamaat's being a Deobandi Muslim organisation that has close links with {{the form of the}} religion practised by the Saudi royal family.|$|E
25|$|The separate, {{waterless}} {{collection and}} treatment of urine and feces in UDDTs prevents hormones, pharmaceutical residues and other micro-pollutants which are contained in human excreta from entering surface water or groundwater via treated sewage. This is because in conventional sewage treatment plants, these micro-pollutants are only partially removed and the remainder is discharged into surface water, possibly reaching the groundwater. Detected concentrations of pharmaceutical residues in groundwater <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of 50ng/L in several locations in Germany.|$|E
25|$|The treated {{effluent}} from {{sewage treatment}} plants may also reach the aquifer if the effluent is infiltrated or discharged to local surface water bodies. Therefore, those substances {{that are not}} removed in conventional sewage treatment plants may reach the groundwater as well. For example, detected concentrations of pharmaceutical residues in groundwater <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of 50ng/L in several locations in Germany. This is because in conventional sewage treatment plants, micro-pollutants such as hormones, pharmaceutical residues and other micro-pollutants contained in urine and feces are only partially removed and the remainder is discharged into surface water, from where it may also reach the groundwater.|$|E

2500|$|The popular {{theory of}} atomic {{structure}} {{at the time}} of Rutherford's experiment was the [...] "plum pudding model". This model was devised by Lord Kelvin and further developed by J. J. Thomson. Thomson was the scientist who discovered the electron, and that it was a component of every atom. Thomson believed the atom was a sphere of positive charge throughout which the electrons were distributed, a bit like plums in a Christmas pudding. The existence of protons and neutrons was unknown at this time. They knew atoms were very tiny (Rutherford assumed they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>order</b> of 10−8 m in radius).
