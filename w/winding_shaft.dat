Here you ring a bell, which a highly respectable person answers (a per- son perceptibly affiliated, again, to the old regime), after which she ushers you across a vestibule into an inner court. Perhaps the strongest impression I got at Chambord came to me as I stood in this court. The woman who admitted me did not come with me; I was to find my guide somewhere else. The specialty of Chambord is its prodigious round towers. There are, I believe, no less than eight of them, placed at each angle of the inner and outer square of buildings; for the castle {{is in the form of}} a larger structure which encloses a smaller one. One of these towers stood before me in the court; it seemed to fling its shadow over the place; while above, as I looked up, the pinnacles and gables, the enormous chimneys, soared into the bright blue air.

During the next seven years, a further four electrically driven rope haulages were installed, freeing up 44 horses and raising output to 1700 tons per day.|$|E

[...] The colliery had two shafts, a <b>winding</b> <b>shaft</b> and a smaller diameter pumping shaft for draining the colliery. The colliery suffered a significant accident on 21 December 1852 when a firedamp explosion killed 10 miners and injured 12. The inquiry found that the explosion had been caused by reckless behaviour of the colliers; a ventilation door had been propped open which resulted in firedamp accumulating and some colliers using unguarded safety lamps. Earl Fitzwilliam's mine superintendent, Benjamin Biram was criticised by the inquiry for absence of printed rules in the colliery, inadequate maintenance of lamps and poor supervision of the workforce but the judge praised the ventilation arrangements in the pit which prevented extensive loss of life.|$|E

One of these lines, which moved across the B-scale array and was penetrated by several aircraft, is described in detail. The structure of the cloud and precipitation fields, obtainedfrom the analysis of satellite and radar data, indicates that intenseprecipita-tion occurred mainly {{at the leading edge}} of the line where new cells were continuously generating. Cross-sections through the line (from boom, aircraft and tethered balloon data) show a gust front at the surface, a downdraft region associated with the rain area, and a <b>wind</b> <b>shaft</b> in the lowest 300 m.
