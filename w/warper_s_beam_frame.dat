40|$|The work {{investigates the}} {{application}} of a novel frame model to reduce the computational cost of the mistuning analysis of bladed disc systems. A full-scale finite element (FE) model of the bladed disc is considered as benchmark. The single blade frame configuration is identified via an optimization process. The individual blades are then assembled by 3 D springs, whose parameters are determined via calibration process. The dynamics of the novel <b>beam</b> <b>frame</b> assembly is also compared to those obtained from three state-of-the-art FE-based reduced order models (ROMs) : a lumped parameter approach; a Timoshenko beam assembly, and component mode synthesis (CMS) based techniques with free and fixed interfaces. The development of these classical ROMs to represent the bladed disc is also addressed in detail. A methodology to perform the mistuning analysis is then proposed and implemented. A comparison of the modal properties and forced response dynamics between the aforementioned ROMs and the full-scale FE model is presented. The case study demonstrates that the <b>beam</b> <b>frame</b> assembly can predict the variations of the blade amplitude factors with results being in agreement with the full-scale FE model. The CMS based ROMs underestimate the maximum amplitude factor, while the results obtained from <b>beam</b> <b>frame</b> assembly are generally conservative. The <b>beam</b> <b>frame</b> assembly is 4 times more computationally efficient than the CMS fixed-interface approach. This study proves that the <b>beam</b> <b>frame</b> assembly can efficiently predict the mistuning behavior of bladed discs when low order modes are of interest...|$|R

Using this method, NATASHA (Nonlinear Aeroelastic Trim And Stability for HALE Aircraft) has been updated so that it is now capable of analyzing joined-wing configurations. This new formulation is based on the fully intrinsic equations, which intro-duce neither singularities and nor infinite-degree nonlinearities caused by finite rotation. The formulation makes use of an incremental form of the kinematical equations, which allows preservation of the main advantageous features of the fully intrinsic equations.

In {{order to}} {{research}} the seismic behavior of lightweight aggregate concrete-filled rectangular steel tubular (CFRST) frame, four test specimens were experimentally studied under constant axial load and cyclically lateral load.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} the results of a self-consistent {{calculation}} of CSR effects on a particle bunch moving through the benchmark Zeuthen bunch compressors. The theoretical framework is based on a 4 D Vlasov-Maxwell approach including shielding from the vacuum chamber. We calculate the fields in the lab frame, where time is the independent variable, and evolve the phase space density/points in the <b>beam</b> <b>frame,</b> where arc length, s, along a reference orbit, is the independent variable. Some details are given in [2], where we also discuss three approaches, the unperturbed source model (UPS), the self consistent Monte Carlo (SCMC) method and the method of local characteristics. Results for the UPS have been presented for 5 GeV before [3], here we compare them with our new results from the SCMC and study the 500 MeV case. Our work using the method of characteristics is in progress. The SCMC algorithm begins by randomly generating an initial ensemble of <b>beam</b> <b>frame</b> phase space points according to a given initial phase space density. The algorithm then reduces to laying out one arc length step. Assume that at arc length s we know the location of the phase space points and the history of the source prior to s. We then (1) create a smooth representation of the lab frame charge and current densities, {rho}{sub L} and J{sub L}, (2) calculate the fields at s from the history of {rho}{sub L} and J{sub L}, and (3) move the <b>beam</b> <b>frame</b> phase space points according to the <b>beam</b> <b>frame</b> equations of motion. This is then iterated. The UPS calculation is similar except the fields are calculated from a function of s computed a priori from the <b>beam</b> <b>frame</b> equations of motion without the self-fields. The phase space points are then evolved according to the equations of motion with these ''unperturbed'' fields. In the UPS we use a Gaussian initial density which evolves under the linear <b>beam</b> <b>frame</b> equations as a Gaussian. This gives us an analytic formula for the source, which significantly speeds up the field calculation. It turns out that the evolution of the unperturbed charge density for an initial Gaussian gives a reasonable estimate of the support of the self-consistently calculated charge density in our study so far. This allows us to follow the phase space points in a fixed grid region defined by the mean center of the Gaussian and an orthonormal transformation which takes the Gaussian ellipses into circles. We put the 5 {sigma} circle into the square [- 1, 1] and take this as our basic region for the calculation. Thus at s we have the spatial position of the particles scattered in this square. We then construct a smooth spatial density using a 2 D Fourier expansion on the square, calculating the Fourier coefficients from the scattered data, as a Monte Carlo integration. This is a common technique in statistical estimation [4]. This (analytical) density on the square is then used to calculate the source for the field calculation on grid points. Typically we use 32 x 32 grid points and 16 x 16 Fourier coefficients. The fields are calculated at the grid points and the scattered phase space points are moved by interpolating the fields...|$|R
